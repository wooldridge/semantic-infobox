&amp;#12;Guidance Notes on&#13;
Services for the Urban Poor&#13;
A Practical Guide for Improving&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In 2006â&#128;&#147;07, the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) initiated research to identify barriers to service&#13;
delivery for the urban poor. The findings of the research were presented in the Guidance Notes on&#13;
Improving Water Supply and Sanitation Services to the Urban Poor in India. The Urban Global Practice&#13;
Team of WSP decided to expand the work to a global context. The Guidance Notes provide a systematic&#13;
analysis of the barriers to service delivery for the urban poor and recommend practical solutions and&#13;
strategies to overcome these barriers. The Guidance Notes are based on an in-depth research of various&#13;
initiatives from Africa, East and South Asia, and Latin America. An accompanying volume,&#13;
Global Experiences on Expanding Services to the Urban Poor, is a documentation of â&#128;&#152;Global Case&#13;
Studiesâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;Consultations with Urban Poor Communitiesâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;

The voice of the poor, too often, is not&#13;

&#13;
Getting the poor more engaged is&#13;
essential. Project designers and service&#13;
providers often assume they know what&#13;
type of services the poor want and are&#13;
willing to pay for. It is often assumed&#13;
that the poor cannot pay for services,&#13;
which should be provided free of&#13;
charge. Such assumptions are not&#13;
always correct and often result in costly&#13;
and unsustainable supply-driven public&#13;
programs to provide services. In&#13;
contrast to common perceptions,&#13;
evidence shows that it is feasible for&#13;
many of the poor to become legitimate&#13;
customers who pay their bills. To&#13;
promote that objective, it is essential&#13;
that their opinions be heard.&#13;

Box 1: Brazil, PROSANEAR Project: People Were Asked What They Wanted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Prior to planning water supply and sanitation projects, PROSANEAR (a Portuguese acronym for the Water and Sanitation&#13;
Program for Low-Income Urban Population) teams went into communities to ask what kind of water project the people&#13;
wanted, if any, and what kind they would be willing to support with their money and labor. Residents were allowed to talk&#13;
about the full range of problems they faced, but once the discussion turned to the importance of water supply and&#13;
sanitation, they were generally eager to hear how PROSANEAR could help them. Neighborhoods were allowed to choose&#13;
from a range of simple, innovative systems that made water and sanitation affordable and environmentally appropriate for&#13;
poor crowded settlements. There were no blueprints. In many places, groups of households were batched together in a&#13;
creative condominial sewerage system approach that not only made the networks more efficient and affordable but also&#13;
forged new bonds among neighbors. PROSANEAR sought to make a permanent impact by mobilizing local clubs, as well&#13;
as womenâ&#128;&#153;s, sports, and religious groups to educate people about the importance of sanitation and to teach them how to&#13;
operate and maintain their new systems. The results were powerful, and they went far beyond the better health and&#13;
greater convenience enjoyed by 1 million people newly connected to water taps and toilets. For example, getting formal&#13;
postal addresses and water bills in their names meant they had graduated from squatter status to residentâ&#128;&#148;a new status&#13;
in society.&#13;

Box 2: Stakeholder Participation in the Slum Sanitation Program in Mumbai, India&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Slum Sanitation Program initiated by BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation in 1995 with World Bank support was&#13;
based on a demand-driven and participatory approach, in which the municipality would provide the initial capital to build&#13;
community toilet blocks, while community-based organizations (CBOs) or small local business enterprises (SLBEs) would&#13;
take full charge of O&amp;M.&#13;
&#13;
NGOs were engaged to mobilize communities, facilitate relationships with the local government, and train the&#13;
communities in essential skills and attitudes. They initially carried out a general information campaign and assessed the&#13;
willingness and readiness of the communities to participate in the sanitation scheme. Once communities mobilized and&#13;
demonstrated an interest, CBOs/SLBEs were created (if not already existing and active). These organizations were then&#13;
registered to obtain the legal status, which would allow them to manage the community sanitation block (that is, obtain&#13;
water, sewerage and electricity connections, sign a memorandum of understanding with the municipal corporation,&#13;
open and maintain a bank account to deposit the maintenance fund and earnings, pay utility bills, and so on).&#13;
It was only after the CBO or small enterprise had collected at least 50 percent of the expected maintenance&#13;
fund from prospective users and had developed a technically sound and community-endorsed plan for the&#13;
toilet block, that the municipal corporation issued the building permit and the actual construction of the community&#13;
toilet block began.&#13;
&#13;
Participation in the formal process of planning the services, creating a viable business entity, having it registered, opening&#13;
a bank account, and working with the municipal corporation provided invaluable experience, created confidence, and&#13;
inspired further entrepreneurial and community activities on the part of participants. In one case, a small enterprise that&#13;
operates the toilets has also established a pre-school in the new community center that was built adjacent to the toilet block.&#13;

   Orangi is the largest katchi abadi (informal settlement) in Karachi, Pakistan, and has a population of 1.2 million. The Orangi&#13;
   Pilot Project (OPP) was established there in 1980 by Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan, the renowned Pakistani social scientist. The&#13;
   OPP provided social and technical guidance to enable low income families to construct and maintain an underground&#13;
   sewerage system with their own funds and under their own management. The project has shown that poor people can&#13;
   finance and build sewers in their communities. Working together internally as well as with the government to achieve their&#13;
   objectives has given community members dignity as well as confidence in themselves. To date, the people of Orangi have&#13;
   laid down 1.3 million feet of sewer line and invested about PKR 57.2 million (US$2.2 million). About 900,000 people in&#13;
   94,122 houses have benefitted. The average cost of the system is very lowâ&#128;&#148;about PKR 1,000 (US$31) per household. The&#13;
   residents of Orangi maintain the system themselves at no cost to the government. The OPP Research and Training Institute&#13;
   is currently assisting initiatives in a number of other areas in Pakistan and other countries. Training in the OPP model has&#13;
   been provided to groups from Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Philippines, Central Asia, Zimbabwe,&#13;
   and South Africa.&#13;

      Box 4: Community-Based Management of Services: The Water Trust Model in Lusaka, Zambia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Lusaka, Zambia, has 33 peri-urban areas where about 1 million of the 3 million inhabitants of the city live. Water trusts are&#13;
  community-based water supply service providers in peri-urban areas of Lusaka. They currently serve 600,000 people in&#13;
  13 peri-urban areas. Starting in early 2002, the trusts were set up with the assistance of the international NGO, CARE, in&#13;
  partnership with the Lusaka City Council and Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC). The CARE project funded&#13;
  infrastructure and community capacity building. Since LWSC is responsible for providing services throughout the city and is&#13;
  the only licensed service provider by the regulator, the water trusts operate under LWSCâ&#128;&#153;s license, though the relationship&#13;
  has not as yet been formalized. The city council is a signatory to the trust accounts, facilitates the recruitment and&#13;
  appointment of board members and management staff, audits the books, and provides legal advice. Each water trust is&#13;
  governed by a board of trustees that provides policy direction, develops service strategies, and employs a scheme&#13;
  manager. The manager hires and supervises staff such as water vendors/tap attendants, plumbers, and cashiers. Each&#13;
  water vendor/tap attendant signs a contract for the operation and maintenance of a water point and receives a percentage&#13;
  of monthly sales. Residents may buy water on a daily basis or make a monthly prepayment. In some schemes, household&#13;
  connections are also an option. Tariffs and connection charges are regulated by the National Water and Sewerage&#13;
  Commission which is also supposed to regulate service qualityâ&#128;&#148;though the trusts are not in fact subject to effective&#13;
  scrutiny. An evaluation of the trust schemes, implemented by CARE in 2004, found that service levels in water trust areas&#13;
  were higher than in areas served by LWSC and that 76 percent of respondents were satisfied with the level of service. The&#13;
  trustsâ&#128;&#153; model has also resulted in a substantial improvement in cost recovery for water supply service.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 Obstacle&#13;
Water vendors, organized crime, public&#13;
officials, and utility staff may have a&#13;
vested interest in preventing better&#13;
services for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
When the poor cannot get piped water&#13;
supply services legally they are forced&#13;
to provide for themselves in some&#13;
wayâ&#128;&#148;legal or illegal. In cities with&#13;
a high percentage of unserved&#13;
population, such as Dhaka, Manila, and&#13;
Karachi, the amount of money that&#13;
passes hands informally in the water&#13;
sector to provide water to the unserved&#13;
population is reportedly greater than&#13;
the revenue of the formal service&#13;
provider. Existing vendors and other&#13;
vested interests will naturally oppose&#13;
any changes to the status quo that&#13;
threaten their sources of revenue or&#13;
political support. Sometimes&#13;
confrontations can be avoided by giving&#13;
informal and alternative service&#13;
providers new roles or incentives that&#13;
bring them into the formal system.&#13;
Ultimately, improving transparency&#13;
reduces opportunities for illicit activities.&#13;
&#13;
Incorporate&#13;
Informal Service&#13;
Providers into&#13;
the Solution&#13;
Institutional arrangements and legal&#13;
reforms that incorporate informal&#13;
service providers into the formal&#13;
solution reduce opposition and improve&#13;
transparency. Such arrangements&#13;
benefit both sides: the informal&#13;
providers gain security and legitimacy,&#13;
and the utility or alternative service&#13;
organization can take advantage of the&#13;
knowledge and skills informal providers&#13;

    Box 5: Water Kiosk Operators Unite in Kenya&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In the informal settlement of Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, more than half-a-million poor people get water from more than&#13;
    650 informal local water kiosks. The kiosk operators lay pipes, as much as 1,500 meters, to connect their storage tanks&#13;
    to the local utility network. Although the utility recommends that water be sold for Ksh 1 per jerrycan (about US$0.10), the&#13;
    prevailing price is usually Ksh 2 (the equivalent of US$1.30 per m3, or eight times the utilityâ&#128;&#153;s domestic tariff), primarily&#13;
    because of the costs associated with establishing and running water kiosks: capital investment, bribes paid to utility staff&#13;
    to obtain and retain a connection, and the high tariffs associated with higher consumption blocks. During water&#13;
    shortages, the prices are even higher, soaring to Ksh 5 or even Ksh 10 per jerrycan.&#13;
&#13;
    The utility historically had little incentive to address the problems in Kibera, because revenue collection in the settlement&#13;
    was negligible; there were many illegal connections; and the water delivered to Kibera was estimated to be less than&#13;
    10 percent of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s total consumption. Instead, the utility simply used water rationing to limit its losses. Until recently,&#13;
    the utility considered kiosk operators to be part of the problem and driving them out of business was seen as an effective&#13;
    measure to reduce unaccounted-for water.&#13;
&#13;
    In May 2004, following an intervention by WSPâ&#128;&#147;Africa, kiosk operators decided to form an association, which they called&#13;
    Maji Bora Kibera (MBK)â&#128;&#148;Swahili for â&#128;&#152;better water services for Kiberaâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#148;drafted a constitution, formed an executive&#13;
    committee, and applied for official registration. Soon a joint taskforce was formed with members from the utility, MBK, and&#13;
    WSPâ&#128;&#147;Africa. At the suggestion of the utility, MBK wrote a letter stating clearly the problems faced by water vendors and&#13;
    offering to cooperate with the regularization of their connections, pay bills regularly, stop paying bribes, report leakages,&#13;
    and expand services to unserved areas. The utility was asked to provide a regular supply of water, adopt better billing and&#13;
    collection practices, and provide engineering advice for network improvements. The letter was a watershed in&#13;
    vendor-utility relations. MBK and the utility continue to build their relationship. MBK is working on a number of initiatives to&#13;
    strengthen self-regulation and address remaining barriers to good services.&#13;
&#13;
    While there remains some concern that the association could be an obstacle to long-term change in Kibera (if the&#13;
    members were to protect their own interests at the expense of consumers), there is also a recognition that both the utility&#13;
    and vendors can gain from further collaboration.&#13;

Box 6: Community Managed Services in Tegucigalpa, Honduras&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
About 380,000 people live in poor peri-urban areas of Tegucigalpa. One-third of these peri-urban residents do not have&#13;
direct access to the water supply network and most do not have access to sewerage. Many of the peri-urban settlements&#13;
cannot be connected because of the topography (hillsides with steep slopes and unstable terrain), others because of their&#13;
illegal status, and some because of the lack of adequate resources to extend the network. The population of these areas&#13;
obtains water from a number of sources, including tankers, rainwater catchments, and community wells.&#13;
&#13;
With the assistance of several international development agencies and NGOs, the National Autonomous Water and&#13;
Sewerage Service (SANAA) is introducing alternative water and sanitation systems in these areas. These systems receive&#13;
bulk water from SANAA or its tankers but are managed internally by the community. Three water supply models are used.&#13;
The preferred model involves a metered connection to SANAAâ&#128;&#153;s network that feeds a community storage tank, to which the&#13;
secondary network within the community is connected. Where connection to the network is not feasible, the community&#13;
storage tank is supplied by tankers. The third option is a rainwater catchment and filtering system.&#13;
&#13;
A revolving fund is used to finance construction and the beneficiary community repays the fund at zero interest over&#13;
5 to 10 years. Communities that wish to benefit from this program must establish a water administration board with four&#13;
officers selected by the community. The water boards operate and maintain the systems, collect fees from the users to&#13;
cover their own costs as well as the bulk water charges and the capital cost. They organize committees and/or engage&#13;
staff to maintain the system, operate community water taps, collect fees, and prevent theft. Committees are also&#13;
established to educate the community about water use and hygiene.&#13;

Box 7: The Social Development Unit in Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, India&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has a Social Development Unit, which focuses on connecting&#13;
households in slums to piped water and sewerage. This unit is headed by a proactive senior development specialist who&#13;
interacts directly and effectively with key community groups, NGOs, and influential individuals to implement connection&#13;
programs. The unit also uses NGOs as intermediaries between the utility and the community. To promote connections, the&#13;
unit has introduced a reduced connection fee and simplified connection procedures. It also accepts â&#128;&#152;proof of occupancyâ&#128;&#153; in&#13;
lieu of the requirement for land tenure.&#13;
&#13;
Residents of slums are encouraged to connect to the BWSSB water supply system and are actively discouraged from&#13;
resorting to illegal means. Connection charges vary on the basis of house size: Rs. 550 (the equivalent of about US$13) for&#13;
houses of less than 150 square feet, Rs. 800 (about US$19) for houses of 150â&#128;&#147;600 square feet, and the full rate of&#13;
Rs. 1,800 (about US$42) for houses over 600 square feet. Slum dwellers are allowed to pay the connection charges in&#13;
two installments.&#13;

      Box 8: Engaging Local Private Operators for Water Supply and Sanitation Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Contracts with private operators, if well-designed and appropriately monitored, can be an effective way to introduce&#13;
      autonomy and accountability. Until recently, tenders for private operators of water supply and sewerage services were&#13;
      aimed at large international firms, but in a number of countries tenders are increasingly aimed at local private operators,&#13;
      particularly in small towns with 10,000 to 50,000 residents. A recent study examined the experiences of Colombia,&#13;
      Paraguay, and Uganda where local firms have been engaged to operate water supply services in large urban or&#13;
      peri-urban areas with poor populations.&#13;
&#13;
      In Colombia and Paraguay, local private operators have been engaged to construct or rehabilitate the infrastructure and&#13;
      operate the services for 15 to 20 years. In Uganda, local private operators were contracted to operate and manage,&#13;
      under low-risk, three- to five-year contracts. In Colombia, most of the operators are companies with experience in&#13;
      providing other urban services, such as solid waste management. In Paraguay, large construction companies have&#13;
      sought the contracts but they usually engage an experienced small local private operator (aguatero) to manage&#13;
      operations once construction is complete. In both countries, it is estimated that private operators contribute about&#13;
      20 percent of capital costs. The remainder is financed by grants from the national or local governments, using their own&#13;
      funds or the proceeds of World Bank loans. In Uganda, the infrastructure was built under separate contracts with&#13;
      funding from donors, and the operators can take advantage of output-based aid grants to expand connections.&#13;
&#13;
      In Colombia, the municipal government contracts the private operator. In Paraguay and Uganda, they are contracted by&#13;
      community-based user associations. In all three countries, the national governments provide support to the local&#13;
      entities during the preparation and procurement process, but the local entities assume full responsibility for day-to-day&#13;
      supervision of the operators. The contracts include very specific service targets that the operators are required&#13;
      to achieve.&#13;
&#13;
      The contracts were in their early stages at the time they were reviewed in 2005, but initial results were mostly positive.&#13;
      Previously unserved neighborhoods and small towns were getting connections. In Paraguay, the cost of government&#13;
      investment subsidies had been cut in half. One of the lessons learned in Paraguay and Uganda was that, initially, user&#13;
      associations need intensive training and support to ensure proper monitoring and a healthy relationship with the&#13;
      operator. In addition, user associations that receive a small percentage of the tariff revenues are most likely to be&#13;
      proactive and provide effective oversight.&#13;

Box 9: Successful Performance and Incentive Contracts in a Public Company:&#13;
Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s National Water and Sewerage Corporation&#13;
&#13;
The National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) is an autonomous state company that provides water and&#13;
sewerage services in the larger towns and cities of Uganda. Until 1998, in the absence of an effective accountability&#13;
framework, the NWSC had made a number of poorly conceived investments. The company was very inefficient and&#13;
financially unsustainable: its fixed assets were underutilized; unaccounted-for water was at 51 percent; it was grossly&#13;
overstaffed; and it was unable to service its debt. In 1998, a new general manager began to introduce performance&#13;
incentive programs and a client-oriented culture with a strong emphasis on service quality. Substantial improvements&#13;
resulted, but by 2000 it was clear that achieving financial sustainability would take several more years of effort. In 2000, the&#13;
Government of Uganda and the NWSC agreed to a three-year performance contract under which the latterâ&#128;&#153;s debt service&#13;
obligations were suspended in return for continued performance improvements.&#13;
&#13;
The performance contract specified the actions that the NWSC must take and the targets it was expected to meet with&#13;
regard to a number of key operational and financial indicators. A Performance Contract Review Committee was&#13;
established to monitor and report on the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s performance. In 2003, the Review Committee found that the NWSC had&#13;
performed very well with regard to qualitative targets such as updating the asset registers, introducing incentive contracts&#13;
with its area managers, and outsourcing noncore activities. It had met or come close to meeting quantitative targets for&#13;
collection efficiency, connections, metering, and staff per 1,000 connections, but had fallen short with regard to financial&#13;
performance, and remained unable to service debt. Nevertheless, the performance contract and the internal management&#13;
initiatives that had been introduced had established a solid foundation for further improvements.&#13;
&#13;
The government and the NWSC entered into a second performance contract for 2003â&#128;&#147;06, which introduced more&#13;
meaningful financial indicators based on ratios rather than absolute results. In 2003, the NWSC also began to introduce an&#13;
innovative strategy for improving its area managersâ&#128;&#153; accountability and autonomy. In January 2004, following an internal&#13;
competitive bidding process in which all area managers were allowed to participate, two-year Internally Delegated&#13;
Management Contracts were awarded for all NWSC service areas.&#13;
&#13;
By 2004, as a result of consistent improvements in operations and cash management, the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s revenues exceeded&#13;
operating costs (including depreciation) for the first time and the company was on the road to financial sustainability.&#13;
Compared with performance in 1998, by 2006, coverage in the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s service areas increased from 48 percent to&#13;
                                                                        68 percent. Total connections increased from 50,826&#13;
                                                                        to 125,000. Unaccounted-for water was 31 percent&#13;
                                                                        (35 percent in Kampala and 16 percent in other&#13;
                                                                        service areas). Annual turnover increased from about&#13;
                                                                        US$11 million to US$30 million, and operating profit&#13;

&amp;#12;      Box 10: Regulation by Contract: The Senegal Lease Contract&#13;
&#13;
      In 1995, the Government of Senegal launched wide-reaching reforms in the urban water sector. The state-run water&#13;
      company was dissolved; a new asset-holding company, SONES (SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Eaux du SÃ©nÃ©gal), was created,&#13;
      and a private operator was engaged to run the systems. These reforms resulted in significantly better services and&#13;
      financial health for the sector. The contractual framework included a concession contract and a sector development&#13;
      contract between the government and SONES, and a contract with the private operator. This last, a 10-year affermage&#13;
      (usually referred to as a â&#128;&#152;lease contractâ&#128;&#153; in Englishâ&#128;&#148;though this is not really an accurate translation), was innovative in that it&#13;
      provided financial incentives for the private operator to achieve ambitious performance targets for leakage reductions and&#13;
      improvements in billing and collection efficiency.&#13;
      The regulatory framework was built into the contract and was coherent (that is, it linked service levels to tariffs), credible,&#13;
      and transparent. SONESâ&#128;&#153;s monitoring capacity was strengthened through a practical training workshop early in the&#13;
      contract period, and an objective outside conciliateur was engaged when needed to verify performance and resolve&#13;
      conflicts. (Figure 1, on Page 44, illustrates these arrangements.) The operatorâ&#128;&#153;s remuneration was based on its&#13;
      performance and, although it was independent of the tariff, the government committed to gradually increasing tariffs to the&#13;
      full cost recovery level (including debt service) and had a strong incentive to respect this commitment because it was&#13;
      essential to ensure the financial health of the sector and expand services. Tariffs for water supply were increased about 3&#13;
      percent (in real terms) per year over the period 1996â&#128;&#147;2002.&#13;
&#13;
      Several factors contributed to the success of the reform: the use of an appropriate form of contract that was tailored to&#13;
      local conditions; strong political will and good leadership within the government; a well-designed process; and flexibility&#13;
      and innovation when it was needed. Design and preparation included the development of a financial model that could be&#13;
      used to set and revise performance targets, project revenue requirements, and calculate the associated tariff increases.&#13;
      Good relationships among the parties and an effective dispute resolution process meant that the private operator and the&#13;
      state asset-holding company were able to reach an agreement on how the former was reimbursed for lost earnings when&#13;
      the latter experienced a delay in the completion of investments. The reform has had positive outcomes for the poor, in part&#13;
      due to the nature of the operatorâ&#128;&#153;s incentives, and in part due to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s policy of subsidizing connections in&#13;
      low-income neighborhoods. However, in 2004, some issues still remained due to the tariff inequities that result when&#13;
      multiple households use a single connection, and the fact that nonpoor households were benefiting from the subsidized&#13;
      block of the tariff, especially if they consumed no more than 10 cubic meters of water per month.&#13;

them effectively. In others, particularly in&#13;
the poorer countries, municipalities&#13;
still require support from central&#13;
governments for creating effective&#13;
operating and oversight arrangements.&#13;
In all cases, both politicians and&#13;
municipal staff typically need training in&#13;
concepts and skills, particularly in&#13;
regard to distinguishing the governance&#13;
of a public service provider by the&#13;
public owners, on one hand, and&#13;
economic regulation of either a public&#13;
or a private operator on the other. If the&#13;
economic regulation of services is a&#13;
function of central, regional or state&#13;
governments, it is easier to distinguish&#13;
it from ownership governance by&#13;
municipal or other local authorities.&#13;
If local authorities share regulatory&#13;
responsibility with central, regional or&#13;
state governments, their respective&#13;
roles need to be clearly distinguished&#13;
and complementary.&#13;

     Box 12: A Partnership Helps Reach the Poor in Kisumu, Kenya&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In Kisumu, Kenya, a pilot project funded by the French Development Agency with the participation of the Water and&#13;
     Sanitation Program (WSP) has pioneered public-private partnerships between small private operators and the local water&#13;
     utility, KIWASCO, to extend and improve services in Nyalenda, a low-income community in Kisumu. WSP helped to&#13;
     prepare the project by assessing local conditions and identifying options for improving services. It then facilitated a dialog&#13;
     between KIWASCO and the participating communities that led to the choice of the partnership model. Under this model,&#13;
     the utility sells bulk water to private agents who are contracted to operate and manage the network in poor communities.&#13;
     Each private operator manages billing, collection, and minor maintenance; it also provides services such as private&#13;
     connections, shared standpipes, and commercial kiosks that are tailored to the needs of the local customers.&#13;
&#13;
     Results of phase 1 of the pilot project were encouraging: 2,700 people benefited; old â&#128;&#152;spaghetti linesâ&#128;&#153; rampant with leaks&#13;
     and illegal connections were eliminated; the cost of water consumed by the residents decreased and is now regulated;&#13;
     revenue collection increased three-fold; the likelihood of corrupt practices was reduced; the tracking and reduction of&#13;
     unaccounted-for water was improved; and KIWASCO and the private operators are working collaboratively to solve&#13;
     problems such as vandalism and illegal connections. The model has the potential for scaling up. Phase II which began&#13;
     in 2007 targets 50,000 people. In addition, a local NGO has begun to apply the model in another low-income settlement&#13;
     in Kisumu.&#13;

&#13;
    Box 14: Targeting Investment Subsidies for the Poor&#13;
&#13;
    The governments of Colombia, Cambodia, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Uganda used the proceeds of World Bank Loans&#13;
    or IDA Credits to expand and improve water services for the poor while promoting the engagement of private operators. In&#13;
    most of the cases in Colombia, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Paraguay, private operators were selected on the basis of a&#13;
    competitive process in which they specified the investment subsidy they required. In some of these, the subsidy was&#13;
    specified as lump sum investment, in others as an output-based aid (OBA) subsidy per connection. In either case, the&#13;
    subsidy is paid after the investments are completed or customers are connected. These operators are required to operate&#13;
    the systems under contracts that resemble concessions or lease contracts for 10 to 25 years and are responsible for all&#13;
    maintenance and replacements during that period. The subsidy is not intended to cover the full cost of construction; the&#13;
    unsubsidized portion is recouped from users through connection fees and tariffs over the life of the contract.&#13;
&#13;
    In Colombia, tariff rules require that the average tariff include the full cost of replacement of assets even if the initial&#13;
    investments are subsidized and there is no debt service. However, the tariff structure is such that low-income households do&#13;
    not pay any charges for capital investments. Nonpoor consumers pay tariffs that cover the full replacement cost of&#13;
    infrastructure and those in the two highest income brackets pay, in addition, a surcharge to subsidize consumers in the two&#13;
    lowest income brackets. In this way, the higher income consumers do not benefit from the investment subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
    In Uganda, the government planned and bid-out the construction and operation of water supply systems for small towns&#13;
    separately from contracts with private managers. The investments were largely funded by government grants using donor&#13;
    credits or grants and tariffs are expected to cover only operation and maintenance costs. Since almost all residents of small&#13;
    towns are considered poor, all benefited more or less equally from the investment subsidy. However, the towns were required&#13;
    to mobilize a portion of the construction cost and relatively more affluent residents were generally required to contribute more&#13;
    than less affluent residents. Uganda is now planning a pilot project under which the private firms would both construct and&#13;
    operate the systems and would receive an OBA subsidy per connection.&#13;

   It is worth noting that OBA investment subsidies are sometimes referred to as â&#128;&#152;connection subsidiesâ&#128;&#153; because they are paid on the basis of the number of connections installed. They are not necessarily&#13;
used to reduce or eliminate connection charges per se. In many OBA projects, users must still pay a connection charge.&#13;

   Box 16: Condominial Sewerage in Brasilia&#13;
&#13;
   Between 1993 and 2001, Brasiliaâ&#128;&#153;s water and sewerage utility CAESB applied the condominial model on a massive scale&#13;
   in both low-income peri-urban neighborhoods and in more affluent areas of the capital. An estimated 188,000&#13;
   condominial connections benefiting 680,000 people were installed. Sewerage treatment capacity was also increased&#13;
   using adapted technologies and it was expected that universal coverage of sewage treatment would be achieved in 2004.&#13;
&#13;
   Substantial cost savings resulted from several alternative technical practices. For example, in Santa Maria, a large&#13;
   neighborhood that typifies the system as a whole, the average public network length is about 2.8 meters per connection,&#13;
   compared with about 5.6 meters per connection for conventional systems. In addition, whereas conventional network&#13;
   design usually calls for a minimum pipe diameter of 150 millimeters, pipes of 100 millimeters were used for 56 percent of&#13;
   the system. The pipes were also laid at a minimum depth of 0.5 meters, compared to the conventional 1.0 to 1.3 meters,&#13;
   and simple inspection chambers were installed instead of high-cost manholes for 84 percent of the inspection points.&#13;
&#13;
   Throughout the metropolis, the condominial branches conformed strictly to standards of pipe location, hydraulic capacity&#13;
   material specifications, and building regulations, but a few exceptions were made to accommodate highly localized&#13;
   physical conditions. Residents at the level of each condominium were allowed to choose among three location options for&#13;
   the branch routes: through the backyard, the front yard or under the sidewalk. Routing through the yard has the&#13;
   advantage of being less expensive to install, but the household is responsible for maintenance. With the more expensive&#13;
   option of routing under the sidewalk comes the advantage that the utility assumes responsibility for maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
   As the cost of condominial branches (US$2.8 million) was borne by the beneficiaries, CAESBâ&#128;&#153;s costs (US$1.7 million)&#13;
   were much lower than for conventional sewerage. However, it was estimated that consumers paid no more for the&#13;
   condominial branches than they would have paid for conventional connections. About 1.5 percent of households opted to&#13;
   install the branches themselves and consequently paid no connection charge, but were expected to pay for materials.&#13;
   Finally, the regular sewerage charges for households that opted for routing through the yard were discounted&#13;
   by 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
   Prior to undertaking investments, CAESB undertook a process of social intermediation. During a series of meetings, the&#13;
   approach was explained and each community chose an option and signed the required agreements. This process did not&#13;
   result in any delays in the execution of the works. Especially in the lower-income communities, the mobilization efforts led&#13;
   to greater contact among neighbors and built social capital.&#13;
&#13;
   The alternative technical practices have resulted in neither a higher incidence of obstructions nor a higher cost of&#13;
   maintenance relative to the pre-existing conventional system.&#13;

            Guidance notes on services for the urban
            poor : a practical guide for improving water supply and
            sanitation services
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            To meet the Millennium Development Goals
            (MDGs) for water supply and sanitation, project planners and
            service providers and the poor themselves in developing
            countries will have to overcome a number of barriers that
            impede the improvement of services for the poor. These
            Guidance Notes identify a number of institutional, legal,
            financial, and technical barriers to providing adequate
            services to the urban poor and propose practical solutions
            based on the experience of a number of relevant cases. These
            Notes are aimed primarily at project planners, service
            providers, and community leaders but provide some
            suggestions for policymakers. A summary of policy issues is
            included in the last section.
