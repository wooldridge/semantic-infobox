            The global private infrastructure
            industry has experienced rapid growth over the past fifteen
            years, attracting some 1,700 companies. In the past,
            infrastructure was generally managed by national
            single-sector utilities, but technological and regulatory
            change has allowed companies to cross traditional
            boundaries. The authors look at the origins of companies in
            the industry and at their sectoral and geographic diversification.
