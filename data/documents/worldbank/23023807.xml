ZIEGLER: Today is April 9, 2008. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant with the World&#13;
Bank Group Oral History Program. I have with me here today in the Archives of the World&#13;
Bank Group Dr. Bernhard H. Liese. Dr. Liese joined the Bank in 1976 as an assistant for public&#13;
health in the office of the Vice President, Operations Policy. In 1980 he became deputy chief of&#13;
the Population, Health, and Nutrition Department. In 1985 he moved on to become operations&#13;
adviser and principal tropical disease specialist in that same department. From 1990 to 2000 Dr.&#13;
Liese was director of the Joint Health Services Department, which he made into one of the&#13;
leading such entities in the United States, launching many innovative programs. In 2000 Dr.&#13;
Liese became senior adviser on human development in the Africa Region. He retired from the&#13;
Bank in 2002, although he has continued his consulting activities.&#13;
&#13;
Well, Dr. Liese, Iâ&#128;&#153;m very glad you could be here today for this interview. Weâ&#128;&#153;ll start by asking&#13;
some simple background questions. When and where were you born?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I was born on April 11th, actually, 1942, in Fassberg, which is a small place. And that is&#13;
in the northern part of Germany, because my parentsâ&#128;&#148;at that time my father worked on&#13;
research, something similar to what Wernher von Braun was doing.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Rocket research, in other words?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Rocket research. Fassberg was a center for, basically, solid rocket systems and jet&#13;
engines, and PeenemÃ¼nde was the other one, so . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Please relate something of your early life and education.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Three or four years after the war had come to an end, I went back to Bonn, which is the&#13;
hometown of my family, and I went, basically, to school in Bonn.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which became the capital of the Federal Republic.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Which became the capital of the Federal Republic. My fatherâ&#128;&#153;s family were all&#13;
scientists. They came out of that corner: mathematicians, physicists. My father was a physicist.&#13;
&#13;
My motherâ&#128;&#153;s family was business, a Bonn business family, so quite a cultural issue in terms of&#13;
different outlook on life.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                 April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: But I basically grew up in Bonn. I went in Bonn to gymnasium, and then started at the&#13;
university there.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In Bonn?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: In Bonn.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How did you become a World Bank staff member? You had some other work&#13;
experiences before you came to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I initially did my medical degree, and then I did a doctorate in&#13;
parasitology on malaria at the Institute of Parasitology in Bonn, which was run by Dr. Gerhard&#13;
Piekarski, who at that time was the chairperson of the International Association of&#13;
Parasitologists, so a very well-known and reputable kind of scientist.&#13;
&#13;
I worked on malaria, but since I just had married and needed money, I switched over and did&#13;
surgery because it paid better. So I worked for a while in surgery in a hospital not far away from&#13;
Bonnâ&#128;&#148;about 30 milesâ&#128;&#148;doing a lot around accidentsâ&#128;&#148;traumatology.&#13;
&#13;
One of these days my old professor, Piekarski, came and said, â&#128;&#156;Well, would you mind going&#13;
abroad for a while?â&#128;&#157; Or something like that. And we had been looking at this earlier and had&#13;
been in negotiations with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, which had a project in Brazil on,&#13;
basically, labor union development, which I was interested in. Luckily that fell through, andâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
but my professor then got me in contact with what was called at that time GAVI, German&#13;
Technical Assistanceâ&#128;&#148;today itâ&#128;&#153;s called GTZ, the organization, Deutsche Gesellschaft fur&#13;
Technische Zusammerarbeitâ&#128;&#148;German Development Assistanceâ&#128;&#148;and I was offered a job in&#13;
Cameroon, basically as the director of a nursing and midwifery school, and we agreed to do that.&#13;
I had some experience on that point because I was in charge of training activities at the hospital,&#13;
and so we went and stayed for three and a half yearsâ&#128;&#148;almost four yearsâ&#128;&#148;in Cameroon.&#13;
&#13;
It was highly interesting because I was sitting in a government line position; so, as they say in&#13;
French, Chef de Service. What I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know before, but learned very quickly, was that the&#13;
director of the nursing and midwifery school, which was not only nurses, midwives, you know,&#13;
diplÃ´me dâ&#128;&#153;etat, but as well laboratory assistant, assistant de assainissement, hygiene assistantsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;s a whole spectrum of professions, allied professions, that this job was also that of the&#13;
deputy medical provincial officer, by Cameroonian decree. So I was quite a bit involved in the&#13;
functioning of health services in the province, the northwest province of Cameroon, 1.5 million&#13;
people, which was highly interesting.&#13;
&#13;
There were as well some Canadian technical assistance colleagues who worked the preventive&#13;
services, but there was a tremendous learning experience because one saw the world differently;&#13;
you know, how it looks if you sit really in a government line position in an LDC [less-developed&#13;
country].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which, often, Bank staff donâ&#128;&#153;t get to do.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Very rarely. Very rarely. These days there are more people coming from these&#13;
positions to the Bank, but at that time it was not that often that you had people who had worked&#13;
line positions.&#13;
&#13;
It had its difficulties, though, I have to say, because one had always to hustle for money. One&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#153;t transfer budgets from one line to another. One had to use all kinds of shortcuts; I had to&#13;
maneuver to get through. My wife became involved with a political party, with the womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
branch that helped me a lot, and so on, so many of theseâ&#128;&#148;the realities of life, but it was highly&#13;
interesting.&#13;
&#13;
And the decision to go back home was taken simply because our eldest daughter needed to go to&#13;
a decent school, to a gymnasium, and unlike in the U.K., where people are very comfortable to&#13;
send people to boarding schools, that in Germany is almost hard to accept, so the decision was&#13;
made: then if she needs to go to school, then we need to go back. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what we did, and I got&#13;
offered a job in the Ministry of Health, and I got basically the policy desk in the Federal Ministry&#13;
of Health in Bonn as the chief of that section, which was like going fromâ&#128;&#148;it was a total change&#13;
of job because suddenly I was involved in legislation which had to deal with abortion rights, et&#13;
cetera, and speechwriting for the minister. It was very interesting but as well very demanding, I&#13;
have to say, and so different from what I had done before.&#13;
&#13;
At that time I did remember that I had an offer for a scholarship from the German Research&#13;
Foundation. It had to do with my doctoral thesis. When that had been completed, my professor&#13;
had said, â&#128;&#156;Well, why donâ&#128;&#153;t you stay in the research area and continue there?â&#128;&#157; And so that&#13;
scholarship had been there, but I had not followed up on it. But I went to the German Research&#13;
Foundation; I said whether that scholarship offer would still be around and whether it could&#13;
maybe be re-packaged, because what I really would like to do is to do a master of public health&#13;
because it would give me a better kind of foundation. And they said yes, so I went to the&#13;
Harvard School of Public Health, where I was accepted, indeed did an M.P.H. at Harvard.&#13;
&#13;
In order to get the permission from the German Federal Ministry of Health to go there, I had to&#13;
do a number of studies while I was here in the States. One was on PSRO (Professional Standard&#13;
Review Organization); other ones on HMOs [health maintenance organizations], the cancer&#13;
treatment and cancer research area, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
And while I did these studies, which were highly interesting because it took me around the&#13;
States, to different parts, I looked as well at the development assistance portfolio of the United&#13;
States because I was interested in that. When I visited Washington, I went to the German&#13;
Embassyâ&#128;&#148;I was in Boston, but I was doing work here in Washingtonâ&#128;&#148;and I said that I was&#13;
interested in development. I had worked with some colleagues from the World Bank earlier in&#13;
Cameroon, but the World Bank was something which was faintâ&#128;&#148;right?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Faint, in not . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a real comprehension. I had seen colleagues coming throughâ&#128;&#148;you know,&#13;
consultants who appraised agricultural projects--but I didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a real appreciation of the Bank.&#13;
So, the attachÃ© in the World Bank said, â&#128;&#156;Let me call the German Executive Director. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll arrange&#13;
an appointment for you. You can get a better understanding of what the Bank is doing.â&#128;&#157; So he&#13;
did, and I forgot who the Executive Director was [Claus Knetschke] because it didnâ&#128;&#153;t last longer&#13;
than ten minutesâ&#128;&#148;the discussionâ&#128;&#148;and he sent me to a German-Brazilian colleague . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: If you tell me the year, I can find out.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: It must have been â&#128;&#153;75. And then I went down to a colleague, which had become a&#13;
friend by now, Caio [K.] Koch-Weser.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who became quite senior in the Bank later on.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Right. And Caio had just joined the Office of Environmental and Health Affairs with&#13;
Jim [James A.] Lee, who was absent at the time that I was there.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who was the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s first environmental officer.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Who was the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s first environmental officer. So we chatted a bit about that, and&#13;
Caio said, â&#128;&#156;By the way, we still need a public health physician in this unit. We have two&#13;
economists, but no public health character around. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a Population Projects Department&#13;
around with Kandiah Kanagaratnamâ&#128;&#148;called K.K.â&#128;&#148;but no public health person around here.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Oh,â&#128;&#157; I said, â&#128;&#156;it would be interesting,â&#128;&#157; but I was employed by the Federal Ministry of Health.&#13;
&#13;
He said, â&#128;&#156;Why donâ&#128;&#153;t you send me a CV,â&#128;&#157; or something like this.&#13;
&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#156;Sure. I will do that.â&#128;&#157; I did send that, and then a couple of months later on I went back to&#13;
Germany because Harvard had finished. Iâ&#128;&#153;d started the job again in the ministry. I think it was&#13;
five or six days after Iâ&#128;&#153;d started when an offer from the Bank arrived to come for an interview. It&#13;
said I should come for the interview, but it had as well attached a potential salary, so the offer&#13;
looked serious. So I went back to the States, went through the interview and accepted the job.&#13;
And then, six weeks later, I moved over to the States, stayed with some friend initially, and&#13;
started as assistant for public health in Jim Leeâ&#128;&#153;s Office of Environmental and Health Affairs.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: After several years of informal activity in the health sector, the Bank adopted a&#13;
formal health policy in 1974 that limited its operations in this sector to the financing of health&#13;
components of projects in other sectors. In 1975, a Bank health sector policy paper suggested&#13;
that poor health facilities were impeding development in many countries and that the&#13;
improvement of health conditions should become a major development objective. Subsequently,&#13;
the Bank increased its activities in the health sector, and between 1976 and 1978 it supported&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
health components amounting to $405 million in 70 projects in 44 countries. This marks a&#13;
significant and rapid increase in a major new area of Bank activity.&#13;
&#13;
By 1976 you were, as you have just said, assistant for public health in the Office of the Vice&#13;
President, Operations Policy. What was your role in this increased activity in the health sector?&#13;
Now, this started before you came aboard, but it was ongoing when you came, so . . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: When I came to the office, there were two colleagues, Caio Koch-Weser and Fred&#13;
[Fredrick] Golladay. And Fred was the economist. And Fred had been, basically, the author of&#13;
the previous 1975 health policy paper, which in a way was setting the stage for free-standing&#13;
health lending but then was aborted at the end, it was said due to pressure by USAID [United&#13;
States Agency for International Development], [Robert S.] McNamara caved in somewhere to&#13;
U.S. pressure. That wasâ&#128;&#148;that was gossip or whatever, but that was the reason which was traded&#13;
around, so there was a kind of disappointment.&#13;
&#13;
And there are a number of water resource development projects which had schistosomiasis&#13;
components, and Jim Lee was involved in some of these. Fred had been working on them as&#13;
well, but the number of components was relatively limited. Well, the three of us got together and&#13;
established what we called the "tickler system." We monitored all projects which could&#13;
potentially have health impactsâ&#128;&#148;right? And we called the project officers and talked with them.&#13;
We split the work amongst the three of us. I have to say Fred did more the research part of it, but&#13;
Caio and myself, we were the ones who did the operations work. And the result was an almost&#13;
explosive demand for assistance from the Office of Environmental and Health Affairs.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So you werenâ&#128;&#153;t viewed as interfering in the projects; quite the contrary.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Quite the contrary. Quite the contrary. I could have worked full-time for the East Asia&#13;
and Pacific Region Irrigation Division under Amnon Golan because we were appraising one&#13;
project after the other one in the Philippines. I worked on Cameroon. I worked on Bolivia, and I&#13;
then started on Brazil; Bob [Robert F.] Skillings was a programs division chief [Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean Region Programs Division 2A - Brazil], so there was a tremendous demand&#13;
for basic health activities in integrated development programsâ&#128;&#148;Ã  la Cameroon ZAPI [Zones&#13;
d'Actions Prioritaires Integrees]â&#128;&#148;in water resource development programs, small dams,&#13;
medium-sized dams, big dams projects (Sobradinho in Brazil), in an agriculture development&#13;
project which had health components, particularly the provision of health personnel. Also for the&#13;
Brazil Northeast Regional Development Projectsâ&#128;&#148;Peter Greening was the chiefâ&#128;&#148;there was an&#13;
enormous demand. So big was the demand that my wife actually complained that I was&#13;
constantly on the road working with these folks.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So you would actually go out to the projects . . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: To the projects. I was working on the projects, writing the section for the appraisal&#13;
reportsâ&#128;&#148;right?â&#128;&#148;and the cost tables. It was a fantastic introduction to the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s operational&#13;
work. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t think of anything better. And I have to say the colleagues with whom I had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
been working in East Asiaâ&#128;&#148;Amnon Golan and [Enzo George] Giglioli, some of these folks have&#13;
beenâ&#128;&#148;or Eldon [E.] Senner in Latin Americaâ&#128;&#148;absolutely superb because in no time did we get&#13;
it, the bread and butter rules of the Bank, indoctrinated: what procurement is, how you deal with&#13;
it, et cetera. You had people around you who really showed you. So I think Caio and myself&#13;
learned the ropes very, very rapidly, very, very rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
Since I was interested in the operational work, later on I had an enormous work program in terms&#13;
of looking after different components, but it was highly interesting, highly interesting. And I&#13;
believe that these components really had an impact because they provided health services as part&#13;
of project activities and that they were only components is immaterial, in my view. So we went&#13;
very, very heavily into the health sector, very heavily, but not in a controlling way, in an&#13;
operations support way.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: A supplementary way, in a sense?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes. The result was thatâ&#128;&#148;and I mean Caio can speak to that--but a result was that one&#13;
got an enormously broad support network in the Bank across the Regions. I worked the&#13;
transmigration projects, and I worked in Papua New Guinea on road projects and so on. Across&#13;
the Regions within two and a half or three years one knew a lot of people, a lot of people, and I&#13;
worked with a lot of people. I worked in Afghanistan . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure that facilitated a lot of your work later also.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yeah, because you could always call old friends. That is because the old boy&#13;
network, which was an informal network in the Bank, is so important.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And, parenthetically, under current Bank personnel policies, this sort of thing is&#13;
very hard to establish because of the shorter-term nature of most tenures in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, very true, very true. I think theâ&#128;&#148;I partly believe that this network of the old Bank&#13;
had tremendous advantages. I fail to see today that this introduced a lot of rigidity. I have really&#13;
not seen that. I felt that there was an enormous exchange of information on an informal level&#13;
which guarantees a certain quality of work. You were reallyâ&#128;&#148;I mean, there was no question that&#13;
if the work was not up to snuff. You know Amnon Golan, right?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: So if that was not first rate work, you got nowhere, so you better make sure that it&#13;
wasâ&#128;&#148;any Tâ&#128;&#153;s crossed and, you know, that everything was . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Iâ&#128;&#153;s dotted?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Iâ&#128;&#153;s dotted, yes.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Health Sector Policy Paper of February 1980 notes that during&#13;
this early period from 1975 through June 1978, the Bank provided technical and financial&#13;
assistance to 44 countries for 70 health components of projects in other sectors. In addition, the&#13;
Bank prepared seven health sector studies and conducted several population sector studies. This,&#13;
I imagine, would have provided the Bank with a considerable body of experience in working&#13;
with the health sector, as weâ&#128;&#153;ve just talked about. You were in the office of the Vice President,&#13;
Operations Policy for most of that period dealing with public health and thus would have had a&#13;
good view of these activities. What, in your view, were the major lessons learned by the Bank in&#13;
this early stage of involvement in the health sector?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, I recall that Pieter [P.] Bottelier came one day and said about Indonesia, â&#128;&#156;It&#13;
would be good if we would really understand a little bit more how the health sector functions.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
There was no health sector study, so we did a health sector . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: In Indonesia. We did a health sector overview [Report No. 2379-IND, Indonesia&#13;
Health Sector Overview, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, February 20, 1979], hired a&#13;
consultant who helped us, Manny [E.] Voulgaropoulos, who had been living there for several&#13;
years. So we got a very good understanding of how the sector had evolved, what traditionally&#13;
had been happening in the policy arena, what the institutional issues had been. Later on, when I&#13;
worked in Indonesia to develop the first health project, this helped tremendously.&#13;
&#13;
So one of the lessons was that in order to work with governments meaningfully in the medium&#13;
term, one would have to have a very decent understanding of the sector, whether you call that a&#13;
health sector strategy or whether you call that the health sector policies, but one needs to do&#13;
oneâ&#128;&#153;s analytical homework before one really starts working on strategic issue or policy initiatives&#13;
with government. That was something which came very clearly across.&#13;
&#13;
John [R.] Evans, first director of the Population, Health and Nutrition Department, said later,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;The component work is like sand castles which can be swept away,â&#128;&#157; which is wrong. The&#13;
component work wasnâ&#128;&#153;t like sand castles. What he, however, wanted to articulate, really, a little&#13;
bit beyond the point, was that it would be very useful to have an underpinning to understand in&#13;
what context these components occurred and in what context any kind of health activities had to&#13;
be anchored.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, by demand, you mean from the borrowing countries?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: From the borrowing countries. I was unclear why the Bank was insisting on "only"&#13;
components.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, that was an issue that Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to bring up in the next question, too.&#13;
Basically, McNamara hesitated to involve the Bank in lending in the health sector, and his&#13;
objection, from what I understand, was certainlyâ&#128;&#148;was not a question of suitability for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and not of policy for the borrowers, since he advocated health along with nutrition spending in&#13;
speeches at Columbia University in 1970 and the Annual Meeting in 1972. What might have&#13;
convinced him to get more involved in the health sector? Iâ&#128;&#153;m gathering that what youâ&#128;&#153;re saying&#13;
is the demand for this from the clients was probably part of the reason for this.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I think there were two reasons: one, that the demand of the clients had been strong,&#13;
because if youâ&#128;&#153;re working in so many countries, the message came from all corners: â&#128;&#156;Why canâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
we finance something in health?â&#128;&#157; And thatâ&#128;&#153;sâ&#128;&#148;McNamara was a very, as you very well know, a&#13;
very strong advocate of population control measures.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Notre Dame speech in . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yeah, he was portrayed . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: . . the early â&#128;&#152;70s.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: And at that time, I think the pendulum started to swing from fertility reduction policies&#13;
more toward the other side, because it was seen that in order to entice the mother to have fewer&#13;
children, it might be useful to provide health service for the living children; in other words, what&#13;
you expect the probability of survival for your individual childrenâ&#128;&#148;whether you have five or&#13;
three or sevenâ&#128;&#148;is.&#13;
&#13;
So the importance of health status and health services provision as a major determinant of&#13;
fertility emerged at this time. Before that, there was reallyâ&#128;&#148;it was almost cutâ&#128;&#148;right? Family&#13;
planning was seen almost as a mechanistic process that people donâ&#128;&#153;t multiply, full stop. But that&#13;
motherâ&#128;&#153;s education had something to do with survival of the child, et cetera, all the intricacies&#13;
which really lead to a better fertility profile, that wasnâ&#128;&#153;t much talked about. So the pendulum&#13;
was swinging back again. And keep in mind that WHO [World Health Organization] jointly&#13;
with UNICEF [United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund] had taken a very strong position on primary&#13;
health care in 1978.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which weâ&#128;&#153;re going to get into, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yeah. So the international environment changed, and I think McNamaraâ&#128;&#148;slow, slow,&#13;
very slowâ&#128;&#148;had to give in and accept the change. Fred Golladay and myself wrote the health&#13;
policy paper [Golladay, Fredrick, and Bernhard Liese, Health Problems and Policies in the&#13;
Developing Countries. World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 412. August 1980]. Fred was the&#13;
major author and I was the reviewer, though I would say Fred did 60 percent and I did 40&#13;
percent. But that isnâ&#128;&#153;t the point; the point was that we had to produce about 30 versions of that&#13;
thing.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Different iterations before it was published?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yeah. And it wasâ&#128;&#148;it was such a forceps delivery, such a forceps delivery. It was not&#13;
the writing. It was not the writing. It was the insecurity of the management to move that paper&#13;
ahead. It was . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGER: What were the major points of controversy there, or hesitation, on managementâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
part?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Itâ&#128;&#153;s still unclear to me. It was just the anxiety that it would be shot down again by&#13;
senior management. Herman [G.] van der Tak was basically managing the program under&#13;
Warren [C.] Baumâ&#128;&#153;s office, and he gave a lot of good ideas, and then we incorporated them. We&#13;
had the material from Alma-Ata, and we had very good contact with the WHO. So I think the&#13;
case story hasnâ&#128;&#153;t substantially changed, but the paper went through these iterations. I tell that&#13;
because it is an interesting feature. And then we came to the end. We had almost 30 drafts we&#13;
had gone through since we had first submitted it. The draft then went from Warren Baum to&#13;
Ernie [Ernest] Stern. And I have to hand it to Ernie; it came back marked up left, right and&#13;
center with mark upsâ&#128;&#148;right? We called them â&#128;&#156;Stern-o-gramsâ&#128;&#157; at the time, but these were&#13;
substantive, critical, really interesting comments. So we went back to Ernie, discussed it with&#13;
him, made these changes, and Ernie said, â&#128;&#156;Now we can survive.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I think it was the anxiety more of Warren Baumâ&#128;&#153;s shop to move it ahead because, in terms of the&#13;
internal politics of the Bank, there was a big Population Projects Department under&#13;
Kanagaratnam which was basically staffed by demographers, and then there was a small&#13;
nutrition advisory unit, which you might recall where Alan [D.] Berg and Emmerich [M.]&#13;
Schebeck were working from, and they initially were sitting somewhere in Urban Projects or&#13;
related to urban programs, urban projects. And the population group looked at health very&#13;
cautiously because the emergence of a health sector, to a certain extent, if you looked at the&#13;
external environment, was somehow a threat to their existence, because they were a fortress of&#13;
what I would call traditional thinking. So the relationship between the Office of Environmental&#13;
and Health Affairs and the Population Projects Department was obviously very tense.&#13;
&#13;
It has to be said, however, that Dr. Kanagaratnamâ&#128;&#148;K.K.â&#128;&#148; wasnâ&#128;&#153;t this traditional kind of&#13;
creature. He had a much more balanced view, and consequently I personally got along very well&#13;
with K.K., very well. We actually became friends. And K.K. and myself went to Alma-Ata. It&#13;
was a wonderful trip.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Weâ&#128;&#153;ll be getting into that also. Very interesting, I suspect.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Soâ&#128;&#148;but it was there. It was there.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I didnâ&#128;&#153;t want toâ&#128;&#148;we kind of switched into this matter of McNamara involving the&#13;
Bank in lending the health sector, and quite rightly, but I didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to leave quite yet the&#13;
question of major lessons learned. Was there anything else in terms of major lessons that youâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
care to add . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                          Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                 April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: . . or you felt that thatâ&#128;&#153;s well covered? Okay.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Annual Report of 1980 notes on page 71 that the Bank adopted in 1974 â&#128;&#156;a&#13;
formal health policy that limited its operations in the sector to financing health components of&#13;
projects in other sectors. That policy reflected the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s concern about the feasibility of&#13;
financing low-cost healthcare systems and its uncertainty about its proper roleâ&#128;&#148;how, in other&#13;
words, its activities would relate to those of the World Health Organization.â&#128;&#157; How were these&#13;
issues ultimately resolved? Now, you did mention interrelations with WHO and other such&#13;
entities.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And what was your role in establishing the relationships, also? We might as well&#13;
continue that on.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Theâ&#128;&#148;it was a kind of paradox relationship between the Bank and WHO, because our&#13;
real only operational program with WHOâ&#128;&#148;large-scale operational programâ&#128;&#148;was the oncho&#13;
program [Onchocerciasis Control Program]. When I came to the office, Jim Lee gave me this&#13;
dossier and said, you know, â&#128;&#156;Look at this one. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the oncho program.â&#128;&#157; That was managed&#13;
out of the Africa Region.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the riverblindness program?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The riverblindness program that McNamara had started. And that was a large&#13;
partnership, with WHO as the executing agency.&#13;
&#13;
The second area of importance in interacting with WHO was that Jim Lee had taken it upon&#13;
himself to follow up on a program which was emerging at that time, which was a tropical&#13;
diseases research and training program commonly referred to as TDR [Special Programme for&#13;
Research and Training in Tropical Diseases], and there was a lot of discussion between UNDP&#13;
[United Nations Development Programme], Jim Lee, the Bank, and WHO how that program&#13;
could be structured. It finally was created in â&#128;&#153;78, or â&#128;&#152;77.&#13;
&#13;
Then there was also a lot of discussion on diarrheal diseases, on a program of diarrheal diseases&#13;
control. So Jim Lee and the office had actually done a lot of work with WHO. He has to be&#13;
given credit for that. He knew a lot of people in WHO, and he was very active in the formative&#13;
arrangements of some of the subsequent big special health programs. So the Bank was in with it.&#13;
&#13;
There was anxiety on the part of WHO that the Bank would somehow take over its business.&#13;
That anxiety had not been unfounded, as we have seen later. On the part of the Bank there was&#13;
not really clarity of what its role would be. The notion that the Bank would be largely a source&#13;
of health sector finance for the countries, that was not seen that clearly at the time. It wasâ&#128;&#148;sure,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that we would be financing projects, but that that would become such a massive infusion of&#13;
money into the health sector, which later happened, that wasnâ&#128;&#153;t foreseen. This had to do with the&#13;
fact that in the late â&#128;&#152;70s many of theâ&#128;&#148;if you look at Africa, the African countries were largely&#13;
self-sufficient. The oil shock came a couple of years later.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Nineteen seventy-nine.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Nineteen seventy-nine. Then, suddenly, the pendulum started to swing around. The&#13;
need for massive inflows of resources, of financial resources as we saw it five years later, that&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t seen at that time. And the working relationship between WHO along many of these&#13;
programs were actually very good, soâ&#128;&#148;and I think there I did help because Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always had very&#13;
good relationships with WHO, was sitting on all kinds of committees, working groups and so on,&#13;
and tried to make it as easy as possible for WHO, so trying not to play the banker which had the&#13;
money in the pocket.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the 1970â&#128;&#153;s the concept of primary health care sponsored largely by the World&#13;
Health Organization and the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund, which we have already mentioned&#13;
briefly, began to evolve. As I understand it, it was seen that the widespread provision of basic&#13;
preventive and curative medical services is essential, but the concept of primary health care went&#13;
on to tackle the broader causes of health problems, as well as administrative, political and other&#13;
implementation problems. It is seen as an integrated approach to health that also encompasses&#13;
food production, education, water and sanitation and emphasizes self-reliance and partnership&#13;
between communities and government. Please discuss the evolution of the concept of primary&#13;
health care and your role in this evolution.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Primary health care emerged, basically, when Halfdan Mahler almost single-handedly&#13;
decided that the World Health . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And he was head of . . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The WHOâ&#128;&#148;that WHO should no longer be the technical advisory entity it had been&#13;
for the previous decade. Dr. [Marcolino Gomes] Candau, who preceded Mahler, if I would build&#13;
him a pedestal, one would write on it, "He created one of the foremost professionally competent&#13;
organizations." You had people who knew everything about all diseases in Geneva and had&#13;
certain regulatory functions, like international health regulations and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Mahler changed the outlook of the organization completely. He basically moved it towards a&#13;
social justice concept, where he looked in a very different direction. He gave it a developmental&#13;
outlook. He gave it a new direction. WHO was a "technologically perfect organization," but&#13;
now it had to adopt a developmental outlook. This perspective was not built on a market&#13;
concept, as Mahler would say; it was built on basically equitable exercises to basic health&#13;
services. And in order to do that, he brought in a lot of systems people, et cetera. So the&#13;
organization doubled in size. WHO changed its focus dramatically, really, really dramatically,&#13;
and this change of focus in the organization engendered a lot of resistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Within the organization, or externally?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Within the organization and externally. Actually, UNICEF was brought in to help out.&#13;
The joint UNICEF and WHO commission set up with WHO assistant director-general Kenneth&#13;
Newellâ&#128;&#148;a New Zealanderâ&#128;&#148;as the chairperson. They prepared the Alma-Ata conference. I&#13;
personally have not been involved in the preparation of the Alma-Ata conference. I went to&#13;
WHO for a couple of meetings, but I would say that my input was marginal on that point.&#13;
&#13;
What I did, however, is I briefed the Bank, or our own office, on what was happening on the&#13;
other side. Maybe my function was more to be a transmitter of information to the home front&#13;
because initially the idea wasnâ&#128;&#153;t really whether it was necessary for us to go to Alma-Ataâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
should we, should we not go to Russia. Actually, it was extraordinarily important to go there.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, that had to doâ&#128;&#148;thatâ&#128;&#153;s an important aspect of this evolution of the concept of&#13;
primary health care, correct?&#13;
&#13;
Let me just put that in context for the purpose of this conversation. This was an international&#13;
conference on primary health care convened by WHO in the capital of what is now Kazakhstan&#13;
in September 1978, where the worldâ&#128;&#153;s nations agreed that health was far more than the absence&#13;
of disease, that it was an inalienable right, that urgent action was needed to tackle health&#13;
inequities between and within countries, and that primary care was the key to achieving health&#13;
for all. The Declaration of Alma-Ata adopted at that conference stated in part, â&#128;&#156;A main social&#13;
target of governments, international organizations, and the whole world community in the&#13;
coming decades should be the attainment by all peoples of the world by the year 2000 of a level&#13;
of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life. Primary&#13;
health care is the key to attaining this target as part of the development in the spirit of social&#13;
justice.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Now, you were just saying how this head of the World Health Organization had changed the&#13;
focus of the organization to social, the issue of social justice.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So, I wanted to put that in context for the continuation of this very good discussion&#13;
on the evolution of primary health care, and now we can discuss the Alma-Ata conference.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The Alma-Ata conference was very important because it became very clear that the&#13;
concept of primary health was widely shared. Even in the U.S., where social justice wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be&#13;
the primary driver of national politicsâ&#128;&#148;at least not as far as I have observedâ&#128;&#148;the notion of&#13;
primary health care went down initially rather well, and later on USAID financed something like&#13;
60 primary health care projects, evaluated them, and found that many of them didnâ&#128;&#153;t work.&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#153;s an issue, but initially it went down well, andâ&#128;&#148;but it was very, very clear that this was a&#13;
concept which was widely accepted, so in terms of looking at our clients, if we were active in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
health sector and we wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have subscribed to the notion of primary health care, we would&#13;
have been an outlier. We would have not been accepted.&#13;
&#13;
It was very useful to be there during the conference. We had lots of discussions. K.K. met with&#13;
many delegations, and it was a very nice environment. We made a statement, the topic of which&#13;
was potential operational issues in primary health care, in which we pointed out that the&#13;
institutional challenges of operationalizing primary health care would be the major issue, which&#13;
turned out to be correct later on. And I think we said that based on the experience, (a) of Dr.&#13;
Kanagaratnam had with the population project, and (b) what we in the health office had seen&#13;
with our component work. So we felt that the critical issues in making actually health systems&#13;
work were of an institutional nature rather than of a financial nature or a policy directive, et&#13;
cetera, so we articulated that quite clearly in a statement to the conference. It might be in the&#13;
conference proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I want to stop just right there because we have to change the tape. Sorry.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
ZIEGLER: We were talking about the Declaration of Alma-Ata and its importance in the&#13;
evolution of the concept of primary health care. Please continue.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The conference was actually in that sense very important because it showed to the two&#13;
of us very clearlyâ&#128;&#148;and we related that to senior managementâ&#128;&#148;that we either be part of primary&#13;
health care or we would not be not active in the health sector. Since we were at the time not&#13;
active in the health sector, Alma-Ata very clearly was the major driver to get us moving with the&#13;
health sector.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which we talked about earlier, the 1980 paper.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The 1980 paper. We started work immediately. We had already started the preparation&#13;
of the paper, but then we pushed it ahead.&#13;
&#13;
The issues which emerged with primary health care later on had more to do with the operational&#13;
issues, the notion that you had this "low-cost kind of animal," the village health worker, which&#13;
could do everything . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The barefoot doctors in China, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The barefoot doctor. These concepts turned out to be rather illusions. Whatâ&#128;&#148;nowhere&#13;
in the primary health care paper was said that China had the barefoot doctors, but parallel to it, it&#13;
had a system of anti-epidemic stations based on a very, very well-organized functioning public&#13;
health system which dealt with the big diseases and epidemics, like shistosomiasis, et cetera. It&#13;
was somehow put aside on the primary health care discussion because the focus was on social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                   April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
justice issues, so some of these things later on popped up. But Alma-Ata had an enormous&#13;
impact on the Bank, no doubt about that.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The effect was also more widespread than just the Bank, of course.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yeah. It changed.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: It had to do internationally.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Internationally it changed the field. But just to give an anecdote of how McNamara&#13;
looked at it, we had a discussion with McNamara when we came back, he and myself, and he&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;Well, yeah, primary health care is very important, very important, and we support that.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
Mahler had in the same context coined the notion â&#128;&#156;health for all,â&#128;&#157; and McNamara, bright as he&#13;
is, said immediately, â&#128;&#156;Well, what he really wanted to say is not â&#128;&#152;health for allâ&#128;&#153;; itâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;different&#13;
diseases for all by the year 2000.â&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#157; So you saw this inquisitive kind of analytic mind of&#13;
McNamara looking at the sector. We had actually to chuckle. He was so correct.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In July 1979â&#128;&#148;this is after the Alma-Ata conferenceâ&#128;&#148;the Executive Directors&#13;
reviewed the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s experience in financing health components and approved a proposal to&#13;
expand its program to provide, in addition to financing such components, direct lending for&#13;
health projects. The Executive Directors agreed that emphasis should be placed on providing&#13;
primary health care to treat common, simple ailments, on preventive care instead of curative&#13;
medicine, on low-cost technologies in place of sophisticated hospitals and equipment, and on&#13;
community participation in health care systems. This obviously is the direction urged by the&#13;
Alma-Ata Declaration. Did it prove controversial at the Board level?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: No, no, on the contrary. I mean, there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a single voice that said something&#13;
negative. It sailed through wonderfully.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which is not always the case in these matters, but thatâ&#128;&#153;s . . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: No, I mean, there was no opposition. There were questions, but it sailed through&#13;
wonderfully, as it had been something which was overdue.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were the co-author of an August 1980 staff working paper No. 412, Health&#13;
Issues and Policies in the Developing Countries: A Background Study for World Development&#13;
Report 1980. On page 30, the paper states: â&#128;&#156;The primary health care movement has developed a&#13;
broad professional and bureaucratic constituency for accessible low-cost health care. The&#13;
resistance to simplifying health care technologies seen earlier among the health professions and&#13;
health bureaucracies has been neutralized and, in some instances, reversed. Moreover, the very&#13;
vigorous support of WHO and UNICEF has given the movement professional legitimacy. The&#13;
major accomplishment to date has been to influence the politics of health in the direction of&#13;
greater social justice, rather than merely to produce a call for greater budget allocations of&#13;
additional external assistance to the sector. However, the task of translating the principles of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
primary health care into workable programs of training and service delivery has only begun.&#13;
Almost no effort has been spent on developing strategic programs for implementing desirable&#13;
change.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Earlier, of course, weâ&#128;&#153;ve touched on the question of the evolution of primary health care and the&#13;
concept thereof. On a more specific level, what has happened since 1980 to develop what your&#13;
paper called â&#128;&#156;the strategic programs for implementing desirable changeâ&#128;&#157;?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, it became very clear that when one started to look at "local health services," that&#13;
the idea was well articulated but how to operationalize that idea was quite a different story, and&#13;
we had made that point earlier. Paul Isenman asked us to write the background paper for the&#13;
WDR [World Development Report] 1980. The World Development Report addressed poverty&#13;
every decade. We made the case very clearly that the major contribution of the Bank in the area&#13;
of primary health care would not be primarily the funding of it. It was an important element, but&#13;
the institutional knowledge, how one could operationalize primary health care in terms of&#13;
institutional actors, management processes, quality controls, supervision, et ceteraâ&#128;&#148;what you&#13;
call public administrationâ&#128;&#148;that on some of these issues the Bank could actually be helpful. It&#13;
turned out later that this actually is one of the major contributions of the Bank in a sector like&#13;
health.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, in the United States here, a school of thought emerged under the Rockefeller&#13;
Foundation with Ken [Kenneth S.] Warren, whom I knew very well at the time, as the director of&#13;
the Health Section of the Rockefeller Foundation, who advocated an approach which was called&#13;
"selective primary health care." He wrote a paper with Julia Walsh which is still one of the&#13;
seminal papers in the health sector. He basically said, â&#128;&#156;It is almost impossible to focus on a&#13;
horizontal health system and improve that gradually everywhere. You need to focus on&#13;
something which is measurable, which is doable, which is feasible,â&#128;&#157; and so he looked at selective&#13;
areas of the health sector, particular disease control programs, and said, â&#128;&#156;Why donâ&#128;&#153;t you move&#13;
these ones ahead first? They will basically empower the health system.â&#128;&#157; That philosophy has&#13;
caught on and still exists. Itâ&#128;&#153;s only in the last year that the pendulum is swinging back more&#13;
towards the notion of health systems development. The recent policy paper of the Bank looks&#13;
more at health systems development [Healthy Development: The World Bank Strategy for&#13;
Health, Nutrition, and Population Results. April 24, 2007].&#13;
&#13;
What subsequently happened was that for almost three decades â&#128;&#156;selective approaches,â&#128;&#157; particular&#13;
disease control programs, have been taking off rapidly. They have been extraordinarily&#13;
successful, but the accusation has been that they are vertical, that they are sitting in the overall&#13;
health system like a â&#128;&#156;foreign body,â&#128;&#157; which is not entirely correct. So the notion about vertical&#13;
and horizontal, between integrated and vertical, has been assuming an importance which it really&#13;
doesnâ&#128;&#153;t deserve because what we are talking about are really categorical interventions, which in&#13;
some areas are integrated; in other situations they are not integrated.&#13;
&#13;
In the Bank, we were sitting somewhere on the fence on this discussion. We were sitting&#13;
between WHO and the Rockefeller Foundation. And what was our role? Our role was basically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to keep the communication open on both sides. And actually, more and more people then looked&#13;
toward the Bank as if we would have something to offer, which we didnâ&#128;&#153;t have at that time--I&#13;
mean in terms of articulated knowledge based on real experience.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: To cope with the expanded activities in the health sector, a new Population, Health,&#13;
and Nutrition Department was established in October 1979 in the Central Projects Staff by&#13;
combining the staff working in the fields of health, nutrition, and family planning. You became&#13;
the deputy chief of one of the divisions in that department. What was your role in its&#13;
establishment? And Iâ&#128;&#153;m talking about itâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;m talking about bureaucratically, rather than health&#13;
policy as such.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, we wereâ&#128;&#148;had been sitting around the table and trying to figure out how to go&#13;
ahead. Since I was the one from the health sector, I was basically negotiating with the&#13;
Population Projects Department how a health department or unit could be established, and then&#13;
the staffing. We then selected a director, John Evans, who came from Canada, a wonderful man,&#13;
intelligent and a highly charming personality. He came from an academic background, and that&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;tâ&#128;&#148;the Bank wasnâ&#128;&#153;t really his area, so he stayed only for a year and a half or two years. He&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t stay very long around here. The relationship between senior management didnâ&#128;&#153;t actually&#13;
work all that well, but very nice man, very competent man.&#13;
&#13;
And then, initially, the decisions were made, you know, who would be taking over what division,&#13;
and obviously the allocation of responsibility difficult. The old Population Projects Department&#13;
had to be accommodated, and it was Ishrat [Z.] Husain and Hal [Harold W.] Messenger who&#13;
became the division chiefs. I became the deputy division chief under Ishrat; these were huge&#13;
divisions. We had West Africa, East Asia, Latin America in our divisionâ&#128;&#148;half the worldâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
Ishrat and myself split it. I did Latin America because she didnâ&#128;&#153;t speak Spanish or Portuguese. I&#13;
did Latin America and East Asia largely, and Ishrat did West Africa, so we . . .&#13;
&#13;
The initial marching orders from John Evans were to do sector work, do sector work, do sector&#13;
work. Donâ&#128;&#153;t do components anymore. Stop all component work.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which had been initially very popular, from what you told me earlier on.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Right, right, and he really ruled that should be stopped. I believe this was a remarkable&#13;
mistake which he made because by doing so, we lost some of the contacts which we had. The&#13;
Population Department wasnâ&#128;&#153;t very popular in the Region. The population projects were not&#13;
seen positively; they were seen as imposed. So he, John Evans, basically tried to stop the&#13;
working relationship which we had due to components, which several of us felt was not&#13;
particularly wise. Nobody disputed the need to do proper sector work, but we could have played&#13;
on two pianos simultaneously operationally.&#13;
&#13;
Then we made a major effort to start the first project, which was in Tunisia, actually a lot of&#13;
discussion about it, how it should be done, and I thought at the time if we moved that slowly on a&#13;
single project, we will never get anything done.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                          Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                 April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I worked actually on a component, on a health component in Brazil, the Northwest Regional&#13;
Development Project, the famous . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which I think weâ&#128;&#153;re going to get into a little bit later, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: And so I said to Bob Skillings, â&#128;&#156;Well, Bob, why donâ&#128;&#153;t we make a project out of the&#13;
component? Why doesnâ&#128;&#153;t the department have a project? We have a $25 million component, or&#13;
we have a $25 million or $80 million project, so whatever.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Bob Skillings said, â&#128;&#156;Go ahead, make a project out of it, only package it properly. You have&#13;
relatively little time, however, to do so, because it needs to go into the overall package to the&#13;
Board.â&#128;&#157; So we developed the project.&#13;
&#13;
My point is that we could have used many of these component undertakings to really develop&#13;
project pipelinesâ&#128;&#148;which we later on didâ&#128;&#148;but I believe in the initial development of the&#13;
Population, Health, and Nutrition Department I believe there was a lack of operational&#13;
leadership. I have to say that frankly, although I dearly appreciate John Evans, but he didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
provide this kind of leadership drive. Operations were not his cup of tea. And it was when John&#13;
Evans had left, it was John D. North, who came from Operations, who basically brought that&#13;
dimension. Then things moved ahead.&#13;
&#13;
John Evans, however, did a number of things which I think were extraordinarily helpful for the&#13;
Bank. He established excellent relationships with WHO, particularly with respect to the TDR&#13;
programâ&#128;&#148;tropical disease researchâ&#128;&#148;in which we were a non-paying co-sponsor.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the German effort that you mentioned earlier on, am I right?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: No. This is the WHO-UNDP-World Bank program on training and research in tropical&#13;
diseases, one of the WHO flagship programs.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: We were a co-sponsor. Jim Lee started that, and John followed it up, and I dealt with it&#13;
later on for years and years as the Bank representative. But John insisted with Ernie Stern that&#13;
the Bank should make a financial contribution, and he really muscled it through against a lot of&#13;
opposition. He has to be given credit for that. It was quite an achievement. I mention that&#13;
because in many of these respects John Evans was excellent, only he should have had a deputy&#13;
who knew the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s machinery.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And he was more of an academic sort, as you say.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                   April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: According to the World Bank Annual Report of 1980, the new Population, Health,&#13;
and Nutrition Department was to start slowly, beginning with one health project in FY â&#128;&#153;81 and a&#13;
gradual expansion thereafter. However, by 1982 the World Bank had become the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest&#13;
lender for health projects in developing countries. What accounts for the rapid growth for Bank&#13;
lending in the health sector, given the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s initial reluctance to lend to that sector?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: It was simply the tremendous demand, and we became the largest lender simply&#13;
because there were so few other ones which were lending money to the health sector, so you&#13;
have to see that in perspective. The largest lender is actually almost an overstatement because,&#13;
as I said, by default we became the largest lender. But we then developed rapidly a number of&#13;
projects. There was demand. You could go wherever you wanted. There was demand.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were the task manager for a number of World Bank projects in the health&#13;
sector. Were there any particular experiences and lessons learned that you would like to place on&#13;
the record?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, the most important issue which I take away from years of work on the projects,&#13;
which I really loved dearly, was there ainâ&#128;&#153;t no success if you donâ&#128;&#153;t have a decent local&#13;
constituency for the program. In other words, there must be people who want it to succeed&#13;
locally. You need a political constituency. You cannot from the top, from the solid pedestal of&#13;
ignorance, dictate policies, which in other languages are called politics. The health sector is a&#13;
living organism, and in that senseâ&#128;&#148;and itâ&#128;&#153;s culture-specific. Itâ&#128;&#153;s driven by the cultures and&#13;
values, the political climate in a country, so you need to have to consider that. That has been one&#13;
of the big shortcomings, in my view, of the Bank, that we felt that this was immaterial because&#13;
we had a technological approach or an economically well-founded perspective on something.&#13;
Well, it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t work that way. Why do we have guns in the United States? It makes no sense to&#13;
a German. And why are there no speed limits on the Autobahn in Germany? It makes no sense&#13;
to an American, but these are the facts.&#13;
&#13;
So the importance of creating these constituencies were often underestimated. They were&#13;
particularly quite often underestimated in the population projects portfolio. In countries where&#13;
they had a huge constituency, a local constituency like Indonesia, they worked. In other&#13;
countries like in India, this was a different story. Or Jamaica.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What accounts for the difference there between, say, Indonesia on one hand, and&#13;
India and Jamaica on the other?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The idea of family planning was a marginal idea accepted by only part of the polity;&#13;
you found these issues over and over. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s one.&#13;
&#13;
The second one is that I often felt that money alone is really not the solution. Let me give an&#13;
example, because it is so classic. When we developed the Amazon Basin Malaria Control&#13;
Program, $100-something million, the Brazilian government had these so-called â&#128;&#156;Polo fundsâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;&#13;
Polonoreste and Poloamazoniâ&#128;&#148;which were local development funds, tons of money sitting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
unused. So, why, I asked Molartâ&#128;&#148;hero of the National Planning Agencyâ&#128;&#148;I said, â&#128;&#156;Molart, why&#13;
do you want the Bank to borrow over $100 million for this project?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
He said, â&#128;&#156;Itâ&#128;&#153;s very clear you need a stable entity which obliges us to perform; in other words, we&#13;
need to de-politicize the development process.â&#128;&#157; Funds for malaria are now guaranteed for the&#13;
next five years. Money from malaria will be used by one particular portfolio with one particular&#13;
institution, SUCAM [Superintendencia de Companhas de SaÃºde PÃºblica - Superintendency for&#13;
Public Health Campaigns]. So the Bank acts almost like an insurance mechanism for the&#13;
national program. Very important.&#13;
&#13;
The sad part is that the institutional issues are often overlooked. Attention to the institutional&#13;
issues in implementation are paramount because institutional issues, particularly in the health&#13;
sector, often are really micro-political issues. One better understands them and tries to maneuver&#13;
around them because otherwise they can become very big impediments in terms of&#13;
implementation, resulting in poor-performing projects.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were there any individuals whose particular contributions in the evolution of the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s health sector policy whom youâ&#128;&#153;d care to mention? You mentioned Mr. Kanagaratnam&#13;
and Mr. Evans. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if you want to elaborate on any of that.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yeah. I think Fred Golloday deserves a lot of credit because he has done a lot of&#13;
homework, legwork on the policy paper, and then we hired somebody from CINDER [Centro de&#13;
Investigaciones Multidisciplinarias en Desarrollo Rural], a research project in Colombia; Oscar&#13;
Echeverri was actually the first rural health specialist. There were a number of other colleagues&#13;
who really worked to operationalize thingsâ&#128;&#148;Larry [Lawrence] Casazza.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Kanagaratnam was kind of a pioneer in a way in the population area in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yeah, yeah. K.K. was a pioneer in that area, as was Alan Berg on the nutrition side.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, yes. He had a seminal paper, did he not, oh, 25 years ago, I guess it is now?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, and then later on Frederick [T.] Sai came as population adviser, so we had a&#13;
number of people who were really absolutely world class.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In February 1985 you became senior public health specialist in the Office of the&#13;
Director of the Population, Health, and Nutrition Department. What were the circumstances of&#13;
this change of assignment?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, theâ&#128;&#148;that was the time when the reorganization was coming, and the issue was&#13;
we needed to somehowâ&#128;&#148;as we were growing the portfolio, we needed to have somebody who&#13;
could hold hands on the operational side; that is, backstopping younger colleagues. It is funny,&#13;
but Jacques [F.] Baudouy, who has been the previous director of the Health Department in the&#13;
anchor, when he came to the Bank he didnâ&#128;&#153;t have much of an idea how projects were developed,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and so I was the one who worked with him through the first project, the Rwanda appraisal. I did&#13;
basically the same thing which people from the Operations side had done when I was coming to&#13;
the Bank: talk about procurement, finding out how things were done, how one would do an&#13;
appraisal report, how one would get it through the system. So I did a lot of what I would call&#13;
operations support, backstopping colleagues. And that was an interesting task, but not an easy&#13;
task; it was a training task, like a coach.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Mentoring, we call it today.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Mentoring, but it was as well very rewarding.&#13;
&#13;
And then the other areaâ&#128;&#148;since I came from the tropical diseases side, I looked after the tropical&#13;
disease portfolio, and I managed de facto the relationship with WHO. I was sitting on the task&#13;
force which dealt with generic drugs for the pharmaceutical industry, the CDD [Control of&#13;
Diarrhea and Respiratory Infections] Board; the ARI Board (acute respiratory infections), you&#13;
know, these different programs. I spent a lot of time on the WHO relationship.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In your new position you were responsible for developing the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s policies and&#13;
operational programs in tropical and water-related diseases. Please give examples of some of&#13;
this work. Now, what we were just talking about was the internal aspect. In this question Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
talking about the external.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yeah. So we had, for example, to develop guidelines for use of pesticides, to give one&#13;
example. That I did jointly with a colleague who developed the first series of guidelines for&#13;
development of pesticides, et cetera. So we did develop something which other outside people&#13;
could refer to, which was published material, which was very helpful.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In speaking along these lines, in the late 1980s the World Bank made a loan to&#13;
Brazil for the Amazon Basin Malaria Control Program to help the country to control a malaria&#13;
epidemic in that area. DDT was approved for use in this project, and the use of DDT is, of&#13;
course, a subject of considerable controversy even today. What is your take on that controversy?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, it was an interesting controversy, but a tempest in a teapot because even today&#13;
DDT is permitted as used selectively for public health purposes, and people have forgotten that&#13;
what we call the environmental negative runoff from intra-domiciliary house spraying is&#13;
minimal. Itâ&#128;&#153;s totally negligible. So we had actually a hundred tons of DDT in that malaria&#13;
control program.&#13;
&#13;
We discussed it with the Brazilian authorities. They had a task force to limit what the negative&#13;
environmental impact would be, but DDT was used in Brazil and is still partially used. But, as&#13;
could be predicted, the international NGOs [non-governmental organizations] were trying to&#13;
attack us, so I had to really stand up there and defend this decision over and over again. And Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
glad that the Bank took this position because we had similar situations with malaria control in&#13;
Madagascar, for example.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                 April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Today the pendulum is swinging back. WHO has just recommended DDT for . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve read that the idea of the total ban on DDT isâ&#128;&#148;thereâ&#128;&#153;s a lot of controversy&#13;
about it. As you rightly said, the pendulum is swinging back. The people are saying, â&#128;&#156;A lot of&#13;
people are dying of malaria, whereas if we used DDT, they wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have died of malaria.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yeah, and the environmentalâ&#128;&#148;if there would be a serious environmental impact, that&#13;
would be a different story, but the environmental impact came from the use of DDT for&#13;
agriculture purposes. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a very different issue. For example, in India, where DDT was used&#13;
by the Indian farmers for years and where there were still a lot of illegal sales to the agriculture&#13;
sector, that would be a different issue. Then I could agree with the environmentalists that one&#13;
would have to be very, very careful before one uses DDT. But in programs like Madagascar,&#13;
where they had acute epidemics of people really dying rapidly, there was no alternative but to&#13;
use DDT. That was the pesticide of choice.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And it worked?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: It worked. It surely works.&#13;
&#13;
We have over the years been replacing DDT wherever we could with other pesticides, and&#13;
initially with malathionâ&#128;&#148;but that stinksâ&#128;&#148;but the costs are higher and you see resistance&#13;
building up quickly. So I think the role for DDTâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;m glad that DDT is finally rehabilitated in&#13;
public health circles. It was not an easy stand to take, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But a scientifically correct one?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Probably a scientifically correct one.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Regarding the same project, the New Scientist magazine for August 12, 1989, notes,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Bernard Liese with the World Bank points out that in Brazil no one understood the intricate&#13;
factors contributing to the malaria epidemic in the Amazon until it had been going on for some&#13;
time. Disorderly development with many families moving in each day by any possible means of&#13;
transport made it difficult to evaluate what was going on. â&#128;&#152;Amazonia is really the Wild West, a&#13;
frontier,â&#128;&#153; he says.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
This sounds like a challenging situation. Could you please describe some of these challenges as&#13;
they relate to your involvement in this project and the means by which you set out to address&#13;
them? Now, DDT was, of course, one challenge, but clearly there were others here.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I went to the initial mission with Bob Skillings in which we looked at what could be&#13;
done in this area. You might recall that a road over a thousand kilometers long from Cuiaba to&#13;
Porto Velho existed, which was one of the few north-south axes which traversed the Amazon.&#13;
This road was largely unpaved, and it took about a week to go from pothole to pothole through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
there between Cuiaba to Porto Velho. It hadnâ&#128;&#153;t stopped farmers from the impoverished South to&#13;
sell everything and move into Amazonia, so when we went through that road from pothole to&#13;
pothole, there were lots of trucks and cars and people on that road, and they disappeared&#13;
somewhere, almost mysteriously, into the forest.&#13;
&#13;
What you saw thereâ&#128;&#148;which is called in Portuguese lineas, the little roads, feeder roads,&#13;
branching offâ&#128;&#148;first it was a kind of road, then it became a path, and then it disappeared. But&#13;
then you saw somewhere people had built houses on stilts. They often didnâ&#128;&#153;t have walls because&#13;
there were no sawmills, so you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t have boardsâ&#128;&#148;right? When you are flying over this area,&#13;
you notice that the forest was invaded like the moths are eating on a cloth.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Just holes in the forest canopy where people had set up squatter settlements?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Squatters, yeah. First they built the house, and then they moved in with the familyâ&#128;&#148;a&#13;
platform on stilts, with a roof, is a better descriptionâ&#128;&#148;and they planted initially banana trees, and&#13;
under the banana thereâ&#128;&#153;s a shadeâ&#128;&#148;as a shade tree, and then they planted coffee, because that was&#13;
what they knew from the South.&#13;
&#13;
It was very disorganized, totally disorganized. It was actually the Wild West. There were&#13;
constant kind of robberies and shootings andâ&#128;&#148;well, the biggest curse was malaria because the&#13;
people from the South were never exposed to malaria, and suddenly they went into a malarious&#13;
area. And it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t only the children who died, like in Africa, where mainly children died&#13;
because malaria immunity is well-established in this population. No, this was a non-immune&#13;
population moving into this area, and so the fathers suddenly died, and there was a mother with&#13;
three children, or three children alone because both parents had died; tragic situations, truly&#13;
tragic situations. And in addition, there were some Indian reservations, and the settlers moved&#13;
into these reservations.&#13;
&#13;
But the settlers were one group of people. There was another group of people which was even&#13;
more aggressive. These were the gold miners, garimperos, because thereâ&#128;&#153;s a lot of gold in this&#13;
area, so they reallyâ&#128;&#148;they were â&#128;&#156;washingâ&#128;&#157; wherever they could find it. The biggest was Sierra&#13;
Pelada, an enormous kind of operations, totally disorganized, no sign of government. The only&#13;
person who was from government was the health worker from SUCAM, the disease control&#13;
organization, so basicallyâ&#128;&#148;well, SUCAM served as the only responsible state official in that&#13;
area.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: No police or . . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: No police, nothing. Nothing. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve never seen such a mess, but it was one of the most&#13;
fascinating work which I have been doing.&#13;
&#13;
We went through these areas, but as we went back we said, â&#128;&#156;Something has to be done.â&#128;&#157; Well,&#13;
the Brazilian government had decided to pave the BR-354 road between Cuiaba and Porto&#13;
Velho. So they went ahead to do that, and we provided financial assistance for this road project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then we added on an agriculture support and settlement projectâ&#128;&#148;an agriculture project at&#13;
first; later on, it was redesigned with a small settlement component, and the third part was a&#13;
health project to deal with malaria control.&#13;
&#13;
As you know, the Bank got a very checkered reputation in Brazil, largely because we went out&#13;
beyond that portfolio of the three projects and engaged actively in settlement issues. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
where the problem occurred. The road construction project didnâ&#128;&#153;t do us any harm. The initial&#13;
agriculture rehab project didnâ&#128;&#153;t do much, but when we went into the settlement area, we went&#13;
right into the middle of the controversies of who should be there and who should not be there.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That was one of my questions. In fact, my next question was going to be about&#13;
how you would assess the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s role in Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s economic development in the period you were&#13;
involved in these projects, and this directly refers to those controversies.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Contrary to what the public opinion is, I think the Bank has done a very good job. If I&#13;
imagine . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Youâ&#128;&#153;re speaking of Brazil, specifically?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Brazil specifically, yeah. I only imagine what would have happened if the Bank would&#13;
not have been there. The national authorities had great difficulties to control the situation; not&#13;
that we were a police force, but at least we reported back what was happening. The Brazilian&#13;
government then had the data to take a position, so I think the Bank played a catalytic role. It&#13;
paid dearly for it. It paid dearly for it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: A lot of controversy over that.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: A lot of controversy over it, but several of us who worked on these projectsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
colleagues from various sectorsâ&#128;&#148;we all shared the same opinion, that it was good that the Bank&#13;
went in. The only thing which we would not do again, we would not really deal with settlement&#13;
issues per se. I think that was the area where we went into too much of a political controversy.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the article in the New Scientist that I mentioned, it also quoted Bruce Rich,&#13;
(whoâ&#128;&#153;s a well-known critic of the World Bank), the Environmental Defense Fund, as saying that&#13;
the World Bank has loaned hundreds of million dollars to Brazil for development of the Amazon&#13;
region and has â&#128;&#156;a direct responsibility for this disaster. For a country like Brazil, thatâ&#128;&#153;s a very&#13;
expensive way of standing still.â&#128;&#157; Now, clearly, you and your colleagues would have disagreed&#13;
with that assessment by Mr. Rich?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. As we were involved, as always, if you are in it, you are in it, so&#13;
surely I think the Bank has to shoulder its responsibility, but I would say that on the whole, I&#13;
would have been very much afraid if the Bank wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have been there. As you see, then, over&#13;
the years, the situation stabilized. It stabilized. Now, there is no objective evidence which can&#13;
be provided that we created a mess.&#13;

&#13;
ZIEGLER: Concerning?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Concerning whether that was a wise decision or not a wise decision.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Ah.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I have the picture of the initial mission through the area, and I have really never seen&#13;
something like this. Absolute chaos. Massive immigration, massive immigration. I think it&#13;
would be criminal to have said, â&#128;&#156;Oh, we canâ&#128;&#153;t do anything. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a Brazilian problem.â&#128;&#157; If you&#13;
are a development organization, then we should be involved in the matter.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, weâ&#128;&#153;ll be moving on to a different topic, so I think this would be a good place&#13;
to end this first session of the interview and take it up next time. Thank you, Dr. Liese.&#13;

&#13;
ZIEGLER: Today is April 17, 2008. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant with the World&#13;
Bank Group Oral History Program. I have with me here today in the Archives of the World&#13;
Bank Group Dr. Bernhard H. Liese, and we will be continuing his interview for the World Bank&#13;
Group Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
Bernard, last time we were discussing tropical diseases, and weâ&#128;&#153;ll take up that subject at this&#13;
point. You co-authored an article in the December 1993 issue of Finance and Development&#13;
entitled, â&#128;&#156;Organizing Tropical Disease Control.â&#128;&#157; The article states, â&#128;&#156;Relatively few governments&#13;
support major efforts to control tropical disease. The means, primarily drugs and insecticides, of&#13;
treating and controlling most of these diseases do exist, yet despite a major expansion of primary&#13;
healthcare in the 1980s, the burden of tropical diseases is increasing, and the prospects of&#13;
controlling the major diseasesâ&#128;&#148; malaria and schistosomiasisâ&#128;&#148; are worsening. The main area of&#13;
controversy over the past ten years revolves around the question of whether programs should be&#13;
â&#128;&#152;verticallyâ&#128;&#153; organized or â&#128;&#152;horizontallyâ&#128;&#153; integrated. In somewhat oversimplified terms, vertical is&#13;
hierarchical, technology-based, and â&#128;&#152;categorical,â&#128;&#153; that is, focused on specific diseases. In&#13;
contrast, horizontal integration is intertwined with primary care, community-based, and close to&#13;
the people.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
In the years since the article was written, what have you seen in terms of the question of vertical&#13;
versus horizontal integration for tropical disease control? And I think we did previously touch&#13;
on this issue of vertical versus horizontal but specifically here in terms of the tropical disease&#13;
control.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, the issue is still around. And it isâ&#128;&#148; there is really no true technical issue behind&#13;
vertical versus horizontal. This is almost a theological conversation about beliefs. Very often&#13;
disease control programs are categorically organized; that means around areas of specialization.&#13;
But they are decentralized for field operations. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re centralized for support functions. Those&#13;
are various ways in which these disease control programs are organized.&#13;
&#13;
But behind that is the schism in public health between what you would call the true primary&#13;
health care advocates and selective PHC advocates. The people believe that health systems are&#13;
cultural expressions, which they actually are, that they have functions of social justice embedded&#13;
in them, that the equity and quality issues are very much at the heart of a functioning health&#13;
system, and that health infrastructureâ&#128;&#148; that is, hospital systems, et cetera, et ceteraâ&#128;&#148; need to be&#13;
systematically strengthened, and that this is the way to achieve better health.&#13;
&#13;
On the other side of the spectrum are folks with a technological bias who say that health systems&#13;
are largely a combination of disease control efforts. Yes, that hospitals need to be functioningâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
they determine the legitimacy of a health systemâ&#128;&#148;but they look at it more from the&#13;
technological end.&#13;
&#13;
And after the Alma-Ata discussion, which we referred to earlier, these things really became two&#13;
different schools of thought: the primary healthcare movement and what we call the selective&#13;
private healthcare movement. And often the discussion is simplified around the notion vertical&#13;
versus horizontal, which really doesnâ&#128;&#153;t catch the issue. For the last, I would say, 25 years, the&#13;
technological aspect of health service delivery has driven the field ahead.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Despite the Alma-Ata Declaration?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Despite the Alma-Ata Declaration. Global health initiatives are today largely disease&#13;
control programsâ&#128;&#148;polio eradication. You have the malaria programs, which went up and down,&#13;
and now up again. You have the programs of lymphatic filariasis control or elimination (that is&#13;
elephantiasis, in more popular terms).&#13;
&#13;
The vaccination, childhood vaccination programs have been solidly entrenched in the health&#13;
systems. We started from measles campaign in West Africa, then we went to integrated&#13;
diseaseâ&#128;&#148; childhood disease control programs, EPI [expanded programs on immunization]. And&#13;
now we are broadening the spectrum of vaccinations via GAVI [Global Alliance for&#13;
Vaccinations and Immunization] and so on; I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to go through them. But that side of the&#13;
health system has very, very effectively maneuvered.&#13;
&#13;
The other side of the spectrum, the support to general health services, has been a problem. It is&#13;
fair to say that the Bank has had a major part in not helping this side of the spectrum.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The primary healthcare side?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, the primary healthcare side.&#13;
&#13;
When the oil price issues hit in the â&#128;&#152;80s, the major preoccupation of the Bank, as you very well&#13;
know, became to keep the balance sheet of the LDCs [less-developed countries], particularly in&#13;
Africa, somewhat in the black. So we started with our structural adjustment loans. We initially&#13;
really focused in terms of stabilizing the overall economy, and that makes sense. People did not&#13;
really look at the implications; i.e., what this meant for the social sector.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Including in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The Bank was one of the main proponents of structural adjustment. Still, today, people&#13;
are almost harshly in a denial state. The facts are undeniable. And that doesnâ&#128;&#153;t mean that the&#13;
structural adjustment operations didnâ&#128;&#153;t have their positive side. Oh, no, only for the health sector&#13;
per se they were not particularly helpful in many countries because we were slashing the public&#13;
payroll, floating the exchange rate, et cetera. All the measures that the Washington Consensus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
were applied, basically, uniformly to almost all countries. Iâ&#128;&#153;m exaggerating a bit, but that is a&#13;
perception of the health sector.&#13;
&#13;
This resulted in many countries in enormous difficulties to finance the health sectorâ&#128;&#148;for&#13;
example, health manpower. I did a study four years ago in looking at Africaâ&#128;&#153;s health manpower.&#13;
I did a staff working paper as well [Liese, Bernhard and Gilles Dussault. The State of the Health&#13;
Workforce in Sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence of Crisis and Analysis of Contributing Factors,&#13;
Africa Region Human Development Working Papers Series. September 2004]. Kind of&#13;
shocking to see the reduction in income. Cameroonian health workers lost around 70 percent of&#13;
income over a period of 13 years. That includes, actually, the devaluation of the franc CFA&#13;
[Communaute Financiere Africaine], which contributed to that. Well, that might be an extreme&#13;
kind of case. But since I used to work in Cameroon running actually the health services, going&#13;
back it broke my heart to see that many of the things which one had built up were simply falling&#13;
apart.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You said devaluation contributed to that. What other factors would contribute to&#13;
such a precipitous decline in income?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, they basically froze all kinds of benefits, froze salary increases. They reducedâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
they literally reduced salary gradually in steps and steps. And so the total income calculated was&#13;
reduced by almost two-thirds. Obviously, health providersâ&#128;&#148;the ones which we had trained,&#13;
nurses, et ceteraâ&#128;&#148;left the health sector. You had internal migration to other sectors. If you go&#13;
to Yaounde to one of the larger hotels, the receptionist is most likely a nurse or somebody who&#13;
comes from the health sector.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So some of them could have immigrated to Europe or the United States.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes. I had one, you know, colleague here, Michael [N.] Azefor, who was part of that&#13;
group. Cameroon might be a stark example, but in shades of gray we have seen that quite a bit.&#13;
And investments in hospitals, for example, equally, the Bank hasnâ&#128;&#153;t made many. Very few&#13;
donors did. District hospitals, yes, a bit. But not many. And central hospitals, tertiary&#13;
healthcare practice, practically no investment.&#13;
&#13;
But if you go around and look at many of the big hospitals in African cities, you are shocked by&#13;
the state of affairs. Tremendous issues of quality of care, you know, in terms of what actually&#13;
could be done--structural ways in which services are provided, that the wards are, having proper&#13;
patient records, et cetera, et cetera, all these qualitative measures--I think we could have done a&#13;
lot about that. Instead, I think we focused on the so-called health sector reform. And my&#13;
personal view is that this didnâ&#128;&#153;t help to improve systems. Take user chargesâ&#128;&#148; you know, user&#13;
feesâ&#128;&#148;thatâ&#128;&#153;s fine, letâ&#128;&#153;s make the user support the health system, but we didnâ&#128;&#153;t think through this.&#13;
We didnâ&#128;&#153;t really look at the implications.&#13;
&#13;
My personal view, which Iâ&#128;&#153;ve expressed many times, has been that the health sector reform&#13;
movement was a fig leaf to hide the fact that at the end of the Cold War, official development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
assistance for Africa dropped considerably. It dropped to about half the level it had been before.&#13;
And so the countries had real difficulties to finance the services. There would have been ways to&#13;
increase ODA [official development assistance], but we basically said, â&#128;&#156;Why donâ&#128;&#153;t you reform&#13;
your health services? Make them more efficient.â&#128;&#157; There were elements of that approach which&#13;
were quite useful, but I have considerable hesitations to believe that the health sector reform&#13;
movement was not merely a whitewash.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So this health sector reform movement wasnâ&#128;&#153;t just the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: No.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I mean, it was much more broad.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: It was broad. The Bank was one of them, right.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been, as you know, traveling around quite a bit to the countries. Countries have&#13;
always been looking at some of these health sector reform issues with an element of doubt.&#13;
Certain elements were meaningful. If you look at user charges, for example, which could in&#13;
particular cases be quite useful if they are properly managed and so on, but one has to look at the&#13;
details before one deals with that.&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;ll give you an example. In Indonesia, a special programâ&#128;&#148;Inpres Desa Tertinggalâ&#128;&#148;basically&#13;
built health centers in rural areas, provided the money to staff that, et cetera. But there was a&#13;
user charge for patients. And the patients which were not able to pay were exempted from the&#13;
user charge. Now Indonesia has a system which actually could do that because they have a&#13;
village classification system in which they pretty much know who is indigent. So that might be&#13;
one of the countries where user charges actually work. The user charges were fixed at 500&#13;
rupiahs, if I recall correctly.&#13;
&#13;
We looked at that several years later. It makes sense. It makes senseâ&#128;&#148; right? Well, we found&#13;
that the user charges had gone up in the meantime, 1,500, 2,000 rupiahs, collected from&#13;
everybody. What was happening? Well, it turned out that the doctors at the health centers&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#153;t retain the funds; they had to give it to the district officerâ&#128;&#148;not the district health officer,&#13;
the district officer, and that the district officer used for fixing roads, et cetera, because it was his&#13;
only source of cash income. So what you had done effectively was levied an illness tax on the&#13;
poorest of the poor. Just the opposite of what we actually wanted to do.&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;m saying that one has to look at some of these proposed measures; very carefully look to see&#13;
what impact it actually might have had.&#13;
&#13;
Now, these days the notion of health systems strengthening is back. You know, over the last&#13;
couple of years with the new policy paper of the Bank we are back to systems thinking. We&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                    April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
have, basically, switched back to 25 years earlier. Today we acknowledge that there is a&#13;
tremendous shortage of manpower, that this is a major issue which needs to be addressed. There&#13;
is no question that the hospitals need to be rehabilitated and so on.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were involved during this time in one of the most successful, long-term, multi-&#13;
donor programs in the history of the World Bank, which succeeded in controlling riverblindness&#13;
in West Africa. How did you come to be involved in this effort?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, when I came to the Bank, Jim Lee, my boss at that time, gave me a dossier of&#13;
backup material and said, â&#128;&#156;There is a problem; you might want to look at that. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s something&#13;
from the Africa Region, and Steve [Stephen M.] Denning deals with that. Just have a look.â&#128;&#157; He&#13;
was obviously doubtful whether one could do anything.&#13;
&#13;
Well, I looked at it, and I got marginally involved, and informed myself as well. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t do&#13;
much. Went sometimes to a meeting, followed up then.&#13;
&#13;
Marc [L.] Bazin was then appointed by the Bank as the director of the program, and he actually&#13;
organized OCP [Onchocerciasis Control Program]. And then, several years laterâ&#128;&#148; it was in the&#13;
early â&#128;&#152;80sâ&#128;&#148; the program popped up because people said this is now definitely going to fail.&#13;
We had re-invasion of the black flies, the flies which transmit the disease, and that meant that in&#13;
areas where the spraying program for onchocerciasis had been successful, suddenly new flies&#13;
popped up, and they were not local; theyâ&#128;&#153;re traveling 100, 150 kilometers. So the notion was&#13;
that we will never be able to eliminate the fly population for ten years or so in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
Youâ&#128;&#153;ll recall that the control technology was to interrupt transmission of the disease by killing&#13;
the larvae of the black flies in the river, which are breeding in the highly-oxygenated water of&#13;
rapids, and then to do that over a huge area. Well, if the flies always come back and re-infect&#13;
these rapids, then that thing is going to fail. In addition, resistance to the only pesticide which&#13;
was used, temephos, had emerged. And the feeling that this was a complete loser, this OCP&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This point is around the early 1980s?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, the early 1980s. OCP had established an independent commission to make&#13;
proposals. The report said that OCP probably has to enlarge the epidemiological area of control&#13;
and so on. I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to go into detail. And in the end, it was decided that there was no reason&#13;
to give up, but that one had to enlarge the program. Furthermore, a decision was taken to&#13;
prepare a long-term strategy for the program.&#13;
&#13;
And I got involved, hands on, in the long-term strategy of the program. I actually did the costing,&#13;
with a colleague of mine, and ever since until today I have been involved. And despite the fact&#13;
that Iâ&#128;&#153;ve had various jobs in the Bank, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always kept one foot in that program. I have to say I&#13;
dearly love it because it is an extraordinarily successful program. But it is not the success only.&#13;
OCP can provide a lot of lessons for how one operates an international disease control program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                   April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Such as?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The program survived when resistance emerged because it had wisely decided to&#13;
investigate in operations research. Yes, there was only one pesticide available for operational&#13;
use. But the program had gone ahead quite a while ago and tested other possibilities, so they&#13;
could switch to a different pesticide.&#13;
&#13;
Sorry, I said temephos before; Abate, it was the one for which resistance emerged. Abate. So&#13;
temephos was suddenly available, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
There were different pesticides which could be tested. The program had the methodology in&#13;
place to test them, which consistedâ&#128;&#148; you will chuckleâ&#128;&#148; in Bobo-Dioulasso airport, there were&#13;
barrels, you know, 20 barrels with water. The choppers are flying over them, laying their beam&#13;
over them with different pesticides. And then when they saw what the larvae kill rate was, they&#13;
could then basically predict what you would see it in using it on the rapids, measuring how&#13;
effective that would be.&#13;
&#13;
OCP are equally invested in technology to check what the water level was. Formerly someone&#13;
was running, measuring the water, but thatâ&#128;&#153;s difficult if you have thousands of rapids. OCP now&#13;
has put in buoys, and they beam the water level to a satellite, and then the signal was picked up&#13;
by the chopper and . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Somewhat high tech, in other words?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: High tech. The program has developed a combination of high tech and low tech, with&#13;
fly catchersâ&#128;&#148;people sitting with their bare legs on the river and, you know, waiting until a fly&#13;
came and then catching it. But the most important one was that the program had always had this&#13;
â&#128;&#156;letâ&#128;&#153;s look at what else we could doâ&#128;&#157; attitude. Letâ&#128;&#153;s develop operations research. De facto,&#13;
roughly 20 percent of program expenditures during these years were for operations research.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which is fairly significant . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Very.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: . . compared to what one would normally find.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The earlier malaria eradication program basically spent nothing on operations research.&#13;
It promptly failed. So when we were confronted with problems in OCP, there were possibilities&#13;
to find ways around the problem. One very important lesson.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, the technical staff of the program were very, very competent people. OCP developed,&#13;
for example, systems which were entirely new. Pesticide rotation schemes, which are now used&#13;
in agriculture, but they came out of the OCP. They basically assumed that the pesticide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
eventually becomes subject to resistance, but then after a while the resistance might fade away&#13;
due to the change in fauna and flora, so maybe one can rotate pesticides, use them according to a&#13;
particular pattern.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Because the fly population probably turns over quickly, the life span of the&#13;
individual fly . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Right, right . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: . . is fairly short.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: . . right, short. So they tested out these pesticide rotation schemes and, lo and behold, it&#13;
worked; a big step ahead in general resistance control.&#13;
&#13;
So OCP did a long-term strategy and shared it with the donor community--Bilsel Alisbah was, at&#13;
the time, the vice president responsible for OCP--but the donor community, which had been&#13;
supporting the program, was still sitting on the fence. And Bilsel then said, â&#128;&#156;Why donâ&#128;&#153;t we do a&#13;
plan of operations as well? A long-term strategy and, in addition, a plan of operations.â&#128;&#157; So the&#13;
Bank helped in terms of the political assessment to keep the donor coalition together, you know,&#13;
sensing where the shoe pinchesâ&#128;&#148; right?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Which were some of the agencies and donors who did participate?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: There were about initially 18 or so, including USAID, the Germans, the U.K. and&#13;
France, all the large kind of donor nations were sitting around the table. That was really a&#13;
collection of â&#128;&#156;Who is Whoâ&#128;&#157; in the field of health assistance.&#13;
&#13;
I just want to make one more point on the program.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, please.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The aerial operationâ&#128;&#148; spraying of the riversâ&#128;&#148; was done basically until the early â&#128;&#152;90s.&#13;
And then ivermectin, a drug, became available, with which you could basically kill the&#13;
microfilariaeâ&#128;&#148; the baby wormsâ&#128;&#148; which were responsible for the transmission, which was a&#13;
major, major advancement. W e still would like to kill the adult worms with a drug but we donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
have one. And suddenly the program was able to shift from what you would label as a high tech&#13;
control, by chopper, to a community-based approach. I mean, you have never seen a shift from&#13;
the left side of the spectrum to the right side of the spectrum by any comparable program.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: From high tech to low tech, in other words.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: From high tech to low tech to behavioral and community-based distribution, which&#13;
means that the communities organize it themselves. It didnâ&#128;&#153;t cause trouble or anxiety amongst&#13;
staff. It was something new, maybe a better idea to work with. One has to hand it to OCP staff&#13;
colleagues because their reaction was strictly professional. They said, â&#128;&#156;If it works better, then&#13;
letâ&#128;&#153;s move in this direction.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I believe it was indigenous people, local people, who were trained to distribute the&#13;
drug. Am I correct?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes. Actually, they were selected by the community. So one goes to a community, to&#13;
the chief, and says, "This is the situation. Could we have a 'palaver' about it?" And then the&#13;
chief of the village or the elders elect a community distributor, so that everybody gets the drug.&#13;
The whole implementation mechanism is basically woven into the village.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was it well received at the local level?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Very well received.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So they understood the advantages?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yes. Actually, the technology is now widely used for other disease control&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
Interesting. When the basic studies on community-based distributionâ&#128;&#148;ComDTâ&#128;&#148;were done by&#13;
TDRâ&#128;&#148;the tropical disease research program. We did studies in Africa and in India. It worked&#13;
everywhere in Africa, but ComDT didnâ&#128;&#153;t work in India due to a caste society and issues of&#13;
responsibility. The issue in India was: who is responsible? Itâ&#128;&#153;s not my responsibility, the&#13;
community felt; it's the Ministry of Health. It was a culture element with them.&#13;
&#13;
Maybeâ&#128;&#148; and the last point on the oncho program isâ&#128;&#148; well, two more points. The program&#13;
always had a three- or four-day meeting every year with all the donors, which was highly&#13;
technical. And a lot of people asked why we do that. But I believe it was very important&#13;
because you involve the donor community into the real technical decision. And it was totally&#13;
transparent. So there was no whitewashing on marketing. People said, â&#128;&#156;Well, call a spade a&#13;
spade.â&#128;&#157; And so a culture was developed amongst the donor community which was one of trust;&#13;
one should not underestimate that.&#13;
&#13;
The donor community has stayed with that program for the last 30 years. And we were in&#13;
December in Brussels, and we extended the program until 2015. We were thinking that a lot of&#13;
donors would drop out and that we would have a shortage of funding. On the contrary, we asked&#13;
for $50 million additional funding; we got $95 million additional funding. So I think maybe the&#13;
human aspect ofâ&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s understood that that is a family and that family has certain responsibility&#13;
and that there is complete clarity and visibility and transparency within that group, so people&#13;
stick with it.&#13;
&#13;

ZIEGLER: On what other constituent bodies of WHO-executed multi-donor projects did you&#13;
represent the Bank, and of what did your duties consist on these constituent bodies?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, the one where I represented the Bank for many, many yearsâ&#128;&#148; I think 20 yearsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
was the Tropical Diseases Research Programmeâ&#128;&#148; the UNDP-WHO-World Bank program in&#13;
training and research for tropical diseases. That is a very important, has been a very important&#13;
program in the health field because it basically has provided the research underpinning for many&#13;
of the disease control operations.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What were the major challenges in managing and implementing multi-donor&#13;
projects, and how did you address them? Youâ&#128;&#153;ve touched on this, certainly, in your discussion&#13;
of the riverblindness, but perhaps just focus a bit on that specific issue.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, I did TDRâ&#128;&#148;tropical disease research. I as well did acute respiratory infections.&#13;
There were several other ones. And when HIV-AIDS started, I was responsible for that one, too.&#13;
So I have done my share of sitting in board meetings of programs; quite a few, actually, over the&#13;
years. Sometimes the issue has been to represent the interests of the Bank. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve had a very&#13;
cordial relationship with WHO, despite the fact that we were not always of the same opinion.&#13;
WHO was, for example, over the last decade very interested to mainstreaming TDR, which had&#13;
been a separate program, into WHO. We were not.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: TDR is . . . ?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases. To mainstream&#13;
that program into a WHO division, basically. The program was not constructed that way. The&#13;
program had its board. It had its donor community. The program had its statutory bodies. It has&#13;
independent funding. And so it would have not have been a wise idea to make TDR a WHO&#13;
unit. Why would you do that? Only for reasons of turf. So we had to quite clearly put the foot&#13;
down and say that is not going to work. Keep TDR separate.&#13;
&#13;
I actually chaired the only donors meeting which we ever had for TDR in Paris. And initially&#13;
that donors meeting was opposed by the World Health Organization just for territorial reasons.&#13;
[Dr.] David [L.] Heymann didnâ&#128;&#153;t like it. And we walked away with literally doubling the budget&#13;
of TDR. But so strong are the various turf issues, the we control or you control, because the&#13;
Bank has been seen by WHO very much as a competitor. It has not been seen as a collaborator.&#13;
Wrongly, actually. And so one had to maneuver a little bit on these accounts.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In July 1990, you became director of the Joint Health Services Department, which&#13;
serves both the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund. How did that&#13;
appointment come about? And to me this is particularly interesting because you were obviously&#13;
involved in many operational aspects of health services, health delivery for member countries,&#13;
and here your focus suddenly shifts to the internal aspects. So it would be interesting to hear&#13;
how the shift came about, from your perspective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                 April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I worked under the onchocerciasis program very closely with Bilsel Alisbah, because&#13;
he was in charge of OCP. And so it happened that Bilsel, who had also just taken over the&#13;
Human Resources Vice Presidency, was confronted with an issue: the director of the Health&#13;
Services Department, Michael [H. K.] Irwin, who came from UNDP, had somehow provided&#13;
material for an unbelievable article which appeared in The Wall Street Journal.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I recall that very well.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes. That was kind of shocking.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was highly critical of many Bank practices, as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Very, very critical. That was really a totally unfair, nonsensical article, but it did a lot&#13;
of damage. He obviously disappeared. He actually disappeared. He wasnâ&#128;&#153;t fired. He&#13;
disappeared. And so Bilsel was left with the fact that he needed to have somebody to run that&#13;
internal Health Services Department. The qualifications for that wereâ&#128;&#148; because it was a&#13;
demoralized lot at the timeâ&#128;&#148; that one had reasonable managerial qualifications, that one was a&#13;
loyal Bank person, and one would not write further articlesâ&#128;&#148;be â&#128;&#156;illiterate."&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: So Bilsel came and asked whether I would be willing to do that for a couple of years.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And what was your perception of the atmosphere in the department on your arrival?&#13;
You say it was demoralized. The staff was feeling pretty down about the whole Michael Irwin&#13;
affair?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Very much so, yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So it did have a real effect on the morale of the department.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: A very real effect on the morale of the department. There are many dysfunctional&#13;
features of that.&#13;
&#13;
And I went to Ernie Stern because there was an agreement which I had with Bilsel and senior&#13;
management. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to go permanently to a service department.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which the Health Services Department is, of course.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Right. And I said, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;ll do that but I have one condition: that I can do 20 or 30 percent&#13;
of my time still doing operational work, because these are the things which I know and which I&#13;
like. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s why Iâ&#128;&#153;m here at the Bank.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And Bilsel said, â&#128;&#156;That is fine. So two years, a maximum three years.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Werenâ&#128;&#153;t you kind of sticking your neck out? Because managing a department&#13;
would seem to me to be a full-time job. I mean, youâ&#128;&#153;re obviously a very talented individual, but&#13;
even a person of your stature can be stretched, or over-stretched a bit, perhaps.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yesâ&#128;&#148; no, I was very clear. That was somehowâ&#128;&#148; I didnâ&#128;&#153;t see myself as being corporate&#13;
medical director, you know, for the next ten years, which actually happened . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: . . later on. So I had that agreement.&#13;
&#13;
And I went up to Ernie Stern, and Ernie said, â&#128;&#156;Well, the department is treated almost like a&#13;
soccer ball that is pushed around from one corner to another one,â&#128;&#157; which was true if you looked&#13;
at the history. And there were very peculiar dysfunctional features in the department. How they&#13;
had emerged, I do not know. The nurses had decided that they were so overworked that they had&#13;
to take two-hour lunch breaks. Nobody in the Bank has a two-hour lunch break. And it was a&#13;
very complicated kind of place.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Health Services Department is unusual in the Bank in that it serves both the&#13;
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. What were the particular challenges of that&#13;
arrangement, and how did you proceed to address them?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: That actually caused less problems than I ever thoughtâ&#128;&#148; the dual ownershipâ&#128;&#148; because&#13;
one had simply to talk with the folks over on the other side, which I did. And we established a&#13;
very close relationship on the Fund side. So they left us a tremendous flexibility and were really&#13;
an excellent customer, or client.&#13;
&#13;
The challenge with the department was to make the department into something which would be&#13;
functional. And that was actually a big challenge.&#13;
&#13;
One opportunity would have been to, basically, re-staff the department and find new folks. I&#13;
decided not to do that. I thought that it would be easier to work with the present staff which was&#13;
there toâ&#128;&#148; and provide a framework in which that staff could see itself functioning. And so we&#13;
developed corporate objectives, goals, you know, visualization of sailing ahead of the crew, you&#13;
know, and many of these things which you might have heard. And we involved quite a number&#13;
of consultants, initially, to help us in retreats. So we did a lot of servicing ourselves. I think that&#13;
paid off because de facto, except for one colleague years later, nobody left. And the department&#13;
changed its perspective considerably. We built as well up the notion that we would be a service&#13;
department, which tends to be forgotten sometimes. So, therefore, the customer is always,&#13;
always right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                   April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Indeed, that was going to be my next point, which is to discuss your client-oriented&#13;
approach as it related to the Health Services Department.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The Health Services Department is a service department. Physicians and nurses have&#13;
always the tendency to become self-centered, to decide what isâ&#128;&#148; because they tend to know, or&#13;
believe they know, that they know what is right and that, therefore, the patient has to act in an&#13;
almost slavish way: I tell you what to do, and you do it. That cannot be the attitude of the&#13;
Health Services Department. It cannot. It would be deadly.&#13;
&#13;
So the notion was to change it around almost like a hotel system, to make the customer&#13;
comfortable. Look at what they want. Look at what they require. And then respond to that. So&#13;
there were a lot of discussions with operational divisions in the Bank. And so we got accepted&#13;
rather quickly.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: It seems to me that the outsourcing mania of the past few years, the Health Services&#13;
Department, given its function, should have been vulnerable to outsourcing. How is it that the&#13;
department has remained intact?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, the outsourcing issue became very, very, very prominent. There was a lot of&#13;
pressure.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: About when did that start?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: That started almost a year after I had taken over.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So about 1991?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: In â&#128;&#152;91 or â&#128;&#152;92 there was a lot of pressure to outsource. And we resisted that, not because&#13;
we wanted to protect the jobs of the boys or the girls. And no, we went systematically around&#13;
and looked at best practice in the sector in occupational health. That actually helped. We went&#13;
everywhere, to Boeing, to Exxon, you know, to Philips in the Netherlands. We looked really&#13;
around what was done. And thenâ&#128;&#148; we had relationships. We could marshal people in to help, if&#13;
needed, to look at particular issues.&#13;
&#13;
And secondly, it became very clear that you would have many more possibilities to maneuver&#13;
around if you would have services in-house. People liked that, actually.&#13;
&#13;
Then we looked at the cost implications, and calculated that and, lo and behold, it turned out that&#13;
it would actually be cheaper, considerably cheaper.&#13;
&#13;
And there was pressure. There were pressures from colleagues which principally were on the&#13;
health side to outsource, in the same vein like, you know, sector reformâ&#128;&#148; private sector. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
the way it is. We resisted that. But it was sometimes a tough battle in the Bank. And it turned&#13;
outâ&#128;&#148; it turned out that it worked really quite well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
ZIEGLER: During your time in the Health Services Department, you implemented an&#13;
increased communication program with staff of the Bank and the Fund. What were the&#13;
improvements in the existing programâ&#128;&#153;s communication that you sought to implement, and how&#13;
did this program evolve over the nearly ten years that you were director of the department?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: We put a lot of effort on communication because you have to, using various media, not&#13;
only one, so Health Beat and the travel web page was developed, et cetera, et cetera. So we used&#13;
a lot of effort of communication, which paid off because it is exactly what you do in the private&#13;
sector. You market your business, and then people relate to it. And as I said, multimedia,&#13;
different venues, conferences, Health Beat, but maybe the most effective communication&#13;
program for the department is actually not a media per se, like an article in a paper. But it was&#13;
the fitness program.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which weâ&#128;&#153;ll get into.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes. Because that really was associated with the department, and you recall that we&#13;
grew it up systematically and marketed it as part of the department.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: An article appears in September 1992 issue of The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s World entitled, â&#128;&#156;The&#13;
Issues of Work and Family - A Conversation with Dr. Bernhard Liese and Brian [Francis]&#13;
Donnolley.â&#128;&#157; The introduction to the article states, â&#128;&#156;Perhaps no recent internal Bank initiative has&#13;
interested staff as much as the Report of the Joint Working Group on the Work-Family Agenda&#13;
for the World Bank. The report is the culmination of a one-year study by a working group&#13;
comprising of members appointed by the Staff Association and the Office of the Vice President,&#13;
Personnel and Administration. The World Bank Volunteer Services was also represented. Dr.&#13;
Bernhard Liese, Director of Health Services, is the groupâ&#128;&#153;s chairman. Brian Donnolley,&#13;
Personnel Services and Compensation Department, is the groupâ&#128;&#153;s secretary.â&#128;&#157; According to the&#13;
article, the report proposed three clusters of recommendations that are directed at, one, creating a&#13;
more flexible working environment; two, creating a more family-supportive environment; and,&#13;
three, implementation and culture change. Viewed now retrospectively, what were the practical&#13;
accomplishments of this working group?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: The compressed work week maybe is the most visible.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And I was the beneficiary of that, personally.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, it was an initiative of Bilselâ&#128;&#153;s, which originated, actually, in the Staff Association,&#13;
if I recall. And Brian Donnolley, whom you know, had an almost encyclopedic knowledge of&#13;
these issues. So he was an extraordinary help.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We went around and looked at, again, practices of other organizations, and we all were almost&#13;
shocked to see how archaic we were in terms of dealing with our staff. And so the working&#13;
group set out systematically to improve the working conditions of staff; the issue was not to&#13;
increase the productivity. The goal was to improve the working conditions for the staff in their&#13;
own right. There were many areas in which that could be done, and so we basically packaged it,&#13;
the final report on the work and family agenda.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were fairly certain that you wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t result in a reduction of productivity,&#13;
though, Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes. Because we had seen everywhere where we went that there was overbounding&#13;
evidence, nationally and internationally, that these had made working conditions better. And it&#13;
catered to the change in the work environment.&#13;
&#13;
It went to the Bay Area in San Francisco because there were enormous traffic jams at that time,&#13;
which are coming here to Washington now. Well, therefore on the West Coast the question of&#13;
flexible work hours had to be explored because there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t really any alternativeâ&#128;&#148; or working&#13;
from home and possibilities of that nature.&#13;
&#13;
We had here at the Bank specific areas which had to do with the nature of the G-4 [visa] status of&#13;
the Bank which had to be dealt with as well. Employment! Because we donâ&#128;&#153;t really look at&#13;
spouses if they find a job, or you do not find a job. So you needed to deal with employment&#13;
possibilities as well and facilitate that.&#13;
&#13;
So we looked at the work life of Bank staff, particularly colleagues who came from abroad, their&#13;
different needs. And we came up with this booklet, The Work and Family Agenda, which has&#13;
quite a number of recommendations. Practically all the recommendations got accepted.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now who would have been responsible for accepting them? Presumably Bilsel?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Bilsel accepted them. And it was going to be a joint undertaking with the Staff&#13;
Association.&#13;
&#13;
The recommendation which was not accepted was the compressed work week. That was&#13;
something people felt that was too radical. And then . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Although, eventually, that did get implemented.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Iâ&#128;&#153;ll come to that in a minute. And the other recommendation had to do with phased&#13;
retirement, that basically you could work on a part-time, phased-in retirement. And I,&#13;
personally, think that still would have been a good thing to do in hindsight because that is what&#13;
actually has happenedâ&#128;&#148;right?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You and I are examples of that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Exactly, exactly. So the compressed work week was something which people said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Well, that works for Exxon, that works in the Federal government, but that canâ&#128;&#153;t work in the&#13;
Bank because people are here all the time. And if you do that, we will reduce productivity.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
There was quite a disagreement about that. And we finally could persuade Bilsel that we would&#13;
take ten departments and do a pilot study. That we got through.&#13;
&#13;
So we did the pilot study. I have forgotten whether it was a year or nine months. But it was a&#13;
considerable time for the proper evaluation. Boy, did we spend time on it. And the results were&#13;
extraordinarily positive. So nothing of the concerns which were expressed earlier were valid; we&#13;
could verify.&#13;
&#13;
The one concern, though, which turned up, which had to be dealt with, was that support staff&#13;
could see that as an â&#128;&#156;entitlementâ&#128;&#157; and that we were clearly advising managers that this is a â&#128;&#156;work&#13;
accommodationâ&#128;&#157; not an entitlement.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, youâ&#128;&#153;re talking about the compressed work week?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Compressed work week. And not an entitlement. And for support staff, that is a work&#13;
accommodation and not an entitlement. And today you see that that part of it, in my view, hasnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
been systematically managed. You find problems in the support staff side. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what we had&#13;
seen in other institutions. Where that was properly managed, the issue wasnâ&#128;&#153;t there. But for the&#13;
professional staff, we could find no downside to it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How would one properly manage that, in your view?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: By basically insisting that people are there, you know, during particular times. Or there&#13;
are agreements that somebody else covers.&#13;
&#13;
It has been my observation that managers in the Bank donâ&#128;&#153;t manage the support-level staff. But&#13;
that wasnâ&#128;&#153;t the issue which was at the table at the time. The issue on the table was: â&#128;&#156;Bank staff&#13;
will work less. We canâ&#128;&#153;t do it.â&#128;&#157; Jessica [P.] Einhorn was dead opposed to it, for example. And&#13;
so we presented the results to the vice presidents, and it was turned down.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Even after the experimental pilot study?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Turned down. And then we wentâ&#128;&#148;I convinced Bilsel (and then later on [S.] Shahid&#13;
[Husain] came) that we should continue the pilot. And Bilsel said yes, and Shahid then agreed&#13;
that it would continue.&#13;
&#13;
So we did a second evaluation six months later or so. We went one-and-a-half years into it or&#13;
almost two years. It showed exactly the same trends. And we went up then to Shahid, to the&#13;
vice president. And Jessica went on a rampage. Sorry to say that because I shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t say it. She&#13;
was totally convinced that this was destroying the Bank. So we got stuck the second time. But&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the notion was now that we had to continue the pilot for the units which were on the pilot. It&#13;
would have really caused an uproar if we would have taken them off. So Shahid said continue.&#13;
And then three months later or so when [World Bank President] Jim [James D.] Wolfensohn was&#13;
in a good mood, Shahid and myself went to Jim, and then it was agreed upon. I mean this was&#13;
really a forceps delivery. This was truly a forceps delivery.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Sometimes those result in birth defects. Not in this case, luckily.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes. And later on it became a really popular part of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s culture.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: People really appreciate it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, I note that it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t applied uniformly throughout the Bank. For instance, my&#13;
understanding was that HSD [Health Services Department] itself did not adopt the compressed&#13;
work week.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes. We left it to the divisional managers to agree whether it could be adopted or not&#13;
adopted. And some small departments, like HSD, had actually difficulties to do it. And we&#13;
askedâ&#128;&#148;in HSD I asked, as you recall, around whether we wanted to do it or whether we didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
want to do it. And then the majority of folks said, â&#128;&#156;No, thatâ&#128;&#153;s not for us.â&#128;&#157; And so it happened.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: One of the most popular programs sponsored by the Health Services Department is&#13;
the corporate fitness program, which you mentioned briefly earlier. It had relatively modest&#13;
beginnings in the mid-â&#128;&#152;70s, but is now, as I understand it, it is the largest in the U.S.A., with&#13;
approximately 4,300 members. Please relate something of the initiatives that you undertook with&#13;
this program and how it evolved during the time you were director of the Health Services&#13;
Department. I can recall some articles in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;sâ&#128;&#148; in fact, in the 1970s, in Bank Notes&#13;
showing some disused room in the old N Building being used at lunchtime for exercise purposes.&#13;
I mean, this is just a bare floor with carpeting, and people in exercise gear just doing calisthenics&#13;
and the like.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: We had three locations when I came. There were three little rooms and two people&#13;
who had been hired from outside, part-time, to be something like fitness instructors, or whatever&#13;
you call them. We had one in the I Building, one in the Main Complex, and one in the Africa [J]&#13;
Building. Tiny little areas with a little bit of equipment. And then we had a group of volunteers&#13;
who were very articulate, who were basically aerobics instructors. That was the fitness program.&#13;
And it was characterized by a really aggressive attitude of some of these fitness instructors, who&#13;
are now my friends, but one called meâ&#128;&#148; I donâ&#128;&#153;tâ&#128;&#148; I will not repeat what she said. She regrets it&#13;
these days. So they were managing the place. But it was really, truly dysfunctional.&#13;
&#13;
The new MC Building was going up, and somewhere on the third floor below ground, in the&#13;
garage area in the plans, there was an area in which a larger fitness center should be constructed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But there was roughly only an area which was dedicated for them, no allocation or anything. It&#13;
goes to the credit of Bilsel Alisbah, who really supported me there. We said, â&#128;&#156;Look, corporate&#13;
fitness is something which is really coming up these days. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s something which we need to&#13;
provide. Why donâ&#128;&#153;t we try to find a room, a space where we could anchor a corporate fitness&#13;
center? A decent one.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Well, we looked around and then, as you recall, we found some space near the Archives in the H&#13;
Building. And there were some fitness instructors who were really quite competent in other&#13;
areas. One of them, Clare, had developed quite some architectural knowledge. The idea was&#13;
maybe one could hang really a fitness center into the two floors with three levels, and things like&#13;
that. That was dreamt up internally. That wasnâ&#128;&#153;t an architect from outside. Just scouting&#13;
around.&#13;
&#13;
Then I went to Harinder [S.] Kohli, who was, you know, in charge of the facilities at that time,&#13;
and said that Iâ&#128;&#153;d be willing to trade this very wonderful space in the new MC Building if you&#13;
give me that H Building area.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, this is around what year? The mid-â&#128;&#152;90s?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, that was earlier, around â&#128;&#152;91 or â&#128;&#152;92. It was quite early. And Harinder, whom I&#13;
knew very well personally, said, â&#128;&#156;Yes, I want that, if that is okay.â&#128;&#157; He said, in principle, â&#128;&#156;If&#13;
Bilsel agrees, I can do that for you. Itâ&#128;&#153;s easier for us.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I went to Bilsel and asked whether he would be willing to give us something like $1 million.&#13;
Shocking. And we would repay once the fitness center was up. We would. So, basically, that he&#13;
would, from the capital budget of the Bank, allocate about $1 million for the construction of a&#13;
new fitness center. And Bilsel was a very strong supporter of that. Bilsel said, â&#128;&#156;Why donâ&#128;&#153;t we&#13;
do that? You can go ahead. But it has to be amortized later on and repaid on schedule.â&#128;&#157; So we&#13;
then got an architect from GSD [General Services Department] and so on, and I went to the&#13;
details. And the Fitness Center was built.&#13;
&#13;
You cannot believeâ&#128;&#148;you cannot believe the kind of aggression and accusation and anger which&#13;
came from part of this fitness community. Bilsel got it often, but I got it all the time: â&#128;&#156;That is&#13;
incredible. Why is it in the H Building? That is complete nonsense. That takes us ten minutes&#13;
to go over there. You know we can never do that during the lunch break.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: For the record, this was in the basement of the H Building.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: In the basement of the H Building.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The first level down. Right around the corner from where I worked in the&#13;
Archives. Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                   April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes. And so Bilsel and I did walks, walks from the Africa [J] Building to exactly that&#13;
area. Both of us. Believe it. And timed it. With green lights at the traffic or with red lights at&#13;
the traffic lights.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So you crossedâ&#128;&#148; for the record, you crossed two streets.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: We crossed two streets.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And then, actually, three if youâ&#128;&#153;re going to go from, you cross 18th to 19th and&#13;
then G Street, too.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, yes. And we came up with something like maximum three minutes or so. But&#13;
look at it as to what extent we had to go to deal with this argumentâ&#128;&#148;right? Look at the vice&#13;
president and the director of the service walking to check it out. There was a lot of hostility&#13;
around that. Even with the elevators, that the elevators were too little and wasnâ&#128;&#153;t fast enough. It&#13;
showed a very unfriendly, unfriendlyâ&#128;&#148;it showed the underbelly of the institution and the&#13;
thinking about of entitlement and egocentric thinking, really. And very, very surprising. I would&#13;
have never expected that. But it was a big issue. Sometimes Staff Association got involved.&#13;
But we muscled it through. Once the Center was open, all aggression collapsed because the&#13;
center was beautiful. The hostility collapsed. All the hostility collapsed and thereâ&#128;&#148;people were&#13;
saying, â&#128;&#156;Oh, wonderful!â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Some of the design issues had to do with colleagues, you know, Clare Fleming, and several of&#13;
us, including myself, looked at the tapestry for the wallâ&#128;&#148;there was a lot of volunteer work&#13;
involved--and we came in at $890,000. But once this thing opened, it was wonderful. And it is&#13;
wonderful.&#13;
&#13;
And then we started to build up a really first rate facility, and I hired a contractor from outside&#13;
who had been running facilities as an adviser. And I was very lucky to find a manager for the&#13;
Fitness Center, Mike [Michael] James from Australia. He was recruited in Australia. And his&#13;
relaxed Aussie attitude and his laid-back approach, it just fitted that outfit.&#13;
&#13;
We started charging a decent membership fee, $10, initially. And we kept it for almost . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Ten dollars per month?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Per month.&#13;
&#13;
We let people screen membership cards at the entrance, so we could get decent statistics. And&#13;
we built up the number of classes to 60 and membership to almost 4,000 people.&#13;
&#13;
 It still is wonderful. It has been enlarged recently, as you know. We took part of the remaining&#13;
space after Archives moved out. I like to go to the Center. These are my most fond memories of&#13;
the Bank, because many of the fitness instructors, that group became almost a family because it&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
was joyful and energetic. And I would have to say that I really liked to have worked with that&#13;
group.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And the Fitness Center has been hugely popular with staff over the years also. I&#13;
know that.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yes, oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In November 1994 the Health Services Department began an aggressive campaign&#13;
to make mammography available to staff, bringing in the medical technologists, radiologists on&#13;
contract and state-of-the-art equipment needed to implement the campaign. What led you to take&#13;
this initiative, and did it prove to be successful over time?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, we started in the department one area of work which hadnâ&#128;&#153;t been there. Probably&#13;
because I had seen it in many other programs, we started occupational health research. We&#13;
wanted to have an idea of what was the state of health of the Bank staff, so we did a report on&#13;
that, and we created a research capability. And it turned out that from all angles in which we&#13;
looked at it, we had relatively high rates of breast cancer for our staff. Now these are difficult&#13;
things to state, and we compared our staff to reference populations. It turned out in hindsight&#13;
that we were slightly above it because later on Dr. Bernard Demure re-did the study. But it&#13;
showed that we had a relatively high rate of breast cancer and we had a very low utilization of&#13;
our staff on mammography service, preventative service.&#13;
&#13;
So we decided that we would really systematically push mammography, and the easiest way to&#13;
do that was to provide mammography services on the premises. The equipment wasnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
particularly expensive. We could contract the radiologist. So it was very convenient for folks to&#13;
come. And it worked quite well.&#13;
&#13;
You know that mammography services are no longer provided on the premises. That has to do&#13;
with the change in the technology and the cost of the equipment. It would have become really&#13;
extraordinarily expensive and complicated to run the new mammography machines here on the&#13;
premises. One would have had a much larger group here to do that economically. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the&#13;
reason why Bernard Demure reluctantly decided to stop the service four years ago. But initially&#13;
that service helped us dramatically. It helped in establishing that mammography screening was&#13;
absolutely important. We got firmly entrenched. We had as well communication sessions with&#13;
breast cancer survivors, et cetera, et cetera. There was a lot of breast cancer around the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I recall reading that the Bank seemed to have a higher incidence of breast cancer&#13;
than the general population.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, it did.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But this program, over time, an improvement in that trend was reflected as . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                 April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: . . a result of this program?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, later on we basicallyâ&#128;&#148; the mammography rates of Bank staff, which were in the&#13;
90 percent. So almost everybody went.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: During your time as director of the Health Services Department, the Bank&#13;
undertook a significant process of decentralization. This is under Jim Wolfensohn, where things&#13;
really moved out to the field. How did you address the challenges of providing services to staff&#13;
in the various country offices?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: It was complicated. The staff in the different offices had basically to rely on their own&#13;
health systems. But we then went out and negotiated in the context of some of the UN&#13;
organizations, sometimes joint service agreements. We tried to provide as well reference&#13;
physicians that people could go to.&#13;
&#13;
The department took over as well the Medical Insurance Plan for our local staff abroadâ&#128;&#148; the&#13;
MIPâ&#128;&#148; which was, basically, initially a medical assistance plan. It was not insurance. We rebuilt&#13;
it into an insurance plan, which provided basically an almost equivalent insurance coverage than&#13;
we had under Aetna or whatever in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Staff Association, through its Health Issues Working Group, has long had an&#13;
interest in matters of health as they relate to staff. How would you characterize your working&#13;
relationship with the Staff Association, and how did it evolve over time?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I think the relationship with Staff Association on the whole was quite good over the&#13;
years. They were very supportive in complicated areas. Sometimes there were challenges, but&#13;
we sorted them out. And itâ&#128;&#153;s best maybe characterized that we in the department always saw that&#13;
the Staff Association was one of our major constituents, one of our major pillars on which we&#13;
had to lean, and so we behaved accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You introduced an occupational health research program. Among the areas of&#13;
study were video display terminal workstation improvement [Demure, Bernard, Rose S.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Stress Among International Business Travelers." Occupational and Environmental Medicine,&#13;
1999;56(4):245-52]. Were there any other areas of study that deserve mention?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: We looked, obviously, at environmental health issues, to what air qualityâ&#128;&#148;we had a&#13;
contractor and all this stuff.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I recall that, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, the outcome was that we published quite a number of papers. We looked at the&#13;
way in which we were sitting in front of the table because back pain, I think, still is the most&#13;
common problem in the Bank. And we noticed wonderful situations, for example, women try to&#13;
adjust their workstations. They complain loudly but they adjust their workstations so that they&#13;
sit more comfortably. Men never say anything. They donâ&#128;&#153;t complain, and they never adjust the&#13;
workstation. So we had to laugh about some of theseâ&#128;&#148; about some of the outcomes of the study.&#13;
It showed a very interesting spectrum. And then we added them. As you know, Danni&#13;
[Danielle] Ali, who basically ran our Workstation Improvement Program. So we really provided&#13;
decent data on how one would adjust workstations.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I guess that answers, at least in part, my next point, which was: did these studies&#13;
lead directly to any changes in the working environment and conditions in the Bank through&#13;
this?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, yes, in terms of theâ&#128;&#148;equipment wasâ&#128;&#148;different equipment was purchased, et&#13;
cetera. So there was some.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay. So there were . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: . . far-reaching changes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yes, far-reaching changes in terms ofâ&#128;&#148;we discussed them with GSD, and the&#13;
different height of the chairs, et cetera. So it was quite a bit.&#13;
&#13;
But the most interesting study I have ever done, and I still believe that is one of the highlights of&#13;
my professional life, was the study on business travel.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Business travel?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, because the Bank has this enormousâ&#128;&#148;enormous number of business travels. And&#13;
so weâ&#128;&#148; since we were dealing with the Bank MIP in an advisory function, we said, â&#128;&#156;Couldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
we look at the data in terms of utilization of particular services of our own Bank staff?â&#128;&#157; This, in&#13;
itself, created tremendous difficulties because you hadâ&#128;&#148; you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t look at individual records&#13;
like that under the confidentiality agreements, would have been impossible. So we negotiated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
with the insurance company that the data would be coded, became anonymous, would go through&#13;
a third party, and then it could be analyzed. So you had, basically, numbers. You didnâ&#128;&#153;t know&#13;
who . . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Not individuals.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: You could not figure out. That was an enormous difficulty. It took us almost a year to&#13;
get agreement with all the authorities and the confidentiality agreements. But once that system&#13;
was in place, we then could certainly work with this data. And then we looked at stress and the&#13;
business traveler. And we noticed that the consultations for mental health dramatically increased&#13;
with the number of travel days. We published that as a paper [Liese, B., K. A. Mundt, L. D.&#13;
Dell, L. Nagy, B. Demure. â&#128;&#156;Medical Insurance Claims Associated With International Business&#13;
Travel.â&#128;&#157; Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 1997; 54:499-503]. That is a paper which&#13;
has received wide international attention. It is one of the few studies which demonstrated the&#13;
risk of business travel. There were reports in all kinds of publications, The New York Times and&#13;
all over the place it was.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And if anything, I would say travel stress has probably increased. I mean, just in&#13;
my own personal life, I find air travel a lot more onerous these days than say 10, 15 years ago.&#13;
After September 11th, things got dramatically worse.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Much, much more. So I think it would be very interesting to redo this study and see the&#13;
situation today. I think it is a very important study. I would love if the department would&#13;
continue to work in this area.&#13;
&#13;
We had then as well a bigâ&#128;&#148; a big meeting on stress and the business traveler with corporate&#13;
directors of different companies and the airline occupational health directors. And what came&#13;
out is that this is an issue which a lot of people have felt and know about, but which isnâ&#128;&#153;t really&#13;
systemically documented. I have to say that that was one of the highlights professionally.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You did not confine yourself to purely internal matters during your period as&#13;
director of HSD. As you said, you wanted to spend roughly--what--30 percent of your time on&#13;
operational matters.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Later on that was 10 percent, you know, because I didnâ&#128;&#153;t have the time any more.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In 1992 you represented the Bank at the Ministerial Conference on Malaria held in&#13;
Amsterdam convened by the World Health Organization to define a new global strategy for&#13;
malaria control and stimulate new efforts to control malaria around the world. What was your&#13;
particular role in that conference?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I had been working before I came to the department on Brazil, Indonesia and&#13;
Madagascar, as we talked about earlier, in malaria control. And we had basically looked at&#13;
malaria as an occupational disease and had proposed the notion that we should look at patterns of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
disease transmission. So you could have coastal malaria. You could have malaria in areas where&#13;
gold miners were. You could have malaria in rapidly-urbanizing populations, et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
That notion, which is basically a different epidemiological concept, owes its origin to Dr.&#13;
Agostinho Cruz Marques of SUCAM and Dr. JosÃ© A. NÃ¡jera of WHO, and the three of us looked&#13;
at that. We decided to write a Staff Working Paper on patterns and policies in malaria control,&#13;
and that was just ready a year before the conference. Lo and behold, it became the background&#13;
paper on new approaches to malaria control, one of the background materials for the ministerial&#13;
meeting on malaria.&#13;
&#13;
And so I represented the Bank there. Obviously there was a great interest because in the years&#13;
before I had been involved really a lot in malaria control. And it was a very successful meeting.&#13;
It was a very, very important meeting.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The conference defined the four basic elements of the global strategy for malaria&#13;
control as follows: early diagnosis and prompt treatment; implementation of selective,&#13;
sustainable, preventative measures, including vector control; early detection, containment, and&#13;
prevention of epidemics; and fostering regular assessment of affected countriesâ&#128;&#153; malaria&#13;
situation, especially the ecological, social, and economic determinant of the disease by&#13;
strengthening local capacities for basic and applied research.&#13;
&#13;
You coauthored a background paper for the conference which was published as Malaria, New&#13;
Patterns and Perspectives, Technical Paper No. 183. I think this is the one you were just&#13;
referring to.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I found two passages to be of particular interest: â&#128;&#156;At the beginning of the malaria&#13;
eradication program, a major effort was made to train the personnel needed for the program. But&#13;
as programs became staffed, and because malaria was expected to disappear soon, manpower&#13;
resources, especially young professionals and technical staff, became increasingly scarce. It has&#13;
been said that the global malaria eradication program did not eradicate malaria, but did eradicate&#13;
malariologists. Moreover, training for eradication was definitely oriented toward the execution&#13;
of the highly-standardized program, task, and operations. The training of malariologists did not&#13;
give them epidemiological background needed to adapt to changing situations, to solve&#13;
problems, to manage uncertainty, or to adapt or change control approaches and strategy.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
And you write further, â&#128;&#156;Funding for malaria control programs shrank when people began to&#13;
recognize that malaria could not be eradicated, when the basic health services approach to&#13;
developing a health infrastructure did not succeed, and when no successful models developed for&#13;
incorporating malaria control into the primary healthcare strategy. Malaria and general public&#13;
health services exhibited a nearly universal reluctance to define or to redefine their&#13;
responsibilities towards the malaria problem.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                 April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It sounds as if malaria control was in serious trouble. Did the global strategy for malaria control&#13;
formulated at this conference improve the situation with regard to malaria control?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, it did, because it basically provided the official recognition that malaria control&#13;
was in trouble. Before the conference there was a kind of laissez-faire attitude toward malaria&#13;
control. Eradication had failed. We had integrated it into general health services. So why donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
we look the other way? But the data coming from every country in terms of prevalence was that&#13;
malaria was going up, so you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t look the other way. And that conference was, basically,&#13;
the recognition we are in trouble. We have to do something about it. These are the dimensions&#13;
along which we have to go. It did set the stage for the future of malaria control.&#13;
It took another almost five years before the control activities started on a larger scale, almost&#13;
until Ms. [Gro Harlem] Brundtland came to WHO and started the Rollback Malaria Program.&#13;
She institutionalized things. So the follow-up of the conference was relatively slow. On a&#13;
country-by-country basis, plans were made, but the international movement was slow. Five&#13;
years later, it started to gain in momentum. But it was an important historical event.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, weâ&#128;&#153;re now at the point in the interview where we can do some summing up, I&#13;
think. From your perspective, what were the most important lessons learned, both from a&#13;
personal and institutional point of view, during your career at the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, from an institutional point on the project side, on the lending side, I think one of&#13;
the things which Iâ&#128;&#153;ve taken away is that theâ&#128;&#148;in terms of interaction with different cultures, one&#13;
has to develop a great sensitivity and tolerance. And the Lord has given us two ears; therefore, it&#13;
is useful to listen. And heâ&#128;&#153;s only given us one mouth to talk. So maybe one should use two ears&#13;
more than the one mouth. I think it is very important in dealing with different cultures and&#13;
different settings. That is, I think, an important kind of feature of how one should look at the&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
Related to that one is every activity, project, or whatever, what we get involved in needs a local&#13;
sponsor. It needs a constituency, to use a political term. It needs people who are living there&#13;
who want to do that. If you donâ&#128;&#153;t have that, donâ&#128;&#153;t try it. If it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t fit the culture, it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
move. We have seen that in project after project. So you have to have a constituency who really&#13;
wants to do that.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You canâ&#128;&#153;t impose what you think is a good project on an unwilling group, in other&#13;
words.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Right. You can. But it wonâ&#128;&#153;t work. The Bank has quite a few times tried to do that.&#13;
We have often suggested solutions which appeared to be solutions but in reality they didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
really conform to what local values and beliefs are. So I think one has to be humble about the&#13;
development process. That is something which I took away from my years at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
On a personal basis, I think I have learned over time toâ&#128;&#148;Mark Twain said once, â&#128;&#156;I was born&#13;
modest, but it didnâ&#128;&#153;t last long.â&#128;&#157; And I would have to say about myself: I was born modest; it&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t last long. But I had to re-learn modesty at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What do you think have remained the important themes and core activities of the&#13;
Bank in the course of your career?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Well, the focus on poverty which McNamara established I think is still the core of the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work; the lending activities and how we interpret that and how we address it changed&#13;
over time. But the notion that we are in the â&#128;&#156;poverty businessâ&#128;&#157; has remained. Poverty is the&#13;
umbrella; McNamara, basically, erected that umbrella with his Nairobi speech . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, 1973.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: . . right, â&#128;&#153;73. The operational response to poverty was integrated development,&#13;
integrated rural development project infrastructure, agriculture development, irrigation, you&#13;
know, the social sector development. But the definition of poverty has changed now. We&#13;
defined poverty in monetary terms initially, very, very effectively. You know, â&#128;&#156;one dollar a&#13;
day.â&#128;&#157; And then we re-defined it in terms of dealing with basic needs. And then we defined it in&#13;
terms of sector reform. And then we defined it, suddenly, as a glass ceiling, listening to the&#13;
people. So we have over the decades defined poverty in a different way as an institution. We&#13;
could say we have advanced in our definition. I believe so, from a very restrictive definition.&#13;
That has been the core of the Bank, and under this umbrella we have been doing our activity.&#13;
And I thinkâ&#128;&#148;I hope that that will prevail.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What are the values and objectives that you think are necessary to sustain the Bank&#13;
in the future?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I think this focus on poverty, it is a value which the Bank needs to continue. But if you&#13;
look back on the Bank, at least when I came to it, how it has historically developed, you had a&#13;
cadre of what you would call old colonials.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, there is an old joke that the Americans pay for the Bank, the Indians borrow&#13;
from it, and the British run it.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Right. Yes. Theâ&#128;&#148;now you look atâ&#128;&#148;you might look at the term â&#128;&#156;colonial.â&#128;&#157; But Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
looking at the professional competence of these colleagues which were there. We had initially a&#13;
lot of people who had an enormous degree of intellectual integrity and practical field knowledge&#13;
combined with political savvyâ&#128;&#148;what to doâ&#128;&#148;because they had been sitting in positions where it&#13;
was needed.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                 April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: And that very much colored the culture of the Bank. The focus on professional&#13;
competence, and with that professional integrity, that has been a core quality of the Bank. Theâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;m afraid that with the focus on economics as a discipline, the multi-cultural kind of&#13;
professional features of the Bank have been shrinking. They have not been disappearing, but&#13;
they have been shrinking. And if one profession starts to dominate, like the physicians at WHO .&#13;
..&#13;
&#13;
I hope that the value systems will be broad enough in the years to come to still maintain this&#13;
focus on interdisciplinary professional excellence, combined with political savvy.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Bernhard, what did you like most about your career in the Bank, and what did you&#13;
like least?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: If you would ask me what I liked most about the Bank, I would have to say the people,&#13;
the variety of people. It has been absolutely fabulous to work at this place because you have&#13;
many friends and many colleagues who come from very different parts of the world, who speak a&#13;
different language, think differently. And you can work collegiately under the same roof. And&#13;
you learn something. And you become family friends. I have found that fascinating. I think it&#13;
will be very, very hard to find an institution which is similar. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s the reason why I have&#13;
really enjoyed working for the Bank. I wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t trade it off for anything.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, you had the fantastic opportunity to actually shape development on the country side,&#13;
helping people to move ahead. So that isâ&#128;&#148;I consider the project part of the Bank a wonderful&#13;
opportunity as well.&#13;
&#13;
The bureaucracy of the Bank, particularly on the financial legal side of the Bank, as a trust fund&#13;
manager is something that I sometimes wonder about. The Bank has not been effective in&#13;
minimizingâ&#128;&#148;streamlining its own administrative functions, despite many attempts.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Itâ&#128;&#153;s difficult to do, I suspect.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What do you consider to have been your greatest success, and what would you like&#13;
to have done better?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: I thought theâ&#128;&#148;to move the health policy discussion ahead when I came to the Bank so&#13;
that we could actually start lending for health projects, I thought that was a major contribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                  April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And later on, shape the Health Services Department into a functional entity, to build an&#13;
organization.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, that, just in my perception, that was a veryâ&#128;&#148;had a very profound impact on&#13;
the culture of the institution, the internal culture.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which is something that is often ignored, I think, in the history of the Bank. You&#13;
know peopleâ&#128;&#148;and they rightly focus on what the Bank does for the borrowing countries, and&#13;
that, of course, is what it is here for, but that minimizes theâ&#128;&#148;well, letâ&#128;&#153;s put it this way, how the&#13;
Bank is governed internally has a very powerful effect on how it interacts with its clients.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And thatâ&#128;&#148;there is an importance, which I think is often minimized when looking at&#13;
this history of the institution.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: One takes it for granted, yes. But I think the internal servicing is not an easy task. In&#13;
fact, I found it very fascinating.&#13;
&#13;
So these are the two areas where I think I made a contribution. And I think when we started the&#13;
department, the Health Services Department, I should have, in hindsight, much more focused on&#13;
the managerial issues. I was preoccupied at just getting projects moving around.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now when you say managerial issues within the department, you mean . . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Not the Health Services Department; indeed, when we started the PHN department . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: . . and I was deputy division chief, I basically was moving project portfolios ahead. I&#13;
think in hindsight that was actuallyâ&#128;&#148;was actually not the job. I should have really&#13;
systematically looked at how to build that institution, you know, to focus on the managerial side&#13;
of it . .&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: . . which I didnâ&#128;&#153;t because I liked the project side.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And yet, despite that, you did have a profound effect on the evolution of the health&#13;
sector in the Bank and in terms of how the Bank operated in the health sector with regard to its&#13;
borrowing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Bernard H. Liese&#13;
                                   April 9 and 17, 2008â&#128;&#148;Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who were some of the notable personalities that you would care to mention that&#13;
you encountered during your Bank career? I know you mentioned Bilsel. Was there any . . .&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: Bilsel Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always admired for his diplomacy and competence and dedication. And I&#13;
liked Shahid Husain as well.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Not everybody would say that.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: No, I know that, you know. He was sometimes not easy to work with, but I got along&#13;
with him well in his own right.&#13;
&#13;
Bob McNamara was a fantastic leader. And I have to say that the president, which is often&#13;
underestimated, I feel, because he was so short here, Lew [Lewis T.] Preston. With Bilsel, we&#13;
had quite a bit of contact with him and, boy, was he a competent manager in terms of&#13;
understanding managerial dimensions that I really felt he was a very, very effective person.&#13;
Later on Jim Wolfensohn came, who was with us in the Health Services Department, as you well&#13;
know, always charming and supportive and helpful. And so there areâ&#128;&#148;these were the upper&#13;
lines.&#13;
&#13;
And then one person which I have truly admired as well, Shengman.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Shengman Zhang, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: He basically kept the Bank together, moved it ahead, pushed it. And obviously before&#13;
that, but I had much less contact with him, was Ernie Stern. So there are really interesting&#13;
people, and you could go on the division level or at the collegial level.&#13;
&#13;
Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a whole list of people who come to mind, you know, in our own area: Nancy Birdsall&#13;
and Kanagaratnam. So itâ&#128;&#153;s hard to figure them out.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes. Is there anything finally that we havenâ&#128;&#153;t covered that you would like to&#13;
discuss?&#13;
&#13;
LIESE: No, not really. It has been fun. And thanks very much, Chuck.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, thank you for participating in the Oral History Program, Bernhard.&#13;
