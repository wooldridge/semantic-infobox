&amp;#12;2008   WORLD DEVELOPMENT&#13;
       INDICATORS&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;PREFACE&#13;
Release of the final report of the International Comparison Program (ICP) and publication of new estimates of purchas-&#13;
ing power parities (PPPs) in World Development Indicators 2008 are an important statistical milestone. The estimates&#13;
offer a consistent and comprehensive set of data on the cost of living in developed and developing countries, the first&#13;
since 1997, when the results of the previous ICP data collection were published in World Development Indicators. The&#13;
2005 data cover 146 countries and territories, 29 more than the last round in 1993--and many for the first time.&#13;
&#13;
Collecting data on thousands of products sold through a multitude of outlets, the 2005 ICP is the largest international&#13;
statistical program ever undertaken. New methods were used to describe the products being priced, record the data,&#13;
and analyze the results. Countries in Africa took the opportunity to review their national accounts and adopt new stan-&#13;
dards and methods. In all regions regional coordinators worked closely with national statistical offices to collect and&#13;
validate the data. The result is a genuine global effort, with an extensive capacity building component.&#13;
&#13;
More work will follow from the ICP. First is the revision of the international ($1 a day) poverty line and estimation of the&#13;
corresponding poverty rates, certain to change our view of the absolute level of poverty in the world. PPPs have many&#13;
applications in economic analysis. They are used to determine the relative size of countries and their obligations to&#13;
international institutions. The publication of new estimates will inspire a new wave of academic studies. And as all of&#13;
this work goes on, planning for the next round of the ICP will be getting under way.&#13;
&#13;
There is much of interest in this year's World Development Indicators besides the ICP results. The Millennium Develop-&#13;
ment Goal targets have been expanded to include new ones for reproductive health, protection of biodiversity, access&#13;
to treatment for HIV/AIDS, and full and productive employment and decent work for all. Measuring the associated&#13;
indicators consistently and reporting on progress pose new challenges for statisticians. The World Development Indi-&#13;
cators database includes as many of these indicators as possible. The introduction to the People section looks at the&#13;
importance of reproductive health for the well-being of women and children. The Environment section considers today's&#13;
great environmental challenge: climate change.&#13;
&#13;
Governance--the performance of public officials and the quality of government institutions--has long been recognized&#13;
as an important determinant of development success. But to understand how governance, good or bad, affects devel-&#13;
opment, it must be measured. And to provide guidance for improved performance, it must be measured in ways that&#13;
are sensible to politicians, citizens, and others responsible for improving governance. The States and Markets section&#13;
discusses how to measure governance and the problems frequently encountered in doing so. The tables provide a&#13;
selection of governance indicators and other measures of the interaction of states and markets.&#13;
&#13;
World Development Indicators remains a rich source of information on the world's people, their economies, and the&#13;
environment. To make it more useful, we have expanded the Primary data documentation section. As always, we could&#13;
not bring it to you without the help of our many partners and the work of hundreds of thousands of statisticians and&#13;
others in developed and developing countries who gather the primary data on which these statistics are based.&#13;

Defining, gathering, and disseminating international statistics is a collective effort of many people and organiza-&#13;
tions. The indicators presented in World Development Indicators are the fruit of decades of work at many levels,&#13;
from the field workers who administer censuses and household surveys to the committees and working parties&#13;
of the national and international statistical agencies that develop the nomenclature, classifications, and stan-&#13;
dards fundamental to an international statistical system. Nongovernmental organizations and the private sector&#13;
have also made important contributions, both in gathering primary data and in organizing and publishing their&#13;
results. And academic researchers have played a crucial role in developing statistical methods and carrying on&#13;
a continuing dialogue about the quality and interpretation of statistical indicators. All these contributors have a&#13;
strong belief that available, accurate data will improve the quality of public and private decisionmaking.&#13;
    The organizations listed here have made World Development Indicators possible by sharing their data and&#13;
their expertise with us. More important, their collaboration contributes to the World Bank's efforts, and to those&#13;
of many others, to improve the quality of life of the world's people. We acknowledge our debt and gratitude to all&#13;
who have helped to build a base of comprehensive, quantitative information about the world and its people.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               V     iewing the world at purchasing power parity&#13;
                      Comparable measures of economic activity and living standards are useful for many&#13;
               purposes. Foreign investors, traders, and potential immigrants want to know an economy's&#13;
               market size, productivity, and prices. The globalization of markets for goods, services, finance,&#13;
               labor, and ideas reinforces the interdependence of economies and the need to measure them&#13;
               on a common scale. Countries cannot share responsibilities for global public goods--the&#13;
               environment, security, development assistance, and global governance--without meaningful&#13;
               assessments of the real size of their economies and the well-being of their people.&#13;
&#13;
               But comparing the real size of economies is not easy. Even in an integrated global economy&#13;
               large differences in the costs of goods and services persist. Exchange rates can be used to&#13;
               convert values in one currency to another, but since they do not fully reflect differences in&#13;
               price levels they cannot measure the real volume of output. Exchange rates are determined&#13;
               by the demand for and supply of currencies used in international transactions, ignoring&#13;
               domestic economic sectors where prices are set in relative isolation from the rest of the&#13;
               world. Thus the familiar experience of international travelers, who discover that they can buy&#13;
               more, or less, of the same goods in different countries when converting their money using&#13;
               the prevailing exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
               To measure the real size of the world's economy and to compare costs of living across coun-&#13;
               tries, we need to adjust for differences in purchasing power. Finding a way to adjust for those&#13;
               differences has given rise to the efforts to measure purchasing power parties (PPPs), which&#13;
               convert local currencies to a common currency, such as the U.S. dollar.&#13;
&#13;
               Since 1970 the International Comparison Program (ICP) has conducted eight rounds of PPP&#13;
               estimates for the major components of countries' gross domestic product (GDP)--the most&#13;
               recent for 2005. The PPP process calls for the systematic collection of price data on hundreds&#13;
               of representative and carefully defined products and services consumed in each country, requir-&#13;
               ing the full cooperation of national statistical agencies and international organizations.&#13;
&#13;
               High-income countries regularly take part in such programs, but 2005 was the first time&#13;
               since 1993 that comprehensive price surveys were carried out in developing economies. An&#13;
               unprecedented number, 101, took part. These new PPPs provide a better and more complete&#13;
               view of the world economy. They show that in 2005 developing country economies were on&#13;
               average 2.2 times larger when measured by PPPs than by exchange rates. They also reveal&#13;
               that past estimates of the real size of the economies of developing countries based on the&#13;
               1993 ICP round were often too large.&#13;
&#13;
               This section reports the major findings of the 2005 ICP round and explores some of the&#13;
               implications. In doing so, it aims to provide a better picture of today's important issues,&#13;
               highlighting the diversity--and the commonality--of development patterns and outcomes.&#13;

    The eighth round of the ICP included 146 economies--101 of                           Purchasing power parities are needed because similar goods&#13;
    them classified by the World Bank as low and middle income                           and services have widely varying prices across countries when&#13;

    rates--covering more than 95 percent of the world's people                           Differences are greatest in sectors not commonly traded in-&#13;
    (figure 1a). This was the first global price collection since 1993,                  ternationally, such as housing, construction, and health and&#13;
    although some European economies have carried out regular                            education services (figure 1c). Price differences are smaller for&#13;
    price comparisons, the last in 2002. Some large economies,                           widely traded products, such as machinery and equipment, af-&#13;
    such as China, and many smaller ones in Africa, took part for                        ter allowing for taxes, distributor margins, and transport costs.&#13;
    the first time. India took part for the first time since 1985.                       PPPs include the prices of tradable and nontradable goods, us-&#13;
        Noteworthy is that the two poorest developing regions,                           ing weights that reflect their relative importance in total GDP.&#13;
    South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, have the best population                              Comparing prices across economies is complicated by ten-&#13;
    coverage--more than 98 percent (figure 1b). Latin America and                        sion between comparability and representativeness. Goods and&#13;
    the Caribbean and the Middle East and North Africa recorded                          services should have similar characteristics (comparable) and&#13;
    less coverage, both below 87 percent. Caribbean countries and                        be consumed everywhere (representative). To compensate for&#13;
    Algeria, Libya, and West Bank and Gaza did not participate in                        noncomparability of representative products, the ICP conducted&#13;
    the 2005 round. Many fragile and conflict-beset states were                          parallel programs: selecting items at the regional level, where&#13;
    underrepresented (with coverage around 50 percent), with weak                        consumption patterns are broadly similar across countries, and&#13;
    statistical capacity and conditions inimical to data collection.                     selecting items for global comparison among a few countries&#13;
        The new ICP round, with its expanded coverage, provides                          from each region. The results of the second program were used&#13;

The Millennium Development Goals and targets come from the Millennium Declaration, signed by 189 countries, including 147 heads of state and government, in September 2000 (www.&#13;
un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.htm) as updated by the 60th UN General Assembly in September 2005. The revised Millennium Development Goal (MDG) monitoring framework&#13;
shown here, including new targets and indicators, was presented to the 62nd General Assembly, with new numbering as recommended by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on MDG&#13;
Indicators at its 12th meeting on 14 November 2007. The goals and targets are interrelated and should be seen as a whole. They represent a partnership between the developed countries&#13;
and the developing countries "to create an environment--at the national and global levels alike--which is conducive to development and the elimination of poverty." All indicators should be&#13;
disaggregated by sex and urban-rural location as far as possible.&#13;

                                                      Keeping mothers alive and healthy is good for women, their families, and society.&#13;
                                               Prioritizing women's health will help countries meet many of the Millennium Development&#13;
                                               Goals--first improved maternal and child health, then reduced poverty, universal education,&#13;
                                               and gender equality. Poor people tend to have large families, suffer disproportionately from&#13;
                                               illness, and use fewer health services during pregnancy and childbirth. Reproductive health&#13;
                                               care can enhance poor people's overall health care and help families escape the poverty&#13;
                                               impact of having many children. When financial resources are divided among fewer family&#13;
                                               members, more is left for education, health care, and savings, decreasing vulnerability and&#13;

&#13;
                                               This important link between reproductive health and development outcomes was first articu-&#13;
                                               lated in 1994 at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. But&#13;
                                               as fertility declined in many countries and new priorities arose, reproductive health and fam-&#13;
                                               ily planning fell steadily in international priority. Complicating this was the lack of sectoral&#13;
                                               ownership of reproductive health and the requirement for multisectoral action.&#13;
&#13;
                                               The targets for the Millennium Development Goals, drafted in 2000, ignored the overarching&#13;
                                               Cairo goal of universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, instead focusing&#13;
                                               on the target of reducing maternal mortality, a problem of immense magnitude in poor coun-&#13;
                                               tries (figures 2a and 2b). Millennium Development Goal 5 in 2000 identified two indicators to&#13;
                                               measure progress: maternal mortality ratios and the proportion of births attended by skilled&#13;
                                               staff. At an analytical level, however, it is impossible to disentangle maternal health from&#13;
                                               reproductive health, of which maternal health is just one facet.&#13;

  Socioeconomic status as displayed in the table is&#13;
based on a household's assets, including ownership&#13;
of consumer items, features of the household's dwell-&#13;
ing, and other characteristics related to wealth. Each&#13;
household asset on which information was collected&#13;
was assigned a weight generated through principal-&#13;
component analysis. The resulting scores were stan-&#13;
dardized in relation to a standard normal distribution&#13;
with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.&#13;
The standardized scores were then used to create&#13;
break-points defining wealth quintiles, expressed as&#13;
quintiles of individuals in the population.&#13;
  The choice of the asset index for defining socio-&#13;
economic status was based on pragmatic rather than&#13;
conceptual considerations: Demographic and Health&#13;
Surveys do not collect income or consumption data&#13;
but do have detailed information on households' own-&#13;
ership of consumer goods and access to a variety&#13;
of goods and services. Like income or consumption,&#13;
the asset index defines disparities primarily in eco-&#13;
nomic terms. It therefore excludes other possibilities&#13;

               Numbers tell the story. The natural climate has changed, and the change is accelerating as&#13;
               our planet warms. The rate of warming has been nearly twice as fast in the last 50 years&#13;
               as in the last 100 years, with the 13 warmest years since 1880 experienced in the last 15&#13;
               years. Since 1978 annual mean arctic sea ice has been declining. Temperatures at the top&#13;
               of the permafrost have increased by up to 3 degrees centigrade. Sea levels rose more from&#13;
               1993 to 2003 than in the previous 30 years. Concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide,&#13;
               the main cause of global warming, increased one-third faster in the last decade than over the&#13;
               last 50 years (IPCC 2007a).&#13;
&#13;
               Climate change poses risks for the environment and for development in most economies,&#13;
               disproportionately affecting those with the lowest capacity to adapt to such impacts. That&#13;
               makes climate change a development issue critical to poverty reduction. It is also an envi-&#13;
               ronmental issue vital to sustaining growth and preserving the ecosystem. Countries need&#13;
               measures to mitigate it--and to adapt to its unavoidable outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
               Knowledge about climate change has grown greatly in the last few years. The most compre-&#13;
               hensive treatment is in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on&#13;
               Climate Change (IPCC), which presents the findings of hundreds of experts in the field:&#13;
&#13;
               ·     All greenhouse gas concentrations--the main causes of climate change--have increased&#13;
                     since the start of the industrial revolution. From 1750 to 2005 carbon dioxide grew from&#13;
                     280 parts per million to 379, methane from 715 parts per billion to 1,774, and nitrous&#13;
                     oxide from 270 parts per billion to 319.&#13;
               ·     Warming of the climate system is unequivocal--now evident in global averages of air,&#13;
                     surface, and ocean temperatures; in widespread melting of snow and ice; and in rising&#13;
                     global mean sea level.&#13;
               ·     The likely consequences of climate change are uneven across regions, with more profound&#13;
                     negative impacts for developing countries and for more vulnerable socioeconomic groups.&#13;
               ·     It is very likely (90+ percent confidence) that human activities are causing global warming.&#13;
               ·     Changes in technology, management, and behavior can mitigate climate change.&#13;
               ·     Even with mitigation, climate change will continue, and adaptation will be needed.&#13;

  gas emissions have drastically increased since preindustrial                                growth (67 percent) and population growth (73 percent).&#13;

  More than 75 percent of these emissions come from carbon                                    substantially, with the United States and China contributing&#13;

   What is rural? Urban?                                                                                3.1a&#13;
&#13;
  The rural population identified in table 3.1 is approximated as the difference between total population and&#13;
  urban population, calculated using the urban share reported by the United Nations Population Division.&#13;
  There is no universal standard for distinguishing rural from urban areas, and any urban-rural dichotomy is&#13;
  an oversimplification (see About the data for table 3.11). The two distinct images--isolated farm, thriving&#13;
  metropolis--represent poles on a continuum. Life changes along a variety of dimensions, moving from the&#13;
  most remote forest outpost through fields and pastures, past tiny hamlets, through small towns with weekly&#13;
  farm markets, into intensively cultivated areas near large towns and small cities, eventually reaching the&#13;
  center of a megacity. Along the way access to infrastructure, social services, and nonfarm employment&#13;
  increase, and with them population density and income. Because rurality has many dimensions, for policy&#13;
  purposes the rural-urban dichotomy presented in tables 3.1 and 3.11 is inadequate.&#13;
    A recent World Bank Policy Research Paper proposes an operational definition of rurality based on&#13;
  population density and distance to large cities (Chomitz, Buys, and Thomas 2005). The report argues&#13;
                                                                                                                    Data sources&#13;

BOD measures the strength of an organic waste by&#13;

A sewage overload in natural waters exhausts the&#13;

&#13;
               A       portrait of the global economy&#13;
                     The world's output grew 4.8 percent in 2006, half a percentage point faster than in&#13;
               2005, to reach nearly $59 trillion. That was an increase of almost 50 percent since 1995,&#13;
               measured in purchasing power parity and 2005 prices (figure 4a). Low- and middle-income&#13;
               economies--whose share of global output increased from 34 percent to 41 percent--grew&#13;
               faster on average than high-income economies. Setting the pace were East Asia and Pacific,&#13;
               whose developing economies more than doubled their output and increased their share of&#13;
               global output from 9 percent to 14 percent, and South Asia, whose share increased from&#13;
               4 percent to 6 percent. Dominating the growth in these two regions were China and India.&#13;
               Growing less rapidly, Europe and Central Asia gained a percentage point, Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
               and the Middle East and North Africa saw their shares stay the same, while Latin America&#13;
               and the Caribbean saw its share of global output decline from 9 percent to 8 percent.&#13;
&#13;
               The statistics in this section measure the size and structure of the world's economies and&#13;
               how they are managed. The national accounts record the sources of economic growth. The&#13;
               balance of payments tracks the flow of goods and services between countries. The fiscal and&#13;
               monetary accounts, interest rates, and exchange rates reflect the domestic and international&#13;
               forces acting on the economy and the responses of politicians and policymakers.&#13;
&#13;
               Viewed over time, macroeconomic statistics show the health of an economy and the quality&#13;
               of macroeconomic management. Viewed across countries, they reveal the many varied pat-&#13;
               terns of development. Together they inform citizens, businesses, and governments of the&#13;
               results of their efforts and guide them in their future choices.&#13;

               M           easuring governance&#13;
                        The breakup of the Soviet Union and the emergence of democracies in many develop-&#13;
               ing countries have increased interest in governance. Good governance, strong institutions, and&#13;
               control of corruption are important for development success. Failures of the state can negate&#13;
               development gains, particularly in low-income economies, many of them fragile states.&#13;
&#13;
               Improvements in data and econometric techniques have permitted large cross-country stud-&#13;
               ies on the impact of governance and institutions on investment and growth. This research has&#13;
               produced strong evidence that the quality of governance has a big impact on economic growth,&#13;
               a relationship that is robust over time and across countries (figure 5a). It shows that corruption&#13;
               discourages private investment and distorts resource allocation in ways that hurt the poor.&#13;
               Research also finds that public spending to expand primary education and reduce child and&#13;
               infant mortality produces more benefits in countries with less corruption. And it finds that good&#13;
               governance in a country increases the likelihood of development projects succeeding.&#13;
&#13;
               The World Bank defines governance as the way public officials and institutions acquire and&#13;
               exercise authority to provide public goods and services, including education, health care, infra-&#13;
               structure, and a sound investment climate. Bad governance is often equated with corruption.&#13;
               But the concepts, while related, are different. Corruption, the abuse of public office for private&#13;
               gain, is an outcome of poor governance, reflecting the breakdown of accountability. Fighting&#13;
               corruption requires addressing underlying failures of governance.&#13;
&#13;
               As citizens, investors, policymakers, and donors become more aware of the importance of good&#13;
               governance to development, they increasingly demand information that better tracks progress and&#13;
               increases the transparency of public sector management and anticorruption programs (box 5b). The&#13;
               growing interest in the quality of governance has driven what a recent Organisation for Economic&#13;

 Countries' scores on the Worldwide Governance Indicators aggregate indicator of government effectiveness are shown in rank order. The error bars show a 90 percent confidence&#13;
 interval around each score. Because of measurement error, differences in scores cannot be determined with certainty. In this example the scores of the 46 countries in the&#13;
 middle of the distribution cannot be determined to be significantly above or below the median value.&#13;

&amp;#12;GLOBAL LINKS&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               T     he world economy expands and economies grow closer&#13;
                      Economic integration is the widening and deepening of the ties that link national&#13;
               economies. Trade, finance, movement of people, and transportation and communication&#13;
               infrastructure are the mechanisms. But integration is not a simple or certain process. Politi-&#13;
               cal and cultural connections underpin economic alliances. Geography may pose obstacles&#13;
               to integration, while technology can overcome them.&#13;
&#13;
               The past two decades have seen an enormous increase in the size of the global economy and&#13;
               of the economic ties between countries. Between 1990 and 2006 East Asia and Pacific's&#13;
               trade increased from 47 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to 87 percent, and&#13;
               gross private capital flows from international sources increased from 7 percent of GDP to&#13;
               11 percent. In Sub-Saharan Africa trade within the region and with the rest of the world&#13;
               increased from 52 percent of GDP to 72 percent, and gross private capital flows rose from&#13;
               12 percent to 14 percent. Evidence of integration? Yes, but the two regions have had much&#13;
               different experiences. Each had about 3.5 percent of global exports in 1980, but by 2006&#13;
               East Asia and Pacific's share had grown to 10.8 percent while Sub-Saharan Africa's had&#13;
               fallen to 1.9 percent.&#13;
&#13;
               As global integration proceeds, developing countries are likely to expand their share of the&#13;
               global economy, especially regional centers with large populations and a significant economic&#13;
               base, such as Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation, and South Africa. But even small&#13;
               and remote economies can take part. Better air and ocean transport gets products to mar-&#13;
               kets faster and with more precise timing. Better transportation has been complemented by&#13;
               improvements in technology and favorable regulatory environments, reducing the costs of&#13;
               global communication, information dissemination, and management of economic activities.&#13;
               But as Dollar (2005, p. 148) notes, "As in previous waves of integration . . . change is driven&#13;
               partly by technological advances in transport and communications and partly by deliberate&#13;
               policy choices." Integration does not happen automatically.&#13;
&#13;
               All developing countries have the potential to gain from an integrated global environment.&#13;
               Like all economic forces, global integration may produce winners and losers. To realize the&#13;
               benefits of integration, countries need the capacity to absorb new technologies, use capital&#13;
               productively, and increase their labor force's knowledge and skills. Countries do not start&#13;
               with the same endowments--and wars, political divisions, and plain bad luck may blight their&#13;
               opportunities. The challenge is to ensure sustainable and widely shared growth.&#13;
&#13;
               Monitoring the development of global links provides the underpinning for policies aimed at&#13;
               managing challenges and aiding integration that is inclusive for all. The data in this section&#13;
               provide a snapshot of the world's integration and and a framework for measuring it.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;PRIMARY DATA DOCUMENTATION&#13;
The World Bank is not a primary data collection agency for most areas other than&#13;
business and investment climate surveys, living standards surveys, and external&#13;
debt. As a major user of socioeconomic data, however, the World Bank recog-&#13;
nizes the importance of data documentation to inform users of differences in&#13;
the methods and conventions used by primary data collectors--usually national&#13;
statistical agencies, central banks, and customs services--and by international&#13;
organizations, which compile the statistics that appear in the World Development&#13;
Indicators database. These differences may give rise to significant discrepancies&#13;
over time both within countries and across them. Delays in reporting data and&#13;
the use of old surveys as the base for current estimates may further compromise&#13;
the quality of data reported here.&#13;
    The tables in this section provide information on sources, methods, and&#13;
reporting standards of the principal demographic, economic, and environmental&#13;
indicators in World Development Indicators. Additional documentation is avail-&#13;
able from the World Bank's Country Statistical Information Database at www.&#13;
worldbank.org/data.&#13;
    The demand for good quality statistical data is increasing. Timely and reliable&#13;
statistics are key to the broad development strategy often referred to as "manag-&#13;
ing for results." Monitoring and reporting on publicly agreed indicators are central&#13;
to implementing poverty reduction strategies and lie at the heart of the Millen-&#13;
nium Development Goals and the new Results Measurement System adopted for&#13;
the 14th replenishment of the International Development Association.&#13;
    A global action plan to improve national and international statistics was&#13;
agreed on during the Second Roundtable on Managing for Development Results&#13;
in February 2004 in Marrakech, Morocco. The plan, now referred to as the Mar-&#13;
rakech Action Plan for Statistics, or MAPS, has been widely endorsed and forms&#13;
the overarching framework for statistical capacity building. The third roundtable&#13;
conference, held in February 2007 in Hanoi, Vietnam, reaffirmed MAPS as the&#13;
guiding strategy for improving the capacity of the national and international sta-&#13;
tistical systems. See www.mfdr.org/RT3 for reports from the conference.&#13;

            Release of the final report of the
            International Comparison Program (ICP) and publication of
            new estimates of purchasing power parities (PPPs) in World
            Development Indicators 2008 are an important statistical
            milestone. The estimates offer a consistent and
            comprehensive set of data on the cost of living in developed
            and developing countries, the first since 1997, when the
            results of the previous ICP data collection were published
            in World Development Indicators. The 2005 data cover 146
            countries and territories, 29 more than the last round in
            1993, and many for the first time. Collecting data on
            thousands of products sold through a multitude of outlets,
            the 2005 ICP is the largest international statistical
            program ever undertaken. New methods were used to describe
            the products being priced, record the data, and analyze the
            results. Countries in Africa took the opportunity to review
            their national accounts and adopt new standards and methods.
            In all regions regional coordinators worked closely with
            national statistical offices to collect and validate the
            data. The result is a genuine global effort, with an
            extensive capacity building component. More work will follow
            from the ICP. First is the revision of the international ($1
            a day) poverty line and estimation of the corresponding
            poverty rates, certain to change a view of the absolute
            level of poverty in the world. PPPs have many applications
            in economic analysis. They are used to determine the
            relative size of countries and their obligations to
            international institutions. The publication of new estimates
            will inspire a new wave of academic studies. And as all of
            this work goes on, planning for the next round of the ICP
            will be getting under way.
