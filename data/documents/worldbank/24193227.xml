Introduction&#13;
This report provides a survey of the key features associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring,&#13;
reporting, and verification (MRV) systems that support the pilot emissions trading schemes (ETS) in&#13;
China. The seven pilots are&#13;
&#13;
    1.   Beijing,&#13;
    2.   Chongqing,&#13;
    3.   Guangdong,&#13;
    4.   Hubei,&#13;
    5.   Shanghai,&#13;
    6.   Shenzhen, and&#13;
    7.   Tianjin.&#13;
&#13;
The seven pilots have successfully launched. The pilot cities/provinces are different in terms of&#13;
economic structure and development, and the corresponding MRV systems reflect the specific needs of&#13;
each pilot ETS. Sectors covered by the ETS pilots are based on their respective economies and the&#13;
emission profile of the province. The threshold for determining covered enterprises is also based on the&#13;
same standard. Provinces with industry-driven economies cover heavy industries and other large&#13;
companies, while provinces with service sector-driven economy cover fewer heavy industries and more&#13;
service sector enterprises and the threshold is set smaller.&#13;
&#13;
The GHG accounting methodologies of the seven pilots do have several similar features. For example,&#13;
companies can choose to quantify their emission via either calculation-based or measurement-based&#13;
methods, except for Tianjin and Chongqing, which do not include measurement-based approaches. A&#13;
Key decision among the pilots is whether to include mobile source and what type of indirect emission to&#13;
account for and report. Beijing and Guangdong pilot exclude mobile source. All of the pilots account for&#13;
CO2 emissions from electricity consumption, but only Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenzhen and Guangdong&#13;
consider heat consumption. Regarding data requirements for the calculation methods, all pilots provide&#13;
the option of using measured or default values for emission factors. However, the requirement and&#13;
frequency for measured values is different from pilot to pilot. The verification processes in the pilots are&#13;
similar to each other, too, although described in various details.&#13;
&#13;
This report has the following structure. (1) It begins with an overview of each ETS, to provide context for&#13;
the MRV systems of the pilots. (2) The second part includes a summary table of the attributes of the&#13;
MRV systems for all the pilots. (3) The report concludes with observations about the similarities and&#13;
differences of the MRV systems for the pilots as well as the published rules and procedures for the&#13;
national MRV system. The technical challenges for developing the MRV are also identified. Practical&#13;
aspects of the determination of boundaries, development of methodology, acquisition of activity data,&#13;
emission factors and evidence for cross check are discussed. Engagement of stakeholders, capacity&#13;
building and supporting institutions are also explored, as well as lessons learned.&#13;

Observations about Similarities and Differences among the MRV Systems&#13;
China has not launched the national ETS, but has published the monitoring and reporting guidelines&#13;
(MRG) for 10 sectors at the national level. The information of Chongqing ETS pilot is largely not yet&#13;
published at the moment, thus the national MR guidelines as well as MR guidelines in the pilot ETS (with&#13;
available information of Chongqing) will be discussed in this chapter.&#13;
&#13;
Covered sectors&#13;
Ideally, all significant emitters and all relevant emission sources should be covered by the ETS, but in&#13;
order to reduce the operating cost of ETS normally only large emitters are controlled under the scheme.&#13;
The national MR guidelines includes 10 sectors, power generation, power transmission and distribution,&#13;
aviation, cement, ceramics, flat glass, electrolytic aluminum, magnesium smelting, chemical and iron &amp;&#13;
steel. The ETS pilots choose which sectors to regulate according to their emission level and feasibility of&#13;
being monitored, reported and verified.&#13;
Given that the covered sectors of Chongqing pilot are not published yet, this section will only address&#13;
the remaining six sectors. Power and chemical sector is the only sector covered by all pilots, followed&#13;
iron &amp; steel sector covered by four out of six pilots. Heat, refinery, cement and paper industries are&#13;
covered by half of the pilots while textile and non-ferrous metal industries are covered by two pilots.&#13;
Hubei Provinceâ&#128;&#153;s economy builds on large portion of industrial sectors, which consists of considerable&#13;
number of large-scale industrial sectors. The Hubei pilot therefore includes 11 industrial sectors, such as&#13;
power, iron and steel, alloy, ammonia and so on.&#13;
Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen are cities with large service sectors and a relatively small portion of&#13;
industries. These pilots also regulate service sectors besides industries. Beijing and Shanghai pilots&#13;
include various service sectors while Shenzhen regulate large buildings.&#13;
Similarly, the national MRG set out accounting methodologies for power sectors, energy intensive&#13;
industries and civil aviation. The MRG series is still in development, more sectors will be covered in the&#13;
coming years.&#13;
&#13;
Threshold for included enterprises&#13;
Accounting and reporting of GHG emissions is still at the beginning stage, and is a key component of all&#13;
climate change related policy making. Therefore, some pilots (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and&#13;
Guangdong) set a two-level threshold for determining covered entities, consisting of a reporting only&#13;
threshold and a compliance threshold which requires emitters to report emission and submit&#13;
commensurate allowances respectively.&#13;
Emission threshold may be based on GHG emission, energy consumption or both of the two. Tianjin,&#13;
Shanghai and Shenzhen stipulate the threshold with GHG emissions, while Hubei uses energy&#13;
consumption. In the Beijing and Guangdong pilots, if either GHG emission and energy consumption&#13;
threshold is triggered, the enterprises will need to report to the competent authority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          10&#13;
&amp;#12;PMR Technical Note 8 (July 2014)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Shenzhen is the only pilot covering buildings as a sole group. Buildings with area exceeding a specified&#13;
threshold need to report to the competent authority.&#13;
Hubei has set a distinct compliance threshold of 60000 tons of coal-equivalent, which is above the&#13;
thresholds of other pilots. Although a reporting threshold for emission reporting only is mentioned in&#13;
the work plan, the threshold has not yet published at the moment.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting boundary&#13;
Unlike the EU ETS, in which the accounting boundary is based on the installation level, the accounting&#13;
boundaries for pilot ETS and national ETS are more based on the legal person, which means every&#13;
emission source associated with the company should be reported by the company, with only Guangdong&#13;
and Shenzhen ETS based on the organization boundary.&#13;
International MR standards such as ISO 14064 and WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol determine accounting&#13;
boundary based on organizational and operational boundaries, and the MR guidelines of Guangdong&#13;
and Shenzhen pilots are formulated according to ISO standards.&#13;
The legal person-based boundary has some advantages for China. For one hand, this kind of boundary is&#13;
the same with the requirements for energy statistics; for another, it is easy to accumulate the data on&#13;
the enterprise level for some sectors, while difficult to collect data on the installation level.&#13;
All the MR guidelines require enterprises to report emission related to production and operating&#13;
activities save Shenzhen â&#128;&#147; this issue is not specified in its guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Emission sources&#13;
Enterprises in all the pilots and future national ETS would need to report both direct and indirect&#13;
emissions, but the MR guidelines vary regarding to specific emission sources. Emission sources that are&#13;
common to all the MR systems include stationary fossil fuel combustion, process emissions and&#13;
electricity consumption.&#13;
Emissions from waste treatment need to be addressed in the Beijing and Guangdong pilots. According to&#13;
Beijing and Guangdongâ&#128;&#153;s MR guidelines, direct emission from mobile source is excluded even if it is&#13;
within the accounting boundary. There are different kinds of indirect emission, like electricity&#13;
consumption and heat consumption. Although all MR guidelines in China accounts for indirect emission,&#13;
Beijing and Hubei pilot only takes into account of emissions from electricity consumption, while other&#13;
four pilots require to report emissions from heating as well.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring Methodology&#13;
In accordance with the national and pilot MR guidelines, the accounting of GHG emissions relies on&#13;
calculation-based methodologies, which may be an emission factor approach or mass balance.&#13;
Measurement-based methodology could be used in some pilots, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hubei,&#13;
Guangdong and Shenzhen. However, in the national MR guidelines, only the calculation-based&#13;
methodology can be applied.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                           11&#13;
&amp;#12;PMR Technical Note 8 (July 2014)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data Requirements&#13;
As to data requirement, there are two approaches for regulating data acquisition. The first one is to&#13;
stipulate in details about the data source, measurement frequency and measurement standard. This&#13;
approach is adopted by all MR systems except for Shenzhen.&#13;
For the first approach, fuel consumption is derived from energy consumption account or statistics.&#13;
According to the national GHG accounting and reporting guideline as well as Beijing, Tianjin pilots,&#13;
enterprises of the power sector should test the NCV, while default values can be used for other sectors.&#13;
For most pilots and the national guideline, carbon content and the oxidation factors can refer to&#13;
measured or default values. When accounting indirect emissions, the requirements in all the pilots and&#13;
the national guidelines are similar, activity data comes from receipts or invoices and emission factors&#13;
supplied by default values in the guidelines.&#13;
The second approach, which is adopted by Shenzhen, sets out different levels for activity data and&#13;
emission factor acquisition. Instead of restricting data requirement, this approach encourages the use of&#13;
higher level data with lower uncertainty. When lower level data is used, a statement explaining the&#13;
reason should be sent to the competent authority. Guangdong pilot combines the two approaches. Tiers&#13;
are set out in the guideline, as well as the measurement requirements and frequency. Companies are&#13;
encouraged to use the tiers with high certainty. When measurement of parameters are not possible,&#13;
default values could be applied.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring Plan&#13;
Not all the MR guidelines integrate a monitoring plan. Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong and Hubei pilots&#13;
require enterprises to submit a monitoring plan to describe monitoring approaches, with slight&#13;
differences of the content of monitoring plan. The plans include general information of the enterprises,&#13;
methodology choice, parameters monitoring frequency and method. Some of the plans include other&#13;
requirements as well, such as data management, uncertainties, among other items.&#13;
&#13;
Quality assurance and control&#13;
Development and improvement of the data management system stands at the core of the quality&#13;
assurance and control. Every MR guideline provides relevant provisions to standardized data collection,&#13;
processing and archive. Establishing a dedicated department with competent personnel also appears in&#13;
several of the MR guidelines. Besides the personnel and data management, there are some other issues&#13;
raised in the some of the guidelines. For example, Tianjin emphasize training program for relevant staff&#13;
and internal review for GHG accounting. Hubei pilot adopts the DB42/T 727-2011 (Implementation&#13;
guidelines for quantification, verification, reporting and modification of GHG emissions) for conducting&#13;
data quality analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Uncertainty analysis&#13;
The national MR guidelines do not specified requirements regarding uncertainty analysis, but all other&#13;
pilots, except for Hubei and Chongqing of which the details are not published, include uncertainty&#13;
analysis as part of the guidelines. In analyzing uncertainty, there are two types of analysis, qualitative&#13;
and quantitative. The Shenzhen pilot describes both methods in the guideline. Others require only one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         12&#13;
&amp;#12;PMR Technical Note 8 (July 2014)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
type of analysis. Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong require quantitative method (mainly the error&#13;
propagation method), while enterprises in Tianjin need to describe uncertainty in relation to monitoring&#13;
accuracy, use of default value, missing data, misuse of formulas, and other matters.&#13;
&#13;
Verification institutions&#13;
Unlike the EU ETS, all of the pilot ETS require third party verification of emissions reported by the&#13;
emitters. Normally, the cost for verification should be borne by the emitters, but to facilitate the ETS,&#13;
local DRC funds the historic emission verifications. The competent authority is in charge of the&#13;
accreditation of verifiers. The competent authority accredits various numbers of verifiers to carry out&#13;
verification according to the demand. Large number of controlled entities in Beijing, Shanghai and&#13;
Shenzhen pilots requires more verifiers to successfully complete the task in a short period. Whereas&#13;
control enterprises in Tianjin and Guangdong needs less verifiers. Organizations for verification of GHG&#13;
emissions in the national level havenâ&#128;&#153;t been designated yet.&#13;
The process of accrediting verifiers and matching verifiers with companies are quite different in pilots.&#13;
Beijing and Guangdong select verifiers openly and put them on record. Verifiers are appointed to the&#13;
companies by the competent authority in the first two years. From the third year on, companies can&#13;
freely choose verifiers as long as it is in the authorityâ&#128;&#153;s record list. In Shenzhen and Shanghai, verifiers&#13;
are accredited the same way in Beijing and Guangdong, but companies are free to choose verifiers from&#13;
year one in Shenzhen and the service of verification is appointed to the verifiers through governmental&#13;
procurement, whereas Tianjin incorporates the accreditation of verifiers into the procurement process&#13;
where biding participants must meet the requirements set out in the tendering information.&#13;
&#13;
Verification requirements and procedures&#13;
The verification guidelines consist of similar stages and processes. Although the guidelines describe the&#13;
process in different length, they can be grouped in three stages: preparation stage, implementation&#13;
stage and reporting stage. In the first stage, verifiers sign a contract with enterprise, set up a verification&#13;
team and make a verification plan. During the implementation stage, verifier conducts document&#13;
review, field visit. In the final stage, report will be finalized, go through internal technical review and&#13;
finally submitted to the competent authority.&#13;
&#13;
Verification report&#13;
Four pilots have verification report contents in their guidelines, but in a different way. Beijingâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
verification guideline requires verifiers to report conformity with the local MR guidelines, assumptions,&#13;
equipment calibration and other information. Shenzhen pilot focuses on reporting of emission&#13;
inventory, verification method and procedures and the status of the non-compliance. Verification report&#13;
in Guangdong consists of a long list of headlines, among which emission number and emission source,&#13;
evidence list and founding are the most important elements. The verification report in the Hubei pilot&#13;
focuses on the implementation of the monitoring plan, demonstrating the status of the verification, the&#13;
implementation status of the monitoring plan, emission calculation and results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            13&#13;
&amp;#12;PMR Technical Note 8 (July 2014)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Penalty for non-compliance&#13;
There are largely three types of fines for non-compliance in the MRV mechanism. The first type is&#13;
fraudulence, concealment and refusal to report; the second type is obstruction of verification; the third&#13;
type is that the verifiers provide fraudulent information or reveal confidential information. The three&#13;
types of actions bear with different level of penalty in different pilots in terms of fine and penalty type.&#13;
Shanghai, Hubei, Guangdong and Shenzhen set out specific penalties for all three type of action, while&#13;
Tianjin lays down rules for two types and Beijing only stipulate fine for emitters who fails to fulfill&#13;
reporting obligation.&#13;
&#13;
Key Issues Facing All Pilots&#13;
Stakeholder Engagement&#13;
The MRV mechanism is the basis for climate policy making and the operation of ETS. The process&#13;
involves large groups of stakeholders, ranging from governmental officials, research institutions,&#13;
compliance entities, to verifiers. In different stages of the MRV development, different stakeholders get&#13;
involved.&#13;
&#13;
MRV design (Formulation/call for submission). In the formulation of MRV, experts from universities,&#13;
research institutes and consulting firms take part in the design of the MRV guidelines, led by the DRC for&#13;
each city/province. After the draft version is finished, different stakeholders including experts in the&#13;
enterprises and associations will be invited to give feedback. After that, the guidelines will be put on the&#13;
official web and a call for public opinion is made. The guidelines will be finalized after taking into&#13;
account the feedback from the public and experts.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity building. To facilitate the accounting and reporting of GHG emissions and the verification&#13;
process, the competent authority needs to organize trainings for personnel from the enterprises and&#13;
verifiers. The lecturer could be from the local think tanks, for example organizations that drafted the&#13;
accounting, reporting and verification guidelines, or it could be experts from abroad who have rich&#13;
experiences on implementation of MRV mechanism. The competent authority may also provide&#13;
guidance on compliance issues.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation. The main stakeholders in the implementation phase are the compliance enterprises,&#13;
verifiers and the competent authority. The enterprises carry out monitoring plan, collect data and&#13;
submit reports. The verifiers will first check the emission report. After the document review and site&#13;
visit, they can determine the final emissions, write the verification report and submit to the competent&#13;
authority. The competent authority provides guidance along the process and ensures compliance.&#13;
&#13;
Technical challenges&#13;
Boundary Determination. In determining accounting boundaries, enterprises rely on the provisions of&#13;
the guidelines. However, there are practical issues may involve further interpretation. For example,&#13;
within the boundary of an enterprise, there may be residential area for the staff. It could be difficult to&#13;
discern whether to include the emission from the community without specific provisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          14&#13;
&amp;#12;PMR Technical Note 8 (July 2014)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Outsourcing is a common measure to lower the operating cost, for example staff canteen, heating of the&#13;
building and so on. They are often located within the accounting boundary and owned by the reporting&#13;
entity. However, reporting of the emissions may not be the responsibility of the owner but of the one&#13;
who operates the facility, according to the accounting guideline of the Beijing pilot.&#13;
For the some service sectors such as real estate and shopping malls, there are often overlaps in emission&#13;
accounting, since building or part of the building is often leased to other companies. If the lessee is also&#13;
a controlled entity, the emissions caused by it must be excluded from the owner of the building.&#13;
Methodology Development. Calculation of the emissions is the key part of the MR guidelines and also a&#13;
major challenge in MR design. Most calculation-based methodologies utilize standard method, which&#13;
sum all emissions to provide the total. Emissions are calculated by multiplying activity data by an&#13;
emission factor. However, the structure of some industries is complex. For example, the chemical sector&#13;
may produce various types of products. Even in a sector with a simple product structure, its production&#13;
process could be complex enough to make it difficult to calculate emission via standard method. So in&#13;
this situation, the mass-balance method is often used.&#13;
Measurement-based methodologies are also available for emissions accounting, which often come with&#13;
a higher cost and sometimes with an equivalent level of uncertainty. For example, in the power sector,&#13;
most coal-fired power plants are already equipped with CEMS to monitor SO2 emissions and they only&#13;
need to insert a carbon probe into the chimney to monitor CO2 emissions. However, due to turbulence&#13;
in the chimney, the method of installation, and placement of the probe can have a great impact on CO2&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
Acquisition of parameters for calculation-based methodology. In some cases it is a challenge for&#13;
compliance entities to acquire the relevant parameters to calculate their emissions. For small&#13;
companies, the only time they weigh the coal is when they pay for it. The consumption of coal will be&#13;
recorded by rough estimation. For example, estimate the weight of a cart of coal and record how many&#13;
cart are burnt. Or they can rely on the invoice from the supplier. Either way, inaccuracy of the activity&#13;
data will be imposed.&#13;
Emission factors are calculated from NCV, carbon content per energy and oxidation factor. These&#13;
parameters all need measurements. Small companies often lack of capability to measure these values by&#13;
their own.&#13;
Meters for measurement of electricity, natural gas needs regular calibration to stay accurate, but in the&#13;
reality, the calibration is sometimes forgotten or ignored. This may also constitute an obstacle for&#13;
getting an accurate emission number.&#13;
Acquisition of evidence for cross check. As to verification, there are also challenges posed to the&#13;
verifiers. Cross check of data source is a basic step in verification and invoices and receipts are the&#13;
commonly used evidences. However, the reporting period is usually different from the financial cycle,&#13;
which makes it harder to cross check with invoices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          15&#13;

Annex I: Capacity building workshops&#13;
An ETS is a relatively new concept to the authorities and industries in China, especially in terms of&#13;
technical design and implementation. To facilitate the operation of ETS, the DRC in the pilots have&#13;
organized training sessions for the industries and verifiers to get acquainted with relevant concepts,&#13;
obligations, MRV guidelines and relevant procedures. Table 1 provides a list of the training workshops.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This report provides a survey of the key
            features associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring,
            reporting, and verification (MRV) systems that support the
            pilot emissions trading schemes (ETS) in China. The seven
            pilots are: Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai,
            Shenzhen, and Tianjin. This report has the following
            structure. (1) It begins with an overview of each ETS, to
            provide context for the MRV systems of the pilots. (2) The
            second part includes a summary table of the attributes of
            the MRV systems for all the pilots. (3) The report concludes
            with observations about the similarities and differences of
            the MRV systems for the pilots as well as the published
            rules and procedures for the national MRV system. The
            technical challenges for developing the MRV are also
            identified. Practical aspects of the determination of
            boundaries, development of methodology, acquisition of
            activity data, emission factors and evidence for cross check
            are discussed. Engagement of stakeholders, capacity building
            and supporting institutions are also explored, as well as
            lessons learned.
