The Environment and Natural Resources Division of The World Bank Institute conducted a core course on&#13;
Policy and Institutional Reform for Sustainable Development in Washington, D.C., from December 7-11,&#13;
1998. The five-day course in Washington was one of the key activities of the parent program, "Policy and&#13;
Institutional Reform for Sustainable Rural Development"" The Washington course will be followed by a series&#13;
of distance education courses to be piloted in Africa in 1999. The objective of the Washington course was to&#13;
help participants initiate and manage the process and the substance of policy and institutional reforms in the&#13;
rural sector. By providing the latest thinking and good practices in rural development, the course aimed at&#13;
helping participants in the following areas: 1) identifying key institutional issues; 2) diagnosing institutional&#13;
problems; 3) formulating viable options; and 4) implementing effective institutional solutions to the problems.&#13;
The course comprised four major components - the global and national context, the process and substance&#13;
of policy and institutional reform, cross-cutting issues, and subsector issues. The subsector issues consisted&#13;
of 11 specific topics that were presented in 4 parallel sessions organized in 2 afternoon periods. The course&#13;
was attended by a total of 46 participants from 20 countries, representing senior policymakers and managers&#13;
in developing countries and transition economies, as well as Bank staff, who are responsible for policy and&#13;
institutional reforms in rural development. Six participants (13%) were women.&#13;
&#13;
The WBI Evaluation Unit conducted a Level 1 (participants' reaction) evaluation using two types of&#13;
participants' feedback questionnaires. First, participants were asked to assess communication and&#13;
presentation skills of different instructors who presented the 11 subsector issues. A 5-point Likert type scale&#13;
that ranged from 1=minimum to 5=maximum was used. The questionnaire was completed at the end of each&#13;
presentation by all participants in each session. Secondly, the end-of-course questionnaire was administered&#13;
at the completion of the entire course. This questionnaire consisted of three sections. The first section asked&#13;
the extent to which the respondents were satisfied with overall course design and delivery. The second&#13;
section asked the level of respondents' knowledge about course topics before and after the course, based on&#13;
self-assessment. A 5-point scale was used for each question in both sections. The third section requested&#13;
respondents' open-ended comments about the course. The end-of-course questionnaire was completed by&#13;
42 respondents, 91.3% of the total participants, including all 6 women (14.3%). Following is a summary of the&#13;
evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Respondents' Background&#13;
&#13;
     ·   Respondents consisted of 23 attendees from national or local governments (54.8%); 9 from&#13;
         university or research institutions (21.4%); 6 from the World Bank (14.3%); and 4 from other&#13;
         organizations (9.5%). Thirty-two respondents were from the Africa region (76.2%); 3 (7.1%) from&#13;
         Europe and Central Asia; 3 (7.1%) from the Middle East and North Africa; and 4 (9.5%) from other&#13;
         regions.&#13;
&#13;
     ·   A large majority of respondents had advanced academic degrees. Thirty-eight out of the 42&#13;
         respondents (90.5%) reported to have either masters degrees or equivalent (N=24), or doctorate&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      degrees (N=14). Four respondents (9.5%) had first university degrees.&#13;
&#13;
  ·   Respondents had substantial professional experience in the field of rural development. Twenty-nine&#13;
      respondents (69.0%) had more than 10 years of work experience, including 21 respondents (50%)&#13;
      with 10-20 years, and 8 (19.0%) with 21 years or more experience. Among the remaining 8&#13;
      respondents (19%) who reported to have had less than 10 years of experience, 7 respondents had at&#13;
      least 5 years of work experience in the field.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Course Design and Delivery&#13;
&#13;
  ·   The overall usefulness of the course received a mean score of 4.10 on a 5-point scale. Respondents&#13;
      showed a particularly high degree of satisfaction with the course's relevancy to their current work&#13;
      (mean=4.56). This was the highest rating of all performance indicators, with 95% of respondents&#13;
      rating either 4 or 5 on this item. The extent to which the course focused on high priority issues was&#13;
      another item that received one of the highest ratings (mean=4.31).&#13;
&#13;
  ·   The course used five different methods of instruction to deliver its messages. When asked about the&#13;
      usefulness of each method at the end of the course, respondents reported the videos (mean=4.32)&#13;
      and background reading and supporting materials (mean=4.30) as particularly useful, in addition to&#13;
      the lecture presentations (mean=4.07). Case studies (mean=3.64) and exercises (mean=3.66)&#13;
      received relatively lower ratings.&#13;
&#13;
  ·   Each of the 11 subsector issues was presented by a different instructor(s). Results showed&#13;
      respondents' varying views about the effectiveness of the use of visual presentation materials and&#13;
      case studies across presentations. The extent to which the visual materials reinforced the messages&#13;
      was rated as low as 2.60 in one presentation ("Land administration and reform") and as high as 4.29&#13;
      in another presentation ("Agricultural extension"). The extent to which the case studies helped&#13;
      understand the concepts ranged from 3.0 ("Irrigation") to 4.07 ("Agricultural extension").&#13;
&#13;
  ·   The quality of instructors in 11 subsector sessions was also assessed by three additional indicators.&#13;
      Among the 11 instructors, the clearness of communication ranged from 3.57 to 4.59, the depth of&#13;
      treatment of the topic from 3.08 to 4.25, and the adequacy in answering questions from 3.33 to 4.43.&#13;
      Five instructors received particularly positive feedback from respondents, a rating exceeding 4.0 on 2&#13;
      or all 3 indicators. On the other hand, there were 3 instructors whose ratings fell below 4.0 on all 3&#13;
      items.&#13;
&#13;
  ·   One aspect of the course design addressed by many respondents was the limited amount of&#13;
      interchange in class during the course. Twenty-four respondents (57.1%) reported the time allocated&#13;
      for discussion was either "insufficient" or "somewhat insufficient"" Eighteen respondents (42.9%)&#13;
      gave a similar unfavorable response on the level of interaction between participants and instructors.&#13;
      In their written comments, many of the respondents mentioned how the course could be improved by&#13;
      allowing more time for sharing different views and experiences of course participants (N=17). Their&#13;
      main suggestions were to facilitate participants' active participation to the course by ensuring time for&#13;
      discussions between instructors and participants, as well as organizing group exercises. For the&#13;
      upcoming distance learning courses, it would be important for the course organizer to ensure an&#13;
      appropriate level of participants' interaction with course instructors, particularly because participants&#13;
      will not be able to see their instructors face-to-face except by videoconference. In designing the&#13;
      distance learning courses, the course organizer is advised to focus on how to create an environment&#13;
      that would be conducive to learning and would encourage participant questions and debate, in order&#13;
      to maintain participant interest and keep them engaged in the course activities throughout the course&#13;
      duration.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Self-Reported Knowledge&#13;
&#13;
   ·   Respondents' largest pre/post gain in reported knowledge level was observed on "how to initiate and&#13;
       manage a process of policy and institutional reform in the rural sector" This item was the stated&#13;
       objective of the course. The mean scores improved from 2.80 before the course to 4.15 after the&#13;
       course, a percentage increase by 48.2%. A majority of respondents (90%) rated either 4 or 5 on a 5-&#13;
       point scale on this indicator, compared to 22.0% at the beginning of the course. This indicated that&#13;
       the course was perceived as successful in achieving its stated objective.&#13;
&#13;
   ·   On the issue covering the general framework of the course, "what institutions are and why they are&#13;
       important for sustainable rural development," respondents reported another high level of gain&#13;
       (45.3%). The pre-course rating of 2.85 improved to 4.15 after the course on this indicator. On the&#13;
       three specific goals of the course, the ratings also had positive increases (38-41%) but the post-&#13;
       course levels fell slightly below 4.0. The mean score on "how to identify key institutional issues in a&#13;
       particular rural sector" rose from 2.85 to 3.95, on "how to diagnose institutional problems" from 2.79&#13;
       to 3.95, and on "how to formulate viable institutional options" from 2.73 to 3.85.&#13;

            division of The World Bank Institute conducted a core course
            on policy and institutional reform for sustainable
            development in Washington, D.C., from December 7-11, 1998.
