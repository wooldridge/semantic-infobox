        <abstracts>
            Mexico's private toll road program
            more than doubled the national toll road network from 1989
            to 1994. The investment of approximately US$13 billion in
            the program was sourced from local commercial bank debt,
            concessionaire equity, and federal and state government
            grants and equity contribution. However, gross
            miscalculation of investment costs and operating income led
            to an unsustainable set of operating conditions for these
            limited recourse financings. The financial equilibrium of
            the sector was further undermined by the Mexican currency
            crisis of December 1994. All these brought the project
            development to a standstill and resulted in widespread
            financial and economic repercussions. Some industry
            observers have characterized the toll road program as a
            poorly designed effort to develop the infrastructure the
            country needed to compete effectively in an era of free
            trade. From a private investment perspective the impact was
            to shut off capital flows to the sector and to add to the
            Mexican banking system s non-performing loan portfolio. This
            Note presents a diagnostic of key policy, regulatory, and
            institutional gaps that undermined the financial equilibrium
            of the sector. A checklist of recurrent problems illustrates
            how the failure to address these issues manifested itself in
            the course of implementation.
