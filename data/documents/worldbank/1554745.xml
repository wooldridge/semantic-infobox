Kerala's fertility declined by more than 35 percent during the decade&#13;
1968-78. This was rather unexpected as the population of Kerala is still&#13;
very poor, with a per capita income less than $200. Why did fertility&#13;
decline in Kerala in such an unfavorable circumstances? A resolution of this&#13;
anomaly is the object of this paper.&#13;
The study concludes that the fertility decline in Kerala was caused&#13;
by an optimum sequence of the commonly recognized determinants of fertility&#13;
trends. The decline began with improvements in health and education, but it&#13;
gathered momentum as a result of subsequent policy interventions that&#13;
included an official family planning program, land reforms, wage reforms, and&#13;
other redistributive policies.&#13;

En el estado de Kerala, la fecundidad declin6 en mAs del 35%&#13;
durante el decenio de 1968-78. Esta disminuci6n fue mAs bien inesperada&#13;
ya que la poblaci6n de este estado sigue siendo muy pobre, con un ingreso&#13;
per cApita inferior a US$200. £Por que descendi6 la fecundidad en&#13;
circunstancias tan desfavorables? El objetivo de este informe es procurar&#13;
aclarar esta anomalia.&#13;
Se llega a la conclusi6n de que la declinaci6n de la fecundidad&#13;
en Kerala fue producida por una secuencia 6ptima de los determinantes&#13;
comuinmente reconocidos de las tendencias de fecundidad. Empez6 a&#13;
descender al mejorar la salud y la educaci6n, pero cobr6 impulso como&#13;
consecuencia de posteriores medidas de politica, entre ellas, un programa&#13;
oficial de planificaci6n familiar, la reforma de la tenencia de la tierra,&#13;
reformas salariales y otras politicas relativas a la redistribuci6n.&#13;

FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff Working&#13;
Papers on population change and development. Most of the papers in the&#13;
series were prepared as background papers for World Development Report&#13;
1984. This paper was prepared in connection with a World Bank-supported&#13;
research project. Like the commissioned background papers, it provides&#13;
more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues dealt with in&#13;
Part II of the 1984 Report. The papers in this series cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of fertility and mortality, the links&#13;
between population growth and internal and international migration, and&#13;
the management, financing, and effectiveness of family planning programs.&#13;
They include several country and regional studies of fertility change and&#13;
population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published and&#13;
unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy analysis and&#13;
research, and on reports of other organizations working on population and&#13;
development programs and issues. The papers are the work of individuals,&#13;
and the views and interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily&#13;
coincide with the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement World Development&#13;
Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population and development&#13;
issues among students and practitioners of development.&#13;

Preface&#13;
This study of the determinants of fertility decline in Kerala is part&#13;
of a larger research project sponsored by the World Bank entitled "Case&#13;
Studies of the Determinants of Fertility Decline in Sri Lanka and South&#13;
India" (RPO 671-70). Three household surveys were conducted to gather data&#13;
for the analysis: in Kerala, Karnataka, and Sri Lanka. The Karnataka study&#13;
was carried out by the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bangalore,&#13;
and the Sri Lanka Study by the Department of Census and Statistics, Colombo.&#13;
All three studies have the same objective: an understanding of the&#13;
determinants of fertility decline in a low-income population. While the&#13;
socioeconomic and family planning factors differ slightly from one population&#13;
to the next, the studies are complementary in the sense that a comparison of&#13;
their findings enriches the understanding of the fertility decline in each&#13;
separate population. Other reports and articles based on this research&#13;
project are listed following the biblography.&#13;
The Kerala study was organized as a collaborative research effort&#13;
between the World Bank and the Kerala State Bureau of Economics and&#13;
Statistics (the Bureau). The objectives of the project were defined by the&#13;
Bank; the survey instruments were prepared jointly by the Bank and the&#13;
Bureau; and the field work was organized and carried out by the Bureau with&#13;
the help of its staff and a team of field investigators recruited especially&#13;
for the purpose. The cost of the study was met mostly by funds provided by&#13;
the Bank and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, but the&#13;
Bureau shared the expenses by providing vehicles, offices, and other logistic&#13;
services.&#13;
On behalf of the Bank and as the principal researcher of the project,&#13;
I wish to acknowledge my thanks to the governments and organizations which&#13;
helped carry out this project -- to the UNFPA for providing partial financial&#13;
support; to the Governments of India and Sri Lanka for collaborating with the&#13;
Bank on the project; and to the Bureau of Economics and Statistics in&#13;
Trivandrum.&#13;
In preparing this report, I have received the advice and support of a&#13;
number of persons. Dr. P.A. Nair, Director, Bureau of Economics and&#13;
Statistics, Trivandrum, provided very valuable assistance in carrying out the&#13;
survey and getting the data processed. Dr. R.S. Kurup, Additional Director&#13;
of the Bureau, was a major source of help at all stages of the study. He&#13;
also contributed to the report by preparing a background paper on the&#13;
determinants of age at marriage (Chapter 8). Mr. P.S. Gopinathan Nair, as&#13;
officer-in-charge of the project, was largely responsible for the high&#13;
quality of the survey data.   He also helped in the report writing by&#13;
preparing background papers (for Chapters 2 and 3). Three other people in&#13;
the Bureau of Economics and Statistics deserve special mention: Messrs.&#13;
Somasekaran Nair, P. Gopinathan Nair, and E.G. John.&#13;

Professor Krishnan Namboodiri, Dr. T.N. Krishnan, and Mr. V.C.&#13;
Chidambaram were associated with the project from its beginning. Professor&#13;
Namboodiri helped in preparing the project proposal; Dr. Krishnan played a&#13;
significant role in reviewing the conceptual framework of the determinants of&#13;
fertility decline in Kerala; and Mr. Chidambaram provided expert advice from&#13;
the World Fertility Survey experience.&#13;
The report benefited considerably from co,mments received from several&#13;
staff members within the World Bank: Jeremy Warford, Timothy King, Susan&#13;
Cochrane, Nancy Birdsall, Dr. Kandiah Kanagaratnam, Roberto Cuca, Huw Jones,&#13;
Nydia Maraviglia, and Rashid Faruquee.&#13;
The data required for the report were processed partly at the Bureau&#13;
(Trivandrum), and partly at the Bank. This work as well as the statistical&#13;
analysis were ably carried out by Mr. Kalyanaraman at Trivandrum, and by&#13;
Sulekha Patel, My Vu, and Ann Elwan at the Bank, with occasional assistance&#13;
from Kalpana Mehra. I am very appreciative of their substantial&#13;
contributions from the beginning of the project.&#13;
The arduous task of putting together the draft chapters written over&#13;
a period of three years fell on Bonnie Newlon. I am very thankful for all&#13;
her assistance in making this a consistent report. Jeanne Rosen edited the&#13;
final manuscript for publication, retaining our findings in a form both&#13;
pleasant and enlightening. While this project has benefited from the work of&#13;
many, I am -- needless to add -- responsible for the errors.&#13;

Summary and Conclusions&#13;
The principal objective of this study was an analysis of the&#13;
determinants of the fertility decline which took place in Kerala in recent&#13;
years under seemingly unfavorable circumstances. The study used data&#13;
collected from 3,000 households selected at random from three districts of&#13;
the state -- Alleppey, Ernakulum, and Phalghat. The analysis aimed at&#13;
estimating fertility trends by socioeconomic groups and developing a socio-&#13;
economic framework to explain these trends.&#13;
The results of the survey indicated that the fertility decline in&#13;
Kerala was as sharp as indicated by official figures.    The decline was not&#13;
confined to any particular socioeconomic group but was evident among all&#13;
socioeconomic as well as cultural groups. It was greatest among those women&#13;
whose years of schooling and family income were in the intermediate range&#13;
rather than at either extreme.&#13;
About 30 percent of the overall fertility decline between 1965 and&#13;
1980 can be attributed to an increase in age at marriage. The impact of this&#13;
factor has been on the increase in recent years. The socioeconomic determi-&#13;
nants of age at marriage were similar to those for fertility. The more years&#13;
of schooling a woman had, or the better off she was economically, the more&#13;
likely she was to marry at an older age. Caste and religion also made a&#13;
difference. Employment of the prospective husband is emerging as a pre-&#13;
requisite to marriage; most women would rather wait than marry someone who is&#13;
unemployed. Dowry problems also cause delays, as the price goes up in&#13;
response to the increased cost of educating a boy and his increased&#13;
difficulties in securing job.&#13;
About 70 percent of the fertility decline during this period&#13;
represented a decline in marital fertility. Kerala has one of the most suc-&#13;
cessful family planning programs in India. While there are some methodo-&#13;
logical difficulties in measuring the impact of a family planning program on&#13;
marital fertility, this study provides considerable evidence that recent&#13;
official family planning efforts have made a major dent in Kerala's fertility&#13;
rate. Almost all women know about some form of birth control. About 52&#13;
percent of the currently married women surveyed were themselves sterilized,&#13;
had a sterilized husband, or were using a conventional family planning&#13;
method. About 31 percent relied on sterilization; indeed, sterilization&#13;
alone may well account for much of the ferility decline not due to increase&#13;
in age at marriage. Socioeconomic variables have some significant correla-&#13;
tion to family planning, but they nevertheless explain only a small percent-&#13;
age of the total variation in knowledge and use. The nature and services of&#13;
the family planning program itself seem to be of greater importance in&#13;
determining whether a particular couple does or does not adopt some form of&#13;
family planning.&#13;
Irrespective of the means by which fertility was controlled, the&#13;
underlying factors were a series of socioeconomic changes. But these changes&#13;
alone would not have produced the type of fertility decline that occurred in&#13;
Kerala. The official family planning program played a crucial role in&#13;
helping to convert the lower desired family size into a reduced number of&#13;

Educational'developments and improvements in health successfully&#13;
altered the cost-benefit ratio of children. Falling mortality rates&#13;
increased the number of children surviving to school age. Rapid population&#13;
growth, resulting mostly from the mortality decline, lowered further an&#13;
already very low land-man ratio in the State, forcing more and more&#13;
youngsters to seek a living away from the farms. The introduction of&#13;
education as a criterion for admittance to non-agricultural occupations&#13;
enhanced the economic value of education and raised parents' aspirations&#13;
about their children's education. The increase ,in the number of surviving&#13;
children, together with the increase in the perceived necessary level of&#13;
education, raised the cost of bringing up children. As most Kerala families&#13;
did not have the necessary income to meet this increased cost, they realized&#13;
that the solution to their dilemma was to opt for 'a smaller family.&#13;
The increase in the cost of bringing up children has been accompanied&#13;
by a decrease in the cost of fertility control. Before 1960 family planning&#13;
services were not widely available in Kerala. When the official family&#13;
planning services were introduced, they were not only free, but actually&#13;
included some economic incentives for the acceptors. The official family&#13;
planning program provided a needed service and acted as an independent causal&#13;
factor in the fertility decline.&#13;
Nevertheless, for a significant proportion of married couples, new&#13;
attitudes toward family size were not strong enough to spur them to visit a&#13;
family planning clinic and avail themselves of its services. A rough&#13;
estimate shows that about 13 percent of married women in Kerala who do not&#13;
want any more children are not taking any steps to protect themselves from&#13;
unwanted pregnancy. It is among women with an unmet need for family planning&#13;
that the official program can and does play a major role. Without such a&#13;
program, the number of women in Kerala with more children than they wanted&#13;
would have been several times greater, and the fertility decline would have&#13;
been 36 percent less.&#13;
Has Kerala's experience any relevance to other populations? To the&#13;
extent that historical developments were as critical a factor as recent&#13;
policy interventions in bringing down the birth rate, the experience is not&#13;
entirely replicable elsewhere. At the same time, there are certain lessons&#13;
to be learned from an analysis of the determinants of Kerala's fertility&#13;
decline that are broadly applicable.&#13;
First, a government-sponsored family planning program can make a&#13;
substantial dent in fertility rates (decreasing them by about 40 percent in&#13;
Kerala during 1968-78), not only among the higher socioeconomic strata, but&#13;
even more so among the lower strata.   Within limits, the normal positive&#13;
association between socioeconomic status and family planning acceptance can&#13;
be broken by a good family planning delivery system aided by economic&#13;
incentives. Without a very strong program, however, it may be difficult to&#13;
produce an acceptance rate among the poor as high as or close to that of the&#13;
rich.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xxvii -&#13;
Second, the principal socioeconomic determinants of fertility decline&#13;
in Kerala, as in many other populations, have been mortality decline and&#13;
educational improvement. It is unlikely that the major demand-creating&#13;
factors in other populations would be much different. Thus, health and&#13;
education are the principal variables to be manipulated to create additional&#13;
demand for fertility control.&#13;
Third, the official family planning program has been more effective&#13;
in Kerala than in the other States of India. One major reason is the higher&#13;
spin-off effect between the program and socioeconomic developments relevant&#13;
to fertility decline (health and education in particular).    One lesson from&#13;
this is that the sequence in which policies affecting the determinants of&#13;
fertility are implemented is as important as the policies themselves.    In&#13;
Kerala, the steps came in the right order -- a reduction in infant and child&#13;
mortality, accompanied or followed by an increase in female education,&#13;
followed by redistributive policies and finally by the official family&#13;
planning program.   The impact of Kerala's family planning program would have&#13;
been much smaller and more temporary had the program been introduced prior to&#13;
a substantial reduction in the infant mortality rate and a substantial&#13;
improvement in female education. In populations where the infant mortality&#13;
rate is still high and where female literacy is still low, the impact of a&#13;
similar family planning program would be much more limited. In such&#13;
populations, improvements in health and education should be accelerated, not&#13;
only for their own sake, but also as an essential part of a family planning&#13;
effort.&#13;
Fourth, in spite of a very successful family planning program, about&#13;
13 percent of the married women of Kerala who do not want any more children&#13;
are not sterilized themselves, nor have a sterilized husband, nor are using a&#13;
contraceptive. One possible reason for such a large unmet demand is dislike&#13;
of the type of family planning methods, especially the terminal methods,&#13;
offered by the program. These women could be brought into the program if&#13;
acceptable, reversible methods were offered.&#13;
Fifth, land reforms and other redistributive policies help to spread&#13;
small family norms. While their short-term effect on fertility may not be&#13;
great, such reforms have a significant role to play in a long-term strategy&#13;
to reduce fertility.&#13;
Sixth, an increase in age at marriage played a major role in Kerala's&#13;
fertility decline. The potential for fertility decline in the other States&#13;
of India through increased age at marriage is very great. This is a means of&#13;
fertility reduction which is largely untapped in most of India.&#13;

Chapter 1. Introduction&#13;
It is widely believed that during the past 15 to 20 years the birth&#13;
rate in Kerala in southwest India has fallen very sharply, despite seemingly&#13;
unfavorable conditions. This situation is contrary to what would be expected&#13;
from circumstances elsewhere in the world. Such a rapid fertility decline is&#13;
an anomaly, given the level of poverty and the relative lack of economic&#13;
progress in the region. The present study, based on a field investigation in&#13;
three districts of Kerala State, seeks to account for this anomaly by&#13;
analyzing the determinants of the fertility decline that has occurred in&#13;
recent years, and to understand the implications of the Kerala experience for&#13;
future policymaking.&#13;
The Anomaly&#13;
Official estimates of the fertility level and trends in Kerala are&#13;
based on evidence that is varied and mutually supportive. The Sample&#13;
Registration System (SRS) indicates that between 1966 and 1978 the birth rate&#13;
in rural Kerala declined from 37 to 26 per thousand population (Government of&#13;
India, Vital Statistics Division, 1966-78). The 1981 census of India records&#13;
that the State's population increase fell from 26 percent in 1961-71 to 19&#13;
percent in 1971-81, a drop of 0.6 in the annual percentage growth rate&#13;
(Government of India, Registrar General and Census Commissioner, 1981,&#13;
Series-1, Paper 1, p. 53). The number of students in Standard I increased by&#13;
2.7 percent a year between 1960/61 and 1970/71, but decreased by 2.2 percent&#13;
a year between 1970/71 and 1979/80 (Government of Kerala, Directorate of&#13;
Economics and Statistics, 1980, p. 252). Between 1964 and 1976, more than a&#13;
million married individuals were sterilized and about 1.4 million births were&#13;
averted by the official family planning program (Government of Kerala 1978,&#13;
Table 13).&#13;
Fertility declines of such magnitude as those reported for Kerala&#13;
are not unprecedented in other societies. In fact, more rapid fertility&#13;
declines have been observed in recent years in other Asian populations;&#13;
Singapore, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, China are well-known&#13;
examples. Falling fertility rates in these cases have been associated with&#13;
high average per capita income, rapid economic growth, a large proportion of&#13;
the labor force in nonagricultural occupations, high female literacy and&#13;
employment, high nutritional levels, low mortality, high national&#13;
expenditures for family planning programs, and other indications of social&#13;
and economic change.&#13;
The conditions in Kerala, however, do not conform to this&#13;
socioeconomic development pattern, and would not seem to favor a rapid&#13;
fertility decline. As one of the poorer States of India, with a per capita&#13;
income less than that of India as a whole, Kerala compares very unfavorably&#13;
with the Asian economies mentioned above. Per capita income is less than&#13;
US$200, compared with over $5,240 in Singapore, $5,100 in Hong Kong, and&#13;
$1,700 in Korea. Moreover, in 1971 about 55 percent of the labor force in&#13;
Kerala was employed in the agricultural sector compared with 2 percent in&#13;
Singapore, 3 percent in Hong Kong, and 41 percent in Korea.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
Regarding nutrition, the rank of Kerala among the Indian States is&#13;
uncertain. According to the Indian National Sample Survey (NSS), the per&#13;
capita calorie consumption in Kerala was only 1,571 in 1973-74, or 70 percent&#13;
of the average daily requirement. This is two-thirds of the daily per capita&#13;
consumption in India, 50 percent that of Singapore, 53 percent that of Hong&#13;
Kong, and 55 percent that of Taiwan, China, and of Korea (see Panikar 1980;&#13;
World Bank 1980, Table 22).&#13;
Female literacy and total average life expectancy in Kerala compare&#13;
very favorably with other parts of India. Female literacy in 1981 was 66&#13;
percent in Kerala as opposed to 25 percent in India; life expectancy in 1978&#13;
was 65 years in Kerala but only 54 years in India. The East Asian "success"&#13;
economies and Kerala are fairly similar in average female literacy and total&#13;
life expectancy.1/&#13;
Kerala spends comparatively less per capita on family planning than&#13;
the "success" economies, however; in 1978 the expenditure was less than 9 US&#13;
cents (Government of Kerala 1978, Appendix E, Table 1). Singapore, by&#13;
comparison, spent 30 cents; Hong Kong, 10 cents; Taiwan, China, 11 cents;&#13;
Korea, 16 cents; and Malaysia, 20 cents (Nortman and Hofstatter 1978, Table&#13;
9).&#13;
Thus, many conditions in Kerala are different from those in other&#13;
populations that have experienced rapid declines in fertility. If high per&#13;
capita income and rapid economic growth are necessary conditions for curbing&#13;
fertility, then Kerala's fertility would not have declined so sharply. Nor&#13;
would it have done so if urbanization and rapid industrialization are&#13;
essential prerequisites, or if a high level of nutritional intake is&#13;
crucial. Kerala does not conform to the stereotype of the East Asian&#13;
"success" economies, yet fertility has indeed fallen.    This is the anomaly of&#13;
the fertility decline in Kerala, the investigation of which is the objective&#13;
of this study.&#13;
What are the causes of Kerala's fertility decline?    The question is&#13;
put very lucidly by John Ratcliffe in a 1978 article in the International&#13;
Journal of Health Services:&#13;
How did such a large population with levels of income and nutrition&#13;
among the lowest in the world achieve levels of fertility and&#13;
mortality substantially lower than surrounding populations with&#13;
similar cultural backgrounds but higher incomes and caloric&#13;
intakes? The answer to this question holds profound implications&#13;
for all nations concerned with population, health, and social and&#13;
economic development. (p. 124)&#13;
1/ Life expectancy at birth in 1978 was 63 in Korea, 72 in Taiwan,&#13;
China and in Hong Kong, and 70 in Singapore (World Bank 1980, Table 21).&#13;
Female literacy among those six years old and over reached 84 percent in&#13;
Korea in 1970, 63 percent in Hong Kong in 1971, 81 percent in Taiwan, China&#13;
in 1975, and 67 percent in Singapore in 1976 (Nortman and Hofstatter 1978,&#13;
Table 3).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Conclusions from the Study&#13;
The demographic data available for Kerala are barely sufficient to&#13;
describe the recent fertility trend in the State as a whole; they are not at&#13;
all sufficient to answer the key question posed above. In order to make&#13;
possible an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the fertility decline&#13;
and its determinants, the research project included the collection of&#13;
relevant data through a sample survey. As the main objective was a&#13;
determination of the causes of the fertility decline (and not an estimation&#13;
of the fertility level for the State as a whole), it was thought unnecessary&#13;
to cover the entire State. Three districts were selected for field&#13;
investigation, one from each of the three administrative divisions which form&#13;
the present Kerala State: Palghat District, Ernakulam District, and Alleppey&#13;
District (see map). The choice was made not at random, but on the basis of&#13;
geographic location, fertility level, and certain field problems associated&#13;
with carrying out detailed interviews on family planning and related matters.&#13;
The household was the ultimate sampling unit. From each of the&#13;
three districts, a sample of about 1,000 households was selected. The&#13;
300-odd questions used in the interviews provided a detailed picture of the&#13;
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of each household and of the&#13;
adult members living in it. Information was collected on children born,&#13;
family planning knowledge and use, age at marriage, and attitudes toward&#13;
marriage. The socioeconomic variables surveyed included housing, education,&#13;
religion, caste, occupation, and income of both men and women.&#13;
The results of the survey confirmed that the official estimates of&#13;
fertility level and trend were quite accurate, and that the fertility decline&#13;
in Kerala State was indeed sharp in recent years not only among the rich and&#13;
well educated, but also among the poor and illiterate sectors of the&#13;
population. Furthermore, an analysis of the data reveals that an increase in&#13;
both age at marriage and family planning practice contributed to this&#13;
decline.&#13;
While it is true that women in all the major socioeconomic groups&#13;
in the survey districts have been giving birth to fewer children, the&#13;
fertility decline was greatest among those women whose years of schooling and&#13;
family income were in the intermediate range rather than at either extreme.&#13;
Socioeconomic variables did show certain significant correlations with&#13;
fertility during the period covered by this study. At the same time,&#13;
differences related to such factors have tended to narrow in recent years.&#13;
About 30 percent of the overall fertility decline between 1965 and&#13;
1980 can be attributed to an increase in the age at which women married and a&#13;
corresponding decrease in the proportion of women married. The impact of&#13;
this factor has been incresaing in recent years. The socioeconomic&#13;
determinants of age at marriage were similar to those for fertility. The&#13;
more years of schooling a woman had, or the better off she was economically,&#13;
the more likely she was to marry at an older age. Caste and religion also&#13;
made a difference. In addition, several other considerations, perhaps less&#13;
relevant in the past, contributed to delaying marriages. Employment of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
prospective husband is emerging as a prerequisite to marriage; most women&#13;
would rather wait than marry someone who is unemployed. Dowry problems can&#13;
also cause delays, as the price goes up in response to the increased costs of&#13;
educating a boy and his increased difficulties in securing a job.&#13;
The remainder of the fertility decline during this period&#13;
represented a decline in marital fertility. Kerala is considered to have one&#13;
of the most successful family planning programs in India. While there are&#13;
some methodological difficulties in measuring the impact of a family planning&#13;
program on marital fertility, this study provides considerable evidence that&#13;
recent official family planning efforts have made some dent in Kerala's&#13;
fertility rate. Almost all women know something about birth control&#13;
methods. About 52 percent of the currently married women surveyed were&#13;
themselves sterilized, had a sterilized husband, or were using a conventional&#13;
family planning method. Sterilization alone may well account for much of the&#13;
fertility decline not due to an increase in age at marriage; the impact of&#13;
conventional contraceptive use on fertility turns out to be minimal.&#13;
Socioeconomic variables have some significant correlation to family planning&#13;
practices, but they nevertheless explain only a small percentage of the total&#13;
variation in knowledge and use. The nature and services of the family&#13;
planning program itself seem to be of greater importance in determining&#13;
whether a particular couple does or does not adopt some form of family&#13;
planning.&#13;
Irrespective of the means by which fertility was controlled,&#13;
whether by delayed marriage or through family planning practice among the&#13;
married, the underlying factors accounting for the decline were a series of&#13;
socioeconomic changes which altered the cost-benefit ratio of children and&#13;
consequently the accepted norms about family size. But these changes alone&#13;
would not have produced the type of fertility decline that occurred in&#13;
Kerala. The official family planning program played a crucial role in&#13;
helping to convert the lower desired family size into a reduced number of&#13;
children.&#13;
The socioeconomic changes which successfully altered the&#13;
cost-benefit ratio of children were primarily improvements in health and&#13;
education over a long period of time. Falling mortality rates increased the&#13;
number of children surviving to school age. Rapid population growth,&#13;
resulting mostly from the mortality decline, lowered further an already very&#13;
low land-man ratio in the State, forcing more and more youngsters to seek a&#13;
living away from the farms. The introduction of education as a criterion for&#13;
admittance to nonagricultural occupations enhanced the economic value of&#13;
education and raised parents' aspirations about their children's education.&#13;
In the caste-ridden Kerala society, education offers the best chance for&#13;
upward social mobility. The increase in the number of surviving children,&#13;
together with the increase in the perceived necessary level of education,&#13;
raised the cost of bringing up children. As most Kerala families did not&#13;
have enough income to meet this increased cost, they realized that the&#13;
solution to their dilemma was to opt for a smaller family.&#13;
The increase in the cost of bringing up children has been&#13;
accompanied by a decrease in the cost of fertility control. Before 1960&#13;
family planning services were not widely available in Kerala.    When the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
official family planning services were introduced, they were not only free,&#13;
but actually included some economic incentives for the acceptors. The&#13;
official family planning program provided a needed service and acted as an&#13;
independent causal factor in the fertility decline.&#13;
Nevertheless, for a large proportion of married couples, new&#13;
attitudes toward family size were not strong enough to spur them to visit a&#13;
family planning clinic and avail themselves of its services. A rough&#13;
estimate shows that about 18 percent of all married women in Kerala who had&#13;
as many children as they wanted, or more than they wanted, did not take any&#13;
steps to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy. It is among such women&#13;
-- with their unmet demand for family planning -- that the official program&#13;
can and does play a major role. Without such a program, the number of women&#13;
in Kerala with more children than they desire would have been several times&#13;
greater, and the fertility decline would have been 36 percent less.&#13;
The Kerala experience has demonstrated the feasibility of bringing&#13;
about a substantial fertility decline even among the poor and the illiterate&#13;
through an efficient family planning program. This does not signify,&#13;
however, that a fertility decline can be sustained over a long period if&#13;
there is no demand for family planning services. In Kerala there was&#13;
considerable if latent demand, created by a low level of infant mortality and&#13;
a high level of female education. Therefore, Kerala's family planning&#13;
program has been much more successful than similar programs in the other&#13;
States of India.&#13;
Yet, even with the success achieved in mortality reduction and&#13;
educational improvement, the desired family size (and actual fertility) may&#13;
not reach replacement level in Kerala. Generating additional demand for&#13;
fertility control depends on introducing some system of old age security. At&#13;
present, almost all Kerala couples expect to depend on their children in&#13;
their old age. Unless alternate provisions are made, parents will have no&#13;
other option and will therefore continue to desire a family sufficiently&#13;
large to ensure at least one surviving son. Kerala can expect a period of&#13;
stagnant fertility rates until such time as alternate social security&#13;
arrangements are provided.&#13;
Policy Implications&#13;
Kerala's fertility decline has received worldwide attention, mainly&#13;
because of the seemingly unfavorable circumstances in which it took place.&#13;
Low per capita income and low levels of industrialization, urbanization,&#13;
and nutrition do not generally go hand in hand with a rapid fall in&#13;
fertility. Our analysis has shown, however, that a high degree of economic&#13;
progress is not a necessary condition for reducing fertility; such a decline&#13;
can indeed take place in low-income populations largely dependent on&#13;
agriculture or other primary occupations. The Kerala study corroborates the&#13;
"reappraisal" of theories of fertility decline made by Freedman (1979).&#13;
Freedman postulates that fertility decline takes place in response to&#13;
an increase in the cost of bringing up children relative to the benefits from&#13;
them, combined with exposure to contraceptive knowledge and services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
An increase in the cost of bringing up children can come about in several&#13;
ways; in Kerala it resulted from the increase in children surviving t-c schcol&#13;
age and the need to educate these children to increasingly higher leve½l of&#13;
attainment. Because of these changes, and because of an egalitarian distrl=&#13;
bution of government services, Kerala has wetnessed a marked decline in&#13;
fertility in recent years - without a high per capita income, or urban!.za-&#13;
tion, or industrialization.&#13;
Has Kerala's experience any relevance to other States in IncliLa?&#13;
The answer depends on whether the determinants of Kerala's fertility decline&#13;
are generalizableo To the extent that historical developments t-sere as&#13;
critical a factor as recent policy interventions in bringing down the birth&#13;
rate, the experience is not entirely replicable elsewhere,    At the same time,&#13;
there are certain lessons to be learned from an analysis of the determinants&#13;
of Kerala's fertility decline that are broadly applicable. These can be&#13;
useful in reorganizing the Indian family planning program and in workVng out&#13;
a long-term strategy for ensuring a sustained fertlf1ty reduction in other&#13;
States as well0&#13;
First, a government-sponsored family planning program can make a&#13;
substantial dent in fertility rates (decreasing them by about 40 percent in&#13;
Kerala during 1968-78), not only among the higher socioe-conomic strata, but&#13;
even more so among the lower strata0   Within limits, the normal posill.ve&#13;
association between socio-economic status and family planning acceptance can&#13;
be broken by a good family planning delivery system aided by economic&#13;
incentives. Without economic incentives, however, it may be difficu:t to&#13;
produce an acceptance rate among the poor as high as or close to that of the&#13;
rich.&#13;
Second, the principal socioeconomic determinants of fertility&#13;
decline in Kerala, as in many other populations, have been mortality decline&#13;
and educational improvement, both of which operate by altering the cost-&#13;
benefit ratio of children0   It is unlikely that the major demand-creating&#13;
factors in the other States of India would be much different, Thus, health&#13;
and education are the principal variables to be manipulated to create addli&#13;
tional demand for fertility control0&#13;
Third, the official family planning program has been more effective&#13;
in Kerala than in the other States of :ndia,   One major reason foz this is&#13;
the higher spin-off effect between the program and socioeconomic developments&#13;
relevant to fertility decline (health and education in particular). One&#13;
lesson from this is that the sequence in which policies affecting the deter-&#13;
minants of fertility are implemented is as important as the policen them-&#13;
selveso In Kerala, the steps came in the right orde7-a reduction in infant&#13;
and child mortality, accompanied or followed by an increase in fems,.e educa-&#13;
tion, followed by redistributive policies and finally by the officia- f£aibly&#13;
planning program. The impact of Keralavs family planning program would 'ave&#13;
been much smaller and more temporary had the program been introduced prior to&#13;
a substantial reduction in the infant mortality rate and a substantial&#13;
improvement in female education, In States where the infant mortal`ty rate&#13;
is still above 100 per thousand live births, and where female literacy is&#13;
still below 25 percent, the impact of a similer family planning prouram would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be much more limited. In such States, improvements in health and education&#13;
should be accelerated, not only for their own sake, but also as an essential&#13;
part of a family planning effort.&#13;
Fourth, in spite of a very successful family planning program,&#13;
about 13 percent of the married women of Kerala who do not want any more&#13;
children are not sterilized themselves, nor have a sterilized husband, nor&#13;
are using a contraceptive. One possible reason for such a large unmet demand&#13;
is dislike of the type of family planning methods, especially the terminal&#13;
methods, offered by the program. These women could be brought into the&#13;
program if acceptable, reversible methods were offered. The extent of unmet&#13;
demand is likely to be larger in the other States of India, and the solution&#13;
may also be the same.&#13;
Fifth, land reforms and other redistributive policies help to&#13;
spread small family norms. While their short-term effect on fertility may&#13;
not be great, such reforms have a significant role to play in a long-term&#13;
strategy to reduce fertility. Another equally important social reform is&#13;
provision for old age economic security. In spite of Kerala's advances with&#13;
respect to mortality decline, female education, land reforms, and soon, there&#13;
is very little change in parents' dependence on their own children in their&#13;
old age. This could be an obstacle in the way of further reducing the&#13;
desired family size. A long-term strategy to achieve replacement level&#13;
fertility, whether in Kerala or in any other State in India, cannot ignore&#13;
the need to develop old age social security programs.&#13;
Sixth, an increase in age at marriage played a major role in&#13;
Kerala's fertility decline. The potential for fertility decline in the other&#13;
States of India through increased age at marriage is very great. This is a&#13;
means of fertility reduction which is largely untapped in most of India.&#13;

Part One. Background&#13;
Chapter 2. Kerala State: Geographic and Socioeconomic Background&#13;
The fertility level and trends of a population are closely related&#13;
to its physical environment and socioeconomic milieu. This chapter, there-&#13;
fore, attempts to give a brief description of the physical characteristics of&#13;
Kerala State and of its principal socioeconomic developments, especially&#13;
those relevant to a study of the determinants of fertility.&#13;
Geographic Characteristics&#13;
Kerala is a relatively small State in the southwest corner of the&#13;
Indian subcontinent. It was formed in 1956 out of three separate&#13;
administrative units:   Travancore State in the south, Cochin State in the&#13;
middle, and the Malabar region of the Madras Province in the north.&#13;
Travancore and Cochin were ruled by local maharajas, while Malabar was part&#13;
of British India. Tranvancore and Cochin together account for about 60&#13;
percent of the population of Kerala and 55 percent of its area. Trivandrum&#13;
at the southern end of the State is the political capital of Kerala; it used&#13;
to be the capital of Travancore State.&#13;
Kerala State is a narrow strip of land extending from Kasaragod in&#13;
the north to Trivandrum in the south (about 585 kilometers) and from the&#13;
Western Ghats in the east to the Arabian Sea on the west (about 120&#13;
kilometers at the widest point). Some forty rivers flow from the Ghats to&#13;
the sea, and a chain of backwaters connected by man-made canals runs parallel&#13;
to the sea. The layout of the Ghats, the course of the rivers, and the&#13;
location of the lagoons divide the State into three natural regions:&#13;
lowland, midland, and highland. With an average rainfall of about 300&#13;
centimeters and an average temperature of 90°F (ranging from 70°F to 95°F),&#13;
the land is fertile and perennially green. Paddy fields, coconut groves,&#13;
banana gardens, tea and rubber estates, and tropical forests abound.&#13;
Although the land is fertile and water is plentiful, Kerala has&#13;
been a food-deficit area since the turn of the century, if not earlier.&#13;
There are two reasons for this. First, the man-land ratio is very small.&#13;
The cultivable land per person is only 0.21 acres. Second, not all&#13;
cultivable land is used for food production. More area could be brought&#13;
under grain cultivation, but only at the expense of the more profitable&#13;
commercial cultivation of coconuts, sugar cane, bananas, and other crops. As&#13;
a result, Kerala is likely to remain a food-deficit State for years to come.&#13;
The heavy rain and the fast-flowing rivers provide ideal conditions&#13;
for the production of hydroelectric power. Kerala is one of the few States&#13;
in India where there is no power shortage. In fact, the State generates more&#13;
hydroelectric power than it can currently consume, and the excess is sold to&#13;
neighboring States. Almost all villages in Kerala are electrified, although&#13;
the proportion of households with electricity is relatively small in most&#13;
villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Kerala is noted for the cleanliness of its land and people. The&#13;
abundance of fresh water is an important contributory factor. The annual&#13;
floods brought by the southwest and northeast monsoons flush out the&#13;
countryside every year, helping to keep both land and people healthy.&#13;
The State is endowed with good transportation networks--waterways,&#13;
roadways, and railways. The rivers and lagoons are navigable and provide&#13;
cheap inland water transport. The roadways (about 90,000 kilometers, or 2.3&#13;
kilometers per square kilometer of the State) connect most villages and towns&#13;
and are the principal means of intrastate transport, while the railways (886&#13;
kilometers) are the principal means of interstate transport. The most&#13;
popular mode of travel in the State is the government bus service, which is&#13;
extensive and highly subsidized. In 1979/80 this system had a route length&#13;
of 159,000 kilometers (4 kilometers per square kilometer of the State),&#13;
operated 224 million kilometers (9 kilometers per inhabitant a year), and&#13;
carried 706 million passengers (28 trips per inhabitant a year). 1/&#13;
One of the six international airports of India (Trivandrum) and two&#13;
domestic airports are located in Kerala, as is the major seaport of Cochin.&#13;
With the many transport facilities available, it is no wonder that Kerala's&#13;
people are highly mobile, migrating to all parts of India and to many other&#13;
countries as well.&#13;
Socioeconomic Development&#13;
In the theoretical framework adopted by this study (see Chapter 9),&#13;
it is argued that the fertility decline that took place in Kerala in recent&#13;
years was caused as much by historical developments as by recent policy&#13;
interventions. Kerala's history prepared the ground whereby a fertility&#13;
decline became possible and desirable for a majority of the people. Recent&#13;
policy interventions then precipitated that decline.&#13;
From the very beginning of its history, Kerala has had extensive&#13;
contacts with other cultures, both within and outside India. These contacts&#13;
have played a significant part in the socioeconomic development of the&#13;
State. From the other side of the Ghats came the caste and land tenure&#13;
systems; from West Asia came Christianity, Islam, and Judaism; from Europe&#13;
also came Christianity, as well as a modern administrative system, the&#13;
plantation industry, modern education, public health, and so on.&#13;
The Aryans, arriving two or three centuries before the Christian&#13;
era, introduced the caste system, a dominant socioeconomic and political&#13;
force even today. The system used to be so rigid that people of lower castes&#13;
could not come closer than a prescribed minimum distance (from 24-72 feet,&#13;

depending on the caste) when approaching those of higher castes (Menon&#13;
1979). 2/&#13;
European influence began with the arrival of the Portuguese in&#13;
14980  The Portuguese were followed by the Dutch (1602), the French (.644)9&#13;
and later the British. The political connection with Britain ended with&#13;
Indian Independence in August 1947.&#13;
These foreign contacts have left some permanent marks on the&#13;
population of Kerala0   The State has a fairly balanced religious and caste&#13;
composition that includes Nairs, Ezawas, Christians, and Muslims0    As a&#13;
result, no one group can profit at the expense of anothero    Rgther than&#13;
forming permanent alliances, the various groups shift their allegiances to&#13;
suit their self-interests. The characteristic instability of the elected&#13;
government and the give-and-take policies of each administration can '3e&#13;
traced to a large extent to the balanced religious and caste composition of&#13;
t.he population0&#13;
Historically, what most distinguished Kerala from the rest of India&#13;
were its achievements in the fields of health and education0 The uodern&#13;
formal educational system in the State owes its origin to the British rule in&#13;
India and to the Christian missionaries who, finding a sizable Chzistian&#13;
population in the State, concentrated their efforts on education and health&#13;
instead of proselytizing. Fortunately, the indigenous tradition was&#13;
favorable to education and the local rulers were supportive; by the end of&#13;
the nineteenth century every village in Kerala had a primary school0 3/&#13;
The influence of Europeans on health was siilear to that on educa-&#13;
tion. They provided the initial impetus for development of a health care&#13;
system, whereupon the indigenous tradition of scientiflc medicine and the&#13;
wholehearted support of the maharajas carried the development forward0 4/&#13;
2/   One saving factor was that in case a lower-caste pXeson came too&#13;
close, the person who was polluted could cleanse himeelf with a simp;'. bath0&#13;
Because of this, many people in Kerala must have spent great amounts of time&#13;
taking baths! Unintentionally, this caste rule and the resulting bz'.hs could&#13;
have been one of the factors accounting for the low mortality found in&#13;
Kerala.&#13;
3/  In 1817 the Maharani of Travancore announced that the State should&#13;
defra7y the entire cost of the education of its people (Nag 1981D po 32).&#13;
4/  "I take this opportunity earnestly to impress this fact on the rinds&#13;
of all my native subjects and to urge them to seelk for themselves, 9 r their&#13;
children, for their friends and for their servants the great protection of&#13;
vaccination. They will see the strength of my conviction in the fgect that&#13;
there is no member of my family who has not had thic protection conf%zred at&#13;

ceremonial opening of the Trivandrum Civil Hospital (WNgam Aiya 190W     pp.&#13;
524-25).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
It is against this historical background that recent socioeconomic&#13;
developments and policy interventions are best viewed. The remainder of this&#13;
chapter describes very briefly developments in four areas of particular&#13;
relevance to fertility -- health, education, political awareness, and land&#13;
reform. The official family planning program is described in the next&#13;
chapter, following a presentation of Kerala's demographic characteristics.&#13;
Health&#13;
The physical environment in most parts of Kerala is healthy and has&#13;
always been so, except for the malarial tracts in the hills (malaria has now&#13;
been eradicated). Kerala also has a long tradition of medical and health&#13;
treatment (Ayurvedic system). The rulers of the State have always taken an&#13;
interest in health matters and have committed sufficient public funds for&#13;
both curative and preventive medicine. In addition, the foreign missionaries&#13;
established private hospitals and trained health personnel.&#13;
Health conditions in Kerala have always been better than those in&#13;
other parts of India, but recent developments have accentuated the disparity.&#13;
The extent of this difference is indicated by the infant mortality rate,&#13;
which in 1980 was about 45 per thousand live births in Kerala and 125 in&#13;
India. The chance of an infant dying during the first twelve months of life&#13;
in India today is about three times the corresponding chance in Kerala. The&#13;
continued improvement in the health of the people has been tied to their&#13;
educational attainments (as discussed below) and to health policies which&#13;
have brought medical facilities within both their reach and their means.&#13;
The hospitals in Kerala are evenly distributed throughout the&#13;
State. Statistics for 1979/80 indicate that the average service area of a&#13;
Primary Health Center was 232 square kilometers in Kerala and 563 square&#13;
kilometers in India; that of a subcenter was 21 square kilometers in Kerala&#13;
and 63 square kilometers in India (Table 2.1). The number of hospital beds&#13;
per 100,000 population was 458 in the urban areas of Kerala (263 in urban&#13;
India) and 107 in the rural areas (12 in rural India). The easy access to&#13;
medical facilities (due to the relatively small service area and good&#13;
transport facilities), the relatively low cost of medical services, and the&#13;
high demand for them (due to a more educated population) are all important&#13;
reasons for the comparatively better health conditions in Kerala than in&#13;
other States in India.&#13;
Education&#13;
The contrast between Kerala and India is equally striking with re-&#13;
spect to educational attainment. In 1981 about 70 percent of the people in&#13;
Kerala were literate compared with 36 percent in India (Table 2.2). Among&#13;
females, the rates were 66 percent for Kerala and 25 percent for India.&#13;
These differentials are not merely a carryover from historical differences,&#13;
which were quite large. The improvement in literacy levels in the decade&#13;
1971-81 was greater in Kerala than in India (10.0 percentage points com-&#13;
pared to 6.7).&#13;

The development of education in the State owes much to the&#13;
importance given it in the Kerala culture and to the work done by the&#13;
European missionaries. Historically, education was provided using temples as&#13;
centers, with nonformal lessons imparted to both men and women through&#13;
puranic stories (Hindu epics) and devotional songs (Nag 1981, pp. 31-32).&#13;
More recently the rulers of both Travancore and Cochin gave considerable&#13;
impetus to education by having the State pay the entire cost of primary&#13;
education. These official efforts were supplemented by private efforts which&#13;
began with the foreign Christian missionaries' establishment of&#13;
church-managed schools and colleges. The first Christian college (at&#13;
Kottayam) was established in 1813.&#13;
The improvement in the literacy rate alone does not give a full&#13;
picture of the educational "explosion" in Kerala since 1950. Data on the&#13;
number of students at all levels, and on the number of schools and colleges&#13;
of all types, are necessary to round out this picture.&#13;
Table 2.3 presents statistics on the formal channels of education,&#13;
that is, the schools and colleges managed by the government, by private&#13;
persons, or by organizations, and recognized by the appropriate government&#13;
agencies (Kerala State Education Department or University). There are a&#13;
large number of other educational institutions as well, including tutorial&#13;
colleges and "parallel" colleges. The parallel colleges in Kerala are a&#13;
unique institution. While the tutorial colleges take students who fail in&#13;
public examinations, the parallel colleges take students who fail to gain&#13;
admission to a recognized institution. Such students can study in parallel&#13;
colleges and take the same examinations which students from recognized&#13;
institutions take. If they pass, they get the same degree or diploma as the&#13;
regular students. Thus, through the system of parallel colleges, a higher&#13;
level of education, especially in liberal arts subjects, is made accessible&#13;
to people from all walks of life.&#13;
Formal schools and colleges, as Table 2.3 indicates, are more&#13;
easily accessible to people in Kerala than in India. Although the average&#13;
population served by a school is greater, Kerala State spends a much higher&#13;
proportion of its revenue for education than does India. Furthermore, the&#13;
State spends proportionately more money on primary education than on higher&#13;
levels of education compared to India.&#13;
Two aspects of these educational developments are particularly&#13;
relevant to the fertility decline. First, education is so widespread that&#13;
there are very few illiterate men or women in the prime childbearing ages.&#13;
Second, the supply of educated personnel has been far in excess of demand, so&#13;
that the problem of educated unemployment is becoming progressively worse.&#13;

Every aspect of life in Kerela ic polf.TYci.edo RcewspseT Teading&#13;
and political discussions are principal pastimes of the everage p29con. Pro-&#13;

For some people, participation in processions md protect meetings is e&#13;
full=timz job.&#13;
Such politici2ing has many disruptive conosquenceso, but it is not&#13;
without beneficial effect. As Wencher tz?@its:o&#13;

There is no question that politicisation of people in Kerala has&#13;
played a major part in affecting people's health [for the&#13;
better] ...In Kerala, if a PHC [Primary Health Centre) was un-manned&#13;
for a few days, there would be a massive demonstration at the&#13;
nearest collectorate [a collector is the chief administrator of a&#13;
district] led by local leftists, who would demand to be given what&#13;
they knew they were entitled to. This has had the effect of making&#13;
health care much more readily available for the poor in Kerala.&#13;
(pp. 1781-82)&#13;
This is true not only for health services, but for all public&#13;
services including education, rural bus service, postal service, food&#13;
distribution, construction and maintenance of roads and bridges, and even&#13;
contraceptive supplies and family planning services.5/ The political&#13;
awareness and the politicization of all issues, even those affecting only a&#13;
small minority of the population, may be responsible for better delivery of&#13;
government services than would otherwise be the case. Newspapers and&#13;
political leaders explain the services and benefits available, along with the&#13;
eligibility requirements. And what people are eligible for, they obtain - by&#13;
application, appeal, or agitation.&#13;
Land Reform and Other Redistribution Policies&#13;
Undoubtedly the most significant development in the recent&#13;
political economy of the State is the shift in political power from the rich&#13;
to the poor. Along with this shift, and as a consequence of it, there has&#13;
been a considerable transfer of wealth and income to the lower strata of&#13;
society. These changes have been brought about through land reform, job&#13;
security, enforcement of minimum wages, pension benefits for agricultural&#13;
laborers, reservation of places in educational institutions and on public&#13;
bodies (including the legislature and the cabinet) for the economically and&#13;
socially backward groups in the community, and similar policies.&#13;
Land reform was the principal means used to bring about a major&#13;
redistribution of wealth. The first post-Independence legislative measure&#13;
on land reform was adopted in 1957. It sought to assure permanent tenure to&#13;
all tenants, to give tenants the right to purchase their land, and to impose&#13;
a ceiling on the total acreage a primary family unit could own. The proposal&#13;
aroused considerable opposition, and as a result of the agitation which&#13;
5/ A recent report in India Today (March 31, 1983, p. 33) illustrates&#13;
this joint. A resident of Kozhencherry village in Kerala became tired of&#13;
waiting for his phone to be installed. He took his concerns to the High&#13;
Court where the decision was in his favor: the junior engineer of the phone&#13;
exchange was ordered to install the phone immediately. When no action&#13;
ensued, the villager again went to court, and the engineer was cited for&#13;
contempt. Finally, the phone was installed; however, the court remained&#13;
unsatisfied, and in January 1983 found that the engineer had wantonly&#13;
disregarded the original order. The court demanded that the engineer make an&#13;
apology in public "as a deterrent to those who treat the orders of the court&#13;
with callous disregard and indifference."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16 &#13;
followed, the government was dismissed. The Land Re,forvs Act weas fialLy&#13;
passed in 1963, although its actual implementation was delayed severaL years&#13;

fear of eviction and begin to cultivate fruit trees and vegetables on their&#13;
household plots. These workers have also benefited from the Minimum Wage Act&#13;
and other agrarian reforms that fix wages and conditions of work for all&#13;
agricultural operations. The gains from higher daily wages have been partly&#13;
offset, however, by losses due to reductions in the number of days a wage&#13;
earner can find work and in employment opportunities for other family&#13;
members, especially grown children.&#13;
...it is only in Kuttanad (Alleppey District) that I have heard&#13;
workers talk about time spent harvesting in terms of 45 minutes or&#13;
1.5 hours (rather than in terms of days or at least half days as&#13;
they do elsewhere). (Mencher 1980, p. 1787)&#13;
Given this situation, it is doubtful that the increase in the minimum wage is&#13;
fully reflected in a higher average annual household income for agricultural&#13;
laborers.&#13;

Chapter 3. Kerala State: Demographic and Family Planning BacKground&#13;
Kerala has a very dense population scattered fairly uniformly over&#13;
the State, with few nodes of concentration. The population is rather well&#13;
advanced in its demographic transition, with a high but rapidly declining&#13;
rate of population growth, a high average age at marriage, a high level of&#13;
family planning practice, a relatively low and declining fertility rate, a&#13;
very low and very slowly declining mortality rate, and a high degree of&#13;
population mobility. As noted in Chapter 2, the population is also fairly&#13;
well advanced with regard to literacy and educational attainment, but it is&#13;
only moderately successful in its economic transition, with nearly half the&#13;
labor force still dependent on agriculture and a third dependent on daily&#13;
wages from farming. Kerala's demographic profile as well as the official&#13;
family planning program are described in some detail below.&#13;
Population Trends&#13;
Until recently Kerala's rate of population growth has always been&#13;
higher than that of India (Table 3.1). Between 1901 and 1981 the State's&#13;
population grew by 297 percent while that of India grew by only 187 percent.&#13;
For the decade 1971-81, however, Kerala's annual growth rate of 1.7 percent&#13;
was substantially lower than India's rate of 2.2 percent. Since the&#13;
prospects for further decline in Kerala's growth rate are good, its&#13;
proportional contribution to the population of India is likely to diminish in&#13;
the years to come.&#13;

Distribution&#13;
The State is divided into administrative districts, the number of&#13;
which has recently been increased from 12 to 14, with Trivandrum the most&#13;
southern and Cannanore the most northern. The population, density, and&#13;
growth rate of these districts are shown in Annex Table 1. The districts&#13;
vary in population size from half a million in Wynad to 2.8 million in Quilon&#13;
and Cannanore. The density also varies substantially, from 192 persons per&#13;
square kilometer in Idukki to 1,244 in Alleppey. The main reason for this&#13;
variation is differences in topography.&#13;
Kerala is not a highly urbanized state. In 1981 only 18.7 percent&#13;
of its population lived in urban areas, compared with 23.7 percent in India&#13;
as a whole. There is no city in the State with a population of a million or&#13;
more. The largest urban agglomeration is Cochin, with a total population of&#13;
686,000 in 1981; only six other towns have a population over 100,000, and&#13;
only two of these have a population over 600,000. 1/&#13;
One of the distinguishing features of Kerala is the absence of&#13;
rural-urban distinctions. There is no village system as is common in other&#13;
States of India, nor any locality concept of a village. Houses are not&#13;
clustered but scattered, with plenty of space in between the structures and&#13;
with compound walls often separating them, in spite of the high density. The&#13;
villages are administrative divisions only, with large populations compared&#13;
to the Indian norm. Table 3.2 gives the distribution of villages by&#13;
population size in Kerala and India. The contrast is very vivid.&#13;

Fertility&#13;
The crude birth rate in Kerala was about 40 per thousand&#13;
population before 1950, but it i probably below 25 now. The trend lo chown&#13;
in Table 3.3. The birth rate started declining in the early 1950s, :nt this&#13;
trend gathered momentum only in the second half of the 1960s.&#13;
The fertility rates associated wRteh these birth rates are ohoxn in&#13;
Table 3.4. The total fertility rate use about 502 in 1959 and 3.4 in 1976, a&#13;
decline of about 35 percent02/ In absolute terms, thic is equivalent to a&#13;
decline of 1.8 children per woman. From 1959 to 1971 the lazgest fertility&#13;
decline was in the 15-19 age group, due largely to a decline in the&#13;
proportion of this age group that was arriied. The varying declines noted&#13;
among other age groups during 1971=76 should he due primarily to&#13;
contraceptive practice. The fertility declines at older ages were very&#13;
pronounced and may reflect the increasing frequency of sterilization among&#13;
these women.&#13;

Mortality&#13;
Kerala's death rate has always been much lower then that of .?ndiao&#13;
The crude death rate was estimated to be about 25 per thousand populc, 7.on in&#13;
the TL930s and about 7 in 1979, Much of the decline took place ba,fcrn °.970&#13;
(see Table 3.5),  The largest gain over mortality waus experienced ln 'he&#13;
infant ages. Reliable estimates of the infant xLortslity rate foT earL..er&#13;
periods are lacking, 3/ but the estimates for 1951-60 onuard are glven in&#13;
Table 3.6. The rate has been less than 50 ln recent yearso&#13;
The difference between India and Kerala wlth respect to lfniant&#13;
mortality is very large indeed. For every thousand live birthS in           0 D0&#13;
more babies died in India during the first year of Life than in XsT'&gt; ,n   To&#13;
put it another way, a baby's chance of dying in Indic during the i1r-&lt;: ysEr&#13;
is almost three times as great as that of a baby born in Kerala.&#13;
Official estimates indicate that in the 1930s life etecanny     a&#13;
birth in Merala was at the same level as in India, about 32 or 33 ycs&gt;9:; now&#13;
Keralals life expectancy of 65 years is about ten years higherz than ahat of&#13;

Migration&#13;
Migration is a relatively small factor affecting the size and&#13;
distribution of population in Kerala; nevertheless, migration is a very&#13;
important aspect of the socioeconomic life of the State.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24 -&#13;
Until 1931 more people came to Kerala than left0 Since WHorld War&#13;
II the trend has reversed, and Kerala has become a State of net&#13;
out-migrationo The first Census of Kerala (1961) showed that 624,000&#13;
Kerala-born people were living outside the State, while 233,000 outside-born&#13;
people were living in the State, making a net lifetime loss of 391,000. By&#13;
1981 these numbers had increased to 1.A milion, 356,000, and 756,000&#13;
respectively.&#13;
For more recent periods, emigration to West Asian countriec has&#13;
become an important component of migration from Kerala0 Although the volume&#13;
is not so large as the volume of out-migratLon to other parts of India (one&#13;
estimate puts 208,000 Kerala migrants outside India and 302,000 outside&#13;
Kerala but within India), the economic and social impact of '^Aest Asian&#13;
emigration is much larger, The remittances to Kerala alone are estimated to&#13;
be about US$200 million annually.&#13;
Internal migration, even rural-urban migration, is not very great&#13;
in Kerala0 This apparent lack of mobility is more than compensated by the&#13;
increasing volume of commuting, particularly daily commuting for work and&#13;
studies. A very rough indication of the magnitude of such commuting is given&#13;
by the fact that the government bus transport service alone carried each&#13;
person in Kerala an average of about six times a year in 1960, 15 times a&#13;
year in 1970, and 28 times a year in 1980 (Government of Kerala, Directorate&#13;
of Economics and Statistics, 1980, Table 12.7). Because of the cheap&#13;
transportation service, commuting has replaced internal migration in the&#13;
Stateo&#13;
Family Planning Program&#13;
The family planning program in Kerala 'aas developed more or less&#13;
along the same lines as elsewhere in India0 But over the course of years the&#13;
State has evolved certain innovative strategies, like the mass camps, w hich&#13;
were later adopted in other parts of the countryo&#13;
The program made a very modest beginning in 1955 with eleven&#13;
Family Planning Clinics attached to medical institutions0    The course of&#13;
progress since then falls into four distinct phesesg a period of slow growth&#13;
(1955-64); a period of reorganization and the establishment of statewide&#13;
Family Planning Centers (1964'70); t:he years of the mas sterilization camps&#13;
(1970=73), and a period of intensified maternal and child health services&#13;
(1973 onward)o&#13;
Development of the Progr&#13;
During the first phase of development, a State Fgamily ?lanning&#13;
Board was constituted (1958) to develop the policies and procedzAreS of the&#13;
program and to ensure their implementation0   During the period '1956-61, 70&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Family Planning Clinics were opened in the State, with facilities for&#13;
sterilization in 53 institutions. During the next four years (1961-65), 50&#13;
more clinics started functioning, and Family Planning Centers were opened in&#13;
93 panchayats.4/ In each of these centers, two social workers (one male and&#13;
one female) were entrusted with the task of family planning education. The&#13;
supervision of the program was vested in three new Regional Family Planning&#13;
Officers. Later, 20 more facilities were opened and incentives for promoters&#13;
and doctors were introduced. At various levels, committees were formed to&#13;
help in the activities of the Family Planning Centers.&#13;
In 1964, on the basis of recommendations made by the Mukerjeo&#13;
Committee, which was set up by the Government of India to review the&#13;
organization and management of the family planning program, a network of&#13;
service units and a hierarchy of administrative posts were established. A&#13;
District Family Welfare Bureau at the District Headquarters, a State Family&#13;
Welfare Bureau at the Directorate of Health Services, and a cell in the State&#13;
Secretariat also started functioning. Under this new arrangement, urban&#13;
centers were attached to various medical instituions. In rural areas a&#13;
Family Planning Center was established in each Primary Health Center (PHC),&#13;
and under each PHC, subcenters -- one per 10,000 population -- were opened.&#13;
It was during this second phase that IUD and oral contraceptive programs were&#13;
started.&#13;
The third phase, covering the period from the end of 1970 to April&#13;
1973, saw the conduct of mass sterilization camps. These camps not only&#13;
proved to be pacesetters for the country as a whole, but were responsible in&#13;
large measure for the popularity of sterilization in Kerala. Nine month-long&#13;
camps were held during these years in seven of the then eleven districts in&#13;
the State. The most ambitious and impressive in terms of achievement were&#13;
the three camps in Ernakulam District (one of the districts included in the&#13;
present survey), where the target was 85,000 sterilizations and the actual&#13;
total was 93,254 sterilizations (110 percent of the target). Impressive&#13;
results were also achieved in Palghat, another survey district, where the&#13;
number of sterilizations (10,083) represented 101 percent of the target&#13;
figure of 10,000. Although no camps were held in Alleppey, the third survey&#13;
district, 25 percent of the acceptors in the second Ernakulam camp were from&#13;
Alleppey.&#13;
An evaluation of the performance of the first two camps in&#13;
Ernakulam revealed that the camps reached 22.5 percent of the couples in the&#13;
district with two or more children. The camps demonstrated that what could&#13;
4/ A panchayat is the smallest administrative subdivision into which a&#13;
district is divided. By 1982 the total number of Family Welfare Centers and&#13;
Subcenters, formerly called Family Planning Centers and Subcenters, had risen&#13;
to 1,485.&#13;

normally be achieved during a five-year period of official progra&amp;. actlvlties&#13;
could be accomplished in a single one-month camp,&#13;
The camps, however, had repercussions for subsequent program&#13;
performance.   In Ernakulam District, the average number of sterL:lzatlon&#13;
operations annually during the two-year period before the camps was 9,400;&#13;
after the camps it fell to 5,5000 But the dTrop wFas of short duration,&#13;
lasting only two years. The Kerala experience showed that camps were a&#13;
practical means to increase family planning acceptance0&#13;
The fourth phase of the historica2. development of the family&#13;
planning program began with the abandonment of mass camps In 1973. This&#13;
period is marked by greater integration of maternal and child health (MCH)&#13;
services with an intensified family planning program, and by minlcamps.&#13;
Arrangements were made to ensure that the benefits of the MOC and nutrition&#13;
programs reached the people in urban areas through the Family Planning&#13;
Centers and those in rural areas through the subcenters. Facililes for&#13;
female sterilization were extended to rural and semiurban areaso SoEs other&#13;
features of the family planning progran, like the hospital postpaztum program&#13;
and the medical termination of pregnancy, were also made avallabel   during&#13;
this phase of developmento&#13;
In 1976 a new and simple technique of female sterilization known as&#13;
minilaporactomy was introduced in the State. 1This technique, uhi?ch can be&#13;
used at any time on a nonpostpartum basis and without hospitalization, has&#13;
become very popular.&#13;
The oral pill program was sterted in 1968-69 as a pilot project in&#13;
a few selected centers0 It now operates in 163 rural and 42 urban Family&#13;
Planning Centers, but the number of wfomen who have accepted the pills was&#13;
only 1,071 during 1975-76 and 271 during 1979-80o Gral pills are also&#13;
distributed in nine other centers administered by eight voluntary&#13;
organizations and one local body0&#13;
Another innovation during this fourth phase was the mzltipurpose&#13;
Health Workers Scheme0 According to this arrangement, the exiseting lowxer-&#13;
level staff of various centers are pooled and designated as Male and Female&#13;
Health Workerso  Each of these health workers covers a population of 5,000 to&#13;
7,000 and serves all the health needs of thase people. The offer of&#13;
integrated health services is effected at both the peripheral and supervisory&#13;
levelso  The scheme has been introduced in tuo districts of the Rtate.&#13;
The conduct of Family Welfare Fortnights, two uesks sst aside once&#13;
a year by the State government to promote the family plenning pzogram, has&#13;
been a regular feature since 1966. Their observance helps to create an&#13;
awareness of the population problem among the family planning woyoreSr and&#13;
encourages their enthusiasm for the   orEk0  Since 1974 the fortnights have&#13;
also been used for conducting minicamps, which are held by each of the&#13;
Primary Health Centers or by a group of Centers that pool their rneoures0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Delivery of Services&#13;
The State Ministry of Health guides and supervises the family&#13;
planning program in the State. A State Cabinet Subcommittee on Family&#13;
Welfare develops policies and reviews program progress, while a Family&#13;
Welfare Council consisting of official and nonofficial members with the&#13;
Health Minister as chairman serves an advisory function. A Deputy Secretary,&#13;
under the guidance of the Secretary to Government, State Health Department,&#13;
has overall responsibility for the program. Technical supervision is vested&#13;
with the Director of Health Services at the state level, and with the&#13;
District Medical Officer at the district level. The State Family Welfare&#13;
Bureau and District Family Welfare Bureau are in direct charge of the work&#13;
(Figure 3.1).&#13;
Delivery of the many family planning services is centered around&#13;
the various types of activities undertaken by the subcenters, the Primary&#13;
Health Centers (rural and urban), District Hospitals, and other hospitals&#13;
attached to Medical Colleges. At the subcenter level, couples are advised&#13;
about the Family Welfare Program, and conventional contraceptives are&#13;
distributed. Each subcenter is managed by an Auxilliary Nurse Midwife who&#13;
has both clinical and extension work training. She assists the Medical&#13;
Officer in IUD insertions and follows up with the acceptors. During her&#13;
routine house visits, she advises and guides mothers and children on&#13;
nutrition, sanitation, immunization, and the importance of limiting family&#13;
size.&#13;
At the Primary Health Centers, besides distribution of conventional&#13;
contraceptives, there are facilities for vasectomy operations and IUD&#13;
insertions (in a limited number of PHCs, the tubectomy operation is also&#13;
done). A Medical Officer, who may be male or female, provides the necessary&#13;
leadership, ensures coordination of work among the staff, maintains liaison&#13;
with other agencies, and ensures that supplies of medicines and&#13;
contraceptives are available. Organizing minicamps and training camps,&#13;
performing vasectomies, and providing follow-up services also fall within the&#13;
Medical Officer's responsibility. A female Medical Officer assists the&#13;
Medical Officer in meeting the needs of the community and in educating the&#13;
public about family planning.&#13;
With the increased attention to extension activities, the budget of&#13;
the program has been increased from year to year. The expenditure during&#13;
1958-59 was just under Rs. 200,000; by 1964-65 (the year of a major&#13;
reorganization) it rose to Rs. 3,680,000, and it has shown a steadily upward&#13;
trend ever since. The total expenditure for 1979-80 was Rs. 55,550,000 (or&#13;
about US$6 million).5/&#13;

Over the years the major portion of the budget for the Family&#13;
Welfare Program has been spent on services rendered. During the period&#13;
1959-76, 85 percent of funding went for this purpose; the comparable figure&#13;
for 1976-80 is 91 percent.6/ Administrative and other overhead costs have&#13;
decreased while spending for direct program activities has increased.&#13;
Detailed expenditures since 1952 are given in Annex Table 2.&#13;
Incentives&#13;
An incentive in the context of the Family Welfare Program is the&#13;
direct payment, in money or in goods, by the government or another&#13;
organization to an individual, couple, group, or institution for the purpose&#13;
of promoting contraceptive practice. Incentives are offered to acceptors to&#13;
compensate for the loss of wages in the process of family planning&#13;
acceptance, and they may be offered to the motivators and service-rendering&#13;
personnel as well. Apart from money, incentives have included such items as&#13;
transistor radios, cycles, lunkies, and sarees. Voluntary organizations&#13;
(Lions Club, Rotary Club, and so on) have at times supplemented government&#13;
efforts. The rates for the monetary incentives paid by the government, as&#13;
shown in Tables 3.7 and 3.8, have varied depending on who has received them&#13;
and the type of family planning method adopted. The rates were revised&#13;
upward in 1977.&#13;

Prior to 1977 a fee of Rs. 5 was paid to the motivator for each&#13;
case of sterilization. When the State contribution to the miscellaneous&#13;
purpose fund ceased, however, the payment of this motivation fee was&#13;
droppedo Later it was revived at the rate of Res 3 per case of sterilization&#13;
in conjunction with the minicamps and the Family t^Uelfare Fortnlghts. Again&#13;
in July 1979 the rate of the motivatlon fee was modified:    Rs0 6 was paid for&#13;
all cases of vasectomy promoted and Rs. 3 for all cases of femsle&#13;
sterilization promoted in the camps.&#13;
In 1981 payment of monetary inceantives  as made to Favily Welfare&#13;
personnel for each sterilization done in the camps0    The following rates were&#13;
established:&#13;

At the time of the special Family Welfare Campaign organized from&#13;
January-March 1981, additional incentives were given to acceptors as well as&#13;
to motivators. Accordingly, each acceptor of sterilisation received Rso 10,&#13;
while each promoter of sterilization received a bonus of Re. 4D for a total&#13;
motivation fee of Rs0 10 for each vasectomy and Re0 7 for each female&#13;
sterilizationo Corporation Councils, M unicipai Councils, and the Gurufayur&#13;
Township Committee were aloo asked to pay incentives to all persons who&#13;
underwent sterilizations in their areas at the enhanced rate of Re0 500&#13;
Voluntary organizations contributed additional money or goods eo the&#13;
acceptors and motivators of family planning in their areas0&#13;
In collaboration with the Labor Department a novel scheme called&#13;
the Voluntary Promotors' Scheme, a part of the Employment Generation Scheme,&#13;
was launched during the year 1979=80. Educated, unemployed, satisfied&#13;
acceptors with the prescribed qualifications were selected as Voluntary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Promotors. They were given incentives at the rate of Rs. 10 for each&#13;
sterilization promoted and Rs. 5 for each IUD insertion promoted in the area&#13;
allocated to them. This scheme continued until 1980-81.&#13;
The incentives paid to acceptors, motivators, and the service-&#13;
rendering personnel have greatly asssisted in spreading contraceptive&#13;
practice in the State.&#13;
Impact on Fertility&#13;
A "cafeteria" approach is followed in the State for the delivery of&#13;
supplies and services. A variety of methods are offered to the public for&#13;
their choice after proper consultations: male and female sterilization, IUD,&#13;
conventional contraceptives (condoms, diaphragms, jelly/cream tubes, foam&#13;
tablets), and oral pills. A review of the results over the years shows that&#13;
sterilization is the bulwark of the program. The progress of IUD acceptance&#13;
has been checkered. Conventional contraceptives other than condoms are&#13;
practically unused. Pregnancy termination, though not offered as a family&#13;
welfare measure when introduced in 1972, is becoming more and more popular.&#13;
The number of sterilizations (both male and female) during the&#13;
initial years was small, rising gradually from 679 in 1957 to 21,904 in&#13;
1964. In the years of the mass sterilization camps (1970-73), the annual&#13;
figure exceeded 100,000 several times. The highest number ever recorded&#13;
during a single year was in 1976, when 266,000 sterilizations were done.&#13;
After some slowdown in 1978 and 1979, the 1980 performance was much better,&#13;
reaching a provisional total of about 104,000 sterilizations. The cumulative&#13;
total of all sterilizations done through 1980 is almost 1.5 million.&#13;
Detailing the total number of sterilizations by the sex of the&#13;
acceptor shows some interesting changes over the years. From 1957 to 1973,&#13;
the number of vasectomies (male sterilizations) outnumbered tubectomies&#13;
(female sterilizations), accounting for as much as 84 percent of total&#13;
sterilizations in 1966. But since 1974 there has been a reversal of the&#13;
trend, the number of tubectomies exceeding the number of vasectomies in every&#13;
year except 1976. During 1978-80 the number of tubectomies was more than&#13;
five times the number of vasectomies. The recent spurt in tubectomies is due&#13;
to the introduction of minilaporactomy, which makes female sterilization very&#13;
much simpler than it used to be.&#13;
The IUD was introduced in 1965. After an encouraging initial&#13;
start, acceptance was low by 1973. Some gains were seen from 1974 through&#13;
1976, but since 1977 the number of acceptors has again decreased to below&#13;
20,000 a year.&#13;
The use of conventional contraceptives is mostly confined to&#13;
condoms (Nirodh). Of late, the use of other methods has been practically&#13;
discarded. The number of conventional contraceptives distributed each year&#13;
is converted to the number of users through a norm adopted by the Government&#13;
of India. The norm is applied by dividing the total distribution of condoms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32 &#13;
by 72, of diaphragms by 2, of jelly/cream tubes by 7, and of foEL teblete by&#13;
72. These norms are based on the averege nuAmbr of productas coosry for a&#13;
couple to have complete protection over a year. There has been a steady&#13;
increase in the number of uSers of these methods since 1973, as ic detailed&#13;
in Table 3.9o&#13;
Several factors must be considered when estimating the nubler of&#13;
births averted by acceptcrs of the different methodso    These considerations&#13;
includso  the differential efficiency of the mthodsD the carryover affect of&#13;
soes of the methods, the mortality of either spouse9 the possibility of&#13;
expulsion or removal as in the case of XUDs, ad changes in the age etructure&#13;
of acceptors of IUDs and sterilization (both male and fe~Ele). The estimates&#13;
given in Annex Table 3 are based on the age-spcccfic mariteL ferZility rates&#13;
obtained from the National Sample Survey for 1959°60, adjusted to corzespond&#13;
to a birth rate of 3809 per thousand (eotirated from the Census for&#13;
1951=60)o  These estimates show that by 1978 a total of R,736,OC3 births, and&#13;
by 1980 a total of 2,238,000 births, head been averted in the State0 These&#13;
figures. in turn, are used in Table 3o10 to calculate the impact of the&#13;
family planning program on the crude birth ratea&#13;

Part Two. Major Findings&#13;
The research design of this project involved the collection of&#13;
survey data suitable for an analysis of the determinants of the recent&#13;
fertility decline in Kerala. As pointed out earlier, it was deemed&#13;
consistent with the study's objectives to limit the field investigation to&#13;
three districts of Kerala State - Palghat, Ernakulam, and Alleppey. Each&#13;
,district has its distinctive features. Palghat is the new "rice bowl" of&#13;
Kerala. The economy of the district is marked by the predominance of&#13;
agricultural laborers and the absence of any industry, modern or&#13;
traditional. Ernakulam, with its modern port of -Cochin and large number of&#13;
modern industries, represents the emerging industrial society of Kerala.&#13;
Alleppey is the old rice bowl of Kerala; its economic scene is dominated by&#13;
agricultural laborers. But unlike Palghat, the number of workers in&#13;
traditional industries like coir (making products from coconut fiber) and&#13;
fishing is substantial.    Alleppey was the center of industry, trade, and&#13;
commerce for the former State of Travancore, but it has slipped from its&#13;
prime position with the emergence of Cochin as an important center on India's&#13;
west coast.&#13;
Available data from other sources reveal that the fertility rate in&#13;
Palghat is relatively high. The fertility level of the other two districts&#13;
is low, with only slight differences between them. Service statistics from&#13;
the family planning program in these districts show considerable variation in&#13;
the rate and trend of acceptance, as well as in the mix of various family&#13;
planning methods used.&#13;
From each of these three districts, a sample of about 1,000&#13;
households was selected. The people interviewed included approximately 2,700&#13;
ever-married women, 800 never-married women, 1,000 currently married men, and&#13;
1,000 never-married men. Information about the exact number of households&#13;
covered and the number of respondents by category is given in Table 4.1,&#13;
together with an overview of the types of data collected.&#13;

Induced Abortion&#13;
Until recently induced abortion was illegal in Kerala and&#13;
punishable under the Indian penal code except under special circumstances.&#13;
The law was changed by the Medical Termination Act of India, 1971, which was&#13;
made effective from 1 April 1972. This Act provides for the termination of&#13;
pregnancy if its continuance poses a risk to the life of the pregnant woman&#13;
or a threat of grave injury to her physical or mental health. Since the&#13;
failure of any contraceptive device or method is also a valid reason to&#13;
terminate pregnancy, however, an abortion may be obtained on request, thereby&#13;
aiding population control.&#13;
The medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) is done only in approved&#13;
medical institutions, the number of which has been gradually increased. At&#13;
present, 77 government and 51 private institutions are approved for this&#13;
purpose. Pregnancies which do not exceed 12 weeks may be terminated by one&#13;
registered medical practitioner. Two medical practitioners are required if&#13;
the length of pregnancy is more than 12, but less than 20, weeks.&#13;
The MTP program has been well received, especially by women. From&#13;
a mere 1,084 acceptors in 1972-73, the number rose to 32,597 in 1979-80, as&#13;
shown in Table 3.11. During the course of eight years, over 150,000 persons&#13;
have accepted MTP.&#13;

-    basic demographic information                (8 questions)&#13;
-    information about housing, household&#13;
assets, distance to facilities             (26 questions)&#13;

The fertility data consisted of the number of children ever-born by&#13;
the date of birth of each event. The date of death of each chl.d not&#13;
surviving to the survey date was also reported, thereby yielding information&#13;
on infant and child mortality. With respect to family planninga, he survey&#13;
collected data on knowledge, ever-use, and current use of each [-r."ly&#13;
planning method. Information on marriage included the age at mu.rriage of&#13;
those who were married, and the ideal age at marriage for boys and girls&#13;
according to both married and unmarried adult males and females. In&#13;
addition, information was collected on the reasons for early or .ate&#13;
marriages and on attitudes toward marriage. Finally, informaticn on housing,&#13;
education, caste and related social distinctions, occupation, and income of&#13;
both men and women was included in the survey0&#13;
The field investigation was carried out from January to june 1980&#13;
by a field staff consisting of fifteen female and three male interviewers,&#13;
supervised by staff from the Kerala State Bureau of Economics and&#13;
Statistics. A post-enumeration survey was conducted by the supervisors soon&#13;
after completion of the field work, using a sample of 60 househodes in each&#13;
districto  The results indicated that the data collected were of good&#13;
quality.&#13;
The general methodology adopted for the study of this data was as&#13;
follows:&#13;
First, the fertility level, trend, socioeconomic differentlfals, and&#13;
trends in fertility differentials by socioeconomic group wtere estimated.&#13;
Second, the increase in age at marriage, trend in contraceptive&#13;
practice, and differentials in age at marzIage and contraceptive&#13;
practice were estimated, as well as the impact of increases In the age&#13;
at marriage and in contraceptive practice on fertility tren£ls for recent&#13;
periods0&#13;
Third, a multivariate analysis was carried out in which the dependent&#13;
variables were fertility and fertility-related factors, wh ile the&#13;
independent variables were demographic and socioeconomic £actors&#13;
(individual and household)0&#13;
Fourth, a theoretical framework was proposed to explain the observed&#13;
facts0&#13;
Fifth, the various hypotheses developed on the basIs of the theoretical&#13;
framework were tested using survey data0&#13;
Part Two of this book is a presentation of the findings of the&#13;
fertility survey0   Chapter 4 reports on fertility levels and trZnds ln Kerala&#13;
State, while Chapters 5, 6, and 7 focus on three primary determ-nants of&#13;
fertility trends: desire for children, age at marriage, and fanslD`Sy planning&#13;
practice0  Each of the four chapters in Part Two opens with a listing of the&#13;
principal conclusions suggested by the collected data and then -7oceeds to a&#13;
detailed review of the findings and their relation to a number o` demographic&#13;
and socioeconomic factors0   In addition, summaries are provided of the&#13;
multivariate analyses carried out to help identify which factorr best explain&#13;
the observed differentials0 The description and testing of the Itheoretical&#13;
framework are reserved for Part Three0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Chapter 4. Fertility Trends&#13;
Information on fertility levels and trends is available from two&#13;
questions in the survey: that regarding the age distribution of the&#13;
household, and that regarding children ever-born by date of birth of each&#13;
child, age of woman, and her age at marriage. The survey data show that the&#13;
fertility decline has indeed been substantial. For the period 1975-80 the&#13;
estimated crude birth rate (projected for the State as a whole) was 25, the&#13;
same figure reported for 1978 by the Sample Registration System, a reliable&#13;
source for fertility trends in Kerala State. The principal conclusions&#13;
regarding the fertility trends and differentials for the three survey&#13;
districts are summarized below.&#13;
-    The total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 5.9 in 1965-70 to 3.7&#13;
in 1975-80, a decrease of 38 percent; the marital fertility rate&#13;
(TMFR) declined between the same two periods from about 7.5 to 5.7,&#13;
a decrease of 24 percent.&#13;
-    Cohorts of women born after Indian Independence (1947), who are the&#13;
same as those who got married after the implementation of land&#13;
reforms and intensification of the family planning program in&#13;
Kerala (that is, after 1965), had a distinctly lower fertility&#13;
level than women born before Independence or married before the&#13;
implementation of the land reforms or the intensification of the&#13;
family planning program.&#13;
-    Fertility decline occurred in all major socioeconomic groups--rich&#13;
and poor, educated and illiterate, Hindus and Muslims, Nairs and&#13;
Scheduled Castes.   In general, the decline has been greatest in the&#13;
middle-level socioeconomic group. For example, the fertility&#13;
decline was highest among neither the most nor the least educated&#13;
but among women with 1-4 years of schooling.&#13;
-    Length of schooling of women has had a consistently negative&#13;
relation to fertility, except during 1970-75 when much of the&#13;
fertility decline in the survey districts was due to camp-induced&#13;
sterilizations.&#13;
-    Caste has a statistically significant effect on fertility even when&#13;
controlled for education and all other variables.&#13;
-    There is no evidence of a negative relationship between fertility&#13;
and economic indicators. In general, however, the correlation&#13;

Fertility aatets&#13;
Before trying to understand the determineant of fertility changee&#13;
in a population, it is essential to specify as accurately as pocsible just&#13;
what the fertility changes are. In this sectLon, en effEt is Lmde to&#13;
measure the fertility levels, trends, and differentials in Kerala in recent&#13;
years by deriving them from the collected survey datae A variety of&#13;
measurements is used; taken together, they provide a fairly conn3istent&#13;
picture of the dimensions and characteristics of KerEiala   overall feTtility&#13;
decline.&#13;
Crude Birth Rate&#13;
The age distribution of the household population cen 1m msnipulated&#13;
to derive crude birth rates for recent yearzs    The observed age datc are&#13;
strongly suggestive of a sharp decline in the birth rate in all the survey&#13;
districts0 Table 4o2 gives the proportion of the populeation in the three&#13;
youngest age groups compared with a stable age distribution0     'rfq  percentages&#13;
are relatively low, indicating a fairly lou fertility rate, cloce to a gross&#13;
reproduction rate of 1.5,1/&#13;

How great is the decline in the birth rate, and what is its current&#13;
level? A simple calculation of the birth rate by the reverse survival method&#13;
gives some approximate answers. The results are shown in Table 4.3.&#13;

Notes:&#13;
(1) Reverse survival method using a growth rate of 2 percent and&#13;
mortality levels of 17.2, 18, and 18.8 (South model).&#13;
(2) Reverse survival method (all ages) using mortality alone (same as&#13;
above). Estimates by this method are considered more reliable in this case.&#13;
For the period 1975-80 the crude birth rate for the three districts&#13;
together was only about 22.5 per thousand population, a rate supported by&#13;
both methods. Additional credibility for this rate is obtained by comparipg&#13;
the survey rate with the Indian Government's Sample Registration System (SRS)&#13;
rate, which is an entirely independent source of data for births. Z/ This&#13;
comparison is given in Table 4.4.&#13;

Children Ever-Born&#13;
It is also possible to calculate the fertility rate from children&#13;
ever-born. In the survey, ever-married women were asked the date of birth of&#13;
each of their children in addition to their own dates of birth and marriage.&#13;
The average number of children ever-born (parity) by age of the woman is&#13;
shown in Table 4.6. The average at ages 45-49 is the completed fertility or&#13;
the (cohort) total fertility rate (TFR) of women born during 1930-35.&#13;

The completed fertility of women in the three survey districts&#13;
combined is 5.3, with little variation among the districts. The figure is&#13;
slightly higher in Palghat and lower in Alleppey, the same pattern exhibited&#13;
by the crude birth rate and similar to that exhibited by the standardized&#13;
average parity. (The unstandardized average parity shows a different&#13;
pattern.) These parity data indicate that in the past the total fertility&#13;
rate in Kerala was at least 5.3; that among the three districts studied, the&#13;
fertility level has been highest in Palghat and lowest in Alleppey; and that&#13;
the fertility differentials between the three districts have been relatively&#13;
small.&#13;
All ever-married women in the survey were also classified by&#13;
duration of marriage. The average number of children ever-born in each group&#13;
is given in Table 4.7.&#13;

Fertility Pattern&#13;
The total fertility rate (TFR) for the three survey districts for&#13;
1975-80 is estimated to be about 3.69 (Table 4.8), which is higher than the&#13;
rate in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, or Taiwan, China for recent&#13;
periods.&#13;
Figure 4.1 compares the age pattern of the fertility curve for&#13;
Kerala with those of Indonesia and Sri Lanka using World Fertility Survey&#13;
data. In Kerala the fertility rate reaches its maximum at ages 25-30 years.&#13;
The difference between the rate at ages 25-30 and the rates for neighboring&#13;
age groups is substantial. This is in sharp contrast to the Sri Lanka pat-&#13;
tern, which is more or less flat at ages 20-25, 25-30, and 30-35. Even in&#13;
the age group 35-40 the Sri Lanka rate is not far below the peak value. In&#13;
the younger age groups (15-19 and 20-24), the pattern in Kerala resembles&#13;
that in Sri Lanka but contrasts with that in Indonesia. At older ages, how-&#13;
ever, the Kerala pattern is quite similar to that in Indonesia. In fact, at&#13;
ages above 30 years the curves for Kerala and for Indonesia are identical.&#13;
This is somewhat surprising in view of the differences in the fertility rates&#13;
of these populations (the TFR is 4.97 in Indonesia and 3.69 in Kerala). The&#13;
differences and similarities should be attributable to the causes of the&#13;
fertility decline. Age at marriage, which plays a principal role in fertili-&#13;
ty decline at younger ages, is similar in Kerala and Sri Lanka. At older&#13;
ages, family planning practice is the immediate cause of fertility decline.&#13;
In this respect, Sri Lanka and Kerala differ considerably, both in the extent&#13;
of family planning and the methods used. Hence, the fertility patterns in&#13;
Kerala and Sri Lanka are quite similar at younger ages, but very divergent at&#13;
older ages. The similarities between Indonesia and Kerala at ages above 30&#13;
years should be related to a similarity in the extent and type of family&#13;
planning practice.&#13;

Trends in Fertility Rates&#13;
The total fertility rate for the three districts of Kerala combined&#13;
declined from 5.91 in 1965-70 to 3.69 in 1975-80 (Table 4.8). This means a&#13;
decline of 2.2 children per woman, or of 38 percent over a ten-year period,&#13;
an average decline of 4.7 percent a year. This is an extremely rapid&#13;
decline, but by no means unprecedented. The TFR declined by 5.9 percent a&#13;
year during 1965-70 in Singapore, and by 5.4 percent a year during the same&#13;
period in Hong Kong.   These are small populations, however, compared to that&#13;
of Kerala. In the Republic of Korea, which is larger than Kerala and has a&#13;
strong family planning program, the rate of decline was 2.5 percent a year&#13;
during 1965-76. In Sri Lanka the corresponding rate was 3.0 percent a year&#13;
during 1965-74, and in Taiwan, China it was 2.8 percent a year during&#13;
1965-78. Thus, a reduction of the TFR by 4.7 percent a year for a large&#13;
population like Kerala's is not unprecedented, but nevertheless noteworthy.&#13;
Fertility in Kerala fell fairly uniformly during the period&#13;
1965-80; the decline was 22 percent during 1968-73 and 20 percent during&#13;
1973-78. Figure 4.2 gives a comparative picture of the fertility changes&#13;
between 1965-70 and 1970-75, and between 1970-75 and 1975-80. On the whole,&#13;
the decline was slightly greater during the first five-year period than&#13;
during the second five-year period (1.3 children compared to 0.9 children).&#13;
With the exception of women aged 30-34, all the age groups reflect this&#13;
pattern, suggesting that the decline among older women due to family planning&#13;
seems to have spread to the younger age groups in more recent years.&#13;
The fertility decline has not, however, been uniform across age&#13;
groups in recent years; as Table 4.8 indicates, it was smallest in the 25-29&#13;
age group and largest in the youngest and oldest age groups. In the youngest&#13;
age group, the decline was linked with the marriage factor to a great extent,&#13;
and with family planning to a much lesser extent. In the older age groups,&#13;
the decline was due almost entirely to family planning.&#13;
From the data collected, specific fertility rates can be calculated&#13;
at five-year intervals from 1945-50 onward for ages 15-19 years, from 1950-55&#13;
onward for ages 20-24, and so on. These rates show a continuous decline in&#13;
each age group from 1960-65 on (see Annex Table 5). The trend prior to 1960&#13;
is uncertain. The rates show some increase up to 1960-65, which may reflect&#13;
the true situation, but could also be due to deficiencies in the data.&#13;
Between 1960-65 and 1975-80, the specific fertility rates declined&#13;
by 65 percent at ages 15-19 years, 42 percent at ages 20-24 years, 26 percent&#13;
at ages 25-29 years, and 44 percent at ages 30-34 years. The decline is&#13;
the least at ages 25-29 years.&#13;
The marital fertility rates show much smaller decreases. At&#13;
younger ages there is no decline at all; there are even some observed&#13;
increases, which could be statistical aberrations. At older ages,&#13;
age-specific fertility rates and age-specific marital fertility rates behave&#13;
in a similar manner. One special point to note is that the rates for 1960-65&#13;
and 1965-70 are practically the same in all the age groups for which they are&#13;
available. It would seem accurate to conclude that before 1960 there was&#13;
little decline in marital fertility.&#13;

Cohort Fertility&#13;
Fertility rates for all cohorts are shown in Figure 4.3. A word of&#13;
caution is necessary in interpreting these rates. Cohort fertility is&#13;
complete only when women have passed through the entire childbearing period.&#13;
In our sample, only one cohort has completed the childbearing period, the&#13;
cohort born in 1930-35. For all other cohorts, the evidence is incomplete.&#13;
At one extreme is the group of women born during 1960-65, those who&#13;
were 15-19 years old at the time of the survey. Their fertility experience&#13;
is measured for a maximum of five years and most of their reproductive period&#13;
is still ahead of them. We have assumed that the period fertility rate of&#13;
women during 1975-80 will apply without change to all women who have not&#13;
completed their fertility period. This assumption clearly overestimates the&#13;
fertility rates of recent cohorts (as future fertility is likely to be lower)&#13;
and thus underestimates the fertility differences between older and younger&#13;
women.&#13;
Nevertheless, a few firm conclusions emerge from Figure 4.3.&#13;
First, completed fertility has decreased consistently with a later year of&#13;
birth. It is highest for those born in 1930-35 and lowest for those born in&#13;
1960-65. (No doubt the actual differences between the various cohorts are&#13;
even greater than the figure indicates.) Second, there is a substantial&#13;
difference between the fertility performance of women born before 1945-50 and&#13;
those born after that period. The year of Indian Independence (1947) seems&#13;
to be the great divide. Fertility decline in Kerala started with the cohort&#13;
of women born around the year of Independence. The decline was not, however,&#13;
confined to these women. Those born earlier were also affected by the trend&#13;
and contributed to the fertility decline when the 1945-50 birth cohort&#13;
reached reproductive age (that is, after 1960). Third, the year of marriage,&#13;
rather than the year of birth, could be more relevant in fertility trends.&#13;
For example, in 1960-65 those who were born in 1945-50 would have been 15-19&#13;
years old -- the age at which most women got married at that time. These&#13;
are the years when land reforms were implemented, and when large-scale family&#13;
planning efforts were initiated. Hence, those women who married in 1960-65&#13;
belong to the first marriage cohort affected from the very beginning of their&#13;
married life by the vastly expanded family planning programs and by the&#13;
social changes accompanying land reform as well as other legislative&#13;
reforms. Therefore, fertility rates of this cohort and those following it&#13;
are different from those of previous cohorts. Finally, the trend in&#13;
incompleted fertility is not as systematic as the trend in completed&#13;
fertility. Those women born in 1935-40 had higher fertility rates at ages&#13;
20-24 and 25-29 than those born in 1930-35. Similarly, those born in 1940-45&#13;
had higher fertility rates at ages 15-19 than those born in 1935-40 or&#13;
1930-35. Whether these trends are real or are mere statistical aberrations&#13;
due to errors in the data or to the small sample size is uncertain.&#13;

Fertility Differentials by Socioeconomic Group&#13;
One method of understanding the determinants of fertility changes&#13;
in a population is to examine fertility differentials at a given point in&#13;
time; another is to examine the trends in fertility differentials over a&#13;
period of time. Both approaches are employed here. Fertility measures in&#13;
this section are all for married women only. As the classification of the&#13;
general population by socioeconomic group and marital status is not&#13;
available, it is not possible to convert the marital fertility rates to rates&#13;
for the total population.&#13;
Just as fertility decline has not been uniform across age groups,&#13;
so it has not been uniform across socioeconomic groups. The principal&#13;
objective of this section is to locate those groups which have high or low&#13;
fertility rates, and those groups which have shown a more than average or&#13;
less than average change in fertility rates in recent years. By linking&#13;
these findings with data on family planning use by various groups, it should&#13;
be possible to draw inferences about the determinants of fertility change in&#13;
Kerala in recent years.&#13;
Age At Marriage&#13;
Those who marry early have more children, as shown in Table 4.9.&#13;
On an average, women who married at age 23 or above have only two children&#13;
compared with five for those who married below the age of 15. Part of this&#13;
difference is due to compositional factors; those who marry early have a&#13;
longer married life. The standardized average number of children varies from&#13;
3.8 for early marrying women to 2.6 for late marrying women, or a difference&#13;
of only 1.2 children per woman.&#13;

That there is a real difference in the fertility ?eformence of&#13;
women who marry early and those w3 maxrry late is very clear fzcmr the&#13;
averages within each category of marital duration0   For duration 04 years&#13;
the variation is not systematic, but for longer durations conc:cstent&#13;
differences appear. Thus, for usd,en marriTied 151 years, the average nuuber&#13;
of children born decreases with increasing age eat arriageg    4.5, 4.1, 4oG,&#13;

From this table alone it is difficult to say twhether a tomEn s age&#13;
at marriage has determined her fertility, or tShether a t^nmanlo fertility&#13;
preference has helped decide her age at marriageo    In the survey sample,&#13;
there usre only four respondents married less than five years,    Those who&#13;
married before the age of 15 were all older e^onen, whereas thcoae Tho married&#13;
after the age of 23 were almost all younger   oromen. There tsere only nine&#13;
women tyho married after 23 years of age 25 or more years ago. These nine&#13;
wBomen must have been a highly selective grou? t^ith respect to their fertility&#13;
preference0  Had they married younger, they may not have hed sore children&#13;
than they actually produced.&#13;
Education&#13;
The average number of ch.idren ever'born is lower for the better&#13;
educated than for the illiterate (2.1 for wsomen with ten or more years of&#13;
school and 4,5 for wsomen with no schoolingD Se@ Table 4.J0). Part of the&#13;
difference here too is due to compocitional factors, such as euration of&#13;
marriageo If the averages are standardized "or marttal duration, the&#13;
difference decreases, from 2.4 children before standerdization to 0.8&#13;
children after standardization0&#13;

The average completed fertility (number of children ever-born to&#13;
women married 25 years or more) of the highly educated is 1.4 children less&#13;
per woman than for their counterparts with no schooling (4.4 and 5.8,&#13;
respectively). The decrease in the average number of children with increas-&#13;
ing education of the woman is very systematic in our sample.&#13;
Much of the variation in fertility levels by educational attainment&#13;
is due to differentials in age at marriage, as Annex Table 6 indicates, but&#13;
real differences in fertility do exist between women of different educational&#13;
groups, even when allowance is made for the variance in age at marriage.&#13;
Fertility rates by educational attainment for recent periods are summarized&#13;
in Table 4.11 and given in greater detail in Annex Table 7.&#13;

and inconsistent with the family planning data.&#13;
There are significant differentials and trends in these data, and&#13;
not all are according to expectation. / The overall pattern is that&#13;
fertility has fallen among women of aTl educational levels, but the greatest&#13;
4/ Estimation of the total fertility rate for five-year periods from&#13;
fertiTity history data is subject to considerable error. The rate is&#13;
affected by transfers of birth and/or by the method of calculating the number&#13;
of married women in each five-year period. Errors due to transfers of&#13;
birthsare likely to be small in Kerala for the period 1965-79; the results of&#13;
the post-enumeration survey (PES) showed that dates of birth were accurately&#13;
reported. But the PES showed that the date of marriage was subject to an&#13;
error of one or two years in some cases, and therefore estimates of the&#13;
number of married women in the 15-19 age group for past years are&#13;
unreliable. We have tried to minimize this error by excluding women 15-19&#13;
years and 45-49 years from the calculation of the total marital fertility&#13;
rate (TMFR) and designating this as TMFR'.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54 &#13;
decline has taken place among those with 1-4 years of schooling and the&#13;
smallest among the highly educated. There could be tuo main reacons for&#13;
this0 First, in the past fertility has been highest in the groUp&#13;
with 1-4 years of schooling; therefore, the Scope for decline among them wes&#13;
considerable. Second1, as will be seen later, sterilization has been an&#13;
important factor in fertility decline in Kerala, and the propencity to&#13;
undergo sterilization has been greatest among those with 14 years of&#13;
schoolingo&#13;
Another important fact that emerges from Table 4.11 is that in&#13;
1965-70 fertility among illiterate women was lower than among women with&#13;
either 1-4 or 5-9 years of schooling0 It is possible that such a pattern&#13;
existed in earlier periods as wello Wormally for such groups, fertility&#13;
rises before fallingo   But the trend shown here is clearly downward0   This&#13;
reflects the fact that the potential fertility increase in this group due to&#13;
improvements in health and nutrition was avoided through other means such as&#13;
the birth control program, and particularly through acceptance of&#13;
sterilization0 One might suggest that without an active family planning&#13;
program featuring an incentive system, it ls very unlikely that an increase&#13;
in fertility among women who had never gone to school eould have been&#13;
avoided0  The consistent downward trend in fertility among the Scheduled&#13;
Castes and among the economically disadvantaged groups of the society, as&#13;
discussed below, may well reflect a similar impact of the family planning&#13;
program, made attractive to the poorer segments of the population through&#13;
financial incentives0&#13;
The differentials in specific fertility rates by education have not&#13;
been the same in all age groups (Annem Table 7). Below 30 years of age,&#13;
fertility seems to rise with increased schcoling, especially at low levels of&#13;
education0 Above 30 years of age, fertility declines systematically with an&#13;
increase in schoolingo&#13;
Caste and Religion 5/&#13;
Marriage customs vary considerably from caste to caste in Kerala.&#13;
Similarly, living arrangements for the married couple vary by religious and&#13;
caste group0 The available data suggest that these differences may have a&#13;
significant effect on the number of children born to a woman0&#13;
The average parity of the Nuslim women surveyed was 401, while that&#13;
of the Nairs was only 2.9, a difference of 102 children per woman0 The&#13;
completed fertility of these two groups differs by 2.5 children0 Between&#13;
Nairs and Latin Christians, the difference in completed fertillty is 2.7&#13;
children (Table 4.12).&#13;
Standardization with respect to duration of marriage Coes not&#13;
eliminate all the intercaste differences0 Huslims have the high2at&#13;
standardized average number of children (402), and Hairs have the lowest&#13;
(2.9).&#13;
5/ In general, when the term caste is used in this study, D t is intended&#13;
to refer to ethnicity based on both caste and zeligious affiliatlon.&#13;

Intercaste differentials in incomplete fertility are not always&#13;
consistent with the pattern of differentials of completed fertility. For&#13;
example, in marriages of 10-14 years, Syrian Christians and Latin Christians&#13;
have more or less the same average parity, but among older women (those&#13;
married 25 years or more) their average parities differ by 1.7 children. A&#13;
similar comparison holds between Nairs and the Scheduled Castes. Thus, the&#13;
fertility trend has not been the same for all castes at all times: the&#13;
differentials which existed in the past have undergone major change and new&#13;
differentials have arisen. For example, in 1965-70 the Christians had the&#13;
highest fertility rate, but the Muslims hold this position today (Annex Table&#13;
8).&#13;
Fertility differentials based on caste have narrowed somewhat in&#13;
recent years as the caste groups that originally had a higher fertility rate&#13;
have experienced larger fertility declines since 1965. All the caste groups&#13;
have felt the impact of birth control practices, either sterilization or&#13;
contraception, but some, such as the Ezawas, show a greater impact than&#13;
others, such as the Nairs.&#13;
Per Capita Household Expenditures&#13;
Per capita household spending has a very consistent and systematic&#13;
negative relation to fertility (Table 4.13). As monthly per capita household&#13;
spending increases from Rs. 30 or less to Rs. 120 or more, the average number&#13;
of children per woman decreases from 4.0 to 2.6. Among women married for at&#13;
least 25 years, the average number of children decreases from 6.7 to 4.5 with&#13;
increasing expenditures. Even with respect to incomplete fertility, the&#13;
inverse relationship holds rather systematically.&#13;

The inverse relationship between fertility and per capita household&#13;
expenditure seems to be quite robust, as is shown by both cohort and period&#13;
fertility measures (Annex Tables 9 and 10)o Marital fertility rates declined&#13;
systematically with per capita household expenditure for each age group and&#13;
for each five-year period from 1965 to 1980. (The only exception wez women&#13;
20-29 years in 1965-70.) Within the same expenditure group, fertility has&#13;
declined over timeo&#13;
As is the case with respect to other characteristics, the overall&#13;
decline has been largest in the intermediate group, that is lin households&#13;
that fall in the Rs. 60-120 range0 Fertility decline in this group has been&#13;
nearly twice that of adjoining groups. The extent of fertility decline has&#13;
been greater in the older age groups (above 30) then in the younger age&#13;
groups (below 30)o   Among women 30-44 in the per capita expend.ture group&#13;
Rs. 60-120, fertility declined by 67 percent during the ten-yesr period&#13;
1968-78o&#13;
Landownership&#13;
Ownership of land is another economic indicator with w^fhich&#13;
fertility in Kerala shows a fairly consistent relationship0 Table 4.14&#13;

In general, the less land a household has, the higher is the&#13;
average number of children per woman in the household; but the differences&#13;
are not large. The unstandardized average has a range of variation of 0.5&#13;
children, while the standardized average has a range of only 0.24 children.&#13;
Completed fertility also varies little from one landownership group to&#13;
another; the extremes differ by only 0.56 children. The pattern is somewhat&#13;
consistent, however. Households with 6-10 cents of land have the highest&#13;
fertility and those with 50-99 cents have the lowest. The highest fertility&#13;
is not observed in the lowest ownership class, nor the lowest fertility&#13;
in the highest ownership class.&#13;
Differentials and trends by ownership are presented in greater&#13;
detail in Annex Table 11. In 1965-70, the marital fertility rate declined&#13;
consistently with an increase in land owned by the household, from 6.74 to&#13;
6.12. This pattern did not hold in 1975-80, when the highest fertility was&#13;
observed in the highest ownership group and the lowest fertility was observed&#13;
in an intermediate group (11-49 cents).&#13;
Thus, fertility trends have not been uniform among the various&#13;
landownership groups. On the whole, however, there is an inverse relation&#13;
between land owned and percent decline in fertility. In the lowest group,&#13;
fertility declined by 31 percent from 1968-78, while in the highest group the&#13;
decline was only 22 percent.&#13;

Fertility Differentials by Faily Planning Status&#13;
Women using a conventional family planning method have a much&#13;
higher fertility than those who do not use any contraceptive0 The total&#13;
marital fertility rate for ages 20-44 (TMFRI) for practicing contreceptors&#13;
was 5.5 in 1975-80 compared with 4.9 for noncontraceptors. (Thic calculation&#13;
excludes sterilized women, who are not included in either group0) The&#13;
difference between the groups was 0.3 children per woman in 1965-70, thich&#13;
increased to 0.7 in 1970=75 and then decreased slightly to 0.6 in 1975=80&#13;
(Table 4.15)o&#13;
Rlgh fertility seems to have induced women to use famisly planning,&#13;
and this has led to a reduction in fertility. Some small narzowing of the&#13;
differentials in 1975-80 and a slightly higher rate of fertility decline&#13;
among family planning users for that period may be cited as evidence of the&#13;
impact of conventional family planning on the fertility trend. Since the&#13;
date of adoption of family planning by the women is not known, it is&#13;
difficult to give a more precise evaluation of the effect, but on the whole&#13;
it appears marginalo&#13;
As in the case of women who adopted a conventional fanily planning&#13;
method, sterilized women have higher fertility than nonsterilized women0 In&#13;
fact, it appears that women accept sterilization because they have tco many&#13;
childreno&#13;
In 1965-70 the TMFR' for sterilized women wae 7.5, compared to 5.9&#13;
for nonsterilized women (Table 4.16). The difference is 106 children per&#13;
womano  In 1975-80 sterilized women continued to have higher fertility (4.7&#13;
compared with 4.2 for the nonsterilized), but the difference between the two&#13;
groups had narrowed to 0o5 children per women0 In 1970=75 the differential&#13;
was even smaller (004)0   Thus, it appears that high fertility induced women&#13;
to accept sterilization and, as a consequence, the fertility differentials&#13;
between them and the nonaterilized women were reduced conciderably0&#13;
Although the TMFR' was higher among the sterilized in every&#13;
five-year period, their fertility rates at ages 30 and above ware not higher&#13;
in 1970=75 or in 1975-80. In each of these periodo, however, sterilized&#13;
wiomen have had higher fertility at ages below 30 years (Table 4.17). In&#13;
1965=70, even at older ages (above 30 years) sterilized women hzd higher&#13;
rates than nonsterilized women0    After 1970 the reverse was truze-sterilized&#13;
women had significantly lower fertility rates, by as much as Oo9 children in&#13;
1975-80. Thus, although sterilization had been selective of high fertility&#13;
women, it has, over time, resulted in a reduction of about one child per&#13;
woman. From 1965-70 to 1975=80, fertility decline among the steilized was&#13;
much higher (37.8 percent) than among either the nonsterilized (29.5 percent)&#13;
or the family planning practitioners (9.0 percent).&#13;

Factors Related to Fertility: Regression Analyses&#13;
In the previous sections of this chapter, differentials in&#13;
fertility levels and trends were estimated based on cumulative as well as&#13;
period-specific fertility rates. The analyses indicated which socioeconomic&#13;
groups had higher or lower fertility levels, as well as which groups&#13;
did or did not experience fertility declines, thereby yielding considerable&#13;
insight regarding the factors underlying fertility differentials and trends.&#13;
In this section, the same question is approached through multivariate&#13;
analysis.&#13;
Several measures of fertility have been used, beginning with&#13;
cumulative fertility or children ever-born (parity). We also reviewed two&#13;
period measures: the number of births per woman during five-year and ten-year&#13;
periods. Current fertility was determined by the number of births during the&#13;
last twelve months before the survey. The last measure used was the open&#13;
birth interval (period between births), which is inversely related to&#13;
fertility levels and directly related to the degree of fertility control.&#13;
Along with each of the nine dependent variables, ten independent&#13;
variables were used. Two are demographic control variables: age and age at&#13;
marriage. The third is a family planning variable (1 - sterilized or using a&#13;
conventional family planning method, 0 - otherwise). There is one cultural&#13;
variable, caste (1 = Nair or Syrian Christian, 0 - others) 6/ and one&#13;
socioeconomic variable, years of schooling (0,1,2,...) of the woman. The&#13;
five other variables are indicators of the family's economic condition.&#13;
These are:&#13;
-    per capita household expenditures&#13;
-    land owned by the household&#13;
-    roofing material (1 - tile, asbestos, tin, concrete;&#13;
0 - all other materials)&#13;
6/ Caste is also analyzed two at a time, with the Scheduled Castes as&#13;
the standard in all comparisons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
.-62 -&#13;
-    source of'water supply ( 1 = pipe; O - all. others):.&#13;
-    toilet facilities (1.=-flush; 2- ESP slab;- 3.,in.b4cket;&#13;
4 -, pit; 5- compound).&#13;
All ten independent variables had:a.-statistically s.gniticant&#13;
relationship with parity (regression I; see-Table 4.18).    The total-explained&#13;
variance (R) is 51 percent, of which 40 percent is due to age.     Of the&#13;
remaining 11 percent, 8 percent is contributed by age at marriage, 0.8&#13;
percent by years of schooling, 0.6 percent by caste, and 0.4 percent by&#13;
family planning.&#13;
Age at marriage had a negative relationship with parity; the&#13;
regression coefficient is -0.013. An increase of 'one year in.age at marriage&#13;
decreases the parity by 0.16. Years of schooling also had a negative&#13;
coefficient (-0.0753); an increase of five years in 'length of schooling&#13;
reduces the parity by 0.38.   Caste is negatively related.   Nairs and Syrian&#13;
Christians had significantly lower parity than all others taken together.&#13;
The economic variables, such as per capita household expenditures, land&#13;
owned, roofing material, and source of water supply, had positive&#13;
relationships.   Other things being equal, those who were "better off" had&#13;
more children than those who'were economically disadvantaged. Family&#13;
planning status also had a positive relationship. Those who were sterilized&#13;
or used conventional family planning had more children than others.&#13;
If we take the number of surviving children' as a measure of&#13;
fertility (regression II), the relationship does not change much. The R2&#13;
decreases from.51'to 45 percent,' of which 35 percent is due to the age&#13;
factor. All the factors remain statistically significant and keep the same&#13;
sign.&#13;
We next considered the number of children born in a specific period&#13;
of time (regressions III-VII). A few relationships appear consistently in&#13;
all these regressions.   One is that caste and education are negatively&#13;
related to fertility. Another is that age at marriage'is positively related&#13;
to period fertility but negatively related to cumulative fertility.'&#13;
Cumulative fertility was positively related to age,- as it should&#13;
be, but period fertility was' either negatively related or not significantly&#13;
related at all.   For births in a ten-year period., there was-a significant&#13;
negative relationship; for 'births in- a five-year period,- the negative&#13;
relationship was' statistically significant only .for the- period'-1975-80. For&#13;
the same period, age was significant at the second' degree level -in the&#13;
positive direction.&#13;
Age. at marriage was negatively related' 'to cumulat-ive fertility&#13;
measures, but- positively related- (very consistently in all 'five" `regressions)&#13;
to period fertility'. Women who married 'late had more children:born during a&#13;
fixed five-year or ten-year period.   For exampie, for the 1975-80 period the&#13;
regression coefficient is + 0.00173.   An increase of ten years in the age at&#13;
marriage was associated with an increase of 0.2'children born in that period,&#13;
a very small difference indeed for a very large difference. in age iat&#13;
marriage.&#13;

Years of schooling were negatively related in all Egcoosion, mend&#13;
in all but one they had a statistically significant associationo In generel,&#13;
the value of the regression coefficient declined with time, suggesting that&#13;
the degree of association between education and fertility grew weaker:&#13;

An increase of five years in schooling was associated with a&#13;
decrease of 0.25 children born during 1965-75, but of only 0.16 children born&#13;
during 1970-800 The corresponding changes from 1965-70 to 1975-80 were from&#13;
00167 to 0,069 children. Thus, education seemed to have lost some of its&#13;
power In determining a womanas fertility level.&#13;
Caste had an independent impact on fertility0 The regression&#13;
coefficient was negative and statistically cigni.lcant in every regression0&#13;

The type of toilet facility, on the other hand, did show some&#13;
significant relationship with fertility. Table 4.18 indicates that the&#13;
relationship was positive, but the facilities were inversely ranked: flush&#13;
had rank 1, ESP slab 2, bucket system 3, pit 4, and compound 5. Thus,&#13;
poorer facilities were associated with higher fertility. The relationship&#13;
was in reality negative.&#13;
The relationship of the family planning variable (1 = sterilized or&#13;
using a contraceptive, 0 = all others) to fertility was positive in some&#13;
regressions, but negative in others. We have mentioned that family planning&#13;
is positively related to cumulative fertility. Those who have large families&#13;
get sterilized or use contraceptives. The relationship is positive with&#13;
respect to period fertility for 1965-75 and for 1965-70. It becomes negative&#13;
for 1970-80 and for 1975-80, and nonsignificant (but positive) for 1970-75.&#13;
The coefficients are:&#13;
Regression&#13;

1975-80                 -0.1058&#13;
Adopters of family planning were a group selective of high&#13;
fertility. But once they adopted family planning, their fertility for&#13;
subsequent periods was significantly lower than that of nonadopters. Family&#13;
planning, especially sterilization, appears to have contributed to a&#13;
fertility decline in Kerala in recent years.&#13;
For the births in 1975-80, the ten independent variables together&#13;
explained at most about 29 percent of the total variance, with 26 percent&#13;
explained by age. Thus, the variance attributable to socioeconomic factors&#13;
was relatively small. The percentage of the total variance (29.2 percent)&#13;
explained by each is:&#13;
Age                   90.5&#13;
Family planning        2.2&#13;
Toilet facility        1.9&#13;

Two other regressions were included in our &amp;aly5sl.    Oae of th1em,&#13;
on births during the twelve months preceding the survey, indicated a&#13;
significant negative relationship with age, with education, and with family&#13;
planning. None of the socioeconomic variables other than education had&#13;
statistically significant relationchips0 The last regression uas on the open&#13;
birth interval, which was poaitively related to age and years of schooling&#13;
and negatively related to age at marriage and toilet facilities, These&#13;
regressions do not add much to the understandirg of the factorn underlying&#13;
fertility, except that they afford additional evidence of the z'elatively&#13;
insignificant part which socioeconomic variables play in explaining fertility&#13;
differences among women in Kerala.&#13;
The main conclusion that emerges from the summary of &amp;11 nine&#13;
regressions in Table 4018 is that, apart from demographic veriableo such as&#13;
age and age at marriage, the principal variables which had a statistically&#13;
significant impact on fertility were family planning, educational attainment,&#13;
and caste07/ The relation of fertility to family planning li&#13;
understandable, especially because a large proportion of the "family&#13;
planning" couples are actually sterllized (wife or husband)0 -The relation to&#13;
education is in the expected negative direction, and it remained&#13;
statistically significant even after controlling for age at Pmarriage and&#13;
family planning -- tw   variables through which education generally operates&#13;
on fertility0  The years of schooling of the woman had an inde:endent effect&#13;
on fertility. It is possible that better educated women used family planning&#13;
more eiflciently than less educated uomen, or that they had been practicing&#13;
family planning for longer periods of time0 An alternative explanation may&#13;
involve differences in the amount of time couples actually live together0&#13;
Educated women usually have educated husbands, who are likely to work away&#13;
from home for longer periods than less educated husbands0&#13;
The factors underlying the negative relationship between fertility&#13;
and caste are obscure0 The total variance accounted for by the regression&#13;
was less than 30 percent, leaving about 70 percent still to be explained0&#13;
Some of the factors involved are certainly cultural ones affectLing narriage,&#13;
abstinence, childbirth, cohabitation after childbirth, breast-feeding, and so&#13;
on, many of which are religion- and caste-related, It is no wander,&#13;
therefore, that fertility varies by caste and by religious group0 A detailed&#13;
explanation of the differentials would require en analysis of the practices&#13;
associated with marriage and child rearing specific to each grEup0&#13;
7/ Detailed analysis of the caste variable indicated that it uas only&#13;
the nair caste which had a significantly lower fertllity then 211he Scheduled&#13;
Castes, while only Muslims had a significantly higher fertility0&#13;

Chapter 5. Desire for Children&#13;
The reproductive period of a woman in a traditional society extends&#13;
typically from marriage to menopause, during which time a couple's fertility&#13;
plans and decisions are made. Two contrasting views are often posited&#13;
about the nature of these fertility decisions. The first, called the single&#13;
decision model, assumes that the demand for children is fixed at the start of&#13;
marriage; the later stages of reproductive life are relevant only with regard&#13;
to how well the initial decision is carried out. The second view, called the&#13;
sequential decisionmaking model, assumes that a rough decision about desired&#13;
family size is made early in a marriage, but that the desired family size is&#13;
recalculated periodically, with each achieved birth affecting the demand for&#13;
subsequent births. From the former perspective, fertility goals are&#13;
represented by the desired number of children, whereas from the latter&#13;
perspective, they are represented by the desire for an additional child.&#13;
This chapter is devoted to an analysis of each of these two measures of&#13;
fertility preference, and of the unmet demand for family planning that can be&#13;
derived from these measures.&#13;
The fertility survey used several attitude questions to generate&#13;
data pertaining to both desired number of children (also referred to here as&#13;
desired family size) and desire.for an additional.child. The responses to&#13;
these questions yielded the results summarized below.&#13;
On desired number of children:&#13;
-    The average desired number of children in Kerala was 3.25.    This is&#13;
slightly-less than the average parity.(3.48), slightly more than&#13;
the average number of surviving children (3.02), and less than the&#13;
estimated total fertility rate for 1975-79 (3.7).&#13;
-    The desired number of children was determined mostly by the number&#13;
of children ever-born, increasing by 0.44 with every unit increase&#13;
in parity.&#13;
-    32 percent of the women surveyed had more children ever-born than&#13;
they desired (excess fertility women), and 17 percent had more&#13;
surviving children than they desired (excess net fertility women).&#13;
-    Excess fertility women were more likely to be sterilized than&#13;
deficit fertility women. But not all excess (net or gross)&#13;
fertility women practiced contraception or were sterilized. About&#13;
46 percent of the excess fertility women and 40 percent of the par&#13;
fertility women (parity - desired number) were neither sterilized&#13;
nor using a family planning method. Similarly, 37 percent of the&#13;
excess net fertility women and 41 percent of the par net fertility&#13;
women were not taking any steps to prevent pregnancy.&#13;
-    The principal factors associated with the practice of birth control&#13;
by excess fertility women are family size and education (both&#13;
positively related).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 &#13;
On desire for an additional child:&#13;
27 percent of the currently mrzried w-omen reported ttat they did&#13;
not want an additional child. The principal determdnants of&#13;
wanting an additional child are age, number of survlving children,&#13;
number of surviving sons, and education (all negatively related),&#13;
age at marriage (positively related), and caste.&#13;
-    iWearly half of the nonsterilized wSomen who did not want an&#13;
additional child were not using any fom of contraception. The&#13;
principal determinants of contraceptive practice by such women wesre&#13;
education, age, and household economic status (all positively&#13;
related) and caste0&#13;
On unmet demand for family planning:&#13;
-    Unmet demand for family planning services was estiimted at 13 to ig&#13;
percent of the currently married women (13 if the definition is&#13;
based on desire for additional childzen, 18 if it is based on&#13;
desired number of children). For Kerala as a uhole. this implies&#13;
an unmet demand among between 500,000 and 650,000D WOenO&#13;
-    The incidence of unmet demand (using the conservative definition)&#13;
Was largest among the 35-39 age group (21 percent), women with five&#13;
or more surviving children (22 percent), iislims (22 percent), and&#13;
illiterates (24 percent)0&#13;
-    The principal reason why women with unmet demand were not using any&#13;
form of contraception was that either they or their htusbands&#13;
disapproved of family planning. It is necessary tc find out&#13;
whether this dislike is directed specifically againslt&#13;
sterilization, which was the principal method offerce in the&#13;
1970sD  Very probably, these couples can be rotivated to adopt&#13;
family planning if suitable alternate methods Eae offered.&#13;
Desired Number of ChildrTan&#13;
The analysis of the desired number of children, espacially in&#13;
conjunction with the actual number of chlUdren, provides a measure of the&#13;
prevalence of "undesired" children (or ancess fertility) in the society, a&#13;
measure of the prevalence of women with escecS fertiliLty (more children than&#13;
desired), and a measure of the vti.liation of birth control methods by women&#13;
who have completed their desired family osie0 This information, especially&#13;
coupled with the data on desire for another child, leads to eLditional&#13;
insights regarding the determinants of fertility and family pTanning usage in&#13;
KeralaO&#13;

Distribution&#13;
All ever-married women in the sample were asked:&#13;
"If you could choose exactly the number of children to&#13;
have in your whole life, how many children would that be?"&#13;
The distribution of ever-married women by their desired number of children is&#13;
given in Table 5.1. The desired number clusters around 2 and 3, with about&#13;
two-thirds of the women preferring either of these numbers. The mode is 3,&#13;
which is the desired number of 37 percent of the women; the mean is 3.25, and&#13;
the median is 2.47.&#13;
5.04      Some interdistrict variation in the distribution of the desired&#13;
number of children occurred. The proportion of women who prefer three&#13;
children is practically the same in all districts; however, the proportion&#13;
who prefer two varies considerably (36.5 percent in Ernakulam, but only 21.6&#13;
percent in Palghat).&#13;

Age.  As age and parity are highly correlated, the relationship&#13;
between desired family size and age is similar to that between desired family&#13;
size and parity. The average desired family size increases from 2.72 at ages&#13;
15-19 to 3.97 at ages 45-49 (Table 5.3). The increase is consistent from one&#13;
age group to another, and the interdistrict differentials are also consistent&#13;
at all ages. One peculiar feature of these data is that the desired family&#13;
size of women aged 20-24 is lower than that of their counterparts aged&#13;
15-19. This is similar to the "reverse pattern" observed in the data for&#13;
zero-parity women.&#13;

Other characteristics. Finally, Table 5.4 summarizes the variation&#13;
in the average desired number of children by age at marriage, family planning&#13;
practice, education, and ownership of land. Those women who marry late have&#13;
a lower desired family size than those who marry early. Those who use&#13;
conventional family planning methods have a lower desired number of children&#13;
than those who are sterilized (or have sterilized husbands) or do not use any&#13;
family planning method. Educated women desire fewer children than the less&#13;
educated or illiterate. While the ownership of increasing amounts of land&#13;
does not correlate with a marked difference in desired family size, there&#13;
does seem to be a general tendency for women with less land to desire more&#13;
children than do women with more land.&#13;

desired family are positively related. Second, there is no trend in the&#13;
average family size. The increase in desired number of children with an&#13;
increase in parity is a change which takes place after the birth of an&#13;
"undesired" child. When an additional birth takes place, whether desired or&#13;
not before conception, it becomes desired in 44 out of 100 cases. In actual&#13;
practice, both these processes may be operating: the desired family size has&#13;
been declining, and also the birth of an undesired child in nearly half the&#13;
cases changes the parents' expressed attitude about desired family size. The&#13;
policy implications of these two interpretations may be very different since,&#13;
according to the first, desired family size is determined more by socio-&#13;
economic variables, while according to the second it is determined by&#13;
parity.&#13;
The relation between the age of a woman and her desired family size&#13;
is similar to that between parity and desired family size, but the regression&#13;
coefficient is much smaller (R2 = 0.242).&#13;
Age at marriage is negatively related to desired family size; it&#13;
has a regression coefficient of -0.007, compared to 0.004 for age. Women who&#13;
marry later have a lower desired family size irrespective of their age,&#13;
parity, or education.&#13;
There is a strongly positive relation between desired family size&#13;
and the number of children dead (R2 = 0.133). For each death of a child,&#13;
the mother's desired family size rises by 0.133.&#13;
Finally, education has a negative relation to desired family size,&#13;
while landownership has a positive one. The regression coefficients are&#13;
relatively small, however (-0.029 and +0.0007 respectively).&#13;
Excess Fertility&#13;
In comparison to the distribution of the desired number of&#13;
children, the distribution of the actual number of children is much more&#13;
dispersive (Figure 5.1). The mode of the distribution of actual number&#13;
(parity) is also 2 or 3 (depending on district); but the percent of women&#13;
with two or three children is only 35, compared with 67 percent for those&#13;
desiring two or three children. The averages, however, are closer. The&#13;
arithmetic average of desired number of children is 3.25, and of parity&#13;
3.48. Thus, an ever-married woman in Kerala has, on average, 0.23 children&#13;
more than she desires. This average difference is, however, not a good&#13;
measure of the excess fertility in the State. For one thing, the sample of&#13;
women includes those ranging in age from 15 to 50, with marriages of widely&#13;
differing duration. The average is therefore a balance between the "excess&#13;
fertility" of older women and the "deficit fertility" of younger women rather&#13;
than any true measure of excess fertility. Second, the average parity&#13;
reflects not only present fertility rates, but also past fertility rates,&#13;
while the average desired number of children is a reflection of current&#13;
conditions. A better comparison would be between the average desired number&#13;
of children and the cumulative fertility rate based on current fertility&#13;
rates. Third, when asked about desired number of children, a woman's answer&#13;
is likely to reflect the desired number of surviving children (net fertility,&#13;

not gross fertility). Therefore, to estimate "excess fertility," the&#13;
comparison should be between desired family size and net fertility, that is,&#13;
the number of surviving children.&#13;
The actual number of children ever-born (P) to a woman is either&#13;
more, less, or equal to the desired number of children (D). On this basis&#13;
women can be classified into 3 groups:&#13;
-    excess fertility women, for whom P&gt;D&#13;
-    par fertility women, for whom P-D&#13;
-    deficit fertility women, for whom P&lt;D&#13;
The distribution of the sample of women by these categories is&#13;
shown in Table 5.5. Of the women surveyed, 866 or nearly one-third of the&#13;
total had more children born than they desired; they can be called excess&#13;
fertility women.&#13;

status.&#13;
As explained above, a more correct comparison regarding excess&#13;
children is that between desired number of children (D) and surviving number&#13;
of children (Ps). The difference (Ps-D) is called excess net fertility. As&#13;
Ps C' P, the number of women with excess net fertility is less than or equal&#13;
to the number of women with excess fertility, and the number of undesired&#13;
children alive is less than or equal to the number of undesired children&#13;
ever-born. These comparison are given in Tables 5.6 and 5.7. The number of&#13;
women with excess fertility is reduced by about 400 or nearly half, while the&#13;
number of undesired children is reduced by 49 percent. However, the average&#13;
number of undesired children per woman remains fairly constant. Those women&#13;
who have excess fertility or excess net fertility each have about 2.2&#13;
undesired children.&#13;

The incidence of excess fertility is fairly uniform in the three&#13;
districts (Table 5.5), but it varies considerably by age, parity, and&#13;
socioeconomic characteristics.&#13;
Parity. We have seen that the number of children a woman has is a&#13;
major determinant of the number of children she desires. It is also a major&#13;
determinant of her fertility status (excess, par, or deficit). Figure 5.2&#13;
shows the distribution of women by fertility status at each parity (gross)&#13;
for the three districts combined.&#13;
There are practically no excess fertility women among those who&#13;
have two children or less. The proportion of excess fertility women&#13;
increases very sharply at parity 3: between parities 3 and 4, it jumps 34&#13;
percent. The increase decelerates sharply at higher parities. Three-parity&#13;
women are the best target for family planning education in the sense that&#13;
they are likely to yield the maximum results by their acceptance of family&#13;
planning methods.&#13;
Socioeconomic characteristics. A strong negative relationship&#13;
exists between education and excess fertility. The proportion of excess&#13;
fertility women decreases from 46 percent among women with no education to 15&#13;
percent among women with ten or more years of schooling (Table 5.8).&#13;
The relationship between ownership of land and excess fertility is&#13;
also negative, but rather weak. Among women with little land, about 35&#13;
percent are excess fertility women. The proportion decreases only slightly&#13;
(to 29 percent) when the ownership of land increases to one acre or more&#13;
(Table 5.8).&#13;
The 866 excess fertility women in the sample survey have among them&#13;
1,929 undesired children, or an average of about 2.23 undesired children each&#13;
(Table 5.7). There are 81 women who each had five or more undesired&#13;
children. The 1,929 undesired children represent a fifth (20.8 percent) of&#13;
all the children ever-born to these women. Their distribution by the parity&#13;
of the mother is shown in Table 5.9. The proportion of undesired children&#13;
increases very sharply with partiy, from about 6 percent at parity 3 to about&#13;
42 percent at parity 8+.&#13;

women.  It may well be that educated women report their actual desired family&#13;
size while illiterates tend to rationalize the number already born and thus&#13;
minimize the extent of undesired children.&#13;
Ownership of land and per capita household expenditures are&#13;
negatively related to excess fertility.l/   As the amount of land owned by&#13;
the household increases, and as per capita household expenditures increase,&#13;
the incidence of excess fertility decreases.&#13;
Excess Fertility and Family Planning Use&#13;
One of the major interests in studying the data on desired and&#13;
actual number of children is the relationship between fertility status and&#13;
family planning use. Do excess fertility women turn to family planning? How&#13;
does their practice compare with that of other women? The relevant&#13;
statistics are shown in Table 5.10.&#13;
Excess fertility women practice family planning or are sterilized&#13;
more often than deficit fertility women (54 percent compared with 22&#13;
percent), but less often than par fertility women (60 percent). The&#13;
difference is mainly with respect to sterilization, however, and not&#13;
conventional family planning. The percentage of women who use conventional&#13;
family planning methods does not vary significantly by fertility status (17,&#13;
20, and 18 percent, respectively, for the excess, par, and deficit fertility&#13;
groups). It is instructive to note that even among the deficit fertility&#13;
group, 18 percent use contraceptives, which must be to control spacing of&#13;
births. About 37 percent of the excess fertility women and 40 percent of the&#13;
par fertility women were sterilized, while the corresponding figure among the&#13;
deficit fertility women was only 4 percent.&#13;
The pattern of family planning use does not change substantially if&#13;
excess fertility is defined in terms of surviving children instead of&#13;
children ever-born. A small but noteworthy difference, however, is that the&#13;
percentage of users among excess net fertility women is higher than among par&#13;
net fertility women. This is not the case with excess and par gross&#13;
fertility women.&#13;
The three districts show some significant variation in family&#13;
planning practice among excess fertility women. In Palghat, 71 percent of&#13;
such women have not taken any steps to prevent additional pregnancies.&#13;
Although the proportion of nonusers is smaller in the other two districts, it&#13;
is still above 30 percent in both. Family planning programs have not served&#13;
all the women who might have need of them -- particularly among those who&#13;
report having more children than they desire. There is room for considerable&#13;
increase in family planning practice and sterilization in these districts.&#13;

Education. About 37 percent of illiterate excess fertility women&#13;
were sterilized or were using a conventional family planning method, compared&#13;
with 76 percent of those with ten years of schooling. Even among the deficit&#13;
fertility women, the pr4etice of birth control was greater among the&#13;
educated. The comparisons in Table 5.11 highlight the part which education&#13;
may play in the increased adoption of birth control methods.&#13;

Landownership. Ownership of land is not a significant factor&#13;
influencing the use of contraceptives, especially among excess fertility&#13;
women. The percentage ox women who practice family planning is more or less&#13;
the same at all levels ot landownership.&#13;
Family Planning Use by Excess Fertility Women: Regression Analyses&#13;
Not all women with excess fertility (or more children than desired)&#13;
adopt family planning methods. What are the factors that lead to family&#13;
planning usage by some excess fertility women and not others? To answer this&#13;
question, six regressions were undertaken, three for women with excess or par&#13;
gross fertility and three for women with excess or par net fertility.&#13;
Regarding the use of conventional contraceptives, only two factors&#13;
have statistically significant relationships to either net or gross excess&#13;
and par fertility: education and landownership.2/ Family planning is&#13;

related pocitively to education (linearly) and naegetively to cwmership of&#13;
land. Thus, highly educated women from households with smaLL landholdings&#13;
are the most likely to adopt family planning, while tillitete z!nrmen from&#13;
households with large landholdings are the lasst likely to do co. The&#13;
variance explained in the case of nst fertilAty is 1404 percent, of which&#13;
13.6 percent is contributed by educstion and 05 percent by landownership0&#13;
Whether one uses children ever-born or children surviving does not change hea&#13;
conclusions0   Other things being equal, one additional year of schooling&#13;
increases by 5 percent the proportion of excess or per fartility uonmen using&#13;
conventional family planning.&#13;
The propensity to get steeilized is affected by several variables&#13;
in addition to education, but the total veriance explained by them is nEh&#13;
smaller (R2 - 0.05 for gross or net parity). The economic vartibles are&#13;
negatively and significantly related to steTilizetion, which decreases sa a&#13;
household's land or per capita expenditure increaseso Poorer women with&#13;
excess fertility thus have a greater chance of being sterilizei than richer&#13;
women with the same education and the same number of children0 Tee principal&#13;
variable, however, is not education but parity, which has a significant&#13;
relationship at the first degree as well as at the second degree0    The&#13;
turning point is parity 3.6. At parities 4 and above, the higher the paEity,&#13;
the less the chance of getting sterilized0 The relationship vith education&#13;
is also curvilinear0   In this case, the turning point is 6.7 yerEs of&#13;
schooling; over 7 years, the longe   the sechooling the less is the chance of&#13;
getting sterilized0&#13;
If conventional family planning and steli2ation are combined, ths&#13;
overall picture does not change substantially (R2 - ItO fo or gross or net&#13;
parity)0 Education emerges as the principal factor, with a positive&#13;
relationship at lower levels of education and c negetive    elationCship at very&#13;
high levelso Perity is second in importance, Dith a positive relationship et&#13;
loWer parities and a negative relationship at paritile above 3. The negative&#13;
relationship with ownership of land peritos , but that with per capita&#13;
houcehold expenditure becomes Cstattically insignificant0&#13;
Finally, caste is not a factor in thet adoptLion of b(irth control&#13;
methods by excesa fertility women0   This is sn iuportant finding bheaus it&#13;

Those who answered "yes" were asked further,&#13;
"Do you want to have a child sometime?"&#13;

this question. 3/&#13;
Differentials&#13;
Of these 1,229 women, 598 (49 percent) did not want any additional&#13;
children, 53 (4 percent) were not quite sure, and 578 (47 percent) wanted to&#13;
have at least one more child. Combining those undecided and those not&#13;
wanting an additional child, about 53 percent of the women did not express a&#13;
desire for more children. The 47 percent who want at least one more child&#13;
are over ten years younger than their counterparts who do not want another&#13;
child, and they have, on average, fewer surviving children. Both they and&#13;
their husbands have more education than the women who want no more children,&#13;
accounting in part for a later age at marriage and a smaller desired family&#13;
size. There are no differences in household expenditures among those who&#13;
want an additional child and those who do not. The former, however, own&#13;
slightly more land than the latter.&#13;

percent) followed by the Nairs (44 percent), whereas the majority of the&#13;
women belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes do want another child&#13;
(57oO percent). There is only a slight difference between the Ezawas and the&#13;
Muslims; nearly 500 percent of both groups want another child0&#13;
Desire for Another Child: Regression Analysis&#13;
Desire for an additional child (yes or no) was made the dependent&#13;
variable in a multivariate analysis. All variables available from the survey&#13;
which have some theoretical relation to the dependent variable were included&#13;
in the regression as inde?endent variables0   In carrying out the analysis, a&#13;
two-stage approach was employed.&#13;
First, since age and age at marriage are covariates of parlty, the&#13;
variance attributed to these twyo variables was separated0   Of thDe 55.5&#13;
percent variance explained by the model, 48 percent, or 86 percent of the&#13;
total variance in desire for another birth, is explained by thece two&#13;
demographic variables (Table 5.13). Age, which has the highest explanatory&#13;
power (44 percent, or 79 percent of the total), but a relatively small&#13;
regression coefficient, is negatively associated with desire for an&#13;
additional birth0 This inverse relation stems from the fact that older women&#13;
are more likely to have had the opportunity to attain their desired family&#13;
size and hence are less likely to w^sant another birth0 A similar explanation&#13;
can be offered for the positive associatlon between age at marriage and&#13;
wish for additional births; women who married at older ages have had less&#13;
opportunity to achieve their desired family size and hence show a greater&#13;
proclivity toward wanting an additional child.&#13;
Of the remaining variables which showed a significant relation to&#13;
the desire for another birth, the number of surviving children, not&#13;
surprisingly, added the most in explaining the variance (it also had the&#13;
highest regression coefficient): women with more surviving children were&#13;
less likely to want an additional child0 Likewise, son survivorship, which&#13;
also had a high regression coefficient, wias negatively associated with desire&#13;
for an additional child0 Muslim women were more likely than w5oen of other&#13;
groups to want an additional child0 Finally, the level of education of the&#13;
respondent had a negative association with desire for another child, although&#13;
the regression coefficient was relatively small0&#13;

Fertility Preference and Family Planning Use&#13;
Of the women who did not want another child, 51 percent were&#13;
practicing contraception by means of conventional family planning methods&#13;
(Table 5.14), compared to 28 percent of the women who wanted another child.&#13;
Table 5.15 presents bivariate relationships between socioeconomic and&#13;
demographic variables on the one hand, and use of contraception among women&#13;
who both did and did not want another child on the other hand. Except for&#13;
the number of surviving children, the characteristics of women who used&#13;
contraception were similar, irrespective of whether they wanted another child&#13;
or not. They tended to be older, they married at an older age, both they and&#13;
their husbands had more schooling, and they desired smaller families than&#13;
those not using any method of contraception. Among contraceptive users who&#13;
wanted no more children, however, completed family size exceeded desired&#13;
family size; this was not the case for contraceptive users who wanted another&#13;
child.&#13;

Family Planning Use by Fertility Preference: Regression Analyses&#13;
Again a multivariate analysis was used, this time to study the&#13;
factors affecting contraceptive use among women with different fertility&#13;
preferences regarding another child. The independent variables are the same&#13;
as those listed in Table 5.13. The dependent variable is current use of&#13;
contraception.&#13;
The regression results confirm the findings of the bivariate&#13;
analysis: preference for another child is not relevant to the decision to&#13;
use contraception. Among both sets of respondents, those who wanted another&#13;
child and those who did not, education and caste'were important predictors of&#13;
contraceptive use (Tables 5.16 and 5.17). As the level of education&#13;
increased, women were more likely to practice contratception, irrespective of&#13;
fertility preference. In addition, Christians were most likely to use a&#13;
method of contraception, whether for spacing or for terminating fertility.&#13;
The other variables that had a significant relation with&#13;
contraceptive use for women who did not want another child were age,&#13;
household expenditures, and land. The first two had a positive association&#13;
with the dependent variable'. Landownership, contrary to the relationship&#13;
suggested by the bivariate statistics, had a negative association:   as the&#13;
size of the landholding increased, the tendency to use contraception&#13;
decreased. The regression coefficient, however, was very small (-0.0002).&#13;
For women who did want another child, as the number of surviving children&#13;
increased, so did the likelihood of practicing contraception.&#13;

In summary, the multivariate analysis suggests that fetillity&#13;
preference is not relevant to the decision to practice contreceptlon.&#13;
Educated women and Christians, both those that did and those that did not&#13;
want more children, were likely to use a method of contraception. The only&#13;
relevant demographic variable among women who wanted no more chlldren was&#13;
ageo This is not surprising since older women are more likely to have&#13;
completed their family formationo&#13;
Unmet Demand for Family Planning&#13;
The data discussed so far in this chapter seem to indicate that not&#13;
all women who should have been using a contraceptive ware doing so, w hatever&#13;
the reason; undoubtedly there is an unmet demand for family planning services&#13;
in Kerala. What is the extent of thls unmet demand, and among wfh ich women&#13;
does it exist?&#13;
A woman can be said to have an unmet demand for family p.lanning if&#13;
(a) she is currently married, living with her husband, and not using a&#13;
contraceptive; (b) neither she nor her husband is sterilized; an,-, (c) she&#13;
does not want any more children. A slightly different definition can be&#13;
developed on the basis of desired family sizeo According to this, a woman&#13;
has an unmet demand for family planning if she satisfies (a) and (b) above&#13;
and if, in addition, the number of children she desires is less than or equal&#13;
to the number of her surviving children0&#13;
The survey questions on desired number of children and on desire for&#13;
additional children were sometimes answered rather casually by respondents;&#13;
as a result, estimates of unmet demand based on these questions rsy not be&#13;
reliableo Therefore, a third definition is based simply on the nu-ber of&#13;
surviving children0   A woman has an unmet demand for family planning services&#13;
if she satisfies (a) and (b) above and if, in addition, she has three or more&#13;
surviving children0 The extent of umet demand in the three survey districts&#13;
combined, according to each of these three definitions, is given in Table&#13;
5.180 It varies from 12 to 23 percent according to the definition uced0 If&#13;
the same ratio is applied to the whole of Nerala, then the number of women&#13;
with an unmet demand for family planning in the State is between half a&#13;
million and one milliono   In 1981 about half a iEAllion married wcmen in the&#13;
fertile ages in Kerala did not want an additional child, but wars not using&#13;
contraception to prevent pregnancyo About 650,000 women desired a number of&#13;
children less than or equal to the number of living children they already&#13;
had, but were not using contraception0 Finally, about 850,000 u'zen had&#13;
three living children and wEre not uslng contraception0&#13;
The entent of unmet demand is not the c&amp;m2 in all disatricts but is&#13;
highest in Palghat (Table 5018)o The Palghat ratios indicate Vtht unmet&#13;
demand is more prevalent in the northern disericts of ezzrala than in the&#13;
south0&#13;

Women with an unmet demand for family planning services were not&#13;
unique; although their characteristics were somewhat different from those of&#13;
all married women surveyed, the differences were not very great (Table&#13;
5.19). The largest number of women with an unmet demand fell in the 30-39&#13;
age group, among those with three surviving children who were illiterate and&#13;
belonged to the Ezawa community. The highest rate of unmet demand was also&#13;
among the same groups, except for the Ezawa community. The rate of unmet&#13;
demand was higher among the Muslims (22 percent) than among the Ezawas (16&#13;
percent).&#13;

The principal reason for not using contraception cited by women&#13;
with an unmet demand for family planning was disapproval of the family&#13;
planning program (true for more than half the women; see Table 5.20). This&#13;
disapproval, given the situation in Kerala, may well indicate dissatisfaction&#13;
with sterilization as a contraceptive method. If nonterminal methods of&#13;
fertility control were made available to these women, perhaps acceptance&#13;
would be greater. In a few cases women lacked knowledge about the program,&#13;
but on the whole the problem appears program-related, requiring demand&#13;
creation and not simply the provision of more information about the services&#13;
offered. It is therefore necessary to enquire further into the reasons why&#13;
many women and their husbands disapprove of family planning even though they&#13;
do not want any more children.&#13;

Chapter 60 Marriage as a Factor in the Fertility Trend&#13;
The mean age at marriage of females in Kerala has been quite high&#13;
(21.3 years in 1961-71 compared to 1607 for India as a whole)0 The present&#13;
study analyzed the age at marriage of ever-married women, which being a&#13;
truncated sample gave a biased estimate (dowunwird  of the actua-? average age&#13;
at marriage of all women in Kerala, and came to the following conclusionsg&#13;
-    The average age at marriage of women increased from N 2 yearsc for&#13;
those married in 1950-54 to 20.7 yeares for those married in&#13;
1975-79o&#13;
-    The average age at marriage was higher for educated women (21.8&#13;
years among those with ten or more yeares of sechooling) than for&#13;
illiterate women (17o5 yearsl; highez for Letin Chrisetans (20.1),&#13;
Syrian Christians (19.8)D and Heirs (19o6) than for KLslims (17.0)&#13;
and Scheduled Castes (18.2) D and higher for women in households&#13;
better off economically than for women in households Less uell off.&#13;
Miost socioeconomic variables (education, eote, and co on) have an&#13;
independent effect on age at marriage even when the effects of all&#13;
other variables are controlled.&#13;
-    About 30 percent of the fertility decline in Kerala between 1965-70&#13;
and 1975-80 can be traced to an Increase in the age at marriage and&#13;
a consequent decrease in the proportion of women wmrried0 The&#13;
effect of age at marriage on the fertility decline has been&#13;
increaSing during the period 1965-80.&#13;
Harital Status DiMtribueion&#13;
According to the Ourvey 1,646 out of a toteal of 4,315 women aged&#13;
15-49 were never married; 2,669 weres married Or had been Emarried; 2,371 were&#13;
currently married; and the remsinder were iidowedD divorced, Deperated9 or of&#13;
unknown marital status. These figures imply that in 1900 over one-third (38&#13;
percent) of all women of reproductive age in nErala were never 2mrried and&#13;
therefore had no chance for reproduction0 This reprzeents a drastic increase&#13;
in the proportion of women not expooed to pregnancy, from 28 peent in 197i&#13;
to 38 percent in 1980 (Table 601)o&#13;

Among the ever-married women, some were not currently married and&#13;
therefore were also not exposed to pregnancy. The proportion of women&#13;
currently married (among all women) was 55 percent in 1980 compared with 64&#13;
percent in 1971. A crude estimate of the fertility reduction due to these&#13;
changes in marital status distribution between 1971 and 1980 is about 14&#13;
percent.&#13;
If the never-married women are excluded from the figures, then the&#13;
proportion of women currently married has declined very marginally, the&#13;
proportion widowed has declined significantly, and the proportion divorced or&#13;
separated has increased (Table 6.2). The net effect of these changes on&#13;
fertility is, on the whole, very small. The pronatal effect of a decrease in&#13;
widowhood is offset by the antinatal effect of an increase in divorce and&#13;
separation.&#13;

Not only has the average age at marriage in Kerala been high, it&#13;
has been increasing in recent years. The age at which 50 percent of the&#13;
total number of women are married (median age), calculated on the basis of&#13;
the proportion single, is shown in Table 6.4 for the three survey districts.&#13;
The results confirm both the high average age at marriage and the steady&#13;
increase in age at marriage over time. Alleppey has the highest median age&#13;
at marriage and Palghat the lowest. The pattern was the same in 1961 as in&#13;
1980.&#13;

More detailed information on trends in the average age at marriage&#13;
is given in Table 6.5. All the marriages (2,680) were classified according&#13;
to date of occurrence, and the mean age of the women at the time of marriage&#13;
was calculated for each five-year period. Each recent period shows a higher&#13;
age at marriage than the previous one in all three districts. Palghat&#13;
consistently has the lowest mean age and Alleppey the highest. The&#13;
difference between these two districts narrowed between 1937 and 1964 but has&#13;
widened since then.&#13;

Factors Related to Age at Marriage: Regression Analyses&#13;
Seven regressions were run to identify the factors related to age&#13;
at marriage (see Table 6.9). Most of the independent variables turned out to&#13;
have statistically significant relationships.&#13;
A simple classification of marriages as "early" (at ages 20 or&#13;
younger) or "late" (older than age 20) revealed that late marriage is&#13;
significantly and positively associated with caste, education, and year of&#13;
marriage (R2 = 0.09). Year of marriage is the largest contributor to the&#13;
explained variance (66 percent), followed by caste (22 percent) and education&#13;
(12 percent). Substantially higher proportions of Nair and Christian women&#13;
married late. Similarly, educated women and women who married more recently&#13;
had higher proportions in the late marriage group.&#13;
Two other regressions (II and III) used the actual age at marriage&#13;
as the dependent variable. The year of marriage (Ym), one of five&#13;
independent variables, appears in both first and second degree form in one of&#13;
the regressions. Of the total variance explained by this regression (25&#13;
percent), 69 percent is contributed by Ym and an additional 4 percent by&#13;
(ym)2. Both these contributions are statistically very significant. The&#13;
change in age at marriage was not the same in all years, but was larger in&#13;
earlier years. Between 1960 and 1961, the average age at marriage is&#13;
estimated to have increased by 1.94 months; between 1980 and 1981, the&#13;
estimated increase was only 0.45 months.&#13;
Caste, education, and household expenditures are significantly --&#13;
and positively -- related to age at marriage, while landownership is not.&#13;
After age at marriage, caste contributed the largest proportion of the&#13;
explained variance (18 percent), followed by education (6 percent) and&#13;
household expenditures (4 percent). The regression coefficient for education&#13;
is 1.074; that is, for each one-year increase in schooling, the average age&#13;
at marriage increases by 1.07 months. The increase is much smaller than the&#13;
four-month difference observed in a one-way comparison between age at&#13;
marriage and educational attainment.&#13;

In regressions IV and V the analysis was confined to women over&#13;
25. This changes neither the earlier direction of the relationship nor the&#13;
statistical significance of the variables. Caste, year of marriage,&#13;
education, and household expenditures remain the principal factors affecting&#13;
age at marriage of women; all are positively correlated. The total explained&#13;
variance increases to 35 percent (from 25 percent for all women), but year of&#13;
marriage remains the major factor, accounting for 83 percent of the explained&#13;
variance, followed by caste (12 percent), household expenditures (3 percent),&#13;
and education (2 percent). Amount of land owned is irrelevant once the other&#13;
factors are taken into consideration.&#13;
Regression VI confined the analysis to women who married before the&#13;
age of 25 (RI=0.384). All the variables except land are significantly&#13;
correlated to age at marriage, with year of marriage again accounting for&#13;
most of the explained variance (Ym = 51 percent; [ym]2 = 37 percent). The&#13;
effect of calendar year is positive until 1970 and negative afterwards.&#13;
Education has a coefficient of 0.85 (an 8.5-month increase for ten more years&#13;
of schooling), which is lower than the coefficient when all marriages are&#13;
considered.&#13;
The final regression used marriages which took place in the 1970s&#13;
as the sample population. The total variance explained was only 10 percent,&#13;
highlighting factors not included in the regression. The coefficient of&#13;
education is higher (a 13.7-month increase for ten more years of schooling),&#13;
but the coefficient for per capita household expenditures became&#13;
insignificant. In terms of the variance explained by each variable, caste is&#13;
the principal factor (44 percent), followed by per capita household&#13;
expenditures (21 percent).&#13;
In summary, the multivariate analysis indicated that age at&#13;
marriage is statistically affected by caste, year of marriage, and number of&#13;
years of schooling, but not by ownership of land. Per capita household&#13;
expenditures are statistically significant in all but one regression (VII),&#13;
in which only recent marriages are included. The inclusion of all these&#13;
variables explains a maximum of 38 percent of the total variance in age at&#13;
marriage. This is a fairly good specification, except that 20 percent of the&#13;
38 percent is explained by the time trend and not directly by the&#13;
socioeconomic variables.&#13;
The Marriage Factor and the Fertility Decline&#13;
The date of marriage of each married woman was obtained in the&#13;
survey along with her date of birth. From these data, it was possible to&#13;
reconstruct the proportion of women married at any given time. This&#13;
information is displayed in Table 6.10.&#13;

A similar analysis for 1970-75 and 1975-80 gives the following&#13;
results:&#13;
TFR  1970-75                    4.59&#13;
TFR  1975-80                    3.69&#13;
Difference (decline)           0.90&#13;
Due to marriage factor&#13;
(4.59-4.23)                  0.36 (40 percent)&#13;
Due to fertility decline&#13;
(4.23-3.69)                  0.54 (60 percent)&#13;
Finally, for the 1965-70 to 1975-80 period, the overall decomposition is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
TFR  1965-70                      5.91&#13;
TFR  1975-80                      3.69&#13;
Difference (decline)              2.22&#13;
Due to marriage factor&#13;
(5.91-5.23)                    0.68 (31 percent)&#13;
Due to fertility decline&#13;
(5.23-3.69)                     1.54 (69 percent)&#13;
Thus, the marriage factor played a significant role in the fertility decline&#13;
during 1965-80. Roughly 31 percent of the fertility decline during this&#13;
period was due to the decline in the proportion of women married, with the&#13;
balance or 69 percent due to fertility decline within marriage. The effect&#13;
of the marriage factor was greater in the ten-year period 1970-80 than in&#13;
1965-75.&#13;
Figure 6.1, based on a more detailed analysis by age (see Annex&#13;
Table 13), indicates that the effect of marital status on fertility was by&#13;
far the greatest for younger ages, principally the 20-24 age group (52&#13;
percent of the total decline) and the 15-19 age group (22 percent of the&#13;
total decline). At the same time, there is no age group where there was any&#13;
increase in fertility due to the marriage factor.&#13;

Chapter 7. Family Planning as a Factor in the Fertility Trend&#13;
Kerala is reported to be one of the most successful States of India&#13;
with respect to family planning practice. As of 1980 about 806,000&#13;
vasectomies and 675,000 tubectomies had been performed. The number of IUD&#13;
insertions was almost 400,000, and 154,000 people were using conventional&#13;
contraceptives. In 1980 about 30 percent of the currently married women were&#13;
effectively protected from pregnancy through the services of the official&#13;
family planning program. Acceptance of family planning is estimated to have&#13;
caused a reduction of about 10 points in the crude birth rate by 1980, which&#13;
agrees fairly well with the Government of India's Sample Registration System&#13;
(SRS) data on birth rates.&#13;
The sample survey gave the following results concerning&#13;
contraceptive knowledge and practice:&#13;
-    Almost all ever-married women in Kerala knew of at least one birth&#13;
control method. Lack of general knowledge about the family&#13;
planning program is not a major problem in the State any more.&#13;
-    About 52 percent of the currently married women in the three&#13;
districts were sterilized themselves, had a sterilized husband, or&#13;
were using a conventional family planning method. Contraceptive&#13;
usage was greater than the level reported by the official&#13;
statistics.&#13;
On sterilization:&#13;
-    Some 28 percent of the ever-married women and 31 percent of the&#13;
currently married women were sterilized, or had a husband who was&#13;
sterilized.&#13;
-    The proportion of sterilization was highest in the age group 30-34&#13;
years (46.2 percent of all currently married women), among&#13;
three-parity women (49 percent), and among Christians and Ezawas.&#13;
-    The propensity to be sterilized is curvilinearly related to&#13;
socioeconomic status, with the highest propensity occurring at an&#13;
intermediate level - for example, among those with 1-4 years of&#13;
schooling, or living in households with mid-range monthly&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
-    Overall, there is a negative association between sterilization and&#13;
the economic level of the household in which the woman lives.&#13;
On conventional contraceptive use:&#13;
-    About 19 percent of ever-married women and 31 percent of currently&#13;
married, nonsterilized women were using some conventional family&#13;
planning method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 &#13;
- ot all the conventional contraceptive users were effectively&#13;
protected against pregnancy; less than half (43 percent) were using&#13;
relatively reliable methods such as XUDs, pills, or condoms; others&#13;
were practicing abstinence, safe period methods, withdrawal, and so&#13;
ono&#13;
Use of a conventional contraceptive was positlvely related to&#13;
socioeconomic status. it was highest among women with ten or more&#13;
years of education; highest among Syrian-Christians; highest among&#13;
women in upper-income households, in the upper landownership group,&#13;
and so on.&#13;
On all family planning methods:&#13;
-    The principal determinants of contraceptive use (sterilizatlon or&#13;
conventional methods) were excess fertility, education of the&#13;
woman, and age. Education has a negative effect on sterilization&#13;
at higher levels of schooling.&#13;
-    Socioeconomic and demographic variables explain only a small&#13;
portion (less than 20 percent) of the total variation in ktnowledge&#13;
and practice of family planning and in acceptance of&#13;
sterilization0 Factors related to the family planning program&#13;
itself--such as incentives, official blessing, and an efficient&#13;
organization--are likely to have played a more important role than&#13;
socioeconomic factors in determining whether a particular couple&#13;
adopted family planningo&#13;
=    Sterilization alone could explain much of the fertility decline net&#13;
accounted for by increase in age at narriage0   The impact of&#13;
conventional contraceptives on fertility is very small0&#13;
Knowledge of Family Planning Methods&#13;
All ever-inarried women were asked the questiong&#13;
"As you know, there are various methods a couple&#13;
could resort to with a view to delay the next&#13;
pregnancy or to avoid pregnancyo   Do you ktnowy of, or&#13;
have you heard of, any of these ways or msthodV?"&#13;
After the reepondents' answgers to this question were recorded, the methods&#13;
not mentioned were described to them one by one, and each woman was asked&#13;
wdhether she knew or had heard of any of them, and whether she had ever used&#13;
any of them0&#13;
The responses received indicate that married women in KeralsL are&#13;
aware of birth control methods, both conventional ones and sterili%ation0    Of&#13;
the 2,694 women to whom the above question was prct, 2,383 or 88 percent&#13;
answered spontaneously that they knew about sooe birth control ?rethod, w hile&#13;
only 311 or 12 percent said they did noto   The level of knowledge wao&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -&#13;
greatest in Alleppey (95 percent) and least in Palghat (80 percent), with&#13;
Ernakulam falling in between. Knowledge of birth control methods among&#13;
Kerala women is higher than in Pakistan (75 percent) or Indonesia (77&#13;
percent) but lower than in some other countries of Southeast Asia, such as&#13;
the Republic of Korea (97 percent) and Malaysia (92 percent), according to a&#13;
rough comparison made by the World Fertility Survey (Vaessen 1980, Table 1).&#13;
Various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are related&#13;
to a woman's contraceptive knowledge (Table 7.1). Among the ever-married wo-&#13;
men surveyed, knowledge about family planning was highest among those 30-34&#13;
years old (92 percent) and lowest among those 15-19, about one-fifth of whom&#13;
had not heard of any family planning method. The variation by parity is an&#13;
inverted J-shaped curve, with the highest degree of knowledge at parity 3.&#13;
The relation to age at marriage is somewhat linear, with knowledge increasing&#13;
along with age at marriage.&#13;
Years of schooling have a very significant and positive impact.&#13;
While about 25 percent of the women with no education had never heard of any&#13;
family planning method, all but 2 percent of the women with ten years or more&#13;
of schooling knew of at least one method. Each increase in the number of&#13;
years in school is accompanied by an increase in the percentage of women with&#13;
knowledge about family planning methods. Landownership, on the other hand,&#13;
makes little difference.&#13;

that the usage of conventional family planning methods by these women is&#13;
equivalent to about 30 sterilizations (compared to 746 women or husbands&#13;
actually sterilized). Conventional family planning practice, in other words,&#13;
added little to the fertility decline in the State.&#13;
The usage rate of conventional family planning methods is very low&#13;
in Palghat District; only about 7 percent of the ever-married women there&#13;
practiced some form of conventional contraception, compared to 26 percent in&#13;
Alleppey District (Table 7.2). At younger ages, women in Ernakulam are more&#13;
prone to use conventional family planning methods than women in Alleppey, but&#13;
at older ages the reverse situation prevails. This is partly due to the&#13;
different rates of sterilization in these two districts. If the usage rate&#13;
of conventional contraceptive methods is calculated for nonsterilized women,&#13;
then the two districts are very close: 38 percent in Alleppey and 37 percent&#13;
in Ernakulam. The differentials by age remain unaffected, however. The&#13;
usage rate is significantly higher in Ernakulam than in Alleppey at younger&#13;
ages, and lower at older ages.&#13;

Age. Conventional family planning practioners are fairly uniformly&#13;
distributed by age. The proportion of ever-users and current users remains&#13;
fairly constant at about 35 percent for ever-users and about half that for&#13;
current users. Some variation is noticed when the sterilized women are&#13;
removed from the denominator, as in Table 7.3: family planning practice then&#13;
increases with age up to 35 years, after which it decreases. This is the&#13;
result of two conflicting trends. The practice of family planning is greater&#13;
among the better educated, and younger women have more education than older&#13;
ones. On the other hand, family planning practice increases with age as the&#13;
desire for protection against pregnancy becomes stronger and as knowledge of&#13;
family planning methods accumulates. Given these opposing trends, the&#13;
incidence of family planning practice is greatest among those in the middle&#13;
age groups.&#13;

Socioeconomic characteristics. With age at marriage the&#13;
relationship is fairly linear (Annex Table 14): women who marry late tend to&#13;
adopt conventional family planning methods more often than women who marry&#13;
early. Similarly, women who have more schooling practice family planning in&#13;
greater numbers than women who are illiterate. The increase in the&#13;
proportion of women currently practicing family planning with an increase in&#13;
years of schooling is very sharp, from 6.3 percent for those with no&#13;
schooling to 40.3 percent for those with ten or more years (Table 7.5). The&#13;
relation to per capita household expenditures is also sharply linear, with an&#13;
increase from 7 percent to 33 percent between the lowest expenditure class&#13;
and the highest (Table 7.6).&#13;

In this section we define a woman as sterilized if either she or&#13;
her husband is sterilized. The total number of women surveyed who were&#13;
sterilized (or whose husbands were sterilized) was 750, or 28 percent of all&#13;
the ever-married women and 31 percent of the currently married women. Thus,&#13;
nearly a third of the exposed women in Kerala were sterilized (Table 7.9).&#13;
As in the case of conventional family planning use, the three districts&#13;
varied considerably, and similarly, with respect to the prevalence of&#13;
sterilization. In Ernakulam 37 percent of ever-married women were&#13;
sterilized, but in Palghat only 15 percent were. In the younger age groups&#13;
Alleppey had a higher proportion of sterilized women, but at ages above 25&#13;
years the proportion in Ernakulam was significantly higher.&#13;

Age. The greatest number of sterilized women in the three survey&#13;
districts, 48 percent of the total, were in the 30-39 age group. The average&#13;
age of a sterilized woman was 34.4 years. Age has an important bearing on&#13;
the propensity to accept sterilization. At 15-19 years, very few women were&#13;
sterilized (Table 7.10). The proportion increases considerably with the&#13;
wife's age up to 30-34 years, in which age group about 42 percent of all&#13;
ever-married women were sterilized (56 percent in Ernakulam District). At&#13;
older ages the proportion of sterilized women decreases, partly due to the&#13;
fact that the proportion of currently married women decreases, but also&#13;
because the propensity to be sterilized among older currently married women&#13;
also decreases.&#13;

Education. Unlike the sharp positive relationship between&#13;
educational attainment and conventional family planning practice, the&#13;
relationship between education and sterilization is curvilinear, with the&#13;
highest proportion of sterilized women among those with 1-4 years of&#13;
schooling. In this group, about 34 percent of the ever-married women and 39&#13;
percent of the currently married women were sterilized. Part of the reason&#13;
why women with more years of schooling were not more likely to be sterilized&#13;
was that they were using other fertility control methods (Table 7.12). But&#13;
this alone is not an adequate explanation; a better understanding of the&#13;
relationship was obtained through the regression analysis summarized below.&#13;

Other characteristics. Finally, we studied the variations in the&#13;
proportion of sterilized couples by per capita household expenditures and&#13;
ownership of land. With household expenditures, the relationship is&#13;
curvilinear; women in households with a per capita monthly expenditure of&#13;
Rs. 50-59, which is in the middle range, are the most likely to be sterilized&#13;
(33 percent). Very little variation by size of landholdings occurs (see&#13;
Annex Tables 15 and 16).&#13;
Family Planning Methods Combined&#13;
Conventional family planning methods and sterilization are&#13;
alternate means of controlling fertility. If a woman is sterilized there is&#13;
no need for her to use conventional family planning methods; if she uses&#13;
conventional family planning methods efficiently, there is no need to resort&#13;
to sterilization. Both types of practice, therefore, must be considered&#13;
simultaneously.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116 &#13;
About 46.8 percent of all sveT-Kried wmen Surveyce were eithEr&#13;
sterilized or used a conventional family plaznning rethod. In general, the&#13;
relationship between various socioeconomic factors and both conventional&#13;
family planning practice and steriligation is similer. 1or e2=ple, the&#13;
greatest degree of fertility regulation, by whatever means, is seen et sges&#13;
30=34 years (Annex Table 17) and anong women with thres children (Annex&#13;
Table 18)o There are differences, however, when the variable is education&#13;
(Table 7.12); with conventional family planning methods the reletieon is&#13;
positive throughout, but with sterilization it is curvilinear0 W^hen both&#13;
methods are combined, the relationship remains positive0 i easaly 60 percent&#13;
of women with at least ten years of schooling have adopted some form of birth&#13;
control, compared with 53 percent of those with 5-9 years of schooling, 49&#13;
percent of those with 1-4 years of schooling, and 28 percent of those iTth no&#13;
schooling.&#13;
With respect to age at marriage (Annex Table L4), the positive&#13;
relationship with conventional methods and the negative relationship with&#13;
sterilization cancel one another, leaving a flat curve for the two groups&#13;
combined0 Ownership of land is not a relevant factor (Annex Thble L6)D but&#13;
per capita household expenditure (Annex Table R5) iso So is ceste (Annex&#13;
Table 19). Scheduled Castes and Ezawas h,ave a comparatively low rate of use&#13;
of conventional family planning techniques (20-30 percent ever-used), but&#13;
this is compensated by their high sterilization rate (about 30 percent)0&#13;
Christians have high rates for both types of birth control (53-55 percent&#13;
have at some time used conventional contreceptives; 27-33 percent are&#13;
sterilized), while Muslime have low rates (about 20 percent for both&#13;
conventional methods and sterilization)0&#13;
In general, the proportion of women practicing bizth control who&#13;
use conventional methods increases with rising socioeconomic statuso    Use of&#13;
such methods is more prevalent among women who are better educated, belong to&#13;
the higher castes, and live in households with more land and greater per&#13;
capita monthly expenditures0&#13;

Knowledge of Family Planning  iethodo&#13;
The wife's education is the principal variable affecting the&#13;
knowledge of family planning methods (regresasion I). The total variance&#13;
explained by all the independent variables together is 8oO percent, 39&#13;
percent of which is attributable to the wife's yarEs of schoolimzg and 11&#13;
percent to the square of her years of sechooling0 The regressioon coefficients&#13;
are +00275 and 0O00145 respectively. At lower levels of the woman's&#13;
education, an additional year of schooling Increases the knowledge of family&#13;
planning methods by 2.75 percent. At higher levels, however, the improvement&#13;
is marginal.&#13;
Age is statistically related to knowledge of family pl.anning&#13;
methods, both linearly and at the second degreeo   At younger ages and lower&#13;
parities, there is a positive relationship between knowledge of family&#13;
planning methods and age. At older ages the relationship is negetive; thet&#13;
is, family planning knowledge decresees with age0&#13;
As explained earlier, the direct relation at younger eges and&#13;
inverse relation at older ages are due to two conflicting tnendso Family&#13;
planning is relatively new to Kerala, and younger women with a bettee&#13;
education are more likely to know about its methods than older women with&#13;
less education0 At the same time, younger women have less need to acquire&#13;
knowledge about family planning0 The need is greater among older women, who&#13;
have also been exposed over a longer period to family planning publicity.&#13;
These conflicting trends together result in sgaimum knowledge rbeing ?ossessed&#13;
by women about 37 years of ageo&#13;
Caste has a significant effect on knowledge about family planningo&#13;
Relative to the Scheduled Castes, Dhich are the refeTence group, the   tairE&#13;
and Ezawae are better informed,, while the Christiens and ruslims do not show&#13;
any significant difference0   Finally, ownership of land by the hrousehold is&#13;
not a relevant factor in this regard0&#13;
EvervUse of Conventional 14ethods&#13;
A large number of variables havse a  tatistically Siguificant&#13;
relationship with the everEuse of any of the conventional famiLy plganing&#13;
methods (regression II). The most important are the wife e6ducation, age,&#13;
land owned, and caste0&#13;
As with knowledge of family planning methods, so their use&#13;
increases with longer schoolingo   Education accounts for 46 percent of the&#13;
total variance explained by all the variables0 With thes othe vEriables&#13;
remaining constant, the level of contrae2ptive use in KTerla at, vaiouc&#13;
levels of educational ettainment wiould be as shoun in Figure 7.lo&#13;
Surprisingly, ownership of land hao a negative relation to the uos&#13;
of conventional family planning methods0 Additional veaiables w. hich Tgmake a&#13;

Ever-Use of Pills, IUD, or Condoms by Nonsterilized Women&#13;
Only two variables have a significant relationship wt-.h the use of&#13;
efficient conventional family planning methods, including pills, IUD, or&#13;
condoms (regression IV). These are the wife's education and age0 For years&#13;
of schooling the association is linear and poseitive0 For age it is positive&#13;
at younger ages, but negative at older ageso&#13;
Sterilization&#13;
Most of the variables except caste and per capita expenditures have&#13;
a statistically significant relationship with the propensity to get&#13;
sterilized (regression V)O Age has a positive relationship only at younger&#13;
ages. Sterilization increases with age up to 38 years, after which it starts&#13;
decreasingo Similarly, education of the wife is positively relEted to&#13;
sterilization at lower levels (about six years of schooling), but beyond that&#13;
level, the more educated a woman, the less her chance of being sterilized&#13;
(see Figure 701)o Education of the husband is also positively related to&#13;
sterilization status up to about six yeares of schooling only. 'Lsnd owned is&#13;
associated negatively with sterilization0&#13;
Use of Conventional Family Planning ijethods or Sterilization&#13;
Two regressions were run- one included excess fertijLity ES an&#13;
independent variable (dummy), the other did not. When excess fertility is&#13;
not considered, all variables except the husbandls education and per capita&#13;
household expenditures are statistically esignificent in expleining&#13;
contraceptive use (regression VI)o Education accounts for 24 iercent of the&#13;
total explained variance, age for 61 percent0   When excess fertility status&#13;
is included in the regression, it assmes major importance in contrlbuting to&#13;
the explained variance (R2 - 18 percent, 35 percent of which is due to the&#13;
excess fertility variable)o Education contrLbutes 34 percent of the&#13;
explained variance, and age 25 percent (regreosion VII)0&#13;
The overall conclusion is that, other than age and fertility&#13;
status, the wife's education is the most important single factor in&#13;
determining both knowledge and uee of family planning methods0 Of the total&#13;
variance explained by the independent variables, education contributed 49&#13;
percent to Inowledge of family planning -ethods, 45 percent to ever-use of&#13;
conventional family planning mathods, 45 percent to use of conventional&#13;
methods by nonsterilizdd women, but only 12 percent to steriligationo In the&#13;
latter case, the second degree negative relationohip is more prominent thsa&#13;
the first degree positive relationship (H05 percent versus 0002 pereent)0&#13;
The overall level of R2 is low, varying from 8 to 18 percent0 Thuo, there&#13;
are quite a number of other factors which determine whether a women uses a&#13;
contraceptive or whether she or her husband is sterilized0    These zay not ba&#13;
socioeconomic factors at all, but rether programrelated factors0&#13;

Reasons for Not Using a Contraceptive&#13;
A direct question about the reason why women were not using a&#13;
contraceptive revealed that there were still some couples in Kerala who&#13;
disapproved of family planning methods. This was the case for 8.4 percent of&#13;
the women surveyed and 18.4 percent of their husbands (Table 7.14). Only 3.3&#13;
percent of the women, however, gave lack of knowledge about the availability&#13;
of family planning services as a reason for not practicing family planning.&#13;
Thus, the major obstacle to increased use of contraceptives in Kerala seems&#13;
to be a lack of demand rather than a lack of knowledge about methods or&#13;
facilities.&#13;

Family Planning Use and the Fertility Decline&#13;
With about half the currently married women either sterilized or&#13;
using a conventional family planning method, family planning should have a&#13;
significant impact on fertility in Kerala. What is the actual contribution&#13;
made by family planning to Kerala's fertility reduction?&#13;
The distribution of women by family planning and marital status is&#13;
given below:&#13;
Total women, 15-49 years             1,000&#13;
Never married                          379&#13;
Widowed, divorced                       69&#13;

Exposed to pregnancy                   254&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122 &#13;
All but 25o4 percent of the women surveyed were protected from&#13;
pregnancy, if those who used conventional family planning methode used them&#13;
efficiently. This does not necessarily mean, however, that all !ut 25.4&#13;
percent of births were averted, as fertility rates are not the SaeE at all&#13;
ages0 The relative contribution of the various factors to birth control is&#13;
shown in Figure 7.2. The age-by-age analysis does not change the conclusion&#13;
substantially; the proportion of births averted ie more oE less equal to the&#13;
proportion of wlomen protectedo  Summary results are reproduced below:&#13;

assuming realistic efficiency       0.07    0.7    3M51    37&#13;
If family planning were 100 percent efficient, then the total&#13;
fertility rate in Kerala in 1980 would have been about 2.44. But the actual&#13;
rate was highero Conventional family planning haz not been tetally effective&#13;
in controlling births, although it may have been somewhat usefuL in&#13;
postponing themo&#13;
Earlier we estimated that the effect of there being 502&#13;
conventional family planning practitioners was equivalent to that of 30&#13;
sterilizations0 If this is correct, then conventional family pLanning&#13;
practice should have resulted in a reduction of 0C04 (30/746) telms the&#13;
reduction due to sterilization, or 0.07, in the total fertility rate0 This&#13;
would mean an estimated total fertility rate of 3M51 for 1980O&#13;
Thus, Kerala's potential fertility rate was reduced by 63 percent,&#13;
of which 45 percent was due to celibacy, delayed marriages (at ages above 15&#13;
years), widowhood, and so on, and 18 percent to sterilization and&#13;
conventional family planning methods0   While most of ths effect of&#13;
sterilization and family planning took ?lace during 1970=80, 9uch of the&#13;
effect of the nuptiality factor took place earliero The increase in age at&#13;
marriage, however, continues to be an important factor in Tierala's fertility&#13;
decline.&#13;

Part Three. InterpTetations and Conclusions&#13;
This study of the resoons for the Tecent steep ra,tility decline in&#13;
Kerala assumes that decisions about f&amp;Aily buildMig - uhether, The, and&#13;
ughom to marry; uhether, when, and how many children to prEodc  °- are&#13;
strongly influenced by the perceived economic a6ventages End disasvantages&#13;
involved0 KeraJLas fertility has declined, according to this hypothesio, in&#13;
large part because children have becoire increasingly costly, uhile the&#13;
benefits from them have not kept pace with the higher cotSo    The grdual&#13;
rice in the cost of bringing up children is the Esozlt, in turn, of&#13;
improvements in health and education h- ealth, because the numbez of&#13;
children surviving to be raised and educated has increseod; education,&#13;
because the level of education necessary for economic survival ame&#13;
consequently the actual years of schooling have incressed sherply Among all&#13;
segments of the populationo&#13;
The low level of infant and child morta.ity and the hi3    le el of&#13;
educational aspirations and attainmento hIave ccmbined to provide an&#13;
environment in Kerala conducive to a &amp;dcline in fertiit-y0   Sut, -the Sgound&#13;

as a criterion for admittance to public service, brought stbout a basic chaengs&#13;

Chapter 8. Determinants of Age at Marriage&#13;
Nearly all healthy women in Kerala are either married or intend to&#13;
get married. But the age at which these women marry is relatively high&#13;
compared to other States of India. This phenomenon is not new; it has been&#13;
shaped by a variety of cultural and historical forces, and has persisted for&#13;
many years. Our concern here, however, is not to explore the traditional&#13;
reasons for the disparities between Kerala and India in this respect.   It is&#13;
rather to measure the recent increase in age at marriage in Kerala, and to&#13;
determine which are the principal socioeconomic factors that explain why&#13;
women are not marrying as early as they used to. These factors, as has been&#13;
noted, are not very different from those underlying an increase in family&#13;
planning practice, to be discussed in Chapter 9. There are, nonetheless,&#13;
important differences in timing; socioeconomic factors affected age at&#13;
marriage first, even before they had any perceptible impact on marital&#13;
fertility.&#13;
Conceptual Framework&#13;
Among most communities in Kerala, marriages are arranged and&#13;
represent economic and social contracts between two families rather than&#13;
personal agreements between a boy and a girl. In these contracts, the social&#13;
status and lifetime income of the boy and girl (and their families), but&#13;
particularly of the boy, have been and still are very important&#13;
considerations. Before, it was relatively easy to estimate status and income&#13;
and thus contract a marriage even when the boy and girl were very young, as&#13;
these attributes depended on ascribed position and inherited wealth,&#13;
especially land. Land is no longer the principal source of status and&#13;
income, however; today these are acquired through one's education and&#13;
career. Thus, the economic value of young people can be realistically&#13;
assessed only after they have completed their studies and found a job. So&#13;
marriages are often delayed until then. In a period when both the length of&#13;
schooling and the time lag between finishing school and securing a job are&#13;
increasing, the age at marriage is likely to continue to rise.&#13;
Not all boys and girls are still in school at 15 or 16; many have&#13;
already completed their formal education by that age. While a slight&#13;
increase in the number of years that young people are in school does not&#13;
directly affect their age at marriage, it can do so indirectly through&#13;
changes in attitude toward marriage. Moreover, how people will earn a living&#13;
after leaving school is often not clear until they reach the age of 20 or&#13;
more. Finally, apart from these factors, there have been other economic&#13;
reasons for delaying marriage in recent years.&#13;
One such reason involves the dowry system common in most groups in&#13;
Kerala. The amount of dowry, in cash and kind, has increased considerably in&#13;
relation to household assets, reflecting the increasing cost of educating a&#13;
son and assuring his employment. In the past much of the dowry came from&#13;
inherited wealth; today the sum usually comes from savings and/or&#13;
borrowings. As a result, marriages must be delayed until the girl's parents&#13;
can amass sufficient funds or creditworthiness to satisfy the bridegroom's&#13;
family. For a boy, his chance of recieving a good dowry is much brighter&#13;
when his economic worth is fully manifest, that is, when he completes his&#13;
education and acquires a suitable job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
Young couples' views on housing arrangements after marriage are&#13;
also changing.   Newlyweds used to live with either set of parents, but many,&#13;
especially among the! educated, now prefer some other arrangement. Moreover,&#13;
as more young people work at a distance from their parents' home, separate&#13;
housing becomes a necessity. *Whether out of choice or necessity, housing can&#13;
become an important consideration in deciding when to marry. In urban areas,&#13;
housing problems are caused by shortages and by rents that are beyond the&#13;
means of the lower and middle classes. In rural areas, they are caused by&#13;
shortages of land and by changes brought about byAland reform. Formerly,&#13;
landless persons were able to build a hut on a wealthy neighbor's land&#13;
without much difficulty. This arrangement was mutually beneficial; the&#13;
landowner got a watchman to look after his land and crops, while the landless&#13;
person got a place to stay rent-free.   This alternative is now less readily&#13;
available because land is scarce, while the land reform laws make it&#13;
difficult for the wealthy neighbor to get back his land when he needs it.&#13;
Among both rich and poor, then, problems related to housing tend to delay&#13;
marriage.&#13;
Marriage decisions are often made by the parents, particularly the&#13;
fathers. This is changing, but as the present survey has shown, most of the&#13;
decisions are still made by the parents. It may be economically advantageous&#13;
for a father to delay his son's marriage, since by doing so he retains the&#13;
use of his son's wages for family expenses and saves himself the difficult&#13;
problem of finding housing for the newlyweds. Before, when children were not&#13;
in school, they could contribute to family income at a young age. Now they&#13;
do so only at an older age after they have finished their education.&#13;
Marriage decisions, then, are made mostly on the basis of perceived&#13;
economic advantage and disadvantage, not only to the couple, but also to the&#13;
parents. In the past, assessments could be made relatively easily when the&#13;
boy and girl were still quite young. But as the economic basis for marriage&#13;
decisions has shifted from land and other inherited resources to education&#13;
and other acquired assets, the average age at marriage has edged upward.&#13;
A schematic representation of the relationship between age at&#13;
marriage and the socioeconomic variables enumerated above - education,&#13;
employment, dowry, and housing - is given in Figure 8.2. These variables&#13;
affect the components that enter into the timing of when people marry,&#13;
including not only the number of years in school, but also the lags between&#13;
schooling and first job, between first job and the decision to marry, and&#13;
between that decision and the completion of the marriage negotiations. As&#13;
any or all of these time spans increase, so of course does the age at&#13;
marriage.&#13;
Empirical Evidence&#13;
In order to determine the validity of this conceptual framework&#13;
regarding age at marriage, the various possible explanatory factors have been&#13;
tested for relevance using data collected as part of the fertility survey.&#13;
The remainder of this chapter will analyze to what extent the available&#13;
evidence supports each of the following hypotheses:&#13;

-    Marriage decisions are most often made by parents.&#13;
-    Economic considerations play a major part in marriage decisions&#13;
(partly as a consequence of the parents' role).&#13;
-    The recent increase in age at marriage of girls is mostly due to&#13;
the lengthier education needed to equip young people for economic&#13;
survival; the longer time lag between finishing school and starting&#13;
to work caused by unemployment problems; the larger dowry demanded&#13;
by the groom's family; and the growing housing problem.&#13;
Who Makes Decisions about Marriage&#13;
All ever-married women were asked whether their marriage decisions&#13;
were made by themselves, by their parents, jointly, or by others such as&#13;
uncles or brothers.  Their answers indicate the overwhelming role played by&#13;
parents in this matter (Table 8.1). Marriage proposals are initiated by&#13;
parents and acted upon by-them. During this process parents consult their&#13;
daughter (or son) and often take the young person's views into consideration,&#13;
but the final decision is theirs.&#13;

The proportion of marriages decided upon m'ainly by parents (about&#13;
90 percent) remained fairly constant by year of marriage, indicating little&#13;
change over time. Among educated women, however, more and more marriages are&#13;
planned by couples and parents jointly (Table 8.2).&#13;

Reasons for Marrying Late&#13;
All never-married women were asked whether they intended to marry;&#13;
if they did they were then asked what was their intended age at marriage and&#13;
why they did not intend to marry earlier. Nearly all women (699 out of 736&#13;
or 95 percent) answered that they would marry sometime in the future. Of the&#13;
few who said they would not, most were handicapped (21 out of 37). The&#13;
reason women gave for not having yet married or for not intending to marry&#13;
before a certain age are summarized in Table 8.3.&#13;
These answers were elicited on the basis of an open question.&#13;
Undoubtedly most never-married women delayed their marriage for economic&#13;
reasons. Either they were unable to get a marriage offer from an&#13;
economically secure boy, or they did not want to jeopardize their own&#13;
educational and employment opportunities by marrying too early. Noneconomic&#13;
reasons (such as waiting for a sister to get married) were cited&#13;
occasionally, but in most cases they too could be traced to some economic&#13;
motivation.&#13;

Thus, the first and second hypotheses of our conceptual framework&#13;
are well founded--parents make most of the decisions about the marriages of&#13;
their children, and the basic factors underlying these decisions are economic&#13;
in nature. We shall now consider in some detail the various economic factors&#13;
believed to influence marriage decisions.&#13;
Education. Whether, when, and whom to marry are all undoubtedly&#13;
affected by a woman's level of education. Educated women marry later than&#13;
illiterate women (a difference of 7.2 years among those who married before&#13;
1960, and of 2.7 years among those who married in 1975-79; see Chapter 6).&#13;
Education is a principal determinant of age at marriage even when other&#13;
socioeconomic factors are taken into consideration. Additional data on&#13;
"best" age at marriage as reported by both married and unmarried women, and&#13;
on intended age at marriage among the unmarried, are given in Table 8.4.&#13;

Intended age at marriage of&#13;

Best age for girls to get married&#13;
as stated by never-married women       0.3281          61.3     14.4&#13;
All the regression coefficients are highly significant and&#13;
positive. The education variable accounts for a large proportion of the&#13;
variation in the desired, or best, age at marriage (39 percent of the&#13;
explained variance in the case of married women, and 54 percent in the case&#13;
of unmarried women). Educated married women have a'much older desired age at&#13;
marriage, and they marry at an older age. Similarly, educated unmarried&#13;
women have a much older desired age at marriage, and they intend to marry at&#13;
an older age. This confirms the fact that education is a major, perhaps even&#13;
the most important, determinant of age at marriage. The effect persists not&#13;
only through a longer period of school attendance, but also through later&#13;
changes in occupation, affecting attitudes toward a marriage partner, toward&#13;
age at marriage, and so on.&#13;
Employment. Data to test the relevance of employment as a&#13;
determinant of marriage were generated by two questions. The first pertained&#13;
to the employment status of husbands at the time of marriage.   The second,&#13;
addressed to both married and unmarried women, asked whether they would agree&#13;
to marry a boy without a job if he was acceptable in all other respects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
Most women (95 percent) were married to men who were employed or had&#13;
other means to support a wife at the time of marriage. The regression&#13;
between age at marriage and the dummy variable "employed or unemployed"&#13;
(along with education and other socioeconomic variables) gave a statistically&#13;
insignificant coefficient. Women who married men without a job did not have&#13;
an average age at marriage different from that of women who married men with&#13;
a job.&#13;
Married women whose husbands had a job or other means of support at&#13;
the time of marriage were asked further whether they or their parents would&#13;
have agreed to the marriage if the boy did not have a job. A similar&#13;
question was asked of never-married women. The negative answers given by&#13;
these two groups (88 percent and 78 percent respectively) show that the women&#13;
were overwhelmingly against marrying an unemployed person (Table 8.5).&#13;
The regression for married women between age at marriage and attitude toward&#13;
marrying an unemployed male was statistically significant; that for unmarried&#13;
women between intended age at marriage and attitude toward marrying an&#13;
unemployed male was not.&#13;

The age at marriage of married women who said they would not marry an&#13;
unemployed boy was significantly lower (by five months) than that of women&#13;
who said they would not mind marrying such a boy. It is possible that a&#13;
woman's age at marriage has influenced her answer to this question instead of&#13;
her attitude about marrying an unemployed male affecting her age at marriage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 &#13;
Among unmarried women, on the other hand, there is no signifizsnt&#13;
association between intended age at iarriage and opinion about Fr7ry:ig an&#13;
unemployed boyo The proportion of tomen who would have married oomsone&#13;
unemployed is higher among the unmarried than among the maEtried '.22 percent&#13;
versus 12 percent). The fact that more women xwho married late than early,&#13;
and more women who were unmarried than married, would have accepted a spouce&#13;
without a job, indicates that strict conditions for selection of a carriege&#13;
partner are progressively relaxed as marriage is delayed further and further&#13;
beyond the desired (best) age.&#13;
Dowryo The dowry system continues unabated in Kerala, despite the&#13;
fact that the practice was made illegal in 19610 Many marriages are delayed&#13;
or cancelled because of dowry problems0&#13;
For the married women surveyed, the average dowry was about RsD&#13;
6,900o It was higher for the currently married than for the widowed; higher&#13;
for the younger women than for the older ones; and higher for the educated&#13;
than for the illiterate, as shown in Table 8.6.&#13;

Never-married uomen were asked how much dowry they wusild bz&#13;
expected to pay if they were to marzy the boy of their choice0 The average&#13;
expected dowry was almost twice the average dowry of those married (Rso&#13;
12,200 compared with Rso 6,900). Only a small part of this difference is due&#13;
to variations in the age distribution (the standardized average for married&#13;
women, using the age distribution of the never-married as the standard&#13;
population, was RsB 7,100).&#13;
The average age at marriage is higher among those who have given&#13;
larger dowries, but the regression between age at marriage and 'hrides wzealth&#13;
is not statistically significant (Table 8.7). The association betwueen best&#13;
age to marry and dowry is, however, significant and positivez the less the&#13;
dowry, the lower the age deemed beset for grlKs to get marzied0 One reason&#13;
for the nonsignificant relationship between dowry and age at mnrriage may be&#13;
the way the dowry variable is defined. The regression used the amount of&#13;
dowry actually given by the married, and the amount expected to be given by&#13;
the unmarried0 The potential of insufficient funds or goods was not-&#13;
measured; yet it is the unavailability of dowry which would hamper the&#13;
fulfillment of a marriage.&#13;

Fortunately, a further question used in the survey captures this&#13;
aspect of the dowry problem. Married women were asked if their marriage was&#13;
delayed because the needed dowry could not be raised. About 7 percent&#13;
answered in the affirmative; they would have been married earlier if their&#13;
parents could have given the dowry asked for by the prospective bridegroom.&#13;
The problem was greatest among women of average education (Table 8.8).&#13;

The never-married women were asked a slightly different question:&#13;
would their marriage be delayed or cancelled if their parents could not raise&#13;
the necessary bride's wealth. About half the women (48 percent) said the&#13;
marriage would be delayed, and the rest said it would be cancelled&#13;
altogether. This gives some indication of the importance of dowry in&#13;
postponing marriage. It is quite possible that a large proportion of the&#13;
never-married women in the sample were not married because their parents&#13;
could not come up with the needed dowry. While this direct question was not&#13;
asked, the answers to the hypothetical question indicate that many of the&#13;
older unmarried women had remained unmarried because of the dowry problem&#13;
(about 40 percent).&#13;

Actual and Desired Age at Marriage&#13;
Finally, the women were asked about the best age for girls in a&#13;
family like theirs to marry. If these "best ages" prove higher than the&#13;
actual age at marriage for recent years, then our contention that economic&#13;
problems have caused an increase in age at marriage rests on flimsy ground,&#13;
at least for the majority of women. On the other hand, if women are marrying&#13;
later than they think is best, then this argument gains greater credence.&#13;
The available data are presented below.&#13;
Average age at marriage&#13;
-    all women married in 1970-74                     19.7&#13;
-    all women married in 1975-80                     20.7&#13;
-    all women aged 25-29 years                       19.6&#13;
Average best age at marriage for girls&#13;
-    as stated by all married women                   19.4&#13;
-    as stated by married women aged 20-24 years      19.1&#13;
-    as stated by married women aged 25-29 years      19.6&#13;
Average intended age at marriage for girls&#13;
-    as stated by never-married women                 22.6&#13;
Average best age at marriage for girls&#13;
-    as stated by never-married women                 20.3&#13;
For married women the best age to get married is only slightly less than the&#13;
actual age at marriage; the difference has little significance. For&#13;
never-married women, however, the intended age at marriage is very much&#13;
higher than the best age. The delay in marriage in this group is apparent.&#13;
These averages tend to hide a good deal of useful information.&#13;
Table 8.11, based on a bivariate distribution, shows that 42 percent of the&#13;
married women married at an age higher than their desired age. Similarly,&#13;
nearly 45 percent of the never-married women intend to marry at an age higher&#13;
than their desired age.&#13;

Chapter 9. Determinants of Fertility Decline&#13;
Conceptual Framework&#13;
In the preceding chapter we have underscored the major part played&#13;
by economic considerations in decisions about whether, when, and whom to&#13;
marry. The general hypothesis followed in this research suggests that&#13;
economic considerations are equally powerful determinants of whether, when,&#13;
and how many children to produce. Just as the increase in age at marriage&#13;
observed in recent years in Kerala is due to the perceived disadvantages of&#13;
the past practice of marrying early, so the decrease in marital fertility is&#13;
due to the perceived disadvantages of raising a large family -- given the&#13;
changed economic and social situation in the State.&#13;
As a general hypothesis, few can find fault with this framework.&#13;
The difficulty comes in trying to specify what economic advantages or&#13;
disadvantages are associated with what socioeconomic changes and for which&#13;
segments of the population.&#13;
Ratcliffe, writing in 1978 on social justice and the demographic&#13;
transition in Kerala, concluded:&#13;
As education and income levels rose as a consequence of&#13;
distributive policies, fertility and mortality declined in&#13;
response. As viable investment opportunities other than&#13;
children and occupational opportunities other than child-&#13;
bearing became available, fertility declined in response.&#13;
As the political economy was transformed from one founded&#13;
on exploitation of the many by the few to one which began&#13;
increasingly to assume welfare functions traditionally ful-&#13;
filled by children, fertility declined--and continues to&#13;
decline--in response. (p. 140)&#13;
According to Ratcliffe, the major cause of fertility decline in the&#13;
State was the improvement in the level of living of Kerala's poor. In other&#13;
words, fertility and income are negatively related; as the income of the&#13;
majority of the poor increased, their fertility decreased. Furthermore,&#13;
since the poor constitute a large proportion of Kerala's population, any&#13;
decrease of fertility among them was reflected in the State's average rate.&#13;
Ratcliffe gives much credit to the political situation, to the social and&#13;
economic reforms brought about by the successive governments, and to the&#13;
social justice which resulted from these reforms. He does not give any&#13;
special credit to the family planning program, seeming to imply (although he&#13;
does not say so explicitly) that much of the fertility decline would have&#13;
taken place even without the official program.&#13;
In a recent article on "The Lessons and Non-Lessons of Kerala."&#13;
Mencher (1980) expresses a different point of view.&#13;
...the decline in fertility among agricultural laborers&#13;
need not be seen as an indication of any improvement in&#13;
their quality of life. In the Kerala context, it can&#13;
equally well be seen as a sign of greater poverty. (p. 1787)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
There is some element of truth in what both Ratcliffe and Mencher&#13;
say. Redistributive policies did play a part in Kerala's fertility decline;&#13;
at the same time, some of this fertility decline may be characterized as&#13;
"poverty induced" or, more correctly, as the result of a decrease in income.&#13;
But this is not the whole story.,&#13;
We believe the changes in fertility rates are due as much to&#13;
historical developments as to recent policy interventions. Historical&#13;
developments prepared the ground whereby a reduction in fertility became not&#13;
only possible, but also beneficial to most families. Still, these&#13;
developments by themselves would not have produced either the type or the&#13;
degree of fertility decline that took place in the State over the past&#13;
fifteen years.  Recent policy interventions also played an essential role.&#13;
From Inherited to Acquired Status&#13;
The historical developments that lay behind the fertility decline&#13;
were numerous; but for analytical purposes, they may be characterized in&#13;
essence as a systematic erosion of the economic significance of a person's&#13;
inherited characteristics (his religion, caste, family ties) and the&#13;
simultaneous enhancement of the economic significance of his personal&#13;
attributes (education, training, experience, health). As Jeffrey writes in&#13;
The Decline of Nayar Dominance (1976):&#13;
In the last half of the 19th century a society which&#13;
had survived fundamentally unchanged for 700 years&#13;
came unhinged. A movement from inherited to achieved&#13;
status began, a movement from the interdependence of&#13;
of castes to the competition of individuals, from&#13;
traditional authority to modern bureaucracy. (p.267)&#13;
One good illustration of this transition may be seen in the&#13;
changing criteria for admission to the government service of the former&#13;
Travancore and Cochin States. Government service has been and still is one&#13;
of the most coveted occupations in the State. Earlier, these services&#13;
involved not only the usual responsibilities such as law and order and tax&#13;
collection, but also administration of temples and related responsibilities.&#13;
As non-Hindus and low-caste Hindus were not allowed in Hindu temples,&#13;
government service was restricted to high-caste Hindus--Brahmins and Nairs in&#13;
particular. Among the high-caste Hindus, those who were close to the&#13;
Maharajah had a much greater chance of obtaining such service.    Educational&#13;
attainment or other personal attributes were secondary to inherited&#13;
characteristics. This practice began to change with the expansion of the&#13;
government's responsibilities away from temple-related functions to new areas&#13;
such as education, health, public works, and so on; with the introduction of&#13;
a minimum educational qualification for entry into government service; and&#13;
with the overall bureaucratization of the administration. Today the&#13;
transition is almost complete. A person's chance of getting into government&#13;
service depends almost entirely on acquired attributes--education, training&#13;
and experience, health, and the like. A young person's lifetime income is&#13;
determined more by these than by the caste to which he belongs, or the family&#13;
into which he was born, or the land or other assets he owns or will probably&#13;
inherit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
The transition from inherited to achieved status began with the&#13;
British influence on the administration of Tranvancore and Cochin States, and&#13;
with the development and spread of education and medicine by the foreign&#13;
missionaries. The local Christians, who were closer to the missionaries than&#13;
were the other communities, benefited most from these changes. Through&#13;
education, they began moving up the social and economic ladder. But the&#13;
other communities were not far behind; realizing the economic benefit which&#13;
the Christians were receiving from formal education, they began establishing&#13;
schools and hospitals for their people. The result was a healthy competition&#13;
among various groups and a rapid improvement in education and health in the&#13;
State as a whole. Unlike other parts of India where interreligious and&#13;
intercaste rivalries led to death and destruction, communal rivalry in Kerala&#13;
produced social progress and individual liberation.&#13;
"Take away communal spirit and you will kill communal&#13;
individuality, reduce all communities to one level and&#13;
retard progress." (Dewan Roghaviah, quoted in Ayar 1923)&#13;
Costs and Benefits of Children&#13;
Granted that such a transition took place in Kerala, how did it&#13;
induce a fertility decline? Chiefly through changes in the cost of children&#13;
relative to the family's income (see Figure 8.1). In the changed economic&#13;
perspective, children of higher quality became not merely desirable, they&#13;
became essential for upward social mobility and even for sheer economic&#13;
survival, both for the well-to-do are for the poor. Formerly the children of&#13;
the rich could fall back on the family's land or connections to make a decent&#13;
living and maintain their status in the society. This is no longer&#13;
possible. Lacking an adequate education, a person cannot make a living on&#13;
the basis of caste or religion or from land alone. For the poor and those of&#13;
low caste, education offers the only hope of getting out of the circle of&#13;
illiteracy, poor health, and poverty. With the recent political changes, and&#13;
with all the social and economic reforms favoring them, the poor see a chance&#13;
to improve their lives. Education is a key prerequisite.&#13;
Education has become cheaper as high schools and even colleges have&#13;
opened up within commuting distance of most people. The highly subsidized&#13;
and widely available transport system enables most children to pursue a&#13;
higher education while living at home. Although education has become&#13;
cheaper, those less well off are now spending more on education than&#13;
previously.  There is a simple explanation for this apparent paradox.     In&#13;
the past, education was expensive so few in the lower class could send their&#13;
children beyond primary school, which was always free. Now that the cost of&#13;
education has fallen, many in the lower classes are taking advantage of the&#13;
new opportunities. Their expenditures on education have therefore increased.&#13;
Rich and poor parents alike, desiring and needing higher quality&#13;
children, are spending more money on each child's education, food, clothes,&#13;
and medical care. But even without any change in the cost per child, the&#13;
total cost to a family of bringing up children would have increased because&#13;
of the decrease in infant and child mortality. Ninety percent of the&#13;
children born today survive to adulthood. Assuming a constant fertility&#13;
level, a family is faced with educational and other expenses for a larger&#13;
number of surviving children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

i42 &#13;
On the benefit side, a diezin.tion has to be made btafena&#13;
short-term and long-term benefits0 Child lcbor uca nover very coe=n in&#13;
Kerala, and in recent Years it is thought to hvav   icappecr       gaethero&#13;
As children began spending longer and loner@ poeriods in ochool, thaiT&#13;
economic contribution to the family became less and lscs    Even t-ithout&#13;
taking increased schooling into account,s the shoet-trm   conomic, benefit of&#13;
children has shrunk as the tight employment citustion has reduced their&#13;
chances to obtain paid uork outside the home0&#13;
On the other hand, there is every reason to beieeve that the&#13;
long-term benefits of children have increasoes even after in Esi3 alLouEnce&#13;
for the lag between the time then coots rar incmTred an&amp; t@h tinE when&#13;
benefits are reaped. But these benefito come only if the naecosary initial&#13;
investment Is made in a child's education. With the increoG    in both the&#13;
cost per child and the number of surviving children, ocst families in Kerela&#13;
simply do not have the resources to natke this initiaR in aetent too often0&#13;
They have therefore reduced their fa2ily cizee opt2ing faT c usLlE&amp;ndowed&#13;

One such element is the economic deprivation resulting from the&#13;
land reforms. Excess land (over the ceiling set by the government) was taken&#13;
from the owners by the government and distributed among the landless. Others&#13;
who did not own any excess land, but who had what land they did own&#13;
cultivated by tenants, lost their land for token compensation. The most&#13;
numerous of all land transfers involved the "hutment dwellers", 2/ who&#13;
acquired legal ownership of their house sites together with some land around&#13;
the house (about one-tenth of an acre in rural areas, less in urban areas).&#13;
Figure 9.1 gives a schematic representation of the impact of&#13;
economic deprivation on fertility. For those who lost land or other sources&#13;
of income, the effect was to increase the cost of children relative to&#13;
remaining income. Such people were economically well-off, accustomed to&#13;
giving their children good education, food, and health care. The sudden loss&#13;
of income did not change their desired behavior with respect to their&#13;
children's development; instead it caused them to make demographic&#13;
adjustments toward later marriages and fewer children.&#13;
If some groups lost land and other sources of income, others --&#13;
such as former tenants and hutment dwellers -- must have gained. It is&#13;
doubtful, however, whether former tenants benefited substantially by changes&#13;
in the legal ownership of land. Moreover, the risks involved in agriculture&#13;
and the cost of cultivation have increased considerably. The new&#13;
owner-cultivators who have their farming done by hired labor probably&#13;
experienced little significant increase in income due to the land reforms.&#13;
In many cases, their income decreased.&#13;
The case of the hutment dwellers is slightly different. They&#13;
experienced no economic deprivation. At the same time, after land reform&#13;
it became difficult for their older children to obtain house sites.&#13;
Marriages were postponed, and those who did marry changed their attitude&#13;
about desired family size.&#13;
A second element of the land and agrarian reforms, perhaps more&#13;
important than any resulting economic deprivations, were the wage increases.&#13;
Wage increases affected the fertility trend in two ways. First, the&#13;
short-term benefits from children fell. As Ratcliffe points out:&#13;
Finally, opportunities for child labour have been&#13;
virtually eliminated due to enforcement of minimum wage&#13;
and child labour laws... And when value of children as&#13;
employable economic assets declines, so does fertility.&#13;
(p. 139)&#13;
A similar point is made by Mencher regarding agricultural laborers:&#13;
...though the statutory minimum wage rates are high in&#13;
Kerala, the number of days for which employment is avail-&#13;
able for agricultural labourers is very small... In this&#13;
2/ Hutment dwellers are low-income households living in huts they have&#13;
constructed on land that belonged to others.&#13;

situation where agricultural labourers are in a sense&#13;
driven to the wall, I am arguing that while people still&#13;
want children, they do not see any economic advantage in&#13;
having large families and this--coupled with the fact that&#13;
with better medical facilities, the children that they have&#13;
are likely to live to adulthood--makes even agricultural&#13;
labourers (including the illiterate) amenable to family&#13;
planning. (p. 1787)&#13;
Wages have been kept artificially high in all economic sectors,&#13;
especially agriculture, by the powerful trade unions and a sympathetic&#13;
government. As a result, the volume of employment has decreased considerably&#13;
and employment opportunities for children and adolescents have disappeared&#13;
altogether.&#13;
The higher wages and better working conditions introduced by the&#13;
agrarian reforms had another important effect: they increased the income&#13;
potential and thereby the opportunity cost of women. The income potential of&#13;
women has also increased through education, but this applies only to those&#13;
who complete high school or college. Thus, as a consequence of agrarian&#13;
reforms, income from children has decreased at the same time that the&#13;
opportunity cost of mothers has increased. Both changes tend to reduce the&#13;
desired family size of both the rich and the poor, but especially of the&#13;
latter, and to make them receptive to family planning.&#13;
The Official Family Planning Program&#13;
A good deal of the credit for the sharp fertility decline among the&#13;
agricultural laborers and other economically backward sections of Kerala's&#13;
population should go to the official family planning program. The&#13;
socioeconomic and demographic conditions we have been discussing created a&#13;
situation in which a fertility decline was both possible and desirable. But&#13;
without the official family planning program, it is doubtful whether a&#13;
fertility decline of the magnitude observed in the lower class would have&#13;
taken place.&#13;
The official family planning program in Kerala is not only a means&#13;
for providing contraceptive services; it has also been an independent causal&#13;
factor in changing family size norms, and in creating and strengthening&#13;
demand for family planning services. As Freedman says in his reassessment of&#13;
the theory of fertility transition (1979):&#13;
I now believe there is a case for the thesis that once&#13;
motivation is present, both the concept of and the means&#13;
for family limitation can have independent causal effects in&#13;
determining both the timing of the onset and the rapidity&#13;
of the fertility decline. (p.8)&#13;
In the case of Kerala, the official family planning program has&#13;
gone one step further. As a result of the economic incentives offered to&#13;
officials and acceptors, the program was able to create demand even where it&#13;
did not previously exist. Thus, the program provided services where demand&#13;
existed, strengthened demand where it was weak, and created demand,&#13;
especially among the poor, where no demand existed previously.&#13;

Empirical Evidence&#13;

changes - are timese:ries on fertility rEats and the idutisirii cEa.,sal&#13;
variables. But the data at our disposal are limited to those col._ected in &gt;&#13;
one-time survey in 1980. The fertility decline took piece moo'ay during a&#13;
20year period prior to the survey; the land rforms and other zgrarian&#13;
reforms were implemented mostly between 1960 gnd 1970; and the o.mpESvemznzC&#13;

Cost of Children&#13;
The survey has not made a systematic study of the cot increases in&#13;
education0  However, some data on at¢¢titudes about the desired l.cvel of&#13;
education tdere collected and these are pertinent to the i2sue c  cosot.&#13;
Our assertion about the cost increase of bringing up children is&#13;
based on the assumptions that the desire for higher education '7s become very&#13;
widespread in Kerala, that the average decirei length of achooX.ng has&#13;
increased substantially, and that the number of surviving children per family&#13;
to be educated has also increased substsntiazlly0  The last poir;tc ic tiell&#13;

The desired-years of schooling is not a fictitious number. A&#13;
majority of women (63 percent) felt that their children would achieve their&#13;
educational goals. The other 37 percent, however, thought that their&#13;
children might not do so. Several reasons were given, but the most important&#13;
one was lack of money (Table 9.3).     one out of four women surveyed felt that&#13;
financial problems would stand in the way of their children's staying in&#13;
school,for the desired number of years. More younger women than older ones&#13;
reported this, indicating the possibility of a rising trend in the cost of&#13;
education.&#13;
Thus, although the survey does not provide direct data on the&#13;
subject, it does provide sufficient indirect evidence to support the&#13;
hypothesis that each family must allocate a larger share of its income to&#13;
educational expenses than was true in years past. While the cost of&#13;
educating an individual child to a certain level has perhaps declined, the&#13;
total educational cost per family has grown considerably, due to the increase&#13;
in both desired length of schooling and number of surviving children.&#13;
And this is true for all classes of society.&#13;

Benefits from Children&#13;
The benefits from children have not kept pace with the rise in cost&#13;
discussed above, according to our hypothesis. While there is no reason to&#13;
believe that the long-term benefits from children who receive a good&#13;
education have decreased, there is every reason to believe that the&#13;
short-term benefits -- those realized while the children are still young --&#13;
have fallen significantly.&#13;
Short-term benefits. All women with children in the 8-12 year age&#13;
group were asked whether their children help them around the house.     Those&#13;
with children twelve years or older were asked further whether their children&#13;
worked and contributed to the household income.&#13;
Table 9.4 gives the data on children's helping around the house.&#13;
Most women (66 percent) felt that their children were a great help. There is&#13;
no significant variation in answers by age of the mother, indicating the&#13;
absence of any trend regarding this short-term benefit. If there is any&#13;
decrease in the help given, it is because children are away at school, not&#13;
because they do not help when at home.&#13;

Financial help from children twelve and over was less prevalent&#13;
(Table 9.5). The reason was not that children were unwilling to share their&#13;
wages (96 percent of working children gave their wages to the household), but&#13;
rather that they were not working. Only 38 percent of the children had ever&#13;
worked for pay. Of the mothers whose children contributed to the household&#13;
income, most (80 percent) were in the 40-49 age group. In short, about one&#13;
in three households received some direct financial contribution from their&#13;
children, but much of this contribution came only when the couples were&#13;
somewhat older. For women in the prime reproductive ages, the immediate&#13;
benefits from children were limited to help with the household chores.&#13;
Financial assistance was something to look forward to later, if their&#13;
children could find jobs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Long-term benefits0   All evsrsmarried women were also tLoed about&#13;
their expectation of long-term benefits freo their children. ett "DlzticulzTD&#13;
they were asked&#13;
whether their children are likely to help the family later on;&#13;
what means of financial support they might have wAhen they become&#13;
old; and&#13;
whether they expect to live with their children when Ehey (the&#13;
children) grow up.&#13;
One important aspect of the determinEnts of fertility I1n Xerala is&#13;
brought out by the answers to these questionso Table 906 indicvtes that all&#13;

The data provided considerable support for the hypothesis that the&#13;
expected long-term benefits from children are very high in Kerala.    Since the&#13;
educational attainment of children is increasing, the benefits from them&#13;
should also be increasing. The anticipated dependence on children for old&#13;
age economic security should affect desired family size; parents will&#13;
attempt to ensure that they have at least one son to care for them.&#13;
The desired family size has declined to a mode of 3 in response to&#13;
the substantial increase in child survivorship. For it to decline further,&#13;
say to replacement level, would require assurance of some alternate means of&#13;
old age support. The fertility decline in Kerala might reach a plateau&#13;
unless this problem is satisfactorily resolved.&#13;
In order to understand more precisely how the cost-benefit ratio of&#13;
children influences the fertility trend, we shall review the survey's&#13;
findings on the link between fertility on the one hand and certain&#13;
socioeconomic changes on the other. These changes relate to education,&#13;
infant mortality, land and other agrarian reforms, and the official family&#13;
planning program.&#13;
Education&#13;
It was hypothesized above that in the changed socioeconomic&#13;
environment in Kerala, educating one-s children has become a necessity; and&#13;
as education has spread, so has both the desire and the ability to produce a&#13;
smaller family. Education has had a multitude of effects: it has increased&#13;
the cost of rearing children, reduced their economic benefit, increased the&#13;
opportunity cost of women, increased the risk of unemployment at younger&#13;
ages, helped couples to make rational decisions about family size, and&#13;
enabled them to use contraceptives more effectively. If our hypothesis is&#13;
correct, education should be negatively related to the desired number of&#13;
children. The changed attitude about family size, in turn, should increase&#13;
the age at marriage and/or increase family planning practice and thus reduce&#13;
the number of children born.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Desired family size.   Table 9.8 gives the desired family size by&#13;
educational attainment of the mother.   As expected, educated women desire a&#13;
smaller family than illiterate women-the difference is 1.4 children between&#13;
those with no schooling and those with at least ten years of schooling.    That&#13;
this difference is not entirely due to differences in age distribution is&#13;
shown by the standardized averages, which also decline systematically with an&#13;
increase in years of schooling.&#13;
Age at marriage.   The lower desired family size of educated women&#13;
is achieved through later marriage and/or fertility control within marriage.&#13;
The age at marriage should therefore be positively related to years of&#13;
schooling. Table 9.8 indicates that illiterate women begin married life 4.3&#13;
years earlier than women with at least ten years of schooling. Among&#13;
recently married women, the difference is smaller (2.7 years among those&#13;
married in 1975-80, compared with 7.2 years among those married before 1960),&#13;
but adjustment for the year of marriage does not remove all differences. The&#13;
standardized averages show a spread of 3.5 years. Thus, one avenue by which&#13;
educational attainment reduces fertility is through a reduction in the period&#13;
of exposure to childbearing due to delayed marriage. Can this account for&#13;
the entire difference? Apparently not. Rough calculations show that during&#13;
the years 1950-80, out of the total educational differential in fertility, 55&#13;
percent was due to an increase in the age of marriage and 45 percent to&#13;
reduced fertility rates within marriage (Annex Table 6).&#13;

Family planning. Fertility reductions within marriage are achieved&#13;
principally through use of contraceptives or sterilization. If educated&#13;
married women desire fewer children, they should know more about family&#13;
planning and practice contraception more often than illiterate women. Table&#13;
9.9 gives the necessary data for comparison. The overall relationship&#13;
between education and both family planning knowledge and use is positive.&#13;
With respect to sterilization, however, the relationship is curvilinear; the&#13;
maximum sterilization rate is to be found among women with six years of&#13;
schooling (see Figure 7.1.). Factors other than, and not positively&#13;
correlated with, education -- such as financial incentives -- help'determine&#13;
whether a person accepts sterilization or not. This could explain departures&#13;
from the expected overall negative relationship between fertility level and&#13;
educational attainment.&#13;

Excess fertility. Among the women surveyed who had more than or&#13;
equal to the number of children they desired, about 58 percent used some&#13;
fertility control method. The degree of effort to avoid undesired&#13;
pregnancies was much greater among the more educated, however (Table 9.10).&#13;
Among women with ten or more years of schooling, 76 percent practiced&#13;
contraception; among illiterate women, only 37 percent did so, even though&#13;
they already had more children than they desired.&#13;

Fertility. Several measures of fertility based essentially on&#13;
birth history are given in Table 9.11.     They all show, in essence, that the&#13;
more a woman is educated, the fewer number of children she has or the lower&#13;
her fertility. Among older women (with marriages of 25 years or more), the&#13;
illiterate women have 1.4 children more than the women with at least ten&#13;
years of schooling. This difference has narrowed in recent years, to only&#13;
about 0.7 children for the period 1975-79.&#13;

and official pressure.&#13;

The direct effect of education on children ever-born was -0.1151,&#13;
with an F-value of 5.7, and the indirect effect through desired family size&#13;
and age at marriage was -0.2089.&#13;
Desired family size and age at marriage are not the only ways by&#13;
which education could have affected fertility. For example, we have not&#13;
taken into consideration infant mortality, which is negatively related to&#13;
education of the mother.    The present analysis therefore underestimates the&#13;
impact of education on fertility.&#13;
Infant Mortality&#13;
Among the Indian States, Kerala is unique when it comes to infant&#13;
deaths; its mortality rate has been and still is the lowest in the country.&#13;
The probability of a baby dying during its first twelve months of life is&#13;
three times greater in India than in Kerala. This low mortality rate, with&#13;
its recent rapid decline, has been proposed as one of the principal factors&#13;
underlying the much larger fertility decline in Kerala than in the rest of&#13;
India. Is there any empirical support for this hypothesis?&#13;
A crude indication of the possible impact of the low mortality&#13;
level on the fertility decline in Kerala is provided by regional fertility&#13;
and mortality data. As seen in Table 9.13, the mortality decline began in&#13;
the southern parts of the State (Travancore-Cochin) and later spread to its&#13;
northern part (Malabar). It is no coincidence that the fertility decline&#13;
also began earlier and is much larger in the south.&#13;

Short-term effect. Mortality decline is a slow process, and much&#13;
of its effect on fertility permeates rather slowly. There are, however, some&#13;
short-term effects as well. One such effect is on birth intervals. An&#13;
infant's death cuts short the period of breast-feeding, reduces the period of&#13;
postpartum amenorrhea, shortens the interval between births, and thereby&#13;
increases fertility. A decline in infant mortaility would therefore decrease&#13;
fertility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Empirical data to test this assumption is given in Tabla 9o14o All&#13;
births of a given order (for example, first births) are classiTied according&#13;
to mortality experience (for example, Dhether the child died du,rlng the first&#13;
month or during the first through eleventh month, or survived the first&#13;
twelve months); also, the average birth interval between that birth order and&#13;
the next birth order is calculated (for example, between first and second&#13;
births) for each mortality experience. A comparison of the average birth&#13;
intervals indicates how much influence the death of a child ha oan the&#13;
subsequent birth intervalo&#13;

If the death of a child in infancy reduces the next birth interval&#13;
as shown in Table 9.15, then the occurrence of a twin birth should increase&#13;
the next birth interval for the same reasons. Twin births are relatively&#13;
infrequent, but the few cases that were reported indicate that such an&#13;
increase did occur (Table 9.16). The average birth interval for all births&#13;
in Kerala was 32.7 months; but for births following a twin birth, in which&#13;
both twins survived infancy, it was 40.1 months. Among twin births, the&#13;
subsequent birth interval was smaller when one of the twins died in infancy&#13;
and smallest when both the twins died.&#13;

In conclusion, the short-term effect of infant survival on&#13;
fertility can be estimated as a ratio of the increase in the birth interval&#13;
due to infant survival compared to the birth interval in cases of infant&#13;
death. In Kerala the ratio was 9.5 = 0.4,&#13;
24&#13;
which indicates that corresponding to the survival of every infant there is a&#13;
short-term fertility decrease of 0.4 or two-fifths of a child. Thus the data&#13;
support the hypothesis that part of the fertility decline in Kerala was due&#13;
to the drop in the infant mortality rate, which fell from a level of above&#13;
150 per thousand live births before 1950 to a level below 50 by 1980. It is&#13;
difficult, however, to measure the full impact of this change on fertility.&#13;
The direct effect on birth intervals is likely to be only a small fraction of&#13;
all the indirect effects operating through a wide range of intermediate&#13;
variables.&#13;
Long-term effects. As mentioned above, much of the impact of&#13;
mortality decline on fertility is long-term; it operates through a change in&#13;
the desired family size. If mortality declines substantially, as it did in&#13;
Kerala, parents need to bear fewer children to achieve the size family they&#13;
want. Between 1950 and 1980, the probability of survival from birth to ages&#13;
15-19 years increased by about 25 percent. Therefore, parents could reduce&#13;
the number of children ever-born by 25 percent without this necessitating any&#13;
decrease in the desired size of their family. If couples do not have fewer&#13;
children -- and many did not in the initial phase of mortality decline --&#13;
then the number of surviving children will increase, the family's cost of&#13;
bringing up its children will increase, and this will ultimately lead to a&#13;
decline in the desired family size.&#13;
Land Reforms and Agrarian Reforms&#13;
Land reform was hypothesized as one of the redistributive policies&#13;
that affected fertility -- through a decrease in income of the landed class;&#13;
through a decrease in income of the middle-class farmers; and through an&#13;
increase in housing problems among the hutment dwellers. We were thus led to&#13;
expect a faster dcline in fertility among these who lost rather than gained&#13;
land, and a tendency to postpone marriage and to control fertility within&#13;
marriage among the hutment dwellers. The available data permitted a partial&#13;
testing of these assumptions. The survey collected information on all land&#13;
transfers carried out by the sample households during the preceding decade.&#13;
The following questions were used:&#13;
During 1970-80,&#13;
-   has the amount of land owned and/or cultivated by the household&#13;
increased, decreased, or remained unchanged?&#13;
-   how much land was purchased by the household; how much was sold?&#13;
-   how much land was received as a gift; how much was given away as&#13;
a gift?&#13;
-   how much land was gained or received through land reforms; how&#13;
much was given away or lost through land reforms?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
162 -&#13;
The last question asks specifical' y about land taEnsfers due to land&#13;
reforms. Since the reference period was 1970-80, which does notS coveT the&#13;
entire land reform period, not all such land t &amp;nofers are inclzvded0    3ut use&#13;
of a longer period (say 1960=80) would have reaulted in s much :.arger recall&#13;
lapseO&#13;
The survey data indicate that 285 households (only 22.7. of which&#13;
included an ever-married woman 15=49 years old) had gained land thrcugh lnd&#13;
reformEs, hile 60 householdz (41 of which included an ever--maxrzLed Loman&#13;
15=49 years old) had net losses. The average net gain was only 11 cents; 3/&#13;
the average loss was much higher, 184 cents0    The distributio$a Df households&#13;
that gained land through land reforms shows that 89 percent cf th£m had gafns&#13;
of 10 cents or less (Table 9.17)o 'Thus, neErly 90 percent of call gains are&#13;
likely to have been transfers of land to the hutmsnt dwellers0&#13;

Fertility and landowners hpO   An indirect ind&amp;cation of the impact&#13;
of land transfers on fertility ic obtained from the overall rTelationship&#13;
between fertility and landownership0    For sx2mpae, if fertility ,tS not&#13;
related to landownership, it is possible that a decrease or incTease in&#13;
amount of land owned (due to land roform) wilY not influence fe-cztltity. If&#13;
land is a factor, however, its transfer from one household to Facther could&#13;
have some effect on the fertility of tomen in the households affected0      Table&#13;
9018 presents the available data0    In the past, fertility and landow2ership&#13;
were negatively related:   women in households with larger landEnoldings had a&#13;
slightly lower fertility than women in households with smaller 3.andholdings.&#13;
But the association seems to have waskened in recent yearsO .Tns&#13;

Regression analysis confirms the lack of any significant&#13;
association between fertility and landholdings, but it contradicts the past&#13;
negative relationship. Table 9.19 shows that the partial regression&#13;
coefficient of landholding and births during 1965-74 is positive and&#13;
statistically significant, but that fertility measures in more recent periods&#13;
are not related to landownership.&#13;

Fertility and changes in landholdings. More relevant to our&#13;
analysis is the relationship between recent fertility and changes in&#13;
landholdings. The number of households that had experienced an increase or&#13;
decrease in land owned due to land reform alone is not large, so land&#13;
transfers through gift, purchase, and sale are also included.&#13;
The general fertility rates for the relevant categories of married&#13;
women 15-49 years are given in Table 9.20. In 1975-79 women in households&#13;
that gained land had higher fertility than those in households that neither&#13;
gained nor lost land. This conclusion is the same whatever the source of&#13;
land gain. Similarly, women in households that lost land have, on the whole,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 -&#13;
a relatively lower fertility than those in households that did not change&#13;
their landholding status. The sample size of women in households which lost&#13;
land specifically through land reform is too small (41) to yield meaningful&#13;
fertility rates, so no definite conclusion can be drawn about this particular&#13;
group of women.&#13;

A higher fertility rate among women in households which gained land&#13;
is in accordance with the expectation of our theoretical model. But whether&#13;
the observed differences are statistically significant, and whether they are&#13;
due to factors other than land transfers, are questions not answered by Table&#13;
9.20. A multivariate regression analysis can partially fill this gap.&#13;
A regression analysis of births during 1975-79 on socioeconomic&#13;
variables 4/ and land transfer variables gave the following coefficients for&#13;
land transfer variables:&#13;
4/   The socioeconomic variables include caste, education of wife and&#13;
husband, and household expenditures.&#13;

Land transfer due to all causes                0.02726 (1.55)&#13;
Note: The figures in parentheses give the t-values.&#13;
None of the coefficients are statistically significant. Thus, the&#13;
observed higher fertility of women in households which gained land (Table&#13;
9.20) is due more to other socioeconomic differences between these women than&#13;
to those associated with land transfers.&#13;
The lack of a significant association between recent fertility and&#13;
landownership or land transfers during 1970-80 can be explained by the type&#13;
of family planning services available. The principal method of birth control&#13;
in Kerala is sterilization. According to the survey, 19 percent of all women&#13;
were using a conventional family planning method, which in about two-thirds&#13;
of the cases were ineffective, while 29 percent of the women were sterilized&#13;
or had a sterilized husband. The percentage of sterilized couples was higher&#13;
among households with small landholdings, undoubtedly due to the fact that&#13;
acceptance of sterilization is determined as much if not more by the&#13;
financial incentives attached to it as by the felt need for effective family&#13;
planning. A fixed economic incentive is of more value to the landless than&#13;
to rich landlords. The partial regression between landholdings and&#13;
sterilization status was negative and statistically significant, indicating&#13;
that through greater adoption of sterilization, families owning small amounts&#13;
of land were able to bring down their fertility faster than families with&#13;
large landholdings. As a result, by 1980 the fertility differentials between&#13;
landholding classes were very small indeed.&#13;
Land transfers and fertility-related (intermediate) variables. The&#13;
largest category of households affected, according to our theoretical&#13;
framework, is that of the hutment dwellers. We have already suggested that&#13;
the full effect of land reform on the fertility of hutment dwellers is yet to&#13;
come through increased housing problems, consequent postponement of&#13;
marriages, and increased practice of birth control. To test the survey data&#13;
for any supporting evidence of this, we estimated regression coefficients&#13;
between some of these variables and land transfers. The results are&#13;
displayed in Table 9.21.&#13;

Notes: A positive coefficient for desired age at marriage means that&#13;
those who gained land desire a higher age at marriage for girls. A positive&#13;
coefficient for sterilization means that those who gained land are more&#13;
likely to be sterilized than those who did not gain land.&#13;
a.   The independent variables are used in three separate regressions&#13;
along with other socioeconomic variables not shown here.&#13;
b.   Statistically significant.   The figures in parentheses give the&#13;
t-values.&#13;
The desire for one more child is not related to any of the land&#13;
transfer variables, nor is the use of a conventional family planning method.&#13;
Desired age at marriage and sterilization status of the woman or her husband&#13;
do, however, show a positive correlation with land gains. The desired age at&#13;
marriage for girls as stated by women in households which have gained land&#13;
through land reforms -- most of whom are hutment dwellers -- is significantly&#13;
higher than that given by women not affected by land reforms. Similarly,&#13;
women in households that gained land through land reforms are more likely to&#13;
be sterilized or have a sterilized husband than those in households not&#13;
affected by land reforms. It is difficult to arrive at any conclusion about&#13;
women in households that have lost land through land reform as their number&#13;
is too small for separate analysis.&#13;
Before we draw additional conclusions from this analysis, it is&#13;
important to test whether the statistically significant relationships between&#13;
land transfers and both sterilization status and desired age at marriage are&#13;
actually due to the transfer of land, rather than to the total amount of land&#13;
owned. Landownership, remember, is negatively related to sterilization&#13;
status. Regressions including both landownership and land transfers during&#13;
1970-80 indicate that land transfers have an independent effect on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
sterilization status and on desired age at marriage. The observed higher&#13;
sterilization rate among those who gained land as a result of land reform is&#13;
not due to the small size of the total landholdings owned by those families.&#13;
Nor is the higher desired age at marriage due to the size of the&#13;
landholdings. The relationship holds even when controlled for the amount of&#13;
land owned. In fact, land owned as a variable by itself has no significant&#13;
relationship with desired age at marriage. These conclusions give some&#13;
empirical support to the hypothesis that the land reforms, by cutting off&#13;
future house sites for the poor, have brought about a worsening of the&#13;
housing problem and in that way helped stimulate fertility decline in Kerala.&#13;
We can return now to our original hypothesis: that land reforms&#13;
affected fertility through a decrease in income of the landed class, who lost&#13;
land through land reforms; through a decrease in income of the middle-class&#13;
farmers, who were accustomed to having their farming done almost entirely&#13;
through hired labor; and through an increase in the housing problems of the&#13;
hutment dwellers, who found themselves unable to obtain new house sites for&#13;
their grown-up children. Does the survey in fact indicate a faster decline&#13;
in fertility among those who lost land than among those who gained land, and&#13;
a tendency among hutment dwellers to postpone marriage and to control&#13;
fertility within marriage?&#13;
The data showed a slightly higher fertility rate among those who&#13;
gained land than among those not affected by land transfer, but a regression&#13;
analysis indicated that the observed differences could not be attributed to&#13;
land transfers during 1970-80. The partial regression between fertility in&#13;
1975-79 and land transfers of whatever kind in 1970-79 was not statistically&#13;
significant. As a matter of fact, the amount of land owned by a household&#13;
had very little relevance to fertility, no doubt because much of the&#13;
fertility decline in Kerala is the result of sterilization, which is&#13;
negatively associated with landownership.&#13;
It is premature, however, to conclude that land reforms had no&#13;
effect on reducing fertility in Kerala; much of the effect is yet to come.&#13;
There is already some indication that the hutment dwellers (households with&#13;
less than 10 cents of land) are modifying their family-building habits; the&#13;
land reforms have played a part in this change.&#13;
The major effect of land reforms on Kerala's fertility, however, is&#13;
likely to come about not through land transfers, but through a change in&#13;
values. Land reforms and the related redistributive policies of the&#13;
post-Independence governments of Kerala have fundamentally altered the&#13;
attitude of people toward landed property as a source of economic security.&#13;
Land was long the principal means of income for a household, its most&#13;
important economic asset. But no longer. Land -- particularly agricultural&#13;
land -- has lost much of its prime position in the economics of Kerala&#13;
society. Personal attributes -- education and health -- have taken its&#13;
place. This fundamental reorientation of values has had, and will continue&#13;
to have, a much deeper and more long-lasting effect on the demand for&#13;
fertility control than the physical redistribution of land brought about by&#13;
land reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Official Family Planning Program&#13;
Much of the fertility decline among sarried wCmen occurs through&#13;
family planning, conscious or unconsecious   All" family planning need not&#13;
result from the efforts of an official program, however0    In fact, in many&#13;
populations family planning practice has nothing to do eith offficial policels&#13;
or programs; they do not exist.   In the case of Ierals, ,owever, the officile&#13;
program -- according to our hypothesis     has been a major factor in reducing&#13;
fertility, not only among those who wanted fewer children, but also among the&#13;
indifferent and among those who were attracted to the financial Incentives&#13;
offered,&#13;
Hot all analysts of the Kerala situation have shared this view0&#13;
Heair (1974) concluded that the fertility decline in Kerala began in the early&#13;
1960s prior to the intensification of the family planning progrxm, wlth&#13;
education and mortality factors playing a critical role. Yrishnen (1976), on&#13;
the other hand, pointed to changes in the aerriazge rates brought about by&#13;
sharply increased female literacy0   lurup and Cecil (AS76) attrhbuted the&#13;
decline in the birth rate mainly to increased acceptance of the family&#13;
planning program0 As mentioned earlier, Ratcliffe (1978) did not think that&#13;
the family planning program played any major role in the fertiLitty decline0&#13;
le agree with Nair that some decline in the birth rate and in the&#13;
total fertility rate (but not in the marital fertility rate) tck place&#13;
before the intensification of the official family planning program, primarily&#13;
because of a fall in the nuptiality rate0 A significent decline zin the&#13;
marital fertility rates, however, began only in the S96Os, coinciding with&#13;
the implementation of land reform and the intenseification of the family&#13;
planning program.&#13;
What empirical evidence can be given to support our hypothescs?&#13;
Nethodologically, it is rather difficult to chow what would have happened to&#13;
Kerala's fertility trend without the official program0 Three approaches were&#13;
adopted in an attempt to answer this questicng&#13;
-    comparison of the fertility level and trends with of ffcial family&#13;
planning outputs;&#13;
-    comparison of the Kerala and Sri Lan1ka experiences; and&#13;
-    analysis of the cheracteristics of family planning users among whon&#13;
fertility has declinedo&#13;
Before we compare the fertility decline with the o9ffcial family&#13;
planning output, it L worth recalling one interesting sapect o&amp; the&#13;
relationship between family planning practice and fertility0 tIhe relevant&#13;
partial regressions (unotandardized) are reproduced balowg&#13;

Children born, 1979                  -0.058       16.0&#13;
a. Statistically insignificant.&#13;
These data show that, on the whole, family planning practice and&#13;
children ever-born are positively related. The relationship goes from&#13;
fertility to family planning and not the other way around. High fertility&#13;
women tend to adopt birth control methods. However, when the relationship is&#13;
examined separately for births which took place in specific periods, the&#13;
direction of the association changes from a significant positive value for&#13;
births in 1965-69, to an insignificant relationship in 1970-74, and back to&#13;
a significant but negative relationship for births in 1975-79 and 1979.&#13;
In other words, the direction of the relationship seems to have been&#13;
reversed in recent years, with birth control practice affecting fertility&#13;
rather than the other way around. This provides one bit of evidence that the&#13;
stronger, more recent official family planning efforts have made some dent on&#13;
fertility in Kerala.&#13;
Fertility decline and family planning output. Table 9.22 shows the&#13;
fertility level and the number of births averted by acceptance of the family&#13;
planning methods, including sterilization, offered by the official program.&#13;
A comparison for the three most recent five-year periods indicates that the&#13;
two are negatively related; the rank correlation coefficient is -0.7, which&#13;
is statistically significant for the nine observations.&#13;

Using the service statistics regarding acceptors by method,&#13;
estimates of the births averted by tes official family planning progrem were&#13;
obtained and compared with the decline in number of births0 It Eppears that&#13;
births averted were greater than the decline in each districto 0or the State&#13;
as a whole, almost all of the reduction in the birth rate not attributable to&#13;
an increase in age at marriage could be accounted for by family planning&#13;
acceptance through the official program.&#13;
Comparison with Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is similar to Xerala in its&#13;
socioeconomic development. The relevant indicators are very close, but those&#13;
of Kerala are systematically lower. The population density is much higher in&#13;
Kerala, but it has a safety valve wlhereas Sri Lanka does noto   lCrala is part&#13;
of India, and its people can freely migrate throughout the country in search&#13;
of economic opportunities. Sri Lanka is an island, and any movem:ent out of&#13;
it is restricted by the usual formalities of bmrk permits, vises, exit&#13;
permits, and so ono Cn balance, one would expect that if there were no&#13;
government influence, these two populations would have more or lecs the sans&#13;
family planning use rates0 If the rates were different, especia.lly If they&#13;
were lower in Sri Lanka, this could be attrlbuted to dilferences in the&#13;
official family planning programs.&#13;
Figures 9.4 and 9.5 compare sterilizatton and conventlonal famly&#13;
planning rates in Kerala and Sri Lanka0   The data for Xerala are from this&#13;
study and refer to 1979, The data for Sri Lanka are taken from the IVTorld&#13;
Fertility Survey and refer to 1975. Although later data are avaffLible for&#13;
Sri Lanka, we have used the 1975 rates because they are not affected ay the&#13;
recent, more active nature of the official family planning progzam0&#13;
These figures indicate that the two populations have quite similar&#13;
rates for conventional family planning practice, but very differe:nt rates for&#13;
sterilization0   If Kerala had no strong official program promoting&#13;
sterilization, its sterilization rate would probably not have been very much&#13;
different from that in Sri Lanka0   We attribute the difference in&#13;
sterilization rates to the official family plnniLng program0&#13;
What was the consequence of this difference in starili2zaion rates&#13;
on fertility levels in Kerala during 1975--Y9?   The expected effect is a de-&#13;
cline of 0Q92 children per woman (Table 9023)o    This was obtained by estimat-&#13;
ing the average number of children that would heve been born to tz.he tamen who&#13;
were sterilized in Kerala in excecs cf the number sterlliad in Sri Lanka,&#13;
and then applying the fertility schedule of the steriliged women (Table 4.16)&#13;
to all married women05/ The actual decline was 1077 (Annex Table 4). Thus,&#13;
about 52 percent of the marital fertil7ty decline could be attribued&#13;
directly to the official family planning program, while 48 percent of the&#13;
decline would have taken place even if the government had not trken any&#13;
initiative in limiting birthso&#13;
5/   Which set of fertility schedules bact   eascures the ratne of the&#13;
sterilized group is debatableo We have used the rates for the fntermdiae&#13;
time period, a sort of average for the entire period under study, 1965-79o&#13;

Data from our survey indicate that about 30 percent of the&#13;
fertility decline during 1968-78 was due to a decrease in the rate at which&#13;
women were marrying (Annex Table 13). This has nothing to do with the&#13;
government's family planning program; it is a response to socioeconomic&#13;
changes. Combining these two, we may conclude that about 36 percent of the&#13;
decline in the total fertility rate (.70 x .52) was due to the official&#13;
program; the balance of 64 percent (.30 + [.48 x .70]) would have taken place&#13;
because of the socioeconomic changes, irrespective of the official program.&#13;
Characteristics of acceptors. A third piece of evidence supporting&#13;
the contribution of the official family planning program to Kerala-s&#13;
fertility decline involves the socioeconomic characteristics of the family&#13;
planning and sterilization acceptors. In a population undergoing demographic&#13;
transition without government input through family planning services, and&#13;
particularly without financial incentives, birth control practice would, on&#13;
the whole, be positively related to economic and social status. Those better&#13;
educated, those richer, those with nonagricultural occupations would tend to&#13;
limit births more than the illiterate, the poorer, the farmers. In Kerala,&#13;
we did not see this pattern. Our data indicated that sterilization was most&#13;
prevalent among women with 1-4 years of schooling, not among those with more&#13;
than ten years of schooling (Figure 7.1); among the Ezawas and Scheduled&#13;
Castes, not among the Nairs (Annex Table 19); and among women from households&#13;
with a per capita monthly expenditure of Rs. 50-59, not among those with&#13;

Chapter 10. The Kerala Experience: Policy and Research Implications&#13;
Kerala has experienced one of the sharpest fertility declines in the&#13;
South Asia region. With levels of income and nutrition among the lowest in&#13;
the world, this Indian State has achieved results in controlling population&#13;
growth comparable to those in the most successful middle-income countries.&#13;
Our research was designed to uncover the reasons for this apparent anomaly.&#13;
Having concluded our analysis, we may now ask whether population programs in&#13;
the other States of India have anything to gain from heeding the lessons&#13;
learned from a study of the fertility decline in Kerala.&#13;
Since Kerala's fertility decline was due as much to historical&#13;
factors as to recent policy interventions, it is not entirely replicable in&#13;
other parts of India. Nevertheless, some understanding of what happened in&#13;
Kerala and why should prove useful in reorganizing the population programs&#13;
elsewhere in the country.&#13;
An increase in age at marriage is a familiar prescription for fertil-&#13;
ity transition not only for India, but also for most other developing coun-&#13;
tries. All populations which have undergone fertility transitions started&#13;
with an increase in the age at marriage. Kerala is no exception. About 30&#13;
percent of the fertility decline in Kerala during 1968-78 could be attributed&#13;
to fewer married women at younger ages. During 1975-79 the average age at&#13;
marriage was about 20 for the three survey districts. The difference between&#13;
Kerala and all the other States of India is very large indeed. For example,&#13;
if the proportions married in India in 1971 had been the same as in Kerala,&#13;
the total fertility rate there would be lower by 20 percent. This is the&#13;
direct consequence. There would, of course, be substantial indirect&#13;
consequences as well, through increased adoption of family planning methods&#13;
for example.&#13;
The potential for fertility reduction through increased age at&#13;
marriage is very significant and is untapped so far in much of India. The&#13;
Kerala study did not discover any easy way to delay the age at which women&#13;
marry. Among the variables that can be manipulated, female education showed&#13;
the strongest positive association with age at marriage. 1/ Thus, education&#13;
seems the best way to ensure a higher age at marriage for Indian women.&#13;
The Kerala study indicated that about 60 percent of the decline in&#13;
marital fertility during the past decade could be attributed to socioeconomic&#13;
factors and the balance to the official family planning program. Even if&#13;
Kerala did not have an official family planning program, the fertility rate&#13;
in the State would have declined sharply. The principal socioeconomic&#13;
factors responsible are reduced infant and child mortality and basic&#13;
education, particularly among girls.&#13;
1/ For Kerala, the partial regression was +1.07 months: an increase of&#13;
one year in female education raised the age at marriage by 1.07 months.&#13;

Kerala differs from the othe: States of India in msny reopects, but&#13;
most notably in the case of health conditions and education. It, would&#13;
appear, therefore, that in order to encourage an increase i1n ege zt merrixge&#13;
and small family norms in the other Statees, mesures should firot bs taken to&#13;
reduce infant and child mortality and increase female education. 7Lke&#13;
increasing the age at marriage, these are well-knoun andot'epaated policy&#13;
recommendations supported by most studies on the determinants of fertility0&#13;
The present study adds one more to the List0    et also suggcsts how these pol"&#13;
icies might be implemented, particularly among the pooro&#13;
One way to improve the health and educational level of 3.ow-income&#13;
families is to provide them ths means to earn core and thus be i1 a position&#13;
to buy better health and education. Kerala points to en alternate way of&#13;
achieving these goals -° reduce the cost of these servsces and mase them&#13;
accessible to low-income families through a cheep transportatlcn netnwork0&#13;
These are direct means of intervention to improve the level of education and&#13;
health of lou-income families. And the expsrlence of Kerale shows that it&#13;
will work0&#13;
Agrarian reforms including establishment of minimum wageo, better&#13;
working conditions, and land ceilings seem to have helped increace both the&#13;
desire for smaller families and the demand for birth control in Nerala.&#13;
thather these redistribution policies can be implemented in the other States&#13;

same level of family planning services as in other States has been more&#13;
effective in Kerala because of the different socioeconomic conditions,&#13;
especially lower mortality and higher female literacy.&#13;
Yet Kerala women do not have a very clear idea about the number of&#13;
children they would like to have; this number is determined mainly by the&#13;
number of children they already have. Even when women find that they have&#13;
reached or exceeded their desired number of children (as reported by them),&#13;
not all of them take steps to prevent additional births.&#13;
It is, therefore, neither a strong manifest demand for family&#13;
planning services nor a strong desire for fewer children, but rather an&#13;
effective delivery of family planning services aided by financial incentives,&#13;
in conjunction with a weak dormant demand, that has made family planning&#13;
acceptance as high as it is in Kerala.&#13;
A basic question that we cannot adequately answer is whether the&#13;
family planning program in Kerala would have worked as well if the population&#13;
were like that of the rest of India with respect to education, health, and so&#13;
on. We do, however, have several clues to the answer. First, in Kerala a&#13;
high economic status is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for&#13;
acceptance of birth control methods. A strong family planning program like&#13;
Kerala's (with financial incentives and emphasis on sterilization) can alter&#13;
the normal relationship between fertility decline and socioeconomic status.&#13;
Economic incentives are valued most by the poor, and hence, their family&#13;
planning acceptance rate and fertility decline can be -- and in the case of&#13;
Kerala are -- greater than those of the higher classes. Second, a strong&#13;
family planning program can be bolstered by socioeconomic development&#13;
efforts. The interdistrict comparisons derived from our survey show this&#13;
pattern. Alleppey and Ernakulam districts are more advanced than Palghat,&#13;
and the family planning acceptance rates are much lower in the latter&#13;
district. In general there is a positive association between socioeconomic&#13;
development and family planning acceptance. But the experience in other&#13;
districts in India shows no similar relationship. The Kerala survey&#13;
indicates that this association can be broken with suitable family planning&#13;
delivery. Without the State's socioeconomic development, the family planning&#13;
program would have succeeded to some extent, but the impact on fertility&#13;
would have been less.&#13;
Finally, there are some lessons to be learned regarding future&#13;
research on fertility declines in Kerala and elsewhere.&#13;
We began our study by hypothesizing that changes in Kerala's&#13;
fertility were caused by increases in the age at marriage among all segments&#13;
of the population and by increases in family planning usage among the middle&#13;
class and the well-to-do. We therefore attempted to collect data that would&#13;
throw light on the socioeconomic determinants of contraceptive behavior and&#13;
of age at marriage.&#13;
Some of our original hypotheses were supported by the survey data,&#13;
but others were contradicted by them. As a result, some of the data&#13;
collected in the survey were not as useful as we had originally anticipated,&#13;
while other data that would have been very useful were not collected at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
The survey was designed in line with the assumption that the Kerala&#13;
population is fairly homogeneous with respect to the determinants of&#13;
fertility.  Only three districts, which were not selected at random, were&#13;
covered. The pace of fertility decline and the factors related to this&#13;
decline proved, however, to be somewhat different in the Malabar districts&#13;
(Palghat) than in those of Cochin (Ernakulam) and Travancore (Alleppey). A&#13;
better basis for the sample population would have been a random selection of&#13;
households from the entire State. The Muslim/non-Muslim comparison, for&#13;
example, would have been very different if the sample had been selected this&#13;
way.&#13;
The theoretical framework used to explain fertility decline depends&#13;
heavily on the hypothesis of a relative increase in the cost-benefit ratio of&#13;
children. At the time of the field survey, not enough emphasis was given to&#13;
collecting information on factors related to either the costs or the&#13;
benefits. Moreover, we assumed that in Kerala children are not employed&#13;
outside the home, and that education is completely free. The survey showed,&#13;
however, that 38 percent of children above the age of twelve have worked for&#13;
wages, and that 96 percent of them gave their wages to the family.&#13;
Similarly, although education is free to a great extent, the proportion of&#13;
family income which parents spend on their children's education has&#13;
increased. In future studies on the determinants of fertility, it would be&#13;
very useful to collect information on the cost of children's education; the&#13;
cost of children's medical care; children's economic activity; children's&#13;
contributions to family income; and parents' dependence on their children&#13;
during their old age for housing, subsistence, companionship, and other&#13;
assistance. To obtain these data, it will be necessary to interview not only&#13;
married women 15-49 years old and their husbands, but also older men and&#13;
women.&#13;
A second factor which we would like to have studied more thoroughly&#13;
is the change in the opportunity cost of mothers. How much did the rise in&#13;
wages, increased employment opportunities, and improved working conditions&#13;
for women matter to an individual and influence her preference for small&#13;
families and her adoption of contraception?&#13;
Our attempts to explain fertility differences as well as the use or&#13;
nonuse of contraceptives were only partially successful. Much more needs to&#13;
be done in identifying relevant variables to explain differences among women&#13;
and couples. The total variance in the use of family planning methods&#13;
explained by socioeconomic factors was relatively small (less than 16&#13;
percent). The study attributed this low explanatory power of the model to&#13;
the absence of program-related factors among the independent variables.&#13;
Indeed, one of the major conclusions of this study is that the family&#13;
planning program has an independent causal effect on desire for small&#13;
families and acceptance of contraceptives. Inclusion of program-related&#13;
variables such as access to family planning services, quality of services,&#13;
intensity of motivational efforts, satisfaction with methods offered,&#13;
community-level variables, and incentives and disincentives would have&#13;
provided important data. Future studies on the determinants of fertility&#13;
should try to collect information on these program-related variables either&#13;
at the couple level or at the community level, and should include program&#13;
effects in the models for explaining why individual couples do or do not&#13;
choose to practice contraception.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
A similar situation arose with respect to the determinants of infant&#13;
and child mortality. The total variance explained by socioeconomic and&#13;
demographic variables was very small. In this case, also, the reason for the&#13;
low explanatory power of the regression model could be the absence of health&#13;
service-related variables. The study did not collect information on maternal&#13;
and child health (MCH) practices of women or on access to and utilization of&#13;
health and medical services. In a situation like Kerala's where government&#13;
medical services are relatively free and transportation cheap, variables&#13;
related to the utilization of MCH and other medical services are perhaps more&#13;
important than socioeconomic factors in explaining why a particular child&#13;
dies in infancy and another survives.&#13;
Finally, this study placed particular emphasis on explaining the&#13;
determinants of female age at marriage. Some very useful data were collected&#13;
from married and unmarried women, as well as from married and unmarried men.&#13;
In this respect, the present study is the first of its kind for Kerala. But&#13;
it treated the age at marriage of girls as independent of the age at marriage&#13;
of boys. This was a mistake. In the Kerala context, the age at marriage of&#13;
a girl is determined not only by the socioeconomic characteristics of the&#13;
girl and her family, but equally -- if not more so -- by socioeconomic and&#13;
other factors related to the age at marriage of boys. If, for whatever&#13;
reason, boys postpone their marriages to age 28 or 30, this will have a&#13;
repercussion on the age at marriage of girls, irrespective of their desire to&#13;
marry earlier or later. Thus, the factors that determine the age at marriage&#13;
of boys are important determinants of the age at marriage of girls as well.&#13;
In future studies, this linkage should be explicitly taken into&#13;
consideration.&#13;

            Anomaly of the fertility decline in
            India's Kerala state : a field investigation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Kerala does not conform to the
            socioeconomic development pattern normally associated with a
            rapid fertility decline. This report attempts to determine
            the causes of the decline that Kerala is experiencing. Given
            that the background description is not inaccurate, attention
            is focused upon social, cultural, and political
            characteristics that may be relevant. Three of these seem
            more important than others: land reform, political
            awareness, and education. Extensive land reform has not only
            redistibuted the wealth, but has also contributed to the
            decline of the matriarchal systems; every aspect of life in
            Kerala is politicized, facilitating better delivery of
            government services; and high educational attainment has
            been accompanied by high unemployment among the educated.
            All these factors seem to have had an effect on the
            declining fertility rate; family planning programs seem to
            have been insignificant.
