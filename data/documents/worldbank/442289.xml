I. ECONOMIC SETTING&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1   The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), comprises Antigua and&#13;
Barbuda, the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia,&#13;
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Montserrat, which is not a member of the World&#13;
Bank. The OECS was formed in 1968 as a common market which falls within the&#13;
Caribbean Community (CARICOM) - a larger 12-country regional organization. The&#13;
OECS countries share a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$) and a&#13;
central bank. The EC dollar has been pegged to the US dollar at an exchange rate of&#13;
EC$2.70 to one US dollar since 1976.&#13;
1.2   The climate of each of the countries is tropical with average temperatures&#13;
ranging from 23 degree C in winter to 32 degree C in summer, and cooler&#13;
temperatures at higher elevations. Some of the countries experience a rainy season&#13;
extending from May to November. The geography of the countries is somewhat&#13;
similar; Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts are relatively flat with sandy soil&#13;
overlying bedrock; the countries of Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the&#13;
Grenadines and Nevis are mostly rugged and of volcanic in origin with fertile soil and&#13;
extensive forest coverage; and Grenada, which is comprised of a main island with a&#13;
number of smaller islands and islets, has a combination of flat plains, mountainous&#13;
interiors and dense forests. The combined total land area of these countries is less&#13;
than 3,000 sq. km.&#13;
1.3    All of the countries are small, with fragile ecosystems and relatively low&#13;
overall population densities as a result of the mountainous nature of much of the&#13;
countries. In 1991 the total combined population of the countries was enumerated at&#13;
just over 500,000, approximately half of which (the exception being St. Vincent and&#13;
the Grenadines) live in urban settlements. 1993 GNP per capita ranges from&#13;
US$2,130 in St.Vincent and the Grenadines to US$6,390 in Antigua and Barbuda&#13;
(Table 1.1).&#13;
1.4   Development in the OECS countries has taken place on a limited and fragile&#13;
economic base. In addition to being prone to repeated natural disasters (hurricanes),&#13;
their highly open economies make them vulnerable to external vicissitudes, with a&#13;
large share of their exports, which is of agricultural origin (bananas and sugar),&#13;
dependent on preferential market arrangements. Overall, the economies have&#13;
performed well in recent years, however, collectively reaching an average rate of&#13;
growth of about 5% per annum between 1980 and 1990, slowing down to about 2%&#13;
per annum during the early 1990s. The combined 1993 Gross Domestic Product&#13;
(GNP) for all of the islands was estimated at US$1.3 billion with the service industry&#13;
accounting for over 60%, and the tourist industry contributing heavily to that sector.&#13;
The industrial and agricultural sectors together account for the remainder, with&#13;
industry accounting for a slightly higher contribution to GDP.&#13;

B. Environmental Linkages to Economic Development&#13;
1.5    Although the environmental problems are not overwhelming in the OECS&#13;
countries, the linkages between development and the environment are nowhere more&#13;
evident than in these countries. The inter-related problems of population pressure and&#13;
land scarcity have led to an over-exploitation of natural resources. Forests have been&#13;
relentlessly cultivated for subsistence, commercial agriculture and logging, while the&#13;
islands' skewed land ownership and complex land tenure arrangements have given rise&#13;
to over-utilization of marginal lands. The consequences have been accelerated soil&#13;
erosion, land slides, increased flooding during rainy periods, reduced water supplies&#13;
during dry periods, deterioration in water quality, sedimentation of rivers and coastal&#13;
areas, and consequent threat to mangroves, sea-grass beds and coral reefs.&#13;
Concurrently, increasing levels of domestic consumption, coupled with additional&#13;
numbers of tourists and cruise ship passengers, are responsible for generating&#13;
increasing quantities of solid and liquid waste. The inadequate existing facilities for&#13;
the collection, treatment and disposal of these wastes means that much of it ends up in&#13;
informal dumps, watercourses or the sea.&#13;
1.6   To safeguard public health, the quality of their environment and thus&#13;
protecting their tourism base in particular, the countries are increasingly interested in&#13;
undertaking policies and programs to protect the environment. These concerns focus&#13;
on: (a) improvement in waste management; (b) attention to land overuse, including&#13;
deforestation; (c) reversal of coastal degradation; and (d) attention to water pollution.&#13;
1.7   The current state of natural resource degradation, particularly of coastal and&#13;
marine resources, poses a serious threat to the sustainability of local economies which&#13;
are largely dependent on tourism and fishing, in addition to agriculture. To address&#13;
these issues, the governments are committed to: (a) change economic policies so as to&#13;
provide incentives to encourage conservation, (b) introduce cost recovery for&#13;
environmental protection and user fees for national parks, (c) divest public lands and&#13;
introduce land titling, (d) increase public awareness through education, (e) improve&#13;
the legal and regulatory framework, (f) strengthen environmental monitoring and&#13;
enforcement mechanisms, and (g) invest in waste disposal facilities.&#13;
II. SECTORAL PERSPECTIVE&#13;
A. The Port Sector&#13;
2.1    There are a total of 10 main ports in the OECS countries, with another 29&#13;
secondary ports which are made up mostly of small craft harbors, small fishing ports&#13;
and major yacht anchorages. There is little information on the annual traffic of these&#13;
ports, with most of the cargo being break-bulk, mainly agricultural goods for export,&#13;
with some container activity. Table 2.1 indicates the location of the main ports and&#13;
small crafts harbors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
2.2   In addition to freight traffic, there is also an increasing volume of passenger&#13;
traffic to these islands. This traffic is particularly important as it directly impacts on&#13;
the tourist industry which in most of the countries is the main economic growth&#13;
sector. Table 2.2 presents stayover tourist and ship passenger traffic by country.&#13;
Most cruise-ship traffic originates from the US and is composed of passengers&#13;
travelling both on holiday cruise liners (89%), and on private yachts (9%). The&#13;
balance of 2% arrives by cargo vessel (Paras.6.3 and Table 6.1 in Section 6). While&#13;
many islands have seen a major increase in tourist arrivals overall, the biggest&#13;
increases have occurred in the cruise ship industry, where passenger arrivals have&#13;
substantially increased in the period 1986-92. Stayover tourist arrivals have also&#13;
increased, but not as dramatically. The result is: (a) port congestion, where the ports&#13;
of St. John's in Antigua, Castries in St. Lucia, and St. George's in Grenada&#13;
frequently have as many as 6 cruise ships in port at any one time, either alongside&#13;
dedicated cruise ship berths or general cargo berths, or lying at anchor in the harbor;&#13;
and (b) an associated increase in tourist and passenger generated waste, either in the&#13;
islands or on the way to the islands.&#13;

B. Environmental Issues associated with Domestic&#13;
and Ship Waste Disposal Facilities&#13;
2.3   Among all of the environmental issues facing the OECS countries, addressing&#13;
the related issues of ineffective liquid and solid waste management and coastal and&#13;
marine resource degradation, are of top priority. These problems pose a threat to&#13;
public health, the environmental quality of the islands, and to the future of the&#13;
islands' principal income and employment generating activity; i.e. tourism. Solid&#13;
waste management conditions and practices in each of the countries are similar in&#13;
many ways, with some of the main similarities comprising the following:&#13;
in all countries, except Antigua, a significant proportion of the population is&#13;
not served by any type of waste collection system;&#13;
there is little public understanding of the public health, environmental, tourism&#13;
or economic implications of inadequate waste management systems;&#13;
the capacity of all countries to improve waste management systems is severely&#13;
constrained by the existing institutional framework, most particularly at the&#13;
technical and financial level;&#13;
existing infrastructure in all countries is under-capitalized and poorly&#13;
maintained and operated;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
controls on the management of international wastes entering the countries are&#13;
either non-existent or totally ineffective;&#13;
2.4    There are a number of types of solid waste generated in each of the OECS&#13;
countries. The major types of waste are: (a) residential waste generation, estimated at&#13;
about 0.58 kg/person/day in urban areas and 0.52 kg/person/day outside major urban&#13;
and economic centers; (b) industrial, commercial and institutional waste generation,&#13;
estimated at the equivalent of about 0.45 kg/person/day in urban areas and 0.27&#13;
kg/person/day outside of major urban and economic centers; (c) stayover tourist solid&#13;
waste, estimated to be double residential waste generation on a per capita basis, and&#13;
equal to about 1.16 kg/tourist population equivalent/day; (d) ship-generated waste,&#13;
with estimates varying widely depending not only on the number of passengers but&#13;
also on the type of vessel and length of the voyage, but estimated at 2.95&#13;
kg/person/day for cruise-ships, 2.3 kg/person/day on merchant vessels and 1.6&#13;
kg/person/day on yachts; and (f) special wastes, such as hospital wastes generated in&#13;
small amounts but which require special handling.&#13;
2.5    For domestically-generated waste, collection systems vary widely in their&#13;
coverage and efficiency but are inadequate in all countries. In most cases a&#13;
combination of curb-side and communal skip collection is provided at frequencies&#13;
varying from daily to weekly. System coverage varies from an estimated 85 % in&#13;
Antigua to less than 50% in Dominica and Grenada where many areas remain&#13;
unserved. The other OECS countries manage a collection efficiency of about 60-70%.&#13;
The main problems facing all countries in achieving efficient and environmentally&#13;
appropriate disposal of solid waste include: (a) lack of capacity at existing landfill&#13;
sites; (b) poor sanitary conditions at landfill sites; (c) indiscriminate burning of waste&#13;
at these sites; (d) visual and odor problems; (e) pollution of ground and surface&#13;
waters through leachate migration; (f) poor accessibility and management of sites; (g)&#13;
indiscriminate on-site dumping; and (h) inadequate and poorly operated and&#13;
maintained compaction and other landfill equipment.&#13;
2.6   In addition to solid wastes generated on the islands, waste discharges from&#13;
ships and yachts add significantly to the problems. While some countries refuse to&#13;
receive solid waste from ships, in all cases some ship-generated waste is already&#13;
being deposited, with or without the knowledge of the government. It is the ship's&#13;
agents who generally hire private haulage contractors to carry out this activity for&#13;
large vessels. For yachts, private individuals frequently offer to remove solid wastes&#13;
which is then disposed of indiscriminately elsewhere on the coastline. While port&#13;
authorities are mandated to take temporary custody of cargoes in transit if ships are&#13;
found to be in violation of the MARPOL 73/78 Convention (Annex V) this is never&#13;
carried out, nor do the governments have the facilities to do so. Presently, these&#13;
same port authorities are not directly involved in ship-generated waste disposal or&#13;
treatment since none of the ports have solid waste reception or treatment facilities on&#13;
their premises, and they have no capability to deal directly with these wastes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Furtherrnore, the difficulty of predicting ship and yacht arrivals and in estimating the&#13;
volumes of waste generated per passenger, and days spent at sea prior to landing&#13;
waste, make accurate projections of ship-generated waste to be handled by each port&#13;
difficult to develop. Based on information which is available, calculations show&#13;
volumes of ship-generated waste which could be landed at between about four and 18&#13;
percent of domestic waste generation in the countries. This excludes food waste,&#13;
which under the MARPOL convention can be ground up and disposed of at sea&#13;
beyond certain limits and under particular conditions.&#13;
C. The MARPOL Convention&#13;
2.7   The MARPOL 73/78 Convention currently has five Annexes, one of which&#13;
(Annex V) provides a regulatory framework for the prevention of pollution of&#13;
international waters by solid waste from ships. This Annex became effective on&#13;
December 31, 1988.&#13;
2.8   In 1991, at the Marine Environment protection Committee Meeting in London&#13;
(MEPC 31), a proposal to adopt the Wider Caribbean as a Special Area under Annex&#13;
V was approved. The 37 territories and 28 states which make up the Wider Caribbean&#13;
were asked to endeavor to provide adequate acceptable reception facilities for Annex&#13;
V wastes at all ports and harbors receiving international shipping. The rationale for&#13;
declaring the Wider Caribbean as a Special Area for just Annex V of MARPOL&#13;
73/78 stemmed from the fact that pollution from marine garbage, largely emanating&#13;
from cruise ships, was considered to be of the highest priority. Furthermnore, since a&#13;
significant proportion of marine debris is contributed by land-based sources, the ship-&#13;
generated solid waste initiative was seen to be an opportunity for these countries to&#13;
concurrently address the problems of both shore-based and ship-generated waste.&#13;
2.9   The regulations governing provision of reception facilities within Special Areas&#13;
state that Governments must undertake to provide adequate reception facilities for&#13;
solid waste at all ports within a special area, taking into account the special needs of&#13;
ships operating in such areas.&#13;
2.10 In addition to MARPOL 73/78 Annex V waste, Annex I (which deals with oily&#13;
waste), and Annex II (which deals with chemical waste) are also mandatory under the&#13;
provisions of MARPOL 73/78. However, these wastes impact upon few ports in the&#13;
region. Annex A attached hereto provides a more detailed explanation of the history&#13;
and implications of MARPOL 73/78, and the Special Area designation of the Wider&#13;
Caribbean.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
D. The Legislative and Institutional Framework&#13;
and the OECS Secretariat&#13;
2.11  Within the OECS Secretariat there are two units which concern themselves&#13;
with environmental issues; the Natural Resources Management Unit (NRMU) and the&#13;
Legal Unit (LU). Outside of the Secretariat there is also the Caribbean&#13;
Environmental Health Institute (CEHI) which has a Caribbean wide remit in the&#13;
sector.&#13;
2.12 The NRMU was formed in 1986 with a mandate to: coordinate regional&#13;
environmental programs and activities on behalf of the OECS Secretariat; provide&#13;
technical assistance and support to the OECS member countries; and promote&#13;
cooperation among OECS countries in environmental management. Although its role&#13;
does not include direct project management, the NRMU has been used as a focus for&#13;
project management units, and has been involved in the successful implementation of&#13;
two major donor funded programs: a GTZ financed cooperation program in natural&#13;
resource management; and the USAID funded Environment and Coastal Resource&#13;
(ENCORE) Project. It has also been involved in other projects with UNDP and other&#13;
agencies, and with the project preparation phase for this project - the OECS Solid&#13;
Waste Management Project. The Unit is guided by a Technical Advisory Committee&#13;
of senior environmentalists and planners from the OECS member states. NRMU with&#13;
GTZ support, is able to provide advice to member countries on an ad hoc basis,&#13;
including issues concerning solid waste management. The LU is involved in a&#13;
number of matters relating to the development and harmonization of legislation, and&#13;
provides legal services and advice to the OECS member states. The Unit reports to&#13;
the OECS Legal Affairs Committee, comprised of the OECS Attorneys-General. The&#13;
LU maintains close contact with the OECS countries' Foreign Affairs Committees&#13;
which would be responsible for MARPOL 73/78 implementation. Both the NRMU&#13;
and LU report directly to the OECS Authority.&#13;
2.13 The CEHI, which was established in 1981, deals primarily with the coastal&#13;
marine environment, and particularly monitoring standards, in CARICOM member&#13;
countries. It has been involved in a series of technical assistance packages to the&#13;
OECS countries on matters relating to solid waste management.&#13;
2.14  Within the OECS countries themselves, responsibility for environmental&#13;
management in general and waste management in particular is distributed among a&#13;
number of agencies. These agencies are characterized by uneven technical and&#13;
managerial capabilities and poor coordination. In all countries the ultimate&#13;
responsibility for solid waste collection, treatment and disposal falls under the&#13;
Ministries of Health. However, at the executive level, responsibilities are frequently&#13;
shared by other ministries (Ministry of Works and Communications), and/or local&#13;
governments. At the local level, these authorities are uniformnly technically and&#13;
managerially weak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
2.15   In the case of ship-generated waste, while port authorities are responsible for&#13;
port operations, waste management is invariably handled by private contractors hired&#13;
by the ship's agents. As a result, waste landed is often taken from the port and&#13;
dumped either at solid waste disposal sites or elsewhere without any monitoring or&#13;
supervision by government authorities.&#13;
2.16   Legislation relating to solid waste management is patchy and there is little in&#13;
the way of waste management policy. In a number of countries legislation is in place,&#13;
but enforcement is weak. (Annexes B-G include descriptions of the legislative&#13;
environment in each country). The main institutional constraints to improved waste&#13;
management may be summarized as follows: (a) limited absorptive capacity of&#13;
existing institutions; (b) lack of financial control and accountability; (c) inadequate or&#13;
ineffective legislative instruments; (d) technical and managerial weakness; and (e)&#13;
inefficient and poorly defined administrative responsibilities.&#13;
2.17  It is apparent that the OECS countries face numerous challenges in the&#13;
implementation of a solid waste management strategy. Some of the more problematic&#13;
include:&#13;
Historically, the OECS countries have tended to approach waste&#13;
management problems and solutions separately, with little&#13;
communication or interaction among themselves. Systems have&#13;
therefore developed to best suit individual characteristics of each&#13;
country with little regard to the potential benefits of a more regional&#13;
approach, which could inter alia share resources and expertise in&#13;
resolving waste management and other environmental problems.&#13;
Awareness of waste management issues and waste diversion&#13;
opportunities is rather poor in the majority of these countries. In&#13;
general, domestic waste management is considered entirely the&#13;
responsibility of government, not of the individual. Furthermore,&#13;
industry waste generation is rarely considered part of the production&#13;
process and cost, and consequently, is treated as an externality.&#13;
The OECS countries have small populations that tend to be&#13;
concentrated in a number of urban areas that are disbursed throughout&#13;
each country - frequently around the coasts. Collectively they are&#13;
situated at considerable distances from international markets, which&#13;
makes it particularly difficult to develop recycling options, not only&#13;
because of access and transportation problems, but also as a result of&#13;
poor awareness of waste diversion needs and opportunities.&#13;
&#13;

E. Bank Experience with Previous Lending&#13;
2.18  Over the period FY82-89, the OECS countries directly received seven (7) IDA&#13;
credits totalling US$30.0 million. These included: three operations in Dominica for a&#13;
total of US$11.0 million [Road Rehabilitation (FY82), Hydropower (FY87), and&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit (FY87)]; two in St. Vincent and the Grenadines totaling&#13;
US$8.0 million [Hydropower (FY84) and Agricultural Rehabilitation (FY89)]; one in&#13;
Grenada for US$5.0 million for Agricultural Rehabilitation and Crop Diversification&#13;
(FY85); and CDB IV, Regional Technical Vocational project (FY87). During FY88-&#13;
90 some of the countries were considered eligible for a limited amount of IBRD&#13;
lending. A total of four projects were approved during this period; an Agricultural&#13;
Diversification and Rehabilitation Project in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (FY89); a&#13;
Water Supply Project in St. Lucia (FY90); an Agricultural Diversification and&#13;
Rehabilitation Project in St. Kitts and Nevis (FY90); and two global lines of credit&#13;
(CDB V - FY90) and (CDB VI - FY 94). Overall, project implementation in the&#13;
OECS countries has been satisfactory. The Regional Technical Vocational Education&#13;
Project faced procurement and design problems while the Dominica SAC third tranche&#13;
release was substantially delayed as public finances deteriorated due to wage increases&#13;
granted by the Government.&#13;
2.19 GEF operations in the OECS member countries and the Caribbean region&#13;
includes the Wider Caribbean Initiative for Ship-Generated Waste (approved in FY94)&#13;
and a global warming technical assistance project for CARICOM countries planned&#13;
for FY96. IFC's involvement in the OECS countries has included: (a) US$3.2 million&#13;
co-financing for the Club St. Lucia in St. Lucia (FY91); (b) US$0.7 million toward&#13;
the financing of the Fort Young Ltd. Hotel in Dominica (FY89); and US$2.3 million&#13;
toward the financing of a hotel project for Issa Nicholas Ltd. in Grenada (FY86).&#13;
2.20 In the medium term, the Bank intends to support a program of economic&#13;
diversification and human resources development within a stable macroeconomic&#13;
framework. The Bank will increase its focus on aid coordination and policy advice.&#13;
There will also be increased attention given to environmental issues.&#13;
2.21  Future Bank lending in the OECS countries will be channeled mostly through&#13;
the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and through regional projects. An&#13;
agreement has been reached with the CDB covering lending, economic and sector&#13;
work programs. In addition to the proposed Waste Management Project, the Bank is&#13;
also preparing a Regional Education Project aimed at improving access to basic&#13;
education and a Sewerage and Sewage Treatment Project which will be channelled&#13;
through CDB.&#13;
2.22  The proposed project is the first such operation in the sector in the OECS&#13;
countries. It represents a considerable challenge to prepare, negotiate, coordinate,&#13;
and implement. However, lessons from other single country experiences in the sector&#13;
have been applied, notably the China Ship Waste Disposal Project (SAR No. 9852-&#13;
&#13;

Project.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale for the Bank's Involvement&#13;
3.1   The rationale for Bank involvement in the proposed project concerns its role as&#13;
catalyst in bringing together the six OECS countries to jointly address one of the most&#13;
urgent environmental problems facing them, that is the contamination of their&#13;
terrestrial environments and pollution of their coastal zones and the Caribbean Sea.&#13;
The Bank is working closely with the OECS governments, regional agencies and other&#13;
international agencies to assist the OECS countries in developing a coordinated&#13;
regional environmental strategy supported by action plans at both the regional and&#13;
national levels. To this end, the Bank has been successful in mobilizing incremental&#13;
funding for this operation through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF),&#13;
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the&#13;
European Union (EU). (paras.3.11 and 3.12 and Table 3.2.)&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.2   The proposed project is to be the first in a series of environmentally-oriented&#13;
activities which will ensure the future maintenance of environmental quality in the&#13;
OECS countries. The objective of this operation is to reduce public health risks and&#13;
protect the environmental integrity of the islands and their coastal and marine&#13;
systems, by improving domestic solid waste management facilities and facilitating&#13;
compliance with the "Special Area" designation of the Caribbean Sea for MARPOL&#13;
73/78 Annex V wastes. The Project will reduce terrestrial and marine pollution in this&#13;
area through avoiding and discouraging indiscriminate disposal of solid waste both on&#13;
and off shore. A further objective is to significantly enhance public health and&#13;
environmental quality by strengthening the countries' capacities to effectively manage&#13;
and dispose of solid waste in an environmentally sustainable manner. More&#13;
specifically, project objectives are to assist the OECS governments to: (a) improve the&#13;
coverage and effectiveness of domestic solid waste collection and disposal facilities;&#13;
(b) reduce pollution of international and territorial waters caused by ship-generated&#13;
solid wastes; (c) improve the collection, treatment and disposal of ship-generated solid&#13;
wastes; (d) assist the beneficiary countries in the establishment of appropriate legal&#13;
and institutional frameworks to enable effective management and disposal of shore&#13;
and ship-generated waste; (e) assist in the preparation of plans and programs to&#13;
address the problems of collection, treatment and disposal of liquid wastes; and (f)&#13;
identify Regional opportunities for reduction, recovery and recycling of solid waste.&#13;
3.3   The above objectives, which focus on increasing the level of environmental&#13;
protection and improving environmental conditions, will be achieved by:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
(a)   institutional strengthening and improved policy, regulatory and&#13;
incentive frameworks to manage solid waste;&#13;
(b)   addressing critical deficiencies in the domestic solid waste collection,&#13;
treatment and disposal sectors;&#13;
(c)   provision of suitable reception, collection, handling, treatment and&#13;
disposal facilities for ship-generated waste;&#13;
(d)   enhancing the opportunities for waste recovery and recycling;&#13;
(e)   encouraging improved cost recovery for solid waste management&#13;
services;&#13;
(f)   establishing a regional policy and institutional framework for fostering&#13;
collaboration among the OECS islands inter alia on cost recovery for&#13;
disposal of ship-generated waste;&#13;
(g)   providing technical assistance for liquid waste collection, treatment and&#13;
disposal systems in the OECS countries; and&#13;
(h)   encourage greater coordination between the OECS countries and donor&#13;
cormmunity in the provision of environmental assistance.&#13;
3.4   It is envisaged that the regional framework adopted in establishing the project,&#13;
and the regional component proposed as part of the project, will encourage greater&#13;
coordination between the OECS countries and donor community in the provision of&#13;
enviromnental assistance. The regional approach is particularly important in view of&#13;
the commonality of many of the problems and issues faced by the OECS countries.&#13;
This approach should assist in the development of strategies required to mitigate&#13;
further environmental problems in the future.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.5   The proposed project comprises a number of national components, which are&#13;
similar for each of the OECS countries, and a regional component which covers&#13;
issues common to all.&#13;
National Components&#13;
3.6   The National Components comprise the following three major elements:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
(a)    The introduction of solid waste management improvements and&#13;
investments in each of the six countries the purpose of which will be to address the&#13;
major deficiencies in the sector by financing improvements to the existing solid waste&#13;
storage; collection; and disposal systems through the purchase of collection and other&#13;
equipment and the development of appropriate disposal facilities.&#13;
(b)   Investments in port reception facilities in all six countries to address&#13;
the problem of ship-generated solid (MARPOL 73/78 Annex V) waste which is&#13;
currently dumped in coastal zones and international waters around the OECS&#13;
countries. It will include the provision of convenient receptacles at all ports, harbors,&#13;
marinas and major anchorages, and where necessary specialized equipment (eg.&#13;
barges) to facilitate the off-loading of the ship-generated solid waste; the equipment&#13;
necessary to treat this waste at the port or the point of final disposal; and, the&#13;
equipment necessary to transport the waste to the ultimate disposal site.&#13;
(c)    The rationalization of the existing institutional framework in all six&#13;
countries through the creation and development of solid waste management entities to&#13;
improve management and control of solid waste and improve cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms for the services provided.&#13;
3.7    The basic composition of activities in this category will include the&#13;
rationalization of existing collection and disposal facilities and conversion of existing&#13;
dumps into sanitary landfill sites or development of new sanitary landfill sites;&#13;
provision of facilities for the treatment of medical and other hazardous wastes; and&#13;
the introduction of measures to encourage recovery of recyclable items from solid&#13;
waste, including the setting up of "buy-back" depots and development of a set of&#13;
incentives to help achieve this recycling objective. Specifically, the project&#13;
components include:&#13;
(a)    provision of storage facilities (bins, dumpsters or skips) to augment the&#13;
existing system for storage of domestically generated waste, particularly&#13;
where curb-side collection systems are operated;&#13;
(b)   procurement of collection and transportation equipment to augment the&#13;
existing systems for the collection of solid waste and its transportation&#13;
to the point of ultimate disposal;&#13;
(c)    provision of collection and storage facilities for the reception of ship-&#13;
generated wastes at large ports, small craft harbors and anchorages&#13;
from cruise ships, cargo vessels and small crafts including yachts; and&#13;
procurement of equipment to facilitate transport of this waste to the site&#13;
of final disposal, or to a point where the waste can be collected for&#13;
eventual disposal (including barges);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(d)   provision of equipment to support efforts at extending opportunities for&#13;
waste recovery and recycling (including processing of recyclable&#13;
materials and composting);&#13;
(e)   construction of transfer stations for solid waste (in two countries only -&#13;
Grenada and Dominica only), and the procurement of transfer&#13;
equipment;&#13;
(f)   development of new sanitary landfill sites for the disposal of solid&#13;
waste or the upgrading of existing dump sites to sanitary landfill&#13;
facilities and the closure, redemption and reclamation of unsuitable and&#13;
inappropriate existing dump sites;&#13;
(g)   procurement of compaction and other operational equipment necessary&#13;
to assist in the correct management of solid waste at the new sanitary&#13;
landfill sites, and to increase landfill lifetime and maintain site&#13;
operation in a satisfactory condition;&#13;
(h)   procurement of equipment for the effective treatment of hospital wastes&#13;
(in three countries only - Antigua and Barbuda, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and&#13;
Nevis only);&#13;
(i)    procurement of equipment to assist in the monitoring and operation of&#13;
the improved solid waste management system; and&#13;
(j)   assistance with the establishment of a sanctuary for the threatened&#13;
Grenada Dove (using GET funds in Grenada only).&#13;
Regional Components&#13;
3.8   The Regional Components will focus on two specific areas as follows:&#13;
(a)   Technical assistance for the preparation of sewerage masterplans and of&#13;
a program of immediate action priority sewerage and sewage treatment projects in all&#13;
six countries, and the development of detailed project proposals in these sectors in at&#13;
least three of the countries. The technical assistance component will also include&#13;
training, education and public awareness programs in solid waste management and&#13;
will help to develop regional approaches to such issues as environmental legislation,&#13;
and to ensure that the full potential benefits of the project are realized.&#13;
(b)   Preparation of a workable institutional framework for regional&#13;
coordination in the project sectors and to facilitate overall management and&#13;
monitoring of the Project. Institutional strengthening and training will be focused both&#13;
at the regional and national levels. The scope and scale of these activities at the&#13;
regional level are designed to dovetail with those initiated through the USAID funded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
ENCORE project and GTZ supported projects which are addressing related areas of&#13;
concern. The project would finance a number of activities to be coordinated through&#13;
the OECS Secretariat, including: fostering cooperation among member countries on&#13;
coordinated environmental policies, strategies and action plans; provision of a&#13;
consultation mechanism for the formulation, strengthening and harmonization of&#13;
environmental legislation and regulations and for their enforcement; investigation and&#13;
negotiation of regional markets for compost and recyclable materials; preparation of&#13;
documentation for the management and monitoring of ship waste; organization of&#13;
annual regional waste management workshops and seminars on relevant topics (e.g.&#13;
management of hazardous cargoes at ports, recycling, etc.); and provision of technical&#13;
assistance to national agencies during implementation of the project.&#13;
3.9   A full description of the project components for each of the countries is&#13;
provided at Annexes B to G. The TOR for the proposed sewerage masterplan and&#13;
project preparation component is provided at Annex H. The port reception facilities&#13;
proposed for each country are described at Annex I, and a full description of the&#13;
elements of the proposed regional component is outlined at Annex J.&#13;
D. Project Cost Estimates and Financing Plan&#13;
Cost Estimates&#13;
3.10  The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$50.5 million including $9.5&#13;
million for taxes, duties and land. The foreign exchange component totals about&#13;
US$32.7 million. These costs include provision for design and supervision, physical&#13;
and price contingencies at standard rates. The basic breakdown of project financing&#13;
by component is indicated in Tables 3.1 a and 3. lb and in Annexes B to G for each of&#13;
the countries individually.&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
3.11  Based on estimated project costs and the overall financing split which has been&#13;
agreed to between the Bank, the EU, the EIB, and CDB, the Table 3.2 provides a&#13;
summary of the financing plan by country. In total it includes grant funds from the&#13;
Global Environment Facility Trust Fund (GET) in the amount of US$12.5 million,&#13;
IDA funds equivalent to US$4.7 million, IBRD funding of US$6.8 million lent at&#13;
standard rates, CDB funds of US$8.7 million, an EU grant of US$1.9 million, and&#13;
the contribution from the EIB of US$6.4 million, also lent at their standard rates.&#13;
The balance of US$9.5 million is to be financed from the resources of each of the&#13;
participating OECS governments. Each of the participating Governments of the OECS&#13;
countries would be the borrower for their own share of the Project funds, including&#13;
their shares of the Regional Component. (Details for each country are presented at&#13;
Annexes B to G.)&#13;

investments in solid waste disposal (pro rata according to the proportion of marine to&#13;
total wastes received), and for most of the technical assistance/institutional building&#13;
component at the regional level (total of US$12.5 million). A combination of IDA,&#13;
EU, IBRD, CDB and EIB resources will support the balance of improvements in&#13;
domestic solid waste collection, treatment and disposal. The shortfall of about US$9.5&#13;
million, largely to cover the cost of land purchase (especially for the solid waste&#13;
landfill sites) and to cover taxes and duties on equipment and materials, will be&#13;
covered by the OECS governments themselves. The consultancy services which are&#13;
required to complete project designs and assist in project supervision will be funded&#13;
by a combination of resources from the GET, IBRD, IDA, CDB, EIB, and EU with&#13;
the GET funds being utilized for the regional components including the sewerage&#13;
technical assistance component.&#13;
E. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
3.13   The national components of the Project will be implemented by the solid waste&#13;
management entities. The solid waste management entities, which will be solely&#13;
owned by the respective governments, will be responsible for implementation of&#13;
improvements to the domestic solid waste management systems, and the appropriate&#13;
Port Authorities for certain of the port components. The NRMU of OECS will&#13;
implement the Regional Component. A Project Management Unit (PMU), to be&#13;
established at the regional level within the OECS Secretariat will undertake overall&#13;
co-ordination and consolidated monitoring of the project. It will also be responsible&#13;
for the implementation of the regional component. Initially, this PMU will be&#13;
operational for a five year period (beginning in 1995). After this period has elapsed,&#13;
member countries will evaluate the continued usefulness of the Unit and will, at that&#13;
time, determine whether it should continue to operate, either under its present&#13;
mandate or under a revised mandate adopting new criteria which should be included&#13;
in its terms of reference. Project Implementation Units (PIUs) will be established in&#13;
each country within the solid waste management entities, and be responsible for day-&#13;
to-day management and supervision of country-specific components. The PMU and&#13;
PIUs will include technical assistance support, to be provided by consultants&#13;
contracted either individually by each country, or for the Region as a whole. These&#13;
consultants would assume responsibility for the supervision and management of the&#13;
entire project, under the direction of the respective governments. All items included&#13;
in the country component will be procured through the Central Tender and Supplies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Committee of the respective governments. Procurement of ports related items will be&#13;
procured by the respective port authorities and items included in the regional&#13;
component will be procured by the PMU according to Bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;
3.14 Capital civil works for new construction and improvements will be carried out&#13;
by private contractors under the supervision of the PIUs. Equipment will be procured&#13;
internationally by each PIU on a country by country basis. Under the Regional&#13;
Component, technical experts will assist each of the countries to improve waste&#13;
management and monitoring throughout the OECS.&#13;
3.15  The implementation schedules for major activities related to each project&#13;
component are outlined in Annexes B through G for each country respectively.&#13;
3.16 Project implementation is over a five-year period beginning in July 1995. Civil&#13;
works contracts will commence in some islands as early as the third quarter of&#13;
calendar year 1995, and all civil works included under the project will take about 40&#13;
months to complete in all islands. Equipment would be procured by the port&#13;
authorities and solid waste management entities utilizing the existing procurement&#13;
arrangements and making use of the Central Tender and Supplies Committees/Boards&#13;
in all countries. It is anticipated that equipment would be delivered from December&#13;
1995, about six months after first notification of contracts to suppliers. Technical&#13;
assistance studies provided under the regional component for sewerage masterplans&#13;
would be implemented through the Water and Sewerage Authorities (WASAs) in&#13;
Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the&#13;
Grenadines, and the Ministry of Health (in St Kitts and Nevis). The regional&#13;
components of technical assistance on legal and operational issues and training will be&#13;
carried out under the overall direction of the PMU. The technical assistance&#13;
component for sewerage masterplanning would be carried out between July 1995 and&#13;
February 1996. The other technical assistance and training components would be&#13;
carried out over the full length of the project from July 1995 to June 2000. The&#13;
Project is expected to be completed by June 2000. A mid-term review of the Project&#13;
(about two and a half years from the date of effectiveness) will be carried out to&#13;
evaluate progress of implementation against planned objectives.&#13;
3.17  The Governments will take all legal and administrative steps required to ensure&#13;
access to the lands required for the Project. Acquisition of land for project&#13;
components will be a condition of effectiveness. The current status of the 13 landfill&#13;
sites covered by the project are as follows: Antigua and Barbuda, two sites of which&#13;
one is Government owned and the other is to be leased for about 35 years; Dominica,&#13;
one site which is owned by Government; Grenada, two sites of which both are owned&#13;
by Government, and of which one is currently undergoing Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment; St. Kitts and Nevis, two sites owned by Government; St. Lucia two sites&#13;
of which one is owned by Government and the second is currently being subjected to&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment; St. Vincent and the Grenadines, four sites, of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
which three are owned by Government and one is also identified but under&#13;
acquisition.&#13;
3.18  The equipment and civil works components outside the ports constructed under&#13;
the project (with the exception of the hospital waste incinerators) will be operated and&#13;
maintained by the newly established solid waste management entities. The equipment&#13;
and facilities provided at ports for the reception and handling of ship-generated waste&#13;
will be operated and maintained by the respective port authorities. Once constructed,&#13;
the hospital waste incinerators will be handed over to the hospital authorities for&#13;
operation and maintenance.&#13;
F. Procurement&#13;
3.19  Procurement arrangements for the overall project are summarized in Tables&#13;
3.3(a) to 3.3(g). Procurement of all contracts under the project is designed on a&#13;
parallel-financing basis and would follow the applicable guidelines of the individual&#13;
financing agency funding each component. The IBRD/IDA/GET financed&#13;
components would be procured as follows: (a) equipment and material purchase&#13;
costing US$100,000 or more would be procured through International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB; total estimated value - US$16.4 million); and (b) Limited (Regional)&#13;
Competitive Bidding (LCB), acceptable to the Bank Group, would be used to award&#13;
contracts below these limits (total estimated value - US$1.0 million). However, for&#13;
equipments and materials procurement of less than US$50,000 and civil works&#13;
contracts of less than US$100,000, International Shopping and Direct Purchase would&#13;
be permitted on the basis of at least three price quotations from at least two different&#13;
countries eligible under the guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. All items included in the country component will be procured through the&#13;
Central Tender and Supplies Committees or Tender Boards of the respective&#13;
governments. Procurement of port related items will be either through these Tender&#13;
Boards or directly by the respective port authorities, depending on the policy in each&#13;
country. Items included in the regional component will by procured by the PMU in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines.&#13;
3.20  The OECS countries have also agreed to the use of standard bid documents of&#13;
the Bank including: "Sample Prequalification Document for the Procurement of&#13;
Works" and "Sample Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works" for contracts&#13;
above US$0.5 million; and "Sample Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works&#13;
(smaller contracts)" for contracts below US$0.5 million. To minimize possible&#13;
adverse impacts on the environment during construction, the specifications for certain&#13;
civil works would also include appropriate clauses under which contractors would be&#13;
required to avoid or minimize environmental damage.&#13;
3.21  Consultants would be recruited in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for&#13;
the use of consultants, using the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultants'&#13;
Services. In the case of engineering supervision and project management service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
contracts, however, sole-sourcing of consultants could be permitted, as requested by&#13;
OECS governments and subject to approval by the Bank, to facilitate the use of the&#13;
same qualified firm(s) by all co-financiers; an arrangement that should lead to&#13;
improved coordination and administration of contracts. In the case of contracts for&#13;
the employment of consulting firms or individuals estimated to cost US$25,000&#13;
equivalent or less, Bank prior review will only be required for (a) the terms of&#13;
reference; (b) cases where single source selection is proposed; (c) assignments&#13;
deemed by the Bank to be of a critical nature and (d) amendments to consultancy&#13;
contracts for firms or individuals which raise the contract value to US$25,000&#13;
equivalent or above.&#13;
3.22 The Bank will review ex-ante all procurement documentation under ICB&#13;
(tender documents, bid evaluation and award recommendation). Contracts for goods&#13;
and works not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent, will be subject to ex-post-review by&#13;
the Association and the Bank. Consultancy contracts not exceeding US$25,000&#13;
equivalent would be subject to ex-post review by the Association and the Bank.&#13;

G. Disbursements&#13;
3.23 The proposed IBRD loan of US$7.4 million and the IDA credit of US$5.3&#13;
million equivalent would be disbursed as follows: (a) 100% of base project cost for&#13;
equipment, material and supplies (net of taxes and duties); (b) 100% of base cost&#13;
expenditure on civil works; and (c) 100% of the cost of consultancy services for&#13;
design and supervision of those components included for Bank funding.&#13;
3.24 All disbursements will be fully documented, except for payments against&#13;
contracts (works and equipment) not exceeding US$50,000 and Consultants not&#13;
exceeding US$25,000 which would be disbursed on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures (SOE). To the extent possible, all withdrawal applications should be&#13;
aggregated to no less than US$25,000. Supporting documents for amounts withdrawn&#13;
on the basis of SOEs would be held in a central location (both in the country and with&#13;
the PMU), and made available for review by auditors and visiting Bank supervision&#13;
missions. Retroactive financing of up to 10% of the Loan and Credit would be&#13;
considered provided that procurement was made according to Bank's guidelines and&#13;
that the expenditure was incurred less than one year prior to effectiveness.&#13;
3.25 The estimated disbursements are summarized in Table 3.4 which summarizes&#13;
the detailed disbursement schedules presented in Annexes B to G for each country.&#13;
IBRD and IDA funds are expected to be disbursed over a period of 5 years from&#13;
effectiveness to the closing date of December 31, 2000.&#13;
3.25  To facilitate disbursement, each Borrower would open a Special Account at the&#13;
East Caribbean Central Bank, or alternative commercial bank approved by the Bank,&#13;
for an amount equivalent to eight percent of the total of loan/credit/grant funds, and&#13;
which represents about four month average expenditure. Applications for&#13;
replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted on a quarterly basis, or&#13;
when one third of the Special Account deposit has been withdrawn, whichever occurs&#13;
earlier. In addition to normal documentation evidencing payment, each replenishment&#13;
application would be supported by monthly bank statements of the Special Account&#13;
which have been reconciled by the PIU. All other applications for direct payments or&#13;
Special Commitments must be for an amount not less than 20% of the Special&#13;
Account deposit.&#13;

H. Accounting, Reporting, Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
3.26 Accounting: Project accounts will be maintained by the Ministries of Finance&#13;
in each of the participating countries for civil works, equipment procurement, and&#13;
national technical assistance components. The NRMU of the OECS Secretariat will&#13;
maintain accounts for the Regional component including institutional strengthening&#13;
and training components. Country accounts will be consolidated in the Ministries of&#13;
Finance and made available for inspection by Bank supervision missions. These&#13;
accounts will be copied to the PMU quarterly who will maintain consolidated accounts&#13;
for the project as a whole. All project accounts will be audited annually by an&#13;
independent auditor according to recognized international standards. The&#13;
Governments and OECS Secretariat will submit certified copies of the accounts and&#13;
annual Audit Reports to the Bank not later than three months after the end of each&#13;
audited period.&#13;
3.27  Reporting:  will be carried out at two levels: (i) to deternine progress of the&#13;
project, and (ii) to monitor the efficiency of the newly formed solid waste&#13;
management entities in performing against their mandate according to national solid&#13;
waste management plans.&#13;
3.28 For the project, the PIUs will prepare, and submit through the PMU for Bank&#13;
review, quarterly progress reports on the execution of the infrastructure works and&#13;
procurement of equipment. The PMU will be responsible for the consolidation of&#13;
quarterly reports from all project countries. Each fiscal year, the PIUs will prepare a&#13;
progress report of the preceding year and annual implementation plans for the&#13;
forthcoming year based on the projected project implementation program and progress&#13;
will be evaluated against this plan. This plan will be finalized taking into account&#13;
Bank's comments.&#13;
3.29 Monitoring of the performance of the solid waste management entities&#13;
themselves will be carried over the duration of the Project. Every fiscal year,&#13;
concurrently with the preparation of the annual budget, the governments will prepare&#13;
a progress report of the preceding year's operations, and a detailed solid waste&#13;
management and maintenance program, and its funding, for the forthcoming year.&#13;
The progress report for the preceding year and subsequent annual program including&#13;
funding will be furnished to the Bank for review through the PMU by December 31&#13;
of each year.&#13;
3.30  The PMU (para.3.14) will consolidate quarterly and annual reports from the&#13;
countries and will produce an Annual Report of its own activities to be submitted to&#13;
the Bank and member countries through the OECS Secretariat. In addition, the&#13;
Borrowers will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR) to be submitted to&#13;
IBRD/IDA not later than six (6) months after the closing date of the Loan/Credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
3.31  Monitoring: Monitoring of project progress will be undertaken by the PMU&#13;
at the regional level and the PIUs at the national level. Monitoring of the&#13;
effectiveness of implementation and operation of ship-generated waste management&#13;
systems will be undertaken at the regional level, with information concerning the&#13;
implementation of these systems gathered on a semi-monthly basis country by&#13;
country. In addition, the newly formed solid waste management entities in each&#13;
country will be monitored in the manner referred to above. A brief report will be&#13;
prepared twice per year that summarizes the experience of each country in this sector,&#13;
and the report will be distributed to all project countries. The intent of the report will&#13;
be to assist countries in the implementation of these systems through the dissemination&#13;
of information regarding problems that have been encountered and solutions that have&#13;
been developed in response to these problems. The project is designed to include a&#13;
set of key indicators for use in monitoring and evaluation of both the project and the&#13;
solid waste management system as a whole. The purpose is to facilitate appropriate&#13;
assessment of the impact of the project on each country and to encourage the&#13;
introduction of adjustments when and where necessary. Development of these criteria&#13;
and their adoption would form part of the regional component, but suitable indicators&#13;
for the overall project would include: (a) adherence to collection schedules; (b)&#13;
equipment downtime and reasons; (c) frequency and nature of public complaint; (d)&#13;
coverage by system; (e) cost per ton of disposal; and (f) employee performance,&#13;
absence etc. For the maritimne component specifically, the volume and characteristics&#13;
of wastes landed (including composition and whether compacted or sterilized etc)&#13;
would be closely monitored and measured throughout the period of implementation,&#13;
and a database of this information would be established in each country and for the&#13;
region; (there is no data available on waste landed on the islands from ships and&#13;
yachts at present). The degree of compliance by ships with the regulations of&#13;
MARPOL 73/78 would also be closely monitored. In addition, through the education&#13;
element of the regional component, community and NGO involvement in beach clean-&#13;
up and similar campaigns would be encouraged to provide data on the impact of the&#13;
project on marine debris landing on the beaches of the region. A mid-term review of&#13;
the Project (about two and a half years from date of effectiveness) will be carried out&#13;
to evaluate progress of implementation against planned objectives.&#13;
I. Environmental Assessments&#13;
3.32  Environmental Impact Assessments have been prepared, and hydrogeological&#13;
surveys have been undertaken, for each project site in all the countries. The focus of&#13;
these assessments has been on the proposed sanitary landfill disposal sites. Where&#13;
necessary and appropriate, design of the landfill sites should incorporate measures to&#13;
mitigate the potential negative environmental impacts associated with odor, fly and&#13;
rodent nuisance, and leachate and gas migration. The environmental assessments&#13;
generally confirmed the appropriateness of site choice. Where land acquisition or&#13;
other site problems were identified, necessitating new site selection, the governments&#13;
have agreed to arrange for new hydrogeological surveys and preparation of complete&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
environmental assessments on these new sites, in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
An Environmental Assessment Summary Report on the project, submitted by the&#13;
OECS countries, was provided to the Board on Dec. 1,1993 (Sec M 93-1218).&#13;
Completion and submission to the Bank of detailed EIAs for all project sites is a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness (see below).&#13;
IV. TIE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES&#13;
4.1   National Solid Waste Management Entities, wholly owned by governments and&#13;
formed through the existing institutional framework of each country, will be created&#13;
to administer and deliver waste management services, and ensure financial&#13;
sustainability of the proposed waste management systems. These waste management&#13;
entities are being established in such a manner so as to be financially independent,&#13;
and will be dedicated to the management of solid waste. Private sector participation&#13;
will be encouraged for collection services, landfill operations and equipment&#13;
maintenance. Initially, the scope for private sector involvement is limited in all of the&#13;
beneficiary countries due to their small size and weak private sector activity. Draft&#13;
guidelines of duties and responsibilities of these waste management entities have been&#13;
provided to the Governments, and discussed in detail with the Bank. The&#13;
governments have already made progress towards the setting up of these waste&#13;
management entities, and their establishment will be a condition of effectiveness of&#13;
the national components.&#13;
4.2   The prime objectives of the waste management entities will be to:&#13;
(a)   Assume overall responsibility for implementation of the Solid Waste&#13;
Management Project;&#13;
(b)   collect and manage the revenue required for the on-going&#13;
implementation of the waste management plan;&#13;
(c)   provide for the delivery of waste management services in accordance&#13;
with the waste management plan;&#13;
(d)   revise and modify the waste management plan as necessary to reflect&#13;
changing circumstances and new requirements;&#13;
(e)   participate in regional waste management initiatives including the&#13;
development of recyclable materials, model waste management&#13;
legislation, model environmental education initiatives, and&#13;
implementation of programs for the management of international&#13;
wastes; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
(f)   advise the OECS governments of legislation and policies required for&#13;
the effective implementation of waste management activities.&#13;
4.3   The main duties and responsibilities of the waste management entities which&#13;
will be assigned in order to meet the above objectives will include the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
(a)   Revenue Management: The waste management entities will identify, on&#13;
an annual basis, the revenue necessary to implement waste management&#13;
services detailed in the waste management plan as presented, or as&#13;
modified in future years in accordance with prevailing requirements;&#13;
(b)   Delivery of Waste Management Services: The waste management&#13;
entities will be responsible for the administration and delivery of all&#13;
waste management services including collection, transportation,&#13;
reutilization and disposal of wastes and the letting of contracts for&#13;
elements of the system to the private sector as deemed appropriate;&#13;
(c)   Revision and Modification of Waste Management Plans: These will be&#13;
updated as necessary to reflect changing circumstances and&#13;
requirements in the interests of increasing system efficiency and cost&#13;
effectiveness;&#13;
(d)   Coordination with the Regional Waste Management Initiatives: During&#13;
the first five years these activities are to include; (i) development of&#13;
model legislation; (ii) development of model environmental education&#13;
initiatives; (iii) identification and development of local and extra-&#13;
regional markets for recyclable and composite materials; (iv)&#13;
implementation and enforcement of initiatives for the management of&#13;
ship-generated wastes and of hazardous cargoes at ports; and (v)&#13;
information sharing at annual OECS waste management workshops.&#13;
(e)    Development of Legislation and Policies: These will encompass; (i)&#13;
revenue generation, expenditure and cost control mechanisms; (ii)&#13;
scoping of waste management service; (iii) participation in regional&#13;
activities; (iv) determination of requirements of waste generators vis-a-&#13;
vis the waste management system; and (v) siting/construction of waste&#13;
management facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Financing Waste Management&#13;
5.1   Presently waste management is financed by the OECS countries from general&#13;
revenues and through the Ministries of Health in most countries. When ship wastes&#13;
are landed they are removed by a contractor at the expense of the shipping lines and&#13;
deposited at the landfill site without charge. Currently, ships' waste constitute only a&#13;
very small proportion of the total volume of waste generated. In 1993 the&#13;
governments of the OECS countries spent a total of about US$4.6 million on waste&#13;
management, of which about US$1.2 million was spent by Antigua and Barbuda,&#13;
US$0.3 million by St. Kitts and Nevis, US$1.4 million by St. Vincent and the&#13;
Grenadines, US$ 0.7 million by Grenada, US$ 0.3 million by Dominica and US$ 0.7&#13;
million by St. Lucia.&#13;
B. Cost Recovery and Profitability&#13;
5.2   Because of limited financial resources, the OECS countries would prefer to&#13;
recover fully the costs of procurement, construction, operation and maintenance and&#13;
provide for the eventual full replacement of the system. To accomplish full cost&#13;
recovery, a four-tier financing arrangement will be introduced as follows: (a) revenue&#13;
generated from the introduction of an environmental levy of US$1.50 per tourist&#13;
including cruise ship passengers; (b) continue government budgetary allocations for&#13;
waste management; (c) tipping fees of US$20.00 per ton at the landfill from&#13;
industrial, commercial and institutional (IC&amp;I) waste and US$40.00 per ton&#13;
(excluding haulage) for maritime waste; and (d) revenue generated from the recovery&#13;
and recycling of wastes. In addition, a "waste minimization tax" could be levied by&#13;
countries on disposable products (including packaging) imported from abroad and&#13;
applied at the port of entry. A tax of this nature should have the benefit of providing&#13;
revenue and encouraging waste minimization on imported goods (which comprise a&#13;
significant proportion of the waste stream). This potential source of revenue does not&#13;
figure in the cost recovery proposals at present but will be evaluated under the&#13;
Regional Component and could be considered by the countries for the future. External&#13;
charges (such as the cruise-ship and yacht passenger charges) will be based on&#13;
common guidelines both for consistency and for ensuring that those affected (cruise&#13;
ships and/or their passengers) are charged at similar rates throughout the OECS&#13;
countries.&#13;
5.3   Tipping Fees for IC&amp;I Waste: IC&amp;I wastes are frequently collected by&#13;
private contractors and disposed off at the landfill site without any payment being&#13;
made. There is a potential for revenue collection from IC&amp;I wastes through a tipping&#13;
fee which would be collected on a per unit of weight basis at the disposal site. At a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
unit rate averaging US$20.00 per ton it is anticipated that a total of US$1.5 million&#13;
could be raised per annum at 1997 values.&#13;
5.4   Recycling Revenue: Although there is a potential for revenue collection from&#13;
recycling, the amounts available for recycling, on a per country basis, and the&#13;
distances to potential markets will entail some detailed analysis and a strong&#13;
marketing strategy. It may be that the most realistic option will be to pursue this on a&#13;
regional basis and for this reason the Regional PMU will be tasked with this issue&#13;
(see Annex J para. 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23). Potential revenue collected from this&#13;
source is expected to be in the range of US$50,000 per year after about 5 years of&#13;
operation.&#13;
5.5    Government Budgetary Allocations: In the past, the government has made&#13;
budgetary provisions for waste collection, treatment and disposal. With the project,&#13;
the governments will maintain their budgetary allocations at present real values for the&#13;
foreseeable future, basically to cover the residential waste collection, treatment and&#13;
disposal. However, the amount contributed by the government will depend to a great&#13;
extent on the need to bridge the gap between revenue collected from the&#13;
environmental tax and from the tipping charges associated with the disposal of waste&#13;
from cruise ships, yachts, cargo vessels, and IC&amp;I, and from the recycling revenues.&#13;
These amounts are expected to be substantial in the long term, which should result in&#13;
an eventual decrease in commitment of government resources. This in itself will&#13;
constitute a "saving" on revenue to the government which may then be used for other&#13;
purposes.&#13;
5.6    Direct Charge to Householders: In order to reduce the level of budgetary&#13;
allocations to the solid waste management service, some of the project countries are&#13;
planning to introduce direct charging to householders for this service. While this&#13;
option is being pursued vigorously in some instances, such potential revenues have&#13;
not been included in the financial forecasts.&#13;
C. Forecast Financial Performance&#13;
5.7   Financial Costs and Revenues: The financial costs for the project have been&#13;
annualized to the year 20 (assumed to be the project life). Capital costs and recurrent&#13;
costs for: port reception facilities (in the major ports and small crafts harbors), shore&#13;
generated waste treatment activities (including collection and transport, transfer&#13;
stations, buy-back depots, material recovery facilities, waste disposal facilities and&#13;
medical waste facilities), and support activities (including the regional component,&#13;
institutional/management, training and human resource development, enforcement and&#13;
environmental education) have all been included in the costs (both capital and&#13;
recurrent). These recurrent costs include full capital replacement costs for all&#13;
equipment both already being operated and to be procured under the project. Primary&#13;
sources of revenue are environmental tax to be levied on all tourists (including cruise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
ship passengers) visiting each country of US$ 1.50, tipping charges for maritime and&#13;
industrial, institutional and commercial waste, and maintenance of the current levels&#13;
of government subventions to the solid waste management system. Projections&#13;
indicate that the levying of these charges will mean generation of a surplus of about&#13;
US$ 700,000 equivalent per year across all countries by 1998 (see tables B8, C7, D7,&#13;
E8, F8, and G7 in Annexes B, C, D, E, F and G respectively). These projections&#13;
disregard the potential income from recycling and materials recovery which should&#13;
provide significant revenues after 1996.&#13;
As noted in para. 5.5, revenue from recycling will depend on a number of variables,&#13;
the impact of which is presently unknown. Based on the above analysis it can be&#13;
assumed that the project will eventually result in substantial savings to the government&#13;
budget. If these savings do not fully materialize, government will have to continue to&#13;
allocate resources to the solid waste management system at the current rate.&#13;
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Demand for Services&#13;
6.1   In 1992 total estimated shore-generated waste in the project countries&#13;
amounted to 159,000 tons of which about 109,500 (69%) was collected. By 1996 the&#13;
total waste generated is estimated to grow to about 176,500 tons (an increase of just&#13;
over 2% which reflects a likely slight increase in the rate of generation per capita).&#13;
In the absence of the project, the average collection rate is likely to remain at about&#13;
68%. With completion of the proposed project in 1999 however, a 14% increase in&#13;
collection efficiency to about 82% is anticipated due to the full operationalization of&#13;
the facilities which will allow for the capture of a substantial number of new clients.&#13;
From 1998 to the year 2015, average annual growth in waste is forecast to remain at&#13;
a constant rate of growth of about 1 % per annum as increased per capita generation is&#13;
moderated through the recovery and recycling efforts.&#13;
6.2   In 1992 total ship-generated waste which could potentially be disposed of in&#13;
the project countries was estimated to be at least 3,900 tons, based on a total number&#13;
of about 900,000 crew and ship passenger arrivals. About 89% of arrivals are&#13;
estimated to comprise cruise-ship passengers, 10% yacht passengers and I% cargo&#13;
ship crew and passengers. Currently the proportion of this waste which is landed is&#13;
unknown, but is thought to be small in the absence of any reception facilities. With&#13;
the provision of these facilities under the project, most of this waste is expected to be&#13;
landed. However, what will become increasingly important for the future in arriving&#13;
at projections of wastes to be disposed of in the ports of call, is the management of&#13;
wastes on-board ships, particularly cruise ships, since the amount of waste generated&#13;
is directly proportional to the number of passengers on-board. Space on-board is at a&#13;
premium, which will continue to encourage ship operators to minimize the amount of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
waste stored on board. Food wastes will most likely continue to be disposed of at sea&#13;
(permitted under MARPOL). Consequently, an estimated 35 % of the total amount of&#13;
ship-generated waste will not require landing at OECS ports, provided it is managed&#13;
in accordance with MARPOL requirements. Modem ships, and particularly cruise&#13;
ships, are likely to increasingly be fitted with on-board incineration capacity which&#13;
can achieve volume reductions of waste of up to 85%. Older vessels are also being&#13;
retrofitted with waste reduction capabilities (for example compaction and shredding).&#13;
In addition, certain wastes have potential for recycling. All of these management&#13;
practices will have a signiificant impact on the quantity and volume of ship-generated&#13;
wastes that will be landed at OECS ports by both cruise ships and cargo vessels.&#13;
Table 6.1 indicates the correlation between number of ships landing and the number&#13;
of passengers projected for the year 1995.&#13;

Note: Statistics on yacht calls are sketchy and inconsistent. However, available data suggests that about 10%&#13;
of passengers arriving in the project countries come by cargo vessel and yachts, with cargo vessels typically&#13;
representing about 10% of the number and yachts the remainder. Yachts vary in size and crew but can be&#13;
assumed to average four people while the average number of passengers per cruise ships is closer to 1200.&#13;
with 2.75 passengers per crew member.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
6.3   In terms of future projections, it is forecast that the growth in visitor arrivals&#13;
both by sea and air will continue to grow steadily at 5% per annum to the year 2010.&#13;
For arrivals by sea this growth is assumed to flatten out to a I % growth rate per year&#13;
thereafter, which will provide for an overall increase in the number of visitor arrivals&#13;
by sea of 50% during the project period. In terms of shore-generated waste, this is&#13;
forecast to grow at about 2% annually up to project completion in 1999 when a 14%&#13;
increase in collection efficiency is anticipated. Thereafter, to 2015, annual growth in&#13;
waste is forecast to remain flat at about 1 % annual growth per year as natural&#13;
increase is offset by recovery and recycling efforts.&#13;
B. Economic and Financial Evaluation&#13;
6.4    The tourist sector contributes substantially to the economies of all of the&#13;
countries (Table 6.2). In 1990, 1.3 million tourists spent over US$570 million in the&#13;
OECS countries, up sharply from levels of a decade earlier. Tourism is an important&#13;
generator of employment, government revenue and foreign exchange, and contributes&#13;
substantially to GDP. Value added from tourism in the six OECS countries amounted&#13;
to US$197 million in 1990, 16% of GDP. In the economic evaluation exercise, a&#13;
linear impact of tourism spending on GDP at 1990 levels is assumed, so that a 1 %&#13;
drop in tourism spending is assumed to result in a decrease in GDP of US$1.97&#13;
million. Dependence on tourism is expected to continue to grow in these countries,&#13;
not only because of their favorable attributes, but also because of the decline of some&#13;
of the traditional sectors, particularly agriculture.&#13;

6.5   Recurrent costs include labor, operations and annualized replacement charge,&#13;
with overhead and contingencies as applicable, and include the total cost of the&#13;
regional component. Annualized replacement charges are calculated such that after&#13;
Year 5 capital expenditures can be financed without loans. The full recurrent costs of&#13;
the Project will be felt in Year 2 and will not increase thereafter at a rate that exceeds&#13;
the assumed rate of inflation of 3.1 %. The total recurrent costs in 1993 US dollars in&#13;
Year 2 and subsequently for all countries are about US$11 million ($12 million in&#13;
1996 dollars).&#13;
6.6   Recurrent costs can be recovered in a number of ways, including tipping and&#13;
other fees for waste disposal. Revenues from tipping fees, however, are ignored in&#13;
the economic analysis since they correspond to benefit sharing among the population&#13;
and not an increase in total benefit. They are, however, relevant for both financial&#13;
analysis and measuring the impact of the project on public finances. One scenario by&#13;
which recurrent costs could be covered in 1996 is as follows:&#13;
(a)   Government Contribution - existing waste management budgets&#13;
increased by 3.1 % per year to 1996&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
(b)   Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Contribution - a tipping fee (or&#13;
equivalent) of US $20.00 per ton will cover the full cost of managing&#13;
these wastes&#13;
(c)    Marine Tourist Contribution - a waste disposal fee of US $40.00 per&#13;
ton (excluding costs of haulage) for waste landed in OECS countries&#13;
plus an environmental levy of US $1.50 per marine tourist&#13;
(d)   Stayover Tourist Contribution - an environmental levy of $US 1.50&#13;
charged to each stayover tourist ( estimated revenue US $1.2 million).&#13;
6.7   No net present value or economic rate of return was calculated for the project,&#13;
but least cost analysis and willingness to pay criteria were applied. Appropriate solid&#13;
waste disposal has environmental and health benefits that are not readily quantified. In&#13;
tourist destinations such as the OECS countries, there are also more direct--but still&#13;
difficult to quantify--economic benefits. A wide range of alternative project designs&#13;
were considered in preparing the project, and the one selected is the least cost&#13;
consistent with reasonable environmental guidelines and with the OECS countries'&#13;
obligations under MARPOL 73/78.&#13;
C. Project Risks&#13;
6.8   The main risks relate to the effective operation and maintenance of the project&#13;
components, as well as the ability of the countries to achieve full cost recovery for&#13;
the enhanced systems. One specific risk is that there will be insufficient strengthening&#13;
of the institutional arrangements for appropriate solid waste management. As this&#13;
project will add substantially to the tasks being undertaken by solid waste management&#13;
authorities and introduce new activities for most of the ports, the creation of the solid&#13;
waste management entities and strengthening of existing institutions is an integral part&#13;
of the project. A further risk is that ports will fail to police and implement the&#13;
provisions of the special area designation of the Wider Caribbean under MARPOL&#13;
73/78 effectively. Another major risk is that the countries will fail to raise sufficient&#13;
revenues to cover the costs of the additional and improved services being offered.&#13;
Thus, the governments' ability to introduce an enviromnental tax on all the tourists is&#13;
a key issue. These risks will be mitigated through the fact that: (a) countries are&#13;
already moving towards the establishment of their solid waste management entities;&#13;
(b) negotiations have already been initiated with the cruise lines on the procedures&#13;
associated with management of landed ship generated waste; and (c) the project&#13;
includes a strong institutional strengthening and training component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
6.9   The risks noted above should be further mitigated through: (a) the introduction&#13;
of port-state verification of ship generated wastes, which will be achieved with the aid&#13;
of training and technical assistance through project implementation; and (b) the&#13;
regional provision of a common base for port charges and the introduction of a cost-&#13;
based tariff schedule for the new services being offered by the ports. The countries&#13;
have agreed to move towards full cost recovery for solid waste management services&#13;
by the phased introduction of adequate cost recovery mechanisms. As a first step,&#13;
they are committed to, and have already commenced with the establishment of solid&#13;
waste management entities in advance of the project. These authorities would&#13;
eventually assume responsibility for all solid waste management functions in the&#13;
countries, contracting out elements of the system as deemed appropriate.&#13;
VII. AGREEM1ENTS REACHED AND TO BE REACHED,&#13;
CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVENESS&#13;
AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
7.1   A number of issues have already been agreed upon with each Govermnent.&#13;
These specific issues include:&#13;
(a)   The scope and content of each national project component and the&#13;
regional component.&#13;
(b)   The institutional and legislative framework for the establishment of a&#13;
Waste Management Entity in each country with separate accounting,&#13;
and the establishrnent of special accounts through which the project&#13;
proceeds would be channeled for disbursement on project components.&#13;
(c)   An action plan and definition of an associated implementation period to&#13;
streamline the solid waste management institutional arrangements and&#13;
administration in each country, and to move towards the establishment&#13;
of the proposed National Solid Waste Management Entities. This will&#13;
involve the transfer to the new entity of all responsibilities for the&#13;
planning and management of activities related to solid waste including:&#13;
(i) solid waste collection, (ii) solid waste treatment and disposal, and&#13;
(iii) the collection of fees and charges related to the provision of the&#13;
solid waste collection and treatment service.&#13;
(d)   Agreement between the countries on the proposed environmental tax on&#13;
all visitors (by sea and air), and that the OECS Secretariat would&#13;
informn those concerned of the decision of the governments to levy this&#13;
tax.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
(e)   Agreement on the details of cost recovery mechanisms for the solid&#13;
waste management systems and associated solid waste charges to be&#13;
levied, and in particular the unified tipping fee for marine waste of&#13;
US$40 per ton.&#13;
(f)    Agreement on the accounting, auditing and reporting requirements for&#13;
the project.&#13;
(g)   Agreement on the adoption of monitoring indicators for the improved&#13;
solid waste management system to be put into effect once the project is&#13;
made effective in each country.&#13;
(h)   Agreement on the procurement procedures for works, goods and&#13;
services to be financed under the proposed Project.&#13;
(i)    Agreement with the co-financing institutions on common issues relating&#13;
to project implementation and reporting, and on conditions for&#13;
effectiveness and disbursement.&#13;
7.2   In addition, agreement was reached on activities to be carried out in each&#13;
country prior to effectiveness. These activities are:&#13;
(a)   That the recipient has put into effect the legal framework, and&#13;
established the charging mechanisms, for the proposed cost recovery&#13;
scheme.&#13;
(b)   That the recipient has put into effect the legal framework creating and&#13;
governing the operation of the Solid Waste Management Entity,&#13;
established the accounts, agreed the relationship between the Entity and&#13;
Government, hired the Solid Waste Manager, and confirmed to the&#13;
Bank that the Entity and the PIU are operational.&#13;
(c)   That the recipient has acquired the proposed landfill site(s) and its&#13;
access or entered into long term lease for the site(s) and provided&#13;
evidence of this to the Bank; and is acquiring any further land required&#13;
for the construction of waste recycling facilities and transfer stations.&#13;
(d)   That the recipient has completed, to the satisfaction of the Bank,&#13;
environmental assessments for all landfill sites according to Bank's&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
(e)    That agreement has been reached between the recipient and CDB&#13;
and/or EIB and/or EU (as appropriate) on the components of the&#13;
project being supported by these funding agencies which are parallel-&#13;
financing the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-.45 -&#13;
7.3   In addition, a condition of disbursement on the landfill sites is submission of&#13;
evidence that an agreement between the individual beneficiary countries and CEHI, or&#13;
any other competent agency acceptable to the Bank, has been reached on a monitoring&#13;
program to test and evaluate, from time to time, the environmental integrity of the&#13;
sanitary landfills financed under the project.&#13;
7.4   Subject to satisfactory completion by the Governments of the above actions,&#13;
the proposed Project qualifies for a Loan/Credit of a total of US$11.5 million, with&#13;
US$6.8 million equivalent as an IBRD Loan and US$4.7 million equivalent as an IDA&#13;
Credit. Standard IBRD and IDA terms will be adopted.&#13;

ANNEX A&#13;
THE N4RPOL CONVENTION AN] THE SPECIAL AREA&#13;
DESIGNATION OF THE WIDER CARIBBEAN&#13;
vARPOL CONVENTION&#13;
1.    Growing international concern for protection of the environment generally,&#13;
including the marine environment in particular, led to the convening of the United&#13;
Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972 which drew attention,&#13;
amongst other things, to the need to protect the oceans from vessel-source pollution.&#13;
A series of tanker casualties, the increasing amount of wastes dumped in the ocean&#13;
and chronic pollution of beaches and coastal waters had drawn global attention to this&#13;
problem.&#13;
2.    The international community's response to the above concerns was the&#13;
adoption, under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) of the&#13;
Intemational Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (1973) and a&#13;
Protocol to that Convention (1978), together normally referred to as MARPOL 73/78&#13;
with the aim of reducing and, if required, eliminating the long-standing practice of&#13;
discharging wastes from ships into the marine environment.&#13;
3.   iMARPOL 73/78 requires both that ships retain their wastes on board,&#13;
discharging them only at their port of call, and that ports provide adequate reception&#13;
facilities to receive these wastes.&#13;
4.    Different types of substances or cargo carried by ships are addressed in the&#13;
five annexes of MARPOL 73/78 as follows:&#13;
Annex I, oil;&#13;
Annex II, noxious liquid substances in bulk;&#13;
Annex III, harmful substances in packaged forms;&#13;
Annex IV, sewage; and&#13;
Annex V, garbage.&#13;
5.    Ratification of MARPOL 73/78 by a State does not necessarily have to include&#13;
all annexes. Annexes III,IV and V are referred to as optional Annexes that need not&#13;
be accepted by a State when it ratifies or accedes to MARPOL 73/78. However, the&#13;
optional Annexes cannot be ratified separately; these can only be ratified in&#13;
combination with or after ratification of Annexes I and II of MARPOL 73/78.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
6.    MARPOL 73/78 and its Annexes provide specific discharge standards for&#13;
different substances. For some substances (e.g. plastics in Annex V) MARPOL 73/78&#13;
introduces a complete ban on their discharge. It also provides for the option of&#13;
designating specific sea areas as "special areas" under Annex I and II or V (or under&#13;
a combination of these Annexes). Stricter discharge regulations apply to these special&#13;
areas.&#13;
7.    Following an IMO/UNEP sponsored workshop in Caracas, October 1990, and&#13;
also the 30th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the&#13;
IMO, November 1990, several Governments in the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR)&#13;
sought from the MEPC a "Special Area" designation for the WCR's sea area under&#13;
Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Under this arrangement, ships are prohibited from&#13;
discharging garbage at sea within the Gulf of Mexico and the WCR. A proposal was&#13;
presented to MEPC's 31st session where it was formallv adopted on July 4, 1991&#13;
(MEPC Res. 48(31)). The amendment entered into force on 4 April 1993.&#13;
8.    The States and Territories of the WCR were invited to examine in detail the&#13;
implications of the "Special Area" designation and to endeavor to provide adequate&#13;
and acceptable reception facilities for Annex V wastes throughout the region. The&#13;
"Special Area" designation for the WCR will only become effective one year after the&#13;
required reception facilities are established and made operational in the ports of the&#13;
region.&#13;
9.    The provision of reception facilities is a major instrument in MARPOL&#13;
73/78's efforts to reduce or end the discharge of ship-generated wastes into the&#13;
marine environment. Annexes I, II and V contain regulations with regard to reception&#13;
facilities that must be provided in ports, respectively for oily wastes, noxious liquid&#13;
substances, and garbage. MARPOL 73/78's effectiveness in combating marine&#13;
pollution from ships is as much determined by the effectiveness of its regulations&#13;
regarding the provision of reception facilities as it is by the effectiveness of&#13;
implementation and enforcement of its requirements concerning port inspection and&#13;
reporting.&#13;
10.   There are, however, other important elements that determine the effectiveness&#13;
of MARPOL 73/78 worldwide and also in the WCR and more specifically, in the&#13;
States and Territories of the WCR. These dictate that:&#13;
the relevant national primary and secondary maritime legislation has to&#13;
be in place and up to date and many of the important IMO Conventions&#13;
other than MARPOL 73/78 are also ratified and implemented by&#13;
adoption of national legislation;&#13;
MARPOL 73/78, including its optional Annexes (in particular Annex&#13;
V) be ratified;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3-&#13;
MARPOL 73/78's provisions are implemented by adoption of&#13;
appropriate national legislation and that there exists an effective&#13;
institutional framework both for the legislative process for drafting and&#13;
adoption of the necessary laws and an effective maritime administration&#13;
for the overview, implementation and enforcement thereof;&#13;
MARPOL 73/78's provisions are actively enforced by the States and&#13;
Territories in the WCR to ensure full compliance with its regulations;&#13;
other relevant international instruments (e.g. the Cartagena Convention,&#13;
the London Convention, the Vina del Mar Agreement, and the Basel&#13;
Convention) should also be ratified and implemented; and&#13;
reception facilities for ship-generated wastes be provided, the&#13;
institutional arrangements for effective operation of these facilities be in&#13;
place, and strategies and infrastructure for the effective management&#13;
(e.g. treatment, disposal) of these wastes be developed.&#13;
11.   In the WCR (and in other regions of the world for that matter), MARPOL&#13;
73/78 is not yet as effective as it could and should be. While it is not possible to&#13;
analyze the causes within the framework of this document, it is possible to give some&#13;
indications of the current situation.&#13;
12.   National primary and secondary maritime legislation in many developing&#13;
countries of the WCR needs to be further developed or updated. In some cases, there&#13;
is not even legislation covering the main institutions of law, which is the necessary&#13;
foundation of a maritime legal regime. In others, general enabling and primary&#13;
maritime legislation may be in place, but the necessary regulations and other measures&#13;
necessary to give the enabling legislation practical effect have either not been&#13;
developed or may not be up to date or effective. Some progress has been made in&#13;
some countries in this area in respect of enactment of shipping legislation or updating&#13;
outdated legislation, or both, as a result of, among other developments, bi-lateral&#13;
projects, the appointment of a Regional Maritime Safety Advisor for the Caribbean by&#13;
the IMO, and the appointment of a Regional Consultant on Marine Pollution, Port&#13;
Safety and Security for the Wider Caribbean. Another important initiative is the&#13;
LEGISMAR project in five Central American States established under UN auspices&#13;
with the IMO as executing agency to promote adoption and implementation of&#13;
comprehensive maritime legislation. In spite of the efforts through these and other&#13;
projects, however, much remains to be done.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
13.   Many States and Territories in the Wider Caribbean have not ratified a&#13;
substantial number of important safety related IMO Conventions nor MARPOL 73/78.&#13;
14.   The lack of national maritime legislation is especially great in relation to&#13;
implementation of MARPOL 73/78 despite the excellent initiatives that have already&#13;
been launched by the various IMO resident experts and numerous ad hoc consultants&#13;
employed by the IMO and concerned States and international organizations in this&#13;
area. In addition, coordination of legislation is lacking in the area as a whole and in&#13;
most of its sub-regions. There is virtually a Tabula rasa for development and&#13;
enactment of the necessary primnary and secondary legislation, to encourage and&#13;
enable ratification of MARPOL 73/78, etc.. This situation presents a unique&#13;
opportunity to develop legislation in the region on a harmonized and a coordinated&#13;
basis, which is vital to the successful operation of MARPOL 73/78 and especially&#13;
Annexes I, II and V.&#13;
15.   Inforrnation with regard to the availability of the various types of reception&#13;
facilities for the reception of wastes in the ports and harbors of the WCR is&#13;
incomplete. A number of publications (LIoyd's Ports of the World 1993, a document&#13;
by the International Chamber of Shipping submitted to the MEPC in 1990, and&#13;
MIEPC Circular 234 containing information provided by Contracting Parties about&#13;
reception facilities for oily wastes) provide information about the situation with&#13;
regard to the availability of such facilities in ports in the WCR, but this information is&#13;
in some cases several years old, and in all cases incomplete. A special limited survey&#13;
reviewing port reception and disposal facilities for garbage in the Wider Caribbean&#13;
was carried out in 1991 by Environmental Resources Ltd. for the IMO and the World&#13;
Bank. It indicates that it is more than a likely that facilities for the reception of ship-&#13;
generated wastes are not available in many of the ports and harbors of the WCR.&#13;
16.   It is generally recognized that the most important problem of ship-generated&#13;
wastes may not be the reception of such wastes in ports, but the management and&#13;
disposal or treatment of these wastes once they have been brought into ports. This&#13;
issue was also addressed in the Environrnental Resources Ltd. study of 1991.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES FOR THE WIDER CARIBBEAN INITIATIVE FOR&#13;
SHIP-GENERATED WASTE&#13;
17.   The objective of this project is to provide the basis for ratification and&#13;
implementation of the MARPOL 73/78 convention by the developing countries of the&#13;
WCR. Project activities would contribute to this objective by providing govermnents&#13;
with (i) informnation on legal, technical, and institutional measures needed on a&#13;
regional and national basis to implement MARPOL 73/78; and (ii) a forum for&#13;
considering, options and for reaching a regional consensus on the actions to be taken.&#13;
Assuming that the States and Territories of the WCR decide to ratify and implement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
MARPOL 73/78 building on this project's outputs, a second phase program could be&#13;
agreed with international donor community support, consisting of investments in port&#13;
reception facilities, waste management infrastructure, and institutional training&#13;
programs, that would contribute to the longer term goal of ending the discharge of all&#13;
ship-generated waste into international waters, exclusive economic zones and&#13;
territorial seas of the Wider Caribbean, and thereby protecting the enviromnental&#13;
integrity of Caribbean coastal and marine systems.&#13;

ANNEX B&#13;
PROJECT DETAILS - ANTIGUA ANND BARBUDA&#13;
THE EXISTING SOLID WASTE MANAGElMENT SECTOR&#13;
The following sections provide a brief overview of the current conditions in the solid&#13;
waste management sector in Antigua and Barbuda.&#13;
Current Legislative and Policy Conditions&#13;
1.    The following waste management legislative and policy framework is currently&#13;
in place in Antigua and Barbuda:&#13;
The Public Health Act of 1957 is the Ministry's main legislative&#13;
vehicle, although it is outdated and does not provide any strong&#13;
controls or directions related to solid waste management (SWM) issues.&#13;
A Litter Act and associated regulations were enacted in 1983, although&#13;
the Act is not effectively enforced.&#13;
A Beach Control Act (1959) exists, which empowers the Minister to&#13;
make regulations to ensure the maintenance of sanitary conditions in the&#13;
areas concerned.&#13;
-     There is no solid waste management plan in place.&#13;
-     There is no land use plan in place for the country, and therefore no&#13;
development controls are in force to regulate SWM sites. A Spatial&#13;
Development Plan is presently being funded through UNDP.&#13;
Waste Generation&#13;
2.    Land-based solid waste generation has been estimated to amount to 210,000 m3&#13;
(about 36,500 tones) in Antigua, and 2,500 m3 (approximately 400 tones) in Barbuda&#13;
annually, although direct measurements of waste generation have not been undertaken.&#13;
Furthermnore, no data is available on the composition of these wastes. Exact figures&#13;
on solid waste landed at ports and harbors is unknown, but 1995 passenger arrivals&#13;
from cruise ships, yachts and cargo vessels are projected at about 275,000, 27,500&#13;
and 3,100 respectively, totalling approximately 315,600.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
Waste Disposal Facilities&#13;
3.    There are three existina waste disposal sites on Antigua and two on Barbuda.&#13;
The largest of these is Cook's (13 hectares), serving the parishes of St. John's, St.&#13;
Peter, St, George, St. Paul and half of St. Mary. The remainder of the parish of St.&#13;
Mary is served by the Old Road facility (5 hectares). The other facilities (Freetown&#13;
on Antigua, and Plantation and River on Barbuda) are all approximately 1 hectare&#13;
each. The only solid waste handling equipment available is a single bulldozer&#13;
operated on a part time basis at the Cook's site.&#13;
4.    Current operating costs of US576,000 are estimated for the Cook's facility,&#13;
and US$30,000 for the Old Road facility, with the operating costs for the other&#13;
facilities unknown. Capital costs expended for all facilities are also unknown.&#13;
Revenue generation through solid waste management charges is not undertaken for&#13;
any of these facilities.&#13;
5.    The Cook's facility sits on clav with small amounts of volcanic rock and sand.&#13;
The other sites all sit on sandy soils. Leachate and landfill gas control measures have&#13;
not been taken at any of the facilities, and no data are available on whether&#13;
groundwater or surface water has been impacted by the landfill sites, however a site&#13;
visit in April 1994 indicated leachate migration southwest of the Cook's site. In the&#13;
past, measures have not been taken to prohibit hazardous wastes from the facilities,&#13;
nor to control the potential for rodent/pest disease incidence or odor/dust/noise.&#13;
Recently, however, some operational improvements have been introduced at Cook's,&#13;
in an attempt to reduce negative environmental impacts. In addition, the site is large&#13;
and has the potential to provide many years of use. The land occupied by the Cook's&#13;
site is not government owned but is on long term lease.&#13;
6.    Fires burn continuously at the Cook's facility, daily at the Old Road facility&#13;
and periodically at the remaining facilities. Operations at the Cook's facility occur&#13;
daily and are undertaken by three staff. One staff person works at each of the&#13;
Freetown and Old Road facilities, but no staff are assigned to the facilities on&#13;
Barbuda.&#13;
7.    Three additional small waste disposal facilities operate on Barbuda. Two of&#13;
these, near Cocoa Point Lodge and K-Club, are for the exclusive use of these hotels.&#13;
The third facility is at Prebarie; no controls exist at this small facility, and&#13;
inforrnation is not available regarding its financial or environmental status.&#13;
8.    The Cook's facility has for some time been scheduled for upgrading, and the&#13;
Old Road and Freetown facilities will be closed when this occurs. Wastes currently&#13;
disposed of at the Old Road and Freetown facilities will be disposed of at the&#13;
upgraded Cook's facility. Estimates for upgrading of Cook's disposal site were&#13;
originally prepared by CEHI. These proposals and associated costs have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
modified under the currently proposed project. The upgraded site will cover 230&#13;
acres. A landfill liner was not included in the CEHI designs, however, and data were&#13;
not provided regarding other environmental and public health controls that might be&#13;
implemented.&#13;
9.    In Barbuda, the Plantation facility has for some time been scheduled for&#13;
upgrading once funds become available. When this facility is upgraded the River&#13;
facility will be closed. No information was available from government regarding the&#13;
project costs of the proposed Plantation facility upgrading, which has been included&#13;
and prepared under the proposed project.&#13;
Waste Collection&#13;
10.   The majority of wastes are hauled in packer trucks by the government except&#13;
for port wastes, which are either self hauled or hauled under private or other contract.&#13;
A small proportion of urban residential and industrial commercial and institutional&#13;
(IC&amp;I) wastes (estimated at 5 percent of each) are self-hauled. A small amount of&#13;
rural residential waste (estimated at 10 percent) and a larger amount of IC&amp;I waste&#13;
(estimated at 30 percent) is privately hauled under municipal contract. Curbside&#13;
collection of residential wastes is commonly undertaken, with residents using garbage&#13;
cans for in-home storage of wastes. Neighborhood depot collection of residential&#13;
wastes is also undertaken in Antigua, but not Barbuda. IC&amp;I wastes are stored in 10&#13;
yd3 skips, garbage bags and garbage cans in Antiaua, and in garbage cans and plastic&#13;
bags in Barbuda. Port wastes are mostly stored in box containers and hauled by&#13;
private contractors. A system has recently been introduced by the Parks Service at&#13;
English Harbor which involves storage of yacht waste in 20 cubic yard bins and their&#13;
removal by skip hoist vehicles.&#13;
11.   Night soil, hospital wastes, septic tank sludge and industrial hazardous wastes&#13;
are currently disposed of in municipal landfill facilities. There are no hospital&#13;
incineration facilities on Antigua and Barbuda.&#13;
12.   The number and type of collection vehicles operational, or capable of being&#13;
operational, in mid-1993 were as follows:&#13;
-     10 compactor vehicles (4 out of service)&#13;
-     1 skip truck (out of service)&#13;
-     4 flat-bed trucks (1 out of service)&#13;
-     1 tractor-drawn side loading trailer&#13;
Although the compactor vehicles are exclusively used in solid waste management&#13;
functions, the other vehicles are frequently used for other purposes thus reducing their&#13;
availability for solid waste collection activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
13.   Principle problems associated with the collection of wastes include:&#13;
narrow roads limit access to neighborhoods in Antigua; narrow and&#13;
unpaved roads limit delivery of service in Antigua and Barbuda;&#13;
inadequate collection equipment;&#13;
inadequate maintenance of vehicles as a result of shortage of parts&#13;
locally, insufficiently trained staff and shortage of service manuals.&#13;
This will become an increasingly severe problem since most waste&#13;
collection vehicles are over five years old;&#13;
-     a need for improved supervisory capability in Barbuda;&#13;
-     a need for improved technical staff capability;&#13;
-     a need for increased public awareness regarding the handling of wastes;&#13;
-     a need for reduction in the litter impact of bottles and cans, particularly&#13;
in Barbuda; and&#13;
-     the need for a strengthened instirutional framework and enhanced&#13;
revenue collection for the service.&#13;
Waste Processing&#13;
14.   There are currently no waste processing facilities on Antigua and Barbuda, and&#13;
none are planned, outside those proposed under this project.&#13;
Current Waste Management Responsibilities and Expenditures&#13;
15.   Responsibility for solid waste management falls under a section of the Ministry&#13;
of Health. This section both operates the collection system and manages the waste&#13;
disposal sites. In Barbuda the system is effectively operated by the local government.&#13;
Current waste management expenditures (1993) in Antigua and Barbuda total&#13;
ECS10.95 million, with wages and salaries accounting for EC$9.0 million. (This&#13;
high figure is accounted for by the fact that the budget includes approximately 700&#13;
laborers employed as street sweepers.)&#13;
Waste Recovery and Recycling&#13;
16.   Current arrangements for waste recovery and recycling are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
the public waste collection system services the residential areas, with a&#13;
limited amount of wastes being self-hauled;&#13;
the private sector provides most of the hauling service to the IC&amp;I&#13;
sector along with some collection provided by the public sector;&#13;
there are no formal or informal recycling programs on the island;&#13;
however, one or two companies have initiated individual programs to&#13;
reclaim products sold in their stores or manufactured by the company;&#13;
Battery Engineering Service and Sales has operated a cash-back&#13;
program for the past five years to reclaim old car batteries which are&#13;
shipped to Venezuela for processing;&#13;
a deposit system has been introduced for beer and King brand&#13;
beverages; and&#13;
government officials would like to target old corrugated cardboard and&#13;
plastic for recycling.&#13;
THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
The proposed project comprises the following elements.&#13;
Reception Facilities (Parts Al and A2 of the Project)&#13;
17.   A total of six ports will be provided with reception facilities for Annex V&#13;
wastes (generated either domestically or internationally). These are the major ports at&#13;
St. Johns and Heritage Quay (Part Al), and small craft harbors at Falmouth and&#13;
English Harbor on Antigua, and Codrington and Bay Harbor on Barbuda (Part A2).&#13;
A jetty will be provided adjacent to the Cook's site to facilitate direct barge transfer&#13;
of ship-generated waste from St John's to the site, thus avoiding the creation of&#13;
additional congestion in St John's due to transfer of ship-generated waste by truck.&#13;
Details of the facilities to be provided and their base costs are shown at tables B1 and&#13;
B2.&#13;
Storage and Collection System (Part B of the Project)&#13;
18.   To enhance the existing system for waste storage a total of 2,000 bins will be&#13;
acquired; 1,000 in 1995/96 and 1,000 in 1996/97. The existing collection system will&#13;
be enhanced by the purchase of five large and one small compactor vehicles in&#13;
1995/96 and two further large compactors in 1998. In addition a side-loading truck is&#13;
proposed to augment the collection system on Barbuda.(Table B3).&#13;

* To be acquired for Barbuda&#13;
Recycling (Part C of the Project)&#13;
19.   The development of recycling programs in Antigua (mainly for glass, metal,&#13;
aluminum and possibly for paper and plastics), has been shown to be economically&#13;
feasible. It is thus proposed to provide one Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in&#13;
Antigua (Table B4). Key projected revenue and cost data indicate that with a&#13;
conservative 40 per cent of colected IC&amp;I waste and 25 per cent of collected&#13;
residential waste recovered and recycled (4,300 tons in 1998), a total revenue of US$&#13;
196,000 per annum would be achievable by 1998. This revenue will (a) help defray&#13;
the cost of the collection and disposal system and (b) reduce by this quantity the waste&#13;
to be disposed of at the landfill site.&#13;
Waste Disposal (Part C of the Project)&#13;
20.   Upgrading of the Cook's landfill and closure of the other sites at Old Road and&#13;
Freetown on Antigua is proposed. In Barbuda, it is proposed to improve the&#13;
Plantation facility and close those at River and Paribie. The upgrading of Cook's&#13;
would include measures to provide leachate control, landfill gas control and erosion&#13;
and drainage control. Works would also include provision of access road, fencing&#13;
and other facilities. Leachate treatment would be provided in an oxidation pond&#13;
system. Total base cost of equipment for both the landfill sites (comprising one&#13;
bulldozer, two tracked loaders (one for Barbuda), a dump truck at each site, toxic&#13;
waste and oil storage facilities and other waste treatment and handling equipment&#13;
items) totals about US$1.067 million. A tire-shredding machine will be provided to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
reduce the volume occupied by tires at landfill sites and a stationary compactor will&#13;
be provided in Antigua for compaction of discarded vehicles (Table B4). Base costs&#13;
for civil works at both sites to be upgraded, and for the closure and rehabilitation of&#13;
the four existing sites which are to be closed total about US$560,000 and US$88,000&#13;
respectively (Table B4). The cost of site improvement and development at Cook's is&#13;
US$520,000 and at Pantation, Barbuda US$150,000. Closure and rehabilitation of the&#13;
sites at Old Road and Freetown in Antigua are estimated to cost US$76,000, and&#13;
those at River and Paribie on Barbuda US$12,000. The life of the Cook's site is&#13;
estimated at more than 25 years (with periodic further upgrading), and the Plantation&#13;
site should provide more than 15 years of use.&#13;
21.   The sites proposed for upgrading at Cook's and Plantation have been subject to&#13;
both detailed hydrogeological surveys and environmental imnpact assessments. These&#13;
have shown that (i) the sites are suitable for development as landfills and (ii) that&#13;
negative environmental impacts will be negligible provided that the mitigatory&#13;
measures proposed under the project are undertaken.&#13;
Disposal of Special Wastes (Part D of the Project)&#13;
22.   Equipment will be provided for the disposal of certain types of special waste.&#13;
In addition to those items to be located at the landfill site mentioned above, an&#13;
incinerator will be provided at the hospital in St. Johns for medical waste - total base&#13;
cost estimated at US$626,000 (Table B5).&#13;

Institutional Strengthening, Project Management and Monitoring (Part E of the&#13;
Project)&#13;
23.   Institutional strengthening will be achieved through establishment of a Solid&#13;
Waste Management Entity in Antigua and Barbuda and associated improvements in&#13;
solid waste management staff and training at a national and regional level. A key&#13;
element of the improved solid waste management system will be enhanced cost&#13;
recovery and revenue generation through the introduction of tipping fees on waste&#13;
disposed at the landfill sites and the levying of a waste management charge on visitors&#13;
to the islands. Project management, and the training and institutional support&#13;
elements of the project, are included as part of the Regional Component (Annex J).&#13;
In addition, two pick-ups will be procured to facilitate monitoring and management of&#13;
the new system. This component will also include technical assistance in the&#13;
identification and outline costing of projects to help address critical wastewater&#13;
collection, treatment and disposal problems (Table B6).&#13;
24.   It is proposed that once established, the new solid waste entity will seek to&#13;
maximize the involvement of the private sector in the solid waste management system.&#13;
Furthermore, assurances will be sought at loan negotiations that services will be&#13;
contracted out where cost efficient and beneficial to the solid waste management&#13;
entiry. In particular, in the case of Antigua and Barbuda, the new entity will not&#13;
inherit the 700 street sweepers who will either remain under the control of the&#13;
Ministry of Health or will be hired under a contractual arrangement.&#13;

Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
25.   Total project costs for Antigua and Barbuda including design and supervision,&#13;
physical and price contingencies and local taxes and duties are estimated to be US$&#13;
7.58 million. These additional costs are based on the following assumptions:&#13;
-     Design costs of 10% of civil works and 5% of equipment costs;&#13;
-     Supervision costs of 5 % of civil works and 3 % of equipment costs;&#13;
-     Physical contingencies of 15% for civil works, 5% for equipment and 10% for&#13;
project support activities;&#13;
-     Price contingencies at an average inflation rate for domestic and foreign prices&#13;
of 3.1% to the mid-point of construction or purchase.&#13;
-     Taxes and duties based on current rates for imported equipment and materials&#13;
and varying between 5 % and 70% of equipment base cost.&#13;
26.   Of the project components defined above the proposed financina plan is as&#13;
follows (Table B7):&#13;
-     The Global Environment Trust Fund will fund Parts Al, A2, C (items 3 and&#13;
4) and E (items 3 and 4) of the project net of taxes and duties at a total cost of&#13;
US$1.93 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
The European Investment Bank will fund Parts B, C (items 1,2, and 5-16), D,&#13;
and E (items 1 and 2) of the project net of taxes and duties at a total cost of&#13;
US$4.18 million.&#13;
The Government of Antigua and Barbuda will fund all taxes and duties&#13;
associated with parts A,B,C,D, and E of the project and the land associated&#13;
with part C of the Project i.e. item C17 at a total cost of US$1.47 million.&#13;

27.   Table B8 shows the projected costs and revenues for the improved solid waste&#13;
management systems for the first few years of its operation. The recurrent cost&#13;
stream includes both operating and maintenance costs and the annualized cost of&#13;
complete capital replacement of the system. The other assumptions made are&#13;
indicated in footnotes to the table.&#13;
28.   Cost recovery will primarily be achieved through (i) the continuation of&#13;
current central government subventions to the solid waste management system; (ii) the&#13;
levying of a tipping fee on all industrial, commercial and institutional wastes (at a rate&#13;
of US$20.00 per ton) and for transport and disposal of maritime waste (US$35.00 per&#13;
ton for haulage and US$40 per ton tipping fee), and (iii) the payment of an&#13;
environmental levy of US$1.50 by marine visitors and stayover tourists (see Table&#13;
B8). Based on these projections and the assumptions used, this table shows the solid&#13;
waste management system returning a sustained positive balance following project&#13;
implementation. This is primarily due to the high level of existing Government&#13;
subvention to the system, and the large number of tourists and marine visitors to&#13;
Antinua and Barbuda. Other sources of revenue e.g. from recycling should further&#13;
increase this surplus.  The details of revenue generation and cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms would be agreed and put in place prior to loan effectiveness.&#13;

Notes:&#13;
1.     Recurrent Cos( is as sliown in Ithe OECS Waste Manageinient Project Final Report.&#13;
2.     Current Governmenl Contribution is the 1993 government contribution to waste management inflated at 3.1 percent per year. Year I is&#13;
assumedl to be 1995.&#13;
3.     Inidustrial, commerciail andl instituitionial (IC&amp;I) lipping receipis arc calculaletl at $US 0 per ton in Year 1, $US 10 per ton in Year 2 andl&#13;
$US 20 per ton in Year 3 and following, inflated at a rate of 3.1 percent per year beginning in Year 2. It is assumed that 100 percent of&#13;
estimated IC&amp;I waste generated is delivered to landfill by either government or private haulers and that landfill tipping fee revenues from&#13;
this waste accrue to government.&#13;
4.     IC&amp;I llaul receipts are calculated on the basis that government performs contract halilage of 80 percent of the IC&amp;I waste generated and&#13;
receives the revenue associated with hauilage calctilated( in tlhe OECS Waste Management Project Final Report. Remaining IC&amp;] wasie is&#13;
assumed lo be hauled by the private sector without revenuLe to government. IC&amp;l waste collected/disposed of is assumed to grow at a rate&#13;
of 4.1 percent per year, reflecting recent average GDP growth rates in the OECS countries.&#13;
5.     The Marine Visilor and Stayover Visitor Levy is calculated on Iic basis of $US 1.50 per personi beginning midlway tlIrouigih year two of&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.      Marine Visilor llauil/Disposal is calculated on the lbasis of $75 per loi (a tipping fee of US$40 per toIn and an assumed transportation CoSt&#13;
of US$35 per ton) (inflated at 3.1 percent per year) as a regionlall chairge lor hliling/(lisposing these wastes lin(led in all OrCS countries.&#13;
7.      Stayover Visitor llaul/Disposal is calculated on the basis of tlhe landfill tippinig charge idenlified in Note 3, above, plus tlie haulage charge&#13;
calculated for the country. It is assumed that 80 percent of Iltese wastes will be hauled by government and that ihe private sector will&#13;
undertake remaining haulage.&#13;
8.      Marine Visitor and Stayover Visitor wastes are assumed to grow at 5 percent per year.&#13;
9.      Except as indicated, recurrent costs and revenies are assumed to be incurred over the whole year in which ilte cost or revenue item is&#13;
introduced.&#13;
10.    Additional revenue could be raised from ilte sale of recyclable materials, ilte levying of a tax on imported disposable materials andl&#13;
products, and a management fee levied on vehicles and appliances to provide for their management at the end of their life.&#13;

ANNEX C&#13;
PROJECT DETAILS - DOMINICA&#13;
THE EXISTING SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SECTOR&#13;
The following sections provide a brief overview of the current conditions in the solid&#13;
waste management sector in Dominica.&#13;
Current Legislative and Policy Conditions&#13;
1 .    The following legislative and policy framework is in place in Dominica:&#13;
A Litter Act was passed in 1990, to "make provision for the abatement&#13;
of nuisances caused by the littering of premises and public places and&#13;
for purposes connected therewith or incidental thereto" .' Its provisions&#13;
allow for the fining and/or incarcerating of persons littering in public&#13;
places or on private property. Responsibility for enforcement is given&#13;
to the police who may issue a ticket. In addition, under the Act,&#13;
derelict vehicles must be removed, subject to notice by the Minister of&#13;
Health. However, the Act remains largely un-enforced.&#13;
"No up-to-date standards or specifications have been established for the&#13;
construction and operation of solid waste dumps whose leachate may&#13;
contaminate surface and underground waters."2&#13;
The National Parks and Protected Areas Act (1975) gives authority to a&#13;
National Parks Advisory Council to, among others, "preserve their&#13;
[protected areas] natural beauty... "I This act also lacks enforcement.&#13;
The National Development Corporation Act (1988) enables the Minister&#13;
to empower the Corporation to make and enforce regulations that&#13;
promote Dominica as a tourism destination. It is noted by the&#13;
Caribbean Law Institute that, if overseen by the Minister in charge of&#13;
national parks, forestry, beach control, fisheries, etc., such a vehicle&#13;
could be used to enforce environmental concerns and legislation related&#13;
to tourism.&#13;

Ibid. p.165.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
While much of Dominica is privately owned, the Crown Lands&#13;
Ordinance enables Government to impose conditions on State lands and&#13;
to establish conditions for the reservation-of land required for public&#13;
purposes.&#13;
According to the Caribbean Law Institute, "the legislative infrastructure&#13;
for planning and development in Dominica appears to be quite adequate&#13;
for sound environmental management."4 It also cites the Town and&#13;
Country Planning Act, which authorizes preparation of regional, local&#13;
and sector-specific plans.&#13;
In practice, there is no national land use plan. However, "area plans"&#13;
are currently being prepared. The UNDP has provided funding for&#13;
plans at Soufriere/Scottshead, Portsmouth, Marigot and Roseau, all of&#13;
which contain strong environmental components. The Roseau Master&#13;
Plan, prepared several years ago, for example, identified the site at&#13;
Stock Farm currently being used as the main landfill site.&#13;
Waste Generation&#13;
2.    Approximately 10,000 tones of waste is reported to be collected annually in&#13;
Dominica; this has been projected to rise to 15,000 tones by year 2000 as collection&#13;
systems are developed to serve all regions of the country. Information on the&#13;
composition of these wastes is unavailable, and direct measurement of waste&#13;
generation has not been undertaken. Exact figures on solid waste landed at ports and&#13;
harbors is unknown, but 1995 passenger arrivals from cruise ships, yachts and cargo&#13;
vessels are projected at about 99,000, 9,900 and 1,100 respectively, totalling&#13;
approximately 110,000.&#13;
Waste Disposal Facilities&#13;
3.    Dominica is served by two waste disposal facilities: Stock Farm in Roseau,&#13;
and Portsmouth in the community of the same name. Little technical information is&#13;
available for either facility, but both are scheduled to be closed; a date for the closure&#13;
of these sites has not been established, but there are probably only two years' capacity&#13;
remaining at the Stock Farm site (i.e. it is anticipated that the existing facility will be&#13;
completely full by 1996).&#13;
4.    Stock Farm accepts at least twice as much waste as the Portsmouth facility.&#13;
Capital and operating costs are unknown for either site, but a budget of EC$40,000&#13;
annually is provided for the Stock Farm facility. Both facilities are located on sandy&#13;
soils; although no leachate or landfill gas control measures are in place at either site,&#13;
[bid. p. 159.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
no major negative impacts from either have been noticed although waste from the&#13;
almost-full Stock Farm site is washed onto the main road north from Roseau (and&#13;
thence into the sea) during periods of heavy rainfall.&#13;
5.    Operations at both landfills include periodic compaction of wastes and limited&#13;
daily cover is applied at the Stock Farm facility. Burning of wastes does not occur.&#13;
Dust from the access road to the Stock Farm facility is a problem and coats adjacent&#13;
vegetation and property.&#13;
6.    New waste disposal facilities are proposed by government for Fond Colet (near&#13;
the Stock Farm facility). The Fond Colet design, undertaken with support from&#13;
PAHO, includes provision of a clay liner, leachate control and landfill gas control. A&#13;
transfer station will be placed at the entrance gate for the deposition of self-hauled&#13;
wastes by private users. The terrain at Fond Colet is steep and hilly, and the&#13;
proposed waste disposal facility is located in a quarry which is still in operation.&#13;
7.    A decision on when to proceed with the Fond Colet site is subject to&#13;
availability of funding and resolution of concerns regarding aggregate removal from&#13;
the site. Most of the quarryable material available from the site has now been&#13;
removed.&#13;
Waste Collection&#13;
8.    Residential wastes are hauled by the government from neighborhood depots;&#13;
household and curbside pick-up does not occur. Some IC&amp;I wastes are also&#13;
municipally hauled and some self-hauled, but most are hauled under contract to either&#13;
the municipality or the private sector from 4, 6 or 8 yd3 containers. Port wastes are&#13;
hauled by the municipality from similar sized containers. Most waste collection is&#13;
conducted using skip trucks.&#13;
9.    Night soil and septic tank sludge are disposed of via sewer outfalls to the sea.&#13;
Hospital wastes and industrial hazardous wastes are disposed of in solid waste&#13;
disposal facilities.&#13;
10.   The number and type of collection vehicles operational, or capable of being&#13;
operational, in mid-1993 were as follows:&#13;
1 compactor vehicle&#13;
6 skip trucks&#13;
3 roll-off trucks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
11.   Principle problems associated with waste collection in Dominica are:&#13;
-     a need for additional collection equipment;&#13;
-     a need for improved maintenance and availability of spare parts;&#13;
-     a need for improved technical staff capability; and&#13;
-     a need for improved public awareness regarding the handling of wastes.&#13;
There are also significant problems associated with fragmentation of the institutional&#13;
framework for the service and the absence of effective cost recovery mechanisms.&#13;
Waste Processing&#13;
12.   There are currently no waste processing facilities in Dominica, and none are&#13;
planned outside those included in the proposed project.&#13;
Current Waste Management Responsibilities and Expenditures&#13;
13.   Current waste management expenditures in Dominica come from the Ministry&#13;
of Health (EC$0. 15 million per annum) and the Ministry of Communications and&#13;
Works (EC$0.907 million per annum). The Ministry of Health is responsible for&#13;
planning and management functions, and for the wages paid to two landfill attendants,&#13;
while the Ministry of Communications and Works is responsible for operations of the&#13;
collection system. This division of responsibilities contributes to inefficiencies in&#13;
operation and management of the system.&#13;
Waste Recovery and Recycling&#13;
14.   Current arrangements for waste recovery and recycling are as follows:&#13;
-     public waste collection system services the residential areas through use&#13;
of a skip system although no curbside pick-up occurs;&#13;
-     the private sector provides hauling service to IC&amp;I waste generators&#13;
along with some collection provided by the public sector;&#13;
-     there are no formal or informal recycling programs on the island with&#13;
the exception of a company that accepts empty Coca-Cola and Heineken&#13;
bottles; and&#13;
-     government officials would like to target various items (especially&#13;
bulky items such as tires) for recycling and reuse.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
The proposed project comprises the following elements.&#13;
Reception Facilities (Parts Al and A2 of the Project)&#13;
15.   A total of two major ports (four sites) and four small harbors will be provided&#13;
with reception facilities for Annex V wastes (generated either domestically or&#13;
internationally). These are the major ports at Portsmouth and Roseau, each of which&#13;
will be provided with reception facilities at two separate locations (Part Al), and the&#13;
small craft harbors at Anchorage, Cabrits Cruise Terminal, Purple Turtle Club and&#13;
Coconut Club (Part A2). Details of the facilities to be provided and their base costs&#13;
are shown at tables Cl and C2.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Transfer Stations (Part B of the Project)&#13;
16.   The use of transfer stations located initially at Marigot, Portsmouth and&#13;
Rosalie has been found to be cost-effective as compared to the direct haul of waste to&#13;
the proposed Fond Colet landfill site. Transfer stations will be provided at these&#13;
locations to serve the north and eastern coasts of the island. The equipment required&#13;
to support the transfer system comprises 20 twelve cubic yard skips served by two&#13;
roll-off vehicles to be purchased in 1995/96, with an additional vehicle to be&#13;
purchased in 1998 (Table C3).&#13;
Storage and Collection System (Part B of the Project)&#13;
17.   To enhance the existing storage system it is proposed to provide 1,000 garbage&#13;
carts and 70 five cubic yard skip bins, all for purchase in 1995/96. The former&#13;
would be served by three compactor trucks (1995/96 purchase), and the latter by two&#13;
skip-hoist vehicles to be purchased in 1995/96. For rural areas, two side-loading&#13;
vehicles are proposed for purchase in 1995/96 (Table C3).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Recycling (Part C of the Project)&#13;
18.   The development of recycling programs in Dominica (mainly for glass, metal,&#13;
aluminum and possibly for paper and plastics) can be economically feasible. It is thus&#13;
proposed to provide one Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in Dominica. Key&#13;
projected revenue and cost data indicate that with a conservative 40 per cent of&#13;
collected IC&amp;I waste and 25 per cent of collected residential waste recovered and&#13;
recycled (2,500 tons in 1998), a total revenue of US$115,000 per annum would be&#13;
achievable by 1998. This revenue will (a) help defray the cost of the collection and&#13;
disposal system and (b) reduce by this quantity the waste to be disposed of at the&#13;
landfill site.&#13;
Waste Disposal (Part C of the Project)&#13;
19.   Development of landfill capacity at Fond Colet is proposed to serve Dominica&#13;
in conjunction with transfer stations to minimize costs associated with waste haulage&#13;
(three in 1995 and a further two by 1998). The upgrading of the landfill site would&#13;
include measures to provide leachate control, landfill gas control and erosion and&#13;
drainage control. Works would also include provision of access road, fencing and&#13;
other facilities. Leachate treatment would be provided in an oxidation pond system.&#13;
Total capital base costs for equipment (bulldozer, waste oil and toxic waste storage&#13;
and other equipment) would be approximately US$615,200, and civil works using off-&#13;
site clay or artificial liner (no clay is available on-site), are estimated to be US$1.2&#13;
million. Total operating costs for the site are estimated at US$90,000 per annum.&#13;
The existing sites at stock Farm and Portsmouth are to be closed, covered and&#13;
rehabilitated at a cost of US$44,000. The new site is projected to have a lifetime of&#13;
at least 15 years.&#13;
20.   The site proposed for the new sanitary landfill at Fond Colet has been subject&#13;
to both detailed hydrogeological surveys and environmental impact assessment. These&#13;
have shown that (i) the site is suitable for development as a sanitary landfill and (ii)&#13;
that negative environmental impacts will be negligible provided that the mitigatory&#13;
measures proposed under the project are undertaken.&#13;
Disposal of Special Wastes (Part C of the Project)&#13;
21.   Equipment will be provided for the disposal of certain types of special waste.&#13;
A tire-shredding machine will be provided to reduce the volume occupied by tires at&#13;
landfill sites and a stationary compactor will be provided for vehicle disposal&#13;
(Table C4).&#13;

Institutional Strengthening, Project Management and Monitoring (Part E of the&#13;
Project)&#13;
22.   Institutional strengthening will be achieved through establishment of a Solid&#13;
Waste Management Entity in Dominica and associated improvements in solid waste&#13;
management staff and training at a national and regional level. A key element of the&#13;
improved solid waste management system will be enhanced cost recovery and revenue&#13;
generation through the introduction of tipping fees on waste disposed at the landfill&#13;
site and the levying of a waste management charge on visitors to the island. Project&#13;
management, and the training and institutional support elements of the project are&#13;
included as part of the Regional Component (detailed at Annex J). In addition, a&#13;
pick-up truck will be procured to facilitate monitoring and management of the new&#13;
system. This component will also include technical assistance in the identification of&#13;
projects to help address critical wastewater collection, treatment and disposal&#13;
problems to complement current initiatives in this sector in Dominica (Table C5).&#13;
23.   It is proposed that once established, the new solid waste entity will seek to&#13;
maximize the involvement of the private sector in the solid waste management system.&#13;
Furthermore, assurances will be sought at loan negotiations that services will be&#13;
contracted out where cost efficient and beneficial to the solid waste management&#13;
entity.&#13;

Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
24.   Total project costs for Dominica including design and supervision, physical&#13;
and price contingencies and local taxes and duties are estimated to be US$6.76&#13;
million. These additional costs are based on the following assumptions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
-     Design costs of 10% of civil works and 5% of equipment costs;&#13;
-     Supervision costs of 5% of civil works and 3% of equipment costs;&#13;
-     Physical contingencies of 15% for civil works, 5% for equipment and 10% for&#13;
project support activities;&#13;
-     Price contingencies at an average inflation rate for domestic and foreign prices&#13;
of 3.1 % to the mid-point of construction or purchase.&#13;
-     Taxes and duties based on current rates for imported equipment and materials&#13;
and varying between 5 % and 70% of equipment base cost.&#13;
25.   Of the project components defined above the proposed financing plan is as&#13;
follows (see also Table C6):&#13;
The Global Environment Trust Fund will fund Parts Al, A2, C (item 3), and&#13;
E (item 3) of the project net of taxes and duties at a total cost of US$1.46&#13;
million.&#13;
The World Bank, together with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), will&#13;
fund Parts B, C (items 1,2, and 4-11), and E (items 1 and 2) of the project&#13;
costing US$2.36 m equivalent (of which US$0.6 m IBRD, US$0.6 m IDA&#13;
equivalent and US$1.2 m CDB) net of taxes and duties.&#13;
The European Union would fund Part C (items 12 and 13) of the project net of&#13;
associated taxes and duties at a total cost of US$1.92 million.&#13;
* The Government of Dominica will fund all taxes and duties associated with&#13;
parts A,B,C, and E of the project and the land associated with part C at a total&#13;
cost of US$1.02 million.&#13;

26.   Table C7 shows the projected costs and revenues for the improved solid waste&#13;
management systems for the first few years of its operation. The recurrent cost&#13;
stream includes both operating and maintenance costs and the annualized cost of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
complete capital replacement of the system. The other assumptions made are&#13;
indicated in footnotes to the table.&#13;
27.   Cost recovery will primarily be achieved through (i) the continuation of&#13;
current central government subventions to the solid waste management system; (ii) the&#13;
levying of a tipping fee on all industrial, commercial and institutional wastes (at a rate&#13;
of US$20.00 per ton) and for transport and disposal of maritime waste (US$35.00 per&#13;
ton for haulage and US$40 per ton tipping fee), and (iii) the payment of an&#13;
environmental levy of US$1.50 by marine visitors and stayover tourists (see Table&#13;
C7). This table shows the solid waste management system consistently returning a&#13;
negative balance following project implementation. To avoid this deficit, additional&#13;
funds will need to be found either from central government, or from additional direct&#13;
or indirect revenue generation, if the system is to be sustainable in the long run, at&#13;
least until other sources of revenue (e.g. from recycling) are realized. Government is&#13;
considering the possibility of making a direct charge to households in order to help&#13;
defray the costs of the system. The details of revenue generation and cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms would be agreed and put in place prior to loan effectiveness.&#13;

ANNEX D&#13;
PROJECT DETAILS - GRENADA&#13;
THE EXISTING SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SECTOR&#13;
The following sections provide a brief overview of the current conditions in the solid&#13;
waste management sector in Grenada.&#13;
Current Legislative and Policy Conditions&#13;
1.    The waste management legislative and policy conditions which prevail in&#13;
Grenada are as follows:&#13;
The Abatement of Litter Act (1973), which includes provisions for&#13;
penalties of fines and imprisonment is the country's main law. It is&#13;
not, however, enforced.&#13;
The Public Health Law (1973;1981) includes a section on the "Disposal&#13;
of Refuse and Rubbish", which is requires updating to bring it into line&#13;
with current waste management activities.&#13;
For the most part, land use/environmental planning has not been&#13;
carried out to any degree in Grenada, with exceptions related in&#13;
particular to OAS-funded work in Grand Anse area and in the Inland&#13;
National Park area. Environmental issues are currently being handled&#13;
in a sectoral manner, with different miniistries responsible for different&#13;
resources. At present, planning activities are being carried out through&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture, mainly geared towards the preservation of&#13;
agricultural land. It is anticipated that these activities will form part of&#13;
an overall General Physical Development Plan for the country. No&#13;
specific land use policies and/or regulations currently exist with respect&#13;
to locating landfill sites.&#13;
Waste Generation&#13;
2.    Total waste generation has been estimated to amount to approximately 30,000&#13;
tones per year according to available documentation. A previous study (Luis Berger&#13;
1989) estimated that approximately 50 percent of waste was comprised of organic&#13;
material and 20 percent comprised of paper/paperboard, with glass and plastics&#13;
comprising the bulk of remaining wastes. No recent waste generation surveys have&#13;
been conducted to verify these estimates, however. Exact figures on solid waste&#13;
landed at ports and harbors is unknown, but 1995 passenger arrivals from cruise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
ships, yachts and cargo vessels are projected at about 209,600, 21,000 and 2,300&#13;
respectively, totalling approximately 232,900.&#13;
Waste Disposal Facilities&#13;
3.    Two waste disposal facilities serve Grenada. Both of these are operating as&#13;
open dumps and are scheduled to be closed at the time that upgraded waste disposal&#13;
capacity is commissioned.&#13;
4.    The larger of the two waste disposal sites (Perseverance) was estimated in&#13;
1988 to receive approximately 8,500 tons of material annually. The facility is&#13;
scheduled to be closed in its present configuration. The Ministry of Health, with the&#13;
assistance of consultants (Luis Berger, 1989 and PAHO, 1993) identified a preferred&#13;
new landfill site (Perseverance Estate) adjacent to the existing facility. However this&#13;
site includes the habitat of the endangered Grenada Dove, and an alternative site is&#13;
currentlv being identified through the revisiting of sites originally considered as&#13;
alternatives to the Perseverance site. The new site should ideally provide at least 25&#13;
years of capacity at projected rates of disposal.&#13;
5.     Little information is available regarding the financial costs and revenues of the&#13;
facility in its existing configuration, but site development capital costs of EC$7.0&#13;
million (1993 figures) were estimated to be required for the development of the new&#13;
facility by PAHO, who prepared a site development plan. However, this was&#13;
contingent upon the site also being used for quarrying.&#13;
6.     Environmental impacts reported at the existing site include gas and leachate&#13;
migration, litter, pest/rodent/disease potential and continuous fires. The site is now&#13;
almost full and remedial measures are required to include, among other things,&#13;
leachate control to reduce polluting leachate discharges to the Perseverance River.&#13;
7.     The second site (Telescope) receives approximately 40 percent of the amount&#13;
of material that is received at the Perseverance facility. No information is available&#13;
regarding either the financial costs or revenues (if any) of this waste disposal facility.&#13;
There is evidence of odor impact from the facility, as well as potential for&#13;
rodent/pest/disease incidence, but other environmental impacts are unknown. Initial&#13;
assessment of the site indicates potential for upgrading and use for about 10 more&#13;
years. However, tipping at this site is completely uncontrolled and it is the intention&#13;
of government to close the site.&#13;
8.    A number of additional potential new landfill site locations have been reviewed&#13;
in the past few years. Of these, a potential site adjacent to Telescope appeared to be&#13;
technically well suited for landfilling activity. However, the site is relatively distant&#13;
from St. Georges. Completion of a satisfactory environmental impact assessment at&#13;
the new Grenada site is a condition of effectiveness. Costs associated with developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
the new site or sites at other locations are not known, but are assumed to be similar to&#13;
those required for site development at Perseverance.&#13;
Waste Collection&#13;
9.     Urban residential wastes are generally collected from neighborhood depots and&#13;
hauled by the government to the disposal sites at Perseverance or Telescope. Rural&#13;
residential wastes are generally disposed of on the generators' property. Other wastes&#13;
(such as IC&amp;I wastes and ship generated wastes) are sometimes collected by&#13;
government but are frequently hauled under contract by a private hauler.&#13;
10.   The number and type of collection vehicles operational, or capable of being&#13;
operational, in mid-1993 were as follows:&#13;
4 compactor vehicles&#13;
1 flat-bed truck&#13;
In addition one flat bed truck operates in Carriacou.&#13;
11.   Principle problems associated with waste collection are:&#13;
-      lack of service equity between areas of the country,&#13;
-      insufficient equipment, and trucks are too large for rural areas;&#13;
-      rural areas lack provisions for bulky waste disposal;&#13;
-      inadequate truck maintenance;&#13;
need for improved management capability and enhanced cost recovery;&#13;
-      need for dedicated staff and improved staff technical capability&#13;
-      need for improved training opportunities; and&#13;
-      need for improved waste storage containers to prevent litter.&#13;
12.   Industrial hazardous waste and septic tank sludge is disposed of in municipal&#13;
landfill. Hospital wastes are incinerated at an existing facility.&#13;
Waste Processing&#13;
13.   No solid waste processing facilities currently exist in Grenada. The only&#13;
resource reutilization activities appear to be the scavenging of bottles at waste disposal&#13;
facilities. An energy-from-waste (EFW) facility has previously been proposed in&#13;
conjunction with the Perseverance Estate landfill, but this facility is not being&#13;
considered for implementation by government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Current Waste Management Responsibilities and Expenditures&#13;
14.   Current waste management expenditures are included in an Environmental&#13;
Health budget of EC$2.46 million, of which the solid waste budget is EC$1.8&#13;
million. Solid Waste Management is thus estimated to account for 73.5% of&#13;
government expenditures on Environmental Health. The Ministry of Health is&#13;
responsible for all aspects of the collection and disposal system.&#13;
Waste Recovery and Recycling&#13;
15.   Current arrangements for waste recovery and recycling are as follows:&#13;
-     public waste collection system services the residential areas but no&#13;
recycling programs have been inplemented;&#13;
-     the private sector generally collects wastes from hotels, commercial&#13;
establishments, and the industrial sector but does not offer collection of&#13;
recyclable materials;&#13;
-     a deposit/refund system for beer bottles does exist; and&#13;
-     some scavenging of bottles occurs at the waste disposal facilities.&#13;
THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
The proposed project comprises the following elements.&#13;
Reception Facilities (Parts Al and A2 of the Project)&#13;
16.   A total of one large port and six small craft harbors will be provided with&#13;
reception facilities for Annex V wastes (generated either domestically or&#13;
internationally). These are the major port at St. Georges (Part Al) and small craft&#13;
harbors at Grenada Yacht Services, Prickly Bay and Secret Harbor (Grenada) and&#13;
Hillsborough, Windwood Bay and Tyrell Bay (Carriacou) (Part A2). Details of the&#13;
facilities to be provided and their base costs are shown at tables Dl and D2.&#13;

Transfer Stations (Part B of the Project)&#13;
17.   A transfer station in Grenville (close to the Telescope disposal facility) has&#13;
been found to provide the most cost-effective means for transportation of wastes from&#13;
St. Patricks, St. Andrew and St. David on the east coast. The equipment required for&#13;
the system comprises one roll-off vehicle and four 43 cubic yard containers, all to be&#13;
procured in 1995/96.&#13;
Storage and Collection System (Part B of the Project)&#13;
18.   To enhance the existing storage system, a total of 3,000 garbage collection&#13;
containers will be procured (1,000 each in 1995, 1996, and 1997); in addition, fifteen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
skip bins will be purchased in 1995/96. To improve the collection system, it is&#13;
proposed to purchase three 10 cubic yard compactor trucks, a single skip hoist truck,&#13;
and for rural areas, two small (5 cubic yard) compaction vehicles, all in 1995/96; and&#13;
a further three large compaction vehicles in 1998. A side-loading vehicle is proposed&#13;
for Carriacou for purchase in 1995/96. (Table D3).&#13;

Recycling (Part C of the Project)&#13;
19.   The development of recycling programs in Grenada (mainly for glass, metal,&#13;
aluminum and possibly for paper and plastics) can be economically feasible. It is thus&#13;
proposed to provide one Material Recovery Facility (,MRF) in Grenada. Key&#13;
projected revenue and cost data indicate that with a conservative 40 per cent of&#13;
collected IC&amp;I waste and 25 per cent of collected residential waste recovered and&#13;
recycled (3,500 tons in 1998), a total revenue of US$160,000 per annum is achievable&#13;
by 1998 which will (a) help defray the cost of the collection and disposal system and&#13;
(b) reduce by this quantity the waste to be disposed of at the landfill site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Waste Disposal (Part C of the Project)&#13;
20.   The development of waste disposal capacity at a new site still to be determined&#13;
is recommended to serve Grenada. It is also proposed to provide a new solid waste&#13;
disposal facility at Dumfries on Carricou. The upgrading and construction of the&#13;
landfill sites would include measures to provide leachate control, landfill gas control&#13;
and erosion and drainage control. Works would also include provision of access&#13;
road. fencing and other facilities. Leachate treatnent would be provided in an&#13;
oxidation pond system at the site in Grenada, and by recirculation at Dumfries. Total&#13;
capital base costs associated with the development of the proposed Grenada site, and&#13;
the site at Dumfries are estimated at US$700,000 and US$200,000 respectively.&#13;
Landfill equipment (including a bulldozer and two tracked loaders (one for each site),&#13;
toxic waste and oil storage facilities etc), with a total base cost of US$987,000.&#13;
Operation of the facilities is projected to cost US$85,000 per annum. The existing&#13;
site at Perseverance would be covered and closed down, as would the other two&#13;
discontinued sites at Telescope (Grenada) and Hillsborough (Carriacou). These&#13;
closures are estimated to involve a base cost of US$55,000 (Table D4). The site at&#13;
Dumfries is estimated to be capable of providing volume for at least 20 years waste&#13;
disposal. A similar lifetime would be sought at the facility for Grenada.&#13;
21.    The site at Dumfries has been subjected to hydrogeological survey and an&#13;
environmental impact assessment. The site proposed for the new sanitary landfill will&#13;
also need to be subjected to both detailed hydrogeological surveys and environmnental&#13;
impact assessment. These will have to show that (i) the site is suitable for&#13;
development as a sanitary landfill and (ii) that negative environmental impacts will be&#13;
negligible provided that the mitigatory measures proposed under the project are&#13;
undertaken. In the case of the Dumfries site, the surveys and assessments have&#13;
shown the site to be suitable for development as a sanitary landfill.&#13;
Disposal of Special Wastes (Part C of the Project)&#13;
22.   Equipment will be provided for the disposal of certain types of special waste.&#13;
A tire-shredding machine will be provided to reduce the volume occupied by tires at&#13;
landfill sites and a stationary compactor will be provided for disused vehicle&#13;
compaction (included in above costing for equipment at the disposal site).&#13;

Institutional Strengthening, Project Management and Monitoring (Part E of the&#13;
Project)&#13;
23.   Institutional strengthening will be achieved through establishment of a Solid&#13;
Waste Management Entity in Grenada and associated improvements in solid waste&#13;
management staff and training at a national and regional level. A key element of the&#13;
improved solid waste management system will be enhanced cost recovery and revenue&#13;
generation through the introduction of tipping fees on waste disposed at the landfil1&#13;
sites and the levying of a waste management charge on visitors to the islands. Project&#13;
management, and the training and institutional support elements of the project are&#13;
included as part of the Regional Component. In addition, two pick-ups will be&#13;
procured to facilitate monitoring and management of the new system. This&#13;
component will also include technical assistance in the identification, evaluation and&#13;
preparation of projects to help address critical wastewater collection, treatment and&#13;
disposal problems in Grenada (Table B5).&#13;
24.   It is proposed that once established, the new solid waste entity will seek to&#13;
maximize the involvement of the private sector in the solid waste management system.&#13;
Furthermore, assurances will be sought at loan negotiations that services will be&#13;
contracted out where cost efficient and beneficial to the solid waste management&#13;
entity.&#13;

Establishment of a Sanctuary for the Grenada Dove (Part F of the Project)&#13;
25.   The discovery of the Grenada Dove at the proposed landfill site at&#13;
Perseverance Estate has served to increase the awareness of Government and the&#13;
international community over the plight of the dove. In response to this, Government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
has declared the ridges of Mount Hartman a protected area for the Grenada Dove. To&#13;
support this effort under the project, the GEF has agreed to provide grant funds of up&#13;
to USS200,000 to complement the efforts of Government in establishing the proposed&#13;
sanctuary. This support will take the form of the provision of physical protection&#13;
works and technical assistance in the development of institutional arrangements for&#13;
management of the protected area. Details of this component will be finalized by&#13;
government and agreed with the Bank/GEF prior to fund disbursement.&#13;
Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
26.   Total project costs for Grenada including design and supervision, physical and&#13;
price contingencies and local taxes and duties are estimated to be US$7.96 million.&#13;
These additional costs are based on the following assumptions:&#13;
-     Design costs of 10% of civil works and 5% of equipment costs;&#13;
-     Supervision costs of 5 % of civil works and 3 % of equipment costs;&#13;
-     Physical contingencies of 15% for civil works, 5% for equipment and 10% for&#13;
project support activities;&#13;
-     Price contingencies at an average inflation rate for domestic and foreign prices&#13;
of 3. 1% to the mid-point of construction or purchase.&#13;
-     Taxes and duties based on current rates for imported equipment and materials&#13;
and varying between 5 % and 70% of equipment base cost.&#13;
27.   Of the project components defined above the proposed financing plan is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
The Global Environment Trust Fund will fund Parts Al, Al, C (items 3 and&#13;
4) and E (items 3 and 4) of the project net of taxes and duties at a total cost of&#13;
US$2.36 million.&#13;
The European Investment Bank will fund Parts B, C (items 1 and 2), and E&#13;
(items 1 and 2) of the project net of taxes and duties at a total cost of US$2.15&#13;
million.&#13;
The Caribbean Development Bank will fund Part C (items 5-15) of the project&#13;
net of associated taxes and duties at a total cost of US$1.70 million.&#13;
The Government of Grenada will fund all taxes and duties associated with&#13;
parts A,B,C, and E of the project and the land associated with part C and local&#13;
costs associated with part F (Sanctuary for the Grenada Dove) at a total cost of&#13;
US$1.75 million.&#13;

28.   Table D7 shows the projected costs and revenues for the improved solid waste&#13;
management systems for the first few years of its operation. The recurrent cost&#13;
stream includes both operating and maintenance costs and the annualized cost of&#13;
complete capital replacement of the system. The other assumptions made are&#13;
indicated in footnotes to the table.&#13;
29.   Cost recovery will primarily be achieved through (i) the continuation of&#13;
current central government subventions to the solid waste management system; (ii) the&#13;
levying of a tipping fee on all industrial, commercial and institutional wastes (at a rate&#13;
of USS20.00 per ton) and for transport and disposal of maritime waste (US$35.00 per&#13;
ton for haulaae and US$40 per ton tipping fee), and (iii) the payment of an&#13;
environmental levy of US$1.50 by marine visitors and stayover tourists (see Table&#13;
D7). Based on these projections and the assumptions used, this table shows the solid&#13;
waste management system returning a sustained positive balance following project&#13;
implementation. Other sources of revenue e.g. from recycling should further increase&#13;
this surplus. However, despite this, Government is keen to see further reductions in&#13;
its subventions to the system by considering the possibilities for raising additional&#13;
funding by levying a direct charge on households of ECS7.50 per month, to be paid&#13;
with the electricity bill. The details of revenue generation and cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms would be agreed and put in place prior to loan effectiveness.&#13;

ANNEX E&#13;
PROJECT DETAILS - ST. KITTS AND NEVIS&#13;
THE SOLID WASTE MANAGENEiNT SECTOR&#13;
THE EXISTING SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SECTOR&#13;
The following sections provide a brief overview of the current conditions in the solid waste&#13;
management sector in St. Kitts and Nevis.&#13;
Current Legislative and Policy Conditions&#13;
1.    As noted by the Caribbean Law Institute in its Environmental Laws of the&#13;
Caribbean, "Much of this (St. Kitts and Nevis) environmental legislation is out-dated. "' A&#13;
review of legislation relevant to solid waste management is briefly reported below:&#13;
-     The Public Health Act: Under the Act. power is given to the Minister&#13;
of Health who can delegate such power to local councils and&#13;
authorities. While it covers methods of removal and disposal of waste,&#13;
penalties are low and enforcement is inadequate.&#13;
The Litter (Abatement) Act: The Act, which is considered to be&#13;
comprehensive2 restricts littering and enables the appointment of Litter&#13;
Wardens but again, penalties are considered to be inadequate.&#13;
Regulations have not been sufficiently comprehensively enacted to&#13;
fulfill implementation of the Act. It was noted frequently in both&#13;
St.Kitts and Nevis during field visits that there is a reluctance on the&#13;
part of the twenty litter wardens to fine lirterers. It was also noted by a&#13;
senior government official that there is a precedent in the country for&#13;
the successful prosecution of violators of sand mining regulations and&#13;
that a concerted effort to induce litter wardens to levy fines is required.&#13;
Southeast Peninsula Land Development and Conservation Board Act:&#13;
Currently, the Board responsible for overseeing the newly opened-up&#13;
Southeast Peninsula does not have the capability to collect waste and&#13;
has asked hotel developers to engage private haulers. While the Board&#13;
Act provides for the levying of significant fines, enforcement, again, is&#13;
cited as an issue. In addition, the Board is advisory in nature and is&#13;
Caribbean Law Insuiute. Environmental Laws in I/IC Caribbean: Country Profiles: St. Christopher and Nevis. p. 260.&#13;
Ibid. p. 273.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
not, under current legislation, empowered to take a hands-on&#13;
management function. Finally, no solid waste regulations have been&#13;
enacted in this regard.&#13;
National Conservation and Environmental Protection Act: Enacted in&#13;
1987, the Act has been essentially dormant as a result of a lack of&#13;
financial capacity for implementation. A Conservation Commission has&#13;
been attempting to establish an implementation secretariat.&#13;
There are no national land use plans, zoning by-laws or development&#13;
control authorities to, for example, designate future landfill sites.&#13;
Furthermore, planning controls are not rigorously enforced.&#13;
Waste Generation&#13;
2.     Waste generation and composition data have not been generated for St. Kitts&#13;
and Nevis. For purposed of analysis, they are assumed to be similar to those&#13;
recorded for other OECS countries. Exact figures on solid waste landed at ports and&#13;
harbors is unknown, but 1995 passenger arrivals from cruise ships, yachts and cargo&#13;
vessels are projected at about 69,300 6,900 and 800 respectively, totalling&#13;
approximately 77,000.&#13;
Waste Disposal Facilities&#13;
3.    Waste disposal facilities at Conaree and Round Hole serve St. Kitts. The&#13;
facility at Conaree serves the south and east of the island, including Basseterre.&#13;
Round Hole serves the north and west of the island. Both facilities are currently&#13;
scheduled to remain open, although the government is unable to control the tipping at&#13;
the round hole site.&#13;
4.    The facility at Conaree covers about two hectares. The site is publically&#13;
owned and a total area of about 10 hectares is available. No capital costs were&#13;
reported for the facility; operating costs are unknown beyond the wages (EC$156.40&#13;
per week) paid to the single staff person who works at the facility. The soils at the&#13;
facility are silty sands which overlie volcanic rock. There is currently a threat of&#13;
leachate contamination of adjacent wetlands which are sprayed periodically to control&#13;
insects. No other environmental controls are in place. No data are available&#13;
regarding leachate and landfill gas impacts, although no major problems have been&#13;
identified in this regard. Wastes are not compacted or covered and odor, litter and&#13;
flies are present. The facility is unfenced and uncontrolled scavenging takes place.&#13;
Indiscriminate burning of wastes also occurs. The facility is located within&#13;
approximately 1 km. of the Golden Rock residential area and the airport.&#13;
5.    The Round Hole facility is estimated to cover about 0.5 hectares, and is part&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
of a larger publically owned estate. The facility is unstaffed and information is not&#13;
available concerning capital and operating costs of the facility. Wastes are not&#13;
covered or compacted and there are no environmental controls in place at the facility.&#13;
Odor, litter and flies are predominant and the access road is long and in very poor&#13;
condition. The facility is unfenced and uncontrolled scavenging takes place.&#13;
Indiscriminate burning of wastes also occurs. The facility is upwind of a residential&#13;
area approximately 1.5 kms away.&#13;
6.    The government anticipates that the existing waste disposal facilities can serve&#13;
the island's needs for at least 15 years, provided that the operation of the facilities can&#13;
be upgraded.&#13;
7.    Nevis is served by waste disposal facilities at Low Ground and Indian Castle,&#13;
neither of which is currently scheduled for closure. Both facilities are estimated to be&#13;
less than 0.5 hectares in size and to be underlain with clay that contains boulders.&#13;
Wastes remain uncovered and uncompacted, and are burned daily. Odor, litter and&#13;
large numbers of flies were noted during visits to each facility. Scavenging occurs at&#13;
both sites. The Indian Ground facility is located within 0.2 kms of a recreational area&#13;
and is located in an area of outstanding natural beautv.&#13;
8.    In the summer of 1993, GTZ undertook a study which recommended the&#13;
upgrading of waste disposal facilities and waste management infrastructure for St.&#13;
Kitts and Nevis. This study was used in the preparation of these proposals.&#13;
Waste Collection&#13;
9.    Most residential wastes in St. Kitts are hauled by the government, while most&#13;
IC&amp;I and ports wastes are hauled under private contract. Some self-hauling of wastes&#13;
also occurs from all sources of waste generation except ports. In contrast, in Nevis&#13;
residential and ports wastes are generally collected under municipal contract. IC&amp;I&#13;
wastes are collected under private contract. Some self-hauling of rural residential and&#13;
IC&amp;I wastes also occurs.&#13;
10.   On both islands, curbside collection of residential wastes is undertaken in both&#13;
urban and rural locations. Neighborhood depots are also used for all types of&#13;
residential waste in St. Kitts, but only for urban residential wastes in Nevis. On both&#13;
islands, garbage cans and plastic bags are commonly used to store wastes in the&#13;
home. Packer trucks are used for the collection of wastes on both islands; pick-up&#13;
trucks, other light trucks or vans are also used, particularly in St. Kitts.&#13;
11.   Night soil is not collected on either island. Septic tank sludge in St. Kitts is&#13;
hauled to a pit at the Conaree disposal facility, where it is treated with lime; in Nevis,&#13;
septic tank sludge is usually buried on the owner's property. Data is unavailable on&#13;
the collection/disposal of industrial hazardous wastes; however, no restrictions on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
these materials are in place at the existing waste disposal facilities. Hazardous and&#13;
pathogenic hospital wastes on Nevis are burned in an on-site concrete enclosure.&#13;
12.   The number and type of collection vehicles operational, or capable of being&#13;
operational, in mid-1993 were as follows:&#13;
For St Kitts:&#13;
2 compactor vehicles&#13;
4 flat-bed trucks&#13;
4 roll-top trucks&#13;
For Nevis:&#13;
1 roll-top truck&#13;
13.   Principle waste collection problems noted in St. Kitts are:&#13;
inadequate numbers of collection vehicles;&#13;
insufficient maintenance for vehicles, which is an increasingly severe&#13;
problem since all collection vehicles are over five years old; and&#13;
a need for improved technical staff capabilities.&#13;
14.   Other significant problems noted include the difficulty of accessing rural areas&#13;
on poor and narrow roadways, a need for equipment more suitable to the demands&#13;
placed on it, improved capability to plan and manage solid waste management systems&#13;
and improved co-operation on the part of residents with waste collection schedules&#13;
and requirements.&#13;
15.   Principle waste collection problems noted in Nevis are:&#13;
-     the poor access to rural neighborhoods as a result of poor and narrow roads;&#13;
-     the need for a new waste collection vehicle;&#13;
-     a need for improved training opportunities; and&#13;
-     poor condition of neighborhood and other storage containers.&#13;
16.   In both St. Kitts and Nevis there is an urgent need for improved management&#13;
of the collection system, and for the issue of cost recovery to be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Waste Processing&#13;
17.   There are no waste processing facilities in St Kitts and Nevis, and none are&#13;
planned except those proposed under this project.&#13;
Current Waste Management Responsibilities and Expenditures&#13;
18.   The waste management system for St Kitts and Nevis is operated and&#13;
maintained by the Ministry of Health. Solid waste budgets of St Kitts are included in&#13;
a range of other costs, which makes it difficult to identify the specific costs for waste&#13;
management. The Chief Public Health Inspector estimates that total annual&#13;
expenditures are about EC$750,000 for all aspects of waste management on St. Kitts&#13;
including operations, salaries of Ministry staff, wages, vehicle operating costs etc.&#13;
19.   Total budget for Nevis is EC$479,000, including 25 percent of four regional&#13;
health inspectors at EC$20,000 per year. Major cost items are private sector&#13;
contracts (EC$350,000) and salaries and wages (EC$110,000). The remaining item is&#13;
equipment maintenance, for which expenditures are very low.&#13;
Waste Recovery and Recycling&#13;
20.   Current arrangements for waste recovery and recycling are as follows:&#13;
the public waste collection system services the residential areas, with a&#13;
limited amount of wastes being self-hauled;&#13;
the private sector provides most of the hauling service to the IC&amp;I&#13;
sector along with some collection provided by the public sector; and&#13;
there are no formal or informal recycling programs on the island,&#13;
although deposits are paid on some beer and soft drink bottles.&#13;
THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
The proposed project comprises the following elements.&#13;
Reception Facilities (Parts Al and A2 of the Project)&#13;
21.   A total of five ports will be provided with reception facilities for Annex V&#13;
wastes (generated either domestically or internationally). These are the major ports at&#13;
Basseterre, St Kitts (two sites) and Charlestown, Nevis (Part Al), and the small craft&#13;
harbors at South Frigate Bay, Ballast Bay and South Friars Bay (St. Kitts) and&#13;
Pinneys Beach and Cades Bay (Nevis) (Part A2). Details of the facilities to be&#13;
provided and their base costs are shown at tables El and E2.&#13;

Transfer Stations&#13;
22.   Transfer stations have not been found to be cost-effective in either St. Kitts or&#13;
Nevis.&#13;
Storage and Collection System (Part B of the Project)&#13;
23.   To enhance the existing storage system in St. Kitts it is proposed to purchase&#13;
1,500 plastic garbage carts and 20 six cubic yard bulk bins all in 1995/96. These&#13;
will be served by two new ten cubic yard compactor trucks and two side loader trucks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
respectively, all to be purchased in 1995/96, with a further two trucks to be&#13;
purchased in 1998. A pick-up truck will also be purchased for collection from&#13;
inaccessible areas. In Nevis, it is proposed to purchase two compactor trucks serving&#13;
500 plastic garbage carts and one pick-up to be used for collection in areas with poor&#13;
access, all in 1995/96. The proposed additions to the storage and collection systems&#13;
are shown in table E3.&#13;

TOTAL                                                      982,000&#13;
Recycling (Part C of the Project)&#13;
24.   The development of recycling programs in St. Kitts and Nevis (mainly for&#13;
glass, metal, aluminum and possibly for paper and plastics) can be economically&#13;
feasible in the longer term. It is thus initially proposed to provide one Material&#13;
Recovery Facility (MRF) in St. Kitts. Key projected revenue and cost data indicate&#13;
that with a conservative 40 per cent of collected IC&amp;I waste and 25 per cent of&#13;
collected residential waste recovered and recycled (1,400 tons in 1998), a total&#13;
revenue of US$65,000 per annum is achievable which will (a) help defray the cost of&#13;
the collection and disposal system and (b) reduce by this quantity the waste to be&#13;
disposed of at the landfill site.&#13;
Waste Disposal (Part C of the Project)&#13;
25.   Development of recommendations for waste disposal in St. Kitts and Nevis are&#13;
based on the outcome of work recently completed by GTZ to identify and prepare&#13;
plans for the upgrading of waste disposal facilities in St. Kitts and Nevis. The&#13;
proposals involve the upgrading of the existing facilities at Lowground (Nevis) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Conaree (St. Kitts). The likely capacity of these facilities is 15 years and 22 years&#13;
respectively. The upgrading would include measures to provide leachate control,&#13;
landfill gas control and erosion and drainage control. Works would also include&#13;
provision of access road, fencing and other facilities. Leachate treatment would be&#13;
provided by recirculation. Landfill compaction equipment in the form of a bulldozer&#13;
would be provided for Conaree and small trackloaders would be provided for multi-&#13;
purpose use at both Conaree and Lowground. Other equipment including a dump&#13;
truck, waste oil and hazardous waste storage facility will also be provided at the&#13;
Conaree site. A tire-shredding machine will be provided to reduce the volume&#13;
occupied by tires at landfill sites and a stationary compactor will be provided for&#13;
disused vehicle compaction (Table E4). The base cost of the proposed improvements&#13;
at Conaree are US$375,000 for civil works and US$621,000 for equipment.&#13;
Equivalent costs for the Lowground facility are US$500,000 and US$297,000&#13;
respectively. The existing facilities at Round Hole (St. Kitts) and Indian Castle&#13;
(Nevis) will be closed and rehabilitated at a base cost of US$30,000. Total operating&#13;
costs of the disposal systems will be US$100,000 per annum for Conaree and&#13;
US$85,000 per annum for Lowground.&#13;
26.   The sites proposed for upgrading to sanitary landfills at Conaree and&#13;
Lowground have been subject to both detailed hydrogeological surveys and&#13;
environmental impact assessment. These have shown that (i) both sites are suitable&#13;
for development as a sanitary landfill and (ii) that negative environmental impacts will&#13;
be negligible provided that the mitigatory measures proposed under the project are&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
Disposal of Special Wastes (Part D of the Project)&#13;
27.   Equipment will be provided for the disposal of certain types of special waste.&#13;
Some of these are included as part of the disposal equipment mentioned above. In&#13;
addition, an incinerator will be provided at the hospital in Basseterre for medical&#13;
waste disposal at a base cost of US$586,000 (Table E5).&#13;

Institutional Strengthening, Project Management and Monitoring (Part E of the&#13;
Project)&#13;
28.   Institutional strengthening will be achieved through establishment of a Solid&#13;
Waste Management Entity in St. Kitts and Nevis and associated improvements in solid&#13;
waste management staff and training at a national and regional level. A key element&#13;
of the improved solid waste management system will be enhanced cost recovery and&#13;
revenue generation through the introduction of tipping fees on waste disposed at the&#13;
landfill sites, and the levying of a waste management charge on visitors to the islands.&#13;
Project management, and the training and institutional support elements of the project&#13;
are included as part of the Regional Component. In addition, two pick-up trucks will&#13;
be procured to facilitate monitoring and management of the new system. This&#13;
component will also include technical assistance in the identification and preparation&#13;
of projects to help address critical wastewater collection, treatment and disposal&#13;
problems (Table E6).&#13;
29.   It is proposed that once established, the new solid waste entity will seek to&#13;
maximize the involvement of the private sector in the solid waste management system.&#13;
Furthermore, assurances will be sought at loan negotiations that services will be&#13;
contracted out where cost efficient and beneficial to the solid waste management&#13;
entity.&#13;

Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
30.   Total project costs for St. Kitts and Nevis including design and supervision,&#13;
physical and price contingencies and local taxes and duties are estimated to be US$&#13;
7.54 million. These additional costs are based on the following assumptions:&#13;
-     Design costs of 10% of civil works and 5% of equipment costs;&#13;
-     Supervision costs of 5% of civil works and 3% of equipment costs;&#13;
-     Physical contingencies of 15% for civil works, 5% for equipment and 10% for&#13;
project support activities;&#13;
-     Price contingencies at an average inflation rate for domestic and foreign prices&#13;
of 3. 1 % to the mid-point of construction or purchase.&#13;
-     Taxes and duties based on current rates for irnported equipment and materials&#13;
and varying between 5% and 70% of equipment base cost.&#13;
31.   Of the project components defined above the proposed financing plan is as&#13;
follows (Table E7):&#13;
-     The Global Environment Trust Fund will fund Parts Al, A2, C (items 3 and&#13;
4), and E (items 3 and 4) of the project net of taxes and duties at a total cost&#13;
of US$1.92 million.&#13;
-     The World Bank will fund Parts B, D, and E (items 1 and 2) of the project net&#13;
of taxes and duties (IBRD funds) at a total cost of US$2.13 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
The Caribbean Development Bank will fund Part C (items 1, 2, and 5-13) of&#13;
the project net of taxes and duties at a total cost of US$1.91 million.&#13;
The Govermment of St. Kitts and Nevis will fund all taxes and duties&#13;
associated with parts A,B,C,D, and E of the project and the land associated&#13;
with part C of the Project i.e. Part C17 at a toEal cost of US$1.58 million.&#13;

32.   Table E8 shows the projected costs and revenues for the improved solid waste&#13;
management systems for the first few years of its operation. The recurrent cost&#13;
stream includes both operating and maintenance costs and the annualized cost of&#13;
complete capital replacement of the system. The other assumptions made are&#13;
indicated in footnotes to the table.&#13;
33.   Cost recovery will primarily be achieved through (i) the continuation of&#13;
current central government subventions to the solid waste management system; (ii) the&#13;
levying of a tipping fee on all industrial, commercial and institutional wastes (at a rate&#13;
of USS20.00 per ton) and for transport and disposal of maritime waste (US$35.00 per&#13;
ton for haulage and US$40 per ton tipping fee), and (iii) the payment of an&#13;
environmental levy of US$1.50 by marine visitors and stayover tourists (see Table&#13;
E8). This table shows the solid waste management system consistently returning a&#13;
negative balance following project implementation. To avoid this deficit, additional&#13;
funds will need to be found either from central government, or from additional direct&#13;
or indirect revenue generation, if the system is to be sustainable in the long run, at&#13;
least until other sources of revenue (e.g. from recycling) are realized. Government is&#13;
considering the possibility of making a direct charge to households in order to help&#13;
defray the costs of the system. The details of revenue generation and cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms would be agreed and put in place prior to loan effectiveness.&#13;

I.     Recurrent Cost is as showin in file OECS Waste Managemenit lProjecl Fiical Report.&#13;
2.     Current Government Contribution is the 1993 government contribution to waste management inflated at 3.1 percent per year. Year I is&#13;
assumed to be 1995.&#13;
3.    Industrial, commercial and institutional (IC&amp;I) lipping receipts are calculated at $US 0 per ton in Year 1, $US 10 per ton in Year 2 and&#13;
$US20.00 per ton in Year 3 and following, inflated at a rate of 3.1 percent per year beginning in Year 2. It is assumed that 100 percent&#13;
of estimated IC&amp;[ waste generated is delivered to landfill by either government or private haulers and that landfill tipping fee revenues&#13;
from this waste accrue to government.&#13;
4.    IC&amp;I Haul receipts are calculated on the basis that government performs contract haulage of 80 percent of the IC&amp;I waste generated and&#13;
receives the revenue associated with haulage calculated in the OECS Waste Management Project Final Report. Remaining IC&amp;I waste is&#13;
assumed to be hauled by the private sector without revenue to government. IC&amp;I waste collected/disposed of is assumed to grow at a rate&#13;
of 4.1 percent per year, reflecting recent average GDP growth rates in the OECS countries.&#13;
5.     The Marine Visitor and Stayover Visitor Levy is calculated on the basis of $US 1.50 per person beginning midway through year two of&#13;
the project.&#13;
6.     Marine Visitor Haul/Disposal is calculated on the basis of $75 per ton (a tipping fee of US$40 per ton and an assumed transportation cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of US$35 per (on) (inflated at 3.1 percent per year) as a regional charge for hauling/tdisposing these wastes landed in all OECS countries.&#13;
7.     Stayover Visitor Hlaul/Disposal is calculated on the basis of the landfill tipping charge identified in Note 3, above, plus the haulage charge&#13;
calculated for the country. It is assumed that 80 percent of these wastes will be hauled by government and that the private sector will&#13;
undertake remaining haulage.&#13;
8.     Marine Visitor and Stayover Visitor wastes are assumed to grow at 5 percent per year.&#13;
9.      Except as indicated, recurrent costs and revenues are assumed to be incurred over the whole year in which the cost or revenue item is&#13;
introduced.&#13;
10.    Additional revenue could be raised from the sale of recyclable materials, the levying of a tax on imported disposable materials and&#13;
products, and a management fee levied on vehicles and appliances to provide for their management at the end of their life.&#13;

ANNEX F&#13;
PROJECT DETAILS - ST. LUCIA&#13;
THE EXISTING SOLID WASTE MANAGEMIENT SECTOR&#13;
The following sections provide a brief overview of the current conditions in the solid&#13;
waste management sector in St. Lucia.&#13;
Current Legislative and Policy Conditions&#13;
1 .    The following waste management legislative and policy conditions prevail in&#13;
St. Lucia:&#13;
- The Public Health Act (1975) authorizes the Minister of Health and Local&#13;
Government to make regulations related to waste and public health. This Act&#13;
focuses on promoting and protecting the health of the population and addresses&#13;
waste as an aspect of public health management rather than as an&#13;
environmental issue with implications for public health '. Under this Act,&#13;
Local Authorities may be delegated the duties and power of enforcement&#13;
within their jurisdictions2. Public Health Nuisances Regulations (1978) are the&#13;
principal policy regulating the collection of garbage.&#13;
- The Litter Act (1983) is the principal Act governing the enforcement of the&#13;
proper disposal of solid waste in public places. A Litter Amendment Bill&#13;
(1993) has been proposed to address deficiencies in existing regulation and its&#13;
enforcement. This Amendment proposes licensing private sector transportation&#13;
of garbage, regulations controlling the transportation and storage of solid&#13;
waste, and regulations for the disposal of derelict vehicles. Provision is made&#13;
for enforcement through Litter Prevention Wardens who are authorized to&#13;
enforce the act, and have the power of arrest. Every member of the police&#13;
force, and especially appointed Environmental Health Officers, Public Health&#13;
Inspectors and Forestry Officers will become Litter Prevention Wardens.&#13;
Penalties range from EC$500 to $2,000 or six months in jail. The Prime&#13;
Minster in the budget address of April 1993 reaffirrned the Government's&#13;
intention to strictly enforce the Litter Act3.&#13;
- Local Authorities Ordinance Chapter 239 provides for establishing Bye-&#13;
Laws for suppression and abatement of nuisances.&#13;
Caribbean Law Institure. Environmental Laws of the Commonwealth Caribbean. 1991&#13;
p. 293 - 295.&#13;
Public Health Act No 8 of 1975(6) p. 48.&#13;
Ibid.. The Weekend Voice. May 1 1993 p. 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
- The Fisheries Act (1984) provides for the prosecution of polluters to&#13;
beaches and coastal areas. Enforcement is provided through the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, Department of Fisheries. The Parks and Beaches Commission&#13;
has the statutory responsibility for the development and maintenance of public&#13;
places including parks and beaches. It has important functions in the&#13;
enforcement of legislation related to illegal waste disposal.&#13;
- A National Physical Development Strategy was drafted in June 1990 exists,&#13;
but is seldom referred to. This document outlines a land- use strategy that&#13;
conserves and protects the natural environment and provides for sustainable&#13;
urban development. The latest National Development Plan is over 10 years&#13;
old and is outdated.&#13;
- The Development Control Authority (DCA) is a management body&#13;
responsible for overseeing development activity on the island, and as such&#13;
plays a potential critical role in land use planning.&#13;
Waste Generation&#13;
2.    Residential waste generation has been measured at between 0.45 kg/person/day&#13;
and 0.60 kg/person/day. Over 50 percent of residential waste has been measured to&#13;
comprise organic materials; with paper/paperboard (16 percent), plastics (nine&#13;
percent) and glass (seven percent) comprising the majority of the remaining materials.&#13;
GTZ have estimated, based on limited measurements, that waste generation from&#13;
places of employment amounts to 0.43 kg/person/day in major commercial centers.&#13;
GTZ have also considered waste generation from places of employment in other&#13;
regions of the country to amount to 0.25 kg/person/day.&#13;
3.    Exact figures on solid waste landed at ports and harbors is unknown, but 1995&#13;
passenger arrivals from cruise ships, yachts and cargo vessels are projected at about&#13;
152,700, 15,300 and 1,700 respectively, totalling approximately 169,700.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
Waste Disposal Facilities&#13;
4.    Six waste disposal sites are currently being operated by local goverrnents in&#13;
St Lucia. The Ciceron facility, serving Castries and Gros Islet, receives an average&#13;
of 52.6 tons of waste daily. The other facilities are smaller; the Vieux Fort facility&#13;
receives an estimated average of 15 tons of waste daily, and the remaining facilities&#13;
between approximately one and two tons of material daily.&#13;
5.    Five of these (Ciceron, Micoud, Dennery, Anse La Raye and Choiseul) were&#13;
scheduled to be closed as soon as possible, as of April 1993. By mid 1993, Micoud&#13;
and Dennery had both been closed and wastes are now hauled directly to Vieux Fort.&#13;
The waste disposal facility at Vieux Fort will remain open, and recommendations&#13;
have been made for the upgrading of this facility. In addition, the St. Lucia&#13;
government has decided to proceed with the acquisition of property for the&#13;
development of new landfill capacity to replace the facility at Ciceron which is poorly&#13;
located and operated. The new site is to be identified to serve the entire northern&#13;
portion of the island.&#13;
6.    Environmental control measures have generally not been implemented at any&#13;
of the existing waste disposal facilities. Groundwater impacts have occurred at&#13;
Ciceron because groundwater level at high tide is at the base of the facility; rapid&#13;
movement of leachate and consequent impacts on Cul-de-Sac Bay are suspected.&#13;
Similarly, the close proximity of the base of the Vieux Fort facility to sea level may&#13;
result in contamination of groundwater if protection measures are not taken. At&#13;
Micoud, waste is pushed into the sea; this has been found to affect the breeding&#13;
habitat of fish in the area. No data is available on ground and surface water impacts&#13;
at the Anse La Raye and Choiseul sites.&#13;
7.    Wastes are burned at Ciceron and Vieux Fort; wastes are burned weekly at&#13;
Anse La Raye and Choiseul. Wastes are compacted and covered occasionally at&#13;
Ciceron and Vieux Fort, but not at Micoud, Dennery or Choiseul. At all these&#13;
facilities, however, odor is evident and at most facilities there is evidence of pests,&#13;
litter and dust.&#13;
8.    The new waste disposal facilities proposed in the north of the island will&#13;
receive almost 100 tons of waste per day from the municipalities of Castries, Gros&#13;
Islet, Anse La Raye and Canaries. Leachate control measures will be taken in the&#13;
design of the site, and daily cover will be applied to the wastes. Difficulty has&#13;
already been experienced in locating a suitable site in an undeveloped area which&#13;
should be adjacent to the heavily urbanized north east region of the island. The&#13;
terrain of these locations is hilly and rocky. Adequate access will also have to be&#13;
provided. The Ministry of Health, CEHI and GTZ have been involved in the effort&#13;
to identify a site for these facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
Waste Collection&#13;
9.    Most wastes are collected by the municipalities. Virtually all remaining wastes&#13;
are collected by the private sector under municipal contract or are self-hauled,&#13;
although some IC&amp;I wastes are collected under private contract.&#13;
10.   Urban residential wastes are mostly collected from the curb. Neighborhood&#13;
communal bins and depots are also used for residential waste storage prior to&#13;
collection in urban and rural areas, and some urban residential wastes are self-hauled.&#13;
A variety of containers are used to store wastes at the point of generation in both&#13;
residential settings and places of employment. An exception is at ports, where all&#13;
existing containers are 10 cubic yard skips.&#13;
11.   Compaction trucks and skip trucks are generally used to collect urban&#13;
residential and IC&amp;I wastes. A variety of other vehicles are also used by private&#13;
haulers except at ports, where skip trucks are used.&#13;
12.   Industrial hazardous wastes and hospital wastes are typically disposed of&#13;
untreated at solid waste disposal facilities.&#13;
13.   The number and type of collection vehicles operational, or capable of being&#13;
operational, in mid-1993 were as follows:&#13;
-     9 compactor vehicles&#13;
-     7 flat-bed trucks&#13;
-     5 skip trucks&#13;
-      1 roll-top truck&#13;
Most of these vehicles were operated by the Castries City Council, with a few being&#13;
operated by the local authorities at Vieux Fort and at Micoud and Denery.&#13;
14.   Principle problems associated with the collection of wastes are as follows:&#13;
- collection vehicles are not specified for steep slopes common in St. Lucia,&#13;
thus only partial loads can be delivered to landfill sites;&#13;
- collection vehicle maintenance is severely impeded by lack of spare parts&#13;
and money earmarked for maintenance. This is likely to become an&#13;
increasingly important issue since all vehicles (with one exception) are over&#13;
five years old;&#13;
- an overly decentralized structure for managing wastes that results in&#13;
fragmentation in the management of wastes at the expense of the sharing of&#13;
available resources;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
- a need for improved technical staff capability and training opportunities; and&#13;
- inadequate servicing of storage containers, resulting in waste overflowing&#13;
onto the street, particularly in Castries.&#13;
Waste Processing&#13;
15.   There are no waste processing facilities on St. Lucia and none are currently&#13;
planned, outside those proposed under this project.&#13;
Current Waste Management Responsibilities and Expenditures&#13;
16.   The waste collection system in St. Lucia is operated by local governments&#13;
under the overall supervision of the Ministry of Health. Current waste management&#13;
expenditures in St. Lucia are estimated at EC$1.74 million per annum.&#13;
Waste Recovery and Recycling&#13;
17.   Current arrangements for waste recovery and recycling are as follows:&#13;
- a few private haulers collect waste or recyclable materials;&#13;
- no formal or informal recycling programs exist that target the residential or&#13;
IC&amp;I sector; and&#13;
- there is extremely limited informal economic activity to collect waste&#13;
discards for resale. Due to its high value, some copper is collected at the&#13;
landfill for resale and beer bottles and liquor bottles are collected for deposit&#13;
refund. Also, it has been observed that some aluminum cans are collected at&#13;
the local landfills and sent to Trinidad for recycling.&#13;
THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
The proposed project comprises the following elements.&#13;
Reception Facilities (Part Al and A2 of the Project)&#13;
18.   A total of five ports will be provided with reception facilities for Annex V&#13;
wastes (generated either domestically or internationally). These are the major ports at&#13;
Castries and Vieux Fort and the small craft harbors at Soufriere, Rodney Bay and&#13;
Marigot Bay. Details of the facilities to be provided and their base costs are shown at&#13;
tables Fl and F2.&#13;

Transfer Stations&#13;
19.   The economic feasibility of the use of transfer stations on St Lucia has been&#13;
found to be only marginal and so none are proposed.&#13;
Storage and Collection System (Part B of Project)&#13;
20.   The existing storage system will be improved by the provision of 3,000 plastic&#13;
garbage bins and 60 skip bins all to be purchased in 1995/96. To enhance the&#13;
existing collection system, and to service these storage bins and skips, it is proposed&#13;
to purchase a total of eight 10 cubic yard and four 5 cubic yard compactor trucks (all&#13;
5 cubic yard trucks and two 10 cubic yard trucks in 1995/96 and the remainder in&#13;
1998), and five skip-hoist trucks also in 1998. In addition two side-loading trucks&#13;
will be purchased (in 1995/96) to collect wastes from areas with poor access (Table&#13;
F3).&#13;

Recycling (Part C of Project)&#13;
21.   The development of recycling programs in St. Lucia (mainly for glass, metal,&#13;
aluminum and possibly for paper and plastics) can be economically feasible. It is thus&#13;
proposed to provide one Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in St. Lucia. Key&#13;
projected revenue and cost data indicate that with a conservative 40 per cent of&#13;
collected IC&amp;I waste and 25 per cent of collected residential waste recovered and&#13;
recycled (8,000 tons in 1998), a total revenue of US$450,000 per annum is achievable&#13;
at that time. This will (a) help defray the cost of the collection and disposal system&#13;
and (b) reduce by this quantity the waste to be disposed of at the landfill site.&#13;
Waste Disposal (Part C of Project)&#13;
22.   The upgrading of existing waste disposal capacity in Vieux Fort to serve the&#13;
south of the country and development of new landfill capacity (currently planned at&#13;
Cul-de-sac) to serve the north of the country is proposed. The upgrading of the&#13;
Vieux Fort site and the new construction at Cul-de-sac or alternative appropriate site&#13;
would include measures to provide leachate control, landfill gas control and erosion&#13;
and drainage control. Works would also include provision of access roads, fencing&#13;
and other facilities. Leachate treatment will be provided in an oxidation pond system.&#13;
The existing site serving the north of the island at Ciceron, and other sites still being&#13;
used at Micoud, Dennery, Anse La Raye and Choiseul would be closed and covered.&#13;
Base costs associated with the upgrading of the Vieux Fort facility are estimated to be&#13;
US$450,000 for capital civil works, US$475,000 for equipment (bulldozer, tracked&#13;
loader and other associated equipment) and US$70,000 per annum for operating costs.&#13;
Preliminary estimates associated with the development of waste disposal facilities at&#13;
Cul-de-sac indicate base costs of US$1,000,000 for capital works (assuming liner has&#13;
to be provided), US$752,000 for equipment (bulldozer, tracked loader, dump truck&#13;
and other associated equipment including facilities for storage of waste oil and toxic&#13;
waste) and US$90,000 per annum for operating costs. Phased development of the site&#13;
at Vieux Fort can provide at least 20 years of operation. A similar life would be&#13;
sought at the proposed Cul-de-sac site. The proposed closure and restoration of sites&#13;
at Ciceron, Micoud, Dennery Anse La Raye and Choiseul is anticipated to involve&#13;
base costs of US$50,000 (Table F4).&#13;
23.   The site proposed for upgrading to sanitary landfill at Vieux Fort has been&#13;
subject to both detailed hydrogeological surveys and environmental impact&#13;
assessment. These have shown that (i) the site is suitable for development as a&#13;
sanitary landfill and (ii) that negative environmental impacts will be negligible&#13;
provided that the mitigatory measures proposed under the project are undertaken.&#13;
Similar surveys and assessments are to be undertaken for the proposed new landfill at&#13;
Cul-de-sac to confirm its suitability for use as a sanitary landfill.&#13;

Institutional Strengthening, Project Management and Monitoring (Part E of the&#13;
Project)&#13;
25.   Institutional strengthening will be achieved through establishment of a Solid&#13;
Waste Management Entity in St Lucia and associated improvements in solid waste&#13;
management staff and training at a national and regional level. A key element of the&#13;
improved solid waste management system will be enhanced cost recovery and revenue&#13;
generation through the introduction of tipping fees on waste disposed at the landfill&#13;
sites and the levying of a waste management charge on visitors to the islands. Project&#13;
management, and the training and institutional support elements of the project are&#13;
included as part of the Regional Component. In addition, two pick-ups will be&#13;
procured to facilitate monitoring and management of the new system. This&#13;
component will also include technical assistance in the identification and preparation&#13;
of projects to help address critical wastewater collection, treatment and disposal&#13;
problems (Table B6).&#13;
26.   It is proposed that once established, the new solid waste entity will seek to&#13;
maximize the involvement of the private sector in the solid waste management system.&#13;
Furthermore, assurances will be sought at loan negotiations that services will be&#13;
contracted out where cost efficient and beneficial to the solid waste management&#13;
entity.&#13;

Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
27.   Total project costs for St Lucia including design and supervision, physical and&#13;
price contingencies and local taxes and duties are estimated to be US$10.70 million.&#13;
These additional costs are based on the following assumptions:&#13;
- Design costs of 10% of civil works and 5% of equipment costs;&#13;
- Supervision costs of 5% of civil works and 3 % of equipment costs;&#13;
- Physical contingencies of 15% for civil works, 5% for equipment and 10%&#13;
for project support activities;&#13;
- Price contingencies at an average inflation rate for domestic and foreign&#13;
prices of 3. 1% to the mid-point of construction or purchase.&#13;
- Taxes and duties based on current rates for imnported equipment and&#13;
materials and varying between 5% and 70% of equipment base cost.&#13;
28.   Of the project components defined above the proposed financing plan is as&#13;
follows (Table B7):&#13;
- The Global Environment Trust Fund will fund Parts Al, A2, C (items 3 (1&#13;
unit], 4 [1 unit] and 5) and E (items 3 and 4) of the project net of taxes and&#13;
duties at a total cost of US$2.45 million.&#13;
- The World Bank will fund Parts B, C (items 1, 2, 3 [1 unit], 4 [1 unit] and&#13;
6-12), D, and E (items 1 and 2) of the project (50% IBRD and 50% IDA) net&#13;
of taxes and duties at a total cost of US$4.56 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
- The Caribbean Development Bank will fund Part C (items 13 and 14) of the&#13;

- The Government of St Lucia will fund all taxes and duties associated with&#13;
parts A,B,C,D, and E of the project and the land associated with part C of the&#13;
Project i.e. Part C17 at a total cost of US$1.73 million.&#13;

29.   Table F8 shows the projected costs and revenues for the improved solid waste&#13;
management systems for the first few years of its operation. The recurrent cost&#13;
stream includes both operating and maintenance costs and the annualized cost of&#13;
complete capital replacement of the system. The other assumptions made are&#13;
indicated in footnotes to the table.&#13;
30.   Cost recovery will primarily be achieved through (i) the continuation of&#13;
current central government subventions to the solid waste management system; (ii) the&#13;
levying of a tipping fee on all industrial, commercial and institutional wastes (at a rate&#13;
of US$20.00 per ton) and for transport and disposal of maritime waste (US$35.00 per&#13;
ton for haulage and US$40 per ton tipping fee), and (iii) the payment of an&#13;
environmental levy of US$1.50 by marine visitors and stayover tourists (see Table&#13;
F8). This table shows the solid waste management system returning a negative&#13;
balance following project implementation. To avoid this deficit, additional funds will&#13;
need to be found either from central government, or from additional direct or indirect&#13;
revenue generation, if the system is to be sustainable in the long run, at least until&#13;
other sources of revenue (e.g. from recycling) are realized. Government is&#13;
considering the possibilities for raising additional funding such as levying a direct&#13;
charge on households in order to help defray the costs of the system. The details of&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX G&#13;
PROJECT DETAILS - ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES&#13;
THE EXISTING SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SECTOR&#13;
The following sections provide a brief overview of the current conditions in the solid waste&#13;
management sector in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.&#13;
Current Legislative and Policy Conditions&#13;
1 .    The following waste management legislative and policy conditions prevail in St.&#13;
Vincent and the Grenadines:&#13;
As with the other countries in the region, St. Vincent and the Grenadines has a&#13;
number of laws that are relevant to environmental protection, although most&#13;
are outdated and inappropriate.&#13;
The Public Health Act (1977) enables the government to deal with solid and&#13;
liquid wastes, including the issuing of statutory notices to abate nuisances and&#13;
the prosecution of offenses. "Since no regulations have been made to guide&#13;
inspectors in their enforcement duties, reliance has to be placed on the&#13;
substantive provisions of the Act to ensure compliance with its provisions,&#13;
which are deficient in terms of specificity, thereby compromising the&#13;
effectiveness of the enforcement process"'.&#13;
In 1991, a new Litter Act was passed, allowing for fines and jail terms to be&#13;
imposed on offenders. However, overall, solid waste management is suffering&#13;
from an absence of clearly stated national goals and objectives, whereby&#13;
effective planning and management is not possible2.&#13;
St. Vincent and the Grenadines does not have in place any national land use&#13;
plans. The country is in the initial stages of developing Spatial/Land Use&#13;
Plans, funded through UNDP. An Environmental Action Plan is in the&#13;
preparation process with the assistance of the World Bank. The Town and&#13;
Country Planning Act (1976) enables the government to take action on the&#13;
development of illegal structures in the country.&#13;
Physical Planning Department representatives noted that from a planning&#13;
Enviroranental Laws of the Commonwealth Canbbean", p.313.&#13;
2     lbid, p. 315.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
perspective, siting of a new landfill is a difficult proposition both in St.&#13;
Vincent and the Grenadines. To find a suitable location that is removed from&#13;
human settlements, not near other incompatible land uses, such as agricultural&#13;
areas, water courses, etc., and accessible by vehicles, is not easy given the&#13;
geography and developmental history of the country. An integrated planning&#13;
approach is required to resolve these issues and identify a site that is suitable&#13;
over the long term, and to protect it from encroachment by other uses at a&#13;
later date.&#13;
Environmental matters are primarily dealt with in the Ministry of Education&#13;
and Health, although no specific legislation exists to guide environmental&#13;
management activities and there is no division, or complement of staff, to deal&#13;
with this sector.&#13;
Waste Generation&#13;
2.     Approximatelv 50,000 tons of waste is estimated to be generated annually in St.&#13;
Vincent and the Grenadines. These estimates have not been verified through direct&#13;
measurement of waste generation. Furthermore, no measurements have been made of the&#13;
waste composition, although it is assumed that these are similar in all the OECS countries.&#13;
Exact figures on solid waste landed at ports and harbors is unknown, but 1995 passenger&#13;
arrivals from cruise ships, yachts and cargo vessels are projected at about 79,700, 8,000 and&#13;
900 respectively, totalling approximately 88,600.&#13;
Waste Disposal Facilities&#13;
3.     Six waste disposal facilities serve the major population on St. Vincent and the&#13;
Grenadines: Amos Vale (serving Kingstown and region), Chili (serving the Georgetown&#13;
area), Wallilabou (serving the Barrouallie area), Fitz-Hughes (serving the Chateaubelair&#13;
area), Raintree (serving Bequia Island) and Clifton (serving Union Island). Arnos Vale,&#13;
Chili and Clifton disposal sites are scheduled to be closed. The other sites are not well&#13;
managed but are not scheduled for immediate closure.&#13;
4.     Financial data on these sites is not readily available. Costs are unknown and no&#13;
revenue generating mechanisms are associated with these facilities.&#13;
5.     Each of these facilities is known to be underlain by sandy soils, except Raintree and&#13;
Clifton, which have a clay/sand soil base. No controls are in place to manage leachate or&#13;
landfill gas at any of the sites. It is likely that leachate is entering surface water adjacent to&#13;
the Chili facility; this water is used by residents for washing. Similarly, it is considered&#13;
likelv that leachate from the Barrouallie and Raintree sites is entering streams adjacent to&#13;
these facilities. The base of the Amos Vale site is at sea level and close to the shore line,&#13;
which is likely to result in the rapid migration of leachate into the marine environment.&#13;
Furthermore it is close to the airport and presents a potential hazard to air traffic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
6.     Wastes are occasionally covered and compacted at the Arros Vale and Raintree sites&#13;
(once a month and once every three or four months respectively). Burning of wastes occurs&#13;
at all sites, generally on a daily basis. Offensive dust, odor and litter are reported to affect&#13;
the school, airport and industries adjacent to the Arnos Vale facility. Children bathing in the&#13;
river adjacent to the Chili facility are reported to play with garbage that falls into the river.&#13;
Odor, litter, dust and flies are present at each facility. Amos Vale, Chili and Wallilabou&#13;
facilities are staffed, and a bulldozer is based at Amos Vale.&#13;
7.     There are government proposals for the Amos Vale site to be replaced by a facility in&#13;
Diamond, and the Clifton site to be replaced by a facility known as the Campbell site. A&#13;
new site at Peter's Hope in Barrouallie has also been identified. However, operational plans&#13;
have not been developed for these facilities as yet, although it is reported that an initial EC$&#13;
600,000 has been budgeted for the Campbell facility.&#13;
Waste Collection&#13;
8.     Urban residential waste is mostly municipally collected from the curb, where residents&#13;
place it in wheeled tote carts; some wastes are also collected from neighborhood depots.&#13;
Rural residential waste is either municipally collected, hauled from the curb or neighborhood&#13;
depots or, more frequently, self-hauled. Only 62 percent of residents are reported to have&#13;
access to waste collection services. However, the majoritv of those who do not have access&#13;
to collection services are living in rural areas. IC&amp;I waste is either municipally collected,&#13;
collected under private contract or self hauled. Port wastes are mostly privately collected,&#13;
although some municipal collection of these wastes also occurs. Compactor trucks, skips,&#13;
roll tops and open dump trucks are all used to haul wastes.&#13;
9.    iNight soil and septic tank sludge are disposed of at the Arnos Vale facility; the use of&#13;
other facilities for the disposal of these wastes is unclear. The destination of hazardous&#13;
wastes collected from the IC&amp;I sector is also unclear, but controls are not in place to prevent&#13;
these wastes from being disposed of in existing solid waste disposal facilities. Hospital&#13;
wastes are incinerated at the Kingstown General Hospital, and needles and other potentially&#13;
hazardous materials are disposed of at the disposal site after incineration.&#13;
10.   The number and type of collection vehicles operational, or capable of being&#13;
operational, in mid-1993 in St Vincent and the Grenadine Islands were as follows:&#13;
3 compactor vehicles&#13;
3 flat-bed trucks&#13;
5 roll-top trucks&#13;
11.   Principle problems identified regarding waste collection are as follows:&#13;
-      some rural districts receive no waste collection due to a shortage of collection&#13;
vehicles;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
poor road conditions limit the access of waste collection vehicles in some&#13;
areas;&#13;
funds and parts available for maintenance are inadequate. Some vehicles have&#13;
been out of service for years waiting for maintenance to be performed;&#13;
increased technical staff capability is required; and&#13;
increased emphasis should be placed on technical considerations in the&#13;
allocation of funds for waste management.&#13;
Waste Processing&#13;
12.   No waste processing facilities exist in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and none are&#13;
planned except those included in the proposed project.&#13;
Current Waste Management Responsibilities and Expenditures&#13;
13.   Sold waste management is the overall responsibility of the Ministry of Health, with&#13;
elements of the system also being operated by the Ministry of Community Development and&#13;
Local Government. Current waste management expenditures total about EC$ 3.54 million,&#13;
with the Ministry of Health and Environment accounting for EC$2.45 million, and the&#13;
Ministry of Community Development and Local Government for EC$1.09 million.&#13;
Waste Recovery and Recycling&#13;
14.   Current arrangements for waste recovery and recycling are as follows:&#13;
residential wastes are primarily collected bv the public sector in urban areas,&#13;
although part of the system is contracted out; in the rural areas, some wastes&#13;
are collected from the curbside or neighborhood depots, but most are self-&#13;
hauled;&#13;
-     IC&amp;I wastes are collected either by the private or public sectors; some self-&#13;
hauling occurs as well;&#13;
there are no formal or infornal recycling programs taking place;&#13;
-     a deposit system has been implemented for beer bottles; and&#13;
-     beverage cans are prohibited from sale on the island.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
The proposed project comprises the following elements.&#13;
Reception Facilities (Parts Al and A2 of the Project)&#13;
15.   A total of seven ports will be provided with reception facilities for Annex V wastes&#13;
(generated either domestically or internationally). These are the major ports at Kingstown,&#13;
St. Vincent and small craft harbors at Wallilabou Bay, Young Island and Blue Lagoon (St.&#13;
Vincent), Admiralty Bay and Friendship Bay in Bequia, and Charleston Bay in Canaouan&#13;
(facilities for Clifton Harbor in Union Island are to be provided under a separate initiative).&#13;
Details of the facilities to be provided and their base costs are shown at tables GI and G2.&#13;

16.   Transfer stations have been demonstrated to be marginal in economic terms and&#13;
consequently are not proposed under the project.&#13;

Storage and Collection System (Part B of the Project)&#13;
17.   To enhance the existing storage and collection system, it is proposed to purchase&#13;
4,000 plastic refuse storage bins served by five 10 cubic yard capacity compaction trucks and&#13;
eight 5 cubic yard compaction trucks. All of this equipment will be purchased in 1995/96&#13;
except for three of the larger compaction trucks which will be purchased in 1999. In&#13;
addition, 30 skips served by two skip-hoist vehicles will be purchased in 1996, and four side-&#13;
loading vehicles for use in more remote areas will also be purchased in 1996. Of this&#13;
equipment, one small compactor and one side-loader will be used on each of Bequia and&#13;
Canouan (Table G3). An alternative source of funding has been made available for the&#13;
implementation of solid waste management improvements in Union Island which is&#13;
consequently not included in this project.&#13;

Recycling (Part C of the Project)&#13;
18.   The development of recycling programs in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (mainly for&#13;
glass, metal, aluminum and possibly for paper and plastics) can be economically feasible. It&#13;
is thus proposed to provide one Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in St. Vincent. Key&#13;
projected revenue and cost data indicate that with a conservative 40 per cent of collected&#13;
IC&amp;I waste and 25 per cent of collected residential waste recovered and recycled (5,700 tons&#13;
in 1998), a total revenue of US$250,000 per annum is achievable at that time. This will (a)&#13;
help defray the cost of the collection and disposal system and (b) reduce by this quantity the&#13;
waste to be disposed of at the landfill site (Table G4).&#13;
Waste Disposal (Part C of the Project)&#13;
19.   The establishment of modem waste disposal capacity at the Brighton location on St.&#13;
Vincent, as recommended by PAHO, is proposed under the project. The development of an&#13;
additional site at Wallilabou on St. Vincent and at Springhill Estate on Bequia and at Taffia&#13;
Bay on Canouan are also included at the request of the St. Vincent government.&#13;
Brighton&#13;
20.   The capital base costs of the proposed Brighton facility including required equipment&#13;
(bulldozer, tracked loader, waste oil and toxic waste storage facility and other associated&#13;
equipment) total US$750,000 for civil works and US$767,000 for equipment, with operating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
costs amounting to an estimated US$95,000 per annum. The site has an estimated life of&#13;
more than 20 years.&#13;
Wallilabou&#13;
21.   The landfill to be located in Wallilabou will serve northeast St. Vincent and may&#13;
accept inert materials from the south of the island. The landfill will be small and will be&#13;
similar to the landfills described for the Grenadine Islands below, in its operational and&#13;
financial characteristics. It will have a design life of 20 years. Base costs are anticipated to&#13;
comprise US$150,000 for civil works and US$250,000 for equipment (primarily a tracked&#13;
loader).&#13;
Grenadine Islands&#13;
22.   The option selected for managing the wastes generated on the Grenadine Islands&#13;
involves managing waste on the major outlying islands individually.&#13;
23.   The estimated quantities of waste generated in the Grenadines are shown below:&#13;
Island                Generation Rate           Per cent Organic or&#13;
(tones/day)               Putrescible&#13;
Bequia                7.5                       50%&#13;
Union Island*         4.0                       50%&#13;
Canouan               4.0                       50%&#13;
Mustique*             0.15                      50%&#13;
* Islands not included under the project since they have their own sources of funds for solid waste management&#13;
24.   Landfill sites will be developed on each of the islands of Bequia and Canauon at the&#13;
locations indicated above. Each site will be provided with the necessary environmental&#13;
protection measures and other facilities and will be provided with a multi-purpose tracked&#13;
loader with solid waste arrangement. Mustique and Union Island will fund their own sites,&#13;
and it is anticipated in Canaouan that the developer of the large private development on the&#13;
island will contribute significantly to the capital costs of site development. However, in the&#13;
first instance base costs for the sites at Bequia and Canaouan are estimated to be US$150,000&#13;
for civil works and US$320,000 for equipment. Operation costs at these sites are estimated&#13;
at USS45,000 per site per annum. The sites both have a 20 year design life.&#13;
25.   The sites proposed for development as sanitary landfills at Brighton, Walillabou,&#13;
Taffia and Springhill Estate have been subject to both detailed hydrogeological surveys and&#13;
environmental impact assessments. These have shown that (i) all the proposed sites are&#13;
suitable for development as sanitary landfills and (ii) that negative environmental impacts will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
be negligible provided that the mitigatory measures proposed under the project are&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
Site Closures&#13;
26.   A total of five existing dump sites require closure and reinstatement - Amos Vale,&#13;
Chili and Fitz-Hughes (St. Vincent), Clifton on Union Island (to be funded separately) and&#13;
Raintree on Bequia. The total base cost of these closures is estimated at US$136,000 (Table&#13;
G4).&#13;
Disposal of Special Wastes (Part C of the Project)&#13;
27.   Equipment will be provided for the disposal of certain types of waste. A tire-&#13;
shredding machine will be provided to reduce the volume occupied by tires at landfill sites&#13;
and a stationary compactor will be provided for vehicle disposal. Glass crushers will be&#13;
provided at all disposal sites (Table G4).&#13;
Institutional Strengthening, Project Management and Monitoring (Part E of the Project)&#13;
28.   Institutional strengthening will be achieved through establishment of a Solid Waste&#13;
Management Entity in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and associated improvements in solid&#13;
waste management staff and training at a national and regional level. A key element of the&#13;
improved solid waste management system will be enhanced cost recovery and revenue&#13;
generation through the introduction of tipping fees on waste disposed at the landfill sites and&#13;
the levying of a waste management charge on visitors to the islands. Project management,&#13;
and the training and institutional support elements of the project are included as part of the&#13;
Regional Component. In addition, two pick-ups will be procured to facilitate monitoring and&#13;
management of the new system. This component will also include technical assistance in the&#13;
identification and preparation of projects to help address critical wastewater collection,&#13;
treatment and disposal problems (Table G5).&#13;

the involvement of the private sector in the solid waste management system. Furthermore,&#13;
assurances will be sought at loan negotiations that services will be contracted out where cost&#13;
efficient and beneficial to the solid waste management entity.&#13;

Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
30.   Total project costs for St. Vincent and the Grenadines including design and&#13;
supervision, physical and price contingencies and local taxes and duties are estimated to be&#13;
US$9.83 million. These additional costs are based on the following assumptions:&#13;
-     Design costs of 10% of civil works and 5% of equipment costs;&#13;
-     Supervision costs of 5% of civil works and 3% of equipment costs;&#13;
Physical contingencies of 15% for civil works, 5% for equipment and 10% for project&#13;
support activities;&#13;
Price contingencies at an average inflation rate for domestic and foreign prices of&#13;
3. 1 % to the mid-point of construction or purchase.&#13;
-     Taxes and duties based on current rates for imported equipment and materials and&#13;
varying between 5% and 70% of equipment base cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
31.   Of the project components defined above the proposed financing plan is as follows&#13;
(see also table B7):&#13;
-     The Global Environment Trust Fund will fund Parts Al, A2, C (items 3, 4 [1 unit],&#13;
and 13) and E (items 3 and 4) of the project net of taxes and duties at a total cost of&#13;
US$2.33 million.&#13;
-     The World Bank will fund Parts B, C (items 1, 2, 3, 4 [3 units], 5 to 12 and 14) and&#13;
E (items 1 and 2) of the project (50% IBRD and 50% IDA funds) net of taxes and&#13;
duties at a total cost of US$3.63 million.&#13;
-     The Caribbean Development Bank will fund Part C (items 15 and 16) of the project&#13;
net of taxes and duties at a total cost of US$1.89 mnillion.&#13;
-     The Government of St Vincent and the grenadines will fund all taxes and duties&#13;
associated with parts A,B,C and E of the project and the land associated with part C&#13;
of the Project i.e. Part C17 at a total cost of US$1.98 million.&#13;

32.   Table G7 shows the projected costs and revenues for the improved solid waste&#13;
management systems for the first few years of its operation. The recurrent cost stream&#13;
includes both operating and maintenance costs and the annualized cost of complete capital&#13;
replacement of the system. The other assumptions made are indicated in footnotes to the&#13;
table.&#13;
33.   Cost recovery will primarily be achieved through (i) the continuation of current&#13;
central government subventions to the solid waste management system; (ii) the levying of a&#13;
tipping fee on all industrial, conmnercial and institutional wastes (at a rate of US$20.00 per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
ton) and for transport and disposal of maritime waste (US$35.00 per ton for haulage and&#13;
US$40 per ton tipping fee), and (iii) the payment of an environmental levy of US$1.50 by&#13;
marine visitors and stayover tourists (see Table G7). This table shows the solid waste&#13;
management system returning a positive balance of US$230,000 in 1996, and further&#13;
sustained positive balances after 1999 provided current levels of government expenditure on&#13;
the service are maintained in real terms. However, during the period 1996-98 the&#13;
Government would have to either increase its contribution to the waste management effort or&#13;
generate additional revenues. In the longer term, additional revenues are likely to accrue&#13;
from the introduction of recycling initiatives. In addition, the Government has indicated a&#13;
desire to pursue the concept of introducing a tax on the packaging on consumable items&#13;
imported into the country to raise revenues and discourage import of excessive packaging.&#13;
The potential for such revenues will be considered under the Regional Component. The&#13;
details of revenue generation and cost recovery mechanisms would be agreed and put in place&#13;
prior to loan effectiveness.&#13;

3.    Industrial, commercial and institutional (IC&amp;I) tipping receipts are calculated at $US 0 per Ion in Year I, $US 10 per ton in Year 2 and $US 20&#13;
per Ion in Year 3 and following, inflated at a rate of 3.1 lercent per year beginning in Year 2. It is assuined tIal 100 percent of eslimaled IC&amp;I&#13;
waste generated is delivered to landfill by either government or private haulers and that landEfill tipping fee revenues from itiis waste accrue to&#13;
government.&#13;
4.    IC&amp;[ llaul receipts are calculated on the basis that government performs contract baulage of 80 percent of the IC&amp;I waste generatedl and receives&#13;
the revenue associated witli haulage calculated in the OECS Waste Management Project Final Report. Remaining IC&amp;I waste is assumed to be&#13;
hauled by the private sector without revenue to government. IC&amp;I waste collecled/disposed of is assumed to grow at a rate of 4.1 percent per&#13;
year, reflecting recent average GDP growth rates in Ilie OECS countries.&#13;
5.     The Marine Visitor and Stayover Visitor Levy is calculated on the basis of $US 1.50 per person beginning midway through year two of the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.      Marine Visitor I laul/Disposal is calculated o0i (lie basis of $75 per ton (a lipping fee of US$40 per ton and an assumed transportation cost of&#13;
U1S$35 per lon) (inflated at 3.1 percenl per year) as a regional cliarge for haliling/disposinig tliese wastes lan(lcd in all oECS counlries.&#13;
7.      Stayover Visitor llaul/Disposal is calculated on the basis of Ilte landlill tipping charge idenlilied in Note 3, above, plus ilte liaulage charge&#13;
calculated for the country. It is assumed that 80 percent of these wastes will be hauled by government and ihat ilhe private sector will undertake&#13;
remaining haulage.&#13;
8.      Marine Visitor and Stayover Visitor wastes are assumed to grow at 5 percent per year.&#13;
9.      Except as indicated, recurrent costs and revenues are assumed to be inctirred over the whole year in whicih tlie cost or revenie item is introduced.&#13;
10.    Additional revenue could be raised from Ilte sale of recyclable malerials, the levying of a tax on imported disposable materials and producis, and a&#13;
management fee levied on vehicles and appliances to provide for their management at the end of their life.&#13;

TECHN-ICAL ASSISTANCE FOR PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE&#13;
SEWERAGE A.ND SEWAGE TREATMEENT COMPONEiNT&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The proposed Regional Component of the project will simultaneously tackle the&#13;
problems of project identification, preparation and design of wastewater collection, treatmnent&#13;
and disposal svstems, and the strengthening of the instirutional structure in the environmental&#13;
sector in the region. The objective is to make a major contribution towards arresting the&#13;
continuing deterioration in the quality of the environment of the Eastern Caribbean, by&#13;
addressing the major deficiencies in the solid and liquid waste disposal sectors, and&#13;
supporting institutional strengthening and rationalization measures in those agencies which&#13;
are at the forefront of the fight against deteriorating environmental quality in the region.&#13;
2.    The objective of these Terms of Reference is to assist in the identification and&#13;
preparation of sanitation, sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries.&#13;
The services required to fulfill these TOR will be split into two stages. The first stage of the&#13;
work involves a comprehensive review and evaluation of wastewater collection, treatment&#13;
and disposal problems, deficiencies and current proposals in each of the six OECS countries,&#13;
evaluation and prioritization of the interventions required to address the most pressing&#13;
problems and an evaluation and recommendation of the types of technology to be used. The&#13;
outputs include an overview of the sector, and a prioritized list of investments in the urban&#13;
sanitation, sewerage and sewage treatment sectors for each of the OECS islands, supported&#13;
by outline costs and possible phasing. These should be developed within any sewerage&#13;
masterplans being followed by the countries. The second stage of the work involves the&#13;
preparation of detailed designs and full feasibility studies for the identified and selected&#13;
priority sanitation, sewerage and sewage treatment project components in certain of the&#13;
OECS countries. This stage would also provide detailed institutional and cost recovery&#13;
proposals to ensure the technical and financial sustainability of the projects proposed. Stage&#13;
2 would be carried out only in those OECS countries interested in, and eligible to, receive&#13;
IBRD/IDA funds for the implementation of the proposed projects. It is probable that Phase 2&#13;
would be carried out in all or some of Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and St.&#13;
Vincent and the Grenadines. Subject to satisfactory performance by the consultant in&#13;
undertaking stage 1 of the work, the consultant might also be requested to undertake stage 2.&#13;
3.    At the completion of the second stage, the resultant project packages should be&#13;
submitted in sufficient detail to enable them to be appraised by an international lending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
institution. They should also have been agreed by, and enjoy the full backing of, the&#13;
concerned governments.&#13;
THE TASK&#13;
Stage 1:&#13;
4.    The services to be provided under Stage 1 of this TOR involve the completion of the&#13;
following tasks in each of the OECS countries.&#13;
Project Identification and Prioritization.&#13;
Carry out a comprehensive review of the existing urban sanitation and&#13;
wastewater collection and treatmnent systems, and of documentation relating to&#13;
the sector.&#13;
Using information gained from this review, and from additional surveys as&#13;
necessary, compile a comprehensive data base for the urban sanitation and&#13;
wastewater sector.&#13;
Investigate current institutional and cost recovery arrangements for the urban&#13;
sanitation and wastewater collection, treatment and disposal sectors.&#13;
Assess in detail, the adequacy of existing provision for excreta, sullage and&#13;
sewage disposal for major urban areas in each of the OECS islands.&#13;
Examine existing major wastewater disposal sites and outfalls with particular&#13;
reference to their current detrimental impact on the environment.&#13;
Assess the potential for effluent reuse (if any).&#13;
Assess existing capability for maintenance of sewerage systems, sewage&#13;
treatment plants and associated equipment.&#13;
Assess and prioritise the needs and deficiencies of the systems currently used&#13;
for excreta disposal and the collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewater&#13;
in the major urban areas of the OECS islands.&#13;
Based on existing socio-economic data and on additional surveys as necessary,&#13;
assess willingness and ability of communities to pay for sanitation facilities and&#13;
wastewater collection treatment and disposal.&#13;
Based on considerations of social behavior, public preferences, physical&#13;
conditions, institutional capabilities and affordability, derive and evaluate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
options for technological approach, levels of service and design standards to&#13;
address the identified priority problems.&#13;
based on this evaluation, develop proposals as to the most cost-effective&#13;
technologies, levels of service and design standards. Investigate the&#13;
opportunities for regional harmonization of such design parameters.&#13;
Based on the selected technologies and standards, and the prioritized needs and&#13;
deficiencies, develop proposals for excreta disposal and/or wastewater&#13;
collection, treatment and disposal improvements for the highest priority sub-&#13;
projects in each country for a design horizon of 25 years.&#13;
Based on the foregoing, prepare outline plans and programs for the identified&#13;
priority project sub-components as necessarv to allow calculation of&#13;
corresponding outline cost estimates.&#13;
Recommend institutional arrangements to ensure effective execution of the sub-&#13;
project components, and as necessary to improve the management, operation&#13;
and maintenance of the excreta disposal and wastewater collection, treatment&#13;
and disposal systems.&#13;
Develop the principles and outline proposals for recovery of all costs&#13;
associated with the excreta and wastewater collection, treatment and disposal&#13;
systems.&#13;
Stage 2:&#13;
Project Preparation and Design.&#13;
- For the identified priority sub-projects in the countries wishing to proceed with&#13;
the project, as modified or amended by either the OECS governments&#13;
themselves or the Bank, undertake all detailed surveys as necessary to facilitate&#13;
design and environmental, economic and financial evaluation and assessment of&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
based on these surveys and the agreed technological approach, levels of service&#13;
and design standards for the identified sub-projects, carry out full detailed&#13;
designs including all design and structural calculations as necessary.&#13;
prepare outline specifications for all sub-project components.&#13;
Based on these designs and specifications, prepared detailed cost estimates for&#13;
all sub-project components including capital and operation and maintenance&#13;
costs, and develop a detailed irnplementation schedule for project execution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 111 -&#13;
Complete environmental impact assessments for each proposed sub-project&#13;
component in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.&#13;
-     Carrv out full economic and financial analyses as necessary to demonstrate the&#13;
economic and/or financial viability of each sub-project component.&#13;
-     Develop and prepare detailed proposals for cost recovery, and make detailed&#13;
recommendations for any institutional strengthening required to ensure that&#13;
sufficient financial and technical resources are made available for the&#13;
sustainable operation of the systems constructed under the project.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
5.    A great deal of work on the review and assessment of coastal zone pollution,&#13;
and excreta and wastewater collection, treatment and disposal has been carried out by&#13;
a variety of agencies, on both a regional and country basis, or by the OECS&#13;
govern=ents themselves in recent years. In addition, CDB, CEHI, PAHO, NRIMU&#13;
and a number of other multi-lateral and bi-lateral agencies are providing ongoing&#13;
assistance to the OECS countries in dealing with problems of excreta and wastewater&#13;
collection, treatment and disposal. Projects in the sewerage and sewage treatment&#13;
sectors are being supported by French Aid in St. Lucia. USAID in Grenada, and&#13;
CIDA and CDB in Dominica.&#13;
6.    To save time in data collection and evaluation, and to avoid duplication of&#13;
effort. it is vital that in undertaking the work, the consultants review in detail all&#13;
studies, plans and designs in the relevant sectors previously undertaken at a national,&#13;
regional or local level, and use the recommendations and proposals made where&#13;
appropriate. Since, as mentioned above, a number of agencies (e.g. CIDA, French&#13;
Aid, and USAID) have been, and continue to be, actively involved in supporting this&#13;
sector in a number of islands, there are already project proposals which have been&#13;
subjected to preliminary or detailed design.&#13;
7.    It is important that in approaching the work, the consultant does not merely&#13;
restate the problem, or duplicate work which has already been completed. It is the&#13;
dury of the consultant to ensure that they appraise themselves fully of all work&#13;
previously undertaken in this sector and use it where appropriate.&#13;
Stage 1:&#13;
8.    The scope of work involved in achieving the objectives outlined above for&#13;
Stage 1 of the work will be as follows:&#13;
Review of Previous Studies and Collection of Data: Review all&#13;
existing data, statistics and reports relating to the urban wastewater,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
excreta disposal and associated sectors in each of the OECS countries.&#13;
Data required should include, as appropriate, population, income&#13;
distribution, land use, local and national government organization,&#13;
financial arrangements, revenues and expenditures relating to excreta&#13;
and wastewater disposal, commercial and industrial activity, land and&#13;
water resources, and climate and geography. In addition, the&#13;
respective national development plans, national development strategies,&#13;
and public sector investment programs as they affect the excreta and&#13;
wastewater disposal sector in particular, and environmental policy in&#13;
general, should be reviewed and evaluated. In obtaining these data, full&#13;
use should be made of previous reports prepared for a number of the&#13;
islands in the excreta and wastewater management and associated&#13;
sectors.&#13;
Compilation of Data Base: Using the information obtained from the&#13;
review outlined above, collect and update data in order to establish a&#13;
comprehensive data base for the excreta and wastewater management&#13;
sector in each of the islands. Current data should be collected on&#13;
excreta and wastewater generation rates from households, institutions,&#13;
commercial establishments, and any industrial establishments, and used&#13;
to project future wastewater flows.&#13;
Institutional and Cost-Recoverv Arrangements: Review the existing&#13;
institutional arrangements adopted by each of the islands in the excreta&#13;
and wastewater disposal sectors. Assess the adequacy of these&#13;
arrangements and of the technical and management capability and&#13;
adequacy of staff responsible for operation and management of the&#13;
excreta and wastewater disposal systems. Review the existing&#13;
arrangements for cost-recovery to include the efficiency of collection (if&#13;
any) and the adequacy of billing and accountancy procedures.&#13;
Adequacy of Existing Arrangements for Excreta Disposal: Based on&#13;
discussions with OECS governments, and on the reviews undertaken&#13;
above, assess the adequacy of existing systems of excreta disposal at&#13;
wastewater collection, treatment and disposal. Where collection&#13;
systems exist, assess the adequacy of these systems in terms of size and&#13;
condition of sewer networks. Evaluate the excreta disposal systems&#13;
used based on their conformity with the requirements of accepted&#13;
standards of public health.&#13;
Assessment of Existing Wastewater Disposal Facilities: Examine and&#13;
assess the adequacy of current methods of wastewater treatment and&#13;
disposal. In particular, assess any negative environmental or public&#13;
health impacts of foreshore or sea outfalls, or discharges to wetlands or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
water courses. Where treatment systems are operated, assess the&#13;
adequacy and efficiency of these facilities, and of provision for their&#13;
operation and maintenance.&#13;
Assessment of Alternative Methods for Effluent Disposal: Examine&#13;
feasibility of alternative methods for effluent disposal including deep&#13;
sea outfalls, irrigation, groundwater recharge, pisciculture in ponds,&#13;
etc.&#13;
Assessment of Technical Capabilities: Assess the technical and&#13;
management capabilities of staff involved at all levels of the agencies&#13;
responsible for excreta disposal and wastewater collection, treatment&#13;
and disposal. Where there are no operational sewerage or sewage&#13;
treatment systems, assess the relative technical and management&#13;
strengths of those agencies currently responsible for sanitation and&#13;
water supply. Determine the adequacy of these technical and&#13;
management resources in operation of a new or extended wastewater&#13;
treatment and disposal system.&#13;
Priority Needs and Deficiencies: Based on the foregoina review of&#13;
the current levels of service and facilities, determine critical areas of&#13;
need and deficiencv in these sectors. Priorities these deficiencies in&#13;
terms of their severity and other relevant criteria to be determined by&#13;
the consultant. These might include replacement of existing&#13;
unsatisfactory sanitation systems, rehabilitation and extension of&#13;
dilapidated and overloaded systems, provision of treatment facilities,&#13;
improved disposal systems, etc.&#13;
Willingness and Ability to Pay: Based on existing socio-economic&#13;
data, supported as necessary by additional surveys, primary data&#13;
collection and interviews, assess the willingness and ability of various&#13;
communities to pay for sanitation and wastewater collection treatment&#13;
and disposal facilities. These investigations should focus on those&#13;
communities where needs and deficiencies in this sector are greatest,&#13;
and should include the business community and high, middle and low&#13;
income housing areas, as appropriate.&#13;
Technology, Levels of Service and Design Standards: Based on&#13;
considerations of social behavior, public preferences, local conditions,&#13;
future development. affordability etc., and taking into account all&#13;
recommendations made in other studies, develop appropriate options for&#13;
the types of technology, levels of service and design standards to be&#13;
used in the proposed sub-projects. Evaluate these options in terms of&#13;
their acceptability, affordability and technical appropriateness and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114-&#13;
determine the most appropriate and cost effective options. Evaluation&#13;
of these options should take full account of those levels of service and&#13;
design standards currently used by the agencies responsible for&#13;
sewerage and sewage treatment in the OECS countries.&#13;
Develop Design Guidelines: Based on the technology adopted,&#13;
develop guidelines for appropriate and cost-effective levels of service&#13;
and design standards for the sewerage and sewage treatment sectors.&#13;
Explore the possibilities of, and make appropriate recomnnendations&#13;
for, harmonization of these levels of service and standards within the&#13;
OECS. The methodoloay employed in identifying these criteria should&#13;
involve the communities affected to the greatest extent possible.&#13;
Identiflcation of Project Components: Based on the foregoing&#13;
reviews, assessment and analyses, and on the prioritization of&#13;
deficiencies, develop proposals for high priority improvements to&#13;
excreta disposal and/or wastewater collection, treatment and disposal&#13;
systems. These proposals should, where appropriate, incorporate the&#13;
existing plans and proposals of the OECS govermments and aid&#13;
agencies, ILAs or NGOs assisting these governments, and of the&#13;
community and Community Based Organizations. The proposals&#13;
should provide for time-bound improvements required to address the&#13;
existing deficiencies and deal with the incremental increase in excreta&#13;
and wastewater flow during a design period of 25 years. In&#13;
recommending improvements to the systems, full account should be&#13;
taken of the need to build on existing networks. In general, the&#13;
potential for upgrading of existing systems should be undertaken in&#13;
preference to installation of completely new networks, although it is&#13;
understood that in many instances, provision of entirely new systems is&#13;
necessary.&#13;
Preparation of Outline Designs: Outline plans and designs will be&#13;
prepared for all sub-project components identified above based on the&#13;
levels of service and design standards adopted above. It is anticipated&#13;
that a number of the sub-projects identified will already have&#13;
preliminary or detailed designs prepared by other agencies or the OECS&#13;
governments. For those components identified which do not already&#13;
have designs prepared, layout plans and outline designs will need to be&#13;
prepared in order for costs to be calculated to within 20 percent.&#13;
Designs will need to be based on information available through the&#13;
existing database since time constraints will preclude the carrying out of&#13;
site surveys under this stage of the work. Phasing of the program of&#13;
investments proposed should be carried out based on the financial&#13;
resources of the respective national and local governments, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
consistent with technical and institutional constraints and opportunities&#13;
for cost recovery over time.&#13;
Recommendations for Project Execution, MNaintenance and&#13;
Operation: Make recommendations for the institutional arrangements&#13;
required for the effective execution of the project and to ensure&#13;
efficient maintenance, operation and management of the upgraded&#13;
collection, treatment and disposal systems. In particular, the consultant&#13;
should consider the requirements for strengthening of existing&#13;
institutions in order to enable them to effectively manage, operate and&#13;
maintain the new or extended systems. Where there are currently no&#13;
clear institutional responsibilities for sewerage systems, the consultant&#13;
should make clear recommendations as to which agency should assume&#13;
responsibilities in this sector, and identifv the strengthening measures&#13;
required. Emphasis should be given to the potential role which the&#13;
private sector could play in the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
systems proposed.&#13;
Project Costs and Implementation Schedule: Outline costs for&#13;
proposed sub-projects should be calculated and all investment,&#13;
operating and maintenance costs relating to priority sub-projects will be&#13;
provided. Local and foreign exchange costs for capital works and&#13;
equipment will be identified and costing will indicate import duties,&#13;
taxes etc. that may be applicable. Current costs will be used as a basis&#13;
for all costina and will be inflated at appropriate rates (as provided by&#13;
the World Bank) to arrive at preliminary cost estimates. Phasing of the&#13;
program of investments comprising the prepared projects will be&#13;
reconmnended based on the financial resources of the individual national&#13;
and local governments, and consistent with opportunities for cost&#13;
recovery over time.&#13;
Proposals for Cost Recovery: Develop outline proposals for the&#13;
recovery of all costs associated with the construction, operation and&#13;
maintenance of the proposed sub-projects. The consultant should assess&#13;
the willingness and ability of the public to pay for the services to be&#13;
provided under the project.&#13;
Stage 2&#13;
9.    Following the completion of Stage 1, the proposals will be reviewed in detail&#13;
by the OECS governments, Project Coordination Unit and the Bank. Amendments,&#13;
modifications and revisions may be required as a result of this review and will be&#13;
incorporated into the proposals prior to the commencement of Stage 2. It is&#13;
anticipated that subject to satisfactory performance, the consultants for Staae 1 of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
work could be retained to carry out Stage 2. However. whereas Stage 1 of the&#13;
technical assistance would be undertaken on a regional basis for all the OECS&#13;
counEries, Stage 2 would be carried out on a country by country basis and only in&#13;
those countries interested in, and eligible for, Bank fmancing in this sector.&#13;
Furthermore the client in the case of Stage 2 projects would be the Water and&#13;
Sewerage Authorities or other authority with these responsibilities. It is anticipated&#13;
that beneficiary countries could comprise Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia and&#13;
St Vincent and the Grenadines. This stage would involve the followina activities in&#13;
each count7y.&#13;
Survevs: A number of surveys will be required in order to complete&#13;
project preparation, design and justification. Where possible, existing&#13;
survey information will be used checked and confirmed as necessary.&#13;
All survey work. as necessary to complete the activities itemized&#13;
below, must be undertaken in a timely fashion so as not to delay other&#13;
project activities. Topographic surveys will be required for all project&#13;
sites and sewer alignments. Hydrogeological, soil and other surveys&#13;
will be necessary for the preparation of detailed engineering designs.&#13;
Further surveys will be required to complete environmental impact&#13;
assessments, project justification and cost recovery proposals.&#13;
However, surveys undertaken should comprise the minimum necessary&#13;
to provide the outputs and levels of detail required as specified below.&#13;
Detailed Design: For the identified and selected priority sub-projects&#13;
for the beneficiary OECS countries, undertake detailed designs. In the&#13;
case of some beneficiary countries, it is anticipated that the priority&#13;
projects identified will include part or all of schemes for which detailed&#13;
designs are already complete. In these cases, it will only be necessary&#13;
for the consultant to review, amend and update as necessary, and&#13;
package the sub-projects to conform to the criteria agreed under Stage 1&#13;
of the project. Detailed designs should be based upon full design and&#13;
structural calculations as necessary. In completing detailed designs and&#13;
in drawing up specifications and contract documentation (see below),&#13;
careful consideration must be given to the economies of scale inherent&#13;
in such projects in small island states and in conforming to the&#13;
procedures of the beneficiary countries of the OECS and the Project&#13;
Coordinating Unit. To ensure the simplest possible execution of the&#13;
project, standardization of designs, specifications and contract&#13;
documentation should be adopted wherever possible.&#13;
Outline Specifications: As part of the detailed design exercise the&#13;
consultant will undertake preparation of all working drawings and&#13;
outline specifications as necessary for all civil works installations and&#13;
items of equipment procured for each sub-component included in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
project. The outline specifications for civil works and equipment&#13;
should be produced in accordance with accepted international standards,&#13;
based on the levels of service and design standards agreed during Stage&#13;
1 of these services . Where no acceptable local desian standards are&#13;
available, detailed designs and specifications should be based on British&#13;
(BS) or American (ASTM) standards. Where specifications have&#13;
previously been prepared for identified priority sub-projects, the&#13;
consultant will review these and amend them as necessary to bring&#13;
them into line with the agreed guidelines for the project.&#13;
Detailed Cost Estimates and Project Scheduling: Based on the&#13;
designs and specifications prepared above. detailed cost estimates (the&#13;
"Approved Agency Estimate") should be prepared for each sub-project&#13;
component. Local and foreign exchange costs for capital works and&#13;
equipment will be calculated based on quantities taken from design&#13;
drawings and using prevailing market rates for civil works and&#13;
equipment elements. All costing will indicate local import duties and&#13;
taxes that are applicable in each beneficiary country. Current costs&#13;
will be used as a basis for all costing and based on the detailed&#13;
implementation program prepared, will be inflated at appropriate rates&#13;
(as provided by the World Bank) to arrive at detailed cost estimates for&#13;
each sub-project.&#13;
Implementation Schedules: The timing of implementation of each&#13;
sub-project component should be developed in detail based upon such&#13;
considerations as the incremental approach to sub-project development,&#13;
political and social/technical priorities and sources of funding and&#13;
ability to pay. In particular, the consultant should avoid situations&#13;
where sewerage is constructed and remains seriously underutilized for&#13;
years due to the reluctance or inability of householders to pay for or&#13;
construct connections to the new system.&#13;
Preparation of Pre-Qualification and Bidding Documents: In&#13;
accordance with World Bank guidelines, standard model pre-&#13;
qualification and bidding documents will be prepared for all items to be&#13;
constructed or procured under the project. Where documents have&#13;
already been prepared by the beneficiarv countries or others for&#13;
identified priority sub-projects, the consultant will review these and&#13;
amend them as necessary to bring them into conformity with national,&#13;
regional and World Bank standards and guidelines. If appropriate,&#13;
separate bidding documents should be prepared for those works or&#13;
items of equipment to be procured either locally or internationally. In&#13;
either case, standard bid documents will be prepared to include&#13;
standard terms and conditions, typical conditions of particular&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
application for certain types of sub-project, standard specifications and&#13;
detailed bills of quantities.&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessments: Environmnental impact&#13;
assessments, as necessary for all sub-project components should be&#13;
undertaken in accordance with the Bank's guidelines on EIAs. The&#13;
consultant will also need to ensure that the project sub-components&#13;
proposed for priority funding are clearlv justifiable in terms of their&#13;
appropriateness and the sustainabiliry of the technology adopted. All&#13;
field surveys necessary for the adequate completion of the EIAs must&#13;
be carried out by the consultant where adequate information is not&#13;
currently available.&#13;
Economic and Financial Justification: All identified sub-project&#13;
components will be subjected to economic and\or financial analysis as&#13;
appropriate in order to confirm their viability. Economic analysis will&#13;
be carried out for all components based on anticipated savings&#13;
calculated from improvements in public health, reduction in infectious&#13;
disease and possibly other economic benefits relating to the retention of&#13;
the tourism industry.&#13;
Financial Analvsis: Particular attention should be paid to achieving full&#13;
cost recovery, and it is considered important that the collection,&#13;
treatment and disposal systems adopted should be sustainable and&#13;
should in general avoid the need for any long-term governnent subsidy.&#13;
The systems proposed must thus be shown to be capable of being&#13;
operated and maintained in a sustainable manner, based upon the&#13;
revenues obtainable. Detailed cost recovery proposals prepared should&#13;
be supported with affordability analysis based on household surveys&#13;
which clearly demonstrate the willingness and ability of the&#13;
conmmunities concerned to pay for the service provided. Full financial&#13;
forecasts should be prepared for the systems. The project impact on&#13;
existing budgets should be shown by preparing cost and financing plans&#13;
and financial projections for the implementing agency with and without&#13;
the project.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening and Financial Sustainability: Based on&#13;
the recommendations made during Stage 1, prepare detailed time-bound&#13;
plans as necessary for the institutional strengthening of implementing&#13;
and executing agencies. These recommendations should be discussed&#13;
and agreed with the agencies concerned and should include proposals&#13;
for additional facilities and equipment, recormrmend staffing additions&#13;
and training to administer, operate and maintain the upgraded systems,&#13;
and the regulatory educational and enforcement procedures necessary to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119-&#13;
accommodate the systems. Attention should also be given to the&#13;
establishment of systems and procedures necessary to ensure high&#13;
efficiency in revenue collection in order to ensure adequate cost&#13;
recovery.&#13;
OUTPUTS&#13;
Stage 1&#13;
Inception Report: After four weeks of the study, a brief Inception&#13;
Report will be prepared setting out the initial findings and presenting a&#13;
detailed work program. This report should recommend any changes to&#13;
the work program, content, or outputs from the study based on the&#13;
initial review of documentation and data coUection and on the&#13;
assessment of constraints and deficiencies in the project sectors.&#13;
Interim Report: After three months of the study, an interim report&#13;
will be prepared describing the exiting conditions in the sector in each&#13;
country, identifying the key problems and deficiencies, and outlining&#13;
the technical, design, institutional and cost recovery options available to&#13;
address these key issues, for consideration by the participating&#13;
governnents the OECS secretariat and the Bank.&#13;
Draft Final Report: Based on responses to the interim report and after&#13;
six months of the study, a draft final report will be prepared defining&#13;
and outlining the proposed priority project packages, and the&#13;
recommended technologies, levels of service and standards to be&#13;
adopted. This report should also outline the proposed mechanisms for&#13;
achieving cost recovery and for project implementation, and the&#13;
management, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure to be&#13;
provided through the project.&#13;
Final Report: Seven months after cormencement of the study, and&#13;
after allowing one month for review of the draft fmal report by the&#13;
Bank, OECS Secretariat, OECS governments, project coordination unit&#13;
and other concerned agencies, the consultant will prepare a final Stage&#13;
1 report incorporating the comments of the reviewing agencies. This&#13;
will form the basis for Stage 2 activities in the beneficiary countries.&#13;
Stage 2&#13;
Under Stage 2, reporting will be carried out for each beneficiary country separately.&#13;
It is probable that each country will move at a different pace and hence reporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
dates will vary from country to country. However, in each country, the reporting&#13;
schedule will follow the pattern indicated below.&#13;
Inception Report: After four weeks of the study, a brief Inception&#13;
Report will be prepared setting out the initial findings and presenting a&#13;
detailed work program. This report should recommend any changes to&#13;
the work program, content. or outputs from the study based on the&#13;
initial review of Stage 1 outputs, and report in detail on the surveys&#13;
required and their status of completion.&#13;
Interim Report After three months of the study full layout plans and&#13;
outline engineering designs for all proposed sub-project components,&#13;
preliminary costing, and proposed methodology for economic and&#13;
financial feasibility studies will be prepared. In addition, outline&#13;
environmental impact statements and proposals for management,&#13;
operation and maintenance of projects will be prepared.&#13;
Draft Final Report: After eight months of the study final layout&#13;
plans, and engineering designs for all proposed sub-project components&#13;
will be submitted together with associated design calculations. In&#13;
addition, detailed project costing and complete economic and financial&#13;
feasibility analyses for each sub-project component will be prepared.&#13;
This report will also present complete environmental impact&#13;
assessments for each sub-project site and final proposals for&#13;
management, operation and maintenance of the systems to be&#13;
developed. The potential role for the private sector in management and&#13;
operation of the system should be clearlv identified. This report should&#13;
also provide details of project cash flows, cost recovery proposals and&#13;
financing plans for the implementing agencies and for each sub-project&#13;
component.&#13;
Final Report: Nine months after commencement of the study, and&#13;
after allowing one month for review of the draft final report by the&#13;
Bank, concerned beneficiary OECS government, project coordination&#13;
unit and other concerned agencies, the consultant will prepare a final&#13;
Stage 2 report incorporating the comments of the reviewing agencies.&#13;
This will include all the items submitted with the draft final report&#13;
amended as necessary based on the review findings.&#13;
Contract Documents: Concurrently with the submission of the Final&#13;
Report, the consultant will deliver complete sets of contract documents&#13;
including sample general and specific conditions, design reports, all&#13;
detailed designs and specifications for the identified priority sub-project&#13;
components for the beneficiary country.&#13;

WORKING ARRANGEiMIENTS, DATA, SERVICES AND FACILITIES TO BE&#13;
PROVIDED BY THE CLIENT ANND THE CONSU-LTANT.&#13;
10.   The consultant will work throughout from their own offices in one or more of&#13;
the countries of the OECS. During Stage 1 of the project, the consultant will work&#13;
under the overall supervision of the Project Coordination Unit and the Bank's project&#13;
coordinator, who is responsible for coordinating all project activities and consolidating&#13;
the various project components. The consultant will liaise closely with each of the&#13;
OECS governments included under the project, with regrional organizations involved&#13;
in the project sectors, particularly CEHI, NRMU, PAHO and UNEP and ILAs and&#13;
bi-lateral funding agencies involved in the sewerage and sewage treatnent sectors&#13;
(USAID, CIDA, French Aid, EEC, CDB, etc.).&#13;
11.   No services and facilities will be provided for use of the consultant by the&#13;
client with the exception of facilitating access by the consultant to reports, documents,&#13;
other pertinent information and relevant government personnel. Liaison staff will also&#13;
be identified in each country to work with the consultant on the assignment. The&#13;
consultant is expected to provide his own facilities as follows:&#13;
-     Air-conditioned office space&#13;
-     Office furnishing and access to computing and photocopying equipment&#13;
-     Use of telephone lines (local use)&#13;
-     Payment of utility bills&#13;
For Staae 2 of the project the consultant will be expected to establish offices in each&#13;
of the beneficiary countries.&#13;
MANNING SCHEDULES A)ND COSTS&#13;
12.   In estimating the man-month requirements and costs of the services described&#13;
above, the consultant should ensure that his proposal takes full account of the above&#13;
requirements and the following items, the costs of which would need to be borne by&#13;
the consultant.&#13;
-     Consultant's remuneration&#13;
-     Consultant's out-of-pocket expenses&#13;
-     Consultant's per diem&#13;
-     Support staff services&#13;
-     Car hire&#13;
-     Equipment hire&#13;
-     Incernational and local travel for team&#13;
-     Communication costs&#13;
-     Report production costs&#13;
-     Field office operational costs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
13.   Man-month schedules and associated costs should clearly distinguish between&#13;
services required for Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the project.&#13;

WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES&#13;
Ship's Wastes System Description&#13;
MIajor Ports&#13;
2.    St. John's, Antigua; Castries, St. Lucia; and St. George's, Grenada frequently&#13;
have a number of cruise ships (up to six) in port at anv one time, either alongside&#13;
dedicated cruise ship berths, alongside general cargo berths or lying at anchor in the&#13;
harbor. Compacted garbage in bins of the size contemplated (45 cubic feet) will&#13;
weigh approximately 1,800 pounds. On dedicated cruise ship berths without vehicle&#13;
access on the inboard side and for ships lying at anchor in the harbor a barge is&#13;
required to remove the garbage from the storage space on the No. 2 deck from the&#13;
outboard side. In fact, the removal of garbage from the outboard side is desirable in&#13;
all cases from a safety and aesthetic point of view.&#13;
3.    The barge will have to be fitted with a lifting device that can remove the&#13;
loaded bin from the cruise ship and subsequently hoist it onto quay side. It is&#13;
anticipated that a small crane with telescopic job and boom would be able to carry out&#13;
this function. The deck of the barge will be approximately five feet above sea level&#13;
to coincide with the No. 2 deck elevation and the hoist will be able to deposit the bins&#13;
on the quay at approximately elevation plus 12 feet. Each major port will have one&#13;
such barge. The barge will service the cruise ships by supplying them with recycled&#13;
sanitized bins and removing from them the bins in which the compacted garbage has&#13;
been placed. The barges will be self-propelled and will require a crew of two; one to&#13;
operate the barge and one to operate the crane and to attend to linesman's duties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
The operation tirne would be one or two hours per day only and could be carried out&#13;
by existing staff. The capital base cost of the barge outfitted with the hoist is&#13;
approximately US$ 125,000.&#13;
4.     When the bins of compacted garbage, sorted as to food contaminated wastes&#13;
and all other wastes, have been placed on the quay it will then be handled as regular&#13;
break bulk cargo and moved by the port's forklift trucks to storage in specially&#13;
designed 20 ft ISO containers which will hold 16 bins each.&#13;
5.     Cargo ships can place their loaded bins directly on the quay using their&#13;
existina pallet cargo slings, and take up fresh empties the same way.&#13;
6.     At appropriate times, either when a container is loaded with bins or when all&#13;
of the bins have been removed from the cruise ships in the harbor for the day, the 20&#13;
ft container will be loaded on a chassis with the port's equipment and taken to the&#13;
landfill site where a tracked loader fitted with rotating forks will be provided to place&#13;
the garbage in the landfill site.&#13;
7.     The bins will then be washed and sterilized, loaded back into the container and&#13;
returned to the port compound for reuse.&#13;
8.     The bins are designed so that when filled with uncompacted garbage, as they&#13;
will be at small craft harbors, they can be lifted by two men and placed in the&#13;
container for transport to the landfill site.&#13;
Small Craft Harbors&#13;
9.     Small craft harbors will have small plastic refuse disposal bins or tote carts&#13;
which can be easily lifted by two people conveniently located at dockside to receive&#13;
the uncompacted wastes (food contaminated - red; all other - green) from small craft&#13;
and yachts; these bins will be fitted with covers.&#13;
10.   The size and weight are such that two men can lift the full bin and tip it into a&#13;
compactor vehicle, place it in a container or on the back of a lorry for transport to the&#13;
landfill site.&#13;
11.   Vessels arriving in the state from international waters will be required to&#13;
dispose of their wastes in this manner and a charge will be levied for their use.&#13;
Vessels remaining within small craft harbors and marinas will thereafter use the&#13;
domestic waste disposal system provided by the marina or port, the cost of which is&#13;
usually included in the mooring fees.&#13;

ANNEX J&#13;
OECS WASTE MANAGEMvENT PROJECT&#13;
THE REGIONAL COMPONENT&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The implementation of the OECS Waste Management Project will require a&#13;
wide range of initiatives to be undertaken by each country. A number of these&#13;
activities are characterized either by similarity between countries or by countries&#13;
possessing a common interest in having particular components developed. These&#13;
components can be most effectively developed through initiatives at the regional level&#13;
which can then be adopted and implemented according to the specific requirements&#13;
and timing of national agenda.&#13;
2.    The following technical assistance activities should be undertaken at the&#13;
regional level to complement and strengthen national waste management programs:&#13;
-     project management support should be provided to countries as they&#13;
implement their waste management programs;&#13;
model legislation should be developed to provide an adequate legislative&#13;
framework for solid waste operations in each country;&#13;
-     local and regional markets for compost and recyclable materials should&#13;
be identified and negotiated;&#13;
-     a regional training program should be developed;&#13;
-     waste management documentation preparation and monitoring should be&#13;
undertaken;&#13;
-     an annual regional waste management workshop should be&#13;
implemented;&#13;
-     a model environmental education program should be developed;&#13;
-     systems for project benefit, monitoring and evaluation should be&#13;
established;&#13;
-     supervision and coordination of the technical assistance in the&#13;
preparation of sanitation, sewerage and sewage treatment and disposal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
proposals will be required. (These services are described in detail in&#13;
Appendix H.)&#13;
3.    Implementation of these initiatives will require the retaining of consulting&#13;
technical assistance expertise.&#13;
ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.    Regional initiatives associated with the implementation of the OECS Waste&#13;
Management Project should be undertaken through a Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMMU). Subject to negotiations between all affected parties, the PMU could be&#13;
housed within the Natural Resources Management Unit (NRMU) of the OECS&#13;
Secretariat or could be a stand-alone entity within the context of the OECS Waste&#13;
Management Project. The mandate of the PMU will be to effectively implement&#13;
regional tasks and, in so doing, to facilitate the implementation of the waste&#13;
management program in each country. It would also have primary responsibility for&#13;
the consolidation of physical and financial progress monitoring from each country,&#13;
and for reporting consolidated progress to the funding agencies.&#13;
5.    The PMU will be staffed by a Project Manager/Coordinator, a Financial&#13;
Manager, and support staff. The PMU will also be able to bring in additional&#13;
expertise as required. All permanent positions will be hired on a contract basis for a&#13;
period of 1 year renewable, subject to satisfactory performance, for up to a maximum&#13;
of 5 years.&#13;
6.    The Project Manager/ Coordinator's position will require a Bachelor's degree&#13;
in an environmental science or engineering discipline; a post-graduate degree will be&#13;
preferred. Many years experience in the implementation of complex projects will be&#13;
required, with particular experience in procurement, contract preparation and&#13;
negotiation, administration of consulting assignments, and budget management.&#13;
Extensive experience in the design and/or implementation of waste management&#13;
programs will be required, together with a good knowledge of waste management&#13;
technologies and waste minimization/recycling strategies and demonstrated project&#13;
management skills. Familiarity with development and environmental issues in the&#13;
eastern Caribbean will be a definite asset. Highly developed oral and written&#13;
communication skills will be required, together with an ability to perform to a high&#13;
level with a minimum of supervision. The candidate should preferably have had some&#13;
experience of working in the Eastern Caribbean. Demonstrated ability to interface&#13;
effectively with government at senior staff and political levels will also be required&#13;
along with experience in dealing with international financial institutions (IFIs),&#13;
preferably through undertaking project implementation in a similar medium income or&#13;
developing region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
7.    The Financial Manager's position will require a Bachelor's degree in&#13;
accounting, financial management, economics or a related discipline; a post graduate&#13;
degree will be preferred. Extensive experience in financial management and&#13;
monitoring with an accounting background will be required, preferably including&#13;
work with IFIs on similar projects. In addition, experience with financial&#13;
management of a public utility company, authority or similar body would be an&#13;
advantage. Experience in the region as a whole and in the Eastern Caribbean in&#13;
particular would be an asset. The candidate should be fully computer literate in&#13;
accounting software packages, and will, under the overall guidance of the Project&#13;
Manager, be responsible for consolidating and reporting accounts received from the&#13;
implementing agencies for onward referral to the Bank and other IFIs involved in the&#13;
project. The Financial Manager will also be responsible for all accounting activities&#13;
associated with the Regional Component, and in advising the countries, as required on&#13;
accounting, fmancial management and cost recovery issues.&#13;
8.    The permanent support staff person will require formal secretarial, book-&#13;
keeping and/or office management training, together with several years of related&#13;
experience. Demonstrated word processing capability will be required, together with&#13;
a diplomatic phone manner and excellent oral communication skills.&#13;
9.    The permanent core of PMU staff will, from time to time, be supplemented by&#13;
a number of short term consultancies to undertake specific tasks. It is also envisaged&#13;
that additional assistance for a limited period will be required from other specialists&#13;
and particularly a procurement advisor who will join the PMU while equipment&#13;
procurement is being undertaken.&#13;
10.   All regional activities will be administered, monitored and coordinated through&#13;
the PMU. In addition all central reporting and monitoring from each country will be&#13;
routed through the PMU. In some cases PMU staff will undertake regional activities&#13;
itself, while in other cases the PMU will administer technical assistance contracts for&#13;
specific assignments (as indicated below).&#13;
PROJECT MAiNAGEiMENT SUPPORT&#13;
11.   The PMU (with additional expert advice as necessary), will be available to&#13;
assist countries in the procurement of equipment and in the detailed design of waste&#13;
management facilities. The PMU will maintain documentation and other information&#13;
relating to intemational competitive bidding (ICB) and regional bidding requirements.&#13;
The PMU may assist in the review of bids submitted in response to tender calls and in&#13;
the negotiation of contracts for the supply of equipment and civil works services.&#13;
12.   As the OECS Waste Management Project is implemented in each country, the&#13;
PMU will be available to assist countries in the contracting of professional expertise&#13;
for the detailed design of waste management facilities, specification writing and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
procurement, and in the administration of professional services contracts. Assistance&#13;
will also be available in the scheduling of activities, monitoring of progress toward&#13;
completion of activities and budgeting.&#13;
13.   In all cases, project management support to individual countries by the PMU&#13;
will be provided in response to requests for assistance by countries and in accordance&#13;
with the constraints placed on the Unit by its other responsibilities.&#13;
14.   In the period inmmediately preceding the establishment of the PMU, assistance&#13;
will be required by the countries in establishing their new solid waste management&#13;
institutional arrangements. Consequently, this component includes financial support&#13;
to the countries for the hire of the Solid Waste Manager and other activities required&#13;
to establish the new institutional framework in the six months prior to project&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
DEVELOPMENT/IMPLEMENTATION OF MODEL LEGISLATION&#13;
15.   The PMU will retain technical assistance expertise to develop model legislation&#13;
to underpin the effective implementation of the OECS Waste Management Project,&#13;
and provide a legislative framework for management and operation of the solid waste&#13;
systems in each country.&#13;
16.   The development of model legislation will result in a comprehensive suite of&#13;
legislative proposals that countries can adopt according to their own needs and timing&#13;
of implementation initiatives. The suite of proposals will represent the full&#13;
complement of legislation that a country will require to effectively implement its&#13;
waste management program. In addition, the legislative framework thus created in&#13;
each country will provide the operating guidelines and standards to which the solid&#13;
waste management companies, authorities or departments will have to perforn. This&#13;
legislation, and enforcement of the regulatory framework associated with it, will be&#13;
vital to the sustainability of improvements being introduced through the Project.&#13;
17.   All countries are likely to have implemented some aspects of the model&#13;
legislation to the extent dictated by their current circumstance. However, where other&#13;
legislative initiatives are required, countries will be able to adopt the relevant&#13;
provisions of the model legislation in the context of their own programs.&#13;
18.   The technical assistance consultant retained to draft model legislation should&#13;
ensure that the following are addressed:&#13;
requirements for the storage of wastes;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
contractual requirements for the performance of waste management&#13;
services where the management and/or delivery of services is through&#13;
an organization outside direct government control (i.e. guidelines for&#13;
the privatization of elements of the solid waste management services)&#13;
prohibitions and operating criteria for waste disposal sites;&#13;
planning requirements for future waste management activities and&#13;
initiatives;&#13;
monitoring and environmental performance standards for waste&#13;
management facilities; and&#13;
incentives/requirements for waste minimization, recycling and&#13;
composting. On this item, close liaison should be established between&#13;
the technical assistance consultant developing model legislation and the&#13;
technical assistance consultant addressing technical and marketing issues&#13;
associated with waste minimization, composting and recycling in the&#13;
region.&#13;
19.   In order to focus work undertaken to develop model legislation, priority areas&#13;
to be addressed in general and in specific countries are identified below. The&#13;
identification of these priority areas is intended to ensure that specific requirements&#13;
are addressed, but is not intended to limit the breadth of work necessary in drafting&#13;
model legislation:&#13;
All Countries&#13;
Legislation be established, and appropriate regulations enacted, to&#13;
require a National Solid Waste Management Plan for Antigua and&#13;
Barbuda and that responsibility for its implementation be given to the&#13;
appropriate authority (likely, the Ministry of Health). The Plan should&#13;
encompass waste minimization, collection, storage, disposal and other&#13;
important aspects of solid waste management, and should, if&#13;
appropriate, provide for tax incentives/disincentives to achieve&#13;
recycling/reduction goals. Standards related to landfills, storage and&#13;
collection should also be established, for application to the public and&#13;
private sectors. The legislation should establish financial and&#13;
institutional requirements and require their provision.&#13;
A system of licensing and monitoring of private sector waste&#13;
collectors/haulers be established and monitoring capabilities be put into&#13;
place (likely, under the Collection Supervisor).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
Anti-litter and anti-dumping enforcement capabilities under the Litter&#13;
Act and Public Health Act be considerably strengthened, by among&#13;
others, establishing and training a Cleaning/Anti-Litter Supervisor and&#13;
Litter Warden staff. Consideration should also be given to increasing&#13;
fines (where applicable).&#13;
The development of institutional arrangements to allow for the close&#13;
cooperation of Ministries (and where applicable local authorities)&#13;
concerned with waste management, and to confirm their relationship&#13;
with the new Solid Waste Management Entity, thereby promoting a&#13;
coordinated and more cost-effective approach to littering issues and&#13;
environmental education programming in particular.&#13;
Provision, under the Public Health (or similar) Act, be made to control&#13;
disposal of construction waste, derelict automobiles, etc., and that stiff&#13;
fines be imposed. It was noted that indiscriminate and uncontrolled&#13;
dumping of construction waste by private disposal companies represents&#13;
a serious issue that must be solved.&#13;
Antigua and Barbuda&#13;
The Development Control Authority be strengthened to develop and&#13;
enforce sound land use environmental planning policies, particularly, in&#13;
the context of this project, to oversee the Cooks landfill site and to&#13;
ensure that any expansion is consistent with environmental and planning&#13;
goals.&#13;
Dominica&#13;
The responsibility for overseeing Litter Act enforcement in national&#13;
parks and beach areas should be reviewed, as continued littering in&#13;
these areas hold undesirable consequences for a growing tourism&#13;
industry.&#13;
St. Lucia&#13;
The litter amendment bill should be used as a basis for promulgation of&#13;
legislation requiring a national solid waste management plan for St.&#13;
Lucia and that responsibility for its implementation be given to the&#13;
appropriate authority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
St. Vincent and the Grenadines&#13;
The Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines press for a strong&#13;
and united regional approach to monitoring and enforcement regarding&#13;
the disposal of ship-generated wastes.&#13;
20.   The preparation of model legislation will require expertise to be retained over&#13;
an initial nine month period during the first year of project implementation. Since the&#13;
execution of this assistance is vital to the effective operation of the system, it is&#13;
intended that this element will commence as soon as the Regional Component is&#13;
declared effective. In year three and year five of the project, technical assistance&#13;
should be retained to advise on the implementation of the model legislation, and to&#13;
recommend modifications on the basis of experience to date.&#13;
21.   As part of this initiative, full emphasis will be placed on assisting&#13;
Governments in ensuring that legislation and associated regulations and standards&#13;
adopted can be effectively enforced. In particular this will mean on-the-job assistance&#13;
and training (see below) to ensure that the limited resources available to police solid&#13;
waste management operations in the countries are efficiently and effectively utilized.&#13;
IDENTIFICATION OF MARKETS FOR COMPOSTABLE AND RECYCLABLE&#13;
MATERIALS&#13;
22.   Technical assistance expertise should be retained to develop specific markets&#13;
for compostable and recyclable materials, and to assist in waste minimization.&#13;
23.   Composting, recycling and waste minimization opportunities have been&#13;
identified for inclusion in this project, and potential markets for recyclable materials&#13;
have been identified. In order to move composting and recycling programs forward,&#13;
it is necessary for regional initiatives to include the development of terms and&#13;
conditions under which recyclable materials will be accepted by end-use markets, and&#13;
to initiate application of composting. For recyclable materials, it is likely that the&#13;
most favorable terms and conditions can be developed on a regional basis rather than&#13;
on a country-specific basis, since volumes of material delivered to an end-user will be&#13;
maximnized this way.&#13;
24.   Recycling. The technical assistance consultant should develop options for the&#13;
sale of recyclable materials to end-use markets, with particular focus on:&#13;
the specifications associated with the sale of recyclable materials.&#13;
These can be highly technical, and it will be necessary that all countries&#13;
become familiar with the limitations and opportunities afforded by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
particular specifications and the implications of varying specifications&#13;
on the value of material and the quantity of material that can be&#13;
recycled;&#13;
transportation costs. End-use markets can sometimes assist with&#13;
transportation costs if the volumes of material are sufficiently great.&#13;
Transportation costs can vary greatly according to the volume of&#13;
material shipped;&#13;
end-users and brokers of materials. End-users will normally pay higher&#13;
prices for materials than brokers, who take a percentage of the sale&#13;
price of material as a sales commission. For this reason, it is&#13;
economically more attractive to establish a relationship with an end-&#13;
user. However, the contractual agreements that end-users have with&#13;
brokers may prevent the end-user accepting materials from any&#13;
organization in a region except the broker. In addition, brokers may&#13;
have ready access to markets that are otherwise unknown or&#13;
inaccessible to OECS countries. Trade in recyclable materials is global&#13;
and materials generated in the western hemisphere may be recycled in&#13;
Asia, Africa or Europe; although preference may be given to local and&#13;
regional markets, brokers may be able to provide a wider context to&#13;
recycling.&#13;
delivery schedules for recyclable materials. Many end users require a&#13;
minimum amount of material to be delivered on a fixed schedule and&#13;
financial penalties may apply if this schedule is not adhered to. Clarity&#13;
will be required from end-users and brokers regarding these issues.&#13;
length of contract. Contracts for recyclable materials are renewable,&#13;
but the terrn of renewal influence the price a broker or end-user will&#13;
pay for material. Short-term contracts should generally be avoided,&#13;
although they can offer attractive prices, since a recycling program&#13;
built around a short term contract has no long term security.&#13;
25.   Development of markets may conclude at this point with letters of&#13;
understanding regarding the terms and conditions of a recycling contract. These can&#13;
then be used as a basis for development of specific recycling programs and the&#13;
signing of contracts by recycling program operators.&#13;
26.   The results of this work should be communicated to governments and the&#13;
private sector. This can most effectively be done through the distribution of reports&#13;
and findings to stakeholders in each country, and through regional meetings. Subject&#13;
to the opportunities identified and other factors, it may be appropriate for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
technical assistance consultant to assist in the development of regional approaches to&#13;
recycling.&#13;
27.   Composting. The technical assistance consultant should work with Ministries&#13;
of Health and Agriculture in each country to identify compost applications and to&#13;
implement composting activity, consistent with the recommendations of the&#13;
documentation prepared in support of this project.&#13;
28.   Waste Minimization. The technical assistance consultant should work with&#13;
each country to implement the waste minimization recommendations contained&#13;
elsewhere in the documentation associated with this project.&#13;
29.   The completion of these tasks will require expertise to be retained during the&#13;
initial year of the project. Expertise should also be retained during year two and year&#13;
four of the project to assist with implementation of composting and recycling&#13;
initiatives and to recommend modifications on the basis of experience.&#13;
TRAINING&#13;
30.   Training requirements associated with the implementation of all aspects of the&#13;
OECS Waste Management Program have been detailed elsewhere in documentation&#13;
for this project. Technical assistance expertise should be retained to develop a&#13;
regional training program to meet these requirements.&#13;
31.   Based on training needs and requirements identified in the documentation&#13;
prepared in support of this project, technical assistance expertise should be used to:&#13;
-     detail training programs for executive, managerial and technical staff.&#13;
Particular attention is to be paid to matching training requirements to&#13;
measurable outputs from training;&#13;
-     identification of overseas training courses, where recommended in&#13;
documentation associated with this project, and recommendation of&#13;
preferred training course;&#13;
-     identification/creation of local training courses, where recommended in&#13;
documentation associated with this project;&#13;
-     co-ordinate the implementation and delivery of the required training&#13;
courses in year one of the project.&#13;
32.   For Enforcement Officer training, it will be important to ensure training is&#13;
provided in port state control of international maritime regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
33.   The completion of these tasks will require expertise to be retained during the&#13;
initial year of the project. Expertise should also be retained during year three and&#13;
year five of the project to recommend and design modifications to the training&#13;
program on the basis of experience.&#13;
REGIONAL WORKSHOP&#13;
34.   Regional workshops should be organized and coordinated at the regional level&#13;
during the first 5 years of project implementation. Workshops should be held on:&#13;
-     port waste management;&#13;
-     project implementation issues;&#13;
-     landfill design and operation issues:&#13;
waste minimization, composting and recycling;&#13;
waste management system administration.&#13;
35.   Workshops should be held twice yearly. It is likely that two workshops will&#13;
be required on each topic during the five year period.&#13;
36.   Workshops should be organized by the PMU. They can be held in different&#13;
countries and, in addition to offering the exchange of informnation among countries,&#13;
will be able to showcase the achievements of the host country. The tasks to be&#13;
undertaken to implement the workshop are as follows:&#13;
-     identify a venue;&#13;
-     identify the areas of focus of the workshop;&#13;
-     invite presentations from OECS and other countries;&#13;
-     invite people to participate in the workshop;&#13;
-     organize workshop logistics (food, accommnodation etc.);&#13;
-     organize workshop schedule;&#13;
-     ensure the successful functioning of the workshop.&#13;
37.   The implementation of the workshops has been budgeted, see below, to allow&#13;
two people from each country to attend each workshop for two days.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
WASTE MANAGEMENT DOCIUMIENTATION PREPARATION AND&#13;
MONITORING&#13;
38.   Ships intending to land waste at OECS ports will be required to provide&#13;
information on their intention and on the volume, type and form of waste to be landed&#13;
as part of their on-board "waste management plan".&#13;
Documentation of Ship-Generated Waste&#13;
39.   Forrns common to all countries are required for the documentation of waste&#13;
management plans and the verification that plans are adhered to when ships enter a&#13;
port. A "Waste Management Plan" form should be developed that requires the&#13;
applicant to:&#13;
-     identify the name, size and registry of the vessel;&#13;
-     identify the number of passengers and crew on the vessel;&#13;
-     identify the types of waste generated on the vessel;&#13;
-     detail how food, food contaminated and food contact waste will be&#13;
managed on the vessel;&#13;
detail how other wastes will be managed on the vessel;&#13;
detail the equipment used to manage all wastes;&#13;
identify how wastes will be landed (compacted, incinerated etc.).&#13;
40.   The form should be signed by a signing officer for the shipping line and&#13;
should make clear that upon acceptance of the plan detailed on the completed form by&#13;
the respective countries, the plan will become legally binding.&#13;
41.   A "Waste Management Plan Verification Form" is also required. This form&#13;
should be set-up in a check-list format so that the inspection officer can check off the&#13;
items addressed in the Waste Management Plan as being either complied with or not&#13;
complied with. Space should be allowed for the inspection officer to briefly elaborate&#13;
on areas of non-compliance. Space should be allowed for the inspection officer to&#13;
sign the form. The form should be prepared as a duplicate on pressure sensitive&#13;
paper so that the inspection officer can leave a copy with the ship's captain at the end&#13;
of the inspection and return the original to the file.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
Monitoring of Ship-Generated Waste Management Systems&#13;
42.   Information should be gathered on a semi-monthly basis from each country&#13;
regarding the implementation of the ship-generated waste management system. A&#13;
brief report should be prepared twice per year that sumnmarizes the experience of&#13;
countries in this area and the report should be distributed to countries. The intent of&#13;
the report will be to assist countries in the implementation of these systems through&#13;
the dissemination of information regarding problems that have been encountered and&#13;
solutions that have been found.&#13;
Waste Management System Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
43.   The monitoring and evaluation of the waste management system in each&#13;
country should be undertaken. Monitoring and evaluation can be of two types:&#13;
monitoring progress in implementation measured against the&#13;
implementation schedule developed, and evaluating how problems can&#13;
be overcome;&#13;
monitoring benefits achieved through the project and evaluating these&#13;
against benefits projected to occur.&#13;
44.   The former type of monitoring and evaluation should be undertaken by the&#13;
PMU as part of its overall project management function.&#13;
45.   An independent view is required to collate and report on the second type of&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, and technical assistance expertise should be retained in&#13;
each year of the project for this purpose. At the outset of the first year, the technical&#13;
assistant consultant retained to perform the required analyses should establish a&#13;
monitoring and evaluation framework and should establish the benchmarks that will be&#13;
used to monitor and evaluate the benefits of the project. Data included in the&#13;
documentation prepared in support of this project may be used, and additional&#13;
benchmarks may be selected.&#13;
46.   The types of factor that could be considered for monitoring and evaluation&#13;
include, but are not necessarily limited to:&#13;
incidence of overflowing waste containers;&#13;
incidence of complaints regarding the waste management system;&#13;
incidence of flies/vermin at landfill sites;&#13;
incidence of beach liter;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
amount of international waste landed;&#13;
amount of domestic waste collected and properly managed;&#13;
percentage of time collection schedules are adhered to.&#13;
47.   Broader measures of benefit, such as health benefits, may also be used, but&#13;
these can be difficult to applv because appropriate baseline data may not be available&#13;
against which to monitor and evaluate and because manv benefits associated with the&#13;
project may not be fully apparent until following the project.&#13;
DEVELOPMIENT OF MODEL ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAM&#13;
48.   A model environmental education program should be developed for use by&#13;
OECS countries. The program will be placed in a broad environmental education&#13;
context, but will focus on specific waste management issues including:&#13;
-     how wastes impact on land and marine environments;&#13;
-     why wastes are generated;&#13;
-     what types of activity generate what types of waste;&#13;
-     how wastes can become resources;&#13;
-     ways that residents can reduce their waste;&#13;
-     what is being done in OECS countries to improve the management of wastes.&#13;
49.   The program should be developed to build upon on-going regional and national&#13;
initiatives in this area, and should maximize the use of materials already developed in&#13;
the region by, for example, OECS-NRMU, Caribbean Environmental Heal Institute,&#13;
and the Caribbean Conservation Association.&#13;
FINANCING AND ACCOUNTABILITY&#13;
50.   The activities of the PMU and the Regional Component will be supported by&#13;
the GEF through the World Bank directly, and budget requirements will be allocated&#13;
to each country. The contribution of each country has been calculated based on the&#13;
requirements of each from the Regional Component. A time-based budget is&#13;
presented in Table Jl. The approximate annual allocation of the total budget to&#13;
individual countries is shown in Table J2; these allocations are also reflected, as&#13;
appropriate, in the project financing tables of each OECS country. Timing associated&#13;
with regional activities is displayed in the time-based action plans included in each&#13;
Country Appendix. Table J3 shows the disbursement schedule for the sewerage&#13;
technical assistance component which is also GEF funded.&#13;
51.   As an operating unit within the OECS Waste M9anagement Project, the PMU&#13;
will be accountable to member countries. The PMU will produce a brief Annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
Report of its activities to be submitted to member countries. The Unit will exist for&#13;
the five year period conmmencing in 1995; following this period, member countries&#13;
will evaluate whether they wish to retain the Unit and, if so, what its Terms of&#13;
Reference will be and how it will be financed.&#13;
52.    Regional initiatives should be undertaken within the context of national&#13;
requirements. It is therefore necessary that a regional presence be created during the&#13;
undertaking of these initiatives, but it is not necessary that this presence should exist&#13;
as a discrete entity once regional undertakings have been completed and national&#13;
programs are well established. Consequently, all regional activities are proposed to&#13;
be completed within 5 years - with the majority completed well before that Table J4-&#13;
at which time regional activities will cease at the level of the OECS Secretariat&#13;
(unless the countries themselves decide to retain the unit). At that time, continued&#13;
regional co-ordination and discussions will still be required, but can best be&#13;
accomplished through regional committees made up of representatives from national&#13;
programs.&#13;

ANNEX K&#13;
OECS WASTE MANAGENENT PROJECT:&#13;
GENERIC TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR DETAILED LANDFILL&#13;
DESIGN IN SUPPORT OF LANDFILL SITE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
BID DOCULMENTS&#13;
Preface&#13;
The work described in these Terms Of Reference should be undertaken in accordance with, and&#13;
consistent with, the final project preparation report of the Regional Environmental Project For&#13;
The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States: Solid Waste Management Component, also&#13;
referred to as the OECS Waste Management Project preparation report, prepared by the&#13;
Canadian Marine Waste Management Collaborative dated August 1994.&#13;
Landfill sites to be developed under the OECS Waste Management Project vary considerably in&#13;
the details of their design requirements, as detailed in the Final Report for The OECS Waste&#13;
Management Project. For example access road widths, the slope of final contours and leachate&#13;
control/collection vary from landfill to landfill, as do many other factors. In various places in&#13;
the Generic Terms Of Reference that follow, the notation [INSERT ....] has been used where&#13;
countries should insert the specific detail necessary for the design of their landfill site(s). In&#13;
some cases, some design requirements for a specific landfill may not be reflected in these&#13;
Generic Terms Of Reference since those aspects do not pertain generally to landfills required&#13;
by OECS countries. In other cases, some items may be included in these Generic Terms Of&#13;
Reference that pertain to most landfills to be developed under the OECS Waste Management&#13;
Project, but not to all landfills. These Generic Terms Of Reference are therefore presented&#13;
as an aid to the preparation of detailed landfill design terms of reference by countries and&#13;
do not substitute for detailed landfill design terms of reference for specific landfills in&#13;
specific countries. It remains the responsibility of countries to draft both detailed landfill&#13;
design terms of reference that reflect the specific requirements of specific landfills.&#13;
Generic Terms Of Reference&#13;
Requirements for completion under these Generic Terms of Reference are grouped under Survey&#13;
And Plan Requirements, Component Design Requirements, Standards and Procurement.&#13;
Survev And Plan Requirements&#13;
1.    Top~o graphic Survey Topographic surveys will be undertaken to prepare accurate and&#13;
detailed topographic characterisation of all lands within and immediately adjacent to the&#13;
landfill site. Specifically, the topographic survey will identify and plot:&#13;
the boundary of the landfill site;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
143&#13;
elevations within the landfill site at sufficient locations to characterize slopes of&#13;
the terrain;&#13;
elevations outside the landfill site to characterize slopes of terrain on which the&#13;
landfill access road will be located and on which any other facilities associated&#13;
with the design and operation of the landfill will be located (e.g introduction of&#13;
utilities);&#13;
the boundary of the width of the landfill access road and associated drainage&#13;
installations;&#13;
significant breaks of slope adjacent to the landfill site boundary;&#13;
natural features within the landfill site including, but not necessarily limited to,&#13;
watercourses (perennial and seasonal), swamps or marshes (perennial and&#13;
seasonal) and types of vegetation cover.&#13;
A survey plan of the area surveyed will be prepared at a scale of 1:2500.&#13;
NOTE:        This task should be undertaken by Government in each country and&#13;
plans, results and data should be made available to the design&#13;
engineer).&#13;
2.    Hvdrogeological Survev Hydrogeological surveys will be undertaken, as necessary, to&#13;
determine potential for excavation within the landfill site in order to increase the capacity&#13;
of the landfill and to provide cover materials for the landfill.  In addition,&#13;
hydrogeological surveys will address requirements identified in the preliminary&#13;
hydrogeological investigations undertaken in support of the preparation of the OECS&#13;
Waste Management Project. Geotechnical assessments will be undertaken at the landfill&#13;
site to support the application of a synthetic liner if a synthetic liner is included in the&#13;
conceptual design detailed in the preparation of the OECS Waste Management Project.&#13;
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following will be undertaken:&#13;
quantify potential for excavation within the landfill to increase landfill capacity&#13;
and to provide cover materials for the landfill;&#13;
address specific hydrogeological requirements consistent with recommendations&#13;
of the preliminary hydrogeological investigations undertaken in support of the&#13;
preparation of the OECS Waste Management Project [INSERT DETAILS&#13;
TAKEN FROM RELEVANT REPORT TO ITEMIZE THESE&#13;
REQUIREMENTS].&#13;
where the OECS Waste Management Project preparation reports recommend the&#13;
installation of a liner, undertake compaction and other geotechnical assessments&#13;
of native soils necessary to finalize detailed design and specifications for synthetic&#13;
liner installation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
144&#13;
3.     Conceptual Lavout  Using survey plan data, the volume of the landfill will be&#13;
determined. The volume of the landfill will be expressed in cubic yards and in terms of&#13;
the number of years that the landfill will be able to receive waste before reaching its&#13;
design capacity. The capacity of the landfill will be identified on the basis of landfilling&#13;
all waste materials generated in the areas from which waste will be collected, as&#13;
identified in the OECS Waste Management Project Report. Engineering drawings will&#13;
be prepared identifying:&#13;
the area to be landfilled;&#13;
areas on which ancillary landfill structures (e.g. site office, storage buildings and&#13;
other facilities identified in Item 8 below) are to be sited;&#13;
areas required for berm construction and other buffering structures between the&#13;
landfill and adjacent land uses;&#13;
the access road;&#13;
cover material storage area, as appropriate;&#13;
adjacent land uses.&#13;
4.    Landfill Footrrints Footprints will be prepared of the landfill as it will be:&#13;
following construction but before receiving refuse;&#13;
at every 10 foot increment in height;&#13;
following closure and capping of the completed landfill.&#13;
Footprints will be prepared at a scale of 1:2500.&#13;
Component Desian Requirements&#13;
5.    Access Road Detailed designs will be prepared for the access road into the landfill. The&#13;
route the access road will follow will be confirmned with the Client prior to undertaking&#13;
this task. The access road will be [INSERT] feet in width. In both subgrade and surface&#13;
design, the access road will be designed for all-weather use. Surface water drainage from&#13;
the road will be provided by cross slope not exceeding 2.5%. The access road will be&#13;
designed to accommodate vehicles of up to [INSERT] tons in weight. Water course&#13;
crossings will be by standard culvert where the watercourse does not support fish habitat&#13;
and by bottomless watercourse crossing structures where the watercourse supports fish&#13;
habitat. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, detailed design of the access&#13;
road will include, but not necessarily be limited to:&#13;
preparation of design and specification of sub-grade;&#13;
preparation of design and specification of road surface;&#13;
preparation and specification of surface water drainage elements;&#13;
preparation and specification of watercourse crossing structures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
145&#13;
6.    On-Site Roads Detailed designs will be prepared for on-site roads allowing access to&#13;
different parts of the landfill.  These roads will be temporary and their creation,&#13;
alignment and closure will be a function of the filling sequence in the landfill. On-site&#13;
roads leading to the working face of the landfill will be 20 feet in width and will be&#13;
constructed of granular material. Inclines should not exceed a 10% slope and the cross-&#13;
slope should not exceed 2.5 %. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, detailed&#13;
design of the on-site roads should include, but not necessarily be limited to:&#13;
specification of sub-grade compaction requirements;&#13;
specification of road surface requirements.&#13;
7.    Landfill Base And Leachate Collection  Detailed designs and specifications will be&#13;
prepared for the construction of the base of the landfill. Specifications will be developed&#13;
for the clearing, grubbing, excavating, compaction and preparation (as necessary) of&#13;
ground surfaces for landfill site development. Final grade specifications for the base of&#13;
the landfill will include a slope of not less than 3 % in the direction(s) in which leachate&#13;
will be collected and a slope of not less than 1 % in the direction(s) in which leachate will&#13;
be carried following collection. Detailed design and specifications will also include&#13;
provision of berms around the perimeter of the landfill site where feasible and where&#13;
necessary to buffer landfill operations from public view. Berms may be constructed of&#13;
solid waste capped with a low permeability cover material.&#13;
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, design of the base of the landfill should&#13;
include, but not necessarily be limited to:&#13;
specification of clearing and grubbing requirements;&#13;
specification of the extent of required excavation, infilling, compaction and base&#13;
preparation to accommodate the synthetic liner/leachate collection system&#13;
identified in the OECS Waste Management Project preparation report [INSERT&#13;
REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED IN THE "COUNTRY APPENDIX" TO THAT&#13;
REPORT, AND ANY RELEVANT SITING/DESIGN CORRESPONDENCE OR&#13;
REPORTS COMPLETED SUBSEQUENT TO THAT REPORT];&#13;
specification of requirements, as necessary, of suitable base materials to support&#13;
the installation and operation of synthetic liners/leachate collection structures&#13;
[INSERT REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED IN THE "COUNTRY APPENDIX"&#13;
TO THAT REPORT, AND ANY RELEVANT SITING/DESIGN&#13;
CORRESPONDENCE OR REPORTS COMPLETED SUBSEQUENT TO THAT&#13;
REPORT];&#13;
specification and preparation of detailed desians for the installation of synthetic&#13;
liners/leachate collection structures consistent with those identified in the OECS&#13;
Waste Management Project preparation report [INSERT REQUIREMENTS&#13;
IDENTIFIED IN THE "COUNTRY APPENDIX" TO THAT REPORT, AND&#13;
ANY RELEVANT SITING/DESIGN CORRESPONDENCE OR REPORTS&#13;
COMPLETED SUBSEQUENT TO THAT REPORT];&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
146&#13;
specification of protocols for the installation of synthetic liners/leachate collection&#13;
systems identified in the OECS Waste Management Project preparation report;&#13;
specification of requirements for the installation of a protective layer of material&#13;
over the synthetic liner/leachate collection system identified in the OECS Waste&#13;
Management Project preparation report [INSERT REQUIREMENTS&#13;
IDENTIFIED IN THE "COUNTRY APPENDIX" TO THAT REPORT, AND&#13;
ANY RELEVANT SITING/DESIGN CORRESPONDENCE OR REPORTS&#13;
COMPLETED SUBSEQUENT TO THAT REPORT].&#13;
8.    Sucace And Storm  Water Management Detailed designs will be prepared for the&#13;
management of surface water and storm water. All watercourses, seasonal or perennial,&#13;
that flow across the landfill will be diverted by means of cut-off drains constructed&#13;
upgradient from the landfill. Cut-off drains will be designed to be sufficient to carry&#13;
peak surface water flows during the rainy season away from the landfill site to [INSERT&#13;
POINT TO WHICH CUT-OFF DRAINS WILL CARRY SURFACE WATER].&#13;
[INSERT NEED FOR PERIMETER DRAINS FOR MANAGEMENT OF SURFACE&#13;
WATER AND STORMI WATER, AS IDENTIFIED IN OECS WASTE&#13;
MANAGEMENT PROJECT PREPARATION REPORT OR AS REQUIRED FOR&#13;
EFFECTIVE SURFACE WATER AND STORM WATER MANAGEMENT]. The&#13;
discharge point for cut-off and perimeter drains will be into the natural environment at&#13;
such point and in such manner as not to adversely affect the local environment or human&#13;
activities.&#13;
9.    On-Site Facilities Detailed designs and specifications will be prepared for the ground&#13;
preparation, installation and construction of the site office/weighbridge, landfill&#13;
equipment storage shed, MARPOL V bin washer, hazardous waste storage facility, used&#13;
tyre slicer, car crusher, waste oil storage tank and provision of potable water supply and&#13;
septic tank. The design of each of these facilities will include provision for drainage of&#13;
storm water away from the facilities and away from the area(s) where landfilling will&#13;
take place or has been completed. Not all of these items are required at all landfills.&#13;
Site Office/Weizhbridge The site office will consist of one office, a washroom equipped&#13;
with one toilet and one basin, and a store room. The office floor plan will measure 15&#13;
feet by 15 feet in exterior dimension. The washroom floor plan will measure 8 feet by&#13;
8 feet in exterior dimension. The store room floor plan will measure 8 feet by 8 feet in&#13;
exterior dimension. All rooms will be constructed of concrete block set on concrete slab&#13;
floor with concrete footings adequate to support the structure. The roof will be pitched&#13;
at 22.50. The structure will be set adjacent to the access road entrance to the landfill&#13;
site. The surface of the floor of the structure will be set 3 feet above road grade. A&#13;
sliding window, minimum measurement 2 feet by 2 feet, will be installed into the side&#13;
of the site office facing the access road entrance to the landfill site so as to permit site&#13;
office staff easy communication with vehicle drivers entering or leaving the landfill site&#13;
and so as to allow site office staff to hand receipts to vehicle drivers. Doors will be&#13;
provided for entry to each room. Except as identified above, all construction of the site&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
147&#13;
office, washroom and storage shed will be undertaken to local construction norms&#13;
approved by the Government of [INSERT NAME OF COUNTRY].&#13;
The design engineer will consult with the supplier of the weighbridge and include in the&#13;
designs for the landfill such designs, specifications and allowances as are required for the&#13;
installation and operation of the weighbridge.&#13;
Landfill Equipment Storage Shed A landfill equipment storage shed will be designed and&#13;
specified to accommodate the storage of [INSERT NUMBER OF THE LANDFILL&#13;
TRACTORS/COMPACTORS/BULLDOZERS/COVER MATERIAL APPLICATORS&#13;
INCLUDED IN THE OPERATION OF THE LANDFILL]. The storage shed will be&#13;
open-sided and should consist of a pitched roof supported by posts set on concrete&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            TThe Solid Waste Management Project is
            to be the first in a series of environmentally-oriented
            activities which will ensure the future maintenance of
            environmental quality in the Organization of Eastern
            Caribbean States (OECS) countries. The objective of this
            operation is to reduce public health risks and protect the
            environmental integrity of the island and their costal and
            marine systems, by improving domestic solid waste management
            facilities and facilitating compliance with the
            "Special Area" designation of the Caribbean Sea.
            The project will reduce terrestrial and marine pollution in
            this area through avoiding and discouraging indiscriminate
            disposal of solid waste both on and off shore. A further
            objective is to significantly enhance public health and
            environmental quality by strengthening the countries'
            capacities to effectively manage and dispose of solid waste
            in an environmentally sustainable manner. More specifically,
            project objectives are to assist the OECS governments to:
            (a) improve the coverage and effectiveness of domestic solid
            waste collection and disposal facilities; (b) reduce
            pollution of international and territorial waters caused by
