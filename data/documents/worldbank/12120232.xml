            Managing resource rents : the special
            challenges in postconflict countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Resource flows from extractive
            industries can be a lifeline for postconflict countries,
            helping to fund critical reconstruction needs. But these
            resources present issues not found elsewhere in the economy
            and need to be well managed. Sector governance principles
            that apply to oil-producing countries in general are even
            more important in postconflict countries. This note
            discusses these principles and shows how they apply in two
            cases, Timor-Leste and Sudan.
