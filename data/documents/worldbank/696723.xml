TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
IN SUPPORT OF ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Chapter 1. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
1. 1.   The overall aim of the Technical Assistance Project is to support the Government's enterprise&#13;
and financial sector reform program which will be supported by the Enterprise and Financial Sector&#13;
Adjustment Loan currently under preparation. Specifically, the objectives of the project are:&#13;
(i)   to assist the Government to complete the privatization of former socially-owned&#13;
enterprises;&#13;
(ii)   to help in the restructuring and privatization of public enterprises through studies and&#13;
advisory services; and&#13;
(iii)  to support the rehabilitation and privatization of the banking system.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
1.2.   The proposed project will provide consulting services for studies and advisory services in the&#13;
form of short and long-term technical assistance. The total cost of the project is US$6.2 million, of&#13;
which US$5 million will be financed by the Bank. The project will be implemented over a period of&#13;
two years by the beneficiary agencies, under the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
Chapter 2. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Agreements Between the Borrower and Beneficiary Agencies&#13;
2.1    The Borrower is the Government of the Republic of Croatia (GOC) represented by its&#13;
Ministry of Finance (MOF). It has been agreed that the MOF will delegate the implementation&#13;
responsibility to the beneficiary agencies. The MOF's Project Coordinator (PC) will be responsible&#13;
primarily for monitoring and reporting on project activities. Implementation of the project will be the&#13;
responsibility of the beneficiary agencies.&#13;
B. Responsibilities of Beneficiary Agencies&#13;
2.2    The following agencies will be responsible for the activities to be implemented under the&#13;
project. (Chapter 4 of this Annex gives details of project activities.) As described briefly in the&#13;
following paragraphs, experts will be financed by the loan to ensure the agencies receive adequate&#13;
support to carry out their privatization and restructuring activities. Two of the agencies, the Ministry&#13;
of Privatization and ORESE, have already shown the capacity to implement the Bank procurement&#13;
procedures, having undertaken the process for four contracts that will be eligible for the retroactive&#13;
financing arrangement under the loan (see paras. 4.2 - 4.3). Training in Bank procurement has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
already been offered to some staff of these agencies and will be offered to other staff as needed to&#13;
facilitate smooth project implementation.&#13;
(i)    Ministry of Finance (MOF). Overall responsibility for coordination and reporting&#13;
will rest with the Ministry of Finance. The Project Coordinator (PC) will be shared&#13;
with the Capital Market Development Project (CMDP), under which financing is&#13;
allocated for this purpose. The PC will be selected and financed under an advance&#13;
from the Project Preparation Facility for the CMDP and is expected to be in place&#13;
before the TA loan effectiveness. The Project Coordinator will have extensive project&#13;
management experience and will be trained in Bank procurement and disbursement&#13;
procedures.  The PC will reside in the Ministry of Finance to monitor project&#13;
implementation and disbursements, assist the beneficiary agencies in the procurement&#13;
process as needed, keep project accounts and make periodic reports to the&#13;
Government and the Bank. Project activities will be implemented by the beneficiary&#13;
agencies which will be expected to report back to the Project Coordinator on a&#13;
monthly basis. In each beneficiary agency, a contact person has been identified to act&#13;
as liaison and to report to the PC.&#13;
(ii)    The Ministry of Economy (MOE) will be responsible for all studies concerning the&#13;
power sector. Ministry officials will establish the final workplan for consultants and&#13;
will supervise their work. Preparation of various studies will require input from the&#13;
state power company, HEP; this work will be supervised by the Ministry of&#13;
Economy. Finally the MOE will receive advice on certain aspects of restructuring of&#13;
complex industrial enterprises.&#13;
(iii)   The Ministry of Maritine Affairs, Transport and Communications will be&#13;
responsible for studies in the telecommunications sector. This Ministry will supervise&#13;
the State telecommunications company's input for the tariff studies.&#13;
(iv)   The Ministry  of Privatization (MOP) is responsible for elaboration of the&#13;
privatization policy (including preparation of legislation and regulations) and&#13;
preparation of the detailed strategy (including "mapping" of privatization, launching&#13;
the public awareness campaign, and promotion with foreign investors). The MOP&#13;
will supervise experts who will advise on various aspects of privatization.&#13;
(v)    The Croatian Privatization Fund (CPF) is the "sui generis" state Agency,&#13;
responsible for privatization of the former socially-owned enterprises (as opposed to&#13;
public enterprises). It is also responsible for exercising ownership functions on behalf&#13;
of the State for enterprise shares and other selected assets still under Govermnent&#13;
ownership, while waiting for their privatization. The CPF will supervise experts who&#13;
will advise on privatization transactions and improvement of CPF's internal&#13;
operations.&#13;
(vi)   The Government Office for Restructuring  and  Economics of State-owned&#13;
Enterprises (ORESE) was set up mainly to monitor the performance of large public&#13;
enterprises particularly by reviewing and analyzing their financial performance and&#13;
assisting them in the preparation and implementation of restructuring programs&#13;
(including privatization in selected cases). ORESE reports to the Government through&#13;
the Vice-Prime Minister in charge of Economic Affairs.  ORESE will receive&#13;
financial analysis and audit expertise and will supervise studies of various activities of&#13;
INA, the petrochemical company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
(vii)  The Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA) will implement the Government's program&#13;
of rehabilitation for banks.  The BRA will be responsible for:  (a) taking over,&#13;
rehabilitating and privatizing at least five troubled banks, including the largest&#13;
Croatian bank; (b) cleaning up troubled banks' balance sheets, and managing selected&#13;
non-performing assets; and (c) developing a deposit insurance fund. The BRA will&#13;
receive accounting, financial and legal advisory services and expertise in bank&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
C. Functions of the Project Coordinator&#13;
2.3    The  Project Coordinator who reports directly to the Assistant Minister of Finance will be&#13;
responsible for monitoring project activities. Staff of the beneficiary agencies who will work in close&#13;
cooperation with the PC have been identified. The functions of the Project Coordinator are:&#13;
(i)  to oversee project activities to ensure the successful and timely implementation of the&#13;
project by the various beneficiary agencies;&#13;
(ii)  to  monitor project expenditures and costs (local and foreign), process loan&#13;
disbursement applications, and track disbursements of the Bank loan;&#13;
(iii)  to ensure the preparation and distribution of consolidated periodic reports to the&#13;
relevant Government and other participating institutions, including the Bank,&#13;
reflecting: (a) the status of implementation progress, problems encountered and&#13;
corrective actions needed; and (b) current costs of each project component and&#13;
estimated costs of completion;&#13;
(iv)  to ensure the timely preparation and submission to relevant Government institutions&#13;
and the Bank of annual audit reports of project expenditures and accounts;&#13;
(v)  to review and revise implementation targets and financial resources needed to support&#13;
future actions; and&#13;
(vi)  to ensure the preparation of the Government's contribution to the Implementation&#13;
Completion Report (ICR) within six months after the completion of the project.&#13;
D. Implenentation Arrangements&#13;
2.4    The beneficiary agencies - the Ministry of Privatization, CPF, ORESE, BRA, Ministry of&#13;
Economy and Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications - will be responsible for&#13;
implementation of the project which consists of the hiring and supervision of consultants for studies&#13;
and advisory services. Each agency will be responsible for its own procurement process and will&#13;
report to the Project Coordinator the results of contract implementation and timing, and any necessary&#13;
support for future actions.  To date, the Ministry of Privatization and ORESE have started&#13;
procurement for the services of consultants to act as advisors and undertake studies (see paras. 4.2 -&#13;
4.3). The procurement process followed has been in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency in order that these&#13;
contracts may be considered for financing under the retroactive financing arrangement of the proposed&#13;
project. These beneficiary agencies have shown the capacity to follow the guidelines with moderate&#13;
supervision by the Bank. For this reason it is expected that the process will go smoothly for other&#13;
services to be procured by these agencies. Procurement training will be given as needed to staff of&#13;
the other agencies to ensure smooth implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
E. Role of the Bank&#13;
2.5    The project will, on average, require about 14 staffweeks of Bank supervision per year during&#13;
implementation, as proposed in the supervision plan below. In addition, supervision of the Technical&#13;
Assistance project will be jointly performed with EFSAL supervision. Consequently, the TA project&#13;
will also benefit from the expertise of the specialists who, in the context of preparation and&#13;
supervision of the EFSAL and in conjunction with the beneficiary agencies, will supervise the work&#13;
of the consultants financed by the TA loan.&#13;

F. Administrative Arrangements&#13;
2.6    The Project Coordinator will be responsible for carrying out all necessary administrative&#13;
arrangements recommended and approved by the Government and the Bank. At the outset of the&#13;
project, the PC will focus on development and implementation of the new administrative systems.&#13;
Chapter 3. PROJECT FINANCING AND COSTS&#13;
A. Detailed Financing Plan&#13;
3.1    The estimated total cost of the project is US$6.2 million, net of taxes and duties (as agreed by&#13;
the Government), including price contingencies.   The foreign component is US$5.6 million,&#13;
equivalent to 91 percent of total project costs.  The Bank loan of US$5 million will finance&#13;
approximately 81 percent of the total project costs, comprising about 81 percent of foreign exchange&#13;
cost (about US$4.5 million), and 79 percent of local cost. The Government has received an advance&#13;
of US$800,000 from the Bank's Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to finance audits of nine banks.&#13;
3.2    The Government has shown its commitment to the project objectives by financing about&#13;
US$1.2 million, the balance of project costs. This comprises three contracts for INA -- a detailed&#13;
analysis of its hydrocarbon chain, preparation of a strategic restructuring and privatization program&#13;
and the financial audit of the group. In addition, the Croatian Privatization Fund will finance the first&#13;
two phases of its reorganization. The financing plan is shown in Tables 1 and 2.&#13;

preparation of a strategic restructuring and privatization program and (3) the financial audit of the group; financed by the&#13;
CPF -- Phases 1 &amp; 2 of the CPF's reorganization.&#13;
3.5     Technical Assistance.  Qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals for consultant&#13;
services in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and&#13;
by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). To keep the evaluation process manageable,&#13;
no more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited following a short list acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. It is estimated that technical assistance will be procured in 16 packages at a total cost of about&#13;
US$4.2 million (excluding the PPF advance). It is estimated that about US$300,000 of the aggregate&#13;
for technical assistance will be for individual specialists, and the balance will be for firms.  A&#13;
maximum of US$870,000 of the technical assistance will be directly contracted. Table 5 shows&#13;
procurement packages for technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.6    In compliance with Bank procedures, the standard consultant contract will be used for all&#13;
procurement. Applicable review procedures are discussed in various sections of the Guidelines for&#13;
Use of Consultants.   However, in the case of firms for technical assistance contracts under&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent, the Bank will require prior review of only the terms of reference and short&#13;
lists of potential consultants. In the case of individual consultants, the Bank will require prior review&#13;
only of TORs and short lists for contracts under US$50,000 equivalent. In addition, all sole source&#13;
contracting will be agreed in advance and pre-reviewed by the Bank. More generally, the Bank's&#13;
Country Procurement Assistance Review (CPAR) will be completed early next year after the&#13;
Procurement Law  has been passed by Parliament.   Progress of procurement activities will be&#13;
monitored by the Project Coordinator, and periodic reports on procurement progress, including&#13;
variations in schedule, will be sent to the Bank on a regular basis.&#13;

D. Disbursement and Financing Schedules&#13;
3.7    Disbursements. The loan is expected to be disbursed over a period of two years. The&#13;
project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1997, and the Closing Date of the loan will be&#13;
June 30, 1998. Retroactive financing of up to 10 percent of the loan or US$500,000 will be provided&#13;
to cover actual expenditures by the Government, primarily for the early appointment of advisors and&#13;
some studies, after October 1995. The disbursement plan is shown in Table 6.&#13;

3.8    Disbursements will be made as follows:&#13;
(a)   for technical assistance, 100 percent of expenditures, excluding taxes; and&#13;
(b)   repayment of PPF.&#13;
3.9    Disbursements against contracts for services exceeding US$100,000 equivalent will be made&#13;
against normal documentation. For contracts below that level, disbursements will be made on the&#13;
basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) with appropriate documentation retained by the Project&#13;
Coordinator and kept available for examination by Bank missions. Statements of Expenditures may&#13;
also be used for individual consultants for contracts below US$50,000. The minimum size of an&#13;
application for direct withdrawal from the loan account is 20 percent of the current amount of the&#13;
Authorized Allocation to the Special Account (see para. 3.10).&#13;
3.10   Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower will establish a&#13;
Special Account in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the&#13;
Bank's share of expenditures. The Authorized Allocation will be US$500,000, representing about&#13;
four months of average expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stage of&#13;
the project, the initial allocation to the Special Account will be limited to US$250,000. However&#13;
when the aggregate disbursements under the loan have reached the level of US$2 million, the initial&#13;
allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of US$500,000 by submitting the&#13;
relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every&#13;
three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other supporting documents.&#13;
This quarterly submission of replenishment applications takes precedence over the minimum&#13;
application size stated above in paragraph 3.9. Documentation requirements for replenishment will&#13;
follow the standard Bank procedure as described in the Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly&#13;
bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower will accompany&#13;
all replenishment requests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E. Audit Timetable&#13;
3.11   Project Audits. Project Accounts, the Special Account and Statements of Expenditure will be&#13;
audited in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank (March 1982). The Borrower will provide the Bank no later than by the&#13;
end of June of each year (i.e., within six months of the end of each fiscal year), an audit report of&#13;
such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against certified Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). The separate opinion should mention whether the SOEs submitted during the&#13;
fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be&#13;
relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications.&#13;
3.12   Reporting and Annual Reviews. To enable the Government and the Bank to monitor progress&#13;
of project implementation, the Project Coordinator will furnish to the Bank the following reports on a&#13;
regular basis: (a) semi-annual descriptive and financial report on each project component, objective&#13;
and activity (beginning from the date of loan effectiveness); (b) audited financial statements within six&#13;
months after the close of each fiscal year; and (c) records, financial statements, other progress reports&#13;
or other types of information that the Bank may request from time to time. The semi-annual reports&#13;
will describe in detail the current status of implementation, deviations, if any, from the&#13;
implementation plan, and the reasons for deviations and corrective actions being taken. The project&#13;
implementation plan and the implementation schedule will be the basis for supervision and reporting.&#13;
Based on information provided by the various beneficiary agencies, the Project Coordinator will&#13;
prepare the Government's contribution to the Implementation Completion Report within six months of&#13;
the Closing Date, covering all related activities during project implementation.&#13;
Chapter 4. DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES&#13;
A. Detailed Project Activities&#13;
4.1    Activities under each component are summarized below. The implementation schedule for&#13;
each component appears on pages 14-19.&#13;
4.2    Privatization of FSOEs.  The Government of Croatia is launching the second phase of its&#13;
privatization program which will include a Mass Privatization Program (MPP), the implementation of&#13;
which should begin in the second half of 1996. The Ministry of Privatization (MOP) is recruiting&#13;
consultants to advise it in the detailed elaboration of the second phase of the privatization program,&#13;
but also to assist in its smooth and rapid implementation. At this point, the following consultancies&#13;
are planned (base costs shown in parenthesis).&#13;
(a)   Mass Privatization Advisors (US$350,000). Advisors will be needed to assist the MOP in the&#13;
detailed elaboration ("engineering") of the MPP, with the utmost concern for smooth&#13;
implementation of the program  and sensitivity of the population.  Their task will be to&#13;
propose and evaluate various options for all aspects and steps of the program. This will,&#13;
among other things, include the selection of enterprises under the scheme, the assessment of&#13;
supply and demand for vouchers and shares, characteristics (tradability of vouchers, etc.),&#13;
logistics for registration and distribution of vouchers, mechanisms for conversion into shares,&#13;
public awareness campaign, establishment and regulatory framework for investment funds.&#13;
Terms of reference appear as Attachment 1.  World Bank Guidelines were followed to&#13;
procure the services of a consulting firm, and a contract which will qualify for the retroactive&#13;
financing arrangement under the loan has been awarded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(b)  Privatization Advisor (US$20,000). His main tasks will be (1) to provide pragmatic opinions&#13;
and recommendations on the feasibility of various privatization procedures and recommend&#13;
alternative measures to improve and accelerate the implementation of the program; (2) to&#13;
assist the MOP in coordinating the various departments of the Ministry and of the Croatian&#13;
Privatization Fund in the implementation of the privatization program; and (3) to help the&#13;
MOP prepare progress reports on privatization for the Government and the International&#13;
Financial Institutions assisting Croatia. Terms of reference appear as Attachment 2.&#13;
(c)   Miscellaneous Advisory Services (US$790,000, total). A variety of advisory services will be&#13;
needed to improve implementation of the existing privatization methods and the operations of&#13;
the CPF.  Consultant services will be required to assist the CPF in preparing and&#13;
implementing transactions of selected large and medium enterprises (US$300,000). This will&#13;
include evaluation of enterprises, preparation of prospectuses, elaborating plans for breaking&#13;
up large groups into smaller units which will be easier to privatize, assistance in negotiations&#13;
with investors, and proposing emergency restructuring measures for enterprises under the&#13;
control of the CPF while awaiting privatization. Legal advisory services from internationally&#13;
reputed firms (US$150,000) will be used on an ad hoc basis to assist the CPF in complex&#13;
negotiations of large transactions with strategic investors. Consultants will also be hired to&#13;
improve the CPF's internal procedures and upgrade its management information services&#13;
(US$200,000) as a follow-up to the first two phases of the reorganization of the CPF,&#13;
currently being implemented.  Privatization and restructuring experts (US$140,000) will&#13;
advise the Ministry of Economy on selected aspects of restructuring of a few complex&#13;
industrial enterprises undergoing or slated for privatization. Terms of reference for these&#13;
assignments will be prepared on a case-by-case basis depending on CPF's readiness.&#13;
4.3    Rehabilitation and Privatization of Public Enterprises:&#13;
(a)  Advisors - Financial Analyst and Audit Expert for the Office for the Restructuring and&#13;
Economics of State-owned Enterprises (ORESE) (US$500,000). World Bank Guidelines were&#13;
followed to procure the services of a consulting firm for the above tasks, and a contract which&#13;
will qualify for the retroactive financing arrangement under the loan has been awarded.&#13;
The Financial Analyst will assist ORESE to improve its performance of the following tasks:&#13;
(1) preparation of internal financial statements and other financial indicators for presentation&#13;
to the Government; and (2) carrying out financial analyses related to the performance of&#13;
major state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the industry and infrastructure sectors. Terms of&#13;
reference appear as Attachment 3.&#13;
A high level audit expert will assist ORESE in improving its internal auditing procedures. He&#13;
will also assist ORESE in carrying out systematic and ad hoc controls and audits of the&#13;
activities of SOEs in the industry and infrastructure sectors and train ORESE's auditors.&#13;
Terms of reference appear as Attachment 4.&#13;
(b)  Kutina Fertilizer Company, Strategic Planning and Restructuring Study (US$450,000). World&#13;
Bank Guidelines were followed to procure the services of a consulting firm for the above&#13;
tasks, and a contract which will qualify for the retroactive financing arrangement under the&#13;
loan has been awarded. The objectives of the study are to inform the Government and INA&#13;
on the current and prospective competitive position of INA-Kutina, to identify measures to&#13;
maintain and improve its competitive position, to analyze strategic options, to value the&#13;
Kutina plant on the basis of its present performance and its potential prospects, to formulate a&#13;
plan for the privatization of Kutina as a separate entity from INA and to make preliminary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
proposals on various options for its privatization. The study will also recommend a phased&#13;
program for the consolidation of the core operations of the enterprise and divestiture of non-&#13;
essential operations, and analyze the social and employment implications of consolidation and&#13;
divestiture. Terms of reference appear as Attachment 5. The study should be completed by&#13;
May 1996.&#13;
(c)  INA  Refineries Study (US$200,000).   The added value analysis of INA's complete&#13;
hydrocarbon chain has confirmed that one of the worst performing segments of the group's&#13;
integrated production chain is the refining, composed of three refineries with substantial&#13;
overcapacity and out-of-date technology. The loan will finance a more in-depth analysis to&#13;
determine which refinery could be kept in operation with minimum upgrading investments and&#13;
which should be closed or alternatively offered for sale to foreign companies.  The&#13;
Govemment has proposed to contract this study to the consultants who carried out the initial&#13;
added value analysis for the whole group. Draft Terms of Reference appear as Attachment 6.&#13;
The study should be completed by June 1996.&#13;
(d)  Complementary Studies in the Power Sector (US$300,000).  The European Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is financing a basic tariff study to design a least-&#13;
cost investment plan, as well as institutional and regulatory studies in the sector. Financing&#13;
from the TA loan is earmarked for complementary institutional, tariff and regulatory studies&#13;
to be identified in about six months' time on the basis of the results from the EBRD studies.&#13;
(e)   Tariff Study for HPT (US$100,000). Working with the staff of HPT, the Croatian post and&#13;
telecommunications agency, the consultants will review the new structure and levels of tariffs&#13;
proposed by HPT. Based on the experience of privatized telecommunications companies&#13;
intemationally, the consultants will propose a mechanism for the automatic adjustment of&#13;
tariffs. Terms of reference will be prepared after completion of the ongoing study.&#13;
(f)   Spectrum Management Study (US$50,000). In order to supervise the initial liberalization of&#13;
the telecommunications sector, as it opens to independent operating companies, and the&#13;
development of cellular services, the Government wishes to develop the capacity for spectrum&#13;
management. The program consists of about four weeks of training on the use of related&#13;
computer software.&#13;
4.4    Rehabilitation and Privatization of the Banking system:&#13;
(a)  Legal Advisor for the Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA) (US$100,000). The BRA will seek&#13;
the services of a law firm to assist it and its local counsel in designing the structure of the&#13;
purchase and assumption transactions to rehabilitate Privredna Banka Zagreb, the largest bank&#13;
in Croatia. Among other tasks, the law firm will prepare documentation for the conveyancing&#13;
of assets and liabilities located outside Croatia from the old Privredna Banka Zagreb to the&#13;
new. Terms of reference appear as Attachment 7.&#13;
(b)  Accounting and Miscellaneous Services for the Bank Rehabilitation Agency (US$50,000). The&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
alia, (1) assist the MOF and the BRA in developing legislation required for the successful&#13;
function of the program and for the development of a deposit insurance scheme; (2) assist in&#13;
developing the BRA's internal organization; (3) assist in developing the BRA's Asset&#13;
Management Department; (4) help to develop the Banking Department's capabilities in&#13;
supervising the activities of banks participating in the rehabilitation program; and (5) develop&#13;
and maintain the technical assistance program for the banking sector. Terms of reference&#13;
appear as Attachment 8.&#13;
(d) Financial Advisory Services (US$600,000). The BRA will seek a variety of financial advisory&#13;
services for (1) assistance in creating restructuring plans for BRA-managed enterprises; and&#13;
(2) provision of special audits and valuations required for offering memoranda and public&#13;
offering documents for the sale process of BRA-owned equity stakes in banks and enterprises.&#13;
Some funding will be provided for the retainer portion of fees to be paid to financial advisors&#13;
involved in the sale of BRA-owned equity stakes to international investors.  Terms of&#13;
reference appear as Attachment 9.&#13;
B. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.5    The detailed schedule of implementation by activity for each sub-component appears on&#13;
pages 14-19. The schedule takes into account the work to be carried out during project preparation&#13;
and reflects the detailed implementation activities. Based on the level of preparedness of the Croatian&#13;
Government, the quality of the work already completed and the need for timely completion of studies&#13;
for the implementation of reforms in the enterprise and banking sectors, it is planned that the&#13;
implementation will start prior to loan effectiveness.&#13;
Chapter 5. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
5.1    While the Project Coordinator (PC) will be responsible for financial control and for routine&#13;
implementation activities, including disbursement and reporting activities, the beneficiary agencies&#13;
will be responsible for the implementation of the activities within their respective components and will&#13;
report regularly to the PC and, through the PC, to the Assistant Minister of Finance. The PC will in&#13;
turn make progress reports to the Government and the Bank, noting especially any expected delays in&#13;
project implementation. The project liaison nominated by each beneficiary agency will be in charge&#13;
of that agency's respective project component and reporting on implementation to the PC on a&#13;
monthly basis.&#13;
5.2   Supervision of this project will be undertaken in tandem  with the preparation and&#13;
implementation of the Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL), the components of&#13;
the TA project being integral elements of, or preconditions for, the EFSAL. Continuing supervision,&#13;
including close supervision of the work of the consultants, will be provided through planned missions&#13;
in connection with the preparation and subsequent supervision of the EFSAL and on-going country&#13;
macroeconomic work.&#13;
5.3    Reporting by the Project Coordinator and Bank supervision will focus on in-depth reviews of&#13;
the consistency of activities for each component and sub-component with agreements reached at&#13;
negotiations, performance of the beneficiary agencies, assessment of emerging needs for adjustments&#13;
to project parameters, and possible follow-up activities which could be supported by the Bank. Bank&#13;
supervision will be based on the semi-annual progress reports and the annual evaluation of project&#13;
activities by the Project Coordinator. Progress will be measured against the project implementation&#13;
schedule. This will be supplemented by a review of project expenditures and availability of financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
resources, in addition to substantive discussions with technical assistance groups implementing and/or&#13;
assisting in the implementation of various components, and discussions with responsible authorities.&#13;
A mid-term review of the project will be carried out by February 28, 1997.&#13;

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
IN SUPPORT OF ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM&#13;
Ministry of Privatization&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Consultants for the Detailed Elaboration of the Mass Privatization Program&#13;
1.    With the completion of the first phase of the comprehensive program of privatization of its&#13;
Former Socially-Owned Enterprises (FSOEs), Croatia has already privatized a significant portion of&#13;
the initial population of about 2600 FSOEs. By mid 1995, some 1190 (mostly small and medium&#13;
enterprises - SMEs) had been fully privatized and another 940 majority privatized through various&#13;
methods, leaving about 500 FSOEs still totally or majority owned by the State (through the Croatian&#13;
Privatization Fund -CPF - and the Pension Funds). CPF's residual portfolio thereby consists of&#13;
equity stakes of about DM 6,400 million, ' mainly in these 400 medium and large enterprises, some&#13;
of which are in a difficult situation.&#13;
2.    For the second phase of the privatization program, which will encompass the residual CPF&#13;
portfolio and possibly parts of some of the 10 large Public Enterprises (PEs), the Government of&#13;
Croatia is planning to start implementing in mid-1996 a Mass Privatization Program (MPP). The new&#13;
privatization law currently under discussion in Parliament lays out the general principles of the MPP&#13;
as presently envisaged by the Government. The principles of this MPP will be finalized with the&#13;
enactment of this law, currently anticipated for February 1996. Various changes to the existing&#13;
privatization methods (which will generally be continued to be applied in parallel to the MPP) will&#13;
also be adopted.&#13;
3.    The Ministry of Privatization (MOP) is therefore recruiting consultants to assist it in the&#13;
detailed elaboration ("engineering") of the proposed MPP (Phase 1). While taking stock of the&#13;
experience available with the implementation of similar schemes in many other countries, the&#13;
consultants' work should also particularly take into account the specific economic, social and political&#13;
situation in Croatia. An overriding objective will be to ensure smooth implementation of the program&#13;
- with special concern for the sensitivity of the population, particularly the refugees and other victims&#13;
of the war. The MOP may decide, depending on the complexity of the detailed scheme finally&#13;
adopted and on the consultants' performance during Phase 1, to retain the consultants for specific&#13;
services during the implementation of the program (Phase 2).&#13;
4.    As currently envisaged in the draft law submitted to Parliament, the MPP would entitle some&#13;
300,000 people to receive free vouchers for an amount of DM 5,000 to 20,000 each, depending on&#13;
the category of eligible persons.  The total eligible population (initially displaced civilians, civil&#13;
victims of the war, families of missing soldiers) may be increased to 500,000 or more, as the&#13;
program is expanded to additional categories of citizens.  Other schemes for free distribution or&#13;
compulsory acquisition of vouchers may also be added. Each person would have the choice to freely&#13;
exchange its vouchers for shares of enterprises or turn them over to new private Privatization&#13;
Investment Funds (PIFs) who in turn will also exchange them for enterprise shares. Overall, there&#13;
would thus be a "nominal" mass of at least DM 2.5 to 3.5 billion in vouchers, which should be&#13;
I  This is a nominal value which may not reflect the economic or market value of the enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
matched by an at least "equivalent" mass of shares of enterprises. It is the current intention of the&#13;
MOP to propose a pool of shares of enterprises selected among the good ones in its present portfolio,&#13;
including many of the best. At a later stage, the MOP could envisage also to add blocks of shares of&#13;
selected PEs; however, this will be very much contingent on enactment of specific legislation&#13;
authorizing the privatization of such PEs, such as in Telecommunications.&#13;
5.     The currently envisaged timing for the implementation of the MPP would broadly be: (i)&#13;
distribution of the vouchers to the main target population by the third quarter of 1996 at the latest;&#13;
and (ii) completion of the exchange of their vouchers for enterprise shares/PIF shares by the end of&#13;
1996. The bulk of the consultants' work (Phase 1) is thus expected to take place over the period&#13;
February to June 1996.&#13;
6.     In assisting the MOP in elaborating the detailed process, the consultants will for every main&#13;
component/stage of the design propose and evaluate various alternatives - presenting the advantages&#13;
and disadvantages to the MOP in particular and the Government in general - to help them select the&#13;
optimum solutions for a cost efficient, smooth and rapid implementation.&#13;
Specific Tasks&#13;
7.     The consultants will assist the MOP in addressing a variety of issues and in performing&#13;
various other tasks, including mainly:&#13;
* mapping of CPF's portfolio of enterprises, evaluating and recommending their optimum&#13;
privatization track;&#13;
* assessing the supply of vouchers/demand for shares versus the supply of enterprise shares;&#13;
X characteristics of vouchers (non-tradability, expiration period, conversion procedures &amp;&#13;
rates, etc.)&#13;
*   need for limiting/delaying tradability of enterprise shares depending on market&#13;
evolution&#13;
*   logistics of registration and voucher distribution;&#13;
* evaluating/influencing the citizens' preference for direct conversion into enterprise shares&#13;
or for entrusting vouchers to PIFs;&#13;
* alternatives of exchanging vouchers for shares (bidding, number of rounds, price limits,&#13;
etc.) with particular concern to avoid a free fall of share prices;&#13;
* logistics of voucher exchange/bidding for shares&#13;
*   possible need for and form of Government initial support to PIFs&#13;
*   regulatory framework for PIFs and eligibility criteria of PIF managers&#13;
*   legal aspects&#13;
* phasing, detailed planning, critical path&#13;
*   choice of coordinating entity&#13;
*   review of adequacy of public awareness campaign proposed by MOP&#13;
*   cost estimates and financing plan; and&#13;
* possibility of expansion of the scheme (more vouchers, additional rounds, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
8.    The consultants will work directly under the Assistant Minister of Privatization in charge of&#13;
the MPP (who in turn refers to the Minister of Privatization).  They are expected to assist the&#13;
Minister and Assistant Minister from time to time in making presentations on the details of the MPP&#13;
to a higher Government Team under the Vice-Prime Minister in charge of Economic Affairs. The&#13;
consultants will also work in close collaboration with the other departments of the MOP, as well as&#13;
with the CPF. In addition to specific reports marking the successive milestones of the work, the&#13;
consultants will produce monthly progress reports to be submitted to the MOP, the Government Team&#13;
and the World Bank.&#13;

Terms of Reference&#13;
Privatization Advisor&#13;
1.    Croatia has now completed the first phase of the comprehensive program of privatization of&#13;
its Former Socially-Owned Enterprises (FSOEs). A significant portion of the initial population of&#13;
about 2600 FSOEs has now been privatized. By mid-1995, some 1190 (mostly small and medium&#13;
enterprises - SMEs) had been fully privatized and another 940 majority privatized through various&#13;
methods, leaving about 500 FSOEs still totally or majority owned by the State (through the Croatian&#13;
Privatization Fund - CPF - and the Pension Funds). Croatia is now launching the second phase of the&#13;
privatization program which will encompass the residual CPF portfolio and possibly parts of some of&#13;
the eight large Public Enterprises (PEs). This second phase would, among other things, include a new&#13;
Mass Privatization Program (MPP), the implementation of which should start in mid 1996. A new&#13;
Privatization law is currently under discussion in Parliament. The principles of the MPP would then&#13;
be finalized and various changes to the existing privatization methods, which will generally continue&#13;
to be applied in parallel to the MPP, will be adopted.&#13;
2.    The Ministry of Privatization (MOP) is recruiting various consultants, first to advise it in the&#13;
detailed elaboration of the second phase of the privatization program, but also assist in its smooth and&#13;
rapid implementation. One consultant will be a high level privatization advisor, whose main task will&#13;
be to provide pragmatic opinions and recommendations on the feasibility of the various privatization&#13;
procedures, to assist the MOP in coordinating the various departments of the MOP and of the CPF in&#13;
the implementation of the privatization program, and to help the MOP prepare progress reports on&#13;
privatization for the Government and the International Financial Institutions assisting Croatia.&#13;
3.    The consultant will mainly:&#13;
* Assist the MOP in the mapping of the CPF portfolio of enterprises, recommending the&#13;
optimum privatization method for the various enterprises/categories of enterprises.&#13;
* Advise the Minister of Privatization and his Assistant Ministers by continuously assessing&#13;
the progress of the various privatization methods and evaluating the work of the CPF, and&#13;

INA Petrokemija Kutina Fertilizer Company&#13;
Strategic Planning and Restructuring Study&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Government of Croatia (GOC) is pursuing an ambitious program of restructuring and&#13;
privatization. A key component of this program is the privatization of major state-owned enterprises,&#13;
the largest of which is Industrija Nafte (INA). INA is an integrated oil and gas group with a number&#13;
of allied operations including the fertilizer production and sales operations of the INA Petrokemija&#13;
Kutina Company. The GOC intends to restructure the INA Group to a core group of activities with&#13;
non-core activities unbundled so that they can be privatized/divested separately. One of these non-&#13;
core activities is the fertilizer operations of Kutina.&#13;
Fertilizer Sector Background&#13;
2.    Kutina is the sole fertilizer producer in Croatia and operates world scale nitrogen and&#13;
phosphate fertilizer facilities at the one site in the town of Kutina. It also produces carbon black.&#13;
Due to the limited size of the Croatian market, export markets are of major importance to Kutina, and&#13;
maintaining and improving its competitive position in these markets is of prime importance.&#13;
Privatization of INA is expected to provide access to the capital required for the medium and long-&#13;
term development of Kutina; ensure and enhance access to major export markets, and to raw&#13;
materials and intermediates.&#13;
3.    Details of the major facilities of Kutina are:&#13;
Product      Capacity                          Design and Start-up Date&#13;
Ammonia      450,000 tpy                Kellogg 1360 tpd plant SU 1984&#13;
Urea         495,000 tpy                Stamicarbon 1500 tpd, SU 1984&#13;
CAN          330,000 tpy (as AN)        Two plants, 1000 tpd&#13;
Nitric Acid   416,000 tpy (as 100 percent)  Three plants, 1260 tpd&#13;
Phos. Acid    150,000 tpy (as P205)      Fison 500 tpd, Sulfuric Acid 1500 tpd&#13;

Objectives&#13;
4.    The objectives of the study are:&#13;
a) To inform the GOC and INA on the current and prospective competitive position of INA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
b) To identify short, medium, and longer-term measures that would maintain and improve&#13;
INA Petrokemija Kutina's competitive position.&#13;
c) To analyze strategic options and propose a strategy for Kutina.&#13;
d) To value the business on the basis of its present performance and potential short and&#13;
medium-term prospects.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
5.     The study is to cover all aspects of the fertilizer sector including raw  material supply,&#13;
domestic and foreign markets and marketing. At the sector level:&#13;
a) meet with the Ministry of Agriculture and other ministries and institutions concerned with&#13;
the development of the fertilizer sector and ascertain their plans and policies for the sector;&#13;
b) based on an analysis of the development prospects and directions for the sector, and the&#13;
organization of the sector in other market economies, review options with the concerned&#13;
institutions and recommend a development plan that would address major issues and have&#13;
broad support;&#13;
c) address specifically in the development plan the promotion of efficient distribution systems&#13;
and fertilizer credit;&#13;
d) address specifically in the development plan the future role of farm-gate fertilizer&#13;
subsidies, and how these can be reduced;&#13;
e) review past fertilizer consumption in Croatia and make medium-term demand projections.&#13;
6.     At Kutina, the scope of work is to:&#13;
f) Carry out a diagnosis of Kutina's operations. This would include:&#13;
i)  present and projected access and cost of raw materials and utilities;&#13;
ii)  location of production and transportation costs and problems for raw material supplies&#13;
and delivery of products to domestic and international markets;&#13;
iii) details of production facilities available including age, technology, product grades and&#13;
quality, achievable capacity utilization, and major environmental and safety problems&#13;
that are an implicit feature of the technology used;&#13;
iv) major product markets and their past and projected future development, including&#13;
distribution channels;&#13;
v)  identification of the core operations of the enterprise that are essential for its future&#13;
development and those activities that should be divested;&#13;
vi) examine the major cost elements of the enterprise's core operations and the costs of&#13;
the other operations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
vii) review the organizational structure of the enterprise and its human resource&#13;
development programs; and&#13;
viii) review the restructuring and development plans of the enterprise.&#13;
g) On the basis of the above diagnosis:&#13;
i)  analyze the present and projected competitiveness of the major operations of the&#13;
enterprise in export and domestic markets and identify those operations that are&#13;
clearly not competitive, cannot be economically restructured, and should be closed&#13;
down;&#13;
ii) identify those operations that are sustainable in the short and medium term and those&#13;
operations that need to be restructured to ensure sustainability. Recommend physical&#13;
restructuring plans ' and priorities and justify these with preliminary cost/benefit&#13;
calculations to show the impact of the proposed restructuring plans on the enterprise&#13;
up to the year 2005;&#13;
h) Identify major environmental clean-up liabilities that may have an effect on the value of&#13;
INA Petrokemija Kutina. This should include the future costs of closure of the existing&#13;
gypsum stack.&#13;
i) Analyze the organizational requirements of the enterprise for it to function efficiently in a&#13;
market economy and make specific recommendations for organizational changes and the&#13;
development of human resources; and&#13;
j) Recommnend how the enterprise should organize, operate and finance its marketing and&#13;
distribution system. Based on practices in other countries and the cost structure of the&#13;
enterprise, review pricing discount policies for sales to efficiently minimize inventories;&#13;
7.     At the INA level:&#13;
k) Identify those interfaces between INA Petrokemija Kutina and the INA parent company&#13;
and its subsidiaries (management, personnel, marketing, finance, material supply, etc.).&#13;
Organization of the Studies&#13;
8.     The consultants selected will be expected to have in house, or through linkages with other&#13;
consultants, the necessary data on historical and projected regional and international fertilizer market&#13;
developments, authoritative methodologies for international fertilizer price projections, and data for&#13;
comparing the international competitive situation of Kutina.&#13;
Restructuring plans should include the costs of bringing individual production units into compliance&#13;
with existing environmental standards, or good industry practice, where adequate standards do not yet&#13;
exist (this would include drill tower dust abatement, NOx abatement from nitric acid plants and&#13;
combustion of synthesis loop purge gas, hydrolysis of urea plant process water discharge, S02&#13;
emissions from associated sulfuric acid plants, gypsum disposal from phosphoric acid, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
9.     A counter-part team from the INA parent company and INA Petrokemija Kutina will be&#13;
formed to work with the consultants. The consultants are expected to work closely with the staff of&#13;
INA and provide frequent briefings to the management to ensure that the considerable expertise of&#13;
Kutina is utilized and that the views of management on the course of the study are taken into account&#13;
at an early stage.&#13;
10.   The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the ORESE will supervise the studies and will&#13;
constitute a steering committee made up of representatives from other concerned ministries and&#13;
institutions to which the consultants will give periodic status reports, and receive advice on aspects of&#13;
the study.&#13;
Organization of the Work Team&#13;
11.   Apart from the necessary business management, economic and financial backing, the work&#13;
team should include technical specialists in fertilizer production, specialists in fertilizer distribution&#13;
and marketing including the financial aspects of operating distribution systems and assessing domestic&#13;
demand in similar agricultural conditions to Croatia.&#13;

INA Refineries Study&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Government of Croatia (GOC) is pursuing an ambitious program of restructuring and&#13;
privatization. A key component of this program is the privatization/restructuring of INA to a core&#13;
group of activities.  Central to the formulation of this program  is the position of the oil based&#13;
operations of INA.&#13;
Refinery Sector Background&#13;
2.    INA owns and operates all the refinery capacity in Croatia which consists of the two major&#13;
fuels refineries of Sisak (6.4 million tpy) and Rijeka/Urinj (7 million tpy), and the two small specialty&#13;
refineries of Zagreb and Rijeka/Mlaka2 producing mainly lube oils and asphalt. Sisak processes all&#13;
domestic crude produced in Croatia and receives imported crude via the JANAF pipeline.3 Rijeka can&#13;
receive crude at its own port facilities or receive crude via a spur off the JANAF pipeline. There are&#13;
no product pipelines linking Sisak and the Zagreb region with the coast, all product transport is by&#13;
road or rail.&#13;
3.     Prior to the break-up of the Federation, the two fuels refineries were running at low capacity&#13;
utilization (approximately 52 percent for Sisak and 50 percent for Rijeka). After the break-up, and&#13;
with the consequential loss of markets, capacity utilization has fallen to lower levels; Sisak 26 percent&#13;
and Rijeka 47 percent - about one third capacity used at Rijeka has been for third party crude&#13;
processing.&#13;
4.     Historically INA had a dominant marketing position (about 70 percent and higher market&#13;
share) for refined products in Croatia, Slovenia, and Montenegro and a minor position (less than 20&#13;
percent) in the other republics; exports outside of the then Federation were minor, amounting to about&#13;
10 percent of production. INA retains a dominant position in the Croatian market but this is unlikely&#13;
to remain unchallenged as barriers to competition are removed to harmonize Croatian regulations with&#13;
those of the EU.&#13;
5.     Consultants have recently completed a detailed analysis of the financial structure and position&#13;
of INA, including the refinery operations. The analysis showed that for the period studied (1994) all&#13;
2      The information we have on file (four years old) is that detailed studies have been carried out for the&#13;
closure of Mlaka, due to its pollution impact on Rijeka City, and the construction of equivalent&#13;
processing units at Urinj.&#13;
3      The ocean terminal for the pipeline is on Krk Island at Omisalj, the terminal can receive tankers up to&#13;
350,000 DTW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
refineries had negative operating incomes which, with the addition of capital charges, leads to severe&#13;
rates of value destruction.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
6.    The objectives of the study are:&#13;
(a)    To inform GOC and INA on the current and prospective competitive position of the&#13;
refinery operations of INA in domestic and export markets.&#13;
(b)    To identify measures that in the short term would minimize losses, and in the medium&#13;
and longer-term would generate adequate returns on the capital base, and support and&#13;
strengthen the INA Group.&#13;
(c)    To analyze strategic refinery options and propose a strategy for INA.&#13;
(d)    To value discrete refinery units on the basis of present performance, and potential&#13;
short and medium-term prospects.&#13;
7.     The formulation of a plan to implement the selected strategic plan would be carried out in a&#13;
second phase study.&#13;
8.     From its present position as the sole shareholder of INA and the prospect in the medium-term&#13;
of remaining a major shareholder, the GOC is concerned to maximize the value of the INA Group&#13;
both as regards profits and share value. However, the GOC also has an overriding concern for the&#13;
development, in the medium term, of competitive markets in Croatia, including the markets for oil&#13;
products. Measures proposed in the study must reflect these concerns.&#13;
9.    In the short term, major elements of the strategic plan are expected to include measures to&#13;
rationalize refinery capacity through closures. In the medium to longer term, investments to improve&#13;
facilities and infrastructure may be justified. However, any elements of the strategic plan involving&#13;
capital investment must take into account the capability of INA to raise such funds and potential&#13;
sources, and to show that this will not lead to unacceptable debt levels.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
10.   The primary focus of the study are the refinery operations of INA. However, these operations&#13;
are dependant on other INA operations; to a considerable extent on local marketing and distribution,&#13;
and to a lesser extent on local crude production. The study needs to take account of these&#13;
dependencies and include an analysis of the interfaces of such operations.&#13;
11.    Realistic short, medium, and long-term estimates of domestic demand for refined products&#13;
should be made. It is important that these estimates be used to determine the size and configuration of&#13;
the refinery facilities that Croatia can support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
12.    The medium and long term share of the domestic market that INA can expect to retain should&#13;
be estimated. 4 This estimate should build on demand growth in distinct geographical market areas in&#13;
Croatia (e.g., coastal and interior) that are more or less vulnerable to competition from imports.&#13;
Account should also be taken of the measures and timetable for alignment of the competitive regime&#13;
in Croatia with that of the EU.&#13;
13.    Important medium and long-term competitive outside threats to INA's competitive position in&#13;
domestic markets should be identified, along with feasible counter measures. Such threats may&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)    Brand name marketing power of the 'majors', particularly in lubricants;&#13;
(b)    Control and expansion of specific infrastructure, such as port receiving facilities and&#13;
pipelines.5&#13;
(c)    Control of either the Rijeka or Sisak Refinery, and/or their receiving facilities by a&#13;
competitor.&#13;
14.     The consultants should assess the impact in the short, medium, and long term  of various&#13;
measures to bring INA's refinery capacity to a level that can efficiently support a realistic share of&#13;
domestic demand. Such measures should include:&#13;
(a)    A phased close-down of crude oil refinery operations with the retention of storage and&#13;
terminal facilities, etc., needed to support imported product distribution, and local&#13;
crude oil export.&#13;
(b)    Retention of both fuels refineries with necessary rationalization.&#13;
(c)    Closure of one of the fuels refineries with retention of necessary storage and terminal&#13;
facilities, etc., for internal distribution.&#13;
(d)    Closure/sale of Zagreb and Rijeka/Mlaka.&#13;
Organization of the Studies&#13;
15.    A counter-part team from INA will be formed to work with the consultants. The consultants&#13;
are expected to work closely with the staff of INA and provide frequent briefings to the management&#13;
to ensure that the considerable expertise of INA 6 is utilized and that the views of management on the&#13;
course of the study are taken into account at an early stage.&#13;
16.    ORESE  will supervise the studies and will constitute a steering committee made up of&#13;
representatives from other concerned ministries and institutions to which the consultants will give&#13;
periodic status reports, and receive advice on aspects of the study. As UBS will need the results of&#13;
the study in order to carry out its responsibilites, UBS should have a representative on the steering&#13;
4      This process is likely to be an iterative one as the comparative advantage that INA may have in these&#13;
markets will depend on the specific measures that are to be adopted.&#13;
5      It may be feasible to expand the receiving facilities at Omisalj to include products and to construct a&#13;
product pipeline over the existing right of way for the JANAF pipeline.&#13;
6      The consultants should carry out an early review with INA to determine to what extent, if&#13;
any, the refinery computer optimization models can be used to generate necessary analytical&#13;
data.&#13;

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
IN SUPPORT OF ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM&#13;
Bank Rehabilitation Agency&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Financial Services (Assets sales and management)&#13;
Summary&#13;
1.    The financial advisor will provide a combination of training and services to the Bank&#13;
Rehabilitation Agency ('BRA') in the context of preparing the sale of shares owned by the BRA in&#13;
one or several banks or enterprises, and assisting BRA in managing selected assets.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    The Croatian Bank and Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization program relies heavily on&#13;
the newly-established Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA) to carry out or supervise both enterprise and&#13;
bank restructuring. Under the restructuring model adopted by the Croatian authorities, the BRA is to&#13;
become part or full-owner of five problem banks ('the banks') accounting for about 50 percent of the&#13;
banking system's assets, and to seek their subsequent privatization. To rehabilitate the banks, as well&#13;
as facilitate their privatization, it is also envisioned that the BRA will conduct, or supervise, the&#13;
management of at least some of their troubled assets.&#13;
3.    The BRA  itself was established by the Law on Savings Deposits Insurance and Bank&#13;
Rehabilitation, adopted by the Croatian Parliament in 1994. It is supervised by a Board chaired by&#13;
the Prime Minister and comprised of key Croatian officials. The BRA managing Director was&#13;
appointed in July 1995 and is in the process of finalizing the staffing of BRA and arranging training.&#13;
4.    In July 1995, the BRA carried out the rehabilitation of Slavonska Banka (SB), as a result of&#13;
which it became the owner of [35] percent of SB's shares. The decision to rehabilitate Rijecka Banka&#13;
and Istarska Banka, made in February 1996, is expected to result in the BRA's becoming the sole&#13;
owner of these two banks. In the near term, similar decisions and outcomes are expected to take&#13;
place with two other Croatian banks in need of rehabilitation, Privredna Banka Zagreb and Istarska&#13;
Banka.&#13;
5.    In addition to becoming the part or full-owner of selected banks, the BRA is expected to play&#13;
a major role in managing some of these banks' troubled assets. The BRA's asset management&#13;
activities will be carried out using several methods:&#13;
-   first, for major assets, the BRA will execute a carve-out from the banks' balance sheets,&#13;
and will carry out the management of assets directly, in close coordination with the&#13;
relevant Government Agencies, such as the Ministry of Economy, or the Office for&#13;
Restructuring of State Enterprises; asset management may entail, in selected cases,&#13;
conversion of loans into shares, and the subsequent search for prospective owners of the&#13;
enterprises involved;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
second, a number of assets will also be carved out from the banks' balance sheets, but&#13;
BRA intends to contract their management out to Croatian firms;&#13;
third, smaller assets will remain under the management of the banks, and will be&#13;
managed by the banks according to policies and procedures which we have agreed with&#13;
the World Bank will be applied for this purpose.&#13;
I. SALE OF BRA'S SHARES&#13;
6.     The sale of BRA's shares in banks or enterprises is authorized by the Law on Savings&#13;
Deposits Insurance and Bank Rehabilitation, as amended in [April 1996]. Although a variety of&#13;
privatization methods may be considered by the BRA, it is expected that offerings to multilateral and&#13;
foreign institutional investors, or to Croatian investors, will be the preferred method.&#13;
Tasks&#13;
7.     The tasks to be performed by the financial advisor will be as follows:&#13;
(a)    Performance of Due Diligence. The financial advisor will perform full due diligence&#13;
on the balance sheet and income statement of the banks or enterprises for sale, to the&#13;
extent required to prepare a prospectus and other offering documents to international&#13;
standards and in compliance with Croatian securities laws. Full access to the books,&#13;
records, management, and external auditors of the entities for sale, and to the&#13;
management and staff of the BRA, will be provided for this purpose. As far as banks&#13;
are concerned, it is hoped that the external auditors will be completing their audit of&#13;
1995 financial statements at about the same time as the financial advisor commences&#13;
work, and the financial advisor will be required, to the extent possible, to coordinate&#13;
with the auditors with the objective of minimizing the duplication of requests for&#13;
information.&#13;
(b)    Valuation. Using the results of its due diligence and research regarding local and&#13;
international securities markets, the financial advisor will provide the BRA with a&#13;
range of estimated valuations for the shares under different sales structures.&#13;
(c)    Preparation of Documentation for a Domestic Public Offering. The financial advisor&#13;
will work in close cooperation with BRA to prepare all required documentation,&#13;
including a prospectus, for a Croatian domestic public offering.&#13;
(d)    Preparation of an International Offering Memorandum.  In the event that it is&#13;
required, the financial advisor will prepare all necessary documentation for the&#13;
placement of a portion of the BRA's holdings with multilateral and other foreign&#13;
institutional investors.&#13;
(e)    Training Component. The financial advisor will be expected to provide on the job&#13;
(and other formal, if appropriate) training to BRA staff. The form of training should&#13;
include fully integrating staff nominated by the BRA into the financial advisor's team&#13;
assigned to this project to ensure that the staff receive exposure to all aspects of the&#13;
advisor's work under these terms of reference. Significant weight will be given in the&#13;
evaluation of proposals from prospective financial advisors to their willingness to&#13;
commit time, personnel, and other resources to this task.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Confidentiality Agreement&#13;
8.    The financial advisor will be required to enter into a confidentiality agreement with both the&#13;
BRA and any of the entities to be privatized. Proposals regarding this assignment should include a&#13;
copy of the financial advisor's standard confidentiality agreement.&#13;
Sub-Contractors&#13;
9.    Performance of the due diligence work will require the contractor to be able to value bank&#13;
assets in Croatia and to work with a large number of Croatian language documents, in addition to&#13;
documents in other European languages. At the tender briefing to be held on [    ], the BRA will&#13;
supply prospective financial advisors with a list of approved Croatian subcontractors which are&#13;
qualified to assist the financial advisor in the performance of his tasks. Tenders should include details&#13;
of the Croatian sub-contractor selected by the financial advisor.&#13;
II. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES&#13;
Types of Assistance Required&#13;
10.   In order to support the methods of asset management described above, the agency is&#13;
requesting that technical assistance support to this function be provided in the most flexible manner&#13;
possible.&#13;
11.   The BRA requires assistance for two distinct technical assistance projects:&#13;
-   first, the provision of general training in the area of asset management. This training&#13;
would be requested for all groups working on BRA assets. The BRA intends to adopt&#13;
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) based policies and procedures and&#13;
accordingly would need the assistance of experts in this area for a period of about three&#13;
months;&#13;
-   second, over a one year period, assistance would be for very specific purposes related to&#13;
the restructuring of particular assets. In these cases the contractor or its subcontractors&#13;
would be required to provide expertise with respect to a specific type of company and&#13;
would need industry-specific expertise.&#13;
In order to manage this process, the contractor/contractor consortium should have a local&#13;
representative available to work with the BRA on an as-needed basis to refine the BRA's requests for&#13;
specific assistance.&#13;
Training Component - Tasks&#13;
12.   Financial restructuring skills are available in Croatia and the BRA would not anticipate&#13;
needing general training in this area. The Training component would be focused on training BRA&#13;
staff and contractors in FDIC case-based management policies and procedures, including, training in&#13;
case preparation, file maintenance, and committee/board presentation and decision making processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Training Component - Qualifications&#13;
13.   A contractor capable of delivering FDIC-trained personnel for this purpose would be most&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
Asset Specific Component - Project Management&#13;
14.   The management arrangement for the provision of the Asset Specific component of technical&#13;
assistance will be crucial to the success of the project. We propose that the BRA be the apex&#13;
institution for this purpose. In this role, the BRA would request the contractor to provide, within the&#13;
scope of the terms of reference, short-term assistance to a specific enterprise under the control of the&#13;
agency. The assistance request would specify the exact types of experts required.&#13;
Asset Specific Component - Tasks&#13;
15.   In order to service the anticipated technical assistance needs under this component, we would&#13;
propose that the contractor have available for short-term assignments the following experts able to&#13;
perform the specified functions:&#13;
-  Financial Assistance (5 experts)&#13;
(a) Establish and/or improve financial reporting systems&#13;
(b) Install tight but simple working capital and cash flow management and reporting&#13;
systems&#13;
(c) Assess management accounting needs&#13;
(d) Conduct detailed product profitability analysis and establish cost accounting systems&#13;
(e) Conduct detailed cost review to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for expense&#13;
reduction.&#13;
-  Marketing Assistance (5 experts)&#13;
(a) Establish and/or expand the sales and marketing function&#13;
(b) Assist in preparation of marketing strategy and plans&#13;
(c) Seek export opportunities using network of existing contacts&#13;
(d) Review and make recommendations regarding sales networks&#13;
(e) Conduct detailed competitive analysis in both foreign and domestic markets&#13;
(f) Review and make recommendations regarding product pricing strategies&#13;
(g) Review and make recommendations regarding product development needs&#13;
-  Production (6 experts)&#13;
(a) Analysis of standard manufacturing times on the shop floor&#13;
(b) Review and make recommendations for actions to improve productivity&#13;
(c) Review quality standards and make reconmmendations to bring products into line with&#13;
export standards (EU and other)&#13;
(d) Review and make recommendations regarding cost reductions and opportunities for&#13;
efficiency gains through the use of subcontractors.&#13;
(e) Review and make recommendations for production process design and shop floor&#13;
layout.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
IT/MIS assistance (5 experts)&#13;
(a) Assess requirements and make recommendations for the purchase of hardware and&#13;
software to provide financial systems support&#13;
(b) Design IT support required for budget and cost accounting functions&#13;
(c) Review and make recommendations regarding MIS needs&#13;
Organization &amp; Human resources&#13;
(a) Provide senior and middle management with functional training courses&#13;
(b) Provide shop floor training to improve quality, with focus on meeting appropriate ISO&#13;
standard.&#13;
Asset Specific Component - Qualifications &amp; Tasks&#13;
16.   The asset specific component calls for a firm (more likely a consortium of firms) capable of&#13;
providing industry specific expertise. The focus of this expertise should be on the issues faced by&#13;
large industrial concerns and would include areas such as process engineering, labor rationalization&#13;
and retraining, marketing, financial systems, information technology and management information&#13;
systems.  The process engineering and marketing sub-components would require experts with&#13;
extensive industry specific experience, and the marketing component would specifically require&#13;
expertise in the Western European markets which are serviced by the enterprises which will be in the&#13;
BRA asset portfolio.&#13;
a) Team Leader&#13;
The resident team leader would be in charge of coordinating all assignments under the&#13;
Asset Specific component of the technical assistance. The team leader would have both an&#13;
administrative and an operational role by assuming the responsibility for the timely&#13;
implementation of all sub-projects and for providing for quality assurance for the work being&#13;
performed. The team leader would:&#13;
- assist the Director, Asset Management Department, of the BRA in identifying technical&#13;
assistance needs in the enterprises being restructured by the agency and its contractors;&#13;
- develop and agree with the BRA and the recipient enterprise terms of reference and cost&#13;
estimates for each technical assistance task;&#13;
- identify the appropriate experts to be used for each task;&#13;
-  monitor and evaluate each technical assistance assignment and propose follow-up actions,&#13;
if required; and&#13;
- ensure coordination between technical assistance tasks and ensure that opportunities for&#13;
efficiencies are utilized.&#13;
The team leader should demonstrate exceptional communications skills at the senior&#13;
management level and have significant experience in a management role in a consulting firm,&#13;
preferably with a specialization in industrial management consulting. The ability to speak&#13;
Croatian and/or German in addition to English would be an advantage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
b) Short-Term Experts&#13;
Short-term experts should have proven experience (not less than 10 years, at least the last&#13;
five of which should be in the identified specialty) as consultants or in industry in one of the&#13;
five areas described under the Asset Specific component.  Short-term  experts should be&#13;
available for assignments not to exceed four weeks on three weeks' notice from the team&#13;
leader.&#13;
III. COMMON PROVISIONS&#13;
Amount&#13;
17.    The amount available for this project is US$600,000, equivalent, excluding the fees for the&#13;
legal advisor which will be covered under another contract.&#13;

18.    The financial advisor will submit monthly reports regarding the progress of its work, and a&#13;
final report, to the BRA.&#13;
Conflicts of Interest&#13;
19.    Proposals should include information regarding potential or actual conflicts of interest between&#13;
