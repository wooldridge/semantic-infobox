INTRODUCTION BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
On April 26, 2005, ICSID celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the&#13;
ICSID Convention.As a multilateral legal framework for international investment dis-&#13;
pute settlement, the ICSID Convention has come to have a profound influence on&#13;
the development of international investment law and has contributed to improve the&#13;
investment climate in developing countries, a topic which remains at the forefront&#13;
of the development agenda. ICSID registered twenty-five new cases during the fiscal&#13;
year, bringing to 184 the total number of cases registered by the Centre since its incep-&#13;
tion.With these new registrations, ICSID administered a record 103 cases during a&#13;
single year. Membership of the Centre rose to 142 States following the ratification of&#13;
the ICSID Convention by Cambodia andYemen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The fortieth anniversary of the Convention is an appropriate time to step back and&#13;
reflect on ICSID's track-record and plan for the future. Moreover, this anniversary&#13;
coincides with a shift in leadership following the decision of Antonio R. Parra, Deputy&#13;
Secretary-General, to retire from ICSID after almost two decades of remarkably able&#13;
and loyal service to the Centre. ICSID has thus begun a process of strategic planning&#13;
for the years ahead. Central to these efforts is a constructive dialogue with stakeholders&#13;
regarding their perception of the strengths and weaknesses of the ICSID process and&#13;
their recommendations for the future development of the institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Successful dispute resolution depends on a sound and effective framework of proce-&#13;
dural rules.The ICSID Secretariat has, in the past year, been working on a number&#13;
of amendments to the ICSID Rules and Regulations.The key proposed amendments&#13;
concern some preliminary procedures in regard to provisional measures and expe-&#13;
dited review of requests for dismissal of unmeritorious claims; access of third parties&#13;
to proceedings; publication of awards; and disclosure requirements for arbitrators. In&#13;
October 2004, the Secretariat released a Discussion Paper on Possible Improvements&#13;
of the Framework for ICSID Arbitration, which was distributed to the member States&#13;
and also made available to the public for comments.This was followed in May 2005&#13;
by a Working Paper on suggested changes to the ICSID Rules and Regulations. It is&#13;
expected that in the next fiscal year, these amendments will be submitted for approval&#13;
to the ICSID Administrative Council.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ICSID also continued its work on several recent initiatives for improving its services&#13;
and addressing current challenges.These include the promotion of conciliation as an&#13;
alternative to arbitration in suitable cases. Each time an ICSID arbitration proceeding&#13;
is commenced, the Secretariat reminds the parties of the conciliation option. ICSID is&#13;
also examining the possibility of establishing a mediation service for investment dis-&#13;
putes in collaboration with other World Bank Group organizations and to enhance&#13;
its training programs in the field of investor-State dispute settlement. Continuing our&#13;
publication activities, we are working on putting online our many publications relat-&#13;
ing to international investment law and arbitration, making these important sources of&#13;
information more widely available.The Secretariat focused during the year on iden-&#13;
tifying well-qualified candidates among women and developing country nationals for&#13;
nomination as arbitrators in ICSID cases in an effort to expand and diversify the pool&#13;
of arbitrators.We have also taken steps to strengthen ICSID's financial standing through&#13;
the revision of our Schedule of Fees.Another highlight of the past fiscal year was the&#13;
Secretariat's move to new facilities and the addition of new staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In closing, I would like to recognize once again the outstanding service to ICSID of&#13;
Antonio R. Parra, marked by his professionalism, collegiality, and high personal stan-&#13;
dards.While we regret his departure, we wish Mr. Parra all the very best in his new&#13;
endeavors at the University College London Faculty of Laws. He leaves the Centre a&#13;
stronger place by his significant contributions to the remarkable growth and relevance&#13;
of the institution.The ICSID Secretariat will keep on building on this legacy in a con-&#13;
stantly changing environment.&#13;

NEW MEMBERS&#13;
In the course of the year, Yemen and Cambodia became ICSID Contracting States by depos-&#13;
iting instruments of ratification of the ICSID Convention.In addition,the Convention was&#13;
signed by Syria. With the latest signature and two ratifications,there were 155 signatories and&#13;
142 Contracting States of the ICSID Convention at the end of FY 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A complete list of Contracting States and other signatories of the ICSID Convention is&#13;
provided in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DISPUTES BEFORE THE CENTRE&#13;
During the fiscal year, the Centre registered 25 new cases.A record number of 103&#13;
cases were either simultaneously pending or concluded in the course of the year.&#13;
By the end of FY 2005, the total number of cases registered with the Centre since&#13;
its inception reached 184. Of the new cases registered, 24 were arbitration proceed-&#13;
ings and one a conciliation proceeding. Five of the new cases were brought under the&#13;
ICSID Additional Facility Rules, and the rest were ICSID Convention conciliation and&#13;
arbitration proceedings.The jurisdiction of ICSID is being asserted under the North&#13;
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in one of the new arbitration cases.All of&#13;
the remaining 23 new arbitration proceedings were initiated on the basis of ICSID&#13;
arbitration provisions contained in bilateral investment treaties. In addition to the new&#13;
cases, the Centre instituted proceedings pursuant to five applications for annulment of&#13;
awards, and an application for interpretation of an award.Two of the applications for&#13;
annulment challenge awards rendered in FY 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fifteen ICSID proceedings were concluded in the period.These include the discontinu-&#13;
ance of an ICSID conciliation proceeding brought in the previous fiscal year. Five ICSID&#13;
arbitration proceedings were also discontinued at the request of one or both of the par-&#13;
ties concerned following an amicable settlement of the disputes. Awards were rendered in&#13;
seven arbitration proceedings. One of the awards embodied the parties' settlement agree-&#13;
ment.Two other awards upheld the claims in whole or in part. Jurisdiction was declined&#13;
in the remaining four of the awards. Final decisions were also issued in two proceedings&#13;
in which parties sought post-award remedies.These include a proceeding for the annul-&#13;
ment of an award and a proceeding for a supplementary decision in a NAFTA case con-&#13;
ducted under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The statistical figures relating to the geographical distribution of the ICSID caseload by&#13;
respondent States show that the majority of the cases pending before the Centre during&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 0 5                                                               5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the fiscal year, as before, involvedWestern Hemisphere countries.The remaining cases&#13;
were again almost evenly divided among countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia,&#13;
the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South and East Asia. One&#13;
third of the current cases relate to projects in the energy sector and the rest involve dis-&#13;
putes regarding investments in virtually all other economic sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In total, 58 different hearings and sessions were held in the cases pending before the&#13;
Centre during the fiscal year.Twenty-nine ICSID arbitral tribunals and five ad hoc&#13;
committees were constituted or reconstituted in the pending cases. In addition, a&#13;
ConsolidationTribunal was established pursuant to NAFTA Article 1126, following a&#13;
request by a respondent State seeking an order for consolidation of two proceedings&#13;
initiated under the Investment Chapter of NAFTA. Sixty-seven individuals from 27&#13;
different countries were appointed to serve as ICSID arbitrators or ad hoc committee&#13;
members.The parties or party-selected arbitrators nominated 67 percent of the total of&#13;
99 appointments made in the cases pending during the year.The remaining 33 percent&#13;
of the total appointments were made by ICSID.About 25 percent of all appointees were&#13;
nationals of developing countries.Women were appointed on four out of the five ad hoc&#13;
committees constituted by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council during&#13;
the year.The proceedings before the ICSID tribunals and ad hoc committees during the&#13;
year were conducted in one of the three official languages of ICSID, English, French and&#13;
Spanish, in 39 of the cases.Two of these three languages were used in different combina-&#13;
tions as procedural languages in the rest of the proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to administering the arbitration and conciliation cases under the ICSID&#13;
Convention and the Additional Facility Rules, ICSID provided, at the request of the&#13;
parties and the tribunals involved, administrative support for 10 arbitration proceed-&#13;
ings conducted under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on&#13;
InternationalTrade Law (UNCITRAL).The services furnished by the Centre for these&#13;
proceedings have ranged from limited assistance with the organization of hearings and&#13;
fund-holding to full secretariat services in administration of the cases concerned. ICSID&#13;
also acted as appointing authority of arbitrators in proceedings developing under the&#13;
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Annex 2 provides details on the procedural developments in each of the proceedings con-&#13;
ducted under the ICSID Convention and the Additional Facility Rules which were pend-&#13;
ing before the Centre in FY 2005.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
PANELS OF CONCILIATORS AND OF ARBITRATORS&#13;
As required by the ICSID Convention, the Centre maintains a Panel of Conciliators and&#13;
a Panel of Arbitrators. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Convention, each ICSID Contracting&#13;
State may designate up to four persons to each Panel; up to 10 persons may be designated&#13;
by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The completeness of the ICSID Panels is an essential pre-requisite for the selection&#13;
of conciliators and of arbitrators in the substantially increased number of ICSID cases.&#13;
During the year, the Secretariat continued to remind a number of Contracting States of&#13;
the need to make or renew designations to the ICSID Panels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In FY 2005, fifteen Contracting States made designations to the ICSID Panels.These&#13;
include Barbados, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Chad, Costa Rica, Ecuador,&#13;
Indonesia, Ireland, Jamaica, Mongolia, Peru, Spain,Turkey and Uruguay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A listing of the designees appointed to the ICSID Panels of Conciliators and of&#13;
Arbitrators in FY 2005 appears in Annex 3.A complete listing of all 491 current mem-&#13;
bers of the ICSID Panels is available on the website of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PUBLICATIONS&#13;
In the past fiscal year,the Centre continued its publication and knowledge dissemination&#13;
activities.The 9th volume of ICSID's loose-leaf collection of InvestmentTreaties was launched&#13;
during the year.This collection,the only print version of its kind,was expanded by three&#13;
releases containing 60 bilateral investment agreements concluded by some 63 countries.&#13;
These brought the total number of the treaties included in the collection to 1,020.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Centre also continued to update its ten-volume loose-leaf service of Investment Laws&#13;
of theWorld. This collection contains basic investment legislation and contact informa-&#13;
tion for the national investment agencies of the featured countries.The release issued for&#13;
the Investment Laws of theWorld collection this year contains texts of investment legisla-&#13;
tion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Namibia,Turkey,Vietnam and&#13;
the Republic of Yemen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Two new issues of the ICSID Review--Foreign Investment Law Journal were published in&#13;
the period. The Spring 2004 issue of the journal contains articles on aspects of invest-&#13;
ment arbitration under UNCITRAL and ICSID rules; on recent interpretations by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
arbitral tribunals of provisions on most-favored-nation treatment contained in invest-&#13;
ment treaties; and on selected provisions of the Chile-U.S. FreeTrade Agreement.The&#13;
Fall 2004 issue of the ICSID Review contains articles on aspects of indirect expropriation&#13;
in international investment law; on the question of unilateral governmental statements as&#13;
applicable law in investment disputes; and on aspects of arbitration in the new generation&#13;
of U.S. investment treaties.The two issues also reproduce the texts of several decisions and&#13;
awards rendered in recent ICSID proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the year,the Centre also published two issues of its newsletter,News from ICSID.&#13;
The Summer 2004 issue reported on the results of the ICSID client survey and featured an&#13;
article on the resolution of oil and gas disputes at ICSID.TheWinter 2004 issue contained&#13;
an overview of legal aspects related to provisional measures within the ICSID system of&#13;
arbitration and provided a brief summary of the ICSID Secretariat's discussion paper on&#13;
proposed improvements of the framework for ICSID arbitration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the course of the year,developments in the ICSID caseload and the Centre's activities&#13;
were constantly reflected on the ICSID website,&lt;www.worldbank.org/icsid&gt;.The ICSID&#13;
Secretariat has employed the website as a means for informing the general public and&#13;
inviting a broad feedback on its proposals for improvement of the framework for ICSID&#13;
arbitration,and for making the results of the 2004 ICSID client survey widely available.A&#13;
newly established email account,&lt;ICSIDideas@worldbank.org&gt;,has opened a new chan-&#13;
nel of communication with the Centre and allowed for public comments on the Centre's&#13;
various initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A complete list of ICSID documents and publications is provided in Annex 4.&#13;

&#13;
CONFERENCES&#13;
In the fiscal year, ICSID co-sponsored, together with the American Arbitration&#13;
Association and the International Court of Arbitration at the International Chamber of&#13;
Commerce (ICC), the 21st in the series of annual colloquia on international arbitra-&#13;
tion. Hosted by ICC, the colloquium was held on November 19, 2004 in Paris.The&#13;
four panel discussions at the colloquium focused on multi-party and multi-contract&#13;
arbitration, on issues of anti-suit injunctions and other measures interfering with the&#13;
autonomy of arbitration, and on the rules of law applicable to disputes between State&#13;
entities and private companies.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
During the year ICSID organized,together with the Organisation for Economic&#13;
Co-operation and Development (OECD),a Joint Meeting on an Appeal Mechanism in&#13;
Investor-State Arbitration (held on November 20,2004 in Paris).To commemorate the 40th&#13;
Anniversary of the ICSID Convention and to honor Antonio R.Parra,Deputy-Secretary&#13;
General,on the occasion of his forthcoming retirement,the Centre arranged a roundtable&#13;
discussion (held on April 26,2005 inWashington,D.C.).In addition,ICSID co-sponsored&#13;
and hosted the 8th Biennial Conference of the International Federation of Commercial&#13;
Arbitration Institutions (IFCAI),which was dedicated to discussions of key current issues&#13;
in international arbitration (held on June 3,2005 inWashington,D.C.).The panel sessions&#13;
addressed issues specific to arbitration involving State parties,questions relating to party&#13;
autonomy and institutional rules,the ongoing work on amendment of the UNCITRAL&#13;
Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and conflicts of interest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The staff of the Secretariat contributed presentations at several further conferences&#13;
and seminars sponsored by other international organizations, arbitration institutions&#13;
and professional organizations.These events included a Seminar onTranslating for&#13;
International Financial Institutions (held on September 11, 2004 inWashington, D.C.);&#13;
a Special Session of the Investment Committee of the OECD with ICSID and gov-&#13;
ernmental legal experts on an appellate mechanism in investment disputes (held on&#13;
September 20, 2004 in Paris); a symposium on the implications of a possible bilateral&#13;
investment treaty between Pakistan and the United States (held on October 12, 2004&#13;

&#13;
NOTE 1 ­ ORGANIZATION&#13;
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre)&#13;
was established on October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbi-&#13;
tration of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States.The Centre&#13;
provides such facilities for cases brought under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID&#13;
Additional Facilities Rules, or where parties involved so request, under the Arbitration&#13;
Rules of the United Nation Commission on InternationalTrade Law. On February 13,&#13;
1967, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the&#13;
Centre entered into Administrative Arrangements which were effective as of the date of&#13;
the establishment of the Centre.The Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements (the&#13;
Memorandum) provides that, except to the extent that the Centre may charge the parties&#13;
to proceedings, for fees and expenses of members of Conciliation Commissions,Arbitral&#13;
Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the Bank shall provide facilities and services to the&#13;
Centre, as described in Notes 2 and 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 ­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#13;
Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation: The financial statements&#13;
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the&#13;
United States of America (US GAAP) and with International Financial Reporting Standards&#13;
(IFRS).Such financial statements are presented in accordance with Statement of Financial&#13;
Accounting Standard No.117,"Financial Statements of Not-For-Profit-Organizations"(SFAS&#13;
No.117).SFAS No.117 requires that net assets are classified in accordance with donor&#13;
restrictions;however,there are no net assets as of June 30,2005 and 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates:The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US&#13;
GAAP and IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the&#13;
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabili-&#13;
ties at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and&#13;
expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from these estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reclassification: Nonrefundable fees paid by parties to arbitration proceedings&#13;
previously recorded in miscellaneous revenue are now included in Revenues from&#13;
Arbitration Proceedings. Prior year figures have been reclassified to conform with the&#13;
current year presentation.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6 (CONTINUED)&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Under Investment Guidelines in place before January 2005,&#13;
liquidity equal to ICSID's liabilities and net assets was earmarked in the portfolio (see Share in&#13;
Pooled Investments below) and invested in instruments with terms of three months or less and&#13;
therefore classified as Cash and Cash Equivalents.Therefore,at June 30,2004,ICSID's share in&#13;
the portfolio of pooled investments was classified as Cash and Cash Equivalents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Share in Pooled Investments: Amounts paid to the Centre, but not yet disbursed, are&#13;
managed by the Bank, which maintains a single investment portfolio (the Pool) for all of&#13;
the trust funds administered by the Bank, the International Development Association, the&#13;
International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, (the&#13;
"World Bank Group") and the funds of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank maintains the Pool assets separate and apart from the funds of theWorld Bank&#13;
Group.Under the Pool's investment strategy adopted in January 2005,a significant portion&#13;
of the Pool is invested in liquid instruments such as money market deposits,U.S.Treasury&#13;
securities and other high-grade bonds.The pooled investments are reported at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank maintains the investments on a pooled accounting basis. Share in Pooled&#13;
Investments represents the Centre's pro-rata share of the Pool's fair value at the end of the&#13;
reporting period.The fair value is based on market quotations, where available. If quoted&#13;
market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of compa-&#13;
rable instruments.The corresponding proportionate realized and unrealized gains/losses&#13;
and interest income are accrued in the period in which they occur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Value of Services Provided by the Bank and In-kind Contributions: In accor-&#13;
dance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 116,"Accounting for&#13;
Contributions Received and Contributions Made", the value of services provided by the Bank&#13;
is determined by the estimated fair value of these services and is recorded by the Centre&#13;
as in-kind contributions and also as expenses of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank provides support services and facilities to the Centre including the following:&#13;
     (1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
     (2) other administrative services and facilities, such as travel, communications, office&#13;
          accommodations, furniture, equipment, supplies and printing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
44                                                                                         I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Revenue Recognition from Arbitration Proceedings:The Centre's direct expenses&#13;
attributable to arbitration proceedings are borne by the parties in accordance with the&#13;
Centre's Administrative and Financial Regulations (Regulations). In accordance with these&#13;
Regulations, the ICSID Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance deposits&#13;
with the Centre from time to time to defray these anticipated expenses.Accordingly, the&#13;
Centre recognizes revenues from these exchange transactions during the period of and to&#13;
the extent expenses are incurred related to arbitration proceedings.The Centre also rec-&#13;
ognizes revenue for the nonrefundable fees when collected from the parties to the arbitra-&#13;
tion proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investment of Undisbursed Advances from Parties and Refund of Surplus to&#13;
the Parties: The investment income accrues to the parties and can be used for expenses&#13;
related to arbitration proceedings.After the completion of an arbitration proceeding,if it is&#13;
determined that there is an excess of advances and investment income over expenditures&#13;
for the proceedings,the cash surplus shall be refunded to the parties in proportion to the&#13;
amounts advanced by each party to the Centre.If the parties fail to provide the Centre&#13;
with the information necessary to process the refund,the surplus will be transferred to the&#13;
Bank and applied to reduce the Bank's in-kind contribution to the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Current/Non-current Distinction: All ICSID assets and liabilities are considered cur-&#13;
rent as they are expected to be realized or settled in the Centre's normal operating cycle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Accounting and Reporting Developments:&#13;
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) Improvements Project -- In December 2003,&#13;
as a part of its improvements project, the IASB issued fifteen revised standards to elimi-&#13;
nate redundancies and conflicts between existing standards.These revised standards are&#13;
to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005. Of the fifteen&#13;
standards issued, the following are relevant to ICSID: IAS 1, Presentation of Financial&#13;
Statements; IAS 8,Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors;&#13;
IAS 10, Events after Balance Sheet Date; and IAS 24, Related Party Disclosure.The&#13;
Centre is still assessing the impact of IAS 1 and IAS 24 on its financial reporting.The&#13;
Centre has reviewed the remaining applicable standards and determined that only IAS 8&#13;
may have an impact on its financial reporting. Since IAS 8 requires that, in the absence&#13;
of specific transitional provisions applying to a change in accounting policy (including&#13;
adoption of a new standard), any such change should be applied retroactively, it will&#13;
affect ICSID's application and presentation of future accounting changes in its financial&#13;
reporting in future fiscal years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 0 5                                                            45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 6 (CONTINUED)&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other IASB Amendments -- In December 2003,the IASB released revised IAS 32,Financial&#13;
Instruments:Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39,Financial Instruments Recognition&#13;
and Measurement.These standards replace IAS 32 (revised 2000),and supersede IAS 39&#13;
(revised 2000),and should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,&#13;
2005.The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Centre's finan-&#13;
cial statements.In addition to IAS 39 (Revised),further amendments were subsequently&#13;
made to IAS 39,relating to (i)Transition and Initial Recognition of Financial Assets and&#13;
Financial Liabilities,(ii) Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast IntragroupTransactions,&#13;
(iii) FairValue Hedge Accounting for a Portfolio Hedge of Interest rate Risk and (iv) the&#13;
FairValue Option.The Centre is still evaluating the FairValue Option amendment which&#13;
is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,2006,with specific transi-&#13;
tion rules for existing IFRS preparers.The Centre does not expect that the adoption of the&#13;
other amendments would have an impact on its financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
New FASB Pronouncements -- In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standard Board&#13;
(FASB) issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.This statement in&#13;
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning&#13;
after December 15, 2005 and may have an impact on the Centre's financial reporting.As&#13;
this standard requires that, in the absence of specific transitional provisions applying to&#13;
a change in accounting policy (including adoption of a new standard), any such change&#13;
should be applied retroactively, it will affect ICSID's application and presentation of future&#13;
accounting changes in its financial reporting in future fiscal years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 ­ FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
The Pool is actively managed and invested in accordance with the investments strategy&#13;
established for all trust funds administered by theWorld Bank Group.The objectives of&#13;
the investment strategy are foremost to maintain adequate liquidity to meet foreseeable&#13;
cash flow needs and preserve capital and then to maximize investment returns.The Centre&#13;
is exposed to market, credit, and liquidity risks.The risk management policies employed&#13;
to manage these risks are discussed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Market risk -- The risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result&#13;
of changes in market prices or changes in interest rates.The Pool is actively managed&#13;
so that the probability of incurring negative returns over a three-year cycle is no more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46                                                                                       I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
than 1%.The duration of the Pool is managed to limit the exposure to adverse interest&#13;
rate movements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Credit risk --The risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an&#13;
obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.The Bank invests the pooled&#13;
assets in liquid instruments such as money market deposits, U.S.Treasury securities and&#13;
other high-grade bonds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquidity risk -- The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in raising liquid funds&#13;
to meet its commitments.The Bank maintains a significant portion of the Pool in short-&#13;
term money market deposits to meet all liquidity requirements of trust funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 4 ­ SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE BANK AS IN-KIND CONTRIBUTIONS&#13;
Fees related to the nonrefundable fees and the sales of publications earned by the Centre&#13;
are remitted to the Bank as partial reimbursements for the services provided by the Bank.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            On April 26, 2005, ICSID celebrated the
            fortieth anniversary of the signing of the ICSID Convention.
            As a multilateral legal framework for international
            investment dispute settlement, the ICSID Convention has come
            to have a profound influence on the development of
            international investment law and has contributed to improve
            the investment climate in developing countries, a topic
            which remains at the forefront of the development agenda.
            ICSID registered twenty-five new cases during the fiscal
            year, bringing to 184 the total number of cases registered
            by the Centre since its inception. With these new
            registrations, ICSID administered a record 103 cases during
            a single year. Membership of the Centre rose to 142 States
            following the ratification of the ICSID Convention by
            Cambodia and Yemen.  This anniversary coincides with a shift
            in leadership following the decision of Antonio R. Parra,
            Deputy Secretary-General, to retire from ICSID after almost
            two decades. ICSID has thus begun a process of strategic
            planning for the years ahead. Central to these efforts is a
            constructive dialogue with stakeholders regarding their
            perception of the strengths and weaknesses of the ICSID
            process and their recommendations for the future development
            of the institution.
