countries, including 13urkina Faso, Ghana, Mali,&#13;

IDA extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are undertaking major adjustment efforts but are not creditworthy&#13;
for IBRD lending. An exception has been made for small island economies (see footnote e)&#13;
e An exception to the GNI per capita operational cutoff for IDA eligibility ($875 for fiscal 2003) has been made for some small island economies, which otherwise&#13;
would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack creditworthiness. For such countries, IDA funding is considered case by case for the&#13;
financing of projects and adjustmernt programs designed to strengthen creditworth ness.&#13;
