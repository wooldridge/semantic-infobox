VIETNAM&#13;
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Population and Development&#13;
1.1         Vietnam is the second most populous country in Southeast Asia with a&#13;
1995 population of 74 million projected to reach 80 million by 2000. About 15&#13;
million (20%) of the population is urban. Four major cities Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi,&#13;
Danang and Haiphong account for 37% of the urban population with the remainder&#13;
living in about 500 locations. About 80% of the urban population is concentrated in&#13;
77 cities with population over 15,000.&#13;
1.2         Literacy (over 90t for adult males and females) and life expectancy (68&#13;
years) are above the less developed country (LDC) averages while access to safe&#13;
water supply (50% urban, 25% rural) is below the LDC average. Lack of safe water and&#13;
adequate sanitation facilities are the major causes of Vietnam's higher incidence&#13;
of water-borne and hygiene-related diseases such as gastroenteritis, dysentery,&#13;
typhoid, cholera and hepatitis which also contribute to childhood morbidity and&#13;
mortality. The ten leading causes of morbidity and mortality are practically all due&#13;
to communicable diseases, most of them preventable.&#13;
1.3         Economic growth has accelerated with the introduction of reforms in&#13;
1986. Since then it has averaged around 7-8 percent per annum leading to increased&#13;
urbanization (estimated to grow by 70% in next ten years) and rising urban incomes.&#13;
Foreign investment has been attracted to Vietnam but limited by infrastructure&#13;
constraints in urban areas. Infrastructure in most cities and towns, laid at the end&#13;
of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, has not been adequately maintained&#13;
or upgraded because of resource constraints.&#13;
1.4         The Government has responded to the above by adopting in 1991 the Socio-&#13;
Economic Stabilization and Development Strategy to the Year 2000. The aspects of the&#13;
strategy relevant to the proposed project are to:&#13;
(i)   focus limited resources available to develop infrastructure to promote&#13;
investment in services and industries in three priority areas: (a) Hanoi-Haiphong-&#13;
Quang Ninh; (b) Ho Chi Minh City-Bien Hoa-Vung Tau; and (c) the Danang area;&#13;
(ii) streamline the number of line ministries, focus policy-making within the&#13;
central government and decentralize implementation to local governments; and&#13;
(iii) improve the management mechanism of state enterprises, experiment and&#13;
gradually expand the transformation of state enterprises into private companies.&#13;
B. Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
1.5         Water supply and sanitation infrastructure has been affected by extreme&#13;
resource constraints in the past, by lack of access to quality materials due to&#13;
isolation of the Vietnamese economy, by the socio-political necessity for state&#13;
enterprises to spread resources thinly in providing basic services free or for&#13;
minimum fee to as many as possible, and by the acceptance of minimal service&#13;
standards by consumers during times of national adversity. Given the conditions, the&#13;
performance of the Water Supply Companies (WSCs) has been quite remarkable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.6         Piped water is available to about 50% of the urban population with&#13;
access ranging between 60%-80% in large cities and under 30% in other towns.&#13;
However, material quality, cumulative deferred maintenance over decades, and&#13;
inadequate expansion have taken their toll. Pumping and treatment facilities are&#13;
overloaded and inefficient with ageing and non-compatible equipment leading to unit&#13;
power consumption double international averages while distribution systems leak&#13;
excessively. As a result, service is intermittent with low pressure, per capita&#13;
water availability is low (below 120 liters per capita per day - lcd) and 80% of the&#13;
water supplied does not meet national water quality standards. In addition, WSCs&#13;
have been oriented towards using subsidies to meet social targets with minimal&#13;
incentive to recover costs from user charges. Therefore, billing and collection&#13;
functions have been neglected. Physical water loss and inadequate billing and&#13;
collection have combined to yield non-revenue water (NRW)1 of over 50% in some WSCs.&#13;
1.7         Urban sanitation facilities have suffered similarly. Sewerage coverage,&#13;
at 60% of population, is higher in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) but low in other cities,&#13;
including Hanoi (30%) . The collection network is in need of extensive repair and&#13;
treatment of wastewater is non-existent leading to pollution of inner city waterways&#13;
and groundwater. Solid waste collection in city centers is well organized but&#13;
disposal suffers from lack of proper landfills. No facilities exist for disposal of&#13;
hazardous and industrial waste.&#13;
C. Sectoral Issues&#13;
1.8         The objective of rapidly overcoming the overwhelming quantitative and&#13;
qualitative deficiencies resulting from prolonged under-investment defines the key&#13;
sectoral problems. These pertain to mobilization of the resources required;&#13;
formulation of a sector strategy to most effectively utilize available resources and&#13;
to increase resource mobilization in the future; selection of a sector structure&#13;
best suited to achieving sector objectives; organization of enterprise management&#13;
to ensure financial sustainability of investments; and control of construction&#13;
quality to ensure physical sustainability of the assets provided. Second order&#13;
issues resulting from the pursuit of rapid sector development pertain to the&#13;
protection of vulnerable social groups and prevention of negative environmental&#13;
impacts.&#13;
1.9         Concerning mobilization of resources for the sector,  it has to be&#13;
recognized that at present the aggregate requirement of all infrastructure sectors&#13;
exceeds available resources resulting in allocations for particular sectors that are&#13;
insufficient to meet total demand. While private capital is flowing to Vietnam,&#13;
returns in a number of sectors are presently higher than those available in the&#13;
water supply and sanitation sector. Thus prioritization in the use of available&#13;
allocated resources and efforts to increase the attractiveness to private capital&#13;
are important sectoral issues.&#13;
1.10        The transition to a market economy in Vietnam gives rise to especially&#13;
challenging sectoral concerns. Sector policies, strategy, structure and organization&#13;
1 Non-revenue water (NRW) refers to the water produced that does not bring in revenue, inter alia, due to&#13;
losses in the network (leaks), pilferage, non-billing and inaccurate metering.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
need to be compatible with an environment changing from a supply to a demand&#13;
orientation. Presently the most significant steps required pertain to the re-&#13;
orientation of enterprise management to providing water and sanitation services as&#13;
a business rather than exclusively as a social obligation, to the gradual&#13;
replacement of subsidies by user charges, and to the increased ability of&#13;
enterprises to make rational business decisions without unnecessary political&#13;
control. At the same time, because of the natural monopoly characteristic of the&#13;
sector, the role of state agencies needs to evolve into that of regulators rather&#13;
than providers of service (para 4.1).&#13;
1.11        Issues arising from the existence of a sector monopoly in a low-income,&#13;
market economy need to be anticipated. These pertain to consumer and environmental&#13;
protection and ensuring universal access in the case of an essential commodity like&#13;
water. Adequate regulation and tariff design are needed to take care of consumer&#13;
concerns while project and program planning are needed to cater for environmental&#13;
consequences of increased water supplies (para 5.3).&#13;
D. Government Strateqy for the Sector&#13;
1.12        Both supply and demand side considerations consequent  to economic&#13;
reforms have led the Government to focus attention on the water sector. Inadequate&#13;
infrastructure could undermine plans to attract foreign investment and tourism while&#13;
increased urbanization could overwhelm existing facilities and lead to social&#13;
dissatisfaction. Proposed environmental legislation requires improvements in water&#13;
quality and rising incomes and higher user charges increase consumer expectations&#13;
for better service levels. Thus, resource allocation for both quantitative and&#13;
qualitative investments is required.&#13;
1.13        Based on a UNDP/World Bank Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Study&#13;
(1990)  and a Finnish-funded National Urban Water Supply Strategy  (1994),  the&#13;
Government has formulated a two-stage sector development strategy. The first stage&#13;
focuses on system rehabilitation and renovation to meet demand up to the year 2000&#13;
and on institutional strengthening of the WSCs to ensure that the physical&#13;
investments are sustainable. The second stage would address demand and capacity&#13;
expansion beyond the year 2000.&#13;
1.14        Physical targets in the strategy's first stage call for development in&#13;
53 provincial towns to serve 70-80o of their population. Estimated investments to&#13;
attain these goals would be of the order of US$ 1 billion. This far exceeds the&#13;
sectoral allocation of the Government. Since, at this stage, the country risks&#13;
remain too high, individual project size relatively small, and financial returns&#13;
inadequate to attract substantial private sector investment, the Government has&#13;
decided to request financing for the key cities targeted for priority development&#13;
(para 1.4) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for HCMC and IDA for Hanoi,&#13;
Haiphong, Danang and Quang Ninh; for the other towns it decided to use bilateral&#13;
low-cost or grant financing contributions as much as available.&#13;
1.15        The accompanying institutional strengthening aims to ensure that the&#13;
physical investments are sustained and operated efficiently. Elements of the&#13;
strengthening being coordinated with the State Enterprise Reform Program include&#13;
decentralization of responsibility to the provincial level; increased autonomy for&#13;
WSCs with elimination of overlapping jurisdictions; re-orientation of WSCs on a more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
commercial foundation; increased cost recovery through user charges and gradual&#13;
elimination of central subsidies. Considerable external development support has also&#13;
been directed at institutional strengthening of national sector agencies to improve&#13;
capabilities to plan and prepare sector strategies and projects, to develop policy&#13;
guidelines, standards and procurement and construction guidelines, and to strengthen&#13;
project management, implementation and monitoring capacity.&#13;
1.16        The Government strategy does include involvement of the private sector&#13;
through Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects for bulk water provision mostly for&#13;
industrial estates where commercial tariffs are presently considered affordable.&#13;
However, water provision to urban customers is planned to remain the responsibility&#13;
of reformed State Enterprises at least in the first stage to the year 2000.&#13;
E. IDA Strategy and Rationale for Involvement&#13;
1.17        The IDA approach formulated in the Country Assistance Strategy2 is in&#13;
agreement with the Government's two-stage sector development plan which is based on&#13;
the UNDP/World Bank Sector Study and the National Urban Water Supply Strategy. The&#13;
CAS identifies poor infrastructure as a key bottleneck to development, transition&#13;
to a market economy as a prime objective and reform of State Enterprises as an&#13;
important goal. The CAS states that the Bank would take the lead among donors to&#13;
help the Government plan and finance infrastructure. Commercialization of the WSCs&#13;
would also indirectly support the goal of poverty alleviation by redirecting&#13;
existing subsidies to WSCs for other activities with higher social returns.&#13;
1.18        The IDA strategy places greater emphasis on institutional strengthening&#13;
of the WSCs to ensure that the investments are sustained and operated efficiently&#13;
and that the sector becomes attractive for private sector participation. However,&#13;
it is clear that institutional improvements alone are not sufficient to meet the&#13;
targets for the year 2000. In particular, water services cannot be improved without&#13;
increasing the capacity and operational efficiency of treatment plants and physical&#13;
leakages cannot be reduced without major replacement of obsolete tertiary pipelines.&#13;
In addition, improved revenue collection requires investment in metering of&#13;
household connections. Thus the IDA strategy is based on a judicious mix of&#13;
essential physical investments supported by the institutional development necessary&#13;
to sustain the physical investments. Available documentation confirms that the ADB&#13;
is also following a similar strategy for its investment in HCM City.&#13;

II. SERVICES IN THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. The Project Area&#13;
2.1         Based on the Government's regional priorities (para 1.4), the project&#13;
would include investments in Hanoi, Haiphong, Danang and Halong City/Cam Pha (Quang&#13;
Ninh province). Hanoi-Haiphong-Quang Ninh form the northern economic triangle and&#13;
Danang is the focal point for development in central Vietnam. Danang (close to the&#13;
historic city of Hue) and Halong City (located on Halong Bay, a UNESCO World&#13;
Heritage site) are also marked for development as tourist attractions. Hanoi,&#13;
Haiphong and Danang are cities with provincial status.&#13;
B. Population&#13;
2.2         Hanoi is the national capital and second largest municipality after HCM&#13;
City. Urban population was 1.1 million in 1995 and is expected to reach 1.5 million&#13;
by 2010. The urban area is projected to grow from 50 km2 in 1990 to 83 km2 in 2010.&#13;
Haiphong is the main seaport in northern Vietnam and the fourth largest&#13;
municipality. Urban population was 430,000 in 1995 and is projected to reach 600,000&#13;
by 2010. The urban area is 20 km2. Danang, is the major deep-water seaport in&#13;
central Vietnam with good access to communications networks through National Highway&#13;
#1 and the Trans-Vietnam railway. It is the third largest municipality in the&#13;
country. The 1995 urban population of 450,000 is expected to reach 600,000 by 2010.&#13;
2.3         Quang Ninh province, the country's principal coal exporter, is situated&#13;
about 160 km northeast of Hanoi. It is small province with a population of 900,000,&#13;
of which about 36% (320,000) are urban. The two urban communities, Halong City and&#13;
Cam Pha, are both important ports. Halong City is the provincial capital; it's&#13;
western section (Bai Chai) is developing a tourist center separated from the rest&#13;
of the city by the mouth of the Dien Vong River. Cam Pha lies along the coast to&#13;
the northeast, about 20 km from Halong City. The combined population of the two&#13;
cities is expected to grow from 278,000 in 1995 to 500,000 in 2010, mainly by&#13;
absorbing neighboring districts into an urban agglomeration.&#13;
C. Water Supply&#13;
2.4         Water supply services are provided to domestic, commercial, industrial&#13;
and institutional consumers by provincial WSCs responsible to the provincial&#13;
People's Committees (PCs) . In 1995, the Hanoi Water Business Company (WBC) served&#13;
900,000 residents (82% of the urban population) and other consumers through 123,000&#13;
connections and 1000 standposts. Average production was 320,000 m3/d of which 69%&#13;
was NRW.   Estimated domestic consumption was 120 lcd. The Haiphong WSC served&#13;
420,000 residents (98% of the urban population) and the others through 56,000&#13;
connections and 650 standposts. Average production was 125,000 m3/d of which about&#13;
69% was NRW. The Danang WSC served 191,000 residents (47% of the urban population)&#13;
and the others through 21,000 connections. Average production was 52,000 m3/d, of&#13;
which 33% was NRW. The Quang Ninh WSC served 43,200 residents (15% of the urban&#13;
population) and the others through 13,000 connections.   Average production was&#13;
28,000 m3/d of which 56% was NRW.&#13;
2.5         Of the total connections, 25% are metered in Hanoi, 56% in Haiphong,&#13;
100% in Danang and 50% in Quang Ninh. Numerous meters are out of order and many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
commercial establishments are registered as domestic consumers qualifying for a&#13;
lower tariff. Non-metered domestic consumers are billed a fixed monthly charge based&#13;
on an estimated consumption of 3-6 m3 per capita per month. Non-metered commercial&#13;
and industrial consumers are charged based on negotiated contracts related to&#13;
estimated monthly usage. Both situations lead to excessive water use, sharing of&#13;
connections between families, incentives for meter tampering and leakage of revenue&#13;
in contracts based on estimation of monthly usage.&#13;
2.6         With some exceptions in Hanoi, the condition of water supply facilities&#13;
is poor and treatment facilities are overloaded. Existing water demand cannot be&#13;
met, large segments of population must use private, unhygienic wells where&#13;
groundwater is accessible, and the quality of piped water is below national&#13;
standards. Tertiary distribution networks have not been developed in any of the&#13;
cities. They have been replaced by extremely long individual connections (spaghetti&#13;
connections)  that draw water directly from mains.   However,  these were never&#13;
pressurized over one bar; also, external and internal corrosion is common, and&#13;
joints and fittings are leaking, generally beyond repair (see Annex 1 for a detailed&#13;
description of water supply, sewerage and solid waste services).&#13;
D. Sewerage. Drainage and Solid Waste&#13;
2.7         Sewerage service is provided by the Sewerage and Drainage Companies&#13;
(SDCs) in Hanoi and Haiphong and Urban Environment Companies (URENCOs) in Danang,&#13;
Halong City and Cam Pha.  In addition to sewerage and drainage, URENCOs manage&#13;
street cleaning, solid waste collection and disposal, and maintain public toilets,&#13;
parks and street lights. The SDCs and URENCOs are State Enterprises but unlike WSCs&#13;
are responsible to municipal and not to provincial PCs.&#13;
2.8         The existing drains are combined sewers' serving city centers. They are&#13;
over 50 years old, built during the French period. Hanoi SDC maintains 120 km of&#13;
sewers and 35 km of open channels serving about 30% of the urban area; the Haiphong&#13;
SDC maintains 170 km serving three urban districts; the Danang URENCO maintains 37&#13;
km serving about 30% of the urban area and the Halong and Cam Pha URENCOs maintain&#13;
about 53 km. The systems are overloaded and in poor condition, often flood severely&#13;
for extended periods, and discharge wastewater without treatment. The population&#13;
without access to the sewer systems uses on-site sanitation, mostly septic tanks&#13;
without adequate drain fields. Only about 35%-40% of the solid waste generated is&#13;
collected. The rest is burned or buried at the source or scattered. The existing&#13;
landfills do not comply with environmental and health requirements, are mostly&#13;
filled, and will need to be closed soon.&#13;
E. Project Demand and Rationale&#13;
2.9         In 1991, the Government asked the IDA to help prepare a water supply and&#13;
sanitation project to remedy the above-mentioned deficiencies in the four cities.&#13;
The objective of the water supply component was to meet coverage and consumption&#13;
' Combined sewers provide the service in one pipe for surface water drainage as well as wastewater, which&#13;
must first pass through septic tanks (or suitable pre-treatment) to remove solids and toxins before entering the sewer.&#13;
Separate sewers provide a separate pipe for each service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
targets for the year 2000, improve water quality, rehabilitate facilities, reduce&#13;
physical leakages and to improve institutional capacity of the WSCs. The objective&#13;
of the sanitation component was to rehabilitate drainage and sewerage networks,&#13;
improve flood protection, improve solid waste management, provide new sanitary&#13;
landfills, and strengthen operating agencies. During preparation, however, it was&#13;
found that the great number of involved institutions with various financial&#13;
objectives would make the project very complex (para 3.4) . It was decided,&#13;
therefore, to reformulate the initial project into a water supply project to be&#13;
processed first and a sanitation project to follow later.&#13;
2.10        Investments  in the water  supply  sector are needed now.  Deferred&#13;
investments have had a negative effect on national development plans and the quality&#13;
of urban life and further delays would increase the final cost of rehabilitation.&#13;
Historic funding levels have been low. During 1983-86, urban water supply&#13;
expenditures were less than 1.5% of the Government's total capital investments,&#13;
while provincial contributions to water supply projects accounted for 5-7% of total&#13;
provincial budgets. Allocations increased to 6% of total central Government&#13;
investment by 1989, but decreased in real terms, from US$ 8.3 million in 1983 to US$&#13;
0.4 million in 1989. Including provincial capital allocations, this corresponded to&#13;
an overall investment volume of US$ 0.56 million in 1989. Similarly, capital&#13;
investment levels in sewerage and waste removal in the three major cities was less&#13;
than US$ 1.5 million by 19922.&#13;
2.11        While the low funding partially reflects the low absorptive capacity of&#13;
the sector, the constraints have been gradually removed. Progressive reforms have&#13;
delegated more responsibilities to the provinces and increased the autonomy and&#13;
responsibilities of the WSCs including the ability to borrow for capital expansion.&#13;
At the same time, the provinces have allowed the WSCs to retain funds that were&#13;
earlier paid back to the province (e.g., depreciation charges) in order to augment&#13;
their ability to self-finance their operations. Tariffs have also been increased&#13;
significantly in real terms and subsidies have been curtailed to move the WSCs&#13;
towards a more customer and efficiency oriented mode of operation. While&#13;
institutional reforms need to continue, they have progressed to the stage where&#13;
project investments in the WSCs are feasible.&#13;
2.12        There  are  no  viable  project  alternatives.  From  a  development&#13;
perspective, the investment forms an integral part of the overall development of the&#13;
three key economic regions identified by the Government. From a financing&#13;
perspective, Government resources are insufficient and private sector investment is&#13;
not forthcoming at present without tariff increases that would be politically and&#13;
socially unsustainable3.  From an engineering perspective, complete replacement of&#13;
the run-down systems would be prohibitively expensive and presently unaffordable.&#13;
Use of development assistance for judicious rehabilitation of existing assets,&#13;
2 Historical investments in the sector are reported in "Business Opportunities in Vietnam in the Water&#13;
Supply and Sanitation Sector," GKW Consult, 1994. The report is available in the project file.&#13;
3 The long run marginal cost of water in Hanoi is presently estimated to be more than double the existing&#13;
average water tariff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
essential capacity expansion and institutional change to increase operational&#13;
efficiency remains the least cost and most affordable alternative.&#13;
F. Related Projects and Lessons Learnt&#13;
2.13        As a result of low national funding allocations and Vietnam's economic&#13;
isolation, international counterpart financing in the water sector has been slow.&#13;
Assistance to the sector since 1985 has not exceeded US$ 100 million. The most&#13;
significant projects which can yield useful lessons have been financed by.Finnida.&#13;
The first project in Hanoi is now in its third and final phase with cumulative&#13;
investment up to 1995 of US$80 million. The second project started in Haiphong in&#13;
1990 and cumulative investment has been approximately US$20 million.&#13;
2.14        Valuable lessons can be derived from a comparison of the experiences of&#13;
the two projects. The Hanoi project was started in 1985 before sector reforms were&#13;
initiated in Vietnam and, as an emergency, was managed by a contractor focusing on&#13;
physical investments. While significant physical investments have been made in the&#13;
network and water quality has improved, WBC performance and customer service levels&#13;
have not shown commensurate improvement. After 10 years, NRW remains above 60%.&#13;
Lessons from the Hanoi experience have been utilized in the design of the Haiphong&#13;
project with better results. There has been a greater emphasis on initial&#13;
engineering preparation and institutional development; the community-based model&#13;
chosen for system rehabilitation at the neighborhood level has reduced NRW from over&#13;
60% to below 40% in the rehabilitated areas.&#13;
2.15        However,  further explanation is needed for the differences  since&#13;
institutional development efforts initiated in Hanoi since 1990 have not yielded&#13;
similar results. Part of the reason lies in the nature of the physical systems in&#13;
the two cities. Hanoi, with easy access to groundwater, has never generated&#13;
sufficient pressure on the PC or WBC management to change established modes of&#13;
operation. By contrast, Haiphong with no access to groundwater was faced with acute&#13;
water scarcity in the summer of 1993 with rioting directed against the WSC resulting&#13;
in the death of a company employee. As a result, the PC changed the WSC management,&#13;
and gave a clear mandate to the new Director to show results. The combination of&#13;
accountability from above and pressure from below provided the driving force for&#13;
improved performance. These lessons are being incorporated in the project by&#13;
institutionalizing the two driving forces through annual performance agreements&#13;
between the PCs and WSCs and public performance audits to increase consumer&#13;
involvement (paras 4.19 &amp; 4.21).&#13;
2.16        Analysis of the Danang WSC confirms the above observations.  Acute&#13;
scarcity of water owing to very limited treatment capacity has forced PC involvement&#13;
and WSC efficiency in operations. As a result 100% of the connections are metered,&#13;
disconnection policies are strictly enforced, and billing and collection monitored.&#13;
As a result NRW is about 33% and performance bonuses from retained earnings yield&#13;
employee salaries double those in Hanoi. This confirms the assessment that&#13;
significant improvements can be made to the distribution system and the methods&#13;
employed for metering, billing and collection, often without major capital&#13;
expenditure. Therefore, these components are an essential part of the project and&#13;
the basis for projecting NRW to decrease from over 60% in some WSCs to about 40% by&#13;
the time steady state conditions are achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.17        The Hanoi and Haiphong experiences also suggest lessons for the design&#13;
of institutional and technical assistance components. While this remains a&#13;
contentious issue, appraisal assessment is that the strategy of seconding long-term&#13;
advisors as management counterparts without time-bound, task-specific assignments&#13;
subject to periodic evaluation is not the most cost effective. Lack of a credible&#13;
option of withdrawing advisors if essential recommendations are not implemented&#13;
undermines project effectiveness and is ultimately counterproductive. Technical&#13;
assistance components in the project will be focused on specific, monitorable tasks&#13;
to be completed within specified time periods. Inclusion of Hanoi in the project was&#13;
made conditional on the introduction of a credible program to reduce NRW. The PC&#13;
responded with a concrete measure, signing a contract with an international private&#13;
water operator to initiate customer management in one supply district. The first&#13;
phase of the contract is due to be completed in March 1997 and the current results&#13;
are promising.&#13;
2.18        While the project would be the first IDA involvement in the sector and&#13;
first project to deal with subnational entities, lessons based on the Bank's global&#13;
experience are incorporated in the project design. The principal lesson is that&#13;
sector projects should not be used as vehicles to pursue subsidiary objectives at&#13;
the expense of the main objective. Thus tariffs should not be distorted to satisfy&#13;
poverty alleviation objectives; instead, direct subsidies should be provided to&#13;
needy households, if warranted. Similarly, water supply projects should not be used&#13;
to develop the construction industry if such development affects construction&#13;
quality. Dividing procurement packages into small contracts with the simplest sub-&#13;
components (e.g., house and meter connections) reserved for the smallest and least&#13;
experienced contractors has yielded an extremely expensive lesson. Poor construction&#13;
of such sub-components results in over 95k of physical leakages which are hard to&#13;
detect and expensive to repair because the assets are underground. The procurement&#13;
arrangements for the project have been designed to eliminate such problems.&#13;
2.19        Cautionary lessons have been learnt from the experience of the ADB&#13;
financed project in HCM City. The project which was signed in 1994 was suspended in&#13;
December 1996 because of slow implementation and disbursement. The project included&#13;
33 procurement packages each of which had to be evaluated and separately approved&#13;
by the Prime Minister. As the first multilateral funded projects at the provincial&#13;
level in a changing sector environment, it is to be expected that unanticipated new&#13;
issues would arise during project preparation and implementation that would take&#13;
time and patience to resolve.&#13;
2.20        Another key lesson from the Bank's global experience is to avoid trying&#13;
to do to much in one project and to refrain from attempting policy or procedural&#13;
changes that cut across sectors. The project design is not over-ambitious and&#13;
recognizes that all sector objectives cannot be achieved in one project because of&#13;
the constraints imposed by the realities on the ground (first time borrower, first&#13;
project dealing directly with State Enterprises at the sub-national level, a&#13;
transition economy in which sector policies are not firmly established, provincial&#13;
and enterprise management relatively unfamiliar with the requirements of market-&#13;
based operations, low staff salaries, consumer affordability considerations, limited&#13;
counterpart funds, limited debt service capability and limited absorptive capacity).&#13;
Therefore, the project has been designed as part of a careful, phased strategy&#13;
structured around an investment program comprising in the four cities at least two&#13;
separate water supply and sanitation projects each. The first water supply project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
includes measures that are most critical and yield the greatest immediate benefits&#13;
while setting in motion policy reforms and actions that would ensure the successful&#13;
attainment of all objectives by the completion of the investment program. However,&#13;
reform of generic problems cutting across sectors such as unsystematic loan&#13;
processing procedures or cumbersome funds flow arrangements at the country level are&#13;
not and cannot be addressed through the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Oriqin and History&#13;
3.1         The Government's  goal with respect  to urban water supply and&#13;
sanitation is to improve the quality of drinking water and waste water, to&#13;
develop infrastructure to meet defined targets and to commercialize the operating&#13;
companies. To achieve these objectives, it has sought external financing. In&#13;
1991, it requested IDA funding for a water supply and sanitation project in four&#13;
major cities and secured bilateral assistance to prepare the project from Finland&#13;
(for Hanoi and Haiphong), Denmark (for Quang Ninh) and Australia (for Danang).&#13;
3.2         Project processing was held up till 1993 because of delays in signing&#13;
agreements between the Government and bilateral donors. Project reviews in 1993&#13;
identified project complexity as a major risk since water supply, sewerage and&#13;
sanitation services are provided by different companies with different funding&#13;
arrangements. However, it was decided to proceed with the project design on the&#13;
grounds that the Ministry of Construction (MOC), responsible for urban water&#13;
supply and sanitation at the national level, would coordinate the project&#13;
components. As part of project preparation, technical assistance was arranged&#13;
from Australian aid to strengthen the regulatory capacity of the MOC.&#13;
3.3         However,  in  1995,  further  to  the  decentralization  of  sector&#13;
responsibilities to the provincial level, the Government decided that MOC would&#13;
remain actively responsible for managing projects only in secondary cities. Major&#13;
cities, which included those in the IDA-assisted project, would be directly&#13;
responsible for their projects. While institutionally this constituted a step in&#13;
the right direction, freeing the WSCs from parallel chains of command,&#13;
operationally it resulted in the project design becoming unmanageable.&#13;
3.4         As a result, it was agreed to divide the initial project into two,&#13;
a water supply project, to be processed first and a sanitation project to follow&#13;
later, and to outline a sector investment program for the four cities as follows:&#13;
(a) Water Supply Project to be implemented in 1997 to rehabilitate existing&#13;
facilities and meet demand up to 2000; (b) Sanitation Project to be implemented&#13;
in 1999 to restore functionality of existing sewerage and drainage facilities,&#13;
to provide septic tank maintenance program and to improve solid waste management&#13;
including construction of sanitary landfills; (c) Second Water Supply Project to&#13;
be implemented from 2000 to expand capacity to meet demand up to 2010; and (d)&#13;
Second Sanitation Project to be implemented in 2002 to expand wastewater&#13;
collection and treatment to handle the increased water production resulting from&#13;
the Second Water Supply Project. The sanitation projects would exclude sewerage&#13;
and drainage in Hanoi which is being funded by OECF of Japan and possibly solid&#13;
waste management. Both the Second Water Supply Project and the Second Sanitation&#13;
Project would be prepared within the respective first projects.&#13;
B. Objectives and Design&#13;
3.5         The aims of the first water supply project in the four cities are to:&#13;
(a) improve the quality of water supply services in Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh&#13;
and Danang through renovation of existing facilities in order to satisfy demand&#13;
up to 2000 of about 2.5 million people in the cities; (b) ensure sustainability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
of the physical investments by developing the institutional capabilities of water&#13;
supply agencies, facilitating their commercialization, and upgrading their staff&#13;
skills through training; and (c) assist in preparation of a future investment&#13;
program to satisfy water demand after 2000.&#13;
3.6         At the present time, a project based on concessional financing,&#13;
maximum rehabilitation of existing facilities, limited capacity expansion and&#13;
concentrated institutional improvements is the dominant, least cost alternative.&#13;
Government resources are insufficient and private investment is not forthcoming&#13;
in distribution of essential services because of unfavorable risk/return&#13;
characteristics. Large scale replacement of existing facilities is unaffordable&#13;
since tariff increases to meet full cost recovery are only possible in a&#13;
graduated manner because of social and political implications.&#13;
3.7         To ensure that the selection of engineering sub-components conformed&#13;
to the specific needs and preferences of the individual cities, the following&#13;
mechanism was adopted. Based on an initial assessment of the financial capacity&#13;
of the WSCs, an investment envelope was allocated to the WSC. The WSCs, in&#13;
collaboration with engineering consultants, identified alternative sub-components&#13;
to meet given project objectives (coverage, consumption and quality targets)&#13;
which were assigned weights depending upon the specific situation of each city.&#13;
Sub-components were ranked based on their overall impact measured in terms of&#13;
expected contribution to each target weighted by the importance of the target.&#13;
The rankings, made independently by consultants and WSCs, were discussed in a&#13;
meeting attended by members of the provincial administration, and the highest&#13;
ranked sub-components within the investment envelope were included in the&#13;
project. The remaining sub-components were deferred for consideration in the&#13;
follow-up project. This procedure ensured that the selection of sub-components&#13;
was made in a participatory manner and that the project is optimally sized, not&#13;
too large to be financially unsustainable by the WSCs and not too small to fall&#13;
short of essential targets.&#13;
C. Description&#13;
3.8         The project would include the following elements:  (a) renewal and&#13;
upgrading of water supply facilities in the urban districts of Hanoi, Haiphong&#13;

3.10        Institutional measures in WSCs would include:  (a) upgrading the&#13;
accounts receivable systems; (b) improving customer management (mapping,&#13;
registration, disconnections-reconnections, etc.); and (c) preparation of O&amp;M&#13;
guidelines for each WSC as a basis for establishing adequate budget allocations&#13;
which is an essential condition for upgrading of operation and maintenance&#13;
procedures to sustainable levels; (d) corporate planning models.&#13;
3.11        Support activities would include construction management and various&#13;
studies concerning (a) the quality of surface water sources, evaluating monitored&#13;
data, and identifying actions aimed at protecting the sources against pollution;&#13;
(b) identifying, quantifying, monitoring and evaluating NRW; (c) periodic audit&#13;
of the safety of Cao Van dam in Quang Ninh (para 3.33) and introducing corrective&#13;
actions, and (d) staff training and professional evaluation of managers and&#13;
operators in collaboration with international private water system operators.&#13;
TORs for institutional and support activities and various studies are listed in&#13;
Annex 13 (1-09, 2-09, 3-09, 4-16) and available in the project file.&#13;
3.12        The follow-up water supply investment and institutional development&#13;
program would expand water production and distribution capacity to meet system&#13;
demands beyond 2000 and position the WSCs for self-financing and private sector&#13;
participation. TORs for the engineering components should be completed by the&#13;
WSCs in March 1999. TORs for the institutional components would be formulated&#13;
following the mid-term review of the first water supply project.&#13;
D. Status of Preparation&#13;
3.13        The WSCs, assisted by consultants engaged under bilateral grants,&#13;
have completed preliminary or detailed engineering designs'; pre-qualification&#13;
and bidding documents for Hanoi, Haiphong and Quang Ninh were completed in April&#13;
1997 and for Danang will be completed in July 1997.   The designs follow&#13;
international standards for the water supply sector and have been technically&#13;
reviewed by Bank staff and found satisfactory. Pre-qualification and bidding&#13;
documents follow the Bank's standard documents.&#13;
1 Excluding details of distribution networks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
3.14        On the institutional side, technical assistance at the national level&#13;
for the MOC consisting of capacity building for project design and management,&#13;
preparation of design and construction guidelines and implementation of training&#13;
curricula carried out under a separate Australian assistance has been completed.&#13;
A pilot program to improve customer management has been started in Hanoi WBC by&#13;
Saur International (SI), a reputed private water system operator. Also, billing&#13;
and collection procedures in Hanoi WBC have been evaluated by an accounting firm,&#13;
Coopers and Lybrand. The firm was employed under a PHRD grant in January 1997 to&#13;
improve the procedures and the accounts receivable system in Haiphong.  As.a part&#13;
of institutional effort and commercialization of WSCs a workshop to be organized&#13;
by the EDI is planned for August 1997 to transfer the Bank's global experience&#13;
in performance agreements, public performance audits (para 4.21) and corporate&#13;
modeling to key policy and decision makers and related academics in Vietnam.&#13;
3.15        Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and environmental management&#13;
plans (EMPs) for the four cities were prepared as part of preliminary designs.&#13;
Resettlement action plans (RAPs) for Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang were&#13;
prepared as part of detailed designs before appraisal (para 3.27) . The EIAs for&#13;
the components were cleared and approved by the Ministry of Science, Technology,&#13;
and Environment (MOSTE) in August and October 1996. The EMPs were reviewed during&#13;
appraisal and are satisfactory.&#13;
E. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.16        The project cost is estimated at VND 1569.21 billion (US$142.66&#13;
million), with a foreign currency requirement estimated at VND 812.98 billion&#13;
(US$73.91 million) or 52% of the total.   Base costs reflect June 1996 price&#13;
levels. Physical contingencies are estimated at US$5.89 million or 5% of base&#13;
costs; price contingencies are at US$18.94 million, or about 16% of base costs&#13;
plus physical contingencies, and assume annual rates of inflation for local costs&#13;
of 7% for 1997, 6% for 1998-1999 and 5% for 2000-2004.   For foreign costs,&#13;
inflation is estimated at 2.3% from 1996 onwards. Cost estimates were based on&#13;
preliminary designs of the Quang Ninh and Danang components and completed&#13;
detailed designs of the Hanoi and Haiphong components.&#13;
3.17        The total cost of implementation support is estimated at US$15.85&#13;
million, which represents about 3,350 person-months, 2,250 of which would be for&#13;
supervision of construction and 1,100 for various studies and training.  The&#13;
input of national consultants is estimated at 2,700 person-months while&#13;
expatriate input is estimated at 650 person-months. Cost estimates are listed&#13;
in Annex 3 and summarized in Table 3.1.&#13;

F. Financing Plan&#13;
3.18        The proposed IDA credit would be funded under the Interim Trust Fund&#13;
(ITF) administered by IDA and subject to special provisions on procurement. The&#13;
credit of SDR 71.3 million (US$98.61 million equivalent) would finance 69% of&#13;
project costs net of duties and taxes. Finland would finance US$3.89 million for&#13;
studies, advisors and training in Hanoi and Haiphong, Denmark would finance&#13;
US$4.7 million for studies, advisors, training and construction supervision,&#13;
US$3.06 million for installation of individual connections2 and US$5.0 million&#13;
for construction of water supply facilities3 in Quang Ninh, and Australia would&#13;
finance US$1.33 million for studies,  advisors and training in Danang.   The&#13;
remaining US$26.07 million would be financed locally. The plan is summarized in&#13;
Table 3.2.&#13;
2 Danish grant to GOV would be administered by Denmark and onlent to Quang Ninh WSC for installing&#13;
water connections under the same terms as the IDA credit.&#13;

3.19        The borrower would be the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  The 40-year&#13;
ITF credit would include 10 years of grace at standard IDA terms. The ITF credit,&#13;
Danish grant to GOV and Danish Trust Fund for Quang Ninh would be onlent to water&#13;
companies by the Government in VND on the following terms: The fixed interest&#13;
rate would be 6.5% per annum, the loan would be repayable over 20 years with a&#13;
5 year grace period. The Government would bear the exchange rate risk, and&#13;
interest during the grace period would be waived. The onlending terms take into&#13;
account the fact that the WSCs need a subsidy at this initial stage of their&#13;
restructuring. The waiver of the interest during construction is a special&#13;
contribution of the Government to the WSCs. Separate project agreements have been&#13;
executed between IDA and the WSCs with covenants on operational, financial and&#13;
monitoring aspects.&#13;
3.20        At negotiations the onlending terms were confirmed and assurances&#13;
obtained from the Government that it would provide through PCs local funds as&#13;
required by WSCs for carrying out their parts of the project. The execution of&#13;
the Australian, Danish and Finnish Grant Agreements, and Danish Trust Fund would&#13;
be a condition of effectiveness of the ITF credit. Execution of subsidiary loan&#13;
agreements between the Government and the WSCs would be a condition of&#13;
disbursement of the ITF credit for the respective project component.&#13;
G. Implementation&#13;
3.21        The WSC in each province would employ contractors to supply equipment&#13;
and construct the proposed facilities. In Hanoi, Haiphong and Danang, they would&#13;
also hire engineering firms to act as the construction management consultants&#13;
(CMC), while in Quang Ninh, the CMC would be provided through Danish aid. The&#13;
CMCs would report to WSC directors and for daily activities, the directors would&#13;
delegate responsibility to the component coordinators, who would head the&#13;
component implementation units (CIUs) within the WSCs. Together, the WSCs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
provincial governments have established component implementation committees&#13;
(CICs) to help the WSCs implement the works by facilitating administrative&#13;
actions. The CMCs would also serve as secretariats to the CICs and report on&#13;
implementation progress at regular meetings (see Chart 1).&#13;
3.22        Construction is expected to start in October 1997 and be completed&#13;
by June 2002 (para. 3.41) . Project works are expected to be operating in all WSCs&#13;
by the end of 2001, but the installation of water connections and other minor&#13;
works may extend for an additional six months.   The schedule  (Annex 4) is&#13;
considered realistic since each component involves just one contract for both&#13;
civil works and the supply and installation of goods. Supervision would be aided&#13;
by firms of consultants. Employment of construction management consultants&#13;
acceptable to IDA would be a condition of disbursement for the related part of&#13;
the project.&#13;
3.23        Institutional and other studies and training would be financed by&#13;
Finnish, Danish and Australian grants that would be provided to Vietnam under&#13;
bilateral agreements. The program of implementation support, training and outline&#13;
TOR for studies agreed upon with co-financing agencies are available in the&#13;
project file. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that beginning in 1997&#13;
WSCs would submit annual plans for implementation support and training to IDA&#13;
each year by October 30.&#13;
3.24        The WSCs have prepared project implementation plans that define the&#13;
scope and timing of actions needed to carry out the project. An understanding was&#13;
reached at negotiations that each WSC would carry out its project implementation&#13;
plan. The plans are available in the project file and summarized in Annex 5.&#13;
H. Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
3.25        Water production facilities and transmission mains would require&#13;
acquisition of about 45 ha of land, of which 9 ha would be for temporary use and&#13;
36 ha for permanent use, involving in total 1,772 households. The Hanoi and&#13;
Haiphong components would not involve relocation of affected persons. In Hanoi,&#13;
12 ha would need to be acquired for permanent and 3 ha for temporary use&#13;
involving in total 1,362 households. In Haiphong, 1.5 ha would need to be&#13;
acquired for permanent use involving 44 households. The Quang Ninh component&#13;
would require 8 ha of land, of which 4 ha would be for temporary use, and 4 ha&#13;
for permanent use. Of 465 various structures located on top of water mains, some&#13;
would be demolished or relocated to ensure the pipelines are safe and to protect&#13;
water quality. This would involve 212 households in total. The Danang component&#13;
would require 20 ha of land of which 2 ha would be for temporary use, and 18 ha&#13;
for permanent use. About 13 structures would be partly demolished and remodelled&#13;
on their plots. Land acquisition would involve 154 households of which 13 would&#13;
have structures affected.&#13;
3.26        Collection of data on distribution pipelines prior to appraisal was&#13;
not feasible since their exact location will be known only at implementation.&#13;
Thus, in respect of distribution components, RAPs with data on specific&#13;
resettlement activities would be completed when all the information on the land&#13;
to be acquired and its owners are available, and submitted to IDA for approval&#13;
prior to start of works. All distribution pipelines would be under public roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
It is estimated that approximately 150 ha of land would need to be acquired for&#13;
temporary use. The policy framework for these (distribution) RAPs would be the&#13;
same as outlined in the RAPs for transmission components (paras 3.27 and 3.28).&#13;
3.27        Following  OD 4.30  on  Involuntary Resettlement,  WSCs  submitted&#13;
satisfactory resettlement action plans (RAPs) which include a policy framework,&#13;
detailed Action Plans for the production and transmission components of the&#13;
project and provision for preparing Action Plans for the distribution components.&#13;
The RAPs were approved by the respective PCs and by the Government of Vietnam.&#13;
The Prime Minister's approval includes special decisions releasing the&#13;
enforcement of Vietnamese regulations related to replacement rates for valuation&#13;
of assets and to non-compensation to unauthorized settlers on acquired land.&#13;
3.28        Implementation of detailed RAPs would be regularly supervised and&#13;
monitored by WSCs and reported to the respective Component Implementation&#13;
Committee and PC. The status would also be included in semi-annual progress&#13;
reports submitted to IDA. In addition, an external agency, acceptable to IDA,&#13;
would be employed by WSCs to semi-annually carry out monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of RAP implementation and to prepare a final report on completion of each RAP.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the WSCs would implement their&#13;
respective RAPs and would arrange for: (i) semiannual progress reports on WSCs'&#13;
supervision and monitoring of resettlement activities; (b) starting from December&#13;
31, 1997, an independent semi-annual monitoring of RAPs' implementation; and&#13;
(iii) final report on completion of each RAP. IDA approval of a detailed&#13;
(distribution) RAP in respect of each distribution network site would be required&#13;
prior to commencement of works on that part of the project. These would be&#13;
prepared by WSCs and approved by PCs. The establishment of Resettlement&#13;
Committees by each of the PCs pursuant to the provisions of the RAPs would be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness of the ITF credit.&#13;
3.29        The Quang Ninh component would draw water from the reservoir created&#13;
by the Cao Van dam. The filling of the reservoir in 1996 involved the&#13;
resettlement of 117 families  (688 individuals)  belonging to the Do ethnic&#13;
minority. The Government started the resettlement in early 1992 by meeting with&#13;
affected households and by December 1996 the resettlement was completed. The&#13;
households selected the areas where they wanted to settle: 69 households&#13;
resettled in Gia Lai province in the Central Highlands while 48 households&#13;
resettled within Quang Ninh province. In addition to provision of land for land,&#13;
compensation at replacement rates was paid for houses, trees, crops and other&#13;
assets lost, along with transport to the new area. Civic infrastructure, such&#13;
as roads and schools, was provided in the new areas.&#13;
3.30        A resettlement specialist on indigenous people reviewed the program's&#13;
status in October 1996. He concluded that: (a) the Cao Van construction planning&#13;
and design included resettlement costs; (b) its organization followed government&#13;
guidelines and decisions, with budgetary allocations and funds disbursed&#13;
annually; (c) the affected population was recognized as a special ethnic group;&#13;
(d) resettlement locations were chosen by the project affected people (PAP) and&#13;
the move was implemented in several phases, accommodating expressed preferences&#13;
and customs; and (e) the resettled households have legal access to productive&#13;
resources that allow for sustainable, but relatively intensified annual cropping&#13;
patterns. The report is available in the project file. In March 1997, a field&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
visit was made to Gia Lai province where 69 affected households have relocated.&#13;
A number of issues pertaining to this resettlement are considered outstanding.&#13;
These include completion of facilities for and asset transfer to households&#13;
resettled in Gia Lai province (5.3 ha of land, electrical connections to 25&#13;
families and dry season irrigation facility) and information on living standards&#13;
of 12 families who self-relocated in Quang Ninh province. Necessary actions&#13;
pertaining to these were agreed at negotiations and covenanted in the Project&#13;
Agreement. Compliance with the obligation to provide the assets (land and&#13;
electrical connections) to households resettled in Gia Lai province would be a&#13;
condition of disbursement of the proceeds of the credit earmarked to finance all&#13;
of Quang Ninh WSC project components. A dated covenant, June 30, 1998, was&#13;
included in the Project Agreement with regard to completion of the irrigation&#13;
facility in Gia Lai province.&#13;
I. Safety of Cao Van dam&#13;
3.31        The Cao Van dam was designed,  constructed and financed by the&#13;
Government. The dam is an earthfill structure 28 m high and 225 m long creating&#13;
a reservoir with a water volume of about 11 million m3. Construction of the dam&#13;
started in 1992 and was essentially completed in early 1996. Minor works such as&#13;
clearing, planting of grass and some reforestation will extend to 1997. The&#13;
purpose of the reservoir is to immediately provide about 60,000 m3/d of raw water&#13;
for Halong water supply system which will be increased to 120,000 m3/d after the&#13;
dam is raised in about 2010.&#13;
3.32        On IDA request the Quang Ninh WSC, assisted by Danish aid, arranged&#13;
in 1995 for an independent dam specialist4 to (a) inspect and evaluate the&#13;
safety status of the Cao Van dam, and (b) provide recommendations on any safety-&#13;
related remedial measures5. In his finding, the specialist stated that the&#13;
construction was carried out to a good standard and no safety problems should&#13;
occur when the dam is completed and recommended that the design flood and the&#13;
hydraulic design of the spillway be further studied. In addition, the report&#13;
suggested that (a) routine safety inspections of the dam should be carried out&#13;
by the safety engineer of Quang Ninh WSC twice a year, and (b) independent safety&#13;
inspections by an independent specialist be carried out annually. The inspection&#13;
report is available in the project file.&#13;
3.33        The Quang Ninh  WSC  has  agreed  to  implement  the  specialist's&#13;
recommendations and the Danish aid program includes the carrying out of the&#13;
recommended studies and assistance with periodical safety inspections (para&#13;
3.11) . TOR for the studies are available in the project file. At negotiations&#13;
assurances were obtained that the Quang Ninh WSC would furnish by December 31,&#13;
1997 proposed arrangements for periodic inspections of the Cao Van dam and that&#13;
it would implement recommendations of such inspections thereafter.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

J. Procurement&#13;
3.34        Procurement would be carried out according to the Guidelines for IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995, revised in January and August 1996 6.&#13;
The four major supply and installation contracts that comprise the bulk of&#13;
procurement (US$111.33 million) would involve supplying and installing mechanical&#13;
and electrical equipment. These contracts would be procured through international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB) following the pre-qualification of bidders and using&#13;
the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs), Standard Pre-qualification Document&#13;
and Standard Bid Evaluation Form. ICB procedures and SBDs would also be used to&#13;
procure most of the vehicles and equipment (US$2.09 million) . Small equipment for&#13;
maintaining the network, workshops and laboratories, and office equipment&#13;
packaged in individual contracts that do not exceed US$100, 000 each or US$890, 000&#13;
altogether, would be procured by shopping7. These would consist of small value&#13;
contracts awarded by the four WSCs. For procurement under ICB procedures,&#13;
domestic goods, plant and equipment would be allowed a preference margin of 15%&#13;
or the amount of customs duties, whichever is lower, for bid evaluation. A&#13;
general procurement notice was published on March 31, 1996. In addition, specific&#13;
procurement notices will be advertised for all contracts exceeding $10 million&#13;
for goods and works and $200,000 for consultants. No mandatory associations&#13;
between foreign and local consultants will be permitted. Further general&#13;
procurement notices will be issued for outstanding project components including&#13;
expected consultancy assignments. Prequalification notices were published in&#13;
Development Business. Procurement arrangements are detailed in Annex 4 and&#13;
summarized in Table 3.3.&#13;
6 Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph 1.6 of the Guidelines, the proceeds of the Interim Fund Credit&#13;
may only be withdrawn on account of expenditures for goods, works and services provided by nationals of, and&#13;
produced in or supplied from ITF Participating Countries.&#13;
7 For international shopping, a minimum of three quotations from at least two countries will be solicited.&#13;
For national shopping, three quotations will be obtained from qualified suppliers. Requests for quotations will also&#13;
indicate the specifications, quantity and time-frame for delivery.&#13;

3.35        Construction management consultants for Hanoi and Haiphong were&#13;
short-listed and the Letter of Invitation was approved by the Bank before March&#13;
1, 1997 in accordance with Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981) . Those for&#13;
Danang would be short-listed in accordance with the revised Guidelines for&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997)8.&#13;
Consultants would be selected following the Quality- and Cost-Based Selection&#13;
(QCBS) method and use the Standard Contract for Consultants' Services produced&#13;
in June 1995. The construction management consultant for Quang Ninh financed by&#13;
Danida has been employed on basis of terms of reference and qualifications&#13;
satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
3.36        IDA's prior review would be mandatory for all supply and install&#13;
contracts and those for equipment and materials of more than US$100,000. This&#13;
would cover about 90% of the value of the goods contracts and 100% of the supply&#13;
and install contracts. All other contracts would be subject to IDA's post review&#13;
procedures on the basis of a sufficient number of transactions selected randomly&#13;
8 Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph 1.02 of the Guidelines, only consultants from Participating&#13;
Countries shall be eligible to provide services financed out the proceeds of the Interim Fund Credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
to achieve a sampling ratio of 1 in 10. All contracts with consulting firms,&#13;
except for those of under US$100,000 (for selection under QCBS), or for&#13;
individuals  estimated  to  cost  less  than  US$50,000  (for  selection  under&#13;
Consultants' Qualifications), would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures&#13;
for review of the terms of reference, estimates and criteria for short-listing.&#13;
Notwithstanding the above, IDA's prior review procedures for consultant services&#13;
apply to terms of reference, sole source selection and assignments of critical&#13;
nature.&#13;
K. Disbursement&#13;
3.37        The proceeds of the ITF credit and Danish fund would be disbursed&#13;
against: (a) 85t of total expenditures of supply and installation contracts; (b)&#13;
100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and materials; (c) 100% of&#13;
local expenditures (ex-factory) for domestically manufactured equipment and&#13;
materials, or 65% of local expenditures for other equipment and materials&#13;
procured locally and (d) 100% of total expenditures for consultant services.&#13;
3.38        Disbursement for equipment and material contracts of US$100,000 or&#13;
less, for services provided by consulting firms under contrcts of US$100,000 or&#13;
less, and for services provided by individual consultants under contracts of&#13;
US$50,000 or less would be made on the basis of a statement of expenditures&#13;
(SOE). Supporting documents for these expenditures would be retained by the&#13;
Government, made available for review by IDA supervision missions, and regularly&#13;
validated by independent auditors (para 5.10). To facilitate disbursements from&#13;
the credit, the WSCs may each open and maintain an ITF special deposit account&#13;
(Account) in a commercial bank authorized for this purpose, on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA, including appropriate protection against set-off,&#13;
seizure or attachment.&#13;
3.39        Each of the Accounts would have an authorized allocation of US$1.0&#13;
million to be withdrawn from the credit account and deposited in the Account,&#13;
provided, however, that authorized allocation shall be limited to an amount&#13;
equivalent to US$500,000 until disbursement and outstanding commitments against&#13;
the credit allocated to each component equal or exceed the equivalent of SDR&#13;
700,000, unless IDA would otherwise agree. Applications to replenish the Account,&#13;
supported by documentation, would be submitted regularly (not less than&#13;
quarterly) or when the amount withdrawn equaled 30% of the initial deposit.&#13;
3.40        Full disbursement of the proceeds of the Danish Trust Fund will be&#13;
a condition of disbursement of the ITF credit earmarked for the respective&#13;
project component in Quang Ninh Province.&#13;
3.41        Project implementation would extend over four and a half years.&#13;
Project works are expected to be operating in all WSCs by the end of 2001, but&#13;
the installation of water connections and other minor works may extend for&#13;
additional six months, to June 30, 2002. The loan closing date would be December&#13;
31, 2002. The estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 6) is based on the detailed&#13;
project implementation schedule which reflects simplified implementation through&#13;
one supply-and-install contract in each project component and advanced&#13;
procurement with completed pre-qualification at the time of Board presentation.&#13;
As there is no Bank disbursement profile available for water supply projects in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
Vietnam, the comparison shows the Bank Standard Disbursement Profile (1995) for&#13;
water supply and sanitation projects in the East Asia and Pacific Region.&#13;
L. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.42         Implementation of the project would be beneficial for the living&#13;
standards and health conditions of the local population. Rehabilitation of the&#13;
existing facilities would reduce NRW while the expansion of treatment plants and&#13;
transmission and distribution lines would improve the quality and volume of&#13;
water, enhance service levels and raise revenues.&#13;
3.43        Negative impacts would include the acquisition of cultivated land,&#13;
demolition of structures and inconvenience for the residents during construction.&#13;
To mitigate these effects, the project would include environmental monitoring,&#13;
which would continue during implementation.   Land compensation would be paid&#13;
according to the RAPs. Other compensations would be made to government agencies&#13;
(where their property is affected) during the construction of water mains and&#13;
distribution networks.&#13;
3.44        Temporary  and  manageable  impacts  during  site  clearing  and&#13;
construction of the facilities would include increased levels of traffic, dust,&#13;
and noise; disruption of water supply; blocked drainage and water pollution due&#13;
to soil erosion at excavation sites; and disposal of surplus soil and&#13;
construction materials. The impacts on residential areas would be minor since&#13;
most of the WTPs, intakes, and other facilities would be situated away from&#13;
residential areas. The mountainous area in Quang Ninh where the raw water main&#13;
would be laid and the hill in Danang where the WTP would be constructed are&#13;
degraded areas and serious impacts on the local ecology are not expected.&#13;
3.45        In close consultation with the residents, the pipeline would be laid&#13;
along road shoulders where the impacts on households and businesses would be&#13;
minimal. During the design phase of the water mains and distribution pipelines,&#13;
efforts were made to minimize the impacts on burial grounds, houses, and&#13;
buildings, the need to obtain land and to excavate large quantities of soil.&#13;
3.46        The contractors would be required to carry out the planning and&#13;
construction according to contractual environmental specifications, including (a)&#13;
consultations with residents, (b) provision of safe temporary paths for residents&#13;
and businesses, (c) safety measures for the public and workers, (d) measures to&#13;
reduce erosion, dust, and noise levels due to construction, (e) limited transport&#13;
and construction along the main roads in urban areas during rush hours and in&#13;
residential  areas at night,  (f)  appropriate  disposal  of surplus  soil and&#13;
construction materials, and (g) provision of adequate water by alternate means&#13;
when piped water is interrupted.&#13;
3.47        Once operating, the WTPs would generate treatment sludge which would&#13;
be disposed of in retention lagoons in WTPs and, when dried, would be disposed&#13;
of in controlled landfills. Significant net increase of water supply is not&#13;
anticipated in the first project. The increased system capacity would displace&#13;
water from alternative sources being used by residents not presently served by&#13;
the piped system. Significant capacity expansion is planned for the second water&#13;
supply project. By that time, the first sanitation project currently being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
prepared in the four cities (para 3.4) would have been implemented.&#13;
3.48        Potential impacts on land subsidence in Hanoi, dam safety in Quang&#13;
Ninh, salinity intrusion in Danang, and contamination of water quality at the&#13;
intakes and in the water supply systems in all project components have been&#13;
identified and will be addressed by the project's implementation support. These&#13;
include (a) monitoring of groundwater and land subsidence in Hanoi; (b) programs&#13;
to protect water resources and quality for each project component; (c) a safety&#13;
program at the Cao Van dam and (d) a program to ensure availability of water&#13;
resources in Danang.   TORs for these studies are in the project file and a&#13;
detailed description of the environmental impact including involuntary&#13;
resettlement is presented in Annex 7.&#13;
3.49        WSCs are willing to implement the project with due attention to&#13;
protection of environment through mitigating actions specified in the EMPs (para&#13;
3.15) and to comply with all the requirements issued by MOSTE within EIA&#13;
clearances. Compliance would be monitored by WSCs with the help of consultants&#13;
and periodically by the DOSTE in each province. For their part, residents would&#13;
participate throughout various stages of the planning and implementation of the&#13;
EMPs and the RAPs. Each household would be fully informed by the WSC, district&#13;
and communal peoples, committees.   The public relations program would be&#13;
continuous. At negotiations, WSCs confirmed that they would implement mitigating&#13;
actions specified in their individual EMPs.&#13;
M. Supervision and Performance Indicators&#13;
3.50        IDA's project supervision would require about 79 staff-weeks over the&#13;
life of the project, of which 20 staff-weeks would be at headquarters to review&#13;
progress reports, procurement actions and correspondence, 34 staff-weeks would&#13;
be in the field and 25 staff-weeks would be at the Bank's Resident Mission in&#13;
Vietnam (RMV) . Supervision by headquarters staff (sanitary engineers, financial&#13;
analysts and specialists in environmental issues) would focus on institutional&#13;
and physical progress while the involvement of RMV staff would center on&#13;
coordinating the project's four components. The borrower's contribution to&#13;
supervision would entail coordination of IDA visits and reports on various&#13;
subjects, such as regular reporting on implementation progress, evaluation&#13;
reports on project implementation, including plans for future operations of&#13;
respective components of the project.&#13;
3.51        Due to absence of a coordinating agency from early stages of project&#13;
preparation, the four WSCs started mutual consultations among themselves and, due&#13;
to advantageous location, the Hanoi WBC gradually assumed many of the&#13;
coordinating tasks. The WSCs therefore agreed that the Hanoi WBC would be&#13;
responsible for overall coordination of the project's four components. This would&#13;
include communications with the Government, administrative duties in connection&#13;
with visits of IDA missions in Vietnam, ensuring timely reporting on progress of&#13;
project components, etc. Managing the continuation of on-going consultations&#13;
among the WSCs on various technical and financial aspects related to project&#13;
implementation company management would be an important function. To facilitate&#13;
and expedite communication with IDA, which involves two languages, the Hanoi WBC&#13;
would be assisted by a sanitary engineer experienced in Bank procedures and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
located in the RMV9. An understanding was reached at negotiations that overall&#13;
coordination of the project would be the responsibility of Hanoi WBC. A project&#13;
supervision plan is presented in Annex 8.&#13;
3.52        In addition  to input and output  indicators  used  for project&#13;
supervision, annual Performance Agreements between the Provincial Governments and&#13;
the WSCs linked to staff compensation are proposed to be used for evaluating WSC&#13;
performance and to strengthen management incentives. Also, Public Performance&#13;
Audits are proposed to be used to make comparative WSC performance information&#13;
available to the public to make consumer voice and benchmarking competition an&#13;
effective tool for improving performance. Impact, input and output indicators are&#13;
shown in Annex 11 (Table A 11.1). Based on the Performance/Risk Summary (Table&#13;
A 11.2), key performance indicators relevant for the project implementation phase&#13;
were identified (para 5.41) . These are presented in Table A 11.3 and were&#13;
confirmed at negotiations along with the contents of the Borrower's reports, as&#13;
outlined in Annex 8. A mid-term review of the project focusing primarily on the&#13;
institutional components would take place in June 1999.&#13;
9 The National Country Officer in Vietnam of the UNDP/WB Water and Sanitation Program is available&#13;
to provide part-time assistance for project coordination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
IV. THE INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Sector Structure&#13;
4.1         The Ministry of Construction  (MOC)  is the main national agency&#13;
responsible for water supply and sanitation. Through its departments and&#13;
enterprises, the MOC prepares national plans for the sector, regulates various&#13;
technical aspects of water and sanitation facilities, approves designs of major&#13;
projects, and assists in the implementation of water supply and sanitation&#13;
projects. In addition, it has wide responsibilities in areas of construction,&#13;
construction supervision and investment.&#13;
4.2         As part of decentralization, the responsibility for operating public&#13;
utilities, including water supply, was assigned to provinces with elimination of&#13;
MOC's direct involvement. PCs created Water Supply Companies (WSCs) as legal&#13;
entities1 to be responsible for construction, operation and maintenance of urban&#13;
water supply. The PCs have considerable influence on WSCs development policies,&#13;
including increased market orientation, setting targets for production and&#13;
distribution of water, deciding on WSCs financial policies, including the blend&#13;
of tariffs and subsidies. The organization structure of a typical Provincial&#13;
Government is shown in Chart 2. At negotiations assurances were obtained that the&#13;
Government would cause the PCs to take all actions to enable the respective WSCs&#13;
to implement the project and comply with their obligations.&#13;
4.3         Water supply services in the project cities are managed and operated&#13;
by WSCs which report to the respective PCs. The organization structure of a&#13;
typical WSC is shown in Chart 3.&#13;
4.4         The optimal sector structure for provision of urban water supply&#13;
services in Vietnam has been evaluated under an ADB financed technical&#13;
assistance. A number of alternatives including a national water supply company&#13;
and municipal companies were assessed but the existing structure based on&#13;
provincial WSCs was considered to offer the best potential for sector&#13;
development. The appraisal mission concurs with this recommendation. The sector&#13;
structure for provision of sewerage and sanitatiLon services would be reviewed in&#13;
detail as part of the preparation of the sanitation project.&#13;
B. Project Implementation&#13;
4.5         The project would be implemented in each province by the provincial&#13;
water company: the Hanoi Water Business Company (WBC), the Haiphong Water Supply&#13;
Company, the Quang Ninh Water Supply Company and the Danang Water Supply Company.&#13;
To aid implementation the WSCs have established Component Implementation&#13;
Committees (CICs) with the participation of the provincial PC. CICs are headed&#13;
by the Deputy Director of the Transport and Urban Public Works Service (TUPWS)&#13;
of the PC responsible for water supply in Hanoi, Haiphong and Danang and by the&#13;
Director of the Construction Department (CD) of the PC in Quang Ninh. CICs,&#13;
1 Details of establishing WSCs as legal entities with separate legal personality are included in the project's&#13;
legal documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
supported by CMCs (para 3.21), would help the WSCs implement the works by&#13;
facilitating processing of various administrative actions within the PC including&#13;
budgetary planning and financial support. The CIC of each component would also&#13;
help the WSC evaluate various institutional and other studies, assist in&#13;
implementing proposed institutional improvements within the WSCIs organization,&#13;
and advise on content of annual plans for implementation support and training&#13;
activities to be provided through Finnish, Danish and Australian technical&#13;
assistance (para 3.23) . The implementing arrangements are shown schematically in&#13;
Chart 1. An understanding was reached at negotiations that the CIC would be&#13;
maintained for the duration of the project.&#13;
C. Staffing and Training&#13;
4.6         In 1995, the number of employees was 1,720 in Hanoi, 627 in Haiphong,&#13;
476 in Quang Ninh and 274 in Danang. Employees per 1,000 connections varied from&#13;
about 11 in Haiphong and Danang to 14 in Hanoi and 35 in Quang Ninh. Primarily&#13;
due to the projected rise in the number of connections, the ratio is expected to&#13;
stabilize below 10 by 2000 in all four cities which is acceptable and within&#13;
parameters of major Asian cities2.&#13;
4.7         Staff salaries conform to the general scales set by the Ministry of&#13;
Labor, but bonuses are also paid for achieving certain financial targets; thus,&#13;
income levels are affected by company performance. For example, since Hanoi 's WBC&#13;
has operated at a loss in recent years, salaries have been considerably lower&#13;
than in Danang and Haiphong, and top-quality employees have been hard to retain.&#13;
Those that stay often have to find additional work to meet their family needs.&#13;
4.8         Training levels also vary among the four companies, mainly due to the&#13;
resources available and management interest. In Hanoi and Haiphong, training has&#13;
been supported by the on-going Finnish Program. During this time, 188 staff from&#13;
the Hanoi WBC participated in overseas training or study tours, although some&#13;
left the company later, and in Haiphong, 17 staff participated in overseas study&#13;
tours. In September 1995, Haiphong WSC entered into a twinning-training agreement&#13;
with the water company in Turku, Finland and the Asian Institute of Technology&#13;
will train 11 Hanoi WBCs managers during 1996. In Quang Ninh and Danang,&#13;
resources have not been available for management training.&#13;
4.9         All  four WSCs  companies  recruit  technicians  such  as  welders,&#13;
electricians and plumbers who are formally trained in national or provincial&#13;
vocational schools. However, those working specifically in water trades (such&#13;
as pump operators, pipe fitters and meter readers, etc.) are trained in-house.&#13;
The training is provided by company engineers and technicians using course&#13;
material prepared by the company and normally results in examinations and&#13;
improved salary grades of trainees. However, a shortage of funds for training,&#13;
lack of training aids such as equipment and tools, as well as standard curricula&#13;
and evaluation methods adversely affects the quality and output of training.&#13;
4.10        The analysis of training needs to meet the long-term manpower&#13;
2 Water Utilities Data Book, Asian and Pacific Region; ADB, November 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
requirements of the sector has not yet been made, mainly due to the perceived&#13;
view in the Government that decentralization of the training to WSCs is the&#13;
correct approach and that the training of operating staff without providing means&#13;
for physical improvement of degraded facilities has low value. While the idea has&#13;
some merit, it is recognized that a study of human resource development for the&#13;
sector, including policies to resolve various related issues such as national&#13;
licensing of sector trade categories, salary scales, performance incentives, etc.&#13;
should be initiated in the near future.&#13;
4.11        Experience suggests that the lead time required for carrying out such&#13;
a study would exceed the time required to bring the physical components of the&#13;
project on line. Project-related training, therefore, to upgrade skills of most&#13;
critical trade categories in shortest time was found the most feasible solution&#13;
at this time. Greater regional exposure for managers and specialized training in&#13;
commercially oriented systems is also proposed. Along these lines a training&#13;
needs assessment has been completed for all WSCs and a training proposal has&#13;
being prepared in collaboration with the private water operator Saur&#13;
International (SI) (para 3.14).&#13;
D. Institutional Issues&#13;
4.12        Key institutional issues pertain to facilitating the transition of&#13;
the WSCs from subsidized entities operating in a planned environment and&#13;
providing a minimum level of social service to commercial companies in a market&#13;
economy accountable to owners and consumers and self-financing operations and&#13;
capital expansion through user charges. Although, as part of the State Enterprise&#13;
Reform, the WSCs are expected to recover all operating and maintenance&#13;
expenditures by 2000 and contribute to capital expenditures subsequently, the&#13;
organizational structure, operating rules and management style required to&#13;
support these changes have been slow to evolve. Thus, the WSCs are quite some&#13;
distance from their goals of financial independence and customer orientation.&#13;
However, the commitment of the provincial PCs and the motivation of the WSC&#13;
management to be ready for the transition to the market economy leaves no doubt&#13;
that the changes are achievable.&#13;
4.13        The principal  changes needed by the WSCs  relate  to increased&#13;
operational autonomy, customer orientation, commercial procedures, financial&#13;
planning and the institutionalization of accountability and performance enhancing&#13;
incentive systems. Implementation of the changes is modulated by the very real&#13;
and immediate need to increase revenues quickly. Increased revenues are required&#13;
to appropriately fund operations and maintenance, compensate staff adequately and&#13;
service the debt for capital expenditures. Increased revenues are also needed to&#13;
eliminate subsidies and gradually transform the WSCs into entities operating on&#13;
commercial basis.&#13;
4.14        In 1995, the Hanoi PC made a credible commitment to reducing NRW by&#13;
entering into a technical assistance contract with SI to implement a customer&#13;
management program in one district of Hanoi. The first phase of the contract&#13;
would be completed in March 1997. A connections survey and inventory of 4328&#13;
customers was completed in September 1996. The survey showed that of the 4328&#13;
customers, 845 were unidentified in the WSC records, 114 were illegal, and 632&#13;
were not receiving any water. This survey indicates the potential for increasing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
revenues through commercial customer management.&#13;
4.15        A decentralized management model based on fully metered zones&#13;
operated with community participation is being progressively implemented in&#13;
Haiphong since 1995 with good results. NRW in the improved zones has fallen from&#13;
over 60% to below 40%. The entire system will be converted to the new model under&#13;
the IDA financed project. The Hanoi WBC has agreed on a NRW reduction program&#13;
with the Hanoi PC and is implementing it using a similar approach. Comparable&#13;
results have been reported in the pilot zones.&#13;
4.16        In parallel to the above, accounting consultants Coopers and Lybrand&#13;
conducted an evaluation of the billing and collection procedures and accounts&#13;
receivable system of the Hanoi WBC in 1995 and made recommendations for&#13;
improvement. Based on the study, a Japanese Grant has been obtained for the&#13;
Haiphong WSC to improve billing and collection procedures and the account&#13;
receivables system. Coopers and Lybrand was selected for the Haiphong contract&#13;
and commenced work in January 1997. Similar work would be initiated in Quang Ninh&#13;
and Danang with bilateral assistance. Once the accounting systems are&#13;
computerized and fully converted to the new national accounting standards,&#13;
corporate planning and financial models are proposed to be introduced to&#13;
facilitate planning for capital investment programs.&#13;
4.17        In Hanoi and Haiphong, pilot NRW detection and evaluation programs&#13;
are included in the technical assistance. Based on the asset inventory and&#13;
revaluation completed by all WSCs at the end of 1995, operation and maintenance&#13;
guidelines based on standard engineering codes of practice are to be prepared to&#13;
ensure appropriate budget allocations for the purpose.&#13;
4.18        The above initiatives designed to generate the surplus required to&#13;
underpin the sustainability of the physical investments would be complemented by&#13;
training needed to manage, operate and maintain the facilities effectively in a&#13;
market economy. A training needs assessment has been completed for each WSC and&#13;
a proposal for a pilot training and evaluation program for the Hanoi WBC has been&#13;
prepared in collaboration with SI. It is proposed that based on the evaluation&#13;
of the pilot program, the training center in Hanoi be raised to the level of a&#13;
national center for training of staff from other WSCs. Training needs of the WSCs&#13;
would be identified and evaluated on an annual basis and financed from bilateral&#13;
assistance.&#13;
4.19        Measures to increase WSC operational autonomy while making the&#13;
companies more accountable to the PCs would be based on the introduction of&#13;
annual performance agreements between the PCs and the WSCs. Such agreements have&#13;
been introduced in Thailand with Bank assistance as part of public sector reform.&#13;
Given the natural monopoly in water distribution and the fact that significant&#13;
private sector involvement is not yet possible, this constitutes a feasible&#13;
option to improve public sector performance. At present, embryonic agreements&#13;
related to reduction of NRW exist in Hanoi and a few other WSCs.&#13;
4.20        The introduction of other targets in performance agreements between&#13;
the PCs and WSCs would integrate project monitoring and evaluation into the&#13;
management incentive system in a dynamic fashion. While it is recognized that the&#13;
monetary rewards in terms of bonus payments resulting from such a system may not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
initially compare favorably to other sources of additional income, the system&#13;
would allow the WSCs' performance to be compared on a common basis providing&#13;
strong psychological motivation for management to improve company performance.&#13;
However, the introduction is intended to be selective, based on a judgement of&#13;
when such arrangements would yield positive results without becoming&#13;
bureaucratized.&#13;
4.21        Management incentives to improve performance via consumer involvement&#13;
are proposed to be institutionalized through the introduction of public&#13;
performance audits (PPAs) of the WSCs by an independent agency. Public disclosure&#13;
of comparative information relevant for users would enable consumer voice and&#13;
benchmarking competition to be used as effective tools in improving WSC&#13;
performance. PPAs are being introduced in the Philippines with Bank assistance.&#13;
4.22        Given the decision to reduce sectoral coordination at the national&#13;
government level, the Association of Water Supply Companies (AWSC) is currently&#13;
being strengthened to share experiences and best practices among the WSCs. For&#13;
example, the Danang WSC management has succeeded in universal metering and in&#13;
getting NRW down to 33% while the Haiphong WSC has implemented a system of&#13;
community involvement in managing water at the neighborhood level which has&#13;
decreased NRW from over 60% to below 40% in rehabilitated wards. This lends&#13;
confidence to the expectation that the potential exists to reduce NRW quickly and&#13;
relatively inexpensively in all WSCs. A workshop on commercial management of&#13;
water supply companies in a market economy has been requested by the AWSC and is&#13;
planned for August 1997 in collaboration with EDI.&#13;
4.23        Sector dialogue with the Government is continuing on gradual private&#13;
sector participation in the operations of the WSCs. Evaluation of the experience&#13;
gained during the implementation of the contract between Hanoi WBC and SI and BOT&#13;
schemes for bulk water provision would be used to propose suitable modifications&#13;
and extensions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Rate Structure&#13;
5.1         Country-wide   water   tariffs   for   residential   customers,   state&#13;
organizations and businesses were maintained up to 1986 at the nominal rate of 1&#13;
VND/m3. Since then, they have been increased significantly in real terms, following&#13;
the Government's decision to charge users instead of covering all costs through&#13;
general taxes'.   In the early 1990s, the tasks of supplying water and setting&#13;
tariffs were decentralized, and provincial WSCs were created that were expected to&#13;
progressively become financially self-sufficient. Since then, the WSCs have&#13;
submitted every year tariff proposals, including an analysis of customer&#13;
affordability, to the PCs for approval. Currently, most customers are charged on&#13;
the basis of metered consumption; non-metered residential customers are charged on&#13;
assumed monthly consumption (usually 4 m3 per capita) and industrial-commercial&#13;
customers through negotiated contracts.&#13;
5.2         From 1990-1995, tariffs in the project cities have increased unevenly.&#13;
The average tariff in Quang Ninh is the highest, VND 1,800/m3 in 1995, compared to&#13;
VND 1,420/m3 in Hanoi, VND 1,150/m3 in Haiphong and VND 838/m3 in Danang.&#13;
Typically, domestic consumers pay 20% less than the average charge per m3, while&#13;
commercial consumers pay about 45% above the average.   Each city has several&#13;
categories (domestic, commercial and tourist facilities), with separate rates. In&#13;
Hanoi and Danang, tariffs include a 10% surcharge for sewerage. About 1,000 public&#13;
taps operate in Hanoi, and 650 in Haiphong. These provide free water in low-income&#13;
areas, but will be gradually phased out. All four WSCs have received approvals from&#13;
respective PCs for increased tariffs in 1996 at or above the rate used in the&#13;
financial projections (projections use 1995 as the base year as it is the last full&#13;
year for which complete accounts are available) for the IDA financed project.&#13;
5.3         A national water tariff policy study financed by the ADB was completed&#13;
in March 1996 and its recommendations are presently being reviewed by the&#13;
Government. The appraisal mission is in agreement with these recommendations which&#13;
also address issues of consumer protection and universal access. They include a&#13;
minimum monthly charge (covering 5 m3 for domestic and 10 m3 for non-domestic&#13;
customers), a lifeline block2 (varying between 12 and 20 m3/month depending on city&#13;
size set at a minimum of 1,500 VND/m3), a progressive tariff with three tariff&#13;
bands, and a separate tariff for industrial and commercial customers. The&#13;
recommendations also include universal metering, amortization of connection costs&#13;
through the monthly tariff and groundwater licensing. At negotiations assurances&#13;
were obtained from the Government that necessary actions would be taken through PCs,&#13;
including adjustment of water tariffs, to achieve required financial objectives of&#13;
Hanoi WBC and Haiphong, Danang and Quang Ninh WSCs.&#13;
I For the Hanoi WBC, domestic tariff increased 50 times over the period 1988-1995, starting from 20&#13;
VND/m3. During the same period, price of electricity to the company increased 12 times while average company&#13;
salary increased 14 times.&#13;
2 Specific problem related to apartment blocks equipped with one water meter is taken into consideration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
5.4         The study estimates the average incremental financial cost (as a proxy&#13;
for long run marginal cost) in Hanoi to be VND 2,867/m3 and concludes, based on an&#13;
affordability analysis, that tariffs cannot be raised to this level immediately but&#13;
would have to converge to the full cost over a period of more than five years. The&#13;
study recommends an average 1997 tariff in Hanoi of VND l,910/m3 which is considered&#13;
affordable based on an accepted 4% of household income affordability criterion. The&#13;
average tariff implemented in Hanoi in mid-1996 is VND 1,700/m3 which is in line&#13;
with the study recommendations.&#13;
B. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
5.5         The Ministry of Finance (MF) is responsible for issuing guidelines and&#13;
standards on the accounting and financial management of state organizations. WSCs&#13;
budget requests and reports are submitted through the TUPWS or CD to the PCs. The&#13;
finance department of each WSC uses cash-based accounting; it prepares monthly or&#13;
quarterly accounts using the recently introduced national standard accounting system&#13;
which supports cost-centered analysis of expenditures.   Year-end accounts are&#13;
currently audited by the PCs, but MF requires that independent auditors be appointed&#13;
in all cities during 1997. These auditors will have to be confirmed to be acceptable&#13;
to IDA. The WSCs will maintain the project accounts.&#13;
5.6         Hanoi WBC accounts were partly computerized from 1993-1995, and are&#13;
organized into internal cost accounting units covering the treatment plants and&#13;
distribution enterprises. The program to complete the computerization and transfer&#13;
existing accounts to the new system is underway.   The computerized billing and&#13;
collection system will be reviewed under the project and upgraded where necessary&#13;
to include control accounts.&#13;
5.7         Haiphong WSC manually prepared cash-based accounts through to 1995.  In&#13;
1996, under a Finnish-funded water supply and sanitation program, accounts are being&#13;
computerized and a management accounting and information system introduced to&#13;
support institutional development and help the managers effectively run the company.&#13;
A new computerized billing and collection and accounts receivable system will be&#13;
introduced under the project.&#13;
5.8         Quang Ninh WSC uses a manual general ledger system of accounts, with&#13;
transactions recorded on a cash basis. The project's technical assistance program&#13;
will upgrade the accounting and management information system and transfer manual&#13;
accounts to a computerized accrual-based system that uses an internal cost and&#13;
profit center analysis. It will begin in 1997 and be completed in 2-3 years.&#13;
5.9         Danang WSC's accounts are fully computerized using data base software.&#13;
Under the project, a technical assistance program would review the system to ensure&#13;
all accounting controls and internal cost accounting units are established, and that&#13;
results comply with internationally recognized accounting standards.&#13;
5.10        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the annual financial&#13;
statements of the Hanoi WBC, Haiphong WSC, Quang Ninh WSC, and Danang WSC would be&#13;
audited by firms acceptable to the IDA and submitted to the IDA within nine months&#13;
of the close of each fiscal year. The Government would maintain the Statement of&#13;
Expenditures and the special accounts for the ITF credit and Danish Trust Fund, and&#13;
audit reports which would include separate opinions on these Statements, would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
prepared by firms acceptable to the IDA and submitted to the IDA within nine months&#13;
of the close of each fiscal year. It was agreed that because current accounting&#13;
systems and procedures are not capable of readily producing financial statements in&#13;
accordance with internationally accepted standards or principles and the fact that&#13;
the statements have not been audited in the past, the first audit reports would be&#13;
due by September 1999 and would include audits of the companies' accounts for FY98&#13;
and project accounts only for FY97.&#13;
C. Billing and Collections&#13;
5.11        In Hanoi, the WBC's district water enterprises read meters (25W of&#13;
registered connections are metered) and send the results to headquarters.   Monthly&#13;
bills are prepared centrally and include a 10% charge for sewerage. In 1995, there&#13;
were 128,000 registered customers, but partly due to administrative weaknesses, only&#13;
about 90,000 bills were issued each month. Payment is due within one month of the&#13;
billing. Accounts receivable at the end of 1995 were equal to 68 days' sales. The&#13;
bad debt provision for 1995 was 2% of gross sales, and the same figure was included&#13;
in financial projections through 2004.&#13;
5.12        About 44% of Haiphong's WSC connections are unmetered. The billing&#13;
system is computerized and uses data-base software, but does not include accounting&#13;
controls or a ledger.   Customers are given 10 days to pay,  and service is&#13;
disconnected after 20 days of non-payment. A Japanese Grant-financed technical&#13;
assistance to be implemented by the Haiphong WSC in 1997/1998 will design and&#13;
introduce a new computerized accounting software module for the billing, collection&#13;
and accounts receivable ledger. The new system will have adequate controls and will&#13;
be designed to interface with the general ledger.&#13;
5.13        Although over half the connections in Quang Ninh WSC are un-metered,&#13;
meter readers visit every connection once a month and manually prepare the bills and&#13;
collect the fees based on the meter data or number of occupants. The WSC recognizes&#13;
the system is unsatisfactory and needs to computerize the system.   Thus, the&#13;
technical assistance under the project will make this issue a priority.&#13;
5.14        All of Danang WSC's connections are metered and read every month and&#13;
customers are given 20 days to pay their bills. The billing system is computerized,&#13;
using data base software, but does not include proper accounting controls.  The&#13;
system will be reviewed and upgraded through the technical assistance program&#13;
provided under the project.&#13;
D. Fixed Assets and Revaluation&#13;
5.15        Until early 1995, fixed assets held by WSCs were owned by the PCs and&#13;
the depreciation charge was transferred partly or totally to the PCs, depending on&#13;
their share of investment funding.   Thus,  the WSCs were not responsible for&#13;
financing major replacements or new investments. To ensure that WSCs would self-&#13;
finance capital works and meet their debt service obligations, the Government&#13;
decided in 1995 to abolish the remittance of depreciation charges.&#13;
5.16        WSCs maintain registers for assets used in water operations, including&#13;
depreciation, over the estimated life expectancy. All the WSCs updated inventories&#13;
of fixed assets as of December 31, 1995, and these valuations have been used to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
adjust financial projections.   The book value of fixed assets is projected to&#13;
increase each year by the annual inflation rate.&#13;
E. Past Financial Performance&#13;
5.17        The WSCs' recent financial performance in the project cities has been&#13;
unsatisfactory. In some, the companies appeared to cover a number of recurrent or&#13;
capital costs, but depreciation was considerably understated. Also, maintenance was&#13;
inadequate, which meant that true operating costs were not reflected on the income&#13;
statements.    Further,  the  PCs had  continually  subsidized  the  WSCs  for new&#13;
construction and major repairs, even as the water supply systems deteriorated and&#13;
water losses increased.   Since the end of 1994 programs for corrective actions&#13;
leading to elimination of subsidies have been introduced in Hanoi and Haiphong and&#13;
evidence from Haiphong indicates improving tendencies.&#13;

5.19        Future finances. The institutional assistance program under the project&#13;
will, among other things, help the WSC reduce NRW levels, expected to drop from 66%&#13;
in 1996 to 49% in 2001, and to 46% in 2004. The provincial PC has given its support&#13;
for tariff increases of about 12% per annum.  As a result, the WBC's financial&#13;
performance should improve, with revenues covering operating and maintenance costs&#13;
by 1999, and non-operating costs by 2001. To help finance its immediate and future&#13;
investment needs, the company will need to generate at least 3% of its capital&#13;
expenditure requirements from internal sources from 1997 onwards, and at least 20%&#13;
after 2001. Financial projections for the WBC until 2004 are shown in Annex 9, and&#13;
the assumptions are listed in Annex 10.&#13;
5.20        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Hanoi WBC will take&#13;
all necessary measures, including adjusting the structure or levels of tariffs, to&#13;
ensure it recovers its operating costs in full, maintains a debt service ratio of&#13;
at least 1.2, and a self-financing ratio of at least 3% beginning in FY98, and 20%&#13;
in FY02.&#13;
5.21        From 1997-2004, the company,s revenues and operating income are expected&#13;
to increase by about 325%, and net income, after interest expenses, from a negative&#13;
figure in 1997 to VND 137 billion in 2004, with an average rate of return of 12% on&#13;
net fixed assets before interest and taxes.   Net internal cash generation is&#13;
expected to increase from VND 7 billion to VND 172 billion over the same period,&#13;
even after substantial increases in debt service payments, from VND 0.4 billion in&#13;
1997 to VND 44.6 billion in 2004. WBC's current ratio is projected to remain at or&#13;
above 2.6, and debt service ratio should not be under 2.4, both of which are&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
Haiphong Water Supply Company&#13;
5.22        Financial  plan.  Haiphong WSC's  capital  spending  requirements  and&#13;
financial plan for the 1997-2001 project period are presented in Table 5.2. The&#13;
financial plan, including the Government's equity contribution, was confirmed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
5.23        Future finances. Partly as a result of a Finnish aid program, the&#13;
company's financial performance should improve during the project period,&#13;
registering profits (before interest and taxes) after 1998. Financial projections&#13;
until 2004 are presented in Annex 9, and the assumptions appear in Annex 10.&#13;
5.24        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Haiphong's WSC would&#13;
take all necessary measures, including adjusting the structure or levels of tariffs,&#13;
to ensure it recovers its operating costs in full, maintains a debt service coverage&#13;
ratio of at least 1.2, and a self-financing ratio of at least 3t beginning in FY98,&#13;
and 20% in FY02.&#13;
5.25        From 1997-2004,  the company's revenues are expected to increase by&#13;
around 300%, achieving an average rate of return of 10% by 2004. Net internal cash&#13;
generation is projected to increase from VND 4 billion in 1997 to VND 35 billion in&#13;
2004, despite the company' s need to meet debt service payments beginning in 2002 (as&#13;
a result of this project). The WSC's current ratio is expected not to fall below&#13;
1.3, and the debt service ratio should not be under 1.2, both of which are adequate.&#13;

5.26        Financial plan. Quang Ninh WSC's capital requirements and financial plan&#13;
for 1997-2001 are shown in Table 5.3.  The financial plan, including the equity&#13;
contribution  from the Government  and the Provincial  People's  Committee,  was&#13;
confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
5.27        Future finances.  The company's financial performance is expected to&#13;
improve during the projection period with revenues covering operating and&#13;
maintenance costs by 1998 and achieving an average rate of return of 7% by 2004.&#13;
However, its liquidity is not expected to substantially improve until the benefits&#13;
of the project are fully realized through increased water production and sales. To&#13;
help finance its immediate and future investment needs, the company will need the&#13;
continued financial support from the PC through 2002, with an equity contribution&#13;
estimated at VND 45 billion in the implementation period. From 2004 onwards, the&#13;
WSC should generate about 9% to 10% of its capital expenditure requirements from&#13;
internal sources. Financial projections for the WSC until 2004 are shown in Annex&#13;
9, and the assumptions used in preparing these projections are in Annex 10.&#13;

5.28        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Quang Ninh WSC would&#13;
take all necessary measures including adjusting its structure or levels of tariffs&#13;
to maintain for each of its fiscal years a ratio of total expenses to total&#13;
operating revenues not higher than 100% beginning in FY98, 85% in FY02, and 65% in&#13;
FY05.&#13;
5.29        An increase in water billed of around 5% annually, coupled with annual&#13;
tariff increases of about 10%, are expected to raise the company's revenues by 380%&#13;
between 1997-2004. Net internal cash generation is projected to grow from VND 2.6&#13;
billion in 1997 to VND 16.7 billion in 2004, and debt service payments are expected&#13;
to rise from VND 1.0 billion to VND 28.7 billion. The company's current ratio is&#13;
projected to be on the low side, down to 0.6 in 2001 but increasing to 2.0 in 2004;&#13;
the debt service ratio will also be low, from 0.6 in 2002 to 1.6 in 2004.&#13;

5.31        Future finances. To adequately support the project, the WSC's financial&#13;
performance will need to improve through higher sales volumes of about 6% annually&#13;
through 2000, and also through higher tariffs. It is projected that the WSC will&#13;
achieve an average rate of return of 7% in 2004.   The company will need the&#13;
continued financial support from the PC until 2001, with an equity contribution&#13;
during the period estimated at VND 45 billion. From 2004 onwards, the WSC should&#13;
generate about 10% from internal sources to help finance its future investment&#13;
program. Between 1997-2004, the WSC's revenues need to increase over sixfold.&#13;
5.32        The WSC's current ratio is projected to be on the low side, down to 0.5&#13;
in 2002; debt service ratio will also be low, but should reach 1.4 in 2004. The&#13;
company' s financial projections until 2004 are shown in Annex 9, and the assumptions&#13;
used are in Annex 10.&#13;
5.33        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Danang WSC would take&#13;
all necessary measures, including adjusting the structure or level of its tariffs,&#13;
to maintain for each of its fiscal years, a ratio of total expenses to total&#13;
operating revenues not higher than 100% beginning in FY98, 85% in FY02, and 65% in&#13;
FY05.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
G. Financial Rates of Return&#13;
5.34        Based on the above financial projections presented in detail in Annex&#13;
9 and the assumptions presented in Annex 10, the financial internal rates of return&#13;
(FIRR) for the four project components have been calculated. The FIRRs for the&#13;
Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang components are 28%, 13%, 8% and 8%,&#13;
respectively. The analysis is presented in Annex 12.&#13;
5.35         The base year is taken as 1995, the last year for which actual data is&#13;
available. Without the project, operating efficiency would deteriorate significantly&#13;
due to ageing of already obsolete equipment. While this would be non-linear and&#13;
discontinuous, a linear approximation of a half percent real annual increase in&#13;
operating costs is used in the analysis to reflect all the impacts of the&#13;
deterioration. The 1995 tariff is assumed to remain constant in real terms since&#13;
there would be no justification for tariff increases without the project. Even if&#13;
tariffs are increased, real revenues are likely to remain unchanged because&#13;
consumers would disconnect from the utility and resort to self-provisioning in the&#13;
face of deteriorating service. In the "with project" scenario, O&amp;M expenditures,&#13;
tariffs and percentage of water billed are assumed to increase as indicated in Annex&#13;
10. Efficiency gains that would result from lower per unit electricity consumption&#13;
are ignored. The FIRRs are calculated over 20 years and a 50% salvage value is&#13;
assumed.&#13;
5.36        The FIRRs are dependant on the projected tariff and NRW estimates which&#13;
have therefore been forecast conservatively. In Hanoi, for example, average tariff&#13;
per m3 is projected to increase from VND 1,420 in 1995 gradually to VND 2,213 in&#13;
1999, VND 3,331 in 2002 and VND 4,796 in 2004 yielding a total increase of 238% over&#13;
the period 1995-2004. The projected tariff stream is below the affordable tariff&#13;
stream recommended for Hanoi by the ADB National Tariff Study and has been agreed&#13;
by the Hanoi PC. The proposed tariff increase needs to be seen in reference to a&#13;
domestic tariff increase in Hanoi of 4900% during the period 1988-1995 (para 5.1)&#13;
5.37        NRW in Hanoi, for example, is projected to decrease from 69% in 1995 to&#13;
51% by 1999, 48% by 2002 and 46% by 2004. Given the findings of the customer&#13;
management survey conducted in Hanoi by Saur International (para 4.14), the decrease&#13;
of NRW in rehabilitated wards in Haiphong from 70% to 30* within three years and an&#13;
existing NRW of 33% in Danang, these targets are considered very reasonable.&#13;
However, continuing attention would need to be devoted to these parameters because&#13;
of the sensitivity of the FIRR to variations in them.&#13;
5.38        The sensitivity analysis reported in Annex 12 (Table A 12.5) shows that&#13;
the FIRR for the project falls from 16% to 13% if the tariff increase falls 10%&#13;
below forecasted values; to 15t if NRW reduction is 10% less than estimated; and to&#13;
14.5% if there is a 10% over run in capital costs. The FIRRs are insensitive to&#13;
project life and salvage value.&#13;
5.39        In standard analysis, the impact of tariff increases and metering on&#13;
consumption would need to be considered because of the price elasticity of demand.&#13;
However, standard analysis assumes no pent up demand, no change in the quality of&#13;
the product and no hidden expenditures asides from the price charged. None of these&#13;
assumptions holds in the case of the situation in Vietnam. The national tariff study&#13;
confirms that households are consuming less than their desired amount because of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
supply constraints. Secondly, the water to be provided after the project would be&#13;
qualitatively different compared to that available presently both in terms of&#13;
quality and service level; willingness to pay for potable water at a higher service&#13;
level is greater than existing charges. Thirdly, households are spending to improve&#13;
the quality of existing water (through boiling, installing storage tanks and&#13;
operating electric pumps) an amount on average at least equal to if not exceeding&#13;
the existing monthly bill. Thus, the real cost of water is actually expected to&#13;
decrease after the project when the necessity for additional private expenditures&#13;
by households is removed. In addition to the above factors, urban incomes have been&#13;
rising steadily in Vietnam contributing to increased consumption demand. Given the&#13;
above, it is not considered necessary to adjust per capita consumption downwards&#13;
because of the projected increase in tariffs.&#13;
5.40        In relative terms, the rates of return vary substantially in the four&#13;
cities, which can be explained by city-specific conditions. It is highest in Hanoi&#13;
because both water production and efficiency increase significantly, it is the only&#13;
city with groundwater supply resulting in low production costs, and the customer&#13;
base is the largest, which brings high savings to consumers. In Haiphong, while the&#13;
project would not produce additional water, efficiency gains would be significant,&#13;
while project costs would be low since no new facilities would be built. Both Quang&#13;
Ninh and Danang have very low coverage (1995 population coverage in Quang Ninh and&#13;
Danang was 16% and 42%, respectively, compared to 82% and 98% in Hanoi and Haiphong)&#13;
resulting in higher per unit costs. In Danang, system efficiency (in terms of the&#13;
proportion of water that is billed) is already very high and improvement under the&#13;
project would be slight. However, project costs are the highest because completely&#13;
new intake and treatment facilities need to be constructed.&#13;
H. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
5.41        Performance would be monitored against the implementation schedule&#13;
(Annex 4) and the project implementation plan (Annex 5), while the agencies'&#13;
operational, financial and managerial performance will be assessed against the&#13;
monitoring indicators in Annex 11. The key performance indicators are percentage of&#13;
NRW, number of household connections, and the financial working ratio. These relate,&#13;
respectively, to the desired project goals of rehabilitating the networks, expanding&#13;
coverage, and improving financial performance of the WSCs. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained that the WSCs would provide IDA on June 30 and December 31&#13;
with semi-annual progress reports, including revised project cost estimates,&#13;
implementing schedules and monitoring indicators, the first of such reports to be&#13;
furnished by June 30, 1998. Annual updated financial projections would be submitted&#13;
no later than September 30 of each project year beginning in 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Proiect Benefits&#13;
6.1         The proposed project in Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang aims to:&#13;
(a) rehabilitate and expand facilities to meet coverage, consumption and quality&#13;
targets for the year 2000; (b) improve institutional capacity and operational&#13;
efficiency of the WSCs to sustain the physical investments; and (c) prepare an&#13;
investment and institutional development program to satisfy system demands after&#13;
2000 with maximum self-financing and private sector participation.&#13;
6.2         The  project  is  part  of  the  Government's  plan  to  upgrade  all&#13;
infrastructure in three key economic regions in order to remove constraints to&#13;
industrial development and tourism, to meet demands due to increased urbanization&#13;
and rising incomes, to meet environmental standards and to provide access to safe&#13;
drinking water. Hanoi, Haiphong and Quang Ninh are part of the northeastern economic&#13;
triangle and Danang is the designated growth center in central Vietnam.   Hanoi,&#13;
Haiphong and Danang have been identified for priority development as industrial and&#13;
commercial centers to absorb foreign direct investment while Danang and Halong City&#13;
in Quang Ninh province are designated for development as major tourist attractions.&#13;
6.3         Project contributions to development of industrial,  commercial and&#13;
tourism potential in the cities would translate into benefits resulting in higher&#13;
urban incomes and property values. Better service levels in terms of system&#13;
reliability, continuous supply and higher pressure would eliminate household&#13;
expenditures on storage tanks and electric motors designed to compensate for poor&#13;
service. Improved quality of drinking water which presently does not meet national&#13;
standards would eliminate household expenditures incurred on boiling water which is&#13;
a necessity in Vietnam. In addition, improved water quality would reduce health&#13;
expenditures resulting from the prevalence of water borne diseases. Households&#13;
presently without access to piped water would realize time and money savings when&#13;
recourse to vendors or wells would be made unnecessary in addition to health&#13;
benefits from the availability of potable water. Industrial and commercial&#13;
establishments currently pumping groundwater would not need to do so resulting in&#13;
environmental benefits.&#13;
6.4         Institutional development aimed at commercializing the water companies&#13;
would attract private investment in the sector and increase the ability of the&#13;
companies to self-finance future capital expenditure. Both outcomes would reduce the&#13;
need for public subsidies which could yield higher social benefits in other sectors.&#13;
6.5         Without the project, the deterioration of physical assets which have&#13;
suffered from prolonged lack of maintenance would accelerate. Equipment life would&#13;
be reduced, efficiency would decline, operating costs would increase, the quality&#13;
of water would deteriorate, more outages would occur and more consumers would&#13;
disconnect from the system, providing water for themselves. Water scarcities would&#13;
result given the increasing urban population. The possibility of water riots cannot&#13;
be ruled out; such riots directed against the water company occurred in Haiphong in&#13;
1993 resulting in the death of a company employee. The Government's infrastructure&#13;
package for the key economic regions would remain incomplete and ability of the&#13;
cities to attract foreign investment and tourism would be negatively affected.&#13;
Construction of facilities for tourists in a number of cities is already on hold&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
because of water and power shortages.&#13;
B. Least-Cost Solution&#13;
6.6         The Government's commitment to the project is not explicitly based on&#13;
a project rate of return analysis because a number of strategic social, development,&#13;
environmental and health objectives cannot be quantified precisely in terms of&#13;
benefits. There is no alternative to meeting, at the very least, the minimum&#13;
consumption requirements of the urban population, preferably with an acceptable&#13;
quality of water. Consequently, the Government's objective is to attain a minimum&#13;
defined level of coverage, consumption, service, and water quality by 2000 in the&#13;
major urban centers at the least cost. The alternative options evaluated are&#13;
detailed in the feasibility studies which are available in the project file. Out of&#13;
these, the least cost alternatives have been selected for the project.&#13;
C. Rate of Return&#13;
6.7         Notwithstanding the above, based on partial quantification of benefits&#13;
and costs and conservative assumptions, economic rates of return have been&#13;
calculated for the project components. The financial internal rates of return,&#13;
reported in para 5.34, are used as the starting point to compute the economic&#13;
internal rates of return.&#13;
6.8         To convert financial costs to economic costs, taxes and duties have been&#13;
eliminated. The relatively free exchange rate implies that there is no significant&#13;
foreign exchange premium. The major operating cost is due to electricity, comprising&#13;
more than half of total operating costs, which is being charged to the WSCs at the&#13;
long run marginal cost of electricity without any distortion. Regarding local wage&#13;
costs, it has been determined that market (or financial) wage rates broadly reflect&#13;
the opportunity cost of skilled labor in Vietnam taking into account the increasing&#13;
shortage of qualified technical staff. Although minimum wage levels may distort wage&#13;
rates for unskilled labor somewhat above market levels, the more skilled labor force&#13;
which predominates in the WSCs is likely to be virtually unaffected. With respect&#13;
to unskilled labor, a shadow wage factor of 0.6 is proposed. However, sensitivity&#13;
analysis indicates that the impact is insignificant since labor costs are a small&#13;
proportion of total supply costs. The prices of treatment chemicals are reported to&#13;
be distorted but again this is a small proportion and is ignored. Rather, the&#13;
impacts of labor and chemical cost distortions are captured through sensitivity of&#13;
the results to total costs. Net present value is calculated using a real discount&#13;
rate of 10%.&#13;
6.9         The only benefits quantified for inclusion in the economic analysis&#13;
relate to the coping costs consumers would avoid because of the project. Earlier&#13;
research has shown that water tariff is not the only cost borne by consumers.&#13;
Rather, the inefficiencies of water supply companies are passed on in terms of extra&#13;
costs to consumers who attempt to improve their service by installing underground&#13;
and overhead storage tanks and operate electric motors to pump water or use backup&#13;
devices like handpumps. Also, they incur additional expenses to purify the water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
by boiling or using filters'. Data from HCM City indicates that households connected&#13;
to the water supply system incur additional costs of 300,000 VND per month.&#13;
Households without access to the piped system incur even higher costs since the&#13;
price of water purchased from vendors exceeds the price of piped water.&#13;
6.10        Full benefits of avoided coping costs are unlikely to be realized&#13;
immediately since they are dependent on changes in consumer behavior and confidence&#13;
in the reliability of the improved service which will build up gradually. In the&#13;
"with project" scenario, it is assumed that household avoided costs of 33,000 VND&#13;
per month would start being realized in 1999 and would stabilize at 45,000 VND per&#13;
month in 2001.&#13;
6.11        Benefits resulting from improved health and environment, higher incomes&#13;
and property values due to the development impact of improved water service, and&#13;
availability of piped water to non-domestic users presently relying on groundwater&#13;
are ignored in the analysis. Therefore, the rates of return calculated will be&#13;
grossly under-estimated and are only intended to confirm that they are above the&#13;
hurdle rate commonly used for water supply projects.&#13;
6.12        In the "without project" scenario, the continued system deterioration&#13;
would impose increased coping costs on domestic consumers. It is conservatively&#13;
assumed that additional monthly coping costs of 2,000 VND would be imposed. These&#13;
would increase by 2,000 VND per year stabilizing at a level of 10,000 VND per month&#13;
after 5 years. Costs to non-domestic consumers and to the economy resulting from&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks are ignored.&#13;
6.13        Resource costs that merit consideration in a water supply project&#13;
pertain to the cost of the raw water and environmental costs. In Hanoi, the&#13;
groundwater aquifer is recharged from the Red River and is not mined. The reserves&#13;
are estimated to be sufficient to meet demand upto 2010. There is no alternative use&#13;
of the groundwater and therefore no opportunity cost is attributed. In Quang Ninh&#13;
province, water is provided from a dedicated dam with no agricultural use and&#13;
involving no opportunity cost. In Haiphong and Danang, surface water is used which&#13;
could have alternative employment in agriculture. An opportunity cost of 50 VND/m3&#13;
is used based on data available from the National Tariff Study.&#13;
6.14        Environmental costs pertain to the cost of disposing the wastewater&#13;
generated. However, in the proposed project, net additional water is not being&#13;
produced. First, capacity expansion is limited. Second, the additional pped water&#13;
produced by the WSCs would provide access to presently non-connected households.&#13;
These households are presently using water from alternative sources which would be&#13;
substituted by the piped water. Given that the project aims to provide 80% coverage&#13;
at minimum consumption levels, the entire impact would be one of substitution,&#13;
displacing non-piped sources. Therefore environmental costs are not imputed to the&#13;
project.&#13;
6.15        Based  on  the  above  set  of  conservative  assumptions  and  partial&#13;
1 The 1992 World Development Report, pp. 98-99, estimates that in Jakarta, Indonesia, households spend&#13;
an amount equal to one percent of the city's gross domestic product, US$50 million, only on boiling water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
quantification of benefits and costs, the estimates of the economic internal rates&#13;
of return (EIRR) for the four project components and the overall project are as&#13;
follows: Hanoi, 19%; Haiphong, 24%; Quang Ninh, 12%; Danang, 11%; and the overall&#13;
project, 17%. All rates exceed the commonly used hurdle rate of 10t and confirm that&#13;
the project as a whole and each component individually is economically justified.&#13;
6.16        Actual rates of return based on inclusion of all benefits are likely to&#13;
be an order of magnitude higher than those computed and therefore quite robust&#13;
against typical variations in costs and benefits. Benefits, in terms of avoided&#13;
costs, have been estimated very conservatively. However, we can test project&#13;
sensitivity to a further 10% decrease in benefits. Typical cost overruns are not&#13;
expected to exceed lot of capital and O&amp;M costs. Capital costs are designed to be&#13;
controlled because of procurement through single supply and install contracts in&#13;
each city. O&amp;M costs have a lot of slack built in them because existing costs are&#13;
not adjusted for efficiencies resulting from reduced electricity consumption because&#13;
of replacement of ageing and obsolete equipment and from reduction in staff levels&#13;
as the WSCs are commercialized.&#13;
6.17        Sensitivity analysis shows that the overall project rate of return falls&#13;
from 17% to 12% for the worst case, where benefits decrease by 10% and both capital&#13;
and O&amp;M costs increase by 10%. For 10% percent variations from the base case, the&#13;
rate of return is most sensitive to benefit reduction (falling to 14%), less&#13;
sensitive to capital cost increases (falling to 15%) and least sensitive to an&#13;
increase in O&amp;M costs (falling to 16%). In no situation does the project EIRR fall&#13;
below acceptable levels. Annex 12 presents the assumptions made in calculating the&#13;
economic rates of return, the data used and the results including the sensitivity&#13;
analysis.&#13;
6.18        An alternative approach to quantifying project benefits would be to use&#13;
estimates of consumer willingness to pay per m3 of improved water. Studies in other&#13;
countries have consistently found that average willingness-to-pay for better service&#13;
exceeds the existing tariff charged. According to the survey carried out for the&#13;
National Water Tariff Policy Study (para 5.3), this is also true in Vietnam, where&#13;
the provision of water has been considered a social obligation and tariffs have been&#13;
considerably subsidized. However, methodologically acceptable estimates of consumer&#13;
willingness to pay for improved water are not available for the cities covered by&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
D. Affordability&#13;
6.19        Because of the avoided coping costs detailed above, the total price of&#13;
household water consumption is expected to fall after the project is implemented.&#13;
However, affordability analyses available for most developing countries exclude&#13;
coping costs and examine only the burden resulting from the price of piped water.&#13;
Surveys conducted for the National Water Tariff Policy Study show that existing&#13;
tariffs are affordable and that higher tariffs proposed by the Study could be&#13;
charged in 1995 without exceeding 4 percent of household income for ordinary and&#13;
"lifeline" domestic consumers. The 4 percent rule is commonly used as a measure of&#13;
affordability for water supply.&#13;
6.20        Hanoi was the only city covered by the Study which is also included in&#13;
the proposed project. Average monthly incomes for all households and those in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
lowest quintile were estimated at 1,200,000 VND and 650,000 VND, respectively, while&#13;
the corresponding expenditures for water were 19,500 VND and 11,300 VND.  These&#13;
expenditures translate into 1.6% and 1.5% of household income, well below the 4%&#13;
threshold.   The percentages were 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively in Thanh Hoa, the&#13;
smallest and poorest urban center included in the survey.&#13;
6.21        Based on the results and affordability analysis,  the Tariff Study&#13;
proposed an average tariff for Hanoi of 3560 VND per cubic meter in 2000 (the&#13;
average tariff in 1995 was 1420 VND) . By comparison, the financial projections for&#13;
the proposed IDA project are based on a tariff of 2478 VND in the same year. Thus,&#13;
the tariffs agreed to by the provincial governments are within the commonly accepted&#13;
affordability threshold. Reduction of coping costs would further decrease the total&#13;
costs presently being borne by households in the project cities.&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
6.22        Since the physical components  of the project deal primarily with&#13;
rehabilitating existing facilities, there are no unusual risks.  No irreversible&#13;
environmental impacts are expected and the protection of water sources and options&#13;
for disposal of treatment sludge (identified during project preparation) will be&#13;
addressed through special studies during implementation.&#13;
6.23        The engineering preparation was guided by the need to reduce land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement as much as possible. Thus, the project will require&#13;
only limited land acquisition, relocation of population and demolition of houses&#13;
because most of the treatment plants, intakes and wellfields are located away from&#13;
residential areas.&#13;
6.24        A major risk to the project could stem from inadequate maintenance of&#13;
the rehabilitated facilities. Therefore, as part of project preparation, the water&#13;
companies have conducted an asset inventory which is being used to produce&#13;
maintenance guidelines based on standard engineering codes of practice. These&#13;
guidelines would be used to ensure adequate budgetary allocation for prevention and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
6.25        Another risk to project sustainability could arise from inadequate&#13;
incentives to improve financial and managerial performance. Therefore, the project&#13;
proposes a number of institutional development measures to be undertaken before and&#13;
during project implementation. These include training field and office personnel,&#13;
improving the billing, collection and customer management systems, introducing&#13;
performance contracts between the provincial governments and the water supply&#13;
companies, and public performance audits of all water supply companies by an&#13;
independent agency. Collaboration with a reputable international water systems&#13;
operator and with EDI has been initiated to assist with some of these tasks which&#13;
are considered critical success factors for the project.&#13;
6.26        Shortage of counterpart funds and coordination of activities funded by&#13;
different donors could slow project implementation. Financial plans indicating the&#13;
level of funding required from the provincial governments have been discussed and&#13;
agreed with the PCs and have been made part of the terms under which project&#13;
components have been approved by the Office of Government. Coordination problems are&#13;
mitigated by substantial assistance from the Resident Mission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

c.    The  Quang Ninh WSC  would  furnish by December  31,  1997  proposed&#13;
arrangements for periodic inspections of the Cao Van dam and that it would implement&#13;
recommendations of such inspections thereafter (para 3.33);&#13;
d.    The annual financial statements of the Hanoi WBC, Haiphong WSC, Quang&#13;
Ninh WSC, and Danang WSC would be audited by firms acceptable to the IDA and&#13;
submitted to the IDA within nine months of the close of each fiscal year. The first&#13;
audit reports would be due by September 1999 and would include audits of the&#13;
companies' accounts for FY98 and project accounts only for FY97. (para 5.10);&#13;
e.    Hanoi  and  Haiphong  WSCs  would  take  necessary  measures  including&#13;
adjusting the structure or level of tariffs, to ensure they recover operating costs&#13;
in full as well as maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2, and a&#13;
self-financing ratio of at least 3W beginning FY98, and 20% in FY02 (paras 5.20 and&#13;
5.24);&#13;
f.    Quang Ninh and Danang WSCs would take necessary measures including&#13;

47&#13;
years a ratio of total expenses to total operating revenues not higher than 100t in&#13;
FY98, 85% beginning in FY02, and 65% in FY05 (paras 5.28 and 5.33); and&#13;
h.    The WSCs would provide IDA with semiannual progress reports including&#13;
revised project cost estimates, implementing schedules and monitoring indicators on&#13;
June 30 and December 31 each year, the first of such reports to be furnished by June&#13;
30, 1998. Annual updated financial projections would be submitted no later than&#13;
September 30 of each project year, beginning in 1998 (para 5.41).&#13;
7.3         At negotiations, the Government and WSCs confirmed (a) onlending terms&#13;
(para 3.20); (b) adherence to implementation action plans (para 3.24); (c) adherence&#13;
to environmental management plans  (para 3.49);  (d)  adherence  to action plan&#13;
regarding obligations pertaining to households resettled from the Cao Van dam (para&#13;
3.30); (e) the content of periodical reports (para 3.52); and (f) their financial&#13;
plans (paras 5.18, 5.22, 5.26, 5.30).&#13;
7.4         The execution of Australian, Danish and Finnish Grant Agreements and&#13;
Danish Trust Fund (para 3.20) and the establishment of Resettlement Committees by&#13;
each of the PCs (para 3.28) are conditions of effectiveness.&#13;
7.5         Execution of subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and Hanoi&#13;
WBC, and Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang WSCs (para 3.20), and employment of&#13;
construction management consultants acceptable to IDA is a condition of disbursement&#13;
of funds related to that part of the project (para 3.22). Full disbursement of the&#13;
proceeds of the Danish Trust Fund is a condition of disbursement of the ITF credit&#13;
earmarked for the respective project component (para 3.40). Compliance with the&#13;
obligation to provide some additional assets (land and electrical connections) to&#13;
households resettled in Gia Lai province is a condition of disbursement of the&#13;
proceeds of the credit earmarked to finance all of Quang Ninh WSC project components&#13;
(para 3.30).&#13;
7.6         Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project&#13;
constitutes a suitable basis for an ITF credit of SDR 71.3 million (US$98.6 million&#13;
equivalent) , for a period of 40 years, including a grace period of ten years, at IDA&#13;
standard terms. The borrower would be the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.&#13;

VIETNAM&#13;
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Existing water supply, sewerage and solid waste services&#13;
HANOI COMPONENT&#13;
Population&#13;
1.    Hanoi, the country's capital, is Vietnam's second largest city, one of four&#13;
with provincial status. It is situated in the low-income and less developed&#13;
northern part of Vietnam, in the Red River delta some 100 km from the sea and&#13;
Haiphong port. In 1994 it accounted for about 6% of the country's GNP mainly made&#13;
up of services such as government, commerce, banking and education but also&#13;
manufacturing and agriculture. Nearly 900,000 are employed; 30% in services and&#13;
the remainder equally distributed between manufacturing and agriculture.&#13;
2.    The city is divided into four urban districts (quan) namely Ba Dinh, Hoan&#13;
Kiem, Dong Da and Hai Ba Trung, and five sub-urban districts ( Tu Liem, Gia Lam,&#13;
Than Tri, Dong Anh and Me Linh). The districts are divided into wards (phuong)&#13;
each containing 10,000-15,000 population. Since the city has provincial status&#13;
its Peoples' Committee reports directly to the national government and the&#13;
structure of the city government generally reflects that of the national&#13;
government. Typical organization of provincial government is shown in Chart 2.&#13;
3.    Hanoi's population has grown from 1.8 million in 1985 to about 2.2 million&#13;
in 1995, and is expected to increase to 2.5 million in 2005. The administrative&#13;
area of Hanoi city is 925 km2, of which about 883 km2 form a rural belt of five&#13;
suburban districts surrounding the developed urban center of about 42 km2. The&#13;
population of the four urban districts has grown from 0.8 million in 1985 to 1.1&#13;
million in 1995 and is expected to grow to 1.2 million in 2005. Population&#13;
density in urban Hanoi varies from about 80 persons per hectare (p/ha) to 1,400&#13;
p/ha with the most densely populated parts of the city in the old center (Hoan&#13;
Kiem district) and some parts of neighboring Hai Ba Trung and Dong Da districts.&#13;
4.    Urban land use master plan of 1993 proposed that by 2010 about 110 ha of&#13;
land currently used by agriculture be urbanized. Industrial areas are planned to&#13;
be relocated in suburban fringe downstream of the city where large area of land&#13;
will be prepared. Small scale industries will still remain in the urban area.&#13;
Water supply&#13;
5.    The water supply services are managed by Hanoi Water Business Company&#13;
(WBC),  a provincial business enterprise1,  reporting to the city's People's&#13;
' A business enterprise performs an economic activity and generates revenues from its sales. It is expected&#13;
to be financially self-supporting and legally independent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49                     ANNEX  1&#13;
Committee through its Transport and Urban Public Works Service (TUPWS). In the&#13;
current form, WBC was established in April 1994 through merging the earlier water&#13;
company, the water investment company and the training center. WBC staff of about&#13;
1,660 is divided into four functional groupings: (a) production, headed by the&#13;
deputy director, with the responsibility for water production in the eight water&#13;
plants, the electro-mechanical enterprise and the transport enterprise; (b)&#13;
distribution, headed by the deputy director, with the responsibility for water&#13;
distribution through six water business enterprises, the meter reading, billing,&#13;
collection and installation enterprise, and materials enterprise, which provides&#13;
stores support for the entire company; (c) services departments, which include&#13;
departments for planning, finance, organization and training, and legal, all&#13;
reporting directly to the general director and (d) construction.&#13;
6.    The production and distribution capacity of the WBC piped system in 1995&#13;
was 353,000 m3/d and the daily average production was 320,000 m3/d, including&#13;
about 69% of non-revenue water. Water services were provided to about 900,000&#13;
consisting of about 800,000 of the population in the four urban districts and&#13;
100,000 living in neighboring suburban districts through 123,000 connections and&#13;
about 1,000 public standposts. Out of total service connections, about 96% were&#13;
residential, using about 18% of water supplied; 49 were commercial, institutional&#13;
and industrial, using 13%; remaining 69 t was non-revenue water. Private wells,&#13;
both deep and shallow, are estimated to provide about 140,000 m3/d in addition&#13;
to WBC production, servicing additional about 110,000 people, commerce and&#13;
industry in WBC supply area.    The projected daily average water demand and&#13;
production capacity assuming 25% of NRW are shown in Table A-1.1.&#13;

7.    The water source is groundwater extracted by wells from alluvial deposits&#13;
along the Red River. The raw water has a high content of iron and manganese and&#13;
is treated prior to distribution. The waterworks facilities include 130 wells&#13;
65-70 m deep with diameters of 600 mm, clustered in 13 wellfields, eight&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50                     ANNEX  1&#13;
treatment plants of sizes varying from 18,000 m3/d to 60,000 m3/d, nine balancing&#13;
reservoirs with the total volume of 11,200 m3, eight treated water pump stations&#13;
with the total capacity of 9,900 m3/hour (240,000 m3/d) and about 400 km of mains&#13;
with diameters varying from 60 mm to 600 mm. The tertiary distribution network&#13;
is practically non-existent.&#13;
8.    During last ten years the WBC system has been rehabilitated with help from&#13;
Finnish government. These works, expected to be completed in early 1997, include&#13;
improvement of production and distribution facilities. All the rehabilitated&#13;
treatment plants work satisfactorily and completed parts of the network display&#13;
substantial improvement in the water pressure, however, parts of the old town&#13;
with population of about 170,000 still experience very low pressure and&#13;
intermittent service and remain to be rehabilitated. Since Hanoi solely depends&#13;
on groundwater the ever growing extractions by the WBC and private wells resulted&#13;
in some areas in land subsidence, reaching 5-10 mm per annum.&#13;
Sewerage and drainaqe&#13;
9.    Sewerage and drainage services are managed by the Hanoi Sanitation and&#13;
Drainage Company (SDC), an administrative enterprise2, reporting to city's PC&#13;
through its TUPWS. In 1995 SDC maintained 120 km of sewers and 35 km of open&#13;
channels operating as combined sewerage system. The system serves about 30% of&#13;
the urban area, is overloaded and in poor state of repair; it discharges into&#13;
city's lakes and rivers without treatment and level of maintenance and cleaning&#13;
is low. TUPWS, assisted by the Government of Japan, is preparing improvement and&#13;
expansion of the system with construction planned to start in 1998.&#13;
Nightsoil and septage disposal&#13;
10.   It is estimated that Hanoi population generates about 40 t/d of nightsoil&#13;
from bucket collection, 60 t/d is stored in pit and vault latrines and 150 t/d&#13;
is disposed of in septic tanks. Of this quantity about 60-70 t/d of nightsoil and&#13;
septage from pits, vaults and septic tanks is collected and disposed of at Me Tri&#13;
landfill. The remaining is used by farmers.&#13;
Solid waste management&#13;
11.   The  solid  waste  services  are  managed  by  URENCO,  an  administrative&#13;
enterprise, reporting to PC through its TUPWS. In 1995 URENCO has collected daily&#13;
about 300 ton of solid waste and disposed it of at the Me Tri landfill about 8&#13;
km west from the city center. Only about 35%-40% of total generated solid waste&#13;
estimated at 1,000 t/d is collected. The rest is burned or buried at source or&#13;
scattered. The landfill has reached the end of its life and is being closed. A&#13;
new site at Tham Hiep with an area of about 20 ha and with expected life of 5&#13;
years has been selected and the construction started in 1996.&#13;
2 An administrative enterprise renders public service to the community. It is almost entirely funded from&#13;
public sources, normally from the budget of the local government by which it is licensed.&#13;

HAIPHONG COMPONENT&#13;
Population&#13;
12.   Haiphong is Vietnam's fourth largest city, one of the four with provincial&#13;
status. It is situated in the less developed northern part of Vietnam, on the&#13;
right bank of the Red River delta in the Gulf of Tonkin. The major economic&#13;
activities include the port which is the biggest in Vietnam, the shipyard and&#13;
cement factory. Nearly 600,000 are employed; 30% in services and the remainder&#13;
equally distributed between manufacturing and agriculture.&#13;
13.   The city is divided in three urban districts (Hong Bang, Le Chan and Ngo&#13;
Quyen), and seven rural districts (Thuy Nguyen, An Hai, An Lao, Kien Thuy, Tien&#13;
Lang, Vin Bao and the island district Cat Hai). The semi-urban neighborhoods are&#13;
being developed in the south of the urban districts around towns Kien An and Do&#13;
So, about 8 km and 15 km distant, respectively. These are planned to be upgraded&#13;
to urban districts in the near future. Since the city has provincial status its&#13;
Peoples' Committee reports directly to the national government and the structure&#13;
of the city government generally reflects that of the national government.&#13;
14.   Haiphong's population of 1.6 million in 1993 is expected to grow to about&#13;
1.8 million in 2000, and to 2.2 million in 2010. The administrative area of&#13;
Haiphong city is 1,500 km2, of which about 1,480 km2 form a circle of islands and&#13;
rural districts around the developed urban center with and area of 20 km2,&#13;
planned to increase to 27 km2 and 37 km2 in 2000 and 2010. The 1993 population&#13;
in the three urban districts of 400,000 is expected to grow to 450,000 and&#13;
550,000 in 2000 and 2010. The 1993 population of Kien An and Do So towns of&#13;
88,000 is expected to grow to 100,000 and 120,000 in 2000 and 2010.&#13;
Water supply&#13;
15.   Water supply services are managed by Haiphong Water Supply Company (WSC),&#13;
a business enterprise, reporting to the city's PC through TUPWS. Haiphong WSC&#13;
service area includes three urban districts, Kien An and Do Son towns. Its staff&#13;
of 620 is divided into four functional groupings: (a) production, laboratory and&#13;
workshop, headed by the deputy director; (b) consumer services, distribution and&#13;
booster stations, also headed by the deputy director; (c) services departments,&#13;
which include planning, materials, personnel, accounting and administration all&#13;
reporting directly to the General Director; and (d) construction.&#13;
16.   The production and distribution capacity of the water supply system and the&#13;
daily average production in 1995 was 125,000 m3/d or 300 lcd, including about 69%&#13;
of non-revenue water. Water services were provided to commerce, institutions,&#13;
industry and 420,000 or 98% of urban population through 31,000 metered and 25,000&#13;
unmetered connections.   Out of 56,000 service connections,  about 97% were&#13;
residential, using about 24% of water supplied; 3% were commercial, institutional&#13;
and industrial, using 7% of water; remaining 69% was non-revenue water.  The&#13;
projected daily average water demand and production capacity assuming 25% of NRW&#13;
are shown in Table A-1.2.&#13;

17.   The source is surface water treated in five treatment plants. All plants&#13;
are supplied from tidal regulated rivers fed by Thai Binh River system flowing&#13;
to Haiphong from northwest. The raw water has occasionally high turbidity and&#13;
shows low levels of organic pollution. The waterworks facilities include five&#13;
intakes, several kilometers of raw water transmission canals and mains, five&#13;
treatment plants of sizes varying from 5,000 m3/d to 60,000 m3/d, six balancing&#13;
reservoirs with the total volume of 3,050 m3, five treated water pump stations&#13;
with the total capacity of 4,100 m3/hour (95,000 m3/d) and about 160 km of&#13;
transmission mains with diameters varying from 150 mm to 600 mm. Most&#13;
transmission mains are made of cast iron and galvanized steel. The tertiary&#13;
distribution network is practically non-existent. The majority of mains have&#13;
never been pressurized over one bar, external and internal corrosion is common,&#13;
and joints and fittings are leaking, generally beyond repair.&#13;
18.   The WSC system is rehabilitated with help from Finnish government. The&#13;
works  include  improvement  of production  and distribution  facilities.  The&#13;
reduction of non-revenue water has been implemented from 1994 by constructing new&#13;
"phuong distribution systems". Phuong system normally has no more than three&#13;
connections to secondary network and all houses are provided with metered&#13;
connections. The experiment started nearest to An Duong treatment plant and by&#13;
December 1995 nine phuongs with 50, 000 population were rehabilitated and provided&#13;
with 11,000 connections. Completed parts of the network display substantial&#13;
improvement in the water pressure. The majority of the town which remains to be&#13;
rehabilitated experience very low pressure and intermittent service.&#13;
Sewerage and drainage&#13;
19.   Sewerage and drainage services in the three urban districts are managed by&#13;
the Haiphong Sewerage and Drainage Company (SDC) an administrative enterprise&#13;
reporting to PC through TUPWS. Other towns, such as Kien An and Do Son, have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53                     ANNEX  1&#13;
their own organizations for environmental services. Urban Haiphong is served by&#13;
170 km of combined sewers conveying stormwater and wastewater. The network&#13;
consists of open ditches, close conduits and several major box sewers. Due to its&#13;
age and absence of maintenance the network is in a poor state of repair. Besides&#13;
on-site treatment, such as septic tanks or some basic facilities in industrial&#13;
establishments, no treatment of wastewater exists. Household sanitation is very&#13;
basic. The 1989 census showed that about 11,000 (46%) of urban household have no&#13;
latrine of their own, often shared with neighboring households. Remaining 54% of&#13;
households used 420 public latrines or resort to any other open place.&#13;
Nichtsoil and septage disposal&#13;
20.   About 35 t/d of nightsoil was collected in 1995 in urban Haiphong. In&#13;
addition, about 100 t/d is used for small individual gardening. Septage from&#13;
about 5,500 septic tanks and the nightsoil is either sold to farmers or disposed&#13;
of in the landfill and also in the nearest sewer or lake. The septage and&#13;
nightsoil are applied to agricultural land and fishpond with no preliminary&#13;
treatment or conditioning.&#13;
Solid waste management&#13;
21.   The solid waste services are managed by Haiphong URENCO, an administrative&#13;
enterprise established in 1964, reporting to PC through its TUPWS. In addition&#13;
to solid waste URENCO also manages collection and disposal of septage, nightsoil&#13;
and solid waste, cleans streets and operates public latrines. Daily generation&#13;
of solid waste was estimated in 1995 at 320 t/d, of which 250 t/d (440 m3/d) were&#13;
collected by URENCO and 70 t/d was left in the service area, mainly in the back&#13;
street and open spaces which are littered with garbage. A considerable portion&#13;
of waste is organic, recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, metal and glass&#13;
are normally scavenged before collection. The collected waste is disposed of in&#13;
a landfill dump at Thuong Ly (in Hong Bang district). Of the total area of 10 ha&#13;
about 7 ha have been filled up to elevation of 4.0 m above sea level.&#13;
OUANG NINH COMPONENT&#13;
Population&#13;
22.   The component includes Halong City and Cam Pha town, situated along the&#13;
scenic coast in the Quang Ninh province in the Northern Mountains Region of&#13;
Vietnam. With 1994 population of nearly 900,000 and an area of 5,900 km2 Quang&#13;
Ninh is of a medium size among Vietnam's 53 provinces. The province as well as&#13;
the component area are characterized by steep hills with residential locations&#13;
on the low-lands between. The components' 1994 total population was 278,000&#13;
living in 62,000 households.&#13;
23.   Halong City, the capital of the province, acquired city status in 1994&#13;
through merging the towns Hong Gai and Bai Chay, each located on one bank of the&#13;
Dien Vong River estuary. The industries and the administration are mostly in the&#13;
eastern part, Hong Gai, while tourist hotels are in the western part, Bai Chay.&#13;
The 1993 Master Plan projects the City population to grow from the current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54                     ANNEX  1&#13;
124,000 to 510,000 in 2010, mainly through absorbing neighboring districts&#13;
including Cam Pha, and its area to grow from 124 ha to 340 ha in 2010. Cam Pha&#13;
town, with 1994 population of 132,000, is a district capital 20 km east of Halong&#13;
City along the coastal road to the Chinese border 70 km distant. The district is&#13;
dominantly rural with most of the population concentrated around Cam Pha town.&#13;
24.   With about 95% of country's anthracite reserves in the province Halong City&#13;
and Cam Pha town developed into the nations' largest center of coal mining and&#13;
processing. Other industrial activities include shipbuilding, cement production,&#13;
fisheries and seafood processing. Shipping is to be greatly increased through a&#13;
new port for general cargo currently being developed in Dien Vong River estuary&#13;
while the coal port is being moved in Cam Pha. The total labor force was&#13;
estimated in 1994 at 115,000 of which more that 60% were employed in mining and&#13;
manufacturing and the rest in services and administration.&#13;
Water supply&#13;
25.   Water supply services are managed by the Quang Ninh Water Supply Company&#13;
(WSC), a provincial business enterprise, reporting to the Provincial PC through&#13;
its Construction Bureau. It was established in 1976 and re-registered in 1992.&#13;
WSC has 475 permanent employees headed by the Director assisted by two Vice-&#13;
Directors in charge of the Administration Department and the Technical&#13;
Department. Operations of the Water Company are decentralized into six water&#13;
supply enterprises3 and one mechanical workshop unit. Each enterprise is headed&#13;
by a director reporting to the Director of the Company and normally include an&#13;
administration department and several technical teams such as for operating&#13;
treatment plant, pumping stations or distribution network for water supply&#13;
enterprises or for a typical specialization in the workshop unit.&#13;
26.   The 1995 production and distribution capacity of the four water supply&#13;
enterprises included in the component was 51,600 m3/d and the daily average&#13;
production was 28,000 m3/d or 650 lcd, including about 56% of non-revenue water.&#13;
Water services were provided through 13,000 connections to commerce, industry and&#13;
43,200 population (15% of total) of which 9,500 were in Bai Chay, 28,200 in Hong&#13;
Gai and 5,500 in Cam Pha. About 97 e of all connections were residential, using&#13;
about 17% of water supplied and 3 % were commercial and industrial using 27% of&#13;
water supplied. Remaining 56% was non-revenue water.   Private shallow wells,&#13;
estimated to provide about 12,000 m3/d in addition to public supply, are polluted&#13;
and should be considered a temporary source. The projected daily average water&#13;
demand and production capacity assuming 25% of NRW are shown in Table A-1.3.&#13;
27.   The water originates from surface and ground sources. The surface source&#13;
serving Bai Chay is Dong Ho River; an intake and Dong Ho treatment plant with a&#13;
capacity of 20,000 m3/d are 10 km from Bai Chay. The source serving Hong Gai/Cam&#13;
Pha is Dien Vong River; an intake and Dien Vong treatment plant, with a capacity&#13;
3 Water enterprises are: Bai Chai, Hong Gai, Cam Pha, and Dien Vong treatment plant; last two, Uong Bi&#13;
and Mao Khe, are not included in the component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55                     ANNEX  1&#13;
of 15,00 m3/d are about 20 km from Hong Gai. In both instances the facilities&#13;
include intakes formed by a weir across the river, raw water pumping and rising&#13;
main, treatment plant, treated water pumping and rising main. The ground water&#13;
is pumped from thirteen deep wells providing about 1,600 m3/d and 15,000 m3/d to&#13;
Bai Chay and Hong Gai/Cam Pha, respectively. The distribution network consists&#13;
of eighteen balancing reservoirs with the total volume of 22,300 m3, several&#13;
boosting pumping stations, and about 125 km of mains with diameters varying from&#13;
100-800 mm. The tertiary distribution network is practically non-existent. Its&#13;
functions have been replaced by extremely long individual connections (spaghetti&#13;
connections) which draw water directly from mains.&#13;

bl To be determined in later studies&#13;
28.   The water supply works and equipment are in poor state of repair due to low&#13;
quality of materials used for construction, poor initial construction, and many-&#13;
years absence of maintenance. The quality of water supplied is unsatisfactory as&#13;
a result of inadequate treatment and lack of disinfection. Also, supply is&#13;
intermittent, for several hours per day or even for some days during the week.&#13;
29.   A new source of water for Dien Vong treatment plant will be the recently&#13;
completed Cao Van dam about 4.5 km upstream from Dien Vong treatment plant.  The&#13;
dam has been designed to be constructed in two phases of 60,000 m3/d each. The&#13;
dam design and quality of construction have been inspected by an expert in June&#13;
1995; he will continue such inspections annually for the next three years. First&#13;
inspection report is available in the project file.&#13;
Sewerage and drainage&#13;
30.   Sewerage and drainage services in the component area are managed by the&#13;
Halong City Environment and Sanitation Company (ESC) and Cam Pha Town Sanitation&#13;
Company (SC), both administrative enterprises reporting to the city and town&#13;
People's Committee, respectively, through their Urban Departments. In addition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                     ANNEX  1&#13;
to sewerage and drainage, the companies manage street cleaning, solid waste&#13;
collection and disposal, maintain public toilets, cemeteries, public parks and&#13;
street lights. To supplement their resources they also undertake minor&#13;
construction works and develop and operate rental housing. The companies are&#13;
headed by a Director assisted by two Vice Directors, one in charge of sanitation&#13;
and environment and the other in charge of construction, including operation of&#13;
rental housing, and maintenance of street lights. In 1995 the Halong and Cam Pha&#13;
companies had 190 and 170 employees, respectively.&#13;
31.   In 1995, about 82% of households had their own latrine and 10% used public&#13;
latrines while 8% had no access to toilet facilities. There is a shift towards&#13;
construction of pour flush latrines with septic tanks; it can be expected that&#13;
a great number of other types will be converted in very near future.&#13;
32.   Halong and Cam Pha are served by about 53 km of combined sewers.  It&#13;
consists of open channels with minor length of pipework, designed as storm water&#13;
drainage. The channels are normally short and discharge directly in the Halong&#13;
Bay. Due to lack of maintenance a number of channels are completely blocked with&#13;
solid waste, sand and gravel, some of the channel outlets and some length of&#13;
pipework have collapsed, all resulting in surface flow or flooding even during&#13;
average storms. In addition, during low tides the normally submerged drainage&#13;
outfalls are exposed with untreated wastewater flowing slowly on mud flats from&#13;
where various sea food for domestic consumption Ls collected.&#13;
Nightsoil and septage disposal&#13;
33.   The latrines' pits and vaults are typically made smaller than recommended&#13;
and need emptying about four times per year. The septic tanks were constructed&#13;
largely during last two years and have not yet been cleaned. The emptying of pits&#13;
and vaults is normally done by farmers free of charge. On request it is also&#13;
pumped out by the Sanitation Companies which also service public toilets. Sullage&#13;
is typically disposed of directly into drainage channels or into septic tanks.&#13;
Solid waste management&#13;
34.   The solid waste services are managed by the Halong and Cam Pha Environment&#13;
and Sanitation Companies. Daily generation of solid waste in both communities is&#13;
estimated at about 150 t/d (375 m3/d) with a considerable part being organic,&#13;
while recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, metal and glass form a very&#13;
small part. The solid waste collected from households, hospitals and industries&#13;
is disposed of at two waste dumps serving the Halong City and the Cam Pha town.&#13;
Inappropriate disposal of solid waste causes malfunctioning of the drainage&#13;
system, generates breeding of insects and rodents, leads to general environmental&#13;
degradation of the communities and contributes to pollution of Halong Bay.&#13;
DANANG COMPONENT&#13;
Population&#13;
35.   The third largest city in Vietnam and one of the four with provincial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57                     ANNEX  1&#13;
status, Danang city is situated on the coast in central Vietnam about midway&#13;
between Hanoi and HCMC. It has a major deep water sea port and good access to&#13;
communication network through the National Highway #1 and Trans Vietnam railway.&#13;
About 52% of population is working primarily in manufacturing, such as textile,&#13;
and consumption goods, and services sectors such as commerce, transportation,&#13;
tourism and government. A considerable proportion of the labor force, though, is&#13;
in temporary or part-time employment. The city's master plan proposes development&#13;
of tourist resorts along the coast, commercial centers and industrial export&#13;
zones which in aggregate would contribute to increase of current city's GDP from&#13;
US$380 per capita to US$760 per capita in 2000. Beside receiving substantial&#13;
share of the national investment in improving infrastructure, the master plan&#13;
assumes a steady flow of private capital in industry and tourism.&#13;
36.   The city is divided into three districts and further subdivided in 28&#13;
wards. It covers an area of 43,200 ha, excluding the airport and Son Tra&#13;
Mountain. The airport is zoned for national defence purposes and Son Tra Mountain&#13;
with its steep slopes is not suitable for urban development; both are, therefore,&#13;
excluded from the area under control of the city administration. Sector-wise, the&#13;
city administration controls drainage and waste management while water supply is&#13;
controlled by the provincial government.&#13;
37.   The Danang city population of 450,000 in 1995 is expected to grow to about&#13;
500,000 in 2000 due to natural increase and migration. It is planned that after&#13;
2000 the city administrative area will about double and include about eight&#13;
neighboring communes; aggregate population is projected to reach about 680,000&#13;
in 2005 and 765,000 in 2010. The average household of 5.9 persons in 1995 is&#13;
planned to reduce to less than 5 after 2005.&#13;
Water supply&#13;
38.   Water supply services are managed by the Danang Water Supply Company (WSC),&#13;
a provincial business enterprise, reporting to the Provincial PC through its&#13;
Construction Bureau. It has 230 permanent employees headed by the Director and&#13;
assisted by a Chief Accountant and a Vice-Director in charge of the&#13;
Administration Department and the Technical Department, respectively&#13;
39.   The 1995 production and distribution capacity of the WSC system was 40,000&#13;
m3/d and the daily average production was 52,000 m3/d or 270 lcd, including about&#13;
33% of non-revenue water. Water services were provided through 21, 000 connections&#13;
to commerce, industry and 191,000 population (47% of total). About 93% of all&#13;
connections were residential, using about 54% of water supplied and 7% were&#13;
commercial and industrial using 13%. Remaining 33% was non-revenue water.&#13;
Private shallow wells, providing about 12,500 m3/d and serving 40% of population,&#13;
are inadequate and polluted and should be considered a temporary source. The&#13;
projected daily average water demand and production capacity assuming 25% of NRW&#13;
are shown in Table A-1.4.&#13;
40.   The principal water source for Danang is the Cau Do River.  Two separate&#13;
intakes on that river, located about 10 km south of the city center provide raw&#13;
water for treatment plants at Cam Le adjacent to the intakes and San Bay near the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                     ANNEX  1&#13;
airport. Minor supplies are taken from streams on Son Tra peninsula and treated&#13;
in Son Tra two treatment plants.  Cam Le and San Bay plants use conventional&#13;
treatment technology and have capacity of 20,000 m3/d each. Son Tra plants with&#13;
a combined capacity of 5,000 m3/d use only filtration and chlorination and&#13;
provide supply in the Son Tra peninsula only. The distribution network consists&#13;
of a number of smaller reservoirs with the total volume of 15,000 m3, several&#13;
boosting pumping stations, and about 130 km of mains with diameters varying from&#13;
100-900 mm. The tertiary distribution network is practically non-existent. Its&#13;
functions have been replaced by extremely long individual connections (spaghetti&#13;
connections) which draw water directly from mains.&#13;

41.   Sewerage  and  drainage  services  are  managed  by  the  Danang  Urban&#13;
Environmental Company (URENCO), an administrative enterprise, reporting to the&#13;
city's PC through its Construction Bureau. In 1995 URENCO maintained 37 km of&#13;
sewers which operated as combined sewerage system for stormwater and wastewater.&#13;
The system, which serves only about 30% of the urban area, is overloaded and in&#13;
poor state of repair; it discharges into city's lakes and rivers without any&#13;
treatment and the level of maintenance and cleaning is low. The Construction&#13;
Bureau is preparing improvement and expansion of the system.&#13;
42.   In 1995, about 87% of households in the area had their own latrine and the&#13;
remainder had no toilet facilities. There is an observed shift towards&#13;
construction of pour flush latrines with septic tanks and it can be expected that&#13;
a great number of pit latrines will be converted in very near future.&#13;
Nightsoil and septage disposal&#13;
43.   It is estimated that Danang population generates daily about 10,000 t of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59                    ANNEX  1&#13;
septage. Of this quantity, the Danang URENCO and private contractors collect&#13;
about 150 t/d and dispose it at Dai La landfill. The remaining is used as&#13;
fertilizer by owners or collected free of charge by farmers.&#13;
Solid waste management&#13;
44.   The solid waste services and street sweeping are also managed by URENCO.&#13;
In 1995 about 350 ton of solid waste of about 450 ton generated was collected and&#13;
disposed of daily at the Dai La open dump. The rest is burned or buried at source&#13;
or scattered illegally. In addition, URENCO sweeps about 57 km of streets.&#13;

VIETNAM&#13;
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Environmental impact&#13;
Requirements&#13;
1.    The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment (MOSTE) administers the&#13;
Environmental Protection Law (EPL-1993) through its Department of Natural Resources&#13;
and Environment. The Department is also responsible for recommendations on policy,&#13;
rules, regulations, and guidelines, including environmental quality standards, and&#13;
reviewing and approving environmental impact assessments  (EIA) .  The People's&#13;
Committee (PC), assisted by provincial environmental department (DOSTE) is&#13;
responsible for implementing the EPL, including monitoring and enforcement.&#13;
2.    EIAs are required for development projects under the EPL.  Large projects,&#13;
including those with an investment cost of more than US$20 million, must submit an&#13;
EIA to MOSTE for approval. For smaller projects, it is submitted to the DOSTE.&#13;
3.    The project's land acquisition and resettlement would affect a limited number&#13;
of people; most of the other negative impacts are temporary, which would be&#13;
mitigated through good planning and construction practices. According to World Bank&#13;
(WB) guidelines, the proposed project is classified as a category "B" project, which&#13;
requires an environmental management plan (EMP) satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Proiect Description&#13;
4.    The project involves rehabilitation and expansion of water supply facilities&#13;
in Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh, and Danang and will be implemented by the various&#13;
cities' water supply companies (WSCs) from 1997-2001. Details are in Annex 2.&#13;
EIA Studies&#13;
5.    The EIAs were carried out as part of the feasibility studies and the reports&#13;
are available in the project file.  They concluded the project will positively&#13;
affect the living standards and health conditions of the population. Rehabilitation&#13;
of the existing facilities will decrease the level of non-revenue water while&#13;
expansion of treatment plants and transmission and distribution lines will improve&#13;
the quality of water provided and increase the amount of water supply, service&#13;
levels and revenues.&#13;
6.    The project's negative impacts would only be temporary, minor and reversible&#13;
which can be mitigated through proper policy and project planning, public relations,&#13;
and good construction and supervision practices. The engineering preparation of the&#13;
project was guided by the requirement to reduce land acquisition and resettlement&#13;
as much as possible.   Therefore,  the project will require only limited land&#13;
acquisition, relocation of population and demolition of houses.&#13;
7.    Serious  negative  impacts  during  site  clearing,   rehabilitation,  and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
106                         ANNEX 7&#13;
construction of the project facilities are not expected. Most of the WTPs, intakes,&#13;
and other facilities are located far from residential areas. The mountainous area&#13;
in Quang Ninh where raw water mains will be laid and the hill in Danang where the&#13;
WTP will be constructed are degraded and serious impacts on ecology are not&#13;
expected. Construction of the distribution networks will be carried out along the&#13;
roads  and  sidewalks.    While  serious  adverse  impacts  on  residents  are not&#13;
anticipated, consultations with the affected population will be carried out prior&#13;
to construction; in addition, at the design phase, efforts will be made to further&#13;
reduce land requirements.  The standard measures to mitigate the impacts during&#13;
construction, including provision of adequate and safe water during the interruption&#13;
the water services, will be required and included in the bidding and contract&#13;
documents.&#13;
8.    During operation, the WTPs would generate treatment sludge and improved water&#13;
supply would contribute to increasing volumes of wastewater. The sludge would be&#13;
disposed of in sludge retention lagoons in WTPs and when dried, disposed of in&#13;
controlled landfills. Increases in wastewater volumes would have no significant&#13;
impact on the current status; in addition, the sanitation project being prepared in&#13;
the four cities would improve current conditions.&#13;
9.    Serious impacts on water resources are not anticipated since the abstraction&#13;
and pumping rates are relatively small compared to the annual average flow in the&#13;
water resources.   Monitoring of land subsidence and possible contamination of&#13;
groundwater in Hanoi is important, and the program established and carried out by&#13;
the city will be continued.   For Quang Ninh, the safety of Cao Van dam will be&#13;
improved and monitored. Trees and large shrubs in the reservoir were removed before&#13;
filling, to improve the water quality. A program to protect the relevant watersheds,&#13;
water quality at the intakes and in the water supply system against pollution will&#13;
be developed and implemented (see Annex 2).&#13;
Environmental Management Plans&#13;
10.   In line with the EPL, the project's EIAs were cleared by MOSTE.  Also, the&#13;
World Bank requires that, based on the EIAs, the WSCs would prepare an environmental&#13;
management plan (EMP) and a resettlement action plan (RAP) for each component.&#13;
Accordingly, the WB received information on MOSTE's clearance and EMPs for each&#13;
component before appraisal and found them satisfactory.&#13;
11.   The EMPs summarize the mitigation measures proposed for the construction and&#13;
operation of the components and are available in the project file. The measures are&#13;
summarized below and those mitigating the adverse impacts due to land acquisition&#13;
and resettlement are summarized in the next section.&#13;
12.   During construction, the contractors will be required to carry out the works&#13;
according to international standards, including consulting with residents; providing&#13;
safe and adequate temporary paths for residents and businesses; providing adequate&#13;
safety to the public and workers; implementing effective measures to reduce erosion,&#13;
dust, and noise due to construction equipment; providing limited transport and&#13;
construction along the main roads in urban areas during rush hours and in the&#13;
residential areas at night; appropriately disposing of surplus soil and construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
107                        ANNEX 7&#13;
materials; and providing adequate water supply by other means when the system is&#13;
interrupted.   These requirements are included in the bidding documents and the&#13;
contractors will be liable for all damages caused by non-compliance.&#13;
13.   Prior to starting construction, the WSCs will inform the public and residents&#13;
about the project through various means/media and EIA reports will be made available&#13;
for public review. The public relation program will be carried out on a continuous&#13;
basis.  During construction, WSCs assisted by consultants, will cooperate with&#13;
affected residents and take all measures needed to minimize the impacts to the&#13;
residents and public.&#13;
14.   The increase in the quantity of piped water produced would substitute for&#13;
existing non-piped sources leading to minimal net increase in the quantity of&#13;
wastewater generated. Pollution control is planned through a separate sanitation&#13;
project now under preparation.   To ensure adequate protection of water quality&#13;
against pollution at the intakes and in the water supply systems, a monitoring&#13;
program and various investigations will be conducted in each component; terms of&#13;
references for the studies are available in the project file. Training will also&#13;
be provided in the project to ensure effective operation and maintenance of the&#13;
water supply facilities.&#13;
15.   Specific programs for Hanoi, Quang Ninh and Danang systems will also be&#13;
carried out under the project's technical assistance. This includes monitoring&#13;
groundwater and land subsidence in Hanoi; enhancing the safety of Cao Van dam in&#13;
Quang Ninh; and conducting a comprehensive study of Cau Do River in Danang.&#13;
Technical assistance for Hanoi will be financed by the Finnish Government while for&#13;
Quang Ninh and Danang, it will be provided by the Danish and the Australian&#13;
Governments, respectively.&#13;
Land Acquisition and Compensation&#13;
16.   A total of about 36 ha will be acquired of which over one quarter are under&#13;
the responsibility of government agencies. Most of the remaining hectares are rice&#13;
fields; about 30 houses will be removed for the construction of an access road in&#13;
Danang. The land acquisition process will be carried out in line with the national&#13;
laws and appropriate compensation will be paid to the affected families.  Land&#13;
requirements for the project components are given in Annex 2 and summarized in Table&#13;
A-7.1.&#13;
17.   The government policy on land acquisition and compensation was reviewed during&#13;
appraisal and found to be acceptable in principle.   The Land Law (1993), and&#13;
implementation directives issued by the provincial PCs stipulate land categories,&#13;
compensation procedures, and price ceilings for loss of land and property (houses,&#13;
other structures, trees, crops, etc). During the process, representatives of the&#13;
affected families will be included on the compensation committees and will have the&#13;
means to redress grievances.&#13;
18.   The land acquisition process normally takes about 2-3 months and is summarized&#13;
as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108                         ANNEX 7&#13;
* The WSC, consulting with the local government (communes), will carry out a&#13;
field survey identifying the type of land use, number of people affected,&#13;
extent of the impacts, and the estimated amount of compensation;&#13;
* The WSC will submit the survey with the request for land acquisition and a&#13;
proposal for compensation to the Land Service Department (LSD);&#13;
* After receiving the request, LSD will carry out a field inspection,&#13;
confirming the type of land categories, number of the affected population and&#13;
the level of compensation, and submit a recommendation to the provincial PC;&#13;
* The PC will establish a compensation committee, consisting of&#13;
representatives from the WSC, concerned agencies, local PC, and affected&#13;
population to evaluate the adequacy of the compensation and consult/negotiate&#13;
with the affected groups. The committee will submit the results to the PC for&#13;
approval;&#13;
* If agreement is reached, the WSC will compensate the affected people&#13;
directly and the right to use the land will be transferred to the WSC, so&#13;
construction can begin;&#13;
* If the affected families are not satisfied with the decision, they can&#13;
submit their proposals to the  provincial PC for consideration within 15&#13;
days. The PC will respond to the proposal within 1 month;&#13;
* Any land acquisition of more than 5 ha must be approved by the Prime&#13;
Minister's Office.&#13;
Implementation of the EMPs/RAPs&#13;
19.   During appraisal, the compensation policy for each component was reviewed in&#13;
the light of the World Bank policy on resettlement and the WSCs agreed to proceed&#13;
as follows:&#13;
* The proposed EMPs/RAPs presented in the project implementation plans (PIPs)&#13;
will be timely and strictly implemented and results will be periodically&#13;
reported to IDA;&#13;
* During the design stage for the water mains and distribution networks,&#13;
efforts will be made to minimize: (a) the impacts on houses, buildings and&#13;
graves; (b) land requirements; and (c) excavation of large quantities of&#13;
soil. The aim will also be to lay the pipes along the side of roads where&#13;
impacts on households and businesses are less intrusive. Where the damages is&#13;
more serious, pipes will be laid under the roads;&#13;
* Bidding documents will include specific mitigation measures required during&#13;
construction, and the contractors will be liable for damages caused by non-&#13;
compliance;&#13;
* EIAs will be made available for public review; consultation with the public&#13;
and residents will be carried out through various means/media on a continuous&#13;
basis;&#13;
* During construction, the WSC, assisted by consultants, will supervise the&#13;
work and inform residents and the public about all aspects of the project;&#13;
* WSC will be responsible for preparing and implementing the RAP, consulting&#13;
with the affected groups, and carrying out the land acquisition process&#13;
according to national laws. Efforts will be made to ensure that the affected&#13;
population are not worse off after the project, and that their incomes and&#13;
living standards are recovered or improved. The process will be completed at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
109                         ANNEX 7&#13;
least one month before construction begins;&#13;
* The affected assets will be compensated at their replacement value and&#13;
depreciation will not be considered during the calculation;&#13;
* Representatives of the affected population will be included as members of&#13;
the compensation committee to ensure their concerns are adequately addressed&#13;
during the acquisition process and that the level of compensation is&#13;
acceptable;&#13;
* WSC will conduct a detailed survey on the affected population, including&#13;
living standards, level of income, other social conditions, opinions about&#13;
the project component, and the level of compensation and other assistance.&#13;
Farmers loosing more than 25% of their total holdings will be identified, and&#13;
a program to provide assistance will be developed so their economic&#13;
conditions can be reconstituted. Results of the survey, including the level&#13;
of compensation and payment schedule as proposed by WSC and, if possible, as&#13;
agreed with the affected people, will be submitted to IDA for review;&#13;
* Along with the above, WSC will proceed with the formal process and&#13;
incorporate IDA comments; the compensation plan approved by the Government&#13;
will then be submitted to IDA;&#13;
* Land acquisition will be carried out in line with the project&#13;
implementation schedule and will be completed at least one month before&#13;
construction begins;&#13;
Particular Actions&#13;
* In Hanoi, a program to protect groundwater and the water supply system&#13;
against pollution will be prepared and implemented, and the existing program&#13;
to monitor groundwater and land subsidence will be continued;&#13;
* In Haiphong, a program to protect water quality at Quan Vinh intake and the&#13;
water supply system against pollution will be prepared and implemented;&#13;
* In Quang Ninh, a program to strengthen safety at the Cao Van dam and to&#13;
protect water quality at the intakes and in the water supply system against&#13;
pollution will be prepared and implemented;&#13;
* In Danang, details on the land acquisition of the access road from Yen Ne&#13;
intake to the existing WTP at Cam Le will be prepared and submitted to IDA&#13;
for review. Also, a program to study Cao Do River and protect water quality&#13;
at the intakes and in the water supply system against pollution will be&#13;
prepared and implemented.&#13;
During appraisal, the WSCs confirmed the above agreements.&#13;
Government Approval of the EIAs and Compliance&#13;
20.   The EIA reports for the Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang components were&#13;
submitted to MOSTE and the environmental clearances were obtained between August and&#13;
October 1996.  Each implementing agency (WSC) declared its willingness to comply&#13;
with all conditions as required by MOSTE; compliance will be monitored by the&#13;
DOSTEs. The MOSTE and DOSTE capacity, although still limited, is being gradually&#13;
upgraded by the Government, helped by various bilateral grants.&#13;

113                         ANNEX 8&#13;
Outline of the evaluation report on project implementation&#13;
7.    The evaluation report will be prepared by each WSC.  It should not exceed ten&#13;
pages and the performance judgments and analyses should cover the following specific&#13;
aspects:&#13;
(a)   Project  objectives.   A concise  statement  and evaluation of major&#13;
objectives as presented in the SAR, including any changes made during&#13;
implementation.    The  evaluation  will  assess  the  clarity  of  the&#13;
objectives, their realism, and whether they are important for the&#13;
country and sector.&#13;
(b)   Achievement of project objectives.   An assessment of the project's&#13;
success (substantial, partial, negligible) in achieving its major&#13;
objectives - e.g. sector policy improvements, financial objectives,&#13;
institutional development, physical objectives, other social objectives,&#13;
environmental objectives, and public sector management and private&#13;
sector development.&#13;
(c)   Implementation record and major factors affecting the project.   An&#13;
analysis of the factors that affect implementation.   The factors are&#13;
divided into those not generally subject to government or provinces&#13;
control, those subject to government and provinces control, and those&#13;
subject to water companies control.&#13;
(d)   IDA  performance.     An  assessment  of  IDA's  performance   (highly&#13;
satisfactory, satisfactory, deficient) in project identification,&#13;
preparation assistance, appraisal, and supervision.&#13;
(e)   Water companies and provinces performance.   An assessment of the&#13;
performance of involved water companies and provinces (highly&#13;
satisfactory, satisfactory, deficient) in preparing, implementing, and&#13;
operating the project.&#13;
(f)   Assessment of outcome.   A rating of outcome  (highly satisfactory,&#13;
satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or highly unsatisfactory) based primarily&#13;
on how well the project achieved its objectives and how sustainable it&#13;
is likely to be.&#13;
(g)   Future operation.   A description and assessment of the plan for the&#13;
project's future operation, including understanding the measures to&#13;
maximize the project benefits, and the indicators for monitoring and&#13;
evaluating future operations.&#13;
(h)   Key lessons learned.  A discussion of the most significant positive and&#13;
negative lessons learned from the project's implementation, showing how&#13;
they are reflected in the arrangements for its future operations. This&#13;
section also identifies those lessons most relevant to similar ongoing&#13;
and future projects in this sector in Vietnam.&#13;
8.    WSCs will submit the evaluation report to IDA after completing the project and&#13;
in time stipulated in the Project Agreement.&#13;

VIETNAM&#13;
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Assumptions for financial projections&#13;
1.    The financial statement projections are in current Vietnamese Dong (VND)&#13;
Figures for 1994 and 1995 are actual. Local inflation rate of 9% p.a. has been added&#13;
for 1996, 7* for 1997, 6% for 1998 to 1999, and 5% from 2000 to the end of the&#13;
projection period in 2004. The VND exchange rate for the projection period was set&#13;
at VND 11,000 equals US$1.00, and VND 2,100 equals French Francs FFr 1.00.&#13;
HANOI COMPONENT&#13;
Income statement&#13;
2.    Revenues:  Water revenues  have been projected to increase  in line with&#13;
estimated increased water supply and annual increases of water tariffs. Water&#13;
revenues include a 10% surcharge for sewerage. Water supply is projected to increase&#13;
with additional production (30% increase between 1996 and 2001); NRW is projected&#13;
to be 66% in 1996, reducing to 50% in 2000, and to reduce by 1% p.a. thereafter.&#13;
Average water supply and sewerage tariffs are assumed to increase by 12% p.a. from&#13;
1996 to 2001, and by 20% thereafter.&#13;
3.    Operational costs: Staff costs: Include wages, bonuses and other benefits for&#13;
WBC staff. A 4% annual increase in constant prices has been added to pay levels.&#13;
Other costs: Projected expenses are increased in proportion to additional production&#13;
capacity. Depreciation: The calculation of 5.65% p.a. has been made on the weighted&#13;
average of all fixed assets in operation.&#13;
Balance sheet&#13;
4.    Fixed assets: Include network, wells, treatment plants (including land), with&#13;
the addition of plant and equipment when new assets are placed in service. In 1995,&#13;
a valuation of the assets was prepared and used to adjust the value in the balance&#13;
sheet. Accounts receivable: Based on past experience, these have been assumed to&#13;
reduce from 46 days' sales in 1996 to 42 days' in 2004. Inventories: These have been&#13;
assumed to increase in proportion to additional fixed assets in service. Accounts&#13;
payable: Historical figures have been projected to increase in line with operating&#13;
expenses.&#13;
Source and application of funds&#13;
5.    Capital contributions:  Actual and projected  contributions by FINNIDA to&#13;
support the WBC and the project with trainers and advisors; an equity contribution&#13;
towards the project by the Provincial PC of VND 68 billion; additions consist of&#13;
equity contributions by the Government equal to the amount of interest during&#13;
construction included in the cost of the project Loans: The IDA US$32.5 million&#13;
(VND 357.6 billion) credit is assumed to be on-lent to the WBC by the Government&#13;
over 20 years, with a five year grace period, at an interest rate of 6.5% p.a. A&#13;
loan from France of FFr 7.5 million to assist with metering and billing/collections&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
127                         ANNEX 10&#13;
in a pilot area of Hanoi is assumed over 20 years, with a five year grace period,&#13;
at an interest rate of 2.8% p.a.  An additional loan to help fund the follow-up&#13;

VIETNAM&#13;
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Project performance monitoring&#13;
1.          The Monitoring and Evaluation  (M&amp;E)  system is designed to. provide&#13;
managers with information on progress towards project objectives, impact on&#13;
beneficiaries, and institutional, technical and financial aspects that could be&#13;
useful in the commercial operation of the water supply companies. Three basic&#13;
components would be proposed for the M&amp;E system:&#13;
a)    Performance Agreements between the PCs and WSCs;&#13;
b)    Public Performance Audits (PPAs) of WSCs by an independent agency; and&#13;
c)    More traditional tracking of project milestones in terms of measuring&#13;
progress achieved against specific targets in project implementation&#13;
plans.&#13;
Performance Agreements&#13;
2.          Performance Agreements (PA) would be intended to provide incentives for&#13;
the management of WSCs which are state enterprises to improve performance. The&#13;
criteria, their base values and annual targets and weights, and the evaluation&#13;
methodology would be agreed between the PCs and the management of WSCs at the&#13;
beginning of each year. The PA would be closely linked to the Corporate Plan of the&#13;
WSC. Bonus payments would be linked to performance measured against the PA.&#13;
Performance Agreements introduced for state enterprises including WSCs in Thailand&#13;
would be used as the model to be adapted to the specific conditions in Vietnam.&#13;
Public Performance Audits&#13;
3.          An  independent  agency  would  collect  information  on  performance&#13;
indicators of WSCs and make comparative information available for public disclosure.&#13;
The information would include indicators most relevant to consumers such as water&#13;
quality, pressure, reliability, etc. A simple grading system based on color coding&#13;
(e.g., gold for good, green for acceptable, black for unacceptable) would make the&#13;
information easily comprehensible to consumers. Public disclosure of comparative&#13;
information would generate pressure to improve performance and competition amongst&#13;
the water supply companies.&#13;
Project Milestones&#13;
4.          Traditional milestones,  in addition to the above, would be used to&#13;
evaluate project progress by the supervision missions. A detailed list of indicators&#13;
is provided in Table A 11.1 while key performance indicators relevant during project&#13;
implementation, agreed upon during negotiations, are highlighted in Table A 11.3.&#13;
The key performance indicators were identified using the Performance/Risk Summary&#13;
shown in Table A 11.2.&#13;

ANNEX 12&#13;
VIETNAM&#13;
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
Rate of return&#13;
Data&#13;
1.    Data for the "without project" scenario is taken from the WSCs' income statements&#13;
in Annex 9. The base year is taken to be 1995, the last full year for which complete&#13;
accounts are available. Data on water produced, percentage of water billed and average&#13;
tariff are used to compute gross revenues. Operating expenses are adjusted by deleting&#13;
the item for non-collected bills which is not an expense and the item for connection&#13;
charges which would be financed out of the capital budget. For purposes of the rate of&#13;
return computation, the "without project" scenario assumes the 1995 values to remain&#13;
constant in real terms except for operating expenses which are assumed to increase in&#13;
real terms by 0.5% per year due to system deterioration. The base values are shown in&#13;
Table A 12.1.&#13;
2.    For the "with project" scenario, Table A 12.2 shows the project investment costs&#13;
(from Annex 3), excluding price contingencies, and the phasing of annual investment used&#13;
in the analysis. Operating costs are also taken from Annex 9 and projected using 1995&#13;
unit costs for the various cost categories, except staff costs, and multiplying them by&#13;
the amount of water produced in each year. Thus no efficiency gains or economy of scale&#13;
factors are built in. Staff costs are projected to increase at 4% per year in real terms&#13;
reflecting rising real income levels in Vietnam. Both investment costs and operating&#13;
costs are in constant 1995 values.&#13;
3.    No additional water is assumed to be available till 2000. However, non-revenue&#13;
water is projected to begin decreasing earlier as technical assistance focused on&#13;
improved billing and collection will be completed prior to the project becoming&#13;
effective. This is reasonable since administrative losses greatly exceed physical losses&#13;
in WSCs in Vietnam. Tariffs are also assumed to increase from 1997 as this has been&#13;
agreed with the PPCs. The variables are assumed to reach steady state in 2004.&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
4.    For the economic analysis, all costs are expressed in 1995 prices, making no&#13;
adjustments for shadow exchange rate or shadow labor costs in line with the assumption&#13;
made in Power sector projects in Vietnam. Electricity costs are not adjusted as the WSCs&#13;
are being charged 600 VND per kWh which is the long run marginal cost of supply at the&#13;
high voltage level. Staff and electricity costs comprise the bulk of operating costs.&#13;
There is some evidence that prices of chemicals are subsidized to the WSCs. However,&#13;
these are less than 10% of total operating costs and are not adjusted. Rather, any&#13;
likely impact is evaluated through sensitivity analysis on total operating costs. The&#13;
sensitivity results indicate that it is not worthwhile to make adjustments for the&#13;
distortion in the price of chemicals. Household size is taken to be 4.5 in each city.&#13;
Results&#13;
5.    Tables A 12.3, A 12.4 and A 12.5 show the data used, the computations and the&#13;
sensitivity analysis for the FIRR. Tables A 12.6, A 12.7 and A 12.8 are the&#13;
corresponding tables for the EIRR.&#13;

            The aims of the Water Supply Project in
            Hanoi, Haiphong, Halong City/Cam Pha in Quang Ninh, and
            Danang are to: (i) improve the quality of water supply
            services in the four cities through renovation of existing
            facilities in order to satisfy demand up to 2000 of about
            2.5 million people in the cities; (ii) ensure sustainability
            of the physical investments by developing the institutional
            capabilities of water supply agencies, facilitating their
            commercialization, and upgrading their staff skills through
            training; and (iii) assist in preparation of a future
            investment program to satisfy water demand after 2000.  The
            project will include the following components: 1) renewal
            and upgrading of water supply facilities in the urban
            districts of Hanoi, Haiphong and Danang, and Halong/Cam Pha
            in Quang Ninh province; 2) institutional measures to ensure
            sustainability of the physical investments; 3) support
            activities consisting of various studies, advisory services,
            supervision of construction and training; and 4) resettling
            and rehabilitating of population affected by the project.
