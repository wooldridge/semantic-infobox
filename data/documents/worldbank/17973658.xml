&amp;#12;THE WORLD BANK/IFC ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM&#13;
Memorialist: Benjamin B. King&#13;
Date oflnterview: July 24, 1986&#13;
Interviewer: Robert W. Oliver&#13;
Place of Interview: Washington, D. C.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It is July 24, 1986. This is Robert Oliver about to begin a conversation with Mr. Benjamin B.&#13;
King about his distinguished career in the World Bank. May we begin by my asking if you would say a&#13;
bit about your experiences, your career before the Bank, how you came to the Bank, and then, as you&#13;
care to develop it, major points of interest about your career in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I came to the Bank very early in its existence, namely in April1947. My career before&#13;
the Bank had been maiuly military; it was because of a military connection that I came to the Bank.&#13;
What happened was that, towards the end of World War II, I was sent by the RAP Intelligence, which I&#13;
belonged to, which was concerned with codebreaking, to the Pentagon, where I worked with G-2 as a&#13;
liaison officer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     When I went back to England sometime after the war was over, in 1946, I joined one of the few&#13;
development banks that the World Bank had not initiated, which was called the ICFC--Industrial and&#13;
Commercial Finance Corporation--where I spent about a year. And while I was in England an old&#13;
colleague of mine, Bennett Boskey, who is the husband of Shirley Boskey, and who is still my lawyer in&#13;
Washington, came over to England. I think he was working then for the Atomic Energy Commission,&#13;
or whatever it was then. And, as people do in London, he went to the theater and he happened by&#13;
chance to sit next to a mutual acquaintance. He asked the mutual acquaintance where I was to be&#13;
found. The mutual acquaintance told him and he called me up. I took him on a trip to Cambridge and&#13;
we got talking. And he said, "What are you doing?" and so on. And he asked of I had ever heard about&#13;
the International Bank. I said, no, I had never heard a thing about it, it's just an organization. So he&#13;
explained a bit about it and he said, "Well, you know who is the President of it?'' I said, "No".&#13;
&amp;#12;Â·'   B. B. KING                                        -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     [KING]&#13;
     He said, "Eugene Meyer". I said, "Who's he?" He said, "Well, he's Philip Graham's father-in-law".&#13;
     Philip Graham was also working in the Pentagon, in the same unit. So he said, "You might like to think&#13;
     about that". So I called up Philip, and wrote him a letter, and sometime later I got a visit from one of&#13;
     the luminaries in the Bank at that time by the name of Walter Hill.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The process of recruitment at that time was a little bit less formal than it is now. He just said,&#13;
     "Come around to my club and have a glass of sherry and we'll talk'. Subsequently I got a letter offering&#13;
     me a job, at which point all hell broke loose at ICFC and they doubled my salary, so it was very useful.&#13;
     They didn't double it but they said what remarkable prospects I would have there. I wrote back after&#13;
     some heart-searching and said on the whole I thought my prospects had improved considerably in&#13;
     England. But I got another letter sometime later in which the Bank increased its offer by 30 percent.&#13;
     This was an entirely unintentional piece of gamesmanship on my part; I had no ulterior motive and was&#13;
     not expecting the second letter. But I said to myself, well, you know, you cannot play this game too&#13;
     long. So I accepted that offer and I came to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER: I can understand why some people refer to these as the good old days, all the same.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     KING: Anyway, so the princely salary which I was offered, incidentally, at that time I think was&#13;
     something like $5,200 a year. They said, "Of course, we need you here almost immediately," which was&#13;
     certainly not the truth, but they always did. That has not changed since 1947. And so I came by the&#13;
     quickest available means, which in those days was a ship. It was the Queen Elizabeth. But of course I&#13;
     had to get a visa; nobody had thought of G(iv) or G(ii) or G whatever. I went round to the American&#13;
     Embassy and produced a letter saying, look, they've offered me a job and they told me you'll give me a&#13;
     visa. So they said, okay, and they gave me an immigration visa. So I got a Green Card. And what you&#13;
     have to know about a Green Card is that all Green Cards today are blue. And when I come into Dulles&#13;
     or wherever and go to the immigration officer, I think I could get by almost any immigration officer&#13;
     with anything I ever wanted to because as soon as they see my Green Card they say, 'I've never seen&#13;
     one of these."&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                          -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING)&#13;
     Anyway, I still have the Green Card. I remember that I injured my back, and did not arrive on the&#13;
due date. But then I came down to Washington and joined the Economics Department, which was&#13;
then under Leonard Rist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Apart from your military career, you must have had some career as an economist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No career as an economist except at the ICFC. I just studied it at Cambridge, that's all. I had&#13;
no career.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But you had a Cambridge degree.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I had a Cambridge degree, yes, which was mostly mathematics; mathematics and economics. I&#13;
joined the Economics Department and to the best of my recollection--I don't know that I have any&#13;
personal record of this left--one of the frrst tasks I was set to doing was examining, with others--I was&#13;
the neophyte--the debt record of the previous disaster in the 1930s. I confess I remember very little&#13;
about this except that we looked into the history of it. Presumably it had some relevance to the whole&#13;
issue of what the Bank might want to do on creditworthiness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, it surely had a lot to do with the drafters of the Articles of Agreement specifying that&#13;
the loans were to be primarily for projects because they felt that the debts of the 1930s were defaulted&#13;
to the extent they were in part. ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, but that issue had already been cast in concrete in the Articles of Agreement and even&#13;
Keynes' speech, at Bretton Woods, shows they'd already looked at that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I cannot recall exactly, but I just remember that this was the first job I had to do. I cannot recall&#13;
what interesting document came out of this process. But there were a lot of people engaged in looking&#13;
at this particular debt record at the time. And so that was my frrst real experience at the Bank. That&#13;
was in 1947, early 1948.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you stay in Economics clear up until the reorganization of 1952?&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: To the best of my recollection, yes, except for a year or so in the Office of the President.&#13;
Although I did work on a particular subject area which had regional significance and I worked for a&#13;
time on Africa. I think this was before the reorganization. In other words, there was specialization of a&#13;
regional nature within the Economics Department to go with the specialization within the Loan&#13;
Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I remember one of the first reports I wrote--in November 1949--was on the British policies&#13;
connected with economic development. I looked into the various colonial and development acts and&#13;
the history of those and what the implications were and how these economies of the then colonial&#13;
empire fitted in with the U.K. I did this because one of the issues which came up fairly early on was&#13;
the question of lending to then British colonies, and what the creditworthiness issues were; would they&#13;
be guaranteed by the British Government, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The first operational mission, for example, that I went on--this was after the reorganization--was to&#13;
the Rhodesias. We had at that time come to the conclusion that although we would make loans which&#13;
were supported by the creditworthiness of the metropolitan government, we should insist that loans&#13;
were made within what weÂ·considered to be creditworthiness limits of the actual borrowing&#13;
government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: So Britain co-signed, so to speak, a loan in what is now Zimbabwe, but Zimbabwe had to&#13;
have the creditworthiness to support the loan on its own?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, this was actually Zambia but the same thing applies. Yes. And the same thing happened&#13;
in what was then the Belgian Congo, Zaire. There were really a variety of things that I did before the&#13;
reorganization. It seems to me that people might just get assigned to particular questions which would&#13;
come up, questions which now have practically no meaning, which were then of considerable&#13;
importance. Those were concerned with the 18 percent contribution that members made in their own&#13;
currency, many of which were not freely convertible, and there were many issues of interpretation of&#13;
the Articles of Agreement which came up which I may be able to document. I even remember reading&#13;
those two green volumes about Bretton Woods in order to trace the meaning of Article IV (3) and how&#13;
it developed, because it started with an American version of the British version. Many things did&#13;
because these were then two.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You mean the U.S. Department of State publication. I went through the same exercise for&#13;
my dissertation. I should have given you my dissertation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. In one case you could trace the development and in a sense prove what the meaning of a&#13;
particular clause had to be, from the historical development, from version 1 to version Sa, or whatever&#13;
it might have been.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: A Ms. [Antonia) Macedo in the legal department of the Bank has been doing the same&#13;
thing all over again for about a year now, so that these questions continue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, of course there was the issue of who would be repaid in what form. You know, it talks&#13;
about gold and convertible currency, the issue of who would get it. The question is whether you could&#13;
expect to lend your inconvertible currency and get convertible currency back. And there were many&#13;
tricks that were said to be being played, such as borrowing inconvertible currency so you could keep, if&#13;
you were the borrower, your convertible currency. There were arguments between the borrower and&#13;
the country whose currency was being lent. And these sorts of issues came up, and although I don't&#13;
think any terribly esoteric economic questions arose out of them, one spent a lot of time on these issues&#13;
because so many currencies were inconvertible that this was a constant issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Besides writing pieces about the economies of various countries, these were some of the issues&#13;
that, as far as I can see, are now mainly of archeological interest because there are very few&#13;
inconvertible major currencies left.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, did you remain in the Economics Department through the whole of the 1950s?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no. The world was divided into three departments of operations with the reorganization.&#13;
There was Western Hemisphere, Asia and Middle East, and a mouthful called Europe, Africa and&#13;
Australasia. But at some point in the interim, I had two other jobs. One job was to spend a year or so&#13;
in the office of the President, Eugene Black, starting in October 1949. My immediate boss was Dick&#13;
[Richard H.) Demuth. There were two main things that I did at that time. I was responsible for&#13;
overseeing the drafting of the Fifth Annual Report, which made a number of policy statements which&#13;
were somewhat different from the earlier reports. The second thing I did was to write speeches with&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                          -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
Black. The experience I'd had in learning about indebtedness was useful, because one of the speeches&#13;
was about that, so I knew about the sources. But the greatest personal triumph I had in writing&#13;
speeches for Mr. Black was that I concluded one of them with a quotation from Abraham Lincoln.&#13;
And I had the great satisfaction of having a large number of Americans call in to ask for its source.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Probably the second inaugural address.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I'd have to look it up, I still have it. As you can imagine, I had a fair amount to do with Black&#13;
at the time. I know that you're interested in relationships with Presidents. And to me he was an&#13;
extremely easy-going person, very easy to get along with. I had been in the Bank three or four years&#13;
and he was, you know, a "Georgia peach," as the press called him. When I had done a draft I'd show it&#13;
to Dick Demuth, and he would send it on. Black would call me in and so we'd go over it. He might&#13;
question one word, or ask for the explanation of what I had said in one paragraph and that was it. That&#13;
was speech writing in those days. Nobody cleared anything with anybody. It was an utterly informal&#13;
and totally painless occupation except for possibly the typist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Wasn't Harold Graves nominally in charge of...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think that was pre-Graves. This must have been early 1951, I guess. Something like that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: So you were still nominally in the Economics Department?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, I was actually seconded for a year to work in the Office of the President. My pay check&#13;
would come in, marked Office of the President. The office consisted of Demuth and a Guatemalan&#13;
named Enrique Lopez-Herrarte, who represented the Bank at the UN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you then go back to research after that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Nominally I went back until the reorganization came along, but in fact most of 1951 was taken&#13;
up by a large survey mission to Iraq. The other thing I had to do was sometimes write papers for the&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING)&#13;
Bank in response to questions which were coming up at the UN. The UN at that time was full of rival&#13;
initiatives. I mean it has had them since, but there were all sorts then. Although I personally do not&#13;
really know about this, I suspect there was also a sort of power play: the original issue of how much the&#13;
Bank was subject to the UN was still an issue at that time. And they liked to have committees which&#13;
would tell the Bank what they thought the Bank ought to be doing. I wrote some various things along&#13;
those lines and on one occasion was quoted with tremendous approval in the Wall Street Journal,&#13;
which may have been the last time the Bank has been referred to favorably in the Wall Street Journal.&#13;
I think that actually happened even earlier, in May 1949. One could get seconded for this kind of a job&#13;
more or less wherever one was.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I also remember working with some people in the Legal Department on the idea of an IFC&#13;
[International Finance Corporation], working on drafts of proposals in March 1950, quite some time&#13;
before the fmal draft. And I did whatever was on the plate, really. That's what it was, and speeches&#13;
were one of the main things. The Annual Reoort was certainly a big slice of it because it took quite a&#13;
lot of organizing and writing. But otherwise it was, you know, very a Ia carte. It was a question of&#13;
whatever came up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I'm interested in getting us to India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, well, you have to go through Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: All right, let's go through Mrica.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â·KING: Actually, the second thing that I did before this was to go on one of the Bank's frrst survey&#13;
missions. I spent three months in Iraq in 1951. I don't think there is an immense amount to be said&#13;
about that. It was an interesting experience. It was one of the Bank's early survey missions, the volume&#13;
has been published. My part in it was not wholly insignificant but not highly significant, uuless you're&#13;
particularly interested in Iraq.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was it a large mission?&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, it was one of these monumental missions which they had, which were the fashion of the&#13;
time. There was one to Nigeria; Colombia was a big one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Cuba was a big one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, Cuba, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And Iraq was equally big?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Iraq was quite big and the Swedish Governor of the Central Bank was the leader of it, who was&#13;
a very nice man. I have been on one other large mission which was in many ways much more&#13;
interesting but far more divisive than this one. The Iraq mission was a very pleasant, interesting&#13;
experience; it was the first real mission I ever went on for the Bank. There was three months of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     And then I went to the Department of Operations - Europe, Africa and Australasia where my first&#13;
operational mission was toÂ· what was then the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. I wrote a report&#13;
which now I think would astonish anybody who would think that you could write a report on three&#13;
separate countries in about 25 pages. It was considered sufficient at the time. And the only notable&#13;
thing I think about this experience was that we made a loan for considerably less than was asked for to&#13;
what was then Northern Rhodesia--it's now Zambia--because the price of copper was very high and&#13;
they really had quite a lot of money. We said you better wait until a rainy day when it's a bit more&#13;
useful to borrow it. I compared what I had said in some of the documents at that time, which was 1952,&#13;
with a report 17 years later in the Bank and found an incredible identity of language. The Bank was&#13;
still saying the same things about the same country in almost the same language. I don't think it was&#13;
plagiarism, I think they just...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Maybe there were identical persons on the mission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, they were very, very different people. Which reminds me of the story of the British army&#13;
unit walking around in the dark and the rain in France during World War I. They come to a sigu which&#13;
says Avranches 5 kilometers. And two hours later they come to another sign that says Avranches&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                          -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
5 kilometers, and one poor, tired, wet Tommy says, "Well at least the bloody place ain't gaining on us."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Very good!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: But the interesting thing about this again was, I think, the extraordinary independence one had&#13;
at the time. The mission consisted of three people: Mike [Michael L.] Lejeune, who can tell you about&#13;
it, was the leader of the mission; I was the economist; and we had a retired Army Corp of Engineers&#13;
general named J. C. Mehaffy who was an extraordinarily nice man. There were the three of us, and we&#13;
went around three countries in probably as many weeks. I think we virtually came and formed our own&#13;
decisions as to what the policy of the Bank should be in this case. I said a certain amount of money had&#13;
been requested, but we were going to make less available in the field, and I do not recall having the&#13;
slightest doubt that this would be accepted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Back in Washington, you mean?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, that's right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you have the feeling that you had almost ld!!1!: blanche to negotiate an increase as well&#13;
as a decrease, or were you doing specific projects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I think there were obviously limits on our ability to increase it. If somebody asks you for&#13;
$10 million, you obviously don't have carte blanche to go up to $100 million. But I just had the feeling&#13;
that there was a great deal of independence. You could always be overruled, but the onus of proof that&#13;
you were wrong was on them, really. And also the other thing that I can remember, which we&#13;
discussed at lunch, was that I did have a lot of time to prepare for this mission. I collected a large&#13;
number of documents, the accounts of Northern Rhodesia, the accounts of Nyasaland and this fund&#13;
and that fund and so on and so forth, and I had enough time to master them. So when I talked to the&#13;
Finance Secretary and the Governor of Northern Rhodesia, as they were, as they would say, "But we do&#13;
not have this," and I said, "Well, how about this particular fund?" I don't say I knew more about it than&#13;
the Secretary of F"mance, but I certainly by that time knew more about it than the Governor, which put&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(KING]&#13;
him in a somewhat less strong position than he might have been otherwise. I do not say that I had&#13;
done any sort of miracle of mastery of this particular subject, it just was that I had a couple of months&#13;
to do nothing else but study all this; I could do it. But I don't think you have the time to do that in the&#13;
Bank today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: There was as I recall a particularly good British-directed statistical office in Salisbury for&#13;
the whole Federation in the period you're now talking about.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That is absolutely correct. As a matter of fact, one man who was there carne to the Bank,&#13;
Tommy (C. H.] Thompson. It was a very good office. But I was really talking less about the statistics&#13;
of those two than I was about the rather complicated and incestuous system of accounting, because a&#13;
lot of the colonial accounting consisted of taking money out of one particular pocket and transferring it&#13;
to another pocket. And unless you really found out what all these pockets were like, when you added&#13;
them together and crossed out contra items on one side or another, you could easily be diddled. And&#13;
indeed this was the objective. Godfrey Huggins, who was then Lord Malvern and who was the first&#13;
Prime Minister, indeed confessed that a lot of what they were doing was done in order to confuse the&#13;
electorates, for good reasons. I mean, he really did not want to spend a lot of money, he wanted to&#13;
make people believe that when things were going well, he had less money than he had. I mean, he just&#13;
sort of salted it away in something called a reserve account of some kind. But my impression is that&#13;
this luxury, if I may call it, of being able to read up on what was going on in detail no longer exists, has&#13;
not existed for qnite a long time in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: It existed in the 1950s in part because the amount of funds that the Bank had available for&#13;
lending purposes was not large, so there was no good spending a whole lot of time looking for projects.&#13;
Is that not fair to say?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I think that had something to do with it, but one would have to see a chart with the number of&#13;
people who were doing these things, against the number of projects. And both of them have gone up&#13;
qnite a bit. I don't know what the man-project ratio is. It would have to be a man-project ratio&#13;
because inflation has also come into it that you would have to look at.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -11-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Projects became bigger as well as more expensive as time went on. People in the Bank&#13;
today frequently say that staff is not too large because the people per dollar spent have not increased.&#13;
Indeed, they say, they've decreased some in the last year or so, or perhaps longer ago than that. It&#13;
seems to me, on the other hand, that since the Bank has been in the business of lending for a much&#13;
longer period of time, it doesn't have to learn so much. Therefore there ought to be a fair amount of&#13;
more standardization of processes which ought to reduce the number of people required per project, at&#13;
least for projects that are of a well established nature. So I guess it can be argued both ways as to&#13;
whether staff is now large or not, compared to whatever criterion one uses. But you're making the&#13;
point that in those days the. staff was large enough, relative to its project works, so that there was the&#13;
luxury of some time for thinking and gathering information?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Much more so I think than at present. I mean, I'm not saying that the product was more&#13;
profound. On the contrary, we were probably much more naive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It also strikes me today that people are obliged to spend more time in committee meetings&#13;
because there are a larger number of people who have to know a common thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's right, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That is in a way a subtraction from the total amount of time spent as far as productive&#13;
activity is concerned. That's a big aside, I didn't mean to interrupt you.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no, I appreciate these asides because they help to make one; recall these things. Since I&#13;
was involved in Africa, that was the only visit I made to that particular part of Africa. I subsequently&#13;
went to what was then known as the Gold Coast--it's now Ghana--a couple of times, where I&#13;
encountered Sir Robert Jackson. He was the husband of Barbara Ward, and he was subsequently with&#13;
a big project in the UN over what was the Volta River project. My recollection of the Ghanaian&#13;
trip--which was concerned with both the economy of the country and the prospect of a loan for a&#13;
massive aluminum project on a scale unprecedented in those days in West Africa--again was of a&#13;
remarkably small scale mission consisting of three people. We left Paris, or London I guess, in a slight&#13;
state of trepidation on the part of at least one member of the mission, because we were going through&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING)&#13;
Tripoli in Libya at exactly the time when the French, British and Israelis had invaded Suez. And the&#13;
mission consisted of a Frenchman, a Briton and an American of Jewish extraction. We thought we&#13;
would be ideal hostages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But the hostage business hadn't really started yet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, they were not in full swing at the time and all we had was the discomfort of sitting for&#13;
about half an hour at the airport before we went on to Ghana. But again I had the impression of a&#13;
great deal of independence of action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There is one incident which I think suggests that we were not so wholly naive and unsophisticated&#13;
in those days as perhaps people think. This is a story about one of my colleagues, Sam [Samuel)&#13;
Lipkowitz. It was not clear initially what each of us was responsible for, but it was agreed that he&#13;
would be responsible for the study of the cocoa industry, which was by far the biggest and most&#13;
important in Ghana then and probably still is now. I think before the mission he knew nothing about&#13;
cocoa except that it was something that went into a Hershey bar. But he studied it. We went to Ghana&#13;
and at one point a gentleman by the name of Cadbury, who comes from of course the well-known&#13;
chocolate firm--we met him and had discussions--and this colleague of mine had an argument with him,&#13;
a friendly argument. My colleague argued that the crop would be bigger and Cadbury arguedÂ·that it&#13;
would be less, or vice versa. They fmally ended up by having a bet. And Cadbury said that if he was&#13;
wrong he would send my colleague a tie. My colleague got the tie. And he was not dealing with an&#13;
unsophisticated man, but somebody who knew the cocoa industry inside out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We also traveled a great deal in the country. In fact, one of our greatest achievements was to be&#13;
able to tell almost anybody in a crowd that we had been to places which they had never even thought of&#13;
going to. And this was a very interesting time. It was during the transition period from the British&#13;
colonial period to independence. The then Governor, Arden Clarke, was the last Governor. It was the&#13;
time [Kwame) Nkrumah was going to take over. But again I would say there was this issue of timing of&#13;
lending. And I think our position was more accepted when we got back~ This was my main visit to&#13;
Ghana.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        Â·13Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
    That was the last I had to do with Africa, but I was still in the same department. I switched to&#13;
Scandinavia, and my next missions were concerned with Norway. I made two trips to Norway. As a&#13;
matter of fact, I have to correct that. In between was something of even greater interest, although&#13;
nothing came of it, which was three missions to Germany in one year. The West German Government&#13;
wanted to borrow some money. We had intense negotiations about it, and the whole thing foundered&#13;
on a rather esoteric question of interpretation of the clauses in the Dawes and Young loans to West&#13;
Germany. The Bank wanted to have at least a .l!l!ri .l!liW! position, and there was a question of whether&#13;
this was consistent with the provisions of Dawes and Young loans. I remember having discussions with&#13;
Hermann J. Abs, who was a great figure in Germany. We discussed this in terms of all loans being&#13;
equal, but some loans being more equal than others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Nothing very much came of that except that there was a rather charming incident, again in the&#13;
presidency of Mr. Black who arrived in Germany for the third of these missions that I was on. We&#13;
went one morning to a meeting at some appointed building in Bonn and for some reason we couldn't&#13;
get in. It was closed or we arrived early or something. So we sort of hung around in the street, and&#13;
there was a young boy with a bicycle. Black went up to the young boy, and in what way he did it I'm&#13;
not quite sure, but he somehow got the boy to lend him the bicycle. The boy, it seemed to me, was&#13;
extremely suspicious and didn't particularly care for it, but was prevailed upon by Black to lend him the&#13;
bicycle. At which point, in order to pass the time, Black bicycled up the street and back again, and, to&#13;
the relief of the boy, gave the bicycle back to him. This was the sort of man he was.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was he wearing a bowler hat at the time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well he, he could have been. It didn't make much difference. He took this kid's bike and just&#13;
pedaled up the street and pedaled back--there was not much traffic in Bonn in those days--and&#13;
returned the bike and was rather pleased with himself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That's a marvelous story.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Going around Germany and meeting all the leading bankers and various people was an&#13;
interesting time, but of course, the whole thing was totally frustrated by this legal impasse.&#13;
Subsequently I had to write a report on West Germany's prospects at the time. Fortunately I thought&#13;
that they were reasonably good, but writing a creditworthiness report on Germany in 1953...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: There's some risks involved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, there were a lot of downside risks on that. It was then that I switched, from Iraq to&#13;
Southern Africa to West Africa to Germany to Norway. The missions we went on to Norway were&#13;
usually of two or three people. We made two successive loans to Norway and one of these loans was&#13;
for a hydroelectric project. The other loan was ostensibly for shipping--or the one the previous year&#13;
had been for shipping--and it wasn't really. It was used as a kind of bogus vehicle. And the second&#13;
time a repeat loan came along, the Norwegians just wanted to borrow money. I again said, well, why&#13;
do we go through this? Really, they just want to import more than they could otherwise, yes. Well why&#13;
not say so. And I thought in a way this was a sort of an early structural adjustment loan or whatever.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I take it that you were there in what might have been called the pre-investment&#13;
investigation, but the projects were being suggested by the Government rather than by representatives&#13;
of a projects department from the Bank. You were bringing back information about the Government's&#13;
suggestions of various projects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. Well, I had nothing to do with with the first one, which was this bogus shipping loan. For&#13;
the second one we simply said this is just for imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But the point is the Government was making the proposal rather than the Bank, as it tends&#13;
to do today?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's right. The second one I was concerned with was for a hydroelectric project, and that&#13;
was a very specific project which had indeed been suggested by the Norwegian Government. It was a&#13;
very large one. We again had a smallish mission of three people: an engineer, myself, and a younger&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -15-&#13;
&#13;

[KING]&#13;
economist. Also I had a dual role as economic advisor of the department and head of the division&#13;
dealing with Scandinavia. Things were concluded with reasonable dispatch. This was perhaps more&#13;
interesting than many other loans. I take that back. The first of the two was more interesting than&#13;
many other loans because it was the second of its kind, a joint issue with the U.S. capital market. In&#13;
other words, there was a Bank loan and an issue of Norwegian bonds with Harriman Ripley as the lead&#13;
house on Wall Street. And so we were conducting a joint operation with the U.S. capital markets. We&#13;
had to make up a schedule of legislation to be passed by the Storting [Norwegian Parliament] and write&#13;
an economic report. The technical people did various reviews of the project and there were problems,&#13;
relocation problems, so I stayed there for that. And, I don't know, all this was done in a few months&#13;
with a few people and one or two visits to New York.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was the term "co-financing" used in connection with this arrangement?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no. It's very strange. The reason I think that happened was because--what happened was&#13;
initially the reconstruction part of the Bank-- you see, there were loans, you know, to France and&#13;
Luxembourg and Denmark and then, these loans to Australia, Norway and other developed countries,&#13;
not to speak of Japan--where the idea was that they should be weaned back to the capital markets&#13;
where they belonged. In the case of Norway there were Norwegian bonds existing. The first country&#13;
was Belgium. That was the idea, and the Articles of Agreement say that, if there's another...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: If private funds are available, the Bank's not supposed to lend.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, the idea was that private funds might not be available right away for Norway. But if the&#13;
Bank was endorsing the project--the bonds were not guaranteed by the Bank, it was an entirely&#13;
separate issue--this was a way of gradually accomplishing that gual of getting these emerging countries&#13;
to get back from being clients of the Bank to being clients of the capital market. The Bank has a&#13;
jargon for that now, I've forgotten what it is.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think that didn't finally happen for Norway until George Woods' administration, when he&#13;
insisted that loans the Bank made to Norway and other such countries had to be on commercial terms&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                          -16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[OLIVER]&#13;
precisely. In other words, the Bank could not lend to Norway at a slightly lower, even a half percent&#13;
interest rate, than Norway could get from floating bonds in the private market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That may well be.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, is it time to talk about India?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Any time, yes, bec~use I think that after Norway I guess that was pretty well the end of my&#13;
operational career for quite some time. I went to the EDI [Economic Development Institute] for&#13;
several years and it was not long after I left the EDI that I went to India. We can forget the ED I. If&#13;
you ever want to come back to it I will be perfectly happy to, but. ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 LIVER: I want to be sure I have some of the stories you told me at lunch about your experience in&#13;
India on the record. We can come back to EDI if you'd like.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, shortly after I had come back to the Bank from what was then called the country club&#13;
atmosphere of the EDI, I was asked by [Sir] Geoffrey Wilson if I would consider becoming Resident&#13;
Representative of the Bank in India, a job which had previously existed, but where there was an&#13;
interreguum because the previous incumbent had left and they had not appointed a new one for some&#13;
time. And after some consideration and a small condition on my part that I would be allowed to make&#13;
the preliminary trip in order to make personal arrangements, I said would do this. The highlights of&#13;
my recollections on this experience are, first of all, I was invited to go and call on the Indian&#13;
Ambassador at the time who was B.K. Nehru. And we had a pleasant little chat and he said, "Of&#13;
course you understand that the Resident Representative of the Bank in Delhi, his job is to be the eyes&#13;
and ears of the Bank." I said, "Yes, I hear what you say." I don't remember whether it was articulated&#13;
or not articulated, but it was very clear that what he meant was not that I was to be the eyes and ears of&#13;
the Bank, but that I was not to be its mouth. I mean, this was not a positive statement, it was a&#13;
well-concealed negative statement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I understand. Put in a very diplomatic way.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -17-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. Well, that I think was my ftrst indication of what were to he a series of conflicts of many&#13;
kinds during what was a very interesting period. When I got to India, the ftrst thing that happened to&#13;
me unfortunately was I was on a Bank mission and contracted hepatitis so that I was hors de combat&#13;
for some time. But gradually over a period of time I decided that I had to interpret my role in India as&#13;
it made sense to me. And I think there were really two main respects in which this occurred. The ftrst&#13;
one was to get much more involved in project work. What used to happen was that people would come&#13;
through from the Projects Department--it was a single department in those days--and would hardly&#13;
touch base in Delhi except to ask us to get them a hotel room. Their project would be in Calcutta or&#13;
wherever. And then they would go back and write a report and echo the complaints, which were not&#13;
uncommon, of their colleagues in Calcutta, Bombay, Madras or wherever, about the impossibility of&#13;
doing business with the central government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And so one of the things I said was, you know, this is quite idiotic because they are not stupid in&#13;
Delhi at all. If these people hear of problems that the Port of Calcutta has or whatever, and if they&#13;
seem to he reasonable problems, I can arrange a meeting with the Ministry of Fmance. I know the&#13;
man who runs it quite well, and we can discuss it. Maybe we can make some sort of inroads on an&#13;
otherwise useless performance. And so I got to know a number of the projects people and I found&#13;
them perfectly reasonable; they seemed to he rather glad of this iuitiative and that was one thing. Mind&#13;
you, since there had not been a Resident Representative for some time, it was not surprising that they&#13;
didn't do this; there was nobody to do it for them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The second thing was that I conceived it as part of my job to consider a number of policies of the&#13;
Indian Government on various projects that they had in mind and discuss them. A young Italian&#13;
colleague came out to join me, and he and I were virtually of the same mind on most things. We&#13;
decided to look into the implications of the way the admiuistrative machine works. And, you know, we&#13;
discovered all sorts of strange things, particularly my Italian colleague, who succeeded in being well&#13;
connected. For example, there were repeated loans to the railways. We would hear one story of what&#13;
was happening in the development of the railways from the railway admiuistration and another one&#13;
from the port administration. But there was a suggestion of a port loan for Haldia, which is an&#13;
alternative to Calcutta. And we said, "Well, look, on the one hand we're going to carry coal to&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -18-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(KING]&#13;
south India; on the other hand, the railways which are supposed to use the coal say they're going to&#13;
dieselize; so which is it?" My Italian colleague did an exhaustive study of iron ore exporting, because&#13;
they wanted a loan for equipment to export iron ore. We found all sorts of strange things going on&#13;
such as long hauls, cross hauls, and we started taking these things up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Out of this experience, which gradually began to contravene B.K. Nehru's thesis that the Resident&#13;
Representative should he the eyes and ears of the Bank but not its mouth, a kind of rather&#13;
controversial situation began to arise. Two very distinct points of view began to develop within the&#13;
Bank; one felt that the Consortium meetings which took place annually were a kind of theatrical show&#13;
in which the Bank wrote a report and everybody was asked to contribute money--perhaps this&#13;
description of the process is somewhat of a caricature. And the other extreme felt that the Bank&#13;
should be very much tougher and more insistent on at least a serious discussion of changes in policy or&#13;
more rational behavior or at least fuller information for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: May I interrupt to ask two questions?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: When was the Consortium originally established?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: In 1958, although it was not called that originally. I got to India in 1%3 and there already had&#13;
been Consortium meetings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And the other question is, had there been established consultative groups, as became rather&#13;
popular later on?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: The consultative croup was a country cousin of the consortiums which were established for&#13;
India and Pakistan, which preceded the consultative groups formed for other countries. The&#13;
consultative group was a slightly bush-league consortium.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It sounds to me like you were proposing that the Consortium become something of a&#13;
consultative group, in addition to being a consortium.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well I thought that the Bank ought to play a much more positive role in asking for a quid pro&#13;
quo. It was not the Bank's job to just raise money; it was the Bank's job to raise money and ask for&#13;
certain changes in policy. Asking questions was a perfectly legitimate thing, and if there were people in&#13;
India who were representatives of the Bank they were just as entitled to ask questions and to raise&#13;
questions as anybody else.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But it wasn't primarily because the Indians were seeking advice from outside experts, so&#13;
much as that they were simply answering questions posed by the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: On behalf of the Consortium and itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, you know, here were two people, and ultimately three people, who were representatives&#13;
of the Bank in India. We conceived it as our job to understand what we could about a variety of issues&#13;
in the Indian economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I understand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I mean, of course there were other things like this coal transport mission which was a separate&#13;
thing organized in the Bank which Professor [Edward S.] Mason was on and Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell,&#13;
as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think that's right, I think he was.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: And Dale Hekhuis. We conceived ourselves as being there to find out things, to raise&#13;
questions about the running of the Indian economy, which we thought ought to at least be discussed.&#13;
And a number ofthem didn't like it. I think, my guess is at least--I know this is true to a very limited&#13;
extent--that there were people who welcomed this in India. But of course there were probably more&#13;
who did. not welcome it and thought that we specifically, and anybody in the Bank who did this sort of&#13;
thing, were exceeding our authority, were going too far.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                       -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You were interfering in the internal affairs of a member nation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: It even got beyond that. I think that Chester Bowles, who was then U.S. Ambassador, even felt&#13;
that things which came out of the Delhi office which.... We talked to the people at the U.S. Embassy,&#13;
but Chester Bowles wanted to have rose-colored spectacles. I knew the wife of a member of his staff&#13;
who produced a volume of photographs of India. He didn't like one of them because there was a dead&#13;
donkey in one comer or something, and it became quite an issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    One time I proposed that instead of the Bank producing a report on the Indian economy for the&#13;
Consortium meeting, that the Indian Government should produce the report, their own report, on how&#13;
they saw it and what problems there were and what should be done. It would be the Bank's job, and&#13;
the Consortium's, to raise questions about it. That was done one year. To my recollection that had&#13;
never been done before or"since. But I'm not so sure it isn't a wonderful idea. If you have structural&#13;
adjustment loans you should get the country to analyze its own politics. They can do it. Let them use&#13;
any help they like, get Bank fmance people to work for them, but let them figure it out for themselves&#13;
and then comment on it. That's more instructive than having the Bank do it. And this was an issue,&#13;
right throughout the time I was in India. And although I would not go into any details about it, this&#13;
caused considerable acrimony and a little bit of playing one side against the other. This was probably&#13;
happening on both sides of the fence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Were the sides only within the Indian Government, or were there also sides within the&#13;
World Bank itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, the sides I knew about, of course, were mostly within the World Bank itself. There were&#13;
certainly sides within the Indian establishment. I knew people who said, "You're quite right to question&#13;
these things, and what's more the World Bank is derelict if it's not doing that." Now, there weren't&#13;
many of those, but there were people who encouraged me within the Indian establishment. Now&#13;
people in the Indian Government per se--not really, but then of course how can you blame them. I&#13;
mean, they didn't want to be out of a job. But there were people who were reasonably encouraging, I&#13;
would say, inside the Indian Government. It was a time in which the question of how much the Bank&#13;
should be doing for India and how much India should be doing for itself was a major issue. I think&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -21-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(KING]&#13;
it is entirely possible--but since I was in India and wasn't in Washington I don't know--that it was a&#13;
result of tbis erupting controversy--and how much of it reached George Woods I have no idea--that&#13;
something like tbe BeU Mission was proposed. As I told you, Escott Reid one time offered the&#13;
leadership of it to me, which I turned down.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: We might identify Escott Reid. He was tben head of tbe Soutb Asia and Middle East&#13;
Department?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's right, yes. And he's been made an Ambassador to India, or High Commissioner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sandy [Alexander] Stevenson was his deputy?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, tbat's right. And tbe people working on India were Peter Wright, Greg (Gregory B.]&#13;
Votaw, Hans PoUan--I think tbose were tbe people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: The different sides in tbis controversy as far as tbe Bank itself was concerned must have&#13;
come from amongst these people you've mentioned?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. I think so. And including most of aU Geoffrey Wilson.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: What was Geoffrey Wilson's position?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, he had been head of tbat department and had become a Vice President. I was invited to&#13;
a Consortium meeting while I was in India and I received a cable from Escott Reid saying please come&#13;
to tbe Consortium meeting and we would like you to write a speech. I agreed. I got off a plane in&#13;
Atbens and wrote tbe speech in tbe hotel and took anotber plane and went on to Paris. And so I gave&#13;
them a copy, and tbey looked at it. I don't know exactly what happened, I got no particular comment.&#13;
It was a fairly mild kind of critique; I !bought it was put rather diplomaticaUy. But some people have&#13;
ideas about my capacity for diplomacy which maybe were different from my own.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING)&#13;
     We went off to a meeting in the morning and Geoffrey Wilson invited me to go in his car. I&#13;
thought I was being elevated to an honorable position, but the reason I was asked into his car was so he&#13;
could tell me, "You can't make the speech." I said, "Really?" What emerged was that L. K Jha, who&#13;
was the F"mance Secretary in India at the time, didn't like it. Jha became Governor of Kashmir, and&#13;
also head of the central bank. He was an extremely intelligent, talented man whom I liked despite the&#13;
fact that he was on the other side of the fence. He didn't like it. And advanced copies had been sent to&#13;
too many people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I was not terribly pleased at this event. If this was meant to, you know, silence those people who&#13;
interpreted their mission as having a mouth or tongue it was not successful because we continued to&#13;
pursue whatever we had to pursue, whatever we felt was worth pursuing at the time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And I take it you did not make the speech?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, I did not make that speech. I was invited to make speeches in India by people who knew&#13;
exactly what they were going to get. They weren't necessarily made publicly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did it become established in time that Bank people were allowed, so to speak, to make any&#13;
presentation to the Consortium that they wanted to?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Who knows? Who knows?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But in your time the speeches had to be presented in advance to the relevant Indian&#13;
Government ministers?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, so it would appear. But at one point there was an article written in Economic Weeklv,&#13;
which was a very influential journal in Bombay, about the interfering nature of the Bank's office in&#13;
Delhi. I knew the editor very well; he was not there when this was published, he was away. He was a&#13;
very good friend of mine. The next time I went down to Bombay I went to see him and presented him&#13;
with a bottle of whiskey, of which he was very fond. I said, "Now you tell me who wrote that article."&#13;
And he said to me, "Aid without strings." He said, "I can tell you that if I was here that article would&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                       -23-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING)&#13;
not have appeared, but I can't teU you who wrote it.â&#128;¢ Anyway, obviously this was sort of, it was in some&#13;
sense a plant. But it was a controversy and I do think this somehow led to the notion of a BeU-type&#13;
mission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: WeU, even in the case of the BeU Mission there is a great deal of difference of opinion&#13;
between the Bank on the one hand and the Indian Government on the other hand as to who controUed&#13;
the report. It had to be agreed by the Bank in advance that no parts of the report would be issued,&#13;
printed and made public without the agreement of the Indian Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And then as I understand it, the Government of India, having for its part agreed that it&#13;
would not release the report without the consent of the Bank did arrange, or somebody within the&#13;
Indian Government did arrange, to have parts of the report made public without the Bank's knowing&#13;
that this was even going to happen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's entirely possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: So that there was not total agreement between the Indian Government on the one hand and&#13;
the Bank on the other hand as, at the very least, the procedure by which the two would work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: WeU, of course these leaks would often happen for political reasons. I mean one side getting at&#13;
another. That happened in Sri Lanka on one occasion when a Bank report was supposed to be secret&#13;
and most of it was published in Sri Lanka but probably by someone who was against the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But it seems to Â·me that the overriding conflict was on the subject: was the Bank working&#13;
for the Government, so to speak, or was the Bank working for itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's right.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -24-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And you were saying that the Bank should be working for itself and gathering information&#13;
and should have the authority to issue relevant information if it chose to do so to members of the&#13;
Consortium. But the Indian Government felt that it had the final authority over what information was&#13;
to be given to the Bank, if any. And this kind of controversy was not even settled after the Bell Mission&#13;
report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, in most countries it's never settled, but I thought that India was an extreme example of&#13;
the case. There were some Middle Eastern countries where they tell you nothing. It was an&#13;
unwillingness to discuss things, I felt. Even people I thought I knew would become very uptight if I sort&#13;
of said, "Well, why is this?" There may have been perfectly good political reasons in certain cases, less&#13;
good political reasons in other cases, and certainly no good reasons for minister A not informing&#13;
minister B of something which he should have known.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, let me ask the question about the Bank today. I may be naive, but I have the&#13;
impression that a Bank mission can go into any member country and ask any question about the&#13;
economy, anything that bears directly on the Bank's lending program, and expect to get straight&#13;
answers, insofar as they were available, from the government, and that the answers then become the&#13;
Bank's property. It may for its own reasons choose to put a high degree of confidentiality on it, but&#13;
nonetheless it's the Bank's own decision as to what it does with the information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well you'd have to ask the lawyers about the confidentiality question. I think that all&#13;
information from a government, uuless it's already in the public domain, is confidential. But&#13;
confidential means different things and exactly how that works I don't know because Bank publications&#13;
have been made available for scholarly reasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I've interrupted you enough. You set part of the stage for the Bell Mission report and&#13;
I want of course to ask you about your participation in that. But are there other remarks you want to&#13;
make about India before we talk about the Bell Mission?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, apart from the sort of anecdotal ones about George Woods visiting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I would appreciate your reciting those at some point.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, he came out to India on one occasion and I had arranged to meet him at the airport. I&#13;
got the office car ready and called out an hour or more before the flight was due. Unfortunately&#13;
Qantas on that particular day wanted to get home fast and they arrived at Palam Airport early. So&#13;
although we hit the road at 70 miles an hour we got there in time to find that George Woods had&#13;
already gone to his hotel. So we went back, somewhat more slowly, and I went to see him and said,&#13;
''I'm sorry, but there were some things over which I had little contro~ such as people arriving an hour&#13;
early." And he said, "Oh, good heavens, don't worry about that, I think meeting people at the airport is&#13;
a barbaric custom." So he wasn't particularly concerned about that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But the main story about George Woods was that we went around a bit together and he asked me&#13;
to come to Bombay with him. And as he was retiring early to his room in the Taj Hotel in Bombay, he&#13;
said, "Is there anything else on your mind?' And I said, 'Yes there is." And we sat down in the lobby&#13;
on a bench and I explained to him that I had understood from my colleagues in Washington that he was&#13;
dead against any discussion of exchange rate. I said I would like to make the case suggesting that this&#13;
was wrong. He looked at me with his sort of eyebrows twitching a bit and he said, 'Well, I certainly&#13;
hear you. You're quite right, that's what I think, but I will hear your case." And so I made the case as&#13;
best I could in terms which I thought he would appreciate. And he did concede at the end. He was&#13;
quite tough in his arguing against it but he did concede at the end that the Bank did have a legitimate&#13;
reason for discussing exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now that must have been well before Beruie Bell actually had been appointed, because I&#13;
understand that he subsequently raised this issue. That is part of the history of the issue of exchange&#13;
rates. But apparently up to that time if anybody had argued the case for it in Washington, he certainly&#13;
had not been convinced that the door should be left even slightly ajar, rather than closed completely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, shall we proceed to the Bell Mission itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You were responsible for one volume of 13 or 14 volumes.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. I can't remember how many volumes there were. I worked part time I would say on the&#13;
BeU Mission because I still had my job as Resident Representative. I had previously become interested&#13;
in the planning process in India, largely because I knew some people in the Planning Commission. I&#13;
knew people who had written books about the Planning Commission. I had read reports of the&#13;
Planning Commission. I had become interested in it as an institution and the way it worked. I had&#13;
spoken with a number of people, who talked to me very much off the record. In fact I have notes which&#13;
I now have saved from Mr. X. And even I don't remember who Mr. X was because I was concerned&#13;
with someone fmding out that people would teU me these things. And so when the BeU Mission came&#13;
out, I had some intimate knowledge of what went wrong in Delhi. I had copies of reports of various&#13;
kinds which had been issued in various stages. And one of the things I was most interested in was the&#13;
views of the state governm!'nts on the planning process, which I suspected--and it was not a difficult&#13;
thing to suspect--were rather different from the view from the center. And so I visited a number of&#13;
state governments. Andhra Pradesh and Kerala and Mysore I guess were the principal ones.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: These are the names of the states?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. I wrote a volume on the planning process, the list of events which foUowed the&#13;
publication of the Third Five-Year Plan through to the Fourth Five-Year Plan. And having written it, I&#13;
decided that I'd gone too far because I introduced into it ideas which were perhaps somewhat beyond&#13;
my station. I introduced the caste system as part of the explanation of why the planning system worked&#13;
the way it did. I thought that was going too far. And I revised it and the revised version--other people&#13;
commented on it, too, within the Bank--and the revised version went off with everybody else's. I&#13;
understand what everybody understands, that the Indian Government says that they are wiUing to print&#13;
and circulate aU of this report except for the volume that I wrote. Now whether this story is true I don't&#13;
know, because things get colored and get colored the way you want them to get colored. Stauley&#13;
Please, I think it was, told me that on one of his visits to Delhi the Government said they found this&#13;
among the more interesting volumes but in no way could they have it published.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did anybody ever suggest what it was in your volume that they worried about as being&#13;
controversial?&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -27-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No. By that time l was, I suppose, slightly battle-worn as to questions of why people didn't like&#13;
things. I had spent many, many hours discussing the publication of a volume on the economic&#13;
development of Spain, where I had spent three months on one of these other big missions. The&#13;
Government had agreed to publish the report as a condition of having a mission, but when the report&#13;
came to them they said under no circumstances could they conceive of publishing it. And then some&#13;
compromise arrangement was made. (Stauley) Raymond Cope and I met with a senior official who&#13;
subsequently became Prime Minister under Franco. We sat down for two days and went through the&#13;
report line by line. It gradually dawned on us that the things we thought were most objectionable from&#13;
their point of view were not the things that they objected to at all, but other things which we&#13;
considered, for the most part, fairly trivial. So we put up a show of resistance but gave in graciously&#13;
many times and as far as I'm concerned the report is more or less as we wrote it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So trying to fathom why people object to things is something which is often an exercise in futility.&#13;
But I wasn't even there so I have no idea why they objected to it. It was very critical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Given the speech that you had prepared and were not allowed to give and the volume that&#13;
you wrote and were not allowed to have published, you must have begun to feel that you were having&#13;
bad luck, at the very least.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, no. There is a countervailing feeling. If you write something and have it published, it&#13;
cannot conceivably be controversial and therefore you can always console yourself with the thought that&#13;
it's only the people who aren't published who have anything to say.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Ah. Very good, very good. Well, what other anecdotes or bits of information do you want&#13;
to say about India? I want to ask you about the economics work in the Bank, too, this afternoon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I should mention, of course--and this is up your street--that I led one of the Bank's first urban&#13;
missions to Bombay.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -28-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: When was that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That was in November 1970.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But this was after you had departed India?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, yes. I was working in an urban capacity and I did go back to India for that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, while we're talking about India, why don't you say what you care to about that report&#13;
on Bombay and then we can move into the period after you left.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well it was re-issued sometime. The reason I mentioned it was largely because by sheer&#13;
coincidence it was not published either. But it was not published for an entirely different reason. It&#13;
wasn't that it was controversial, but it's a fascinating case of how bureaucracy can work. It was a&#13;
report without a category. We sent it to the Indian Government in a yellow cover or something, but it&#13;
wasn't an economics report, it wasn't a project report, it wasn't an anything.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: This was before formal work had begun in the Bank on urbanization?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, it had just begun, but an urban report was something which didn't exist. We sent a copy&#13;
down to the files and they said, "We can't keep it because it's a yellow cover." We said,"Well, terribly&#13;
sorry, if that's what you fee~ that's okay." But the filing system was such that they were unable to&#13;
categorize it, so they said. Many years later it was thought that it would be a good idea to re-issue it.&#13;
And maybe it's now an official document, because it now has a document number.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Perfectly respectable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Perfectly respectable and re-issued. It now has a fig leaf on it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That's marvelous. Of course the urbanization work in the Bank always has been a bit&#13;
ambiguous because it's hard to know whether a water project in a city is a water project or an urban&#13;
project. And the economics of urbanization is, in my view at least, a good deal less precise in its&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                          -29-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
theoretical aspects than microeconomic theory or even macroeconomic theory, that is, the more&#13;
established parts of economic theories. So while people in the Bank recognize that urban problems&#13;
were important and needed to be addressed, it was always hard for people to know precisely where&#13;
they fit. I guess this must have been clearly true of your Bombay report. How did you come to make&#13;
the report in the first place? Was it asked for by the projects people or by the Indian Government?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: It was agreed. A lot of things happen in a kind of osmotic way: somebody talks to somebody&#13;
and somebody comes back, and somebody goes to India and somebody comes back and they agree and&#13;
then a letter goes out and another letter comes back. Exactly how things start I'm not sure. The&#13;
people in Bombay were really quite cooperative. I think it was a reasonably interesting report in which&#13;
a number of different interesting issues came up, although you say this is an imprecise science, and I&#13;
agree. But on the other hand, there are issues which are sufficiently obvious that when you bring them&#13;
out in an urban context versus a national context, they become very clear. A very clear one is the policy&#13;
of a national railway in its intercity traffic versus the policy required in a city for commuter traffic. It is&#13;
a question of social benefit and private benefit, but private benefit being in a public institution. The&#13;
private loss to the national railways of having its overnight mail train arrive in the middle of the&#13;
commuter hour is zero. They don't care. But if you need tracks, new tracks in order to provide&#13;
sufficient lines for commuter traffic during that hour, it makes a hell of a difference to the city of&#13;
Bombay. It was this sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure. That's why there are various political jurisdictions apart from a national government,&#13;
at least in a nation that has any real size in terms of population and geography. I would have still&#13;
thought that the sum total of all of the benefits of an identifiable geographic area that might be called a&#13;
nation ought in theory to b~ addable and the costs, including external diseconomies, ought also to be&#13;
addable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: They are, but they're not addable if you don't know what they are.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Of course.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                          -30-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: And I don't say this is peculiar to the Indian railways. But a national railway network, although&#13;
a public institution, does not advertise in its annual report any diseconomies that it causes to anybody&#13;
else.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Of course. That's why we invent shadow prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        While we're dealing with some of these economic questions that come up from time to time, I&#13;
wonder if I might ask a very general question: what happened to the economics work, how did it&#13;
expand, how did it change in quality, and that sort of thing, beginning, let's say, in 1963 when George&#13;
Woods became President and specified that he wanted to expand the economics work of the Bank,&#13;
through some time during the [RobertS.] McNamara years? There certainly was a great deal of&#13;
change over this period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I would like, if I may, to go back slightly earlier because there was something that I was&#13;
personally concerned with. I think one of the curious backdoor influences on economics in the Bank&#13;
was ED!, which (Sir Alexander] Cairncross started at the beginning of 1956. I went there in June 1957.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        One thing that happened at the ED I was that we were free to invite, and did invite, anyone we&#13;
liked from the academic world. So we became exposed to ideas from the outside. To turn to a theme&#13;
I've used before, we had time to read and think. The issue that I was concerned with was a&#13;
microeconomic one. I had two sessions in one of the courses on discounted cash flow, present value,&#13;
and all that jazz, which in those days was not a very normal feature of any project evaluation in the&#13;
Bank, to say the least.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I'm surprised. I thought that began with the beginning of the project work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, sir. On the contrary. So I started producing these lectures on the rate of return and what&#13;
is meant by rate of return and so on, and quirks about rates of return, what happens if you have two&#13;
mutually exclusive projects, two mutually supporting projects, and all that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In September 1959 I prepared a paper for the Staff Economic Committee, which was in the&#13;
Economic Staff, (Leonard] Rist's staff, for a discussion as to whether you shouldn't be doing this in the&#13;
Bank's evaluation of projec~s. The irony was that we were teaching our clients what to do but not doing&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -31-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(KING]&#13;
it ourselves, an irony that was not lost on me at all. And again this created a very considerable&#13;
controversy because there was one person in the then Projects Department, an economic advisor, who&#13;
said this is something we need to think about. You can agree with it, you can disagree, you can make&#13;
arguments against it or for it, but you can't say it's none of their business. You see, one of the troubles&#13;
of the Bank all along is that sometimes there has been the feeling that it's none of their business. And&#13;
while it's always uncomfortable when you're running something to have some idiot somewhere else in&#13;
the Bank saying how lousy what you're doing is, you better take notice if he has a sound case. And this&#13;
would fit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     But it did happen that this change took place not very long afterwards. They started an&#13;
experiment. Herman van der Tak wrote the first occasional paper in 1966, The Economic Choice&#13;
Between Hydroelectric and Thermal Power Developments (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University&#13;
Press, 1966], on comparing--the great example at the time was hydroelectric projects versus thermal&#13;
projects: how do you compare one against the other unless you introduced some rate of return&#13;
concept? But before that the Bank did not use that. But mind you neither did anybody else.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I can't imagine how projects were evaluated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, that's a good question. But you know, this was what the Harvard Business Review was&#13;
producing. There was the old rule of thumb about payback periods--which was early Marxist economic&#13;
theory, and it may still be as far as I know--and how many years to get your money back, which was&#13;
crude.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But it was heavily in the tradition of the German historical school of economists, before&#13;
1900, to discount all kinds of things for purposes of discovering present values and making&#13;
comparisons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Maybe. But it was news to the business world, news to the Bank. Even when I was in India I&#13;
met the fellow who was the representative of Unilever, not a small time firm, who said, "Oh, you've&#13;
written a paper on the discounted rate of return. I would like to look at it; I've been trying to persuade&#13;
my head office." Anyway, this is one of those sort of things which happens in a kind of strange,&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -32-&#13;

subterranean way which often don't show up in the history. It just happens that I was personally&#13;
involved and I knew about it, but I suspect that there was more that came out of the EDI because of&#13;
these things. We had people coming from outside and there was some filtering back to the Bank as&#13;
people moved from the EDI back to the Bank, people who'd been teaching there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    As I mentioned to you at lunch, Woods once asked me about the idea of The Economic Adviser.&#13;
As you rightly pointed out, it was a big joke in the Bank. How important the 'The" was. And I didn't&#13;
know much about Irving Friedman at the time. I have to say that my whole experience with Irving was&#13;
one of almost continuous clash. You will have to forgive me for not remembering the details of what it&#13;
was, but my general feeling was that he was wrongheaded about the way he went about almost&#13;
everything, including running the Economic Committee. And in the end the poor man got ulcers and&#13;
probably didn't know what hit him. So far as I was concerned, he was a continuous pain in the neck.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I think that if I can characterize the sort of issue, it would be that he would ask a question like how&#13;
much money does the Third World need? Which was a George Woods sort of question, you know.&#13;
Well the obvious answer to that is: for what? You know. And it's not an idle question. And then he&#13;
would spend a lot of peoples' energy, including his own, in devising ways of sort of fuzzing out the&#13;
issues so that you didn't have to say for what. And you just felt that he was an inadequate link to the&#13;
President, who was maybe asking the question in the same form he did. I don't know, I just never felt&#13;
at ease. I never felt that a discussion with him was particularly easy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It is true that under the general revision of the structure of the Bank, a greater degree of&#13;
professionalism was introduced. But you see, you had The Economic Adviser up there with sundry sort&#13;
of troops at his command. I think there was also a creditworthiness unit or some funny thing up there,&#13;
and a new Economics Department, with [Andrew M.] Kamarck at its head. I was in that for a time.&#13;
And there was this Economic Committee, which wasn't a bad institution with all the economic advisers&#13;
or whatever they were called, the chief economists of the regions, in it and several other people and, as&#13;
you mentioned, somebody from the Fund. I personally didn't object to having anybody from the Fund&#13;
there; I thought it was quite uice to have somebody with that kind of position. It made sense and,&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -33-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
you know, it was an opportunity to get back at the Fund when we thought they were being a bit idiotic,&#13;
too. So I mean it went both ways. It was a much more informal atmosphere than I think the Fund&#13;
people were used to, so they had to be careful not to just sort of issue a position as though they....&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     But I think there was a lot of consideration and discussion in those days of what was known as&#13;
performance. Performance has been up and down as a kind of criterion of lending and so on for a long&#13;
time--whether you can measure it and whether you can extract conditions about it and so on. I think&#13;
Irving Friedman had too much religion about some of these things in a way which made it very difficult&#13;
to discuss.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     But I think there was a general upgrading, as you say, of the economic field; there were new&#13;
people who came in who had more up to date training. That's always been true of the Bank, I mean,&#13;
every succeeding generation introduces people who have been even more esoteric mortals than before,&#13;
and so I think there was some advance. There was certainly the preparation of a group of people who&#13;
could still be used in the next wave of change, which of course was when Hollis (Chenery] came in.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Would you speak about that wave of change?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, yes, I mean I remember a very funny thing that when Hollis came in, one of the first&#13;
things he did was to call, I think it was David [P. D.] Henderson and myself and somebody else to his&#13;
office. I don't know what my capacity was in those days. But I remember he'd obviously got some cue&#13;
from McNamara that there were these stubborn antediluvian types who really didn't want to do what&#13;
he wanted to do, which as far as I was concerned was true, but not in an economic context. I just felt&#13;
McNamara's way of approaching lending and policy discussions was wrong, and that's why we're in this&#13;
structural adjustment bind. That's a different subject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    What Hollis Chenery did first, as I was saying, he delivered this sort of generalized lecture. It was&#13;
almost like a coach: either you're playing on the team or you're not. I mean, no beer drinking at night,&#13;
or cocaine. And I sort of listened to him patiently because I felt this was kind of a set speech. And in&#13;
fact Hollis and I had a really good relationship all the time he was there. The changes which were&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -34-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
made were very sweeping under McNamara cum Hollis, and they were really of two quite separate&#13;
kinds, although there was a link between them. The first kind was a much greater policing, if you like,&#13;
of country economic work, policing in the sense of review of reports, of trying to make sure that there&#13;
was programmatic consistency in assumptions. The World Development &amp;Pll!1 was preceded by&#13;
some unpublished papers called 'Prospects for Developing Countries,' which took place some years,&#13;
four or five years, before the World Development &amp;Pll!1 ever came out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The idea of centralized statistical control was extended very considerably. McNamara was of&#13;
course a maniac when it came to statistics and wanted to know how many grandfathers there were in&#13;
Chad whose first name began with B and had red-headed granddaughters. And he had no idea what a&#13;
confidence range was. You know, he felt that if you're going to give those figures out you couldn't say,&#13;
it might be between 10 and 20, it had to he 13.7. But the notion of having a central kind of statistical&#13;
basis for the Bank did take hold then. It's still a problem because they still don't agree; what serves the&#13;
country well does not serve the central part well. One of the advances he could have made was to have&#13;
recognized this and devised a system which could have in a sense dealt with it, made a compromise in&#13;
the circumstances. But he didn't. And I guess the last thing I did under Hollis was to write a report on&#13;
a statistical system which is, again, on a shelf somewhere.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: But also in the archives?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Who knows? Who knows?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It was not a published report?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I don't know. I think it was delivered to Anne Krueger, who didn't like anything that&#13;
Hollis ever did. But I don't know whether those copies are left in the archives. But that was one thing,&#13;
this constant review of the country program papers, the organizing of all this, the writing of policy&#13;
papers. There was a lot of ferment on issues which affected Bank lending in a macro sense. I was co-&#13;
author of a new system of economic reporting which we set up, which I was asked by Hollis to write.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -35-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
We managed to convince McNamara it was a natural evolution of what he thought ought to be done&#13;
when in fact it was the reverse. He agreed with it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       The second thing was creating a research establishment in the Bank of, ultimately, very high&#13;
caliber. Some things went wrong, it wasn't all high caliber, there were some duds. But the Bank at that&#13;
time achieved I think--you could probably say better from the outside than I can--a reputation of being&#13;
a superior academic institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well that of course is an issue that goes back almost to the beginnings of the Bank. One&#13;
thing that I think is not generally known in the Bank is that Paul Rosenstein-Rodan was one of the&#13;
persons who strongly advocated the EDI, but one reason was that he wanted the EDI to be a seat for&#13;
academic-type economic research, in addition to the things that it did.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Right, right, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It didn't grow in that direction, so this possibility of doing academic-type research within the&#13;
Bank was delayed for a very long time. I think Friedman tried to set up a bit of it, but it didn't get very&#13;
far.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No. My recollection is that the ouly thing that Friedman ever did, I think, was to bring in Guy&#13;
Orcutt, from Yale. Guy Orcutt, yes. I remember talking to Guy Orcutt. He came around and wrote a&#13;
nice report. He made a sensible report. He seemed to be a sensible person. That was all that ever&#13;
happened. It was Guy Orcutt in, Guy Orcutt out, and that's it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes, but it's partly because Friedman and Kamarck were not getting any support from&#13;
elsewhere in the Bank. The point I was making was that many people in the Bank from the beginning&#13;
have said, "The Bank has no business doing research which is not related in some sense to its&#13;
operations. We can read academic journals, we can hire as consultants academic people who are&#13;
associated with universities, but they ought to be at universities. There's no need to have them in the&#13;
Bank itself."&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -36-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I know, I've heard that argument, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: So that's the argument that prevailed clear through the early Chenery years under&#13;
McNamara and then something happened to make it possible vastly to increase the hiring of people&#13;
who...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: It happened almost from the beginning I think this went into high gear almost immdiately, as&#13;
soon as McNamara hired Chenery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, the number of people in the Bank who would have been equally at home in Yale's&#13;
Economics Department, let's say, was still relatively small in 1970-71 and this was two to three years&#13;
after McNamara carne. Hollis Chenery himself didn't come until1970, so it didn't happen immediately&#13;
with McNamara's arriving on the scene.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no, no. I said soon after Chenery carne.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: All right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, that's right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, are you suggesting that to do this, for lack of a better phrase, more academically-&#13;
oriented economics research, was the major purpose of Chenery's coming to the Bank? In other&#13;
words, was McNamara specifically seeking that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, yes. I think that that was one of the two purposes. I think the other purpose was the&#13;
whole policy side of it. We had policy issues on everything: health papers, income distribution, you&#13;
name it. He wanted better country work, more professional country work, and then the research on&#13;
the other side.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Apart from the original contribution of the Bank to the Pennsylvania University International&#13;
Comparisons Project the research started with a budget in the initial year, which I think this about&#13;
1972, roughly. And then people were invited to submit projects for funding; there were a lot of projects&#13;
and there were three groups of people who were invited to comment on that. Bela Balassa would&#13;
know, you can talk to him. But I was on one of the groups. There was a lot of pressure to get research&#13;
projects started.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -37-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You mean economic research projects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Economics research projects. And they came in from Yale, from Harvard, from MIT, from&#13;
Berkeley. Then there were also people who came to the Bank on term contracts--Irma Adelman and&#13;
people like that--for a year or two sabbatical type things. It just went into high gear right from the&#13;
beginning. And a lot of mistakes were made, too. You know, it was a pressure thing. It wasn't as&#13;
though we said, "Well, we'll do a little bit and see how it goes." There was a very definite quantum leap&#13;
in one fiscal year which can be seen in the Bank's budget. Actually it's not reflected wholly in the&#13;
Bank's budget because the Bank's budget has a line item for economic research. But that line item is&#13;
for external funds and behind and under that there's an enormous amount of staff time and new staff&#13;
positions. This was a very deliberate and very intensive effort of which I remember being very much a&#13;
part. And then when I came back from Canada I was the economic adviser, so I've seen that from the&#13;
beginning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, let me summarize what it seems to me we're saying here and see if I do it correctly.&#13;
We have agreed that when Woods came in he wanted an increase in the economics work, partly&#13;
because he had this new beast, IDA, to deal with for which he was seeking to increase funding, and he&#13;
was not clear how a country should be categorized, as being either eligible for IDA Funds, or for Bank&#13;
loans only.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Or how much they should ask for.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Or how much you should ask for in the case of each country. So poverty, performance,&#13;
things like that, were put forward, but the more important point is that he felt he needed economists to&#13;
help deal with these problems. Nonetheless, they were operational problems of the Bank, and&#13;
therefore he felt that whatever economics work was done in the Bank ought to have some operational&#13;
relationship. Woods really opposed expansion into what might be called academic economics research,&#13;
in the Bank of any substantial quantity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That I don't know. That may be true. I think he partly opposed it inadvertently because I&#13;
don't think it was part oflrving Friedman's agenda.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                             -38-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: But I talked to Andy Kamarck on this subject, and Andy sought help from various academic .&#13;
institutions. He was told that he could support academic research by having the Bank contribute to&#13;
grants; indeed I think that's how the University of Pennsylvania relationship began. He talked to Irving&#13;
Kravis about doing work at Pennsylvania.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I went up to University of Pennsylvania to see Irving. I was in on that, too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Okay. Well, am I characterizing this reasonably correctly? The Bank was willing to help&#13;
finance this but it was still thought to be better carried out at a university rather than within the Bank&#13;
itself!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, and I think there were good reasons for that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Talking about the first instance now?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, yes. Well, the university and the UN, I don't think the Bank was equipped for that. That's&#13;
a different issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Under McNamara the decision was made, perhaps stemming from McNamara himself, but&#13;
I think with advice from people in the Economics Department at Harvard, that the Bank really should&#13;
be doing in-house more of the work which traditionally had been associated with universities and&#13;
therefore had a tenuous immediate relationship to the Bank's operations. Presumably all research that&#13;
is really useful ultimately has some...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: The other very strong, guiding principle, which Hollis Chenery certainly felt, was that the Bank&#13;
had an incomparable    colle~tion   of data, or if it didn't have the data at least the potentiality to get it.&#13;
Ergo, for any kind of research involving international comparability, there was ouly one place for the&#13;
research to be in the world and that was the Bank, because it knew the countries, it had access to the&#13;
data, and therefore it should be done there. But if you were an academic in Harvard, you could go&#13;
around to this country and that country and the other country. That would be nice, you'd meet your&#13;
crack fellow academics, but you really wouldn't get the hard data. And the complaint was often that&#13;
the people in the Bank had better access to data of a country than the nationals of a country itself.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -39-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, the collection and gathering and cataloging of the data within the Bank--same thing as&#13;
doing economic analysis--I'm aware of the fact that Kamarck again felt as early as 1964 that a major&#13;
function of the Economics Department was to vastly improve the collection of statistics per se, and to&#13;
help countries set up within their own organizations better statistical gathering services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, what I'm saying is that Hollis Chenery felt that if you were going to do research, the kinds&#13;
of economic research which required data...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Then you have to have the data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Then the place to do it was the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: To do the research or to collect the data, or both?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: The actual data or the capacity to get it existed in the Bank. These capabilities did not exist&#13;
outside the Bank in the same degree.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I understand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Therefore it made sense to have academic-type research in the Bank. If you want to do&#13;
something, whether it's an international comparison of income distribution or the microeconomic&#13;
effects of irrigation systems on social conditions in the irrigated basin, on land values or whatever, these&#13;
were the things where the Bank through its own natural mechanism had some pull.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That's the issue that I've been trying to get at.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: And he felt, I think from personal experience outside the Bank, that nobody outside the Bank&#13;
could get into the Bank to use that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: To use the data. But the Bank was already beginning to publish a great deal more statistics&#13;
before Chenery came.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -40-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's true. But that was the World Tables or something like that maybe. He just felt that that&#13;
was more UN-type work. The idea was not to compete necessarily with the UN Statistical Office. In&#13;
fact, we always envisioned ihe Kravis thing should go ultimately to the UN Statistical Office. That it&#13;
was the proper place. The Bank shouldn't get into that kind of business. Rightly, I think. But I think&#13;
that Hollis' idea was that the Bank had this unique opportunity to exploit its access. This access has&#13;
vastly different meanings. I don't know if you've seen a shelf full of Bank documents about labor&#13;
markets, about this, about that. It was the kind of internal communications system within the Bank and&#13;
from the Bank to the country that could offer people all sorts of opportunities for carrying out certain&#13;
kinds of quote, "pertinent,' unquote, research. Many people would question the "pertinent."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: The question that I am seeking an answer to: did it not require not only Chenery but the&#13;
personality of McNamara to do this kind of in-house research as distinct from statistics gathering? I&#13;
understand it would have been unlikely under Woods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, absolutely. Totally unlikely under Woods, because I don't think Chenery would have been&#13;
there under Woods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I agree with that. I think it's probably true that Friedman was doing, or at least trying to do,&#13;
what Woods thought an economic advisor should do in terms of economic analysis that was related to&#13;
the kinds of questions that Woods wanted answers to, like how much IDA funding should he be&#13;
seeking, how should the nations be classified in terms of their IDA uses and that sort of thing, which&#13;
Woods found operational. Woods has been quoted to me as having said at one point, "If the Bank&#13;
were still a Bank I wouldn't need any economists at all because I know how to give bank loans. But&#13;
when I'm dealing with IDA I don't know how to deal with it and I therefore need economists to give&#13;
me advice on what to do with this." So IDA made a big difference in Woods' mind in the approach of&#13;
the Bank toward the use of economics. Nevertheless, it was still operational and the change then that&#13;
comes with McNamara and especially with McNamaraÂ£!!!!! Chenery is that the more academic&#13;
research, again to use that phrase, is now thought to be done, in part at least, better in the Bank than&#13;
outside the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -41-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Not necessarily better in the Bank than outside the Bank, but the Bank should be a strong,&#13;
significant part of the academic community. There will still be people in Berkeley and Chicago and&#13;
MIT and whatever, not to speak of other countries, who will be doing academic research and they'll be&#13;
doing their thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Of course. But part of what you said was that to have people who were doing academic&#13;
research close to the place where the statistics not only are kept but where they're also compiled made&#13;
sense.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: And also where you could talk to the people who were concerned with some of the issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I mean, one of the best examples is that there's Dean [T.] Jamison whom I know well in the&#13;
Bank. He came to the Bank, was turned down by the YP [Young Professional] program, came in&#13;
through the Economics Department, and is now one of the most highly considered people in the Bank.&#13;
He devised, with somebody else, a research project in the Philippines with the Philippine Government&#13;
on the use of textbooks in schools. What difference does it make whether a class of 20 has 1 textbook,&#13;
2 textbooks, or 20 textbooks? Who knows what the answer to that is?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: If his research really answered that, it must be publicized in the United States to a greater&#13;
extent than it has been.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, you see the part of the curve which the Philippines was concerned with was not the same&#13;
part that the U.S. was concerned with, because that was a question of one versus two or two versus&#13;
four or something like that. But I mention this because here was an issue. There was a project design&#13;
question: there may have been other variables besides textbooks, so that you had to kind of separate&#13;
out the variables, assessing what the effect was which may vary from one island to another and whether&#13;
they're Moslems or not, I don't know. But these sort of things were being encouraged. Now, I think&#13;
that one of the big issues that always existed during this period was, is it any bloody use?&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -42-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It still is.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Always will be. Well, I've always characterized this question in the following way, which is that&#13;
people who ask this question unfortunately sometimes ask it as though it were synonymous with, 'I&#13;
have to write a report by next Tuesday, this research does not help me do it.' Which is almost certainly&#13;
true. Now, some of the research may be good, some of it may be bad, some of it may be long term,&#13;
some of it may be short term in its applicability. But to my mind the notion of operationality is one&#13;
which has never really been well defined. To my mind, you see, what you really are trying to do is to&#13;
gradually advance the sort of mental capacity of the institution. It's hard to think about problems.&#13;
Sometimes it's a gadget. I happen to think social accounting matrices are great fun, other people think&#13;
they stink. But the fact is, you can talk to people about new kinds of ways of thinking about things, new&#13;
kinds of issues, and generally get people thinking. There were operational people who got interested,&#13;
and people from the research side who went into operations. In fact, it was a very good recruitment&#13;
method. Probably brighter people came in through that route than came through the ordinary&#13;
operating route. You know, bank types.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: So I would say this was the best thing that McNamara did; the worst thing he did was to make&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, do you want to elaborate on that or do you want to start with that tomorrow?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I'll go on with that tomorrow, but the general thesis, I think, for you to think about because you&#13;
may want to ask questions about it is: McNamara's general approach was, we must have a program.&#13;
And a very efficient program, all laid out. You know, he had programming and budgeting so advanced&#13;
that at one point three man-years was allowed for, let's say, irrigation projects. Everything was&#13;
carefully analyzed. But this programmatic approach did two things: it told the country how much&#13;
money they were getting. And if you're a loan officer and you go down to Brazil and say, 'You know, if&#13;
you don't fulfill these conditions you may not get the loan.' They'll say, "That's fme, buddy"--or&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -43-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
whatever the Brazilian equivalent of buddy is--"you can just take the next plane back to Washington&#13;
because we know you're going to make that loan to us because otherwise you're out of a job." It&#13;
separated, it definitely separated the project work from the economics work. And the Projects people&#13;
had these pipelines of projects and they had the piggybacks and all sorts of wonderful things. You&#13;
know, Pakistan, TubeweUs Four, Bangladesh, Railways Three, and so on; and you'd do a preinvestment&#13;
study while you're doing that, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Were these programs disclosed to the Board, the Executive Directors?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: There was a time when it was suggested they should be but I don't think that ever quite came&#13;
off.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: There's a difference between operations analysis for purposes of internal budgeting for&#13;
manpower needs, on the one hand, and making it clear that certain amount of lending is going to be&#13;
given at certain points of time regardless of how the internal workings go. Do I make sense?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. I think in general terms, yes, I think that was clear to the Board. I don't think the Board&#13;
as a whole was necessarily clear whether Uruguay was going to get an Irrigation Seven in 1982. That I&#13;
don't think they did, that was confidential. But it probably wasn't very confidential to the Uruguayans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I interrupted you; you wanted to make a second point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That was the ftrst thing. I think what that did was to divorce the project work from the&#13;
operational work and the point that I have always made--in answer to principally my good friend&#13;
Stanley Please who writes ahout structural adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: The Hobbled Giant?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. I haven't read that.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         Â·44-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING)&#13;
    When they first started having structural adjustment loans they suddenly woke up to the fact that&#13;
there are all sorts of policy changes that the country shonld have made. I went to a meeting, all&#13;
innocently, because Hollis was away and I was supposed to go because I was the only person there in&#13;
August or something. And I said, "Why didn't you talk about the problems when the project loans were&#13;
coming up?" They said, you know, "Well, you can't talk about macroeconomic policies when you're&#13;
making an education loan, that's ridicnlous." I said, "Why is it ridicnlous? I've done it many times&#13;
myself."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Perhaps with education loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, you know, whatever type of loans. In other words, the programmatic approach meant&#13;
that the brownie points were earned for fmishing your project; the brownie points were earned for&#13;
completing your program; no brownie points were earned for engaging in a policy discussion and&#13;
certainly no brownie points were earned by engaging in a policy discussion which might hold up a loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: How about brownie points for suggesting a modification of a program, a five-year program?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't know. I'd have to have been in McNamara's office all the time. But, there was this&#13;
definite atmosphere that--so now you come to structural adjustment. Structural adjustment is another&#13;
way of dealing with the problem which is equally wrong because it's terribly public. I preferred the old&#13;
way of dealing with things, which grew up inadvertently but conld have been adapted. You carry on a&#13;
policy discussion with the government; if you fmd that they're not being terribly cooperative you slow&#13;
down the pace of lending a little bit and make it rather clear that you wonld rather they would be more&#13;
cooperative and then you'd be rather happy to speed it up a bit. And if you don't put them on the spot&#13;
publicly, you don't specify the conditions precisely--which is crazy because you never know what the&#13;
right conditions are, you only know in general what things ought to be done if you want to change&#13;
electricity rates or whatever--and you keep it low profile so that politicians aren't being humiliated by&#13;
submitting to these awful conditions, and so on.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        Â·45-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
    Anyway, that's what I think was the big mistake that McNamara made. This programmatic&#13;
approach in which these two things were divorced. Now it's an equally big mistake with these&#13;
structural adjustment loans as a kind of "make-up" because you have to do something after an era in&#13;
which all kinds of crazy economic policies could be adopted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Will the term policy adjustment loans mean the same thing as structural adjustment loans?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It's clear that a .major thrust for the foreseeable future is going to be lending to countries&#13;
having problems with external debt. With the assumption that the Bank will induce commercial banks&#13;
to join it in making more loans in return for these countries' changing their policies so as presumably,&#13;
(a) to get growth going again, (b) to make it possible to continue to service the debt. And this seems to&#13;
me to be a bit of a modification of what the Bank has done in the past.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Structural adjustment loans originally appeared to me to include this, but this is one form of a&#13;
structural adjustment loan. I would have to read the literature. I've got some papers on that, too. But&#13;
it's been terribly formalized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And advertised.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: And advertised. Formalized and advertised.&#13;

&#13;
Memorialist: Benjamin B. King&#13;
Date of Interview: July 25, 1986&#13;
Place of Interview: Washington, D.C.&#13;
Interviewer: Robert W. Oliver&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, it seems to me tbat this discussion brings us naturally to the general subject of&#13;
external debt, and I understand you've spent a fair amount of time working on that subject over the&#13;
years. Would you care to comment about your work?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. I suppose the ftrst time I got interested in tbe debt subject necessarily was of course, as I&#13;
mentioned yesterday, with the German debt. But tbat was a very different issue; tbat was a question of&#13;
the Bank's concern with what it calls pari Pl!Wb its need to be pari PBWl with otber debts. But then&#13;
there was the whole question of accumulation of debt and its effect on economic development and its&#13;
relation to economic development. And, secondly, there was tbe Bank's collection of debt statistics, in&#13;
which it is probably the only sphere in which it is a primary source of statistics as an institution, as&#13;
opposed to the UN Statistical Office, OECD and otbers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     On tbe ftrst point, [Dragoslav] A vramovic wrote a book in 1964 on debt and growtb [Economic&#13;
Growth and External Debt. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1964] and I subsequently&#13;
wrote one myself which was published as an occasional paper [World Bank Occasional Papers Number&#13;
SixÂ· Notes on the Mechanics of Growth and Debt. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press,&#13;
1968.]. I don't know that it's been used a great deal although I tbink it could have been used more. It&#13;
is somewhat mathematical and not many people seem to have taken the time to master it, although I&#13;
personally don't tbink it's tbat difficult.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I was also very much concerned witb the Indian debt and tbe Indian debt reorganization which&#13;
took place in about 1967, which was about the time I also got interested in what I call the mechanics of&#13;
growtb and debt, since I had a concrete case. This was the occasion when the Consortium had an&#13;
arrangement, which took long in negotiation, for a certain debt reorganization for India. One of the&#13;
things which I was concerned witb and indeed wrote the paper for were the proposals for forgiveness of&#13;
debt, or postponement of debt, by the Consortium countries and by the Bank. We took the position&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -47-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
which was later felt to be a great mistake by McNamara, to my knowledge, that both the Bank and the&#13;
Consortium countries had shared in the responsibility, if you like, for lending to India and that the&#13;
Bank itself should equally share in the arrangements for reorganization. The negotiation was quite&#13;
difficult because there are all sorts of formulas that you can adopt for the sharing of the burden, if you&#13;
like, and they affected different countries in different ways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    What I did in fact was to eventually come up with four different formulas labeled A, B, C and D.&#13;
The extreme formulas A and D were particularly bad for certain different groups of countries, one for&#13;
group A and the other one for D, and this particular device of presenting the members with these four&#13;
formulas was to focus their attention on the fact that B and C were a much better compromise than A&#13;
or D and that the issue was whether this should be B or C. This had the fortunate result that almost all&#13;
of them forgot that there was an issue as to whether there should be any reorganization at all. And this&#13;
was a somewhat Machiavellian device which worked. And so there finally was an agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I don't remember; did you say what year we're talking about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, that was in 1967. I have in these notes that there was a meeting in Paris on Indian debt&#13;
and there were subsequently Consortium meetings and Consultative Group meetings in the latter part&#13;
of 1967 and early in 1968.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I'm wondering whether there's any relation to the Bell Mission? It was my understanding&#13;
that it was recommended by the Mission that if the Indian Government would consent to certain&#13;
modifications of its policy, particularly devaluation of the rupee, that the Consortium would be induced&#13;
or asked at least to increase the amount of assistance for two or three years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, I think there is a connection. I doubt very much that there was a formal connection but&#13;
on the other hand I think you're right that this was, if you like, a sort of a gentlemen's agreement or&#13;
understanding, that the Bank would try and do this. It is also my recollection that the Indian&#13;
Government at that time rather took the view that the Bank should be carrying the ball for India,&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                          -48-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(KING]&#13;
that an expression of disappointment at the outcome of this reorganization was made by one senior&#13;
official, I.G. Patel, as I recall. I must say that this, to my mind, expressed little appreciation of the&#13;
difficulty of getting any reorganization at all. It sort of emphasizes the differences of view between the&#13;
attitude of the Indian Government at the time and those people who thought that there should have&#13;
been a more mutual understanding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I attended other meetings subsequently in the early 1970s in the DAC (Development Assistance&#13;
Committee] because the OECD became interested in the debt question, too, but I was just acting as&#13;
kind of an adviser. But the whole question of debt was something which occupied me for quite a time.&#13;
And the other side of it is in debt statistics because the Bank as a primary source used to collect debt&#13;
statistics from the borrower. Now, one of the interesting things which emerged from some of the&#13;
Indian Consortium meetings and from this question of indebtedness of India was that the borrowers, or&#13;
the borrower in this case, and the lenders seemed to have very different views of what they owed each&#13;
other, what one owed the other. I mean there was a surface inconsistency, and it was almost universal.&#13;
I mean there was hardly a lender who produced figures which were the same as what the borrower&#13;
produced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: How could this be?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, it's very easy in life for these things to happen because in some cases the categories were&#13;
different. In other words, if a country made loans available to an entity which was not a central&#13;
government, the central government might just not include it because somehow or other, you know,&#13;
institutions are sloppy by nature and they don't necessarily say what a collection of data really means.&#13;
There were date questions, you know. There's always the possibility that on July 31 of year X I have&#13;
recorded something and you haven't because you aren't up to date and I am, or I sent it by mail and&#13;
you haven't got it yet, and things like that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I would have thought in a case as important as loans from a consortium of governments to a&#13;
single government like India that some sort of a third party would be asked to keep the books: The&#13;
World Bank or the Bank for International Settlements.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -49-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no, no. Well, anyway, as a result of this the OECD and the Bank tried to convince the&#13;
lenders to produce data on their lending to developing countries so that you would get a cross-check.&#13;
This is a much more complicated subject than you might think because you can form a little sort of&#13;
three or four by four matrix in which you can put down some of the data and some of the boxes are&#13;
known to both the lender and the borrower, easily; some of the data are known to one but not to the&#13;
other necessarily, unless they try hard, and vice versa; and some of the boxes are not known to either of&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     At any rate, what we tried to do was to devise a system whereby the lending governments would&#13;
report both to the Bank and the OECD. The OECD was interested for other reasons as well as the&#13;
sort of reasons that we were interested in. Around 1966, somewhat before the actual Indian debt&#13;
reorganization, the issue had already come up. I was engaged in 1965, well the end of 1965 through&#13;
1966, in lengthy negotiations with all the major OECD countries, the British, the French, the Germans,&#13;
the U.S. particularly, and with my colleagues from the OECD on having a reporting system. We fmally&#13;
agreed on one. How satisfactorily it's been, you would have to ask people who use it here. We knew it&#13;
wasn't going to be wholly satisfactory but we thought it was better than nothing. It was very interesting&#13;
what the attitudes of the different lenders were. I remember having a conversation with the people&#13;
responsible in the U.S. Government, who were very lukewarm. And when I asked them why they were&#13;
not interested, there was one man who very honestly and very forthrightly said, "No.". He said, "We&#13;
lend a lot of money to Argentina, whatever country it is, and we'd rather not know how much we've&#13;
lent."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
.OLIVER: You better not let The Washington Post get wind of that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: It's absolutely true. You know, if the Ex-ImBank lent some and AID lent some and somebody&#13;
else--and this is quite excluding the Bank of America and others. And the French had...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I bet George Woods never would have let that happen in First Boston.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's right. All the governments were very touchy about military loans, as indeed the&#13;
borrowers were, but the lenders just as much. And we had to kind of make exceptions for that.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                          -50-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING]&#13;
There was one fmal point, the nature of which I forget because I don't really recall that it was really&#13;
that important, on which we had a difference of opinion with the French. There's always some touchy&#13;
point with the French Government. And I well recall that it was at some cocktail party in the State&#13;
Department after some conference or something here that I was attending because of this and the&#13;
French delegate and I were discussing it over a drink and he agreed. I said, "If you really mean that,&#13;
put your glass down." He said, "Yes." So it was in a sense the final nail in the shoe was struck over&#13;
drinks in the State Department. I suppose that's sort of the way things happen many times.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     But, the only other point that I would make about the collection of debt statistics is that for many&#13;
years when I was concerned with the subject, I had a strong feeling--I suppose I take a hard line on a&#13;
number of things--that the Bank was very soft on borrowing countries. There are very rigid statements&#13;
in the Bank's loan agreement about the obligations of countries to report, and it was extremely&#13;
frustrating for the people who were dealing with the collection of debt statistics to feel that when a loan&#13;
was being considered for a particular country and it had been very lax, to say the least, in fulfilling its&#13;
obligations under the previous loan agreements, that the Bank always turned soft and instead of saying,&#13;
"We're not going to make this loan until you live up to your side of the bargain," they said, "Well, you&#13;
know, you can't expect Syria"--which was one of the worst offenders--"to adhere to these agreements.&#13;
We must keep on lending."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I personally feel this is in somewhat the same category as the other problems that the Bank has&#13;
created for itself: the making of loans and the pressure to make loans and performance and volume of&#13;
lending sometimes takes precedence over concern with policies. I mean it was considered that&#13;
reporting of debt statistics is one of those unnecessary things, and why does it make much difference&#13;
whether they really do it or not? They'll grow up and do it finally. I think the Bank has not been tough&#13;
enough on this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: Well, you mean that the Bank, without formal renegotiation, may on some occasion allow a&#13;
slight slippage in the rate at which loans are repaid?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, no, no, no. We don't. But the reporting of debt statistics. There is an obligation, a&#13;
specific loan agreement obligation, that debt statistics should be reported, all foreign debt statistics.&#13;
And some countries do it.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -51-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: When you say reported, you mean published?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Reported to the Bank. There are forms. Now it's been computerized, but in the old days there&#13;
was a form they were obliged to send in, saying that they had borrowed so much from Denmark or...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Or the Bank of America?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Or the Bank of America, or even the Russian Government for that matter. And some&#13;
countries did it very religiously, some countries did it conscientiously but sloppily, some countries didn't&#13;
give a damn. And the Bank was not awfully concerned. The Bank eventually got into the business of&#13;
helping countries with organizing their systems. I'm not talking about that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Does the Bank sort of at random check on statistics by going to the Bank of America or&#13;
whatever and say, "What do you think is the obligation of that government to you?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, sometimes the Bank would get information from the newspapers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That's not a very good source.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, but if you see that there's a newspaper clipping one day in The Wall Street Journal or&#13;
whatever that country X has received a $10 million loan for a cement plant or something or other from&#13;
country Y, you keep a note in your file and you can check whether the country reports it or not.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, does OECD do a better job of keeping debt statistics?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, no. I don't think so, because the Bank is the only primary source, the only place where the&#13;
debtor countries, developing countries, are obliged to report on their indebtedness under the loan&#13;
agreements so long as the loan is outstanding, as far as I recall.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -52-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Okay. I just thought of OECD because there's a great deal of presentation on the DAC by&#13;
representatives of the individual countries about their bilateral loan and granting arrangements with...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: WeU, that's right, but you see, it was because of the coincidence of interest that the DAC was&#13;
getting it from the lender side, the Bank was getting it from the borrower side. And why not have a&#13;
more systematic arrangement where you've got both and coUated them. And then of course&#13;
subsequently this has moved on ahead since I've had anything to do with it, with the inclusion of private&#13;
debt and everything else, which was the big empty box that I was talking about.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I take it that you feel that the coUection of statistics is better now than it was 15 years ago.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Oh, I'm sure it is, yes. I would hope so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I would, too. Well, what next in this discussion of external debt shall we talk about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't know how much there is since we don't have very much time left and I don't know if you&#13;
wanted to talk about other things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Let's come back to that if we have some time, but let's spend a few minutes with your&#13;
recoUections of the Presidents under whom you've served.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. I served in technical terms under five. [John J.] McCloy was as far as I was concerned a&#13;
somewhat distant ftgure whom I had probably seen more of when I worked in the Pentagon than when&#13;
I worked in the Bank. And so I knew very little about him. I was technically here for three months&#13;
under Clausen and that doesn't really count. So basically there were three: Black, Woods and&#13;
McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Black I thought was a man with great charm, a great deal of acuteness about personal&#13;
relationships, and a man who understood his own limitations.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -53-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That's a very valuable thing for anybody.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: If you were talking about economics, he always said, "I don't understand economics, I readily&#13;
admit it. We need to have it around but I really don't understand it." He was not afraid to say that he&#13;
didn't understand, but that he didn't reject the need for economic understanding on that account. A lot&#13;
of people prefer to ignore something they don't understand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     He did something very valuable for the Bank which was very much in his line--I think it's related&#13;
to his personality--which was to put it on the map in the world's capital markets, which was no easy&#13;
thing. Someone like Dave [Davidson] Sommers would be the one to ask about this. The legal&#13;
complications, the complications of state legislation about what would be eligible investments for&#13;
insurance companies, banks and whatever, were such that an enormous amount of work was needed.&#13;
Of course initially this was in the U.S., but subsequently it extended abroad to the Dutch, the British,&#13;
the Germans after they recovered, the French--at that time the Japanese were borrowers rather than&#13;
lenders--Canada, and he made it his main job, as far as I understood it, to get the Bank in a position&#13;
where it was a borrower, a borrower who was understood by the market, a borrower who was accepted&#13;
by the markets. These days where you see articles in The Washington Post about the Bank as being&#13;
one of the big fmancial institutions in the world, this is easily forgotten. The Bank wasn't anything, it&#13;
was just a nameplate at 1818 H Street and nobody had ever heard of it and most people were very&#13;
suspicious of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     This is why I think, as I recalled yesterday, there was a lot of preoccupation about what had gone&#13;
on in the 1930s and how we hoped to make things different and how the Bank would be an instrument&#13;
in making that different but not an instrument in throwing money down the drain. And I recall that in&#13;
the time when I was working in the President's office, which was, it turns out, maiuly 1950 this was very&#13;
much the subject of whatever speeches I made for Black. I think there were a couple of them. This&#13;
was his preoccupation and I think he was extremely good at it because he had knowledge, charm,&#13;
astuteness and a great deal of dedication. He left much of the running of the Bank, per se, to ...&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -54-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: Robert Garner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Robert Garner. And I have no idea what their personal relationships were but it seemed from&#13;
the outside to be a very good arrangement. And I think, I think an enormous debt was owed to Black&#13;
on this account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: On this subject, can you say a word about the relations between Black as a person and the&#13;
representatives of Morgan Stanley and F'rrst Boston, who were the firms selected to be the major&#13;
underwriters for Bank securities?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUVER: In that context?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I have no idea.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: In that context, the relation between Black and George Woods, who as chief executive&#13;
officer, by 1953 for First Boston, I assume that he must have had a major hand in helping to market the&#13;
bonds of the Bank also?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And I have been told by people who worked in Mr. Black's office that Mr. Black might be&#13;
on the telephone to Mr. Woods several times a day, not weekly or monthly but daily.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: It's entirely possible. No, I don't know it frrst hand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Would you think it possible or probable that Woods' participation in occasional missions to&#13;
India or Pakistan might have been related to the fact that F'rrst Boston was a major underwriter for&#13;
Bank securities? Was it an attempt to get somebody from the outside, so to speak, in a position to be&#13;
able to report upon the procedures followed by the Bank in the interest of making it easier to market&#13;
the bonds? You're looking at me blankly enough that I assume that this was not a subject that was&#13;
widely talked about in the Bank in the 1950s?&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -55-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: No, I don't think so. I'll tell you one thing which may be related to this, that Black was very&#13;
much a person who created and then relied on strong personal relationships. And there were two that&#13;
I can recall. In the early days the Bank made more than one loan to Italy to the Cassa per il&#13;
Mezzogiomo which was the development fund for the south of Italy. And they had a man by the name&#13;
of Pescatore. Now Black had a very good, a strong relationship with Pescatore. Black's mode of&#13;
operation was really: here are two people who understand each other and we can work it out, that kind&#13;
of thing. And that was the sort of aegis under which the Bank was doing its work. You mentioned&#13;
Paul Rosenstein-Rodan yesterday. At a different level he and Professor Saraceno, I think it was,&#13;
organized this publication about the effects of lending and how it would have a multiplier effect in the&#13;
south if you built it up, and so on. Of course, it turned out that everybody in the south went to Milan&#13;
eventually. But that was Black's mode of operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The other one was in Iran; the name of the man was Ebtehaj. The Bank more or less created--or,&#13;
at least if it wasn't the creator it was the paternal side of the creation--the Plan Organization in Iran in&#13;
those early days. And you can see the parallel. There was the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno, which was not&#13;
the government, it was an organization; the Plan Organization was not the government, it was&#13;
something outside the government. And the man who ran that had a good relationship with Black. He&#13;
also suffered from it, as he ended up in jail at one time. And there were people seconded from the&#13;
Bank to go and work in the Plan Organization. It was under this kind of an aegis, again, that the Bank&#13;
lending to Iran took place at the time. And it took place with the Plan Organization. There's a very&#13;
close parallel between Italy and Iran in these two cases. I'm sure these were not the only two cases;&#13;
they're the two which come to mind. And it seems to me that those were two cases in which Black was&#13;
working not only on the Bank's fmancial resources side, on the Bank's borrowing side, but also on the&#13;
Bank's lending side.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And I was in Germany with him, and we had several meetings on this ill-fated question of German&#13;
borrowing in 1953. I mentioned the bicycle incident. Of course, borrowing boys' bicycles doesn't&#13;
further the relationships between governments, but you could see the way he operated with the people&#13;
we met. I mean, there were very, very formal meetings, and I think that Black got very bored with&#13;
those. But when he went to dinner, he was a different person talking to people. I think he must have&#13;
had a network. And certainly there must have been this network within the United States of people&#13;
with whom he must have had relationships.&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                        -56-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I've been told that he had certain friends in Congress, for example that he could&#13;
depend upon and was very friendly with. Particularly the Senators from Georgia. But he was also very&#13;
friendly with Fulbright.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Fulbright, yes. Now Fulbright was another. That's right. But this was the ambiente in which&#13;
he worked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, let us quiekly turn to George Woods if we may.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Well, I can't reeall exactly how much I said yesterday on this machine but we talked about him&#13;
at lunch as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: We talked about him in India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. Well, my two contacts with George Woods were over India, particularly when he carne to&#13;
visit India and secondly on his request to me to do this report on IDA policies for MeNamara. As I&#13;
said, I never had the slightest difficulty in talking to George Woods. I don't know why it was because a&#13;
lot of people hated his guts. And there were people who felt that he was quite brutal and that he was&#13;
extremely hard--I've been told--on Burke Knapp, for example. There were some people who really got&#13;
very short shrift from him.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was he vindictive as well as brutal?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: I don't know that he was vindictive. I think that he was a sort of a tough, self-made man. I&#13;
think he liked people to stand up to him. I think he didn't like it when people were not sort of straight&#13;
with him. I believe the things which people said about him may well have been true, but I simply never&#13;
had any experience of this kind myself. I may be the only person who would ever say this, but it&#13;
happens to to be true. As I mentioned, you know, I arrived at the airport late and went to his hotel&#13;
because Qantas was an hour early. Other people might have been extremely offended by this, but not&#13;
George Woods. I found him a very easy-going person. In the visit, when I accompanied him around in&#13;
Delhi and Bombay, when I discussed a subject in which he had a very strong opinion with him in&#13;
Bombay, namely the subject of exchange rates and the Bell Mission, I wouldn't say I found him&#13;
&amp;#12;B. B. KING                                         -57-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KING)&#13;
easy to argue with but I did not find that he was somebody who was irritated by the fact that somebody&#13;
had a different point of view. He was prepared to listen. He made it clear that he was hard to&#13;
convince, but he didn't mind somebody trying.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes. But the people who really disliked him or, as you say, hated him, must have felt that&#13;
he was unfair in some way as well as being gruff or insulting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes. And maybe they did. But unfortunately I cannot give you any example, I can only give&#13;
you two examples of my contact with him, on each of which, well on the first of which I gave him every&#13;
excuse to be absolutely very annoyed if he wanted to be, because of protocol. I mean, maybe I should&#13;
have stayed up all night at the airport just to be sure I was there. But he dismissed it as an absolutely&#13;
trivial incident. And on both occasions I argued about something with him. On the second occasion I&#13;
did not follow his instructions precisely and I told him why, and he accepted it. So I don't know. I&#13;
think he had a rather sort of biting manner which was meant to intimidate and in some cases did.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes. Well, I think that's a very good summary. I might just say, while you know many,&#13;
many, many more people in the Bank than I do or ever shall, I have interviewed a fair number of&#13;
people who thought that he had a good deal of charm and personally got along with him very well. So&#13;
this feeling of hatred was not universal in the Bank, though I'm well aware of the fact that it was shared&#13;
by a fair portion of the people in the Bank. It's something that I need to get at more as 1...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: That's very interesting because 1--this is the first time I hear that there were other people who&#13;
had a good impression of him. I'm glad I'm not peculiar in this respect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think we're going to have to bring this to an end, I'm sorry to say. We're just out of time&#13;
for this conversation. There's more that needs to be said.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KING: Yes, there's a great deal more that needs to be said about McNamara than can be said in two&#13;
minutes. I would like to say one thing about him, however, if you'll permit me. And that is that I&#13;
disagreed with McNamara on certain subjects from the start and, furthermore, he knew it. And&#13;
&amp;#12;"&#13;
    B. B. KING                                         Â·58-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    [KING]&#13;
    on one occasion I was at a meeting and he was talking to David Bell. He pointed to me and said, "I&#13;
    expect that Ben disagrees," even though I hadn't spoken to him. He knew that. I don't know if he&#13;
    knew the precise nature of my disagreement with him. He must have been a reasonably tolerant&#13;
    person in this respect that he was willing to tolerate the existence of disagreement. It wasn't necessarily&#13;
    that he didn't want them close to him, but he was willing to have people around who represented a&#13;
    different opinion. And I   t~   that's very important in the Bank, because if you discourage dissent&#13;
    unduly-Â·obviously people in authority don't like to have it around all the time--you'll get a soft,&#13;
    homogenized institution which is not what one wants at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER: Too wishy-washy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    KING: Much too wishy-washy. And I don't know, there are some things that are going on these days&#13;
    which make me wonder whether that may.... This is something pro-McNamara I would like to say.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER: Of course. I might just say that both of these machines will shut themselves off&#13;
    automatically if you would care to say more about McNamara and answer a question which I was going&#13;
    to ask which you alluded to yesterday: In what way has Anne Krueger changed the direction of&#13;
    economics from Hollis Chenery? I wish you would.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    KING: Let me just say one thing. From talks with many people, and from one quite significant piece&#13;
    of personal experience, or rather non-experience, I am absolutely convinced that what Anne Krueger&#13;
    has done is to cut off anybody who ever had any relationships with Hollis Chenery, per se, irrespective&#13;
    of the person's merit. And I think administratively this follows exactly from what I was saying about&#13;
    dissent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER: Indeed it is.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    KING: It is absolutely appalling. She's a well-known economist and I have no doubt about her merits,&#13;
    but I think that this should not have been permitted. I have heard also that Clausen knew it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER: This has been a most interesting interview. Thank you very much.&#13;

            In July 1986 Benjamin B. King was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1947 to 1981, Mr. King worked in the following
            areas: as chief economist (1968-1969); in the economic
            program department as senior advisor (1972-1974); as an
            advisor to the Canadian International Development Agency
            (1972-1974); as a research advisor to the vice president of
            development (1974-1977); in the development economics
            department as director (1978-1981); and as acting vice
            president for economics and research staff (1987). One of
            the first reports he wrote was on the British policies
            connected with economic development. His transcript concerns
            his projects related to African, Norway, Germany, Iraq, and
            country review policies of Hollis Chenery and Anne Krueger.
