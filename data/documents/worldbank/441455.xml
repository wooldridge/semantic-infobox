            Do the timing and type of auction affect
            the sale price? What kind of restructuring is worth doing
            before privatization? The author examines how much these and
            other factors affect privatization prices. The study shows
            that speed and competitive bidding consistently increase
            sale premiums, but that many restructuring measures such as
            absorbing debt and improving efficiency do not. The key
            lesson for policymakers: Don't do too much --just sell.
