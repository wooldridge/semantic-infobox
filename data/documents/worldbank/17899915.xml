                      Some doubt has been raised about the priority ']&#13;

&#13;
           proposed credit to Ethiopia in the amount of $23 million&#13;
&#13;
           equivalent f0r an education project.       I will ask Hr. Jalil&#13;
&#13;
           to present this to us.&#13;
&#13;
                      Go ahead, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                      !VIR. JALIL:    Hr. President, Hembers of the Board:&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopia, as you are all a\vare, is going through fundamental&#13;
&#13;
           changes reaching almost all aspects of social and economic&#13;
&#13;
           life of its people.       Within a short period of about 15&#13;
&#13;
           ;:uonths, the Government has established new social and&#13;
&#13;
           economic goals and is moving toward implementation of&#13;
&#13;
           fundamental reforms.       For the achievement of the Government's&#13;
&#13;
           objectives, perhaps no sector is more important than the&#13;
&#13;
           education sector, to which I shall limit myself in this&#13;
&#13;
           presentation.&#13;
&#13;
                      Modern educational development in Ethiopia is of&#13;
&#13;
           recent origin -- it started about 30 years ago and, from a&#13;
&#13;
           very low base, made rapid progress at all levels of formal&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                         97&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           education.    However, in 1972, a comprehensive review of the&#13;
&#13;
           sector conducted by the Ethiopians, with assistance from the&#13;
&#13;
           Bank Group, concluded that the education system had basically&#13;
&#13;
           produced middle and high-level administrative and managerial&#13;
&#13;
           nanpower, but had neglected the rural areas where 90 percent&#13;
&#13;
           of the Ethiopian population live.    Only about 7 percent of&#13;
&#13;
           the people were literate, as compared to 19 percent in Sudan       nd&#13;
&#13;
           30 percent in Kenya; the primary school participation rate wa&#13;
&#13;
           20 percent as compared to about 25 percent in Sudan and 67&#13;
&#13;
           per cent in Kenya.    There were large inequalities between urb n&#13;
&#13;
           and rural areas and between various regions.    For example,&#13;
&#13;
           three out of the country's 14 provinces, each with a populati n&#13;
&#13;
           of 2 million, had only one senior secondary school.     The&#13;
&#13;
           educational curricula v1ere often not relevant to job&#13;
&#13;
           requirements.    Also, Government recurrent expenditure on&#13;
&#13;
           education in 1972 amounted to about 20 percent of Government'&#13;
&#13;
           total expenditures and was still rising.&#13;
&#13;
                        'rhe new Government wishes to initiate fundamental&#13;
&#13;
           changes in educational curricula, costs and structure and,&#13;
&#13;
           in line with its policy to decentralize administration and to&#13;
&#13;
           emphasize rural development, make a determined thrust into&#13;
&#13;
           the rural areas to rapidly improve education, skills and&#13;
&#13;
           productivity.   The Goverrunent has associated teachers,&#13;

                                                                       98&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           students and other concerned groups in designing and&#13;
&#13;
           implementing the new strategy and there is now a wide measure&#13;
&#13;
           of consensus behind the education reform program.&#13;
&#13;
                       The project before you is the first attempt in&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopia to link education plans to an integrated program of&#13;
&#13;
           rural   regeneration.   It is not more of the same again.        The&#13;
&#13;
           project would facilitate development of relevant primary&#13;
&#13;
           education and skills in the rural areas and an infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
           for coordinated rural development in association with local&#13;
&#13;
           representatives.   In accordance with criteria for site&#13;
&#13;
           locations agreed with the Government, the secondary schools&#13;
&#13;
           included in the project would be located in districts which&#13;
&#13;
           presently do not have secondary schools and the primary&#13;
&#13;
           schools would be located in remote rural areas without&#13;
&#13;
           primary schools; 80 percent of the primary school sites \vould&#13;
&#13;
           be accessible only by mule.    The proposed community skill-&#13;
&#13;
           training centers would introduce improved technology to a&#13;
&#13;
           variety of rural crafts and skills, train rural adolescents&#13;
&#13;
           for self-employment and provide skill-training in support of&#13;
&#13;
           rural public works programs.    Specialized workers in&#13;
&#13;
           agricultural cooperatives, forestry, health and home&#13;
&#13;
           economics would be produced in larger numbers and revisions            f&#13;
&#13;
           curricula and textbooks at all levels and retraining of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           teachers would be undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
                      Upon completion of the project, \ve expect the&#13;
&#13;
           primary level participation rate to be increased from the&#13;
&#13;
           current 20 percent rate to about 40 percent, and inequities i&#13;
&#13;
           the regional distribution of educational opportunities to be&#13;
&#13;
           reduced.   Implementation prospects are good and project&#13;
&#13;
           implementation agencies which are experienced are being furthe&#13;
&#13;
           strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
                      Such an ambitious program can only be carried out&#13;
&#13;
           if the greatest efforts are made to economize and stretch&#13;
&#13;
           available resources to the maximma extent possible.        The&#13;
&#13;
           Government has plans for cost-reduction measures through simp&#13;
&#13;
           building designs, maximum utilization of local materials and&#13;
&#13;
           labor, and public contributions to expansion and maintenance&#13;
&#13;
           of the physical facilities.     He propose to review the&#13;
&#13;
           Government's plans and the program of their implementation&#13;
&#13;
           and assist them to keep expenditures in the sector to a&#13;
&#13;
           reasonable proportion of e1e Government's resources.&#13;
&#13;
                      In   sw~ary,   this project, which would break new&#13;
&#13;
           ground, would be a significant step forward in making the&#13;
&#13;
           education system more relevant to Ethiopia's socio-economic&#13;
&#13;
           needs and the Government's objectives and priorities.&#13;

                        DR. SK-J:      Hr. Chairman, I would like to congratula e&#13;
&#13;
            t.i1e staff for preparing and presenting to us this excellent&#13;
&#13;
            and innovative project, and I would like to congratulate 1Â·lr.&#13;
&#13;
            Jalil for a fine presentation.          In fact, Hr. Chairman, this&#13;
&#13;
            is the kind of project, education project, that I have been&#13;
&#13;
            looking for all these years.          I think that the discussion&#13;
&#13;
           that we had in the Board on education in general and on           non-&#13;
&#13;
           fonnal education sometime back, these discussions have been&#13;
&#13;
           useful, and I think this is a product of those policy papers.&#13;
&#13;
                        I would like this kind of project to be repeated&#13;
&#13;
           in other countries, and from that point of view, I feel that&#13;
&#13;
           this is a project which should be very carefully studied and&#13;
&#13;
           we should try to learn what lessons we can learn from an&#13;
&#13;
           experiment of this kind, this very comprehensive approach to&#13;
&#13;
           education, general education, and particularly to nonformal&#13;
&#13;
           education.    And this nonforn1al education part is particularly&#13;
&#13;
           especially innovative.&#13;
&#13;
                        I note vlith special interest what has been provided&#13;
&#13;
           here for radio education, in curriculum development and radio&#13;
&#13;
           program development.        There is not much experience in this&#13;
&#13;
           area in the world, only in a few countries they have tried tha .&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL                                                   101&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           So I would like to get some more information as to what&#13;
&#13;
           steps are being taken to develop the right kind of curriculum&#13;
&#13;
           and radio program, and also whether this radio program will&#13;
&#13;
           be supplemented by correspondence courses and whether this&#13;
&#13;
           education, this nonformal education part will be in future&#13;
&#13;
           extended to other areas.   This has made a beginning in a&#13;
&#13;
           limited area, but nonformal education is important not only&#13;
&#13;
           to provide education to people who cannot attend schools, but&#13;
&#13;
           also to provide education to the adults.    &amp;~d   nonformal&#13;
&#13;
           education is a way of providing opportunity for life-long&#13;
&#13;
           education to some of the people.&#13;
&#13;
                      So I would like to know what special action and&#13;
&#13;
           steps are being taken to develop e1is curriculum of radio&#13;
&#13;
           program development, and also what arrangements will be made&#13;
&#13;
           to keep this under study with a view to applying the lessons&#13;
&#13;
           to other countries, because I feel that this program will be&#13;
&#13;
           of great interest to a number of other developing countries.&#13;

           be supplemented by correspondence courses?           ~ilill   the nonforrna&#13;

           history in Ethiopia.         It has been there for 15 years, and&#13;
&#13;
           there are two stations, coverage is limited to about 200&#13;
&#13;
           schools.   Under this project we want to extend i t to about&#13;
&#13;
           11 stations and most primary and secondary schools.&#13;
&#13;
                       It has been receiving bilateral assistance, mainly&#13;
&#13;
           from the British ODI,'i., in developing the course content and&#13;
&#13;
           curricula, and it employs local teachers and educationists&#13;
&#13;
           in developing the course content.           It has done, as far as&#13;
&#13;
           our present mission found, good work in science, mathematics,&#13;
&#13;
           and the like, but for further details I would request, sir,&#13;
&#13;
           that we call on Ptr. Loken.&#13;
&#13;
                      HR. iÂ·1cNANARA:      Surely.     Hr. Loken.&#13;
&#13;
                      Ivffi.   LOKEN:   Mr. Chairman, as i-.â&#128;¢I r. Jalil has just&#13;
&#13;
           it is not a new program, it is simply an extension of an exisÂ·&#13;
&#13;
           ing program, and they do have considerable expertise in the&#13;
&#13;
           country, not only the local       peo~le,    Lut also some very, very&#13;
&#13;
           good, very experienced men on the development of rauio&#13;
&#13;
           programs and on the development of course materials.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                        103 . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       In the third education project we did provide assi -&#13;
&#13;
           tance to help them on their basic development of curriculum&#13;
&#13;
           reform.   And this is heavily aimed at the mathematics and&#13;
&#13;
           the acience fields.     But that program has been evolving&#13;
&#13;
           over the last three years.     They have over 150 people now&#13;
&#13;
           working on the curriculum reform or changes, and they are&#13;
&#13;
           very, very far along.     They hope to get their first four-year&#13;
&#13;
           primary school materials together by the end of this coming&#13;
&#13;
           year, and we have looked over the materials produced so far&#13;
&#13;
           and they are excellent.     So we feel no hesitation at all in&#13;
&#13;
            the curriculum or in the radio areas.&#13;
&#13;
                       Now, as the rural education programs develop,&#13;
&#13;
           the radio program and a related correspondence program will&#13;
&#13;
           get more heavily into what we now call nonformal.     And they&#13;
&#13;
           will begin to get into health education, into sanitation, int&#13;
&#13;
            a whole variety of related farmer-training programs, via the&#13;
&#13;
            radio.   But that is in the process now of being developed.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McNAMARA:    Thank you, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                        There is one other innovative feature that Or. Sen&#13;
&#13;
            didn't mention but I am sure he noticed, and that is the&#13;
&#13;
            increased emphasis to be placed on female attendance.       This&#13;
&#13;
            is an example, not by any means the worst skewing, but of an&#13;
&#13;
            extensive maldistribution of places.    I have forgotten the&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                           104&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           exact figures, I think I calculated that the males in primary&#13;
&#13;
           school were 28 percent of the age group and the females about&#13;
&#13;
           12 percent, something like that, and it is that kind of a&#13;
&#13;
           problem -vihich has great impact on the developing countries an&#13;
&#13;
           which affects such subjects as population planning.&#13;
&#13;
                        Dr. Ballantine, &gt;vould you conunent on \vhether this&#13;
&#13;
           is an exception, or can we expect other nonformal education&#13;
&#13;
           projects for other countries?&#13;
&#13;
                        L'1R.   BALLANTINE:   Mr. Chairman, I am glad to say&#13;
&#13;
           it's not an exception entirely, although I have to say i t is&#13;
&#13;
           a good example. This Ethiopian project         is the first one in&#13;
&#13;
           Ethiopia since the well-known education sector review in&#13;
&#13;
           which they took a deep look at the system and came up with&#13;
&#13;
           a number, as is explained in this, a number of very subsÂ·tanti&#13;
                                a&#13;
           proposals for reformr/few of which vlere modified by the new&#13;
&#13;
           Government, but the basic pattern remains.         So the opportunit&#13;
&#13;
           existed and the understanding existed between us as donors&#13;
&#13;
           and they as borrowers to proceed along fairly substantial&#13;
&#13;
           innovative lines.&#13;
&#13;
                        Now, I just happened to notice this morning a&#13;
&#13;
           figure of a little analysis we had run.        This doesn't refer&#13;
&#13;
           particularly to nonformal education, but it does to rural&#13;
&#13;
           education.    And we had examined some 20 or 25 of the more&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL                                                    105&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           recent projects that the Board has passed or is about to see,&#13;
&#13;
           in the education sector, -.;vi th a view to whether they had&#13;
&#13;
           50 percent or more of the funds devoted to rural education.&#13;
&#13;
           And just under 50 percent of those projects had over 50&#13;
&#13;
           percent devoted to rural populations.&#13;
&#13;
                         So I think very definitely there is a movement&#13;
&#13;
            in the direction, in the actual lending and project formation&#13;
&#13;
            in the direction of the lines laid down in the sector policy&#13;
&#13;
            paper.&#13;
&#13;
                         One other statistic, as you know, Hr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
           we are conducting a review of the lending program, and we&#13;
&#13;
            find that in the program for 1975-79 as compared with the&#13;
&#13;
            program for '74-78 vlhich \vas included in the sector paper,&#13;
&#13;
            there is a shift upwards in the lending for basic and&#13;
&#13;
            primary education from 27 percent estimated for the five-&#13;
&#13;
            year period to 40 percent in the field of basic and primary&#13;
&#13;
            education.&#13;
&#13;
                         HR. McNNÂ·'lARA:   And within that field there is a&#13;
&#13;
            shift, I am sure, towards the rural area, but I point out th&#13;
&#13;
            although 50 percent of the projects Dr. Ballantine was&#13;
&#13;
            Â·talking about would have at least 50 percent of the money&#13;
&#13;
            going for rural education.       At least 70 percent of the peopl&#13;
&#13;
            are in those areas in 100 percent of the projects.&#13;

                               NR. BALLAN'l'INE:           Yes.&#13;
&#13;
                               râ&#128;¢lR. jvlc~~AlÂ·'lARl\.:   So He haven It I at least in these&#13;
&#13;
                 very rough macro terms, we haven't gone as far probably as&#13;
&#13;
                 we and others should.&#13;
&#13;
                               One of the great characteristics of the developing&#13;
&#13;
                 world is a maldistribution of educational services between&#13;
&#13;
                 urban and rural areas, and there is no question in my mind&#13;
&#13;
                 but What eLiS is affecting distribution of population,&#13;
&#13;
                 distribution of income, quality of life.&#13;
&#13;
                                lÂ·1R. BALLANTINE:          I   should add one raore point to&#13;
&#13;
                 give a balanced statement of the case, f'!r. Chairman, that&#13;
&#13;
                 you recall and the Board may recall that in table 6 of that&#13;
&#13;
                 paper tl1ere were statistics indicating the amount of money&#13;
&#13;
                 w.;;   expected to lend per capita, and thaÂ·t was grouped in the&#13;
&#13;
                 five different income groups that we had used throughout the&#13;
&#13;
                 paper, the two lovver being below $250 per capita.                 i\nd&#13;
&#13;
                 that table shovled that there was certainly a bias, vle were&#13;
&#13;
                 lending more to the relatively affluent countries, and vve&#13;
&#13;
                 haven't eliminated that in the new calculation.                  There are&#13;
&#13;
                 certain      built-in factors we haven't really got our finger&#13;
&#13;
                 on yet.&#13;
&#13;
                                t-IR. HcN.Ar1ARl-\.:     One otJ.1er point that is worthy of&#13;
&#13;
                 mention for those Direcotrs who were not members of the Doard&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY ' ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                       107&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           at the time we started the nonfor.mal education research.&#13;
&#13;
           We initiated a major project in the world on nonformal&#13;
&#13;
           education research, and this Bank financed the cost to the&#13;
&#13;
           extent of what, Duncan, maybe $400,000?&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. BALLANTINE:    Ultimately $300,000.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. McNAMARA:     $300,000 of research in nonformal&#13;
&#13;
           education simply because of our belief that in the long run,&#13;
&#13;
           and particularly for a society such as Ethiopia, there is&#13;
&#13;
           no other answer to their problem.     7 percent literacy, as&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Jalil said, that means 93 percent are illiterate.&#13;
&#13;
           80 percent of the children 6 to 11 years old are not in&#13;
&#13;
           school.   In the year 2000, at least 85 percent of the people&#13;
&#13;
           are going to be illiterate.    There is no way to deal with&#13;
&#13;
           that other than through nonformal education.     So Mr.&#13;
&#13;
           Ballantine and his associates have been working on this&#13;
&#13;
           problem, and I will guarantee you we will have other proj ect&#13;
&#13;
           of this kind before you.&#13;
&#13;
                      Dr. Sen.&#13;
&#13;
                      DR. SEN:   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much&#13;
&#13;
           the statements we have just now heard from Dr. Ballantine&#13;
&#13;
           and his two associates.    I appreciate also your comment that&#13;
&#13;
           if we have to lift the lower 40 percent, well, education&#13;
&#13;
           has the most important role to play.     And that is why I am&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                         108&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           very much heartened by this project.     It is a most welcome&#13;
&#13;
           project.     And this leads me to comment that that is why I am&#13;
&#13;
           concerned about what was done in Kenya, because maybe the&#13;
&#13;
           financial experts, the people in the elite, they in Kenya&#13;
&#13;
           thought that, well, primary education, rural education,&#13;
&#13;
           could be slowed down.&#13;
&#13;
                        In Kenya, if education budget was cut down by&#13;
&#13;
           cutting down the universities or higher education, well, I&#13;
&#13;
           would have less concern.&#13;
&#13;
                        I was wondering, in countries like Kenya where&#13;
&#13;
           due to financial and other considerations education budget&#13;
&#13;
           has to be cut down, Hhether introduction of the kind of&#13;
&#13;
           educational policy that we are seeing in Ethiopia would&#13;
&#13;
           llelp at least to minimize the damage, whether the Bank has&#13;
&#13;
           given some thought to that.&#13;
&#13;
                        Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                        HR. HcNANARA:   Yes, I think the answer is&#13;
&#13;
           definitely yes, Dr. Sen.     We find in many, many developing&#13;
&#13;
           countries an imbalance not only between rural and urban areas&#13;
&#13;
           in education, but between university education and primary&#13;
&#13;
           education.    Dr. Ballantine has emphasized on many occasions&#13;
&#13;
           the necessity for redressing that balance, and particularly&#13;
&#13;
           that is the case where the rate of growth of an educational&#13;

                                 highly conunendable project, which is very much in line with&#13;

                                 all our thinking here and our policies and ideas on nonformal&#13;

&#13;
                                 support the land reform program which we have on the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                 strongly of the need in Ethiopia.&#13;

                                               I notice, for instance, in the program listed in&#13;
&#13;
                                 Annex 3, page 2, where the social science center is includeu&#13;
&#13;
                                 at quite a sizable amount, so far as the project is concerned,&#13;
&#13;
                                 $1.97 million.      This I really \.-onder hovr this does fit into&#13;

                                 the overall program that we have here which is, of course, a&#13;
&#13;
                                 nonformal educational prograrn and really related to rural&#13;
&#13;
                                 education.    And I think it really follows very much the point&#13;
&#13;
                                 that was just made on the balance we are really striking.&#13;
&#13;
                                 And particularly when one gets back to finding out what \ve&#13;
&#13;
                                 are really trying to do in the social science center and that&#13;
&#13;
                                 seems to be merely a consolidation of buildings or of program,&#13;
&#13;
                                 really, construction operation which really doesn't seem to&#13;
&#13;
                                 take us a great deal further in the educational field.&#13;
&#13;
                                              :t-1y second point of, well, I might say concern, and&#13;
&#13;
                                 this relates more generally to rionformal education projects.&#13;
&#13;
                                 \oile are taking on here a very wide range of services here,&#13;
&#13;
                                 all vlhich I thoroughly commend and applaud, but i t does&#13;
&#13;
                                 raise the obvious question about how are we going to implement&#13;
&#13;
                                 the supervision'?   What is the degree of coordination here?&#13;
&#13;
                                 Of course, what is very relevant, Hr. Chairman, is the fact,&#13;
&#13;
                                 of course, if we look back we find in the second education&#13;
&#13;
                                 project and the third education, we do have some lags, and&#13;
&#13;
                                 I do notice that we are trying to build in some strength into&#13;
&#13;
                                 our implementation program.&#13;
&#13;
                                              But to come back to the first point that when:! vle&#13;
&#13;
                                 are putting in $1.97 million into social science center, I&#13;
&#13;
                                 would have much preferred to have seen a stronger element into&#13;

                                                Hr. Jalil, first on social science, why $1.97 milli n?&#13;
&#13;
                                   Hnat are they buying in terms of development for that?&#13;
&#13;
                                                HR. JALIL:    It is Â·true that this amount will really&#13;
&#13;
                                   be used in constructing a buildirig       which will consolidate&#13;
&#13;
                                   tile various social science faculties in one group, in one&#13;
&#13;
                                   building, together with        a development research center tvhich&#13;
&#13;
                                   conducts basic research which is rural oriented.&#13;
&#13;
                                                So the request from the Government with regard to&#13;
&#13;
                                   the social science center is also a very old pending request&#13;
&#13;
                                   and we had our own worries with regard to the priority of&#13;

                                   this item.    i.loweve r, this -- they call it a na tiona 1 uni ve rs it&#13;

&#13;
                                   this country is short of high quality manpower.          The Government&#13;
&#13;
                                   has novl included a large part of the economy in the public&#13;
&#13;
                                   sector, the Goverrunent is decentralizing the administration,&#13;
&#13;
                                   it's sending to    ~1e   rural areas and the regions very many&#13;

                                   Ethiopian development is important, even for execution of&#13;

                                   things like land reform and rural development.&#13;
&#13;
                                               So I think these buildings -- these are really&#13;
&#13;
                                   dilapidated, the buildings that were there were dilapidated.&#13;
&#13;
                                   It could not house for any amount of time 700 students that&#13;

                                   make use of it, 5,000 extension students in the evening that&#13;
&#13;
                                   make use of it.     And on balance, we think that Â·this inclusion&#13;

                                   is not an unreasonable inclusion in the light of Ethiopian&#13;

                                 Ethiopia realizes the development advantage that the project&#13;
&#13;
                                 is intended to give.       It goes back to Dr. Sen's emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
                                 ne'"' projects, new initiatives.    And Dr. Ballantine's indicatio&#13;

                                 of experimentation, we are undertaking the emphasis on primary&#13;
&#13;
                                 schools.   Is this contributing to development?      Education is&#13;
&#13;
                                 good in itself, but that is not why \ve are financing it.      And&#13;
&#13;
                                 we are going to have to introduce more follow-up into our&#13;

                                 to the use of tracers, and that simply means evaluation of the&#13;

                                 to that by the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
                                               HR. GREEN:    Hr. Chairman, we certainly actively&#13;
&#13;
                                 support this project as a very good effort to assist in&#13;
&#13;
                                 spreading education, particularly amongst the rural poor,&#13;
&#13;
                                 and we commend the way the project is being developed by the&#13;
&#13;
                                 Government of Ethiopia and the way the international community&#13;
&#13;
                                 has helped.&#13;
&#13;
                                               I notice in the papers that the survey that was&#13;
&#13;
                                 made in 1972 or initiated in 1972, had been done with assistan e&#13;
&#13;
                                 from the IDA funds, and I heard Dr. Ballantine say that most&#13;

&#13;
                                         of the   reco~nendations   had been carried out.   One of the&#13;
                                 I&#13;
&#13;
                             !I          fairly important ones is mentioned here and that       was the&#13;
&#13;
                                         reduction of the primary school cycle from six years to four&#13;
&#13;
                                         years was not approved at that time, and in view of the size&#13;
&#13;
                                         of the education budget in the total government revenues absor ing&#13;
&#13;
                                         20 percent and the still very, very great needs to spread the&#13;
&#13;
                                         education system as widely as possible, I am wondering what&#13;
&#13;
                                         are the implications of not having adopted that particular&#13;
&#13;
                                         recommendation of the survey.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      My second question is prompted partly by the remark&#13;
&#13;
                                         made by I!lr. Al-Atrash and Hr. Sen earlier in relation to Kenya&#13;
&#13;
                                         the way they remarked that the education sector has a very tin&#13;
&#13;
                                         foreign exchange segment, that we notice in this project if&#13;
&#13;
                                         you add in the total effort running up to about $30 or is it&#13;
&#13;
                                         $34 million-odd, $35 million-odd, that 30 percent of it is in&#13;
&#13;
                                         foreign exchange.    What is the implication of this for otJ:1er&#13;
&#13;
                                         projects in this sort of field in countries at this low level&#13;
&#13;
                                         of development?     Is the ansvver that the project is pretty tiny&#13;
&#13;
                                         in relation to the total education budget in a place like&#13;
&#13;
                                         Ethiopia?    Or are v:1e going to see fairly heavy increments of&#13;
&#13;
                                         foreign exchange in these sort of projects?&#13;

                                                   MR. JALIL:   Frankly, sir, nothing.   The sector revi w&#13;
&#13;
                                     had recommended a 4 plus 4 plus 4, which means 4 years of&#13;
&#13;
                                     terminal education followed by a junior secondary level of&#13;
&#13;
                                     4 years and a senior secondary level of 4 years, instead of&#13;
&#13;
                                     what was the opinion at that time and what continues to be&#13;
&#13;
                                     a 6-year primary cycle.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   In terms of total number of school years, it does&#13;
&#13;
                                     not mean much.     However, behind the sector review recommendati n,&#13;
&#13;
                                     the idea was for most rural young children, education would&#13;
&#13;
                                     terminate at what they call a minimum formation education of&#13;
&#13;
                                     4 years, and beyond which they would go into life and&#13;
&#13;
                                     activities.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   However, there has been a lot of misunderstanding&#13;
&#13;
                                     among the students, teachers, and parents       about this&#13;
&#13;
                                     particular recommendation of the sector review, and perhaps&#13;
&#13;
                                     the feeling was that education is being reserved for the elite&#13;
&#13;
                                     and for urban dwellers,and for village people and rural&#13;
&#13;
                                     people the period of available education in primary schools&#13;
&#13;
                                     is being shortened.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   In spite of that, the Government is keeping in view&#13;
&#13;
                                     ultimately to implement the sector review recommendations and&#13;
&#13;
                                     the schools that we are helping to build would have four&#13;
&#13;
                                     classrooms, not six.       Perhaps at a later stage, the real&#13;

                                      exchange content averages at least 30 percent, but one&#13;
&#13;
                                      implication is that we frequently do local cost financing on&#13;

               think, that we have approved in recent months for Ethiopia&#13;

               with the total amount coming to I believe $70 million or a&#13;

               little more.   And this, too, on top of quite a few projects&#13;
&#13;
               approved in the last two or three years, rather few of which&#13;
&#13;
               seem to me, at least looking at the disbursement record&#13;
&#13;
               in Annex 2,to progress very far, yet.    And I am simply wonder&#13;
&#13;
               ing therefore whether you could give us some assurance that w&#13;
&#13;
               are not pressing at the moment beyond Ethiopia's present&#13;
&#13;
               capacity to soundly implement projects in this magnitude?&#13;

                         MR. McNAMARA:   Yes.   Mr. Reynolds, this, of course,&#13;

                         Mr. Husain has very carefully watched that and he&#13;
&#13;
               and Mr. Knapp and I discussed together the likelihood that it&#13;
&#13;
               will affect implementation of both our past projects and any&#13;

               future projects we may be considering.&#13;
&#13;
                         So Mr. Husain, would you describe to the Board&#13;
&#13;
               your appraisal of the present --&#13;
&#13;
                         MR. HUSAIN:      Vie   have, Mr. Chairman, in the last yea&#13;
&#13;
               made a very careful study, careful and continuing study of&#13;
&#13;
               the situation in Ethiopia.       We have focused especially at&#13;
&#13;
               two or three issues.&#13;
&#13;
                         One, in this period of fundamental change, and I&#13;
&#13;
               think what is happening in Ethiopia is fundamental change be-&#13;
&#13;
               cause an old established order, it was a stable order, is bein&#13;
&#13;
               replaced by something we don't know. And we wont know for a&#13;
&#13;
               long, long time to come.&#13;
&#13;
                         Obviously the old values, old institutions are chang&#13;
&#13;
               ing, the entire institution of feudalism which had been the&#13;
                                                 '&#13;
               basis of the Ethiopian sociefty is changing, rew relationships&#13;
&#13;
               are being created, new demands are being placed on the govern-&#13;
                                                                                      !&#13;
               ment machinery.&#13;
&#13;
                         The new rulers of Ethiopia stand faceless.        There&#13;
&#13;
               have been extermination of a substantial part of the higher&#13;

arc 3          in government institutions.&#13;
&#13;
                            So in this situation basically we have              to ask&#13;
&#13;
               ourselves two questions:     One,   is meaningful economic develo -&#13;
&#13;
               ment likely and possible in a situation like this?                     And&#13;
&#13;
               secondly, what is the prospect for the implementation of Bank&#13;
&#13;
               projects, Bank-IDA projects         IDA projects in this situation.&#13;
&#13;
                            Now, on the first issue, there are things to be said! m&#13;
&#13;
               two sides.     There is the civil war in   c-   t   d- \-Â·((â&#128;¢, which    makes it&#13;
&#13;
               difficult if not impossible to undertake, for the government&#13;
&#13;
               to undertake any meaningful economic effort in                / \ ;rÂ·\Â·C'C~,&#13;
&#13;
        ''&#13;
                            But if one looks at the rest of the country, despite&#13;
&#13;
               the                 issue, the government has not been oblivious&#13;
&#13;
               to economic and developmental issues.&#13;
&#13;
                            I think one of the most significant things it has&#13;
&#13;
               done is land reform. It will place tremendous burden on the&#13;
&#13;
               government machinery.It will invoke tremendous opposition&#13;
&#13;
               from the entrenched feudal class.      And yet this thing has&#13;
&#13;
               been overdue.&#13;
&#13;
                            It should have been done a long time ago,                 the&#13;
&#13;
               change of relationship between the cultivator and land and&#13;
&#13;
               the produce/ of the land.&#13;
&#13;
                            So this is a fundamental economic change.&#13;
&amp;#12;  STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
arc 4                     Secondly, we are heartened by what the government is&#13;
&#13;
             trying to do on the education side.     As you will remember,&#13;
&#13;
             the earlier seeds of discontent more than a year ago started&#13;
&#13;
             with the issues on education, so the government has shown a&#13;
&#13;
             fair amount of courage, in assuming this issue.&#13;
&#13;
                          So it is our feeling that despite violence in     a&#13;
                                                                                 '&#13;
             part of the country,     despite disorder in a part of the countrt,&#13;
&#13;
             there is a basic undercurrent of concern with the welfare of        I&#13;
             the modern-day Ethiopians.     In some cases this current is&#13;
&#13;
             broader than it has been in the past.     There is concern with&#13;
&#13;
             the larger part of the population of Ethiopia than had been&#13;
&#13;
             in the past.&#13;
&#13;
                          The economic decision maKing was paralyzed for awhilr,&#13;
&#13;
             but again in our day-to-day contact and dialogue we find that /&#13;
&#13;
             it is reviving, the politicians and the civil servants a .c e&#13;
&#13;
             making decisions affecting projects and programs and issues.&#13;
&#13;
                          Bank projects, Bank projects, the implementation of&#13;
&#13;
             Bank projects, our experience has been mixed with Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
             as in most of the countries that I deal with.&#13;
&#13;
                          This is partly a function of the institutions, part-&#13;
&#13;
              ly a function of the quality of manpower, the skills and&#13;
&#13;
              training.&#13;
&#13;
                          But the implementation of projects in Ethiopia on&#13;
&amp;#12;    STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
arc 5           an average has not been slow or worse than in most       African&#13;
&#13;
                countries.&#13;
&#13;
                             One of the reasons for the large undisbursed&#13;
&#13;
                amounts here is that our lending to Ethiopia has been built up&#13;
&#13;
                very substantially in the past two or three years, so most&#13;
&#13;
                of the proJects are at least recent, and therefore the dis-&#13;
&#13;
                bursements will take their normal course.&#13;
&#13;
                             It doesn't mean we are not facing difficulties.       We&#13;
&#13;
                are facing difficulty in some proJects.     But if one&#13;
&#13;
                balances all the factors together, it was our Judgment that&#13;
&#13;
                one should proceed with the normal work in Ethiopia, that at&#13;
&#13;
                the time when the sort of changes that are taking place and&#13;
&#13;
                some of these changes in a desirable direction, the with-&#13;
&#13;
                drawal of IDA lending, or the suspension oi' IDA lending&#13;
&#13;
                would be in many ways a signal to the progressive elements,&#13;
&#13;
                people who are trying for economic change -- they should not            e&#13;
&#13;
                trying for economic change.&#13;
&#13;
                             So most of the ploJects we are working with are&#13;
&#13;
                a part of this effort to broaden the economic base, the educa&#13;
&#13;
                tion proJect is an excellent example of how the government is&#13;
&#13;
                trying to broaden this economic base and our assistance in it.&#13;
&#13;
                             We shall keep the situation under very careful obse va-&#13;
&#13;
                tion.   We have a resident mission in Ethiopia consisting of&#13;
&amp;#12; STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                          1'' /&#13;

             in Ethiopia, preparation of projectsj but, of course, as we&#13;

&#13;
                           MR. McNAMARA:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                           I think Ethiopia, both as it was before the politica&#13;
&#13;
             change and as it has been since, illustrates one of our most&#13;
&#13;
             difficult problems.&#13;
&#13;
                           Mr. Husain characterized it before the political&#13;
&#13;
             change as a feudal society.       Certainly the necessity for land&#13;
&#13;
            reform was clear.       It was questionable whether maJor economic&#13;
&#13;
             progress could be made without it.&#13;
&#13;
                           We considered terminating lending until it occurred,&#13;
&#13;
             it appeared to be such a fundamental requirement.&#13;
&#13;
                           But it seemed unlikely that it could occur without&#13;
&#13;
            maJor political change.&#13;
&#13;
                          We pressed on the government the necessity for land&#13;
&#13;
            ref on;: ,   but we were not sufficiently persuasive or they weren't&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
arc 7      sufficiently powerful to carry it out without the major&#13;
&#13;
            political change.&#13;
&#13;
                        In any event, because of the--I will call it the&#13;
&#13;
            feudal character of the society, we seriously question :~&#13;
&#13;
           whether we should continue lending before the change.        Any&#13;
&#13;
            change that might occur of sufficient magnitude to make --&#13;
&#13;
            overthrow the feudal characteristics of that society possible&#13;
&#13;
           was almost certain to be disorderly.&#13;
&#13;
                        The change has occurred.   It has been disorderly.     I&#13;
&#13;
            is disorderly.     It has brought about land reform.   Should we&#13;
&#13;
            now terminate lending?&#13;
&#13;
                        These are very important questions and by phrasing&#13;
&#13;
            them I don't mean to suggest the answer is clear.&#13;
&#13;
                        But we have concluded that even thoughfuere is&#13;
&#13;
            dis order     and even perhaps worse than the disorder, there is&#13;
&#13;
            uncertainty -- we can't predict what the situation will be&#13;
&#13;
            tomorrow, or certainly not during the years of implementation&#13;
&#13;
            of this proJect.     But we have concluded that so long as it          1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           appears to us that the economic policies are moving the countrr&#13;
&#13;
            in the right direction, and so long as our proJect is ciosely&#13;
&#13;
           associated with those, and so long as there is a reasonable&#13;
&#13;
            probability though certainly not a certainty     that it can be&#13;

            implemented, we should present it to you and that is the basis/&#13;

&#13;
               one relates to curriculum development embracing revision of&#13;
                                                                        /&#13;
               both primary and secondary school curriculaj, which would&#13;
&#13;
                place emphases on practical subjects such as agriculture,&#13;
&#13;
               handicraft, commercial training.       It is also, let me say&#13;
&#13;
                this revision will be carried out by qualified teachers&#13;
&#13;
               selected from the schools and training will also be given to&#13;
&#13;
                the teachers in the use of the new teaching material.&#13;
&#13;
                          This is a very worth while effort and would make&#13;
&#13;
                teaching in schools more relevant to the environment of&#13;
&#13;
                the students concerned.&#13;
&#13;
                          The question is whether there is a sufficient sup-&#13;
&#13;
                ply of teachers of tre type required for the revision of the&#13;
&#13;
                curricula( and the writing of new textbooks and also for the&#13;

                          In the Ethiopian   project~    I know that attempts are&#13;
&#13;
              to be made to reduce the cost of providing education and at&#13;
&#13;
              the same   time~   to improve the quality.    However, an expansion&#13;
&#13;
              program in education is inevitably associated with substantia&#13;
&#13;
              increase in recurrent costs whenthe program is completed.&#13;
&#13;
                          The question I want to raise here is whether ade-&#13;
&#13;
              quate provisions have been made by the Ethiopian authorities&#13;
&#13;
              for increased recurrent costs so that the programs can be&#13;
&#13;
              maintained and whether such increase is within the budgetary&#13;
&#13;
              capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
                          In fact, this question has a more general applicati n&#13;
&#13;
              in education projects.&#13;
&#13;
                          In asking this question, I would like to emphasize&#13;
&#13;
              that I am strongly ins upport of expanding both the quality&#13;
&#13;
              as well as the quantity of education in developing countries.&#13;

               question,    I would request you to call Mr. Loken.&#13;

                           MR. McNAMARA:     Sure.&#13;

&#13;
                           MR. LOKEN:   Mr. Chairman, in the preceding two pro-&#13;

               proJect items onteacher training are Just now getting under&#13;

               way, that is the construction is Just now starting.&#13;
&#13;
                           The combined results of these new institutions will ,&#13;
&#13;
               if anything, give them an oversupply of primary teachers.&#13;
&#13;
                           It depends entirely on how fast the self-help&#13;
&#13;
               primary school building proJects get under way. If they are&#13;
&#13;
               only able to build the school s that are included in our out-&#13;
&#13;
               line of the project here plus those which will be        bui~by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               the Swedish program by 1980, there will begin to be an over-&#13;
&#13;
               supply.&#13;
&#13;
                           So there is no question of the numbers of trained&#13;
&#13;
               primary teachers.&#13;
&#13;
                           Secondly, they are reducing the number of years of&#13;
&#13;
               training for the primary school teachers, bringing them in at&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
arc 11       a slightly lower level of previous education, which in turn&#13;
&#13;
             will have the effect of reducing the salary levels, which give&#13;
&#13;
             you more teachers at a little less cost than has been the&#13;
&#13;
             case he ret of ore.&#13;
&#13;
                              So in terms of numbers and in terms of quality,&#13;
&#13;
             I think there is very little question but they can meet these&#13;
&#13;
             goals.&#13;
&#13;
                              MR. McNAMARA:         Mr. Jalil,    with respect to Mr. Choi's&#13;

&#13;
                              MR.   JALIL:        As is stated in the President's report,&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
             educational strategy and plans that the government has for&#13;
&#13;
             the next few years, this proportion is likely to go up to abo t&#13;
&#13;
             25 percent in 1984.&#13;
&#13;
                              Now, what proportion of the government's expenditur&#13;
                   cvi:i;-LV~k&#13;
             is -a     decH~ant,     I don't know how to answer this question.&#13;
&#13;
             excepting it does reflect the government's priority that the&#13;
&#13;
             government attaches to education.                   It does reflect that&#13;

&#13;
                               Whereas, this is so, and financing of education \Â·ec\&gt;.\ .e..~,,\&#13;
&#13;
             expenditure has not been a problem in the past, and&#13;
&#13;
             assuming the fiscal situation developing as it is,                                        the serious&#13;
&#13;
              look the government is giving to restructuring its situation i&#13;
&#13;
             the light of the new public ownership, we do not believe that&#13;
&#13;
             there will be any less commitment on the part of the governme&#13;
&#13;
              towards financing this important sector.                                       But more than that,&#13;
&#13;
             more than          th~l~ocation                    of resources, the government is increas-&#13;

              ingly watchful of its expenditures and trying to get more&#13;
&#13;
              mileage, more efficiency out of what it spends.&#13;
&#13;
                                This is a part of a continuing dialogue between the&#13;
&#13;
              Bank and the government insofar as capital expenditures are&#13;

&#13;
                            MR. CHOI:     Mr. Chairman, on the question of supply&#13;
&#13;
               of qualified teachers, I have no doubt that the previous&#13;
&#13;
               projects would provide numbers.           But I was just wondering&#13;
&#13;
               whether they were trained in the way to do a new type of teac -&#13;
&#13;
               ing?   That is the crux of my question.&#13;
&#13;
                          And on the question of recurring expenditure, while&#13;
&#13;
               there are all these cost reducing methods and of course it ls&#13;
&#13;
               within the right of the Ethipian government, or any government&#13;
&#13;
               for that matter, to decide what amount of its national income&#13;
&#13;
               it should spend on education, I was wondering in educational&#13;
&#13;
               projects whether we should not project the recurring costs fo&#13;
&#13;
               the future, so that the governments which are undergoing this&#13;
&#13;
               expansion of education would know the implications.&#13;
&#13;
                         It is awfully easy to implement expansion in educa-&#13;
&#13;
               tion, but very much more difficult to maintain it.&#13;

&#13;
            Jalil, have we projected or has the government projected its&#13;
&#13;
            future recurring costs associated with thfu project?&#13;

&#13;
            which I had stated earlier.&#13;
&#13;
                      MR. McNAMARA:    I think this is directly related to&#13;
&#13;
            Mr. Choi's point.&#13;
                      He is quite correct in emphasizing the re cessity fo&#13;

&#13;
              with this project, includes in it a large element of costs&#13;

                          I imagine that one of the problems that Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
               is facing is a lack of enough capable personnel, you know, fo&#13;

               managing this project.&#13;

&#13;
                it is stated that the execution of the project is guaranteed&#13;
&#13;
               by the presence of an experienced                 eng~neer                manag1        er, and&#13;

&#13;
            and the uncertainty as to the direction in which the politica&#13;
&#13;
            structure will move.&#13;
&#13;
                      But the question with respect to the implementation&#13;
&#13;
            on Ethiopian projects, I think M1Â·. Husain has pointed out to&#13;
&#13;
            you that it is only in recent years that we have significantl&#13;
&#13;
            expanded our lending to Ethiopia.   The particular education&#13;
&#13;
            project Mr. Gavidia pointed to took 14 months to make effecti&#13;
&#13;
            it didn't become effective until a few months ago, August&#13;
&#13;
            1974 I think.&#13;
                      The reason for the long delay in making it effectiv&#13;
&#13;
            was exactly the political disorders we referred to which in-&#13;
&#13;
            valved students and agitation, and inability of the parliamen&#13;
&#13;
            to focus on ratification of loans which was required under&#13;
&#13;
            its laws at that time.   And therefore the BoruÂ·d passed the&#13;
&#13;
            project in June or July of 1973, but it was only 14 months&#13;
&#13;
            later, in August or September of 1974, as I say six or eight&#13;
&#13;
            months ago, that it became effective.&#13;
&#13;
                      Hence, the delay in disbursing.&#13;
&#13;
                      The question is should one proceed under those&#13;
&#13;
            circumstances or not?    I think that with hindsight, it was&#13;
&#13;
            wise thatwe went ahead, because that project has influenced&#13;
&#13;
            this one and both of them combined will begin to deal with&#13;
&amp;#12;        STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
&#13;
  arc 20           this absolutely fundamental problem in Ethiopia which is the&#13;
&#13;
                   lack of literacy and at a sufficiently high level to support&#13;
&#13;
                   even a modest economic advance.    And the lack of trained pers&#13;
&#13;
                   nel to direct the investment.&#13;
&#13;
                             And, of course, the lack of external funds, one of&#13;
&#13;
                   the reasons why we have expanded Bank group lending in Ethio&#13;
&#13;
                   in recent years is that Ethiopia is a country among those wi&#13;
&#13;
                   the lowest per capita receipts of external funds, even though&#13;
&#13;
                   it is one of those in greatest need.&#13;
&#13;
                             Are there others who wish to speak to this?&#13;
&#13;
                              If not, we will proceed with it, then, and turn to&#13;
