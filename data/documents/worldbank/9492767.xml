Introduction&#13;

&#13;
In Latin America, the issue of water and sanitation services in                (Sechura, Quispicanchi and Loreto) and six district level (Tuman,&#13;
small towns, is becoming increasingly relevant and is linked to                Laredo, Talavera, Fernando Lores, Nueva Cajamarca and&#13;

Nevertheless, services in small towns, which in spite of their                 the WSP, financed by the Canadian International Development&#13;

                                                                               towns in October 2003 and was concluded in October 2007.&#13;
The term small town denotes different sizes in different countries.&#13;
In Peru, small towns have between 2.001 to 30.000 inhabitants,                 This is a unique and innovative experience in Peru and comple-&#13;
in Bolivia it is around 5.000 inhabitants and in Colombia they can             ments the initiatives developed in other countries of Latin America,&#13;
be up to 70.000 inhabitants. But, notwithstanding these differen-              such as Paraguay, Colombia and Ecuador2, in which other&#13;
ces, it has been recognized that all these towns have an issue in              measures have been implemented to promote participation of&#13;

legal framework (generally there is no express recognition of this             The seeking of solutions to improve supply of water and&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
management models involving delegation have been developed                      In this context, one of the key aspects in promoting the&#13;
over the last fifty years, using different types of operators, such             creation of specialized operators was the adoption of clear&#13;
as the municipal company, users' cooperatives, municipality-user                rules for provision of services. These were established&#13;
associations who manage the services by virtue of a contract with               through municipal ordinances, due to the legal authority of&#13;
the local government.                                                           the municipalities to do so. For the new management model,&#13;
                                                                                accepted by the people to be implemented, it was necessary&#13;
In the pilot project experience in Peru, we shifted from a                      for the municipalities to approve four municipal ordinances,&#13;
municipality in which all the functions involving supply of water               thus defining a new local legal framework for provision of&#13;
and sanitation services were concentrated, with all its resultant               service with a specialized operator.&#13;
problems, to a municipality that promoted the presence of other&#13;
actors ­civil society and specialized operators­ sharing with                   It must be highlighted that in August, 2005 the Vice Ministry&#13;
them, in the form of a Public-Private-Social Alliance, the various              of Construction and Sanitation, approved the Supreme Decree&#13;
functions involved in the supply of services, with clearly defined              Nº 016-2005-VIVIENDA, modifying the bylaws of the General&#13;
tasks and objectives. With the municipality retaining ownership                 Law on Sanitation Services (SD 09-95-PRES), in which it intro-&#13;
of the infrastructure and the power to regulate local services                  duced a new Title to the Regulation with reference to rural&#13;
and also determine the conditions in which the specialized                      areas and small towns, facilitating the entry of specialized&#13;
operator can operate, the dilemma of privatization of services3                 operators, to support the municipalities in the supply of water&#13;
has been resolved. This is a highly sensitive issue for the people              and sanitation services. With this the STPP has contributed to&#13;
and grassroots social organizations.                                            provide the country's municipalities and the general public, a&#13;
                                                                                new management model for water and sanitation services,&#13;
It must be pointed out that the STPP is a pilot project                         bringing sustainability in terms of the service and investments.&#13;
from which we hope to learn lessons in order to replicate it on&#13;
a larger scale. The sector authorities, that is the Vice Ministry               The STPP is preparing a reference manual, which will contain&#13;
of Construction and Sanitation, can incorporate these lessons                   guidelines to support change in the management model by&#13;
in developing a strategy for intervention in small towns. It could              incorporating a social focus and an interactive CD with the&#13;
also be of help to Cooperation Agencies, interested in promoting                tools and instruments developed during the project.&#13;
sustainable investment. The STPP thus complements the&#13;
activities of the National Rural Sanitation Program (PRONASAR)&#13;
run by the Vice Ministry of Construction and Sanitation in 25&#13;
localities, which also seeks to establish a model of management&#13;
involving Specialized Operators4.&#13;

 1. Background&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the majority of the small towns in Peru5, it is the                            In response to this situation and within the framework of the&#13;
municipalities, which directly provide water and sanitation                       decentralization process initiated in the country in the year 2002,&#13;
services and make all decisions on the type of service and                        the Vice Ministry for Construction and Sanitation, with the&#13;
the charges for it. Of the 644 small towns in the country                         financial help of the Canadian International Development Agency&#13;
(with a population of between 2,001 to 30,000 inhabitants),                       (CIDA) and the technical assistance of the Water and Sanitation&#13;
in 154 the water and sanitation services are managed by                           Program (WSP-LAC) launched the Small Town Pilot Project&#13;
Water and Sanitation Companies (WSC) that are owned by                            (STPP), to develop new models of management of water and&#13;
the municipality and regulated by the SUNASS, while in the                        sanitation services.&#13;
rest of the small towns the services are mainly provided&#13;
directly by provincial or district level municipalities.                          The basic concept of the STPP is that the municipality and the&#13;
                                                                                  community should jointly decide to change the management&#13;
According to the results of a study carried out by the STPP6,                     model, after studying the advantages and disadvantages of&#13;
the services managed by the local government are marked                           the different options. That is to say this proposal was based on&#13;
by low coverage, tariff charges7 that do not allow recovery of                    the demands of the interested parties. Thus, municipalities that&#13;
costs, subsidies to the service within the budgetary limitations                  were interested in changing the way the services were managed,&#13;
of the municipalities, inefficient operation and maintenance,                     were invited to participate in the Project. Fifty-six municipalities&#13;
deficient management, political interference, high rotation                       responded to the invitation and eleven9 were selected on the basis&#13;
of service personnel, delay in payment of charges and                             of their geographical location, population size and inadequate&#13;
unwillingness on the part of the people to pay because of the                     quality and coverage of the service. The municipalities agreed in&#13;
poor quality of service, as well as the municipal authority's                     a session of the Municipal Council to develop a new management&#13;
unwillingness to charge for the service. The conclusion is                        model, undertaking to promote participative mechanisms for the&#13;
that the municipalities face serious limitations in terms of                      community to approve the proposal and take the decision to&#13;
efficient management of these services, unlike in the case                        change the management model.&#13;

The figures in the table 6 clearly demonstrate the relative impor-         to the higher areas, which made the cost of the service higher.&#13;

When we compare the income from the charges for the service                Direction (DIGESA), fecal coliform traces were found in 87% of&#13;

3. The new management model&#13;
        with a specialized operator&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The STPP was launched in October 2003, within the framework                        management model, a quick diagnosis and analysis of&#13;
of the Organic Law of Municipalities (May 2003), the Framework                     the supply and demand for new operators was made.&#13;
Law for Promotion of Decentralized Investment (August 2003)                        To deal with the lack of demand and supply and to help&#13;
and the Political Constitution of the State of 1993. To design                     develop the new management model, the STPP identified&#13;
the strategy for intervention and the elements of the new                          the following issues:&#13;
&#13;
                      Reason for lack of demand                                               Elements for designing the new model&#13;
&#13;
  Lack of knowledge on the benefits of a specialized operator and          Training of authorities and municipal officials on the advantages of having a SO in&#13;
  the mechanisms of participation of the private sector (PSP).             the Social-Private-Public Partnership.&#13;
&#13;
  Unwillingness to increase the charges to ensure full recovery of         Consultation with citizens to fix the quality and price of the services to be approved&#13;
  costs.                                                                   by the municipality.&#13;
&#13;
  Lack of political will to delegate a politically sensitive service to    Decision making to hire a SO is shared between the municipality and civil society&#13;
  third parties.                                                           (public and users).&#13;
&#13;
  The district municipalities' resistance to being subordinate to the      Contracts with the SO are signed by the district municipalities in the scope of the&#13;
  provincial municipalities.                                               new Organic Law of Municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
  Perception that the cost for promotion of private sector was             Offer of technical assistance, by international cooperation agencies, to municipali-&#13;
&#13;
  elevated.                                                                ties to change the management model and development of the capacities of local&#13;
                                                                           professionals in order to be SOs.&#13;
&#13;
                       Reasons for lack of offer                                              Elements for designing the new model&#13;
&#13;
  The political decision of the Government to promote the SO and PSP       The STPP is designed as an initiative of the Ministry of Housing, Construction and&#13;
  in small towns is not perceived.                                         Sanitation, supported by CIDA and implemented by WSP.&#13;
&#13;
  Signing a long term contract with a municipality is considered high risk Use of contract modalities with lesser duration (5 to 10 years) than concession and&#13;
  because of this is not a normal practice in Peru.                        strong participation from the community and/or users.&#13;
&#13;
  The municipal authorities were unwilling to increase the fees to ensure  Citizen consultations to determine the quality and price of the services, to be&#13;
  full recovery of costs.                                                  approved by the municipality by means of an ordinance.&#13;
  The absence of a culture of payment among the people would require&#13;
  heavy investments in sanitary education, which the municipality would    Include promotion of health and hygiene, which helps in valuation of the water&#13;
&#13;
  not want to incur.                                                       resource, led by the municipality and the local organizations.&#13;
&#13;
  The unwillingness of the people to pay more for improved quality         Sensitize and train the people on issues relating to the quality of service, its impact&#13;
  service.                                                                 on health and its relation with the price of the service by a promotion strategy.&#13;
&#13;
  SUNASS cannot regulate the charges and supervise the municipality-       Participation of civil society in determining quality-price and in supervising the con-&#13;
  operator contract.                                                       tract with the Specialized Operator.&#13;
  The municipalities would not be able to implement a PSP or PPP pro-&#13;
  cess without technical assistance at the regional or central govern-     Technical assistance to the STPP municipalities to help change the management&#13;
&#13;
  ment level.                                                              model. Two firms were hired to provide this service in two groups of towns11.&#13;
&#13;
  The municipalities did not have the financial resources to follow up&#13;
  on the investments for expansion and upgrade of services, which the      STPP allocates financial resources for an impact study on the quality of the service&#13;
&#13;
  operator can be asked to do.                                             and will help the municipality to get more resources.&#13;
&#13;
  The legal framework that regulated the provision of water and sewage     Technical assistance will be offered to the municipalities to develop a stable local&#13;
  services in the small towns had legal vacuum and cross interpretation    normative framework through ordinances that would be linked to the contracts,&#13;
  had to be done of the legal norms                                        which would enjoy constitutional protection as a law, between the two parties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11The firms hired were the Peruvian-Bolivian consortium CADUCEO-CAEM and the Austrian-American consortium TBW-INFRAMAN. The contract with the second&#13;
   consortium was concluded in advance by mutual agreement between the parties and its functions were taken over by the WSP consultant team.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Subsequently the new management model was outlined and was                had varied and dissimilar results owing to the impact of the eco-&#13;
defined as the new local institutional arrangement to perform the         nomic and political instability in the countries. In the 90s a new&#13;
main functions associated with the provision of services, which           institutional arrangement was developed, which was based on the&#13;
would have three key actors: the municipality, civil society and          lack of investment and private funding in the public services sector&#13;
specialized private, community, or mixed operators, with their            and the need to reduce social and political risks, manifested in&#13;
own specific roles.                                                       Private-Public Participation (PPP).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                          Thus various contractual modalities of Private-Public Participation&#13;

in the towns. To regulate the provision of services, the munici-&#13;
palities approved four ordinances: Ordinance on Provision of             There was more debate on the system of pricing and charges in&#13;
&#13;
Services, on the Community Neighborhood Supervision Board,               the Municipal Councils, given that the municipality had to work out&#13;
&#13;
on Attending Claims and on the System of Pricing and Charges.            a policy for cross-subsidies and this had to be done step-by-step.&#13;
                                                                         The main issues for debate on the pricing system were:&#13;
&#13;
i. Ordinance on Provision of Services. This ordinance regulates          · From when will the new charges be applied? (Immediately, when&#13;
the rights and duties of the specialized operator and the users            the specialized operator comes in or when the services improve)&#13;
of the service. This is based on the General Law on Sanitation           · Who, how and for how long will a user have right to discounted&#13;

iii. Ordinance on Attending to Claims. It establishes the pro-             protection, solidarity etc.)&#13;
cedures and time frames to attend to commercial and operational&#13;
claims, in first and second instance. Although it is clear that the&#13;
municipality has regulatory powers as a second instance, the first       4.1. The municipality and the promotion of operators&#13;

· Administrative boards of the rural water and sanitation services     there were no experiences of having specialized operators&#13;

From the time of the announcement till the receipt of proposals,       in the water and sanitation services sector, it was decided to&#13;
&#13;
an average of three meetings were held with potential bidders.         establish certain minimum criteria to start the process of&#13;

&#13;
First meeting. On the first three days after the announcement          · They must be familiar with the provision of public services.&#13;
was made. The purpose of the meeting was to make the public&#13;

with the participation of the Community Neighborhood&#13;
Supervision Board to provide social support to the process&#13;
and reduce the social perception of risk with regard to&#13;
the change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Second meeting. This was held three days before the&#13;
deadline for formulation of any queries. The purpose was to&#13;
explain the content of the tender documents. This was done&#13;
with the people who had purchased the bidding terms and condi-&#13;
tions as well as invitees (potential bidders), keeping in mind that&#13;
buying the terms and conditions does not necessarily suppose&#13;
that they have read them or understood them in their entirety.&#13;
The issues dealt with were: i) Explanation of the business&#13;
plan ii) Definition of the requisites to participate in the bid&#13;
iii) Explanation of the selection procedure iv) Explanation of&#13;
the contract and its annexes. The queries made by the partici-&#13;

criteria, it was concluded that the only factor of competence         charges that include the cost of improvement and expansion&#13;

would offer to contribute to the Investment Fund, as this is          only on operation and maintenance costs and infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
more transparent and easy to apply locally. It was also observed      replacement costs, and compared with the capacity levels and&#13;
&#13;
that the time frame for the bidders to prepare their proposals        willingness of the people to pay, makes the creation of an&#13;

resources, donations, transfers and by the new users.                   · In order to prioritize the following will be kept in mind:&#13;
                                                                          households with at least one child between 6 to 12 years,&#13;

to all human groups without exclusion. But it is the poorest that         member or no employed members.&#13;
have the most unstable conditions of access, which pay for the&#13;
most expensive services, as they are not covered by the supply          · Households whose basic needs aren't met:&#13;
&#13;
network. This leads to an inverse relation between price and              · Improvised housing in a place that is not meant for human&#13;

Thus in the pilot project, efficient management of services               · Homes without hygiene services.&#13;
and attention to the poorest was a special challenge for the              · Households without any comfort index (they do not have:&#13;
municipality, the specialized operator and the JVS, as it                   electricity, television, radio, furniture, gas stove, motorcycles,&#13;
proposed a new way of approaching the issue by jointly                      cell phones, nor have they got any credits).&#13;
deciding on the criteria, ensuring the sustainability of the&#13;
operating entity and at the same time guaranteeing the human&#13;
right to drinking water for the poorest of families. This was to&#13;
ensure identification of the "poor user" by taking into&#13;
consideration economic and social variables. The definition&#13;
makes a comparison between the actual living conditions of the&#13;
people and those conditions that place them above or below&#13;
the poverty line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In this framework, the criteria to identify the poorest of families&#13;
would be as follows:&#13;
&#13;
· Single-parent household or homes where one of the parents is&#13;
  unable to work.&#13;
&#13;
· Households whose total expense is below the value of a basic&#13;
  food basket or an extreme poverty line. Based on socio-&#13;
  economical studies done in the towns in the extreme poverty&#13;
  group, the per capita cost or the monthly expense per person&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      30&#13;

On the other hand the proposal also identified those termed as           from the municipality, directly subsidizing the poor.&#13;
"social cases" which included users in a situation of vulnerability&#13;
(destruction due to fire or earthquakes). Although these cases do        The municipality (1), the JVS (2) and the specialized operator (1)&#13;
not necessarily fulfill the abovementioned criteria, they may still      will set up an evaluation committee, who will receive applications&#13;
be levied a "social charge for water" in view of their situation, for    for social charges for water. The evaluation committee will study&#13;
a given period of time. Orphanages, free dining halls, `glass of         the applications and will decide on the eligibility, based on the cri-&#13;

their inability to pay are also eligible. In the STPP these criteria&#13;
were validated in the JVS meetings, in the presence of officials         Once the municipality receives the recommendations of the&#13;

5. Characteristics of the contracts of the new&#13;
      specialized operator&#13;

6. The creation of a market&#13;
       for specialized operators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As known, a market is the place where offer meets demand                            Given this scenario, the urban towns that did not come&#13;
and a transaction is produced. A market does not exist when                         under a municipal EPS (more than 75% of the small towns)&#13;
there is no offer or demand, or if the transaction is not executed                  and which did not incorporate an EPS, had an informal&#13;
due to its high cost. When the Small Town Pilot Project ­STPP                       provision of water and sanitation services. The cost of this&#13;
proposed a change in the municipal management model of the                          informality was that the majority of them did not have access&#13;
water and sanitation services, to one where the management                          to the resources of FONAVI22 to expand its services and that the&#13;
would be delegated to third parties, one issue had to be dealt                      charges were maintained at levels way below recovery of costs.&#13;
with­ there was no demand for this service in the municipalities                    With respect to the legislation, which promoted participation of&#13;
and there was no offer from the private sector. This absence of                     the private sector, in the Supreme Decree No. 059-96-PCM that&#13;
demand and offer, that is to say the non-existence of a market,                     approved the "Single Revised Text of the Norms with the status&#13;
presented the challenge of inducing and promoting the creation                      of a law that regulates the concession to the private sector of&#13;
of the said market.                                                                 public infrastructure works and public services"; indicated for&#13;

For this an analysis was made of the lack of demand and offer                       the concession of its public services; but prior to this the Law&#13;
and the guidelines for new models of management of water and                        26338 had established that the provincial municipality was&#13;
sanitation services were established, wherein the risks perceived                   entitled to the right to exploitation, therefore a district municipality&#13;
by local governments and local investors were addressed. This                       would have to coordinate with the provincial authority, if it&#13;
process was described in the previous points.                                       decided to give the public services of its town in franchise.&#13;

&#13;
responsibility of supplier entities (in a broad sense), which may                   district level, and in this year itself the Framework Law for&#13;
&#13;
be public, private or mixed entities20. In turn, the Supreme                        Promotion of Decentralized Investment (Law 28059) was&#13;

  is one wherein the State has the power to decide; if its share is minority then&#13;
  it is not considered a mixed company but a private company with State par-&#13;

  after the first year of operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· In Laredo, the operating company has been established as a&#13;
  share capital company, where the municipality has a 49% of&#13;
  the shares and neighborhood associations have a 51% share.&#13;
  Since there is no strategic partner linked to the provision of&#13;
  services, in Laredo, the capital of the operating company is&#13;
  considerably greater than in the other two cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    40&#13;

7. Difficulties in the STPP&#13;
      pilot project processes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There were various types of difficulties that were faced in              the opposition groups resulted in the postponement, on three&#13;
the implementation of the STPP with regard to the member                 occasions, of the selection process of the Specialized Operator in&#13;
municipalities in the project and also the intervention process          Laredo.&#13;
with the two technical assistance firms. The problems can be&#13;
summarized in the following groups: pertaining to the supply of          However, political interference could not be overcome in two&#13;
operators, political and social in nature, communication related         towns, which led to them withdrawing. Santiago in the Ica&#13;
and regarding expectations in terms of infrastructure and transfer       region and Ayabaca in the Piura region withdrew after 8 months&#13;
of services.                                                             of intervention. In these towns the political opposition groups&#13;
                                                                         mobilized some grass-root organizations creating an environment&#13;
&#13;
7.1. Lack of a specialized operator market                               of social hostility more against the mayor than against the&#13;
                                                                         Project as such. But the final decision was the withdrawal&#13;
&#13;
One of the main problems was the pioneering nature of the                of the municipalities from the Project. On the other hand the&#13;
&#13;
creation of a market of specialized operators with local and or          municipalities of San Jerónimo and Saylla withdrew because they&#13;
&#13;
regional characteristics. The absence of local operating companies       had an undertaking with an NGO, for more financial support for&#13;
&#13;
or professionals interested in entering the operator market was          other activities in their town.&#13;
&#13;
one of the initial limitations of the project. This situation became&#13;
more complicated when in some towns the change in model was              However the most difficult test in this process occurred during&#13;
&#13;
accepted but at the same time it was demanded that the operator          the process of national and regional elections held in 2006 and&#13;
&#13;
hired should be local or regional. This limitation was overcome          subsequently the taking over of the new municipal management.&#13;
&#13;
by an induction strategy, according to the conditions of each            Thus those who had actually implemented the process for&#13;
&#13;
town, with actions for promotion by the municipality and a direct        selection and hiring of specialized operators moved from office.&#13;
&#13;
communication strategy with the parties interested in becoming&#13;
operators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.2. Political and social problems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
These were the most challenging problems, especially in the first&#13;
year, given that in the majority of the people there was a strong&#13;
sentiment of rejection of "privatization". Political opposition groups&#13;
in the 11 initial small towns took advantage of this situation to&#13;
challenge the mayors and the municipal councils. The project&#13;
developed a special strategy for communication and promotion&#13;
to explain to the users the differences between "privatization"&#13;
and the hiring of a specialized operator to make the services&#13;
more professional, guaranteeing that the ownership of the assets&#13;
would be maintained with the local government. The activity of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This change in authority in the beginning of 2007 directly affected   · Less information was given to the public to avoid public&#13;
the processes in the towns of Urcos (Cusco), Nueva Cajamarca             fatigue, loss of credibility, owing to delays in the beginning&#13;
(San Martin) and in Tuman (Lambayeque). In these three cases,            of the impact work.&#13;
the new municipal authorities were not aware of the process           · The importance of communication in the bidding process&#13;
had resulted in the signing of the contracts with the operating          was underestimated, assuming that it was unnecessary to&#13;
companies. In the case of Urcos the STPP ended its intervention          communicate this phase to the public, given its complexity.&#13;
because of a decision by the new mayor and in the other two&#13;
cases a phase of re-negotiation has been started with these           · Adequate information flow was not strengthened and neither&#13;
&#13;
authorities in order to maintain the agreements and local legal          was the confidence of the municipality and civil society in the&#13;
&#13;
stability, along with social peace, although it has been with            potential operators strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
mixed results.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      7.4. Problems with expectations in terms&#13;
7.3. Problems in terms of Communications                                     of infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There were initial difficulties in conveying the messages on the      Normally water and sanitation projects tend to be associated&#13;
&#13;
new management model, given the complex elements and                  with infrastructure works. This is a very deep-rooted perception&#13;
&#13;
conceptual content of the management model and the various            at various levels of society and public administration. Thus it&#13;
&#13;
options for change in the promotion and communication strategy        was difficult in the beginning of the project to communicate&#13;
&#13;
for operators. There were also other difficulties faced, which led    the conceptual message of the proposal, emphasizing that&#13;
&#13;
to the initial bid notifications in Tamshiyacu and Tabalosos being    the objective of the project was to improve management,&#13;
&#13;
declared as deserted, in the first quarter of 2005. This weakness     administration or in the best of cases contribute to professionalism&#13;
&#13;
in communication was because:                                         in the operation, maintenance and replacement of services. And&#13;
                                                                      that only after this would it be helped with the implementation of&#13;
                                                                      an "impact study" to improve services. However this in no way&#13;
                                                                      meant an immediate solution to the crisis faced by the service. To&#13;
                                                                      overcome this expectation in terms of infrastructure, an intense&#13;

   public and/or users of the service. Prior to starting the process,      issues relating to the hiring of an operator, the 9 municipalities&#13;
   during it and in the subsequent stages, there should be a               laid down four ordinances to clarify the rules of the process:&#13;

&#13;
     the phase of promotion and empowerment, as well as greater            Given that the ordinance on the provision of services and the&#13;
     interest, expectations and commitment on the part of the              ordinance on attention to claims refer to the rights and duties of&#13;
     social actors involved in taking the project forward.                 the users and the service providers, the governing body should&#13;

   require a minimum market scale. It will be the social, economic          commercial risk and the risk of working capital investments.&#13;
&#13;
   and technical characteristics of each town that will determine           It is difficult for the moment for them to take on the risk of&#13;
&#13;
   the type of specialized operator who will provide the service of         investments owing to the absence of suitable long term credits&#13;
&#13;
   this essential commodity.                                                in the national financial market and the impact on the returns&#13;
                                                                            on their investments.&#13;
6. With due training on issues of quality of service and its&#13;
   associated costs, people can take appropriate decisions in           12. The capacity for payment of the people in small towns is such&#13;
&#13;
   their own interest, which may involve an increase in charges till        that they cannot be burdened with charges for extension of&#13;
&#13;
   arriving at a charge that allows full recovery of costs associated       coverage of services. Hence this must be the responsibility of&#13;
&#13;
   with the quality objectives of the service.                              the municipalities with the help of transfers from the central&#13;
                                                                            and regional government.&#13;
7. In small towns the poorest section can be taken care of&#13;
   by levying charges that are in keeping with their economic           13. The creation of a market for specialized operators in the&#13;
&#13;
   capacity. This can be done by hiring specialized operators               small towns of Peru, has tremendous potential today if&#13;
&#13;
   who are suited to the scale of operations, who do not disturb            the Central Government give technical assistance to the&#13;
&#13;
   the local labor market and on the basis of a consistent socio-           municipalities to conduct the processes, the local governments&#13;
&#13;
   economic study.                                                          have appropriate information and know the advantages of&#13;
                                                                            hiring specialized operators, the Central Government offers&#13;
8. To have a successful selection process for specialized                   incentives for extension of coverage, with the participation&#13;
   operators the terms and conditions of the tender and the                 of specialized operators and the users have access to&#13;
   management contract must be designed to make sense in                    information and are invited to take part in participative&#13;
   the local context, without creating insurmountable barriers for          processes to take decisions on quality-price for the service&#13;
   access in terms of the profile of the operator.                          and also commit to support the sustainability of their services.&#13;
&#13;
9. It is important to promote, among the bidders, the presence&#13;
   of at least one person who has been associated with the&#13;
   supply of water and sanitation services in an EPS, JASS or&#13;
   municipality. This helps the bidder evaluate the risks in the&#13;
   operation with greater awareness of the reasons, especially in&#13;
   order to overcome the fear of non-payment.&#13;

            The new operators in Peruvian small towns :
            designing a sustainable management model for water and
            sanitation services
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In most of the small localities of Peru,
            the municipalities offer direct water and sanitation
            services, and make decisions based on the service format and
            quotas. In regard to localities, the pilot project to
            improve water and sanitation for small towns (PPPL) has been
            instituted. This paper has the following headings:
            introduction; background; service in small towns; a new
            management model with specialized providers; a new role for
            the municipality, ordinances, and special providers;
            characteristics of the contracting for special providers;
            the creation of a market for special providers; and the
            difficulties encountered in the pilot project.
