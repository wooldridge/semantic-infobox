This report is based on the findings of Bank appraisal and post-appraisal missions in July 1993 and July 1994,&#13;
respectively. The mission members included: Mr. Gautam Sengupta (Task Manager), Mr. Christopher Hoban&#13;
(Highway Engineer), Mr. Alan Armstrong-Wright (Consultant Transport Economist), Mr. Mike Riley (Consultant&#13;
Maintenance Management Specialist), Mrs. Rowena Martinez (Operations Analyst), and Mr. Muthoka Mutungi&#13;
(Information Technology Specialist). Peer reviewer for the project was Mr. John Flora. Mr. William Matthey&#13;
(Consultant Transportation Engineer) assisted in the preparation of the documents. Secretarial support and report&#13;
production was done by Mrs. Victoria Fofanah. Mr. Stephen J. Weissman and Mr. James W. Adams are the Managing&#13;
Division Chief and Department Director, respectively, for the operation.&#13;
Following the post-appraisal mission in July 1994, a Kenyan delegation led by Mr. Richard arap Siele (Permanent&#13;
Secretary, Ministry of Local government (MLG)), and accompanied by Mr. K. Ruchiami (Deputy Secretary,&#13;
Development and Finance, MLG), Mr. L. Ngare (Project Manager, TMU), Mr. N. Nyariki (Project Engineer, TMU),&#13;
Mr. S. Kamau (Project Engineer, TMU) and Mr. S. Laban (Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Finance), visited the Bank&#13;
headquarters in October 1994 to jointly work with the Bank staff in preparing relevant sections of this appraisal report&#13;
and other project related documents. This appraisal report reflects the common position of both the Bank staff and the&#13;
Kenyan counterpart officials associated with the project.&#13;

I.  BACKGROUND&#13;
A.    Macroeconomic Setting&#13;
1.01    The Kenyan economy began to deteriorate in 1991, after a period of relatively high growth&#13;
(averaging 5.0% p.a.) from 1985 through 1990. Growth of GDP (at factor cost) was 4.2 % in 1990, 2.1%&#13;
in 1991, 0.5 % in 1992, and is estimated to have declined further to about 0.2% in 1993. The downward&#13;
trend is attributable to both extemal and domestic factors. External factors included the worldwide&#13;
recession, the Gulf War and three successive years of poor rainfall. Domestic economic factors, causing a&#13;
marked fall in fixed capital formation and capital investment efficiency after 1989, also contributed&#13;
towards the very low GDP growth during 1991 through 1993. During this period, there was a sharp&#13;
decline in public investment in essential infrastructure (down from 9.8% of central government&#13;
expenditures in FY81-FY85 to 5.7% in FY91-FY92, with an even greater decline in road investments).&#13;
Poor economic management also lead to freezing of donor balance of payments support late in 1991. In&#13;
1992 and early 1993, a major expansion of the money supply had a significant inflationary impact on the&#13;
economy.&#13;
1.02    Under a program monitored by the IMF and IDA, the Government of Kenya (GOK) took action&#13;
between April and October 1993 to reassert financial sector discipline, tighten monetary policy and&#13;
eliminate import controls. These measures strengthened donor confidence in Kenya's reform efforts. To&#13;
arrest and reverse the economic decline, GOK launched an economic recovery program in late 1993,&#13;
embodied in a new Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for 1994-96. This program was supported by a one-&#13;
year (October 1993 - September 1994) enhanced structural adjustment facility program (ESAF). The&#13;
ESAF arrangement coincided with the resumption of bilateral and multilateral support for Kenya in 1993&#13;
and marked a turnaround of confidence in the country's economic reform efforts by the international&#13;
community. While the ESAF covered only a one-year period, it was cast in the context of a medium-term&#13;
strategy aimed at restoring and sustaining economic growth. The GOK's strategy sought (i) macro-&#13;
economic stabilization through tough fiscal and monetary policies; (ii) substantial reduction in the role of&#13;
the public sector; (iii) strengthened the financial system; (iv) promotion of exports and elimination of anti-&#13;
export biases; (v) domestic deregulation, including decontrol of prices and liberalization of the agricultural&#13;
sector; and (vi) improvement of the private investment environment. Specific focus was put on reducing&#13;
inflation quickly and strengthening the balance of payments position during this first phase of the reform&#13;
program.&#13;
B.    Recent Economic Developments&#13;
1.03    Major progress was achieved in restoring macro-economic stability during the period October&#13;
1993 - September 1994. Inflation declined from 54.7% at end 1993 to an estimated 6.6% at end 1994.&#13;
The balance of payments was considerably stronger than expected. Progress was also achieved in the&#13;
GOK's civil service reform efforts, strengthening of the financial system, and substantial liberalization of&#13;
the economy across all sectors. However, efforts towards parastatal reforms fell below expectations.&#13;
Economic growth remained stagnant during the first half of 1994, mainly reflecting prolonged drought&#13;
conditions and high domestic interest rates. Recent years have seen an improvement; the fiscal deficit&#13;
(excluding grants) declined from 8% of GDP in FY94 to 2.5% in FY95. Real growth accelerated to 3% in&#13;
1994 and is projected to be 5% in 1995.&#13;
1.04    Continued progress on the full range of economic reform measures and sustaining the new policy&#13;
initiatives are critical to Kenya's future growth and stability. With population growing at 3.0% p.a. and the&#13;
labor force growing at 4.1% p.a., Kenya needs growth rates of at least 7% - 8% p.a. to keep its already&#13;
high unemployment rate (23% urban) from rising further. Achieving these growth rates will require not&#13;
only steady adherence to the defined reform program, but also increased investments in key constraining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
areas, such as rural and urban infrastructure. In addition to make those investments efficient, the role of&#13;
the government at all levels will need to be reoriented towards creating a more enabling environment for&#13;
enhancing economic activities and growth.&#13;
C.    Urban Sector Overview&#13;
1.05   While the 1989 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey indicates that population growth rates may&#13;
have peaked and entered a period of decline, Kenya still has a high natural population growth rate and one&#13;
of the highest rates of urbanization in the world. In the decade 1979-89, the urban population grew by over&#13;
5.1% p.a., compared to the total population growth of 2.7% p.a. The growth rate of Nairobi, Kenya's&#13;
largest city (1.4 million in 1989), was 5.0% p.a., and was exceeded only by Nakuru (at 5.8% p.a.), one of&#13;
the country's five largest urban centers. Smaller towns on average grew considerably faster. Nairobi was&#13;
home to nearly 45% of the urban population in 1989, up slightly from 1979. Based on recent trends, the&#13;
urban share of the total population will rise from 19% in 1989 to 21% in 2000. It is expected that during&#13;
the next decade over half of the urban population increase will come from rural-urban migration.&#13;
1.06   Urban areas in Kenya function as trading centers for agriculture and their economic importance&#13;
goes beyond being centers of population and industry. Financial services are concentrated there, as are the&#13;
centers of trade, transport and communication services, manufacturing, construction, and government.&#13;
About 21% of formal employment, and 65% of informal sector employment is in the urban areas. Nairobi&#13;
alone accounts for 28% of wage employment in the country. Kenya's development challenge remains one&#13;
of employment creation and poverty reduction. Between now and the year 2000 nearly 500,000 people will&#13;
enter the labor force each year (reflecting a projected labor force growth rate of about 4% per year - over&#13;
6% per year in the urban areas). Most of the employment seekers will be in the urban areas. Over 30% of&#13;
Kenya's urban population today is below the poverty line; the proportion being higher in the larger towns&#13;
such as Nairobi and Mombasa. To support the needed economic growth to reduce unemployment and&#13;
increase  incomes will require both structural reforms and investments in basic infrastructure.&#13;
Administrative, financial and technical capacity of the local authorities who have the mandate to provide&#13;
and maintain these basic infrastructure will also need to be strengthened for sustainability of these&#13;
investments.&#13;
1.07   The high rate of urban growth continues to put tremendous strain on basic social infrastructure,&#13;
local authority finances and administrative capacity.  The government recognizes that improved&#13;
infrastructure is critical to attract and disperse private domestic and foreign investment to support Kenya's&#13;
economic growth. However, weak local administrative, financial and operational capacity are adversely&#13;
affecting the quality of service and maintenance of all basic municipal infrastructure. Some segments of&#13;
the economy, particularly the industrial sector and the higher income population, have found alternate ways&#13;
to compensate for the decline in service standards through such means as private water wells, private&#13;
generators for electricity, etc. However, the urban poor, who must rely on the government for the provision&#13;
of basic municipal services, are being particularly hard hit by this decline in service delivery standards,&#13;
with no alternative means to access such services.&#13;
1.08   GOK is aware of this problem and is currently undertaking a broad based and long term program&#13;
of local government reforms. The government's rural-urban balance strategy provides a blue print for&#13;
simultaneously stimulating growth of urban centers and their agricultural hinterland that is consistent with&#13;
the country's macro-economic objectives. However, given the rate of population growth, the government&#13;
clearly recognizes that efforts must be intensified to meet the objectives of this policy. Accordingly, the&#13;
government is undertaking a major initiative to strengthen local authorities by up-grading management&#13;
capabilities, consolidating and enhancing revenue base and rationalizing expenditures of the local&#13;
authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D.    Institutional Framework&#13;
1.09    Kenya has 140 local authorities, ranging from major municipal councils, including Nairobi City&#13;
Council (NCC), town councils (which differ mainly in size rather than status), county councils and urban&#13;
councils (the latter partly subordinate to the former). All are corporate bodies with their own assets, staff,&#13;
budgets, etc., constituted under the 1963 Local Government Act (Cap 265). Their numbers have grown&#13;
rapidly since independence, particularly in the 1980s, reflecting a policy of dispersed urbanization&#13;
enunciated in 1986. This expansion has exacerbated the shortage of qualified personnel (especially in&#13;
financial management and engineering) in local authorities and in Ministry of Local Government. Many&#13;
local authorities today have financial bases which are grossly inadequate for adequately maintaining the&#13;
assets and covering their administrative overheads.&#13;
1.10    Urban local authorities (not county councils) have relatively wide responsibilities.  All are&#13;
responsible for land use planning and development control; all maintain roads and are responsible for street&#13;
lighting and cleaning, refuse collection, fire protection, environmental health, markets, bus parks, slaughter&#13;
houses, parks and recreation. Nearly all provide public rental housing, and other low-cost housing&#13;
schemes. Seven municipal councils Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kitale and Thika are&#13;
also education and health authorities. Several local authorities also operate water supply and/or sewerage&#13;
systems. County councils, responsible for rural local authorities, by contrast, have few responsibilities and&#13;
vary widely in their roles and revenue bases. Larger local authorities operate many services with their own&#13;
staff and equipment, while the staff and operating resources of the smaller ones are supplemented by&#13;
central government equipment and/or technical supervision.&#13;
1.11    MLG has overall jurisdiction over the functioning of all the local authorities in Kenya. Local&#13;
authorities are required to operate as autonomous institutions under the Local Government Act. They are&#13;
expected to make by-laws, prepare budgets, procure goods and services, provide infrastructure services and&#13;
manage local resources. The MLG, under certain circumstances, is required by law to make direct&#13;
decisions on local authority activities when there are deviations from the established rules. For instance, if&#13;
a local authority wishes to award a tender to any other bidder other than the lowest, the council is required&#13;
to seek a ministerial approval. Local authority budgets are also approved by the MLG to ascertain that&#13;
councils operate with a balanced budget. This and other approvals are, however, often seen by many local&#13;
authorities as a way of restricting the councils' rights from operating as autonomous institutions. Local&#13;
authorities are also responsible for personnel management but are assisted by the government through the&#13;
Public Service Commission in the recruitment of senior personnel.  This recruitment process was&#13;
transferred to the government to harmonize recruitment procedures and to make sure that the right caliber&#13;
of personnel are appointed for senior management jobs. All these procedures were thought to be the best at&#13;
the time, however, they are not without problems. There is a growing recognition at all levels of&#13;
government that the current local authority system in Kenya is in need of considerable overhaul in keeping&#13;
economic and social needs and constraints.&#13;
E.    Municipal Finances&#13;
1.12    Local authorities in Kenya were financially sound in the 1960's and early 1970's when they used&#13;
to collect a Graduated Personal Tax (GPT) and there was little demand for basic urban services.&#13;
Population in urban centers was low and councils needed little manpower resources to implement basic&#13;
infrastructure programs. During the mid-1970's, the government decided that some services could be&#13;
potentially provided by the central government more efficiently and consequently these services (e.g., water&#13;
supply) were transferred from the local authorities to the central agencies. Between 1969 and 1973 the&#13;
government also gradually abolished the GPT. In the 1980's, there was rapid urbanization exerting&#13;
pressure on the existing urban services. The local authorities were unable to expand or maintain existing&#13;
urban services due to lack of adequate financial, manpower and administrative capacity. This resulted in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
declining local revenue generation causing a draw down of the reserves which were accumulated in the&#13;
1960's, increasing deficits in the General Rate Fund Revenue Accounts, and mounting arrears in payments&#13;
by the local authorities to the other parts of the public sector. In recognition to the dire financial situation,&#13;
the government in 1987 introduced a produce cess for Rural County Councils and in 1989 a Services&#13;
Charge was put in place. Despite these new taxes, the increased revenues have not improved the financial&#13;
position of the local authorities sufficiently to allow them to effectively deliver and maintain basic services.&#13;
The situation is further compounded by the heavy backlog of provision of services to meet the increasing&#13;
demands of a growing population base.&#13;
F.    Municipal Reform Program&#13;
1.13   In recent years, the local authority system (its finances and operations) in Kenya has deteriorated to&#13;
such an extent that fundamental structural changes are necessary to provide the necessary environment for&#13;
sustainable municipal infrastructure development. Such reforms must underlie any municipal investment,&#13;
such as proposed under the project. In recognition of this pre-requisite, in 1990, the Bank, in collaboration&#13;
with the government, undertook a comprehensive review of Kenya's local government system, particularly&#13;
its finances. The findings of this review are contained in the report "Kenya: Local Government Finance&#13;
Study", (Report No. 8997-KE, April 23, 1992). The primary objective of this study was to identify a&#13;
reform program necessary to bring the local authorities of Kenya out of their current financial and&#13;
operational distress so that, over time, they would be better able to plan, finance, deliver and maintain basic&#13;
urban services, such as road infrastructure. Based on the findings and recommendations of this study, the&#13;
government is pursuing a program of local government reform as part of its broader efforts towards&#13;
decentralization, public sector reform and privatization. A major initiative is now underway (financed&#13;
under a Japanese PHRD Grant Fund) to define and implement a Municipal Reform Program (MRP) to&#13;
strengthen local authorities by improving their finances, strengthening their management capabilities and&#13;
enhancing their technical capabilities for better infrastructure maintenance. The key elements of this&#13;
initiative include: reforming the current Local Government Act with a view of harmonizing the operations&#13;
of local authorities; improving local resource mobilization; reforming of the present Local Government&#13;
Loans Authority (LGLA); improving financial, technical and personnel management practices; and&#13;
improving local authority accounting and budgetary systems. The ultimate objective of the MRP would be&#13;
to build adequate capacity and to create financing mechanisms whereby local authorities would be in a&#13;
position to finance their local infrastructure needs without continuing dependence on the central&#13;
government. The MRP was launched by the government in 1993, with the establishment of a Task Force&#13;
charged with defining a detailed work program. The Task Force is comprised of specific teams and sub-&#13;
committees (consisting of officers from relevant GOK ministries and local authority officials) for&#13;
undertaking specific elements of the overall MRP. The Japanese PHRD Grant Fund, noted above, began to&#13;
support the actual implementation of this action program from about mid-1994 through financing of&#13;
specialized technical assistance inputs. With these inputs, key elements of the reform program are&#13;
currently being developed and they will be fully defined and designed during FY96/97. In the meantime,&#13;
some of the high priority actions -- improving accounting, budgeting, resource mobilization and expenditure&#13;
management practices -- are currently being implemented with a Japanese PHRD grant assistance under a&#13;
pilot program in a selected number of local authorities. These initiatives are already beginning to yield&#13;
positive results by way of realistic budgeting practices, improved revenue yields and better expenditure&#13;
management in a number of local authorities. Subject to the government's adoption of the full range of&#13;
policy, institutional and financial reforms for the sector as a whole, processing of an IDA financed&#13;
Municipal Reform Project to support this process could proceed during FY98.&#13;
1.14    GOK has submitted a Letter of Sectoral Policy, attached at ANNEX 1, describing its municipal&#13;
reform agenda and the relevance of the proposed project to the MRP. There are six broad areas of&#13;
municipal reform which are considered necessary in order for any municipal infrastructure investment,&#13;
including those under the proposed project, to be sustainable. Improvements and changes have either been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
already formulated or are in the process of being implemented in a pilot mode in a selected number of local&#13;
authorities. While all of the areas noted below of equally important, they are not of equal urgency.&#13;
Improvements are being introduced, in a phased manner, in the overall local authority system in the&#13;
following specific areas, in order of their implementation priority:&#13;
*      recurrent revenue generation and expenditure management&#13;
*      operations and maintenance capacity&#13;
*      financial management, accounting and budgeting systems&#13;
*      staff training and skills development&#13;
*      intergovernmental fiscal arrangements&#13;
*      financing mechanisms for municipal infrastructure&#13;
1.15   The MRP would address critical financial and operational bottlenecks, such as declining local&#13;
revenue generation, mutual indebtedness of local authorities and the government (including its Parastatal&#13;
enterprises), and the lack of a sustainable local authority investment financing mechanism. It would also&#13;
address issues of local authority budgeting, expenditure, accounting and audit systems; personnel&#13;
development and management; land administration and future role and structure of the MLG in relation to&#13;
the local authorities. Many of the objects of the reform program are difficult and their solution is expected&#13;
to require considerable time (extending beyond the implementation of the proposed project). It will require&#13;
a sustained effort by the government, as articulated in the Letter of Sectoral Policy. Success of efforts&#13;
under the MRP will determine the development impact and sustainability of all investments in the urban&#13;
sector.&#13;
G.    Bank Group's Country and Sector Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.16   Country Assistance Strategy: Kenya's main development challenge remains poverty reduction&#13;
through accelerated economic growth and employment creation. Kenya's strategy to reduce poverty seeks&#13;
to combine policies that encourage sustainable labor intensive growth with public expenditure programs&#13;
that will increasingly focus on the provision of basic social service, with particular emphasis on reaching&#13;
the poor. The GOK's Development Plan for 1994-96 and the Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1994 underscore the&#13;
theme of Sustainable Development. The Bank Group shares this vision and this is also the focus of its&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy for Kenya, which is being distributed separately for discussion by the Board.&#13;
The strategy has four major objectives: (a) encourage the government to provide and sustain a stable&#13;
macro economic environment, (b) support changes in the incentive framework and improve infrastructure&#13;
to promote accelerated and efficient economic growth based on export-oriented private sector investments;&#13;
(c) significantly increase the efficiency of the public sector, including parastatals; and, (d) address longer-&#13;
term human resource development issues and arrest the deterioration of Kenya's fragile environment.&#13;
1.17   Urban Sector Reform: Reforming Kenya's local authority system is a necessary ingredient for&#13;
achieving the above strategy, given the economic importance of the cities and towns as centers of&#13;
agricultural trade, transport and communication services, manufacturing, construction and government,&#13;
including national and local government services. The draft Letter of Sectoral Policy recognizes that&#13;
fundamental structural and systemic changes are necessary in the current local authority system for&#13;
financing and operating the public services required for continued economic growth and for their&#13;
sustainability. Many local authorities have consistently been running deficits and are heavily in debt that&#13;
they are unable to repay. Access to capital is increasingly limited, investments in maintenance of&#13;
infrastructure are inadequate, and many services are provided at substandard quality levels. As local&#13;
authorities are part of an integrated system of national and local institutions that should be working&#13;
together in pursuit of common objectives, the inability of councils to meet their share of development&#13;
responsibilities undernines efforts towards national economic growth. In particular, the heavy dependence&#13;
of local authorities on the national government to finance infrastructure investment is not sustainable, given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the present state of the economy and concurrent pressure for central fiscal reform. As the national fiscal&#13;
constraints that prevent the central ministries from dealing with the growing infrastructure shortfall become&#13;
increasingly binding, the ability of local authorities to manage capital investments and service operations&#13;
more responsibly becomes increasingly critical for the continued success of the Kenyan economy. The&#13;
proposed project would constitute a first step to support the government's plan to carry out the needed&#13;
reforms through the MRP (para. 1.13).&#13;
1.18    Road Sector Development:  One of the key infrastructures which is in urgent need of&#13;
improvement is Kenya's road network. It is evident that an efficient road transport system is essential for&#13;
promoting private sector development, particularly the export-oriented industries which are concentrated&#13;
around the urban centers. It is also a key infrastructure which directly affects the poor in their daily living&#13;
and wage earning efforts. The Bank Group's assistance to Kenya's road sector started before its&#13;
independence. Since 1960, the Bank Group has financed 12 road projects, including two sector projects.&#13;
These operations have focused largely on extending the major highway network and on constructing and&#13;
improving the rural road system. The Bank Group has not so far been involved in any project specifically&#13;
targeted at the urban road network.&#13;
1.19   Inadequate maintenance over many years and gradual erosion of public sector capacity to&#13;
effectively plan, finance and manage basic road infrastructure has significantly reduced the quality of&#13;
services in a number of subsectors. Various infrastructure systems, such as water and sewerage, solid&#13;
waste management, housing, hospitals, schools and recreational areas, etc., have deteriorated. However,&#13;
the extent of the problem is most visible in the road transport network where immediate and substantial&#13;
rehabilitation is required to maintain and enhance the economic efficiency of the system. Maintenance of&#13;
the urban road network is a key local authority function and the financial cost of adequately discharging&#13;
this responsibility by the local authorities is considerable. Routine and periodic road maintenance account&#13;
for over 60% of a local authority's recurrent budget.&#13;
1.20   Economic and financial costs of delaying effective intervention would be considerable. Although&#13;
the central government continues to bear most of the financial burden for maintaining the urban road&#13;
network, this should be primarily the responsibility of the local authorities. Consequently, a concurrent set&#13;
of municipal reforms aimed at improving financial and operational performance of the local authorities is&#13;
essential in order to provide a sustainable environment and the necessary revenue base such that the local&#13;
authorities can assume increasing road maintenance responsibility over time. While several broad urban&#13;
transport issues (such as more effective demand management, public transport policy reforms and strategic&#13;
transport planning in the large cities as Nairobi and Mombasa) need to be addressed over time, these issues,&#13;
although important, are not as urgent as the need to improve road maintenance capacity of the local&#13;
authorities.  Instilling maintenance discipline among the local authorities is critical to any sector&#13;
development effort.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II.    TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A.    Transport and the Economy&#13;
2.01    Kenya has five major transport systems - roads, railways, maritime transport, pipeline transport&#13;
and air transport networks. The heaviest concentration of transport facilities is along the transport corridor&#13;
from the port of Mombasa through the capital, Nairobi, continuing on to the western region and to the&#13;
Kenya/Uganda border. The railway network is about 1,920 km, including 1,085 km of main lines, 345 km&#13;
of principal line and 490 km of branch lines. The main line connects the Mombasa port to Nairobi and&#13;
continues to the Uganda border. The total road network is about 160,000 km long, including about 63,000&#13;
km of classified roads under the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH) and about 91,000 km of&#13;
local authority roads under the MLG and various local authorities. The balance of the road network&#13;
represents special purpose roads, such as in the national wildlife parks. Primary responsibility for the&#13;
transport system is vested in four autonomous parastatal entities: the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), Kenya&#13;
Railways Corporation (KR), Kenya Airways (KA) and Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC); as well as with&#13;
MPWH for the national highway system and the classified roads, and with MLG for local authorities' road&#13;
system. Government regulation of the transport sector is minimal and market forces are generally the basis&#13;
for traffic allocation. Road transport dominates the overall transport sector and almost entirely belongs in&#13;
the private sector (the pipeline's monopoly of movement of petroleum products is the major exception).&#13;
The road transport industry is competitive and relatively efficient. Bus and mini-bus (matatu) transport&#13;
diominate the fare paying passenger transport market and, like truck transport, nearly all public transport is&#13;
private (the exception is the government's Nyayo Bus Service Corporation which came into operation in&#13;
1989).&#13;
2.02    The transport sector has changed considerably in Kenya since its independence in 1963; most&#13;
notably with the development of the road network and the decline in the role and importance of rail&#13;
transport. A major program of road investments (many of them supported by IDA) expanded the network&#13;
of paved roads from about 1,800 km in 1963 to about 8,600 km in 1994. Introduction of heavy&#13;
commercial vehicles also substantially reduced road transport costs.  During the 1980's, declining&#13;
efficiency and effective capacity of the railway resulted in falling traffic levels from 4.3 million tonnes in&#13;
1980 to 2.5 million tonnes in 1993. Railway's share of total freight transport income halved from 62% in&#13;
1972 to 33% in 1990. The decline in railway capacity is increasing the importance of the road transport&#13;
network. However, inadequate road network and the poor condition of the roads are fast becoming serious&#13;
constraints to mobility and are adding to transportation costs. Efficient movement of agricultural produce&#13;
and perishable commodities has become a major problem in many areas of the country, particularly during&#13;
the rainy season. The manufacturing sub-sector is also being equally disadvantaged. Road transport&#13;
currently is the prime mode for freight and passenger transport, and its importance will increase with time&#13;
in Kenya. An efficient and well functioning road transport system will continue to remain an important&#13;
cost effective alternative to rail, for both domestic transport needs and to provide the interface with&#13;
international shipping for transit traffic for the neighboring countries.&#13;
2.03    The overall contribution of the transport, storage and communication sub-sector, to the GDP has&#13;
been estimated at about 8% in recent years. The Kenyan transport system is not only essential to its&#13;
domestic economy but is also very significant as a primary transit network for the neighboring countries in&#13;
the eastern Africa region. Transit traffic generates foreign exchange earnings of about US$70 million&#13;
annually for Kenya. Transport was not a major constraint to Kenya's economic growth until about the&#13;
mid-1980's and Kenya enjoyed a higher standard of transport infrastructure and lower transport costs than&#13;
most countries in the region. However, the transport system is now beginning to be perceived as a serious&#13;
impediment to economic growth. The prospects for expanding Kenya's traditional exports are limited. The&#13;
GOK's current economic reform program recognizes that future growth must be led by export oriented non-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
traditional commodities, particularly manufactures. The quality of Kenya's land transport system is&#13;
inadequate to support such future growth and the diversification of production and exports.&#13;
B.    Transport Sector Issues&#13;
2.04    Kenya's overall transport system is currently facing severe difficulties.  General transport&#13;
conditions are deteriorating in terms of quality and service delivery standards. Unless this situation is&#13;
urgently arrested and the trend reversed, the transport system will increasingly become a major constraint&#13;
to economic and social development in Kenya. Today's key problems in Kenya's transport sector have their&#13;
roots in several factors: (a) deteriorating infrastructure conditions due to lack of maintenance, despite&#13;
considerable capital investments in recent years; (b) weak management and institutional capacity of the&#13;
key transport sectors agencies and parastatals; and, (c) inefficient operational systems, procedures and&#13;
complex regulatory framework, such as customs procedures, making the transport system particularly&#13;
vulnerable in the external trade-transport subsector.&#13;
C.    Road Transport System&#13;
2.05     Roads and road transport are crucial parts of Kenya's economic infrastructure. Trucks account&#13;
for nearly 100% of short distance haulage. Today the primary mode of freight transport and personal&#13;
travel is dominated by truck, car and bus. The road network is one of the largest investments that has been&#13;
made in Kenya since independence. The urban road network is about 10,000 km, of which about 2,000 km&#13;
are paved. About 62% of all urban roads are in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu (36% in Nairobi alone).&#13;
While most investments have so far been directed to the main road network, there has also been a&#13;
considerable investments directed at expanding the coverage of the classified rural network through the&#13;
special crop-oriented programs (tea, sugar and wheat roads) and the Rural Access Roads Programme&#13;
(RARP). The RARP was started in the early 1970's and over 8,000 km of all-weather rural access roads,&#13;
using labor-intensive construction methods, have been constructed so far. The roads under the RARP are&#13;
now maintained under the Minor Roads Programme - a multi-donor supported prograrnme. There are now&#13;
over 11,000 km of rural roads which have been improved and are now maintained under the Minor Roads&#13;
Programme. Through the RARP and Minor Road Programme, Kenya is now an acknowledged world&#13;
leader in labor based road construction and maintenance techniques.&#13;

2.06    The major problem in Kenya's road sector today is not a lack of network capacity, but the poor&#13;
quality of the roads. Kenya is one of the countries included in the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy&#13;
(SSATP) programme's Road Maintenance Initiative (RMI). A major RMI seminar was held in Kenya in&#13;
1992 which identified, inter alia, the immediate problem of inadequate road maintenance in Kenya.&#13;
Rapidly deteriorating roads are increasingly becoming inefficient to support growing economic activities.&#13;
Expenditures in the road sector have so far been primarily targeted towards the main road network&#13;
(highway system and inter-urban roads) through MPWH and towards the rural roads network through the&#13;
RARP and the Minor Roads Programme. However, these expenditures have so far reflected preference for&#13;
new construction over routine and periodic maintenance. Table II. 1 (above) shows recent expenditure on&#13;
the classified road network in Kenya.&#13;
2.07    While investments have been made for the classified network over the past decades, the intra-&#13;
urban network (i.e., roads within the towns and urban centers) have been neglected in terms of new&#13;
investments as well as maintenance financing. In 1968, the road network was found to be deteriorating,&#13;
partly because of vehicle overloading, but mainly because road maintenance by the local authorities was&#13;
inadequate. To improve the situation, central government assumed responsibility for the maintenance for&#13;
the entire classified road network. Road maintenance improved considerably until 1975 when it began to&#13;
decline because of insufficient funds for recurrent expenditure.  Periodic maintenance (resealing and&#13;
regravelling), as well as routine maintenance, were cut back substantially.  Although reliable data&#13;
indicating the level and composition of expenditures for intra-urban roads is not readily available, it is&#13;
generally acknowledged that such expenditures (for both new investments and maintenance) have been&#13;
minimal. Neglect over many years has resulted in much of the network deteriorating to the point where&#13;
rehabilitation is necessary before maintenance is possible.&#13;
2.08    According to the Project Completion Reports of prior road projects, these projects experienced&#13;
implementation delays, cost overruns and their economic retums were generally below the appraisal&#13;
estimates. However, these projects were, on the whole, completed satisfactorily and met their two principal&#13;
development objectives: (a) reduced vehicle operating costs; and (b) improved rural accessibility. From&#13;
the implementation of these projects it has become increasingly apparent that much greater emphasis has to&#13;
be given to the issue of long-term sustainability in the sector. The issues of adequate maintenance caoacity&#13;
and increased domestic funding for maintenance have become central to the long-term sustainability of all&#13;
road sector investments. Achieving sustainability will require substantial assistance to remove the backlog&#13;
of periodic maintenance, starting an urgently needed rehabilitation work program and strengthening&#13;
capacity of sector institutions.&#13;
D.    Financing Road Maintenance&#13;
2.09    Because the economic costs of poor road infrastructure are not so apparent as, for example,&#13;
inadequate electric power or water supply, road maintenance and improvements have generally received a&#13;
lower priority in budgetary allocations than warranted by their true economic value. As roads fall from a&#13;
maintainable condition to one requiring rehabilitation or reconstruction, the cost rises dramatically. It is&#13;
estimated that a cost of K Sh I to maintain a stretch of paved road rises to K Sh 13 to rehabilitate and K&#13;
Sh 36 to reconstruct it. For unpaved roads, the corresponding ratio is about 1:8 to 1: 10.&#13;
2.10    At the national level, the overall expenditure on roads (development plus maintenance) fell&#13;
steadily during the 1980s dropping from 5.5% of total expenditures in FY84 to 2.7% in FY87. Likewise,&#13;
the share of road maintenance in total road expenditures also fell from 31% in FY84 to 19% in FY87.&#13;
Seen over a longer time period, the share of the central government's recurrent budget allocated to road&#13;
maintenance fell from 3.2% in 1976 to 0.5% in 1992, and the share for urban roads, transferred by the&#13;
government to municipalities, declined to almost negligible amounts. Although central government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
revenues from road transport - fuel taxes, vehicle import duties, licenses - have risen substantially as a&#13;
share of total revenues in recent years, such increases have not been directed for maintenance to kept pace&#13;
with both the current and deferred needs. GOK is currently attempting to bring down a large budget&#13;
deficit, and is in a difficult position to substantially increase road maintenance funding from its present&#13;
revenues. The result is that without a new source of revenue, road maintenance would continue to be&#13;
under-funded and much of the road network, including nearly all urban roads, would drop into the more&#13;
costly rehabilitation and reconstruction categories. Nor would there be any scope for increasing the&#13;
capacity of the road network through new investments to meet rising traffic demands.&#13;
E.    Road Maintenance Levy Fund&#13;
2.11    Against this difficult setting, GOK has taken a very positive step which holds out the promise of&#13;
a sustainable solution to the national and urban road maintenance problems. In late 1993, and amended in&#13;
May 1994, it enacted a Road Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF). The RMLF will derive most of its revenue&#13;
from a levy on the sales of petroleum fuels and, to a lesser extent, from the toll charges levied on vehicles&#13;
transiting through Kenya. Once the RMLF is operating, the system of domestic road tolls, which currently&#13;
generates some of the funds for the periodic maintenance of the main paved road network, will be removed.&#13;
The initial level of the levy is expected to yield approximately K Sh 1,500 million during FY95. Even with&#13;
this promising start, the initial K Sh 1,500 million in RMLF resources in FY95 is not likely to be adequate&#13;
for meeting the minimum maintenance requirements of the country's road network. In the absence of&#13;
reliable technical data, overall funding requirement for maintenance can not be estimated at present with&#13;
any degree of accuracy. However, a realistic (within budget and technical constraints) minimum&#13;
maintenance program is roughly estimated at K Sh 2,600 million in 1994/95 prices, of which about K Sh&#13;
600 million would be needed for urban road maintenance during FY95. Over the long term, in 1994/95&#13;
prices, as much as K Sh 8,000 million could be used annually by the year 2000 for reasonable level of&#13;
maintenance of the road network (of which about K Sh 1,500 million - K Sh 2,000 million could be used&#13;
for the public roads under the MLG). These are best estimates currently determinable which will require&#13;
fiurther analysis and refinement.&#13;
2.12    The government recognizes that the immediate yield of the RMLF alone is not going to be&#13;
adequate to make a credible start at addressing the issue of deferred road maintenance. It is currently&#13;
reviewing various options to increase the initial funding base for road maintenance financing. GOK has&#13;
indicated that given the significance of this issue, despite current tight budgetary situation, it will start&#13;
supplementing the RMLF resources for road maintenance through budgetary allocations. Even with this, it&#13;
is likely that overall maintenance funding will be at levels below the full funding requirement to start with.&#13;
Therefore, GOK has agreed to gradually increase maintenance funding levels to match the growth in&#13;
maintenance capacity of the agencies concerned with the road sector as a whole. Through both budgetary&#13;
allocation and annual adjustment of the level of the RMLF levy, GOK expects to gradually increase the&#13;
overall resources for maintenance, such that, over a period of 5-6 years, sufficient funds would be available&#13;
to maintain all roads in Kenya. The eventual size of the RMLF, supplemented by budgetary allocations,&#13;
required for full maintenance funding of the system, will need to be further refined and updated as more&#13;
reliable data on actual experience is accumulated. The operational modalities for the RMLF also need to&#13;
be fully developed.&#13;
2.13   The government, in its Macro-economic and Structural Policy Framework document for 1995-97,&#13;
submitted to the Consultative Group Meeting in December 1994, undertook to raise domestic funding for&#13;
road maintenance to 50% of full maintenance needs in FY96 and to full funding by the year 2000. The&#13;
government has agreed with IDA a detailed annual maintenance funding plan for the overall road network,&#13;
including the urban road network, consistent with this undertaking.&#13;

III.   THE URBAN TRANSPORT SUBSECTOR&#13;
A.    Sector Overview&#13;
3.01    Urban transport in Kenya was recognized as an emerging issue late in the 1970s, but over the&#13;
past twenty years the sector has not received serious attention. Traffic growth has outstripped the&#13;
government's capacity to provide adequate road infrastructure and the backlog and deterioration of the&#13;
roads are visually evident. In the major towns, such as Nairobi and Mombasa, there is no adequate system&#13;
of by-passes to avoid inter city traffic from passing through the cities. Congestion has become a problem,&#13;
particularly affecting Nairobi and other urban centers. The proportion of roads rated in good condition in&#13;
Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu fell from 24% to 10% during 1988 to 1993. In the major towns, road&#13;
condition problems are compounded by the density of traffic during peak periods. Travel time in peak&#13;
hours in Nairobi is estimate to be twice that of non-peak hours. These poor road conditions and congestion&#13;
impose serious economic costs in terms of lost productive time, wasted fuel, increased vehicle maintenance&#13;
and repair costs, higher traffic casualties, and environmental pollution. For Nairobi alone, it is estimated&#13;
that at least 14 million vehicle-hours were lost due to congestion in 1992. Without road improvements that&#13;
figure is estimated to rise to 50 million vehicle-hours by 2002. This translates to an estimated waste of 63&#13;
million liters of fuel worth US$25 million (ex-taxes and duties) per year by 2002. Additionally, the annual&#13;
costs of vehicle repairs and depreciation necessitated by poor urban road conditions in Nairobi is estimated,&#13;
using MPWH coefficients, at about US$22 million by 2002. The current problems have also been&#13;
compounded by ineffective urban transport management policies, poor physical planning, growing spatial&#13;
constraints and inadequate traffic demand management.&#13;
3.02    The type of urban transport that people use in their daily business is determined by the&#13;
availability and affordability of different modes. In Kenya's urban areas, these factors make walking the&#13;
dominant mode, even when only the most important trips, usually the work trips, are considered. If all trips&#13;
were considered, including those to-and-from public transport, the percentage of walking trips would be&#13;
considerably higher. In Mombasa, the share of important trips made on foot is relatively high (61%)&#13;
compared to Nairobi (24%-44%, depending on the survey); other towns more closely resemble Mombasa&#13;
than Nairobi in this respect. Bicycle traffic, similarly, is higher in Mombasa (7%) than in Nairobi (4%),&#13;
and higher in the smaller towns where it is safer. By contrast, cars are a more important mode in Nairobi&#13;
(22%-38%, depending on the survey) than in Mombasa (18%). Public transport accounted for 14% of&#13;
trips in both cities in the early 1970s, but grew to a reported 50% share in Nairobi in the 1980s. Buses and&#13;
matatus (smaller privately owned vehicles for public passenger transport) share the market approximately&#13;
equally. Ferry service is an important mode in Mombasa.&#13;
3.03    Various government agencies (police, town councils and ministries) are responsible for enforcing&#13;
traffic regulation, vehicle inspections and, most importantly, financing, maintaining and extending major&#13;
transport infrastructure. MLG and the local authorities have the primary responsibility for maintaining&#13;
local roads. MPWH is responsible for all trunk roads running into or through urban areas. The Transport&#13;
Management Unit (TMU) of the Urban Development Department of MLG has the primary responsibility&#13;
for providing technical support to local authorities in transport planning and management, and the Roads&#13;
Department of MPWH provides some of the local authorities with technical assistance in works and loans&#13;
them minor equipment.&#13;
B.    Key Sector Issues&#13;
3.04   At the GOK's request, the Bank prepared a Sector Study during 1989-90 entitled "Kenya: Urban&#13;
Transport Development Issues", (Report No. 7881-KE, May 9, 1990) which proposed a program of policy&#13;
and institutional reforms and investments for Nairobi and other large towns. The Study identified several&#13;
issues which needed to be resolved to improve Kenya's urban transport infrastructure system. The key&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
among them were:  (a) adopting an investment policy framework to ensure allocative efficiency; (b)&#13;
strengthening the planning, management and operational capacity of sector agencies; (c) improving road&#13;
safety; (d) enlarging the revenue base of local authorities; (e) developing a metropolitan growth strategy&#13;
which relieves development pressures in Nairobi; (f) establishing and enforcing appropriate demand&#13;
management policies and programs; (g) increasing the efficiency of public transport operations; and, (h)&#13;
defining the role of the government in public transportation. While all of the above issues are significant to&#13;
urban transport problems in Kenya, urgent emphasis needs to be placed on improving basic maintenance&#13;
and strengthening maintenance management capacity in the sub-sector.&#13;
C.    Sector Development Constraints&#13;
3.05     Inadequate financial resources for maintenance has been a critical problem in urban transport&#13;
sub-sector. The problems of urban road quality and congestion cannot be solved without much greater&#13;
financial resources to meet the backlog of investments as well as to increase their sustainability with higher&#13;
maintenance expenditures. Almost all urban road financing is intended to come from local authority&#13;
revenues, which at present are insufficient to maintain their roads even if all were in maintainable&#13;
condition. In recent years, total road expenditures have been less than 60% of what was needed (based on&#13;
technical coefficients) for maintenance alone, leaving little or none for rehabilitation or new investments to&#13;
keep pace with rising traffic demand. The solution to the financial problem is a necessary but not sufficient&#13;
condition for achieving a sustainable solution to a rapidly developing urban transport crisis.&#13;
3.06     Weak technical and institutional capacity at the local authority level has also been a significant&#13;
cause of deteriorating road conditions. One of the most important of these is the lack of capacity of local&#13;
authority engineering staff. In the absence of necessary quality and experience of the engineering staff, the&#13;
quality of the physical works have suffered. Virtually all maintenance work has been traditionally reserved&#13;
for execution by the local authorities' work forces. Furthermore, meager local authority budgets leave little&#13;
money for operating expenses after salaries are paid. Planning capacity is poor in most local authorities,&#13;
and expansion plans for road networks seldom exist or, if they do exist, are not based on efficiency criteria.&#13;
Managerial training is weak. Under financially constrained conditions, managers can not make effective&#13;
use of existing staff for tasks which require additional cash outlays, so staff are idle much of the time.&#13;
Even when resources are made available to patch potholes or seal cracks, maintenance laborers are&#13;
normally fielded without proper supervision or technical training, and often do the job incorrectly, leading&#13;
to failure and costly repeat of the repairs. Maintenance of equipment takes a very low priority, and costly&#13;
new equipment is often purchased when relatively simple repairs would return existing equipment to&#13;
service. There is no incentive system in place to either encourage or reward good maintenance performance&#13;
by local authorities and their staff.&#13;
3.07     Increasing maintenance management capacity and changing maintenance arrangements&#13;
require urgent attention. There is a clear need to move away from urban road maintenance by force&#13;
account of the local authorities towards contracting out such services. Doing urban road maintenance by&#13;
contract could yield substantially more value for each maintenance shilling compared to the costs of force&#13;
account work. The private sector capacity exists in Kenya for such a shift. Most periodic maintenance&#13;
on the classified paved road network (inter-city) is currently performed by contract and substantial on-&#13;
the-job training of contractors has been provided in regravelling roads.  Thus through previous&#13;
investments made by Kenya in constructing and rehabilitating the major highway network, considerable&#13;
local contracting and engineering capacity in this field has been developed. Efforts are also underway&#13;
to involve smaller contractors in undertaking routine maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
D.    Priority Action Program&#13;
3.08    In the context of these issues, the Sector Study identified an action program. In the short-term,&#13;
there is a need to: (a) undertake a program of road maintenance and rehabilitation, with emphasis on&#13;
building maintenance capacity; (b) improve traffic management; (c) build missing links in the road&#13;
network; (d) expand the capacity of congested main traffic arteries; (e) improve travel conditions for public&#13;
transport vehicles; (f) improve parking control and revenues; (g) improve travel conditions for pedestrians;&#13;
and (h) reduce road accidents. A major part of this effort should focus on: (a) the central areas where&#13;
traffic congestion is most acute; (b) better accessibility for low income/high population density areas; and&#13;
(c) the industrial areas which suffer from poor accessibility. In some of the major towns there is also a&#13;
need to undertake extension work of the road network.&#13;
E.    Implementation Experience and Lessons Learned&#13;
3.09    The Bank's involvement in the urban sector started with the Nairobi Sites and Services Project&#13;
(Cr. 543-KE and Ln. 1105-KE) in 1975, followed by the Second Urban Project (Cr. 791-KE and Ln.&#13;
1550-KE) in 1978. In 1983, in parallel with the implementation of the Second Urban project, the&#13;
Secondary Towns Project (Cr. 1390-KE and Ln. 2319-KE) was initiated and completed in 1991. The&#13;
lessons leamed from the Secondary Towns Project, as well as prior projects in the sector, are documented&#13;
in the "Performance Audit Report: Kenya: Secondary Towns Project", (Report No. 13127, June 9, 1994.)&#13;
3.10   Previous experience with urban projects, as well as with road sector projects, and their&#13;
implementation record in Kenya hold a number of useful lessons.&#13;
*  Project design must reflect the intent, interests and priorities of the beneficiaries and the&#13;
stakeholders to ensure ownership of the project.&#13;
&#149;  There must be an emphasis on capacity building of project agencies. Experience in Kenya&#13;
and elsewhere confirn that sustained project impact depends less on the physical works&#13;
financed and more on well-managed, well-financed executing agencies.&#13;
*  The respective roles, responsibilities and benefits to all parties involved in the project need to&#13;
be clearly articulated and agreed upon before implementation begins. Effective participation&#13;
by the beneficiaries and the stakeholders of the project throughout the project cycle (planning,&#13;
design and implementation) is essential for sustained development impact.&#13;
*  Explicit provision for adequate (and assured) domestic funding for maintenance must be&#13;
made for project-financed infrastructure to ensure sustainability after project completion.&#13;
*  In general, any first effort in a sector, or a subsector, needs to be supported by a sustained&#13;
sector dialogue aimed at defining and implementing the necessary institutional and financial&#13;
reforms to achieve goals and policies. Follow-up operations, appropriately timed, are required&#13;
to cement gains and extend policy and institutional gains which may be left incomplete by the&#13;
predecessor project.&#13;
3.11   These lessons are particularly relevant for the proposed Urban Transport Infrastructure Project.&#13;
The proposed project is the first of its kind in Kenya, aimed at improving the conditions and maintenance&#13;
environment of the urban roads nationally (in 1979, the Bank had appraised an Urban Transport Project for&#13;
Nairobi but, in 1981, with agreement of the government, dropped the project due to domestic budget&#13;
constraints). Because the proposed project covers up to 26 relatively weak and geographically dispersed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
local authorities, project preparation efforts and project design reflect deliberate and sustained dialogue&#13;
between IDA, GOK, MLG, and both the executives and the public representatives of the local authorities.&#13;
This dialogue has been carried out through a series of workshops and on-site consultations between the&#13;
technicians, the executives and elected public representatives. This has helped to create a strong sense of&#13;
ownership of the project in both the national government and in the local authorities. An inter-ministerial&#13;
technical committee, which also includes representatives of the local authorities, meets regularly to review&#13;
project preparation and resolve problems. This consultative and decision making mechanism will continue&#13;
during implementation. In addition, based on prior experience, the project will emphasize upstream&#13;
implementation of reporting, auditing and accountability measures to ensure early detection and remedy of&#13;
implementation problems. The central theme of the project, as discussed later, is improved maintenance.&#13;
Although the proposed project mainly focuses on the improvement of the urban road network, these&#13;
investments have been considered in the context of a broader set of long-term municipal financial and&#13;
administrative reforms. To support these initiatives and to extend the principles of better maintenance&#13;
discipline, the proposed project also includes support for preparing a future municipal investment program,&#13;
covering other basic infrastructure services.&#13;
F.    Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
3.12    The proposed project is fully consistent with GOK's development objectives as well as the Bank&#13;
Group's country and sector assistance strategy. Improving the urban road network would support the&#13;
government's objective of directing public expenditures towards improving a basic service for the poor, as&#13;
well as other road users, thus also benefiting the economy through improving infrastructure to promote&#13;
growth of private sector activities and encourage private investment. It would also support the Bank&#13;
Group's objective of participating in sustainable investments because of the project's emphasis on improved&#13;
physical maintenance and on building maintenance capacity of sector agencies. It would complement the&#13;
broader agenda of municipal reforms, which itself will require over a decade to achieve, but are considered&#13;
essential to ensure sustainability of all municipal infrastructure investments, including investments in the&#13;
urban road network.&#13;
3.13    The project would constitute the first phase of a much larger potential GOK program of urban&#13;
road improvements, which could extend for a decade or more and cost over US$300 million, including&#13;
maintenance costs. It would promote and encourage a broader government initiative to fundamentally&#13;
reform the policy and operational framework for road infrastructure maintenance throughout Kenya and&#13;
support the institutional strengthening efforts which this would require. The project would also complement&#13;
the Bank Group on-going support for the classified road network and rural roads in Kenya.&#13;
3.14    GOK is fully committed to the comprehensive long-term program but lacks the domestic&#13;
technical and financial capacity to implement it. The large scale of the required investments in the urban&#13;
transport sub-sector requires considerable external financing besides significant domestic resources.&#13;
However, due to the number and complexity of the sector issues involved, no other donor has yet shown&#13;
serious interest in this sub-sector. IDA involvement at this stage is the best option for initiating major and&#13;
lasting improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
IV.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Origin&#13;
4.01    Based on the identified sector development issues and the recommended program of actions,&#13;
MLG began developing a sub-sector investment program in 1991. The project represents a portion of the&#13;
government's overall urban transport improvement program for 26 towns (four large towns - Nairobi,&#13;
Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and 22 other smaller rapidly growing towns). Through project preparation&#13;
activities, MLG has identified a physical investment program of about US$260 million over the next 6&#13;
years for routine and periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and improvements in the 26 towns. The project&#13;
covers about 47% (US$123 million) of the physical investments included in this program as a first phase&#13;
of the development effort.&#13;
4.02    While intervention on many fronts are required in the subsector, the project has been designed to&#13;
explicitly address road maintenance and rehabilitation as a priority. Improving maintenance performance&#13;
and addressing the financial and institutional problems surrounding it, are the most critical actions&#13;
necessary to start solving today's urban transport problems. Improving maintenance performance is a&#13;
necessary prerequisite to any sector development effort. The government recognizes that other reform&#13;
issues, such as more effective demand management policies, better enforcement of traffic regulations,&#13;
increasing efficiency and improving management of public transport entities, etc., while important, are not&#13;
as urgent as improving maintenance capacity and instilling maintenance discipline in the local authorities.&#13;
The project, however, lays the groundwork to address these broader sector issues over time, recognizing&#13;
that they are difficult to implement in the short term.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
4.03    The objectives of the project are to: (i) increase economic efficiency of the urban road network;&#13;
and (ii) build sustainable road maintenance capacity - institutional, financial and engineering - of the&#13;
project towns and the MLG through a program of municipal reforms. The project represents a substantial&#13;
investment by the government in Kenya's urban centers for the benefit of the national economy. The&#13;
project would serve to: (i) establish adequate maintenance capacity and encourage basic maintenance&#13;
discipline in all the local authorities and assist the MLG to efficiently plan, manage and finance the&#13;
maintenance of urban roads; (ii) improve the conditions of the urban roads which are deteriorating rapidly,&#13;
through a balanced investment program of routine and periodic maintenance, rehabilitation, improvements&#13;
and improved traffic management measures in the project towns; (iii) direct investments towards those&#13;
segments of the urban road network in the project towns which are used largely by the poor and improve&#13;
the latter's access to non-motorized transport facilities; (iv) introduce measures to increase implementation&#13;
efficiency through increased use of existing private sector capacity for both construction and maintenance;&#13;
and (v) improve management, financial and operational practices of the project towns aimed at&#13;
strengthening their capacity to better finance and maintain road infrastructure.&#13;
4.04    While the primary objective of this project is to improve urban transport infrastructure&#13;
management and its efficiency, with particular emphasis on maintenance, needs and concems of the urban&#13;
poor have been considered through specific project design and selection criteria. The design of road&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement works was specifically broadened from traditional approaches to place&#13;
emphasis on footpaths and other facilities for non-motorized road users. The criteria for selecting the&#13;
location of road works specifically identified needs in the low-income areas of each town, along with those&#13;
of industrial areas and city centers. In many cases, improvements were selected to improve travel between&#13;
these areas, increasing the access of the urban poor to jobs and city services. This was achieved through&#13;
off-road paths or footpath and cycle track improvements even where the road itself was otherwise not&#13;
considered for rehabilitation or maintenance. The project supports pilot works of the Non-Motorized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Transport (NMT) Study undertaken by the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Programme (SSATP).&#13;
This program looks more deeply at the mobility needs of low-income urban communities, and identifies&#13;
small-scale works designed to meet these needs. The traffic management component of the project includes&#13;
provision for minor improvements to intersections, pedestrian crossings and bus stops, aimned at safety,&#13;
congestion and public transport needs. While this component is not directly targeted at the poor, many of&#13;
its benefits will accrue to pedestrians and bus passengers--most of whom are the poor.&#13;
C.    Project Preparation&#13;
4.05    The project has been prepared by the TMU, financed by a Project Preparation Facility (Nos.&#13;
635-0, 635-1 and 635-2) in the amount of US$2.0 million. The PPF funds have been utilized for: (a)&#13;
identifying high priority and high return sub-projects and completing their detailed engineering design; (b) a&#13;
study of traffic management improvement requirements in Nairobi; (c) preparing a roads inventory and&#13;
other traffic indicators for establishing an initial base for the allocation of the RMLF receipts between the&#13;
two major claimants - MLG and MPWH - and from MLG to the local authorities; (d) defining&#13;
implementation arrangements, including development of the implementation manual; (e) designing the work&#13;
program  for a maintenance management and  works inspectorate; (f) conducting physical routine&#13;
maintenance audits in project towns, (g) defining institutional arrangements and termns of reference for the&#13;
construction supervision consultants; (h) up-stream financing of technology capacity building and design of&#13;
a computerized project management and contract/procurement management system; and, (i) preparing&#13;
various terms of references and draft bid documents. In addition, consultant support through a bilateral&#13;
grant from the Belgium government of about US$800,000 equivalent also assisted the TMU in detailed&#13;
engineering designs of the project investments.&#13;

4.07    These components are summarized in the following paragraphs; detailed descriptions are&#13;
contained in ANNEX 3.&#13;
(a)  Road and Transport Infrastructure Investments&#13;
Road Transport Infrastructure Investments comprise: routine maintenance of about 2,000&#13;
km of streets in the project towns in accordance with programs and performance standards&#13;
agreed with the TMU; periodic maintenance of about 400 km of priority paved streets,&#13;
mainly pavement resealing and complementary minor repairs; rehabilitation of about 400&#13;
km of priority paved streets (to restore them to as-built condition) consisting of major&#13;
pavement repairs, resealing and repair of roadside infrastructure; road and traffic&#13;
management improvements including construction of strategic missing links, road&#13;
widening, pavement strengthening and road junction improvements (including related&#13;
equipment), the latter mainly in Nairobi totaling about 75 km. Traffic management&#13;
measures, pedestrian paths and other improvements which directly affect the urban poor&#13;
not only form an integral part of overall project design, but their implementation will also&#13;
support the regional partnership initiative under the SSATP. The latter will include&#13;
construction and improvement of NMT infrastructure in an integrated network concept (in&#13;
addition to bicycle and footpaths included with road rehabilitation and other works). The&#13;
extent, design and implementation arrangements for these NMT facilities and other pilot&#13;
investments will be based on the findings and recommendations of the SSATP study for&#13;
Kenya, during first phase of project implementation, as described in ANNEX 4.&#13;
(b)  Capacity Building&#13;
The capacity building program  comprises mainly of short-term  specialist technical&#13;
assistance (totaling about 60 man-months over the first three years of the project), to the&#13;
TMU and various local authorities, in key aspects of maintenance planning and project&#13;
implementation.  A comprehensive maintenance management and budgeting system,&#13;
guidelines for technical review of design standards and a rigorous procurement&#13;
management systems will be established within the TMU. The component provides for the&#13;
establishment (including equipment) and functioning of a maintenance management and&#13;
works inspectorate function, to oversee and assist the local authorities to improve their&#13;
routine road maintenance performance and to effectively use the maintenance funds&#13;
allocated to them. Also included in this component are: (a) development and training for&#13;
local authority staff, TMU and MLG staff, with particular focus on strengthening their&#13;
planning and implementation capacity; (b) local authority roads network data base&#13;
development, condition survey and maintenance budget analysis; and (c) support for&#13;
conducting periodic workshops and seminars involving the project towns for the purpose of&#13;
exchanging information/experience and for an open review of maintenance and&#13;
implementation performance by individual project towns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
(c)  Program and Policy Studies&#13;
These are priority studies of the two largest urban areas (Nairobi and Mombasa), to&#13;
provide a longer-term basis for future planning of investments.  In addition to the&#13;
immediate physical works to improve Nairobi's traffic management conditions, a long-term&#13;
land use and transport demand study for Nairobi will be undertaken under the project. A&#13;
study to formulate a long-term sector investment strategy and needs for Mombasa, in the&#13;
context of its unique drainage problems, will be undertaken. Draft terms of reference for&#13;
these studies will be included in the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
(d)  Project Implementation Support&#13;
This component primarily consists of consultants' support for the overall implementation&#13;
of the works program and to advise/assist the TMU with the procurement process for civil&#13;
works contracts and detailed design of future investments. To effectively supervise and&#13;
monitor the progress of the project activities, necessary hardware, network and&#13;
communication facilities and application software packages will be procured.  To&#13;
maximize the benefit of new maintenance planning, procedures and monitoring systems&#13;
and to institutionalize this process for all towns under the MLG, including towns not&#13;
covered under the project, the Credit will finance the additional costs to the TMU&#13;
(incremental operating cost) for such activities.&#13;
(e)  Future Project Preparation Support&#13;
Future project preparation support, by way of technical assistance to MLG for studies,&#13;
design and implementation arrangements for defining a municipal investment program and&#13;
necessary institutional and financial reforms.   These activities will support and&#13;
complement efforts under the MRP. Such activities will include, inter alia, improving&#13;
maintenance and investment planning, resource mobilization and expenditure management&#13;
practices for other municipal services. These initiatives would be based on the experience&#13;
gained in implementing the proposed project as well as the MRP and the lessons learned&#13;
would be applied to other sub-sectors or activities managed by local authorities. Possible&#13;
demonstration projects in selected towns would serve as centers for further training and&#13;
capacity building of local authorities' staff.&#13;
E.    Project Costs and Financing&#13;
4.08    Project Costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$155.0 million equivalent.&#13;
Project components include: US$118.5 million for road and transport infrastructure investments, US$14.5&#13;
million for capacity building, US$0.8 million for program and policy studies, US$19.7 million for project&#13;
implementation support, and US$1.5 million for future project preparation support. Of the total cost,&#13;
about US$62.0 million or 40% would be in foreign costs and the balance in local costs. The cost estimates&#13;
include about US$9.5 million in physical contingencies or about 8% of the total base costs, and US$18.0&#13;
million in price contingencies or about 14% of the total base costs. The price contingencies have been&#13;
calculated on the basis of estimated international inflation of 2.6% from FY1995/96 onwards for both&#13;
foreign and local inflation (based on the project exchange rate of US$1.00 = K Sh 55.00 as of October&#13;
1995) expressed in terms of US$. A summary of the cost estimates is provided in Table IV. 1.&#13;

4.09           Project Financing. The total project cost of US$155.0 million equivalent would be financed as&#13;
shown in Table IV.2. An IDA credit of US$115.0 million would finance about 74% of the total project&#13;
costs. The government would contribute about US$40.0 million or about 26% of total project cost,&#13;
ncluding about US$4.2 million equivalent in taxes and duties. Annual expenditures under the project is&#13;
included in ANNEX 5. Additional investments which have been identified during project preparation&#13;
(totaling about US$138.0 million in periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and improvements in all 26 towns)&#13;
which are not included in the project are also indicated in ANNEX 5 as a "reserve program". Preliminary&#13;
design for these investments have been completed and are available for financing by other interested&#13;
donors. Project components by financier is included in ANNEX 6.&#13;

F.    Procurement&#13;
4.10    Table IV.3 summarizes the estimated costs of the project financed works, goods and services by&#13;
category. All procurement procedures for IDA financed contracts would be consistent with IDA&#13;
requirements. Agreement has been reached with the government to use the Bank's "Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for Smaller Civil Works" (applicable to civil works contracts of under about US$10 million)&#13;
for ICB. Goods and consulting services would be procured also using Bank standard documents, with&#13;
appropriate modifications to meet project needs. Contracts for works not financed by the project (mostly&#13;
routine maintenance works) would use local documents and procedures, satisfactory to the IDA.&#13;
4.11    Civil Works. IDA financed civil works contracts (for all other than routine maintenance) would&#13;
be carried out under ICB procedures satisfactory to IDA. Eligible domestic contractors bidding for civil&#13;
works contracts under ICB would receive a 7.5%  percent preference in bid evaluation.  Routine&#13;
maintenance, which is estimated to cost US$27.3 million, is spread over 26 towns and is spaced over time,&#13;
with the bulk of the expenditures being financed by GOK resources.&#13;
4.12    Goods. Equipment estimated to cost US$2.1 million would be procured through ICB following&#13;
the Bank guidelines and using Bank Sample Documents with appropriate modifications.&#13;
4.13    Consultant Services and Training. Consultant services estimated at about US$7.2 million&#13;
would be carried out by consultants recruited internationally in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants." Consultancy services for simple design works and construction supervision,&#13;
estimated to cost about US$17.9 million, would be requested from both qualified local firms and locally&#13;
established international firms. Consultancy services totaling about US$1.7 million for future project&#13;
preparation, design and pilot works would be requested from both qualified local firms and locally&#13;
established international firms. Kenya has an emerging, competitive consultancy service sector and&#13;
including them for supervision would be appropriate and cost-effective because of the widely dispersed&#13;
nature of the project. Locally established international firms would also be expected to use mainly local&#13;
staff for such services. The performance of the supervision consultants would be managed and monitored&#13;
by the TMU assisted by a consultant adviser contracted for project implementation support. Local&#13;
consultants or locally established international consultants would also provide Maintenance Management&#13;
and Works Inspectorate services estimated to cost about US$2.8 million. For overseas training financed&#13;
under the project, the qualification of the candidates along with their courses of study, the proposed training&#13;
institutions and estimated costs, would be subject to prior review by the IDA.&#13;
4.14    Prior Contract Reviews. IDA financed works contracts above a threshold of US$300,000 and&#13;
goods contracts above a threshold of US$200,000 would be subject to prior review. All contracts for&#13;
consulting firms above US$100,000 and US$50,000 for individuals would also be subject to prior review&#13;
by IDA. It is estimated that this will result in more than 85% of the Credit subject to prior review for both&#13;
first and second phases of the project. This percentage is considered satisfactory given that local staff have&#13;
already been trained in IDA procurement policies and procedures and bidding documents have been&#13;
standardized for the project. Post review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels would be carried&#13;
out on about 1 in 4 works contracts.&#13;

4.15     Disbursement Categories. The IDA Credit will be disbursed against the following categories as&#13;
shown in Table IV.4.  On this basis, the estimated disbursement schedule is given in ANNEX 7.&#13;
Assurances were received that to facilitate payments from the Credit, a Special Account will be established&#13;
and will be operated and maintained on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The account will have&#13;
an initial authorized allocation of US$1.5 million, approximately equal to 4 months of expenditures under&#13;
the project. The Credit closing date would be June 30, 2003, with physical completion of works expected&#13;
by December 31, 2002.&#13;
4.16     Statement Of Expenditures (SOE): Disbursements for contracts of goods and works estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$100,000 and consultancies for firms costing less than US$100,000 equivalent and less&#13;
than US$50,000 equivalent for individuals will be made against statement of expenditures (SOE). Other&#13;
disbursements will be made against standard documentation.&#13;

4.17     Assurances were received that MLG, through the TMU, will maintain appropriate records and&#13;
accounts for expenditures under the project, including any SOEs, as well as the Special Account, in&#13;
accordance to internationally acceptable accounting standards; that such records and accounts will be&#13;
audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; and that audit reports, including a separate reports on&#13;
the SOEs, as well as the Special Account, will be provided to IDA within six months of the end of each&#13;
fiscal year.&#13;

V.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Project Implementation Plan&#13;
5.01   In order to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each entity that would participate in&#13;
implementation of the project, a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) has been prepared and agreed with&#13;
IDA. ANNEX 8 shows a summary chart of the key project implementation steps. The detailed&#13;
implementation plans for the project as a whole and specific components are included in the PIP. The&#13;
Table of Contents of the PIP is attached at ANNEX 9. Assurances were received that the project will be&#13;
implemented in accordance with the agreed PIP and substantive changes will be first agreed with IDA.&#13;
B.    Project Phases and Design Status&#13;
5.02    For most towns, the works have been divided into two phases: a first phase (covering the first 3&#13;
full years of implementation, FY97-99) and a second phase (covering remaining three years of project&#13;
implementation, FYOO-02). ANNEX 10 shows the status of selection and design of all major civil works&#13;
components.  Final detailed engineering designs for nearly all periodic rehabilitation and improvement&#13;
works included under the first phase have been substantially completed by local consultants, funded by the&#13;
PPF. Identification and design of first phase capacity improvement works in Mombasa, Eldoret and&#13;
Kisumu (about US$3.5 million equivalent) has been postponed, to be completed during project year I so as&#13;
to allow further study of needs in these towns (actual physical works to start in project year 2). Second&#13;
phase works in all towns will be agreed during the mid term review and inclusion would be subject to&#13;
towns' performance in routine maintenance during the first phase. Sub-projects under the second phase will&#13;
need to have an ERR of at least 12% to be considered eligible for IDA financing. Detailed design for the&#13;
second phase will be completed during the first phase and will be carried out by consultants, either by&#13;
those engaged for construction supervision of first phase works or through the engagement of new&#13;
consultants. Particular attention has been paid to keep the design standards appropriate and affordable and&#13;
that the investments represent least cost solutions. Detailed design review of all first phase investments was&#13;
carried out at appraisal. For second phase investments, design review will be carried out by the TMU, with&#13;
special technical assistance.&#13;
C.    Eligibility Requirements for Project Towns&#13;
5.03    It has been agreed that the project towns must demonstrate adequate routine maintenance&#13;
performance, based on an agreed Maintenance Performance Rating system, to be initially eligible for&#13;
funding under the Credit. Routine maintenance performance of the project towns is verified by independent&#13;
physical audits. A process of monthly reporting to the TMU of maintenance works performed and&#13;
quarterly physical audits of such reports by an independent engineering firm (financed by PPF) has been in&#13;
place since July 1993 and has been reinforced by independent audits since February 1994. This process&#13;
will be continued during project implementation through the maintenance management and works&#13;
inspectorate component. If a project town meets its initial eligibility requirement, it will receive full&#13;
allocation of the project budget for the first phase of investments in periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and&#13;
improvements. However, the level of allocations for periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and improvements&#13;
to any project town, during the second phase, will depend on its routine maintenance performance and other&#13;
performance indicators during the first phase, including local revenue generating and expenditure control&#13;
efforts. Project towns performing well during the first phase will be rewarded by increased allocation of&#13;
their investment budgets during the second phase, while those which fail to comply with the maintenance&#13;
requirements would be penalized by reduced allocations during the second phase. It has been agreed that,&#13;
to ensure transparency in the allocation process, the full list of all allocations would be provided to all&#13;
participating towns, through the Inter-ministerial Technical Steering Committee (ITSC). A list of eligible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
project towns which are in compliance with routine maintenance performance requirements, supported by&#13;
independent physical audit reports on their actual performance, was agreed during negotiations.&#13;
D.    Subsidiary Agreement&#13;
5.04    A Subsidiary Agreement, model included in PIP, will be entered into between the MLG (as the&#13;
project implementing agency) and each of the participating project towns, reflecting all aspects of the&#13;
project's implementation arrangements, including: (a) respective roles, responsibilities, obligations of each&#13;
of the parties; (b) an agreed prioritized candidate list of works; (c) the allocated project budget, scope of&#13;
work, schedule and method of implementation of various types of works for each project town; (d)&#13;
performance criteria on which towns will be evaluated at the mid-term review; (e) financial management,&#13;
accounting and reporting requirements; (f) financial, legal and contractual obligations of each involved&#13;
party; (g) conditions of spending project funds; (e.g., limitations on the use of routine maintenance funds&#13;
for equipment purchase); (h) an initial rating of the maintenance management capacity of each project&#13;
town; and (i) formula for adjusting normal allocations based on actual performance. It has been agreed&#13;
that signed Subsidiary Agreements with each participating project town will be a pre-requisite for receiving&#13;
IDA's approval for the award of contracts packages involving that particular project town (even when there&#13;
is more than one project town covered under a specific contract package). Signed Subsidiary Agreements&#13;
with at least six (6) project towns would be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
5.05    For contractual purposes, the project towns are identified as the "Beneficiaries", the MLG as the&#13;
"Employer:, the TMU as the "Engineer", and Construction Supervision Consultants (CSCs) as the&#13;
"Engineer's Representative".&#13;
E.    Project Management&#13;
5.06    The project will be implemented by the MLG, on behalf of and assisted by the participating&#13;
towns, with the TMU acting in the capacity of Project Manager, reporting to the Permanent Secretary,&#13;
MLG. The government will bear full financial responsibility. The specific responsibilities and functions of&#13;
the TMU are:  (i) overall project management; (ii) overseeing maintenance planning, budgeting,&#13;
management and works inspection by the project towns; (iii) design review; (iv) procurement management&#13;
and contract administration; (v) project accounting, financial management and control; (vi) information&#13;
technology and management information systems; and, (vii) general administration and facilities&#13;
management. In particular, the TMU would be directly responsible for procurement of all civil works and&#13;
equipment contracts, financed by GOK and/or IDA funds, and for engaging all engineering and technical&#13;
assistance consultants.&#13;
5.07    A project implementation structure and TMU staffing plan considered necessary for the scale&#13;
and complexity of the project is shown in ANNEX 11. It was agreed that the key positions contained in&#13;
this staffing plan will remain with qualified personnel during project implementation, either by civil&#13;
servants or contract employees.  Given the design features of the project, its objective and scope, the&#13;
capacity of the TMU will be increased by: (a) adding staff through reallocation of existing established posts&#13;
within MLG; (b) the provision of additional information technology, communications and transport under&#13;
the project; and, (c) contracting the services of engineering and technical assistance consultants. The TMU&#13;
will also undertake a comprehensive maintenance management and works inspectorate function by&#13;
employing consultants to monitor the physical quality of works implemented by the towns. A Maintenance&#13;
Management Section (MMS) within TMU will be charged with managing the consultants for this purpose.&#13;
For all works that are implemented by TMU on behalf of the towns there will be a consultative process at&#13;
planning, design and construction phases involving the towns, TMU and consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
5.08    Within the current TMU structure, many of its officers are presently performing multiple&#13;
functions as dictated by the pressures of routine work load. This is understandable and the situation is&#13;
likely to continue. However, with the start of the project, both the nature and scope of work load of TMU's&#13;
staff would increase considerably. GOK funds to the 26 project towns will be routed through the MLG and&#13;
the TMU which will be responsible for re-allocation of the funds to local authorities and for their financial&#13;
audit, in accordance with GOK requirements. It was agreed that the MLG would designate current key&#13;
officers of the TMU to take the lead responsibility in all functional areas identified above. Appointment of&#13;
staff to key positions which are currently vacant within the TMU (one deputy project manager - finance&#13;
and administration, one administrative officer, one accountant assistant, one assistant administration&#13;
officer, three accounts clerks and one computer operator) will be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
F.    Maintenance Management and Works Inspectorate Function&#13;
5.09    A central design feature of the project is to establish a fully functional maintenance management&#13;
and works inspectorate function which will be the responsibility of a Maintenance Management Section&#13;
(MMS) within the TMU and local consultants will be employed to carry out these activities on behalf of the&#13;
TMU. A basic maintenance management system has been in place since early 1993 (para. 5.03) with&#13;
towns reporting monthly on their road maintenance activities. Three physical audits have been carried out&#13;
by consultants (under the PPF) who also provided technical assistance to the towns on the operation of the&#13;
system and general aspects of routine maintenance. Local consultants will be engaged under the project to&#13;
assist the MMS to monitor the physical performance of all local authorities in receipt of GOK funding for&#13;
maintenance by means of physical audit of monthly reports (on a quarterly basis with actual timing being&#13;
randomly selected) with the objective of producing, for each local authority, a Maintenance Performance&#13;
Rating (MPR). In addition to audit, the consultants engaged under this component will provide technical&#13;
advisory services to project towns in the fields of maintenance planning and execution including the&#13;
engagement and management of small labor based contracts for routine maintenance works.&#13;
5.10    While the primary focus of this function would be to ensure the adequacy of maintenance and&#13;
quality of works (from both a physical and financial sense) for the 26 project towns, it was agreed that it&#13;
would be appropriate for the TMU to extend this form of "quality control" to all other local authorities,&#13;
including those outside the scope of the project, who will also receive funding from the GOK (in addition to&#13;
the $40.0 million for the project), so as to apply the same maintenance management/works execution&#13;
principles and discipline being adopted under the project to all of TMU's activities in this area nationally.&#13;
It. was therefore agreed to finance some of the incremental operating cost for this purpose under the project.&#13;
The draft Terms of Reference, with detailed operational guidelines for audit and for computation of the&#13;
Maintenance Performance rating, and a sample consultancy contract for the maintenance management and&#13;
works inspectorate function has been agreed with the TMU.&#13;
G.    Construction Program and Contracting&#13;
5.11    Consultants will be engaged by the MLG for supervision of construction by contractors (termed&#13;
Construction Supervision Consultants - CSC), reporting to the TMU. Works contracted by TMU&#13;
(Engineer) will be supervised by the CSCs (as the Engineer's Representative). It has been agreed that there&#13;
will be six (6) CSCs for supervision of all construction works under the first phase, distributed on a&#13;
regional basis (an exception will be the first phase periodic maintenance contracts in Nairobi which will be&#13;
supervised by Nairobi City Council as Engineer's Representative). ANNEX 2 shows the groups of project&#13;
towns per CSC. The draft Terms of Reference, with specific scope of work for each of the six CSCs, and&#13;
a sample consultancy contract for such services have been agreed with the TMU.&#13;
5.12    Similar arrangements will apply during the second phase of the project as well. One of the&#13;
key project objectives is the gradual devolution of implementation responsibility to towns as they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
demonstrate their capacity for and commitment to the maintenance of their road networks. Towns&#13;
demonstrating good performance in terms of quantity, quality and planning may be delegated&#13;
responsibility for administering funds for periodic maintenance and rehabilitation works  Depending&#13;
on the performance and demonstrated capacity to effectively carry out routine maintenance during the&#13;
first phase, the respective roles of the TMU, the project towns and the CSCs may be altered during the&#13;
second phase to give the project towns either more or less direct works supervision and management&#13;
responsibility.  The respective functions of the various parties and their possible adjustments are&#13;
explained in ANNEX 12.&#13;
5.13    The majority of civil works will be executed by contract. All periodic maintenance, rehabilitation&#13;
and improvement works will be contracted under ICB procedures. The Nairobi traffic management&#13;
component includes procurement of traffic signals and associated equipment. Civil works needed for&#13;
installation will be executed as a part of rehabilitation or improvement contracts. Routine maintenance&#13;
works will be executed by a mixture of contract and direct labor. During the first phase, only some routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance works will be executed directly by the towns. It is expected that towns will use&#13;
their existing direct labor resources (staff and equipment) to the extent possible, however, where works&#13;
exceed the capacity of existing organizations, towns will be encouraged to contract out works rather than&#13;
engaging more staff and/or purchasing equipment. In the case of small towns who have, at the start of the&#13;
project, insufficient capacity to execute routine maintenance works or who have proved, under Maintenance&#13;
Management Section's (MMS) monitoring process, to have a low performance rating, such works will be&#13;
contracted directly by MLG.&#13;
5.14   It has been agreed, and will be so reflected in the Subsidiary Agreement with the towns, that each&#13;
project town will be required to contract out a minimum of 30% of routine maintenance, funded by GOK,&#13;
annually (i.e., up to 70% of routine maintenance works may be carried out by using force account by the&#13;
project towns), and that they will be prohibited from using such funds to purchase major equipment or for&#13;
payment of salaries. Where GOK funds are directly utilize by TMU on behalf of the town (there are a few&#13;
very small towns who do not yet have even the minimum capacity to undertake routine maintenance works),&#13;
works will always be contracted. It has also been agreed that the periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement works will be contracted out.&#13;
H.    Other Capacity Building Inputs&#13;
5.15    Specialist technical assistance, internationally recruited, will be brought in at various points in&#13;
time during the first three years of the project, to assist the TMU and the project towns (where&#13;
appropriate), in the following areas: (a) maintenance planning, programming and budgeting systems and&#13;
procedures; (b) technical road rehabilitation and improvement design standards and design review&#13;
guidelines; and (c) procurement management and contracts administrations systems and procedures. Draft&#13;
Terns of Reference and sample consultancy contract document have been agreed with MLG.&#13;
5.16    Technical assistance would also be provided for: (a) improved traffic management and&#13;
coordination and road safety improvements in Nairobi; (b) mapping; and (c) studies of long-term land use&#13;
and transport demand management in Nairobi. Draft Terms of References for the above technical&#13;
assistance and sample consultancy contract documents have been agreed with MLG. In addition, a study&#13;
of appropriate long-term road infrastructure investments in Mombasa will be undertaken in the context of&#13;
unique drainage problems facing the town. Given the significance of these two studies to the long term&#13;
needs of the sub-sector in Nairobi and Mombasa, detailed Terms of References were agreed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
5.17    MLG would directly oversee a program of training and staff development for selected TMU and&#13;
local authorities staff. Technical staff in project towns would receive training both locally and overseas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Workshops and seminars would be organized to educate personnel in project towns and to reinforce the&#13;
sense of project ownership. A detailed program of staff training and development has been agreed with&#13;
MLG.&#13;
I.    Future Project Preparation Support&#13;
5.18   The precise nature of consultant assistance, studies and pilot programs for preparing a future&#13;
municipal investment program will be decided during the mid term review of the project. Specifics of these&#13;
tasks and activities will first need to be agreed with IDA before any good or services are financed under the&#13;
Credit for this purpose.&#13;
J.    Financial Arrangements&#13;
5.19    GOK contribution to the project, totaling US$40 million equivalent, will be provided to the&#13;
project towns through MLG. These funds will be used to finance 100% routine maintenance expenditures,&#13;
50% of the total costs of the maintenance management and works inspectorate functions (20% for the first&#13;
phase and 80% for the second phase). The balance of GOK contributions will be used to finance the&#13;
government's share of the periodic maintenance costs, as well as duties and taxes under the project.&#13;
Assurances were received during negotiations that GOK will make available its annual counterpart&#13;
contributions to the MLG in equal quarterly installments in advance; and that MLG would in turn allocate&#13;
such funds to the project towns, primarily for routine maintenance, largely based on population, also on a&#13;
quarterly basis. TMU will maintain appropriate accounting records and statements showing receipts, from&#13;
GOK, and disbursements of such funds by MLG.&#13;
5.20    Assurances were received during negotiations that GOK will make available to the MLG for the&#13;
project the following annual amounts (totaling US$40.0 million equivalent): FY95/96 - US$4.0 million&#13;
equivalent, FY96/97 and FY97/98 - US$7.0 million equivalent per year, FY98/99 - US$8.0 million&#13;
equivalent, FY90/00 and FYOO/01 - US$7.0 million equivalent, to be received by MLG in equal quarterly&#13;
amounts. Assurances were obtained that MLG will provide IDA with a quarterly analytical statement&#13;
showing amounts received by MLG from GOK, amounts disbursed to the project towns for routine&#13;
maintenance expenditures and for other project related activities. An initial deposit of US$1.67 million&#13;
equivalent towards FY95/96 contribution into the project account by GOK will be a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
K.    Local Authority Participation&#13;
5.21    The existing Inter-ministerial Urban Transport Policy Coordination Committee (UTPC) and the&#13;
Inter-ministerial Technical Steering Committee (ITSC) will continue to play their roles in project&#13;
implementation. Under the ITSC, subcommittees, grouping together project towns on size and regional&#13;
basis, have been formed. These sub-committees meet to discuss technical aspects of the project and prepare&#13;
recommendations to the parent ITSC committee. They will continue to meet during the project&#13;
implementation, providing a forum for local authorities to discuss and highlight issues affecting the&#13;
execution of the project, which is important to preserve the sense of project ownership.&#13;
5.22    The local authorities will also be involved in: (i) preparing annual maintenance plans which have&#13;
to be approved by their councils; (ii) signing-off on the list of works which will include the first phase&#13;
works; (iii) undertaking routine maintenance (by those project towns who have been assessed to have&#13;
adequate capacity); (iv) receiving engineers/town clerks reports on the monthly site-meetings which they&#13;
will have attended; (v) approving the contractor's workplans, in regards to required traffic management&#13;
measures, so as to provide the public notices needed for the necessary diversions where a section of road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
would be closed; and (vi) final inspection and issuance of defect liability certificates, since, over time, the&#13;
completed roads would be handed over to the councils for on-going maintenance.&#13;
L.    Progress Reporting, Annual and Mid-term Review&#13;
5.23    The PIP includes an agreed format of quarterly progress report, which IDA should receive from&#13;
the MLG, on implementation progress of the project. This report will include, inter alia, status of key&#13;
project activities -- covering all aspects of the project. It has been agreed that MLG will provide IDA with&#13;
quarterly progress reports based on agreed format and content.&#13;
5.24    Estimated IDA supervision inputs are shown in ANNEX 13. In addition to regular IDA&#13;
supervision, the on-going review and reporting by the MMS and review of the CSCs performance by the&#13;
TMU, an annual report of routine maintenance performance by individual local authorities will be prepared&#13;
by MLG (through TMU). TMU would propose to MLG and IDA any remedial actions which might be&#13;
taken to ensure improved routine maintenance performance. It has been agreed that the TMU will provide&#13;
IDA with an annual report on routine maintenance performance by project towns.&#13;
5.25   Assurances were obtained during negotiations that a comprehensive mid-term review of overall&#13;
implementation performance by the TMU and the project towns, with particular attention to routine&#13;
maintenance performance, during years 1-3 of the project (first phase) will take place around March 1999&#13;
using the following criteria: (i) quantitative and qualitative use of routine maintenance funds received by&#13;
project towns; (ii) actual physical outputs as compared to targets; (iii) efficiency of awarding/managing&#13;
routine maintenance contracts; (iv) planning and prioritization of maintenance tasks; and (v) initiative for&#13;
local revenue generation. Allocation of the total project budget for the second phase to individual project&#13;
towns will be agreed with IDA during the mid-term review. Additionally, ANNEX 14 summarizes some of&#13;
the key performance and impact indicators which will be applied in measuring quality of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;

VI.   PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A.    Benefits and Beneficiaries&#13;
6.01   The main project benefits would accrue to the Kenyan economy as a whole. The quantified&#13;
benefits, used in the economic analyses, were road user cost savings for periodic maintenance, road&#13;
rehabilitation and road improvements. However, in the case of major capacity improvement works in&#13;
Nairobi, time savings of road users, including passengers, provide the main source of quantifiable benefits.&#13;
Unquantified benefits would also accrue as a result of reduced traffic congestion (less air and noise&#13;
pollution), better traffic management (less vehicle accidents and increased safety for bicycles and&#13;
pedestrians), street lighting maintenance and improvements (better security), improvement of bus stations&#13;
and footpath/bicycle-path improvements (better service and increased traffic safety). Indirect benefits&#13;
would result from improved access to the workplace and to living areas of the poor (only partially&#13;
quantified by the economic value of time-savings) and improved drainage (facilitating malaria control).&#13;
The impact of institutional strengthening, dissemination of the technical expertise and improved&#13;
management procedures could benefit planning and execution of similar improvements throughout the&#13;
country. Finally, the project would support and improve capacity of the local authorities to better manage&#13;
their service delivery and development programs.&#13;
6.02    The primary direct beneficiaries would be motorized road users and the non-motorized road&#13;
users (pedestrians and cyclists, among whom are numbered predominantly lower income groups, including&#13;
the urban poor). Among the former, less directly, would be the passengers using public transport (again,&#13;
substantial numbers of poor). Analysis of traffic data, for roads included in the first phase rehabilitation&#13;
and periodic maintenance works, showed that around 75% of passenger trips were by bus or light goods&#13;
vehicles and only 25% by car. Improved roads will lead to improved bus services. In addition, a number&#13;
of road improvements are specifically targeted at the provision of better access to and from bus transport&#13;
for low income housing estates.&#13;
B.    Economic Analysis&#13;
6.03    ANNEX 15 shows the economic analysis for the first phase investments, yielding an overall&#13;
ERR of about 41% for all towns with respect to the periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and capacity&#13;
improvement projects. The calculations used road user costs savings to represent the quantified benefits,&#13;
expressed in terms of constant prices. The analyses used a simplified model, derived from HDM-III&#13;
(reflecting least total cost solutions considering a discounted stream of benefits and costs to include&#13;
investment, maintenance and user costs), and compared 20-year project costs, including those of&#13;
subsequent routine and periodic maintenance, against a minimum maintenance scenario. The analyses thus&#13;
consider the future benefits from the institutionalization of adequate capacity and funding for road&#13;
maintenance and not just the immediate benefits from the project funded civil works. The analyses yielded&#13;
an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) ranging from under 10% (improvement of roads serving low income&#13;
areas in small towns) to over 100% (rehabilitation of high volume roads in the larger towns). It was not&#13;
possible to quantify benefits for some civil works using traditional techniques; these included footpath&#13;
construction independent of road works and improvement of bus stations. The works for which benefits&#13;
were quantified comprised about 80% of the first phase investments (or about 48% total civil works under&#13;
the project). Under base value assumptions (see ANNEX 15), periodic maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
investments yielded an ERR of about 55% and capacity improvement projects yielded an ERR of about&#13;
28%.&#13;
6.04    Sensitivity analysis was also carried out for rehabilitation and capacity improvement projects&#13;
separately. The impact on ERR through changes in key cost and benefit parameters are indicated in Table&#13;
5 and 6 of ANNEX 15 for periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and capacity improvement projects,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
respectively. Under the worst case scenario (construction costs increase by 20% and overall benefits are&#13;
reduced by over 20%), the ERRs for periodic maintenance and rehabilitation projects decline from 55%&#13;
under base case consumptions to about 30% and the ERR for capacity improvement projects decline from&#13;
28% to about 4%; with an overall ERR for the first phase investments declining from 41% to about 18%.&#13;
6.05    For investments in routine maintenance, economic evaluation was carried out on the basis of&#13;
benefit to cost relationship and is indicated in Table 8 of ANNEX 15. The weighted average benefit cost&#13;
ratio on an annual basis is around 9.9 under base value assumptions. This ratio is very sensitive to&#13;
assumption of proportion of roads maintained with high traffic volumes. If the proportion of high traffic&#13;
volume roads was reduced by 50% in the routine maintenance program, the benefit cost ratio would fall to&#13;
about 6. 1.&#13;
C.    Impact on the Poor&#13;
6.06    Kenya has a high overall population growth rate (2.7% p.a. over recent years) which cannot be&#13;
sustained by increased agricultural production in rural areas. Hence the growth in urban population has&#13;
been higher than the national average with a consequent rise in urban low income groups (estimated at 30%&#13;
of the urban population or 1.25 million people) and urban unemployment (estimated at 23% of the urban&#13;
population). Improving the efficiency of the urban transport in Kenya would promote the development and&#13;
efficiency of the urban manufacturing and service sectors and thus indirectly benefit the urban poor. A&#13;
major consideration in project design has been to include specific selection and design criteria for sub-&#13;
projects which explicitly recognize the needs of the poor (such as proximity to low income areas, roads&#13;
heavily used by the poor, the need for pedestrian facilities etc.).&#13;
6.07    Direct impact on low income groups will be through road improvements and the improvement of&#13;
pedestrian and cycle facilities. Footpath construction, improvement and maintenance is an integral part of&#13;
the civil works program in all towns (around 15% of construction costs or US$15 million) and the SSATP&#13;
pilot projects will additionally promote better footpaths in low income areas and the increased use of&#13;
bicycles in four towns. Street lighting is of increasing concern to urban residents for reasons of personal&#13;
security and this is being addressed under the project. In the first phase, the emphasis will be on&#13;
encouraging towns to repair/maintain existing lighting which, in many instances, is largely non-functional&#13;
due to lack of maintenance funds and theft of lighting units. Where towns show a capability to maintain&#13;
their street lights during the first years of the project, funds will be included for new lighting during the&#13;
second phase.&#13;
6.08    Many of the civil works are labor-intensive and will provide employment for unskilled workers.&#13;
While, in the case of rehabilitation and improvement works, such employment is for a limited period in the&#13;
case of maintenance operations the works will be continuing beyond the life of the project. It is estimated&#13;
that an annual average expenditure of US$4 million on routine maintenance in the project towns will&#13;
provide additional permanent employment for between 3,000 and 5,000 in the local construction industry&#13;
involved in road maintenance in Kenya.&#13;
6.09    TMU is responsible for providing support for local road maintenance and improvement activities&#13;
in some 140 rural and urban local authorities, in addition to the project towns. Project support for the&#13;
MMS and the maintenance management and works inpectorate function globally will contribute towards&#13;
improved maintenance management of rural access roads and thus supplement other efforts aimed at relief&#13;
of rural poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31 -&#13;
D.    Road Safety&#13;
6.10   The project would provide technical assistance for strengthening the institutional framework and&#13;
financing for physical investments directed at targeted "black spot" programs in Nairobi and the other&#13;
major towns, aimed at providing safer environment for pedestrians, most of whom are the poor. The road&#13;
safety situation in Kenya, particularly in some of the larger towns, gives rise to significant concem. The&#13;
number of reported accidents increased at the rate of 6.8% p.a. throughout the 1980's, twice the population&#13;
growth rate and two-and-a half times the rate of motor vehicle fleet growth rate. In recent years about 60%&#13;
of all personal injury accidents are estimated to occur in Nairobi alone. Most of these accidents involve&#13;
pedestrians. Human costs of traffic casualties and traffic-related losses are difficult to quantify, but are&#13;
significant. Through the efforts of bilateral donors, such as the Finnish government assistance to the&#13;
National Road Safety Council, some priority safety interventions and the necessary institutional&#13;
arrangements for improving road safety have been identified. As a part of the traffic management&#13;
component and the non-motorized investments, the project would also support road safety improvement,&#13;
particularly in Nairobi.&#13;
E.    Environmental Impact&#13;
6.11    The project is a category B project and would not have any significant adverse environmental&#13;
impacts. All maintenance, rehabilitation and improvement works under the project affect existing roads&#13;
and do not involve any land acquisition or permanent resettlement of people. The major capacity&#13;
improvements in Nairobi (dualling and improved junctions) have been designed to utilize only the existing&#13;
right-of-way.  Some tree felling will be needed but replanting has been included in the construction&#13;
contracts. For the most part, environmental effects of the project will be positive. The most significant&#13;
would be the expected reduction in the rate of growth of urban traffic accidents (between vehicles and&#13;
involving cyclists and pedestrians). Decreased air and noise pollution, from exhaust fumes, dust off&#13;
unsealed roads and congestion, improved drainage and better street lighting, would positively contribute to&#13;
an improved urban environment.&#13;
6.12    Clauses have been included in civil works contracts regarding landscape preservation, prevention&#13;
of water pollution, abatement of water pollution, dust abatement (during work and materials transport&#13;
operations), use of pesticides, disposal of waste materials, construction site sanitation and safety, traffic&#13;
safety and signing, as well as fire prevention. Correctly applied and enforced, these clauses will ensure that&#13;
construction and maintenance works cause minimal impact on people living on or near the project roads.&#13;
ANNEX 16 includes an "Environmental Mitigation Plan" as agreed with the government.&#13;
F.    Project Risks and Sustainability&#13;
6.13    The main potential risks are: (i) inadequate maintenance discipline by the project towns and the&#13;
MLG and the failure of the local authorities to continue to maintain the network efficiently; (ii) insufficient&#13;
and uncertain funding from GOK for sustained maintenance of the urban road network; (iii) failure by local&#13;
authorities to provide funding priority for basic maintenance over new works or expensive rehabilitation&#13;
and by the GOK to pursue and enforce such policy; (iv) failure to adequately improve the management and&#13;
technical capacity of the MLG to effectively manage an investment program covering a large number of&#13;
towns and (v) delay in implementing the necessary reforms under the municipal reform program which are&#13;
required to improve the resource base and financial and operational capabilities of the local authorities for&#13;
sustaining the investments.&#13;
6.14    These potential risks have been considered during the inception and design of the project. The&#13;
Letter of Sectoral Policy on municipal reform and the government's commitment to ensure adequate&#13;
resources for routine and periodic road maintenance provide strong foundations for this project.  In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
addition, the institutional support component of the project and the agreed implementation arrangements are&#13;
both designed to help manage these risks. Institutional risks would be mitigated through the implementation&#13;
of a capacity strengthening program to enhance staff skills in maintenance management as well as other key&#13;
areas such as procurement and contract management as well as transport planning and management. It&#13;
would be unrealistic to expect that equal progress can be made with all local authorities, in strengthening&#13;
their capabilities or enlisting support and commitment. Initial eligibility requirement for the project towns&#13;
based on past maintenance performance and "phasing" of project funds linking prior maintenance&#13;
performance to subsequent allocation of funds to a particular project town are designed to sustain&#13;
maintenance discipline and provide incentive for continued good maintenance performance. To ensure that&#13;
the project is consistent with sector goals and policies, the project's development objectives would be&#13;
pursued through continued dialog with the government on ongoing sector reform efforts and, over the long&#13;
term, through support for the Municipal Reform Program.&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 1 of 9&#13;
LETTER OF SECTORAL POLICY&#13;
.      Statement of Purpose&#13;
Recent macroeconomic and urbanization trends in Kenya necessitate major changes in the current&#13;
system for financing and operating the public services required for continued economic growth. Infra-&#13;
structure development has not kept pace with the country's needs during the 1990s, largely due to a number&#13;
of fiscal and institutional constraints that have emerged during the period when service demands have&#13;
rapidly escalated.&#13;
Government has developed a dual strategy for bringing about reforms required to correct the&#13;
present situation. The first component of the strategy is to introduce action-oriented construction, operation&#13;
and maintenance programs for key infrastructure sectors that are vital for economic development. This&#13;
approach is being initially implemented for the transportation sector through the Urban Transport&#13;
Infrastructure Project. The second component is to develop a broader program of major intergovernmental&#13;
fiscal and institutional reform, which Government plans to do through the Municipal Reform Programme.&#13;
While Government believes tangible progress can and will be demonstrated through the sectoral approach,&#13;
it also recognizes that the sustainability of reforms realized in the transport sector and the success of future&#13;
attempts to extend similar reforms to other key infrastructure sectors critically depend on the systematic&#13;
implementation of broader fiscal and institutional reforms. This letter of Sectoral Policy briefly outlines the&#13;
most pressing reform requirements and Government's intentions for meeting them.&#13;
2.     Background&#13;
Although the urban development/local government sector in Kenya has historically been quite&#13;
successful, a variety of difficulties and constraints have emerged in recent years. Many local authorities&#13;
consistently run deficits and are heavily in debt they are unable to repay. Access to capital is increasingly&#13;
limited, investment in and maintenance of infrastructure are inadequate, and many services are provided at&#13;
substandard quality levels.&#13;
The various types of local authorities suffer in different ways. Older, more established municipal&#13;
councils are unable to deliver major services adequately and to replace deteriorating infrastructure. Newer&#13;
municipal and town councils are faced with finding a way to provide basic infrastructure without the&#13;
massive infusion of Government grants that benefited the older urban areas. Many councils have inelastic&#13;
sources of revenue and large employee rolls which take upto 70% of annual income. The consequences of&#13;
this situation go well beyond the obvious local service shortfalls. As local authorities are part of an&#13;
integrated system of national and local institutions that should be working together in pursuit of common&#13;
objectives, the inability of the councils to meet their share of development responsibilities undermines&#13;
national economic growth. In particular, the heavy dependence of local authorities on Government to&#13;
finance infrastructure investment is not sustainable given the present state of the economy and concurrent&#13;
pressure for central fiscal reform by donors and multilateral agencies. The situation is further complicated&#13;
because demand for public service is increasing rapidly with population growth.&#13;
As the national fiscal constraints that prevent sectoral ministries from dealing with the growing&#13;
infrastructure shortfall become increasingly binding, the ability of the local authorities to manage capital&#13;
investments and services operation more responsibly becomes increasingly critical for the continued&#13;
success of the Kenyan economy. Recognizing this reality, Government has determined that it is essential to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
implement major changes in the intergovernmental fiscal system to complement the extensive programme&#13;
of macroeconomic reform and structural adjustment that has already been undertaken in recent years.&#13;
3.     The Present Situation&#13;
Government recognizes six key areas in the urban development/local government sector that&#13;
require reform.&#13;
(a)    Intergovernmental Relations&#13;
The Ministry of Local Government (MLG), which is responsible for overseeing the system of local&#13;
government, is highly centralized. It has traditionally focused more on regulating and controlling&#13;
local authorities than assisting them technically or financially. This situation, which results from&#13;
the narrow historical interpretation of the Local Government Act, is no longer appropriate given&#13;
recent economic, administrative and political developments. Several considerations are particularly&#13;
relevant in this regard. First, as democratization and citizen participation emerge as priorities, the&#13;
development of genuine accountability of local leaders to their constituencies is required. Under&#13;
the present system, local councillors and officers can easily blame poor performance on Central&#13;
Government interference, even when this is not the case. Second MLG has not received the&#13;
resources required to adapt to the rapid increase in the number of local authorities during the past&#13;
decade. The lack of better developed MLG information base and technical capacity results in: (i)&#13;
the creation and upgrading of local authorities that cannot handle basic responsibilities; (ii) highly&#13;
uneven patterns of revenue generation and service delivery across local authorities; and (iii) long&#13;
delays in making decisions on local authority requests. Third, lack of technical assistance from&#13;
MLG is a major obstacle for weaker local authorities, who have little hope of functioning&#13;
effectively without such support. MLG's technical assistance capacity has improved in recent years&#13;
with the creation of the Urban Development Department (UDD) and the Finance, Legal and&#13;
Administration Department (FLAD), but it remains too limited to meet ever-increasing require-&#13;
ments. Fourth, central-local fiscal relations during the past two decades have developed in a&#13;
piecemeal manner rather than under a unified vision of what the fiscal roles of central and local&#13;
governments should be. As a result: (i) several key sources of local revenue duplicate existing&#13;
government sources; (ii) local authorities are deprived of substantial revenues because Government&#13;
agencies rarely remit the full value of what they owe in the form of payments in lieu of land rates,&#13;
local authority service charges and user fees; and (iii) the lack of an intergovernmental grant&#13;
system, which was largely phased out in the 1970s, creates a situation in which poor local&#13;
authorities do not have access to adequate financial resources and the MLG has limited ability to&#13;
influence local authority behaviour with positive incentives.&#13;
(b)    Financing Local Infrastructure Investment&#13;
Loan funds for local infrastructure development have become more scarce in recent years largely&#13;
because of a deteriorating system for financing local investment. The majority of funding has&#13;
historically come from donor loans channelled by Treasury to the councils through the Local&#13;
Government Loan Authority (LGLA), a parastatal under direct MLG control. A substantial portion&#13;
of these loans has not been repaid by local authorities, but must nevertheless be repaid to foreign&#13;
lenders by Treasury. This situation places a significant strain on Government at a time when there&#13;
is severe donor pressure for budget rationalization, including improvement of public investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
quality and reduction of debt service. While part of the responsibility clearly rests with local&#13;
authorities, Government and its parastatals contributes to the inability of the councils to repay loans&#13;
by frequently failing to remit what they owe, as discussed above. Equally important, LGLA has not&#13;
enforced local authority loan repayment and Treasury has not pressured LGLA to do so.&#13;
(c)    Infrastructure Maintenance and Operations&#13;
It has been well documented that resources devoted to the operations and maintenance of basic&#13;
infrastructure development in Kenya are well below what is required to meet current needs. New&#13;
infrastructure development is proceeding slowly, maintenance of existing facilities is deteriorating,&#13;
and basic services are not available to many people, especially the poor. In the case of the transport&#13;
sector, road maintenance and improvements have not been given a high priority at either the&#13;
national or local level in recent years, with overall expenditures on roads falling steadily as a&#13;
percentage of total expenditures throughout the 1980s. Given the difficult national budgetary&#13;
situation, Government is not in a position to shoulder the full burden of responsibility for urban&#13;
transport. Local authority resources raised for transportation purposes, however have been very&#13;
minor to date, and local authority planning and engineering capacity has not been well developed.&#13;
(d)    Recurrent Revenue Collection&#13;
Although local authorities in Kenya have substantial sources of revenue relative to many&#13;
developing countries, councils have not historically been granted uniform access to all relevant&#13;
local revenue bases by MLG, and local authorities have not fully mobilized the resources made&#13;
available to them. Most allowable revenue bases are not fully assessed, and revenue rates are set&#13;
too low to cover required expenditures, even in the case of cost-recoverable services for which&#13;
direct user fees are charged. Moreover, the buoyancy of revenue yields is poor because of the way&#13;
rates are set and revised and collection procedures are limited and not well enforced. Although the&#13;
present situation derives from weak management at the local authority level, Government action (or&#13;
inaction) is also well known to affect the ability of local authorities to raise revenues. Key&#13;
examples include: (i) the inability of the Ministry of Lands to handle the enormous burden of&#13;
revaluing land in a timely manner; (ii) long delays in Attorney General and MLG approval of the&#13;
local by-laws required for local authorities to collect their allowable revenues; and (iii) the&#13;
underdevelopment of adequate local government revenue collection enforcement capacity.&#13;
(e)    Management Systems&#13;
Local authority accounting methods currently in use are cumbersome and difficult for most&#13;
councils to use. Inaccurate and poorly organized basic records on council financial transactions&#13;
lead to unnecessarily weak revenue and expenditure management and control, and make it very&#13;
difficult to plan for future needs and prepare meaningful forward budgets. In addition, most&#13;
councils have limited internal auditing, and the internal auditor is under the control of the treasurer,&#13;
who has overall responsibility for the council's funds.&#13;
(f)    Staffing and Training&#13;
It is well documented that both under-and-over-staffing occur in local authorities, and vacancy rates&#13;
are very high for skilled staff. Basic local authority personnel regulations and job definitions are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
lacking, and the absence of an employee evaluation, disciplinary and incentive system undernines&#13;
performance. Inadequate attention is also given to planning and organizing training activities in&#13;
many local authorities and at the MLG, largely due to lack of resources at both levels. At the same&#13;
time, there are insufficient training facilities and programs for local authority officers and council-&#13;
lors.&#13;
4.     Reforms of the Present System&#13;
Government recognizes that the local service delivery and finance system requires comprehensive&#13;
reform. As noted above, a dual-component strategy has been designed for bringing about these reforms.&#13;
The first task is to introduce construction, operation and maintenance programs for key infrastructure&#13;
sectors that are vital for economic development, starting with the transportation sector through the Urban&#13;
Transport Infrastructure Project. The second step is to develop a broader supporting program of major&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal and institutional reform with the assistance of the Municipal Reform Programme.&#13;
The sustainability of reforms realized in the transport sector and the success of future attempts to extend&#13;
similar reforms to other infrastructure sectors depend on the systematic implementation of broader fiscal&#13;
and institutional reforms. Thus, the two new project/programmes are highly interrelated.&#13;
5.     Infrastructural Provision: The Urban Transport Project&#13;
Government is committed to improving the present mechanisms for financing, constructing,&#13;
maintaining and operating basic infrastructure. As a starting point, the Urban Transport Infrastructure&#13;
Project will undertake four key reforms for the transport sector.&#13;
(a)    Increase Financial Resources for Construction and Maintenance&#13;
The Urban Transport Infrastructure Project will make investment finance available to participating&#13;
local authorities that meet certain fiscal and technical conditions. In addition, efforts are also&#13;
underway to reform the LGLA in order to ensure that adequate capital will be available for&#13;
infrastructure investment in the future. On the recurrent budget side, Government has already&#13;
instituted a Road Maintenance Levy Fund, part of which will be dedicated to local authority road&#13;
expenditures, and there are also plans to develop incentives for local authorities to increase the&#13;
volume of resources they raise internally for road maintenance. (Kenya: Macroeconomic and&#13;
Structural Policy Framework for 1995 - 97 par. 49).&#13;
(b)    Enhance Capacity and Improve Deployment of Technical Staff&#13;
Planning and engineering staff involved in the design, operation and maintenance of road systems&#13;
and traffic management and coordination will be given better training and more efficiently&#13;
deployed. In addition, periodic workshops and seminars will be organized to update local&#13;
authorities on new developments and to provide a forum in which they can exchange information&#13;
and experiences related to the transport sector.&#13;
(c)    Procedural Development and Performance Incentives&#13;
Systems for monitoring road condition, scheduling regular maintenance activities and dealing with&#13;
emergency situations will be developed to ensure that local authority road systems are operating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
efficiently and are well coordinated with Government activities in this sector. Incentives will also&#13;
be introduced through the project to improve local authority performance in these critical tasks.&#13;
(d)    Encourage Contracting of Road Maintenance&#13;
Road Maintenance provides the opportunity for increased private sector participation because the&#13;
tasks can be concretely defined and contractor performance in meeting their obligations can be&#13;
directly monitored. In order for expected efficiency gains to be realized, a system will be&#13;
developed for ensuring that bids for road maintenance contracts are competitive and for building&#13;
the capacity of local authority managers to monitor and oversee these contracts.&#13;
6.     Institutional and Fiscal Reform: The Kenya Municipal Reform Programme&#13;
Five key reform areas have been targeted for the Municipal Reform Programme by Government to&#13;
complement the objectives of the Urban Transport Infrastructure Project, ensure its sustainability, and lay&#13;
the foundation for extending similar reforms to other key infrastructure sectors.&#13;
(a)    Reform Intergovernmental Relations&#13;
The Local Government Act will be significantly reformed to reduce unnecessary control over local&#13;
authority activities, and generally decentralize routine MLG activities to provincial/district levels.&#13;
Efforts are already underway to implement the changes in the legal framework along the lines&#13;
recommended in May 1994 by a Workshop organized specifically to advise on this matter. MLG&#13;
has begun the process of internal decentralization, most notably with the devolution of the annual&#13;
local authority budget review process to the provincial level. Over time, MLG intends to adapt to&#13;
changing fiscal and administrative conditions by transforming its principal role from control and&#13;
regulation to technical assistance and performance enhancement. Although local authorities will&#13;
continue to require some supervision until their internal capacity to meet their responsibilities is&#13;
proven, councils that meet certain standards will be rewarded for good performance by being&#13;
granted more fiscal autonomy and a greater access to loans for infrastructure development. The&#13;
councils with poor performance will be targeted for higher levels of technical assistance by MLG.&#13;
In order for such differentiation among local authorities to occur, a system for evaluating local&#13;
capacity and performance will be developed. Information collected for development of this system&#13;
will also allow MLG to develop broader standards and guidelines for (i) creating and upgrading&#13;
local authorities; (ii) assigning service responsibilities and measuring services delivery perform-&#13;
ance; and (iii) assigning sources of revenue and setting revenue collection targets.&#13;
With respect to intergovernmental fiscal relations, Government will take steps to ensure that all&#13;
payments owed by central agencies to the local authorities will be made in a timely manner, in&#13;
addition, consideration will be given to the re-establishment of a system of transfers to local&#13;
authorities. These steps will be undertaken in the broader context of harmonizing central and local&#13;
sources of revenue in a more efficient and equitable system of public resource mobilization and&#13;
service delivery. (IDA Aide Memoire on KMRP of November 1994).&#13;
(b)    Improved Local Access to and Use of Capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
Three steps will be taken by Government to deal with the local infrastructure investment crises.&#13;
First, the mutual debt situation will be better documented, and it is Government's intention to&#13;
resolve it in a fair and pragmatic way. Second, fiscal responsibility among local authorities,&#13;
Government and parastatals will be enhanced. This means that local authorities will be required to&#13;
repay loans they take from Government agencies and that Government agencies will meet their&#13;
liabilities to local authorities. Third, the LGLA will be significantly restructured to more efficiently&#13;
use funds and to introduce fiscal discipline into the system in a formal and binding way. Broader&#13;
institutional and procedural reforms, as detailed elsewhere in this sectoral letter, will be introduced&#13;
to ensure continued intergovernmental fiscal responsibility.&#13;
(c)    Continue Enhancement of Local Revenue Generation Capacity&#13;
Government is undertaking three key measures to enhance local authority revenue generation.&#13;
First, powers to raise revenue from appropriate sources sufficient to cover service responsibilities&#13;
will be extended to all local authorities. This process has already begun in recent years with the&#13;
reform of agricultural cess and the introduction of the local authority service charge. Second,&#13;
Government intends to help local authorities develop adequate collection mechanisms as part of the&#13;
broader program of managerial reforms discussed below. Third, work will be undertaken to&#13;
determine legal and administrative actions that should be taken at the central level to improve local&#13;
revenue collection enforcement authority.&#13;
(d)    Reform Local Authority Management Systems&#13;
Three broad reforms are planned to enhance local authority Management. First, Government will&#13;
institute guidelines for local authority department and committee organization, which has already&#13;
been done for the councils participating in the GTZ Small Towns Development Programme.&#13;
Second, standardized and simplified accounting and record-keeping systems will be developed.&#13;
Third, better procedures for budgeting, cashflow management, revenue and expenditure control,&#13;
and internal auditing will be designed to improve the use of local resources.&#13;
(e)    Enhance Local Authority Staffing and Training&#13;
Reforms in four aspects of local authority employment policy and procedures are anticipated. First,&#13;
Government will generate new local authority employment regulations and guidelines to enable&#13;
more rational staffing and personnel management. Second, a system of employee evaluation and&#13;
incentives will be introduced to enhance employee performance. Third, Government will intensify&#13;
its efforts to train local authority staff at all levels through establishment of innovative training&#13;
programs. Fourth, Government will explore ways of introducing the public sector retrenchment&#13;
programme to the local government sector.&#13;

7.     Summary&#13;
Given the importance of local authorities in service provision and revenue generation and the&#13;
inability of central agencies to assume responsibility of rapidly increasing service needs, Government&#13;
recognizes that local authority reform has become a critical development issue for Kenya. Through the&#13;
Urban Transport Infrastructure Project as a prototype for all key infrastructure sectors, reforms will be&#13;
instituted to: increase resources available for construction and maintenance of facilities; enhance the&#13;
technical capacity of local authority planning and engineering staff; develop procedures to ensure better&#13;
operation and maintenance of the road system; and encourage the contracting of private firms for certain&#13;
types of activities.&#13;
Recognizing that infrastructure reforms are not sustainable without broader fiscal, managerial and&#13;
institutional reforms, Government is also committed to concurrent development of the Municipal Reform&#13;
Programme. This programme will have the objectives of rationalizing and harmonizing intergovernmental&#13;
relations; improving local authority access to and use of capital for infrastructure investment; continued&#13;
enhancement of local authority revenue generation capacity; reform of local authority management systems;&#13;
and improvement of local authority recruitment, staffing and training.&#13;
Both the Urban Transport Infrastructure Project and the Municipal Reform Programme support&#13;
broader Government macroecomonic reforms and build on the achievements of its structural adjustment&#13;
programme. As rapid urbanization progresses, the need to provide a climate conducive to better economic&#13;
development will continue to grow. Given Government budgetary constraints for the foreseeable future,&#13;
expanded local provision and operation of basic infrastructure and broader reform of the intergovernmental&#13;
fiscal system are more urgently required than ever, and Government fully intends to act on this need. The&#13;
attached intervention schedule summarizes specific tasks and outputs towards this end.&#13;

PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
The project would cover up to 26 urban centers in Kenya, namely: Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and&#13;
Eldoret (primary towns) and the 22 secondary towns listed in ANNEX 2. It would consist of four,&#13;
complementary components namely: road transport infrastructure maintenance and improvements,&#13;
institutional capacity building, policy studies and project implementation support.&#13;
A central feature of the project is that, in order to be eligible to participate in any project financed&#13;
investments, the project towns must have demonstrated and continue to demonstrate, during the course of&#13;
the project, their commitment to execution of routine road maintenance and to assigning maintenance&#13;
works priority in the utilization of available funds. Although the cost of executing satisfactory annual&#13;
routine maintenance programs would be bome entirely by GOK through the RMF, allocated to the&#13;
project towns on the basis of population, these activities represent the primary project objective and their&#13;
cost represents almost 20% of total project base cost (25% of the total estimated infrastructure&#13;
investments in the 26 towns).&#13;
The project, as detailed below and reflected in the project cost estimates, contains both the project&#13;
components which would be eligible for financing from the IDA Credit and those for which no credit&#13;
financing would be provided. In addition, as the program would be executed in two three-year tranches&#13;
and detailed engineering has been completed only for the first tranche, some variation may be expected&#13;
in the amount of work to be performed in each investment sub-category. The Project comprises:&#13;
1.    Road Transport Infrastructure Investment Program&#13;
Routine road maintenance of about 2000 km of urban streets, during the six-year project tranche&#13;
period, either by local authority own-forces or by contract, in accordance with a satisfactory&#13;
program accepted by TMU, with performance audited by the Maintenance Management and&#13;
Works Inspectorate function by the TMU.&#13;
Periodic road maintenance works, in all the participating project towns, on about 400 km of&#13;
priority paved urban streets, consisting of bituminous surface patching and major resealing,&#13;
painting pavement markings, repair of drains, culverts, foot-paths or bicycle-paths and street&#13;
lighting (where applicable).&#13;
Road rehabilitation works, in all the participating project towns, on about 400 km of priority,&#13;
paved urban streets, consisting of major paved road-surface and road-base repairs, bituminous&#13;
pavement sealing, pavement marking, also repair or reconstruction of curbs, sidewalks, drainage&#13;
structures and facilities, foot-paths and/or bicycle-paths, as well as maintenance of street lighting&#13;
and/or traffic signals, or provision therefor.&#13;
Road improvement works, in primary towns only, on about 75 km of priority streets, consisting&#13;
of construction of strategic missing street sections, selected pavement and/or road widening,&#13;
pavement strengthening (through construction of bituminous over-lays), related pavement&#13;
marking, drainage and street lighting works, and paving of unpaved road surfaces, as well as, in&#13;
Nairobi City only, at selected at-grade street junctions, traffic capacity and safety improvements&#13;
(including institution support and black spot programs) comprised of construction of additional&#13;
traffic lanes, islands, related pavement markings, lighting and traffic and traffic signal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

improvements. The works in Nairobi have been costed and shown separately as supervision of&#13;
contracts, in this case, would be performed by Nairobi City Council engineering staff as&#13;
Engineer's Representative, whereas supervision of all other work contracts would be performed&#13;
by construction supervision consultants.&#13;
SSATP pilot works and investments, specifically targeted to address the issue of mobility of the&#13;
urban poor through an integrated network approach, separate from and in addition to the&#13;
construction and/or improvement of new or existing bicycle-paths and foot-paths, including&#13;
related drainage improvements, designed and included as a part of periodic maintenance and&#13;
road rehabilitation works, above. NMT works would also include pilot traffic management and&#13;
infrastructure interventions in Nairobi and Eldoret (see ANNEX 4 for more details on SSATP).&#13;
2.    Institutional Capacity Building Program&#13;
Establishing the Maintenance Management and Works Inspectorate within the TMU, for the&#13;
purpose of verifying, with assistance from contracted, maintenance and works management&#13;
consultants, the adequacy of routine and periodic maintenance works, by or for local authorities,&#13;
throughout Kenya;&#13;
Consulting technical assistance services to the TMU in Maintenance Planning and Contract&#13;
Management, to establish a comprehensive maintenance management system which would&#13;
include technical reviews of design standards and safety aspects as well as rigorous contract&#13;
management systems.&#13;
Consulting technical assistance services to the TMU in Traffic Management and Coordination,&#13;
comprising traffic engineering and transport planning. The services would cover short-term&#13;
traffic management improvements including traffic control systems, parking, public transport&#13;
facilities, road safety measures and traffic modeling. They would also include advice and&#13;
assistance on long-term land use and environmental matters.&#13;
Trainina and Staff Development for MLG/TM-U and local authority staff, in maintenance&#13;
planning and management, including maintenance contract management, comprised of seminars,&#13;
workshops and overseas training; and&#13;
Road Inventory and Condition Survey by specialized firms, to up-date the data base for all local&#13;
authority road network and its condition to provide the necessary information for forward&#13;
planning for maintenance program and budget.&#13;
3.    Program and Policy Studies&#13;
A Long-Term Traffic Management Study for Nairobi, to develop a strategy which would&#13;
consider, besides transport infrastructure needs, operational, institutional, legislative, land-use&#13;
and environmental measures.&#13;
A Long-Term Investment Program Study for Mombasa, to prepare a program of investments in&#13;
road transport infrastructure, including priority needs before year 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;

4.     Project Implementation Support&#13;
Engineering consulting services, to TMU, for the preparation of detailed engineering designs for,&#13;
and construction supervision services (Construction Supervision Consultants - CSC) for&#13;
management and quality control of civil works construction contracts;&#13;
Financial audit services, by qualified independent auditors, to annually verify financial and&#13;
physical compliance with credit conditions of works for which expenditures are incurred under&#13;
the project;&#13;
Acquisition installation and maintenance of office equipment for the purpose of establishing,&#13;
with assistance of consultants, an up-to-date system of Information Technology commensurate&#13;
with project planning and management requirements; and,&#13;
Non-project town support to the TMU for start up and incremental costs to carry out existing&#13;
maintenance management, planning and monitoring in all urban center (outside the scope of the&#13;
26 project towns) through expanded use of the maintenance management and works inspectorate&#13;
functions.&#13;
5.     Future project preparation support&#13;
Technical assistance for studies, design and implementation arrangements to the MLG, for&#13;
defining a municipal investment program covering other basic infrastructure services is included.&#13;
These activities will support and complement efforts under the MRP. Such activities will&#13;
include, inter alia, improving maintenance and investment planning, resource mobilization and&#13;
expenditure management practices for other municipal services. These initiatives would be&#13;
based on the experience gained in implementing the proposed project as well as the MRP and the&#13;
lessons learned would be applied to other sub-sectors or activities managed by local authorities.&#13;
Possible demonstration projects in selected towns would serve as centers for further training and&#13;
capacity building of local authorities' staff.&#13;

SSATP INITIATIVES AND NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORT&#13;
The Urban Transport Component (UTC) forms part of the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy&#13;
(SSATP) program, a program managed by the World Bank, in partnership with the United Nations&#13;
Economic Commission for Africa. Main objectives of the SSATP, which started in 1987, are to improve&#13;
transport efficiency in SSA through major policy reforms and to strengthen indigenous capacities for&#13;
policy analysis and formulation. The SSATP is implemented through a series of discrete components;&#13;
the Urban Transport Component, Phase I, commenced in 1990.&#13;
In March 1991 the SSATP UTC Phase I dissemination seminar on urban public transport was&#13;
held&#13;
in Yaounde. The study results drew attention to the high cost and poor availability of public transport&#13;
and the lack of non-motorized transport facilities in Africa's urban areas. The urban poor are particularly&#13;
affected because affordable housing, or squatter settlements, are often located on the periphery of the&#13;
urban areas, far from the main employment centers. Consequently, many workers and those in search of&#13;
jobs, have to travel long distances on a daily basis, resulting in public transport expenditures that&#13;
frequently amount up to 30 percent of personal income. This leaves the low income group no other&#13;
option than walking for the majority of their trips.&#13;
Within the framework of the second phase of the Urban Transport Component, a study co-&#13;
financed by the Dutch and the French governments, started out in 1993 to analyze non-motorized&#13;
transport (NMT) development issues in cities of Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Tanzania and Kenya. The&#13;
study was coordinated by a French consultant in the case of the three French speaking countries and a&#13;
Dutch consultant team in Kenya and Tanzania, with strong participation of local expertise. The&#13;
conclusions of the two parallel studies have been discussed and finalized on a workshop in Nairobi in&#13;
October 1994.&#13;
The Dutch government agreed upon financing a follow-up of the NMT study in Kenya and&#13;
Tanzania. Based on Action Plans prepared in Phase I, priority will be given to institutional capacity&#13;
building and implementation of pilot intervention measures in Nairobi, Eldoret, Dar es Salaam and&#13;
Morogoro. The interventions will complement road interventions and include, but are not limited to (1)&#13;
pedestrian/public transport improvements at the local neighbourhood level, (2) integration of NMT and&#13;
socio-economic activities, (3) improvements for cyclists, (4) increased supply of bicycles to promote&#13;
local assembly and repair facilities, (5) educational programs which can foment the use of non-motorized&#13;
transport modes and transform the notion of backwardness attached to NMT by showing advantages and&#13;
examples of their use as complements to road transport.&#13;
Under the Urban Transport Infrastructure Project the activities started under Phase II of the&#13;
SSATP-NMT component will continue and expanded to include two small towns (Busia and Bungoma).&#13;
Before embarking upon large scale investments the results of the pilot projects will be monitored and&#13;
evaluated. This will result in a 'top-ten' of most (cost) effective NMT interventions, that can be&#13;
introduced on a larger scale, using the gradually built-up institutional capacity and local expertise. The&#13;
Project Preparation Units (PPUs), established in Nairobi and Eldoret, under the SSATP program would&#13;
also be expanded, with project financing, to provide training to TMU and local authority engineering&#13;
staff, in the design and implementation of NMT.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF FIRST PHASE INVESTMENTS&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
The major part of the civil works component of KUTIP can be classified into four types:&#13;
(a)    routine maintenance comprising carriageway repair, drain cleaning etc.;&#13;
(b)    periodic maintenance comprising surface treatments or thin overlays on sealed roads and&#13;
regravelling of unsealed roads;&#13;
(c)    rehabilitation of badly deteriorated pavements by means of structural overlays or addition of&#13;
granular base with surface treatment or asphalt wearing course;&#13;
(d)    improvement of existing gravel or earth pavements to sealed standards;&#13;
(e)    capacity improvement by means of dualling and/or redesign ofjunctions.&#13;
Operations (a) through (c) will take place in all 26 project towns, (d) in most smaller towns and, (e) mainly in&#13;
Nairobi and Mombasa.&#13;
The civil works, apart from routine maintenance, will be executed by contracts awarded in two tranches. Design&#13;
for most of the first tranche works, spanning project years I - 3, has been completed by local consultants who&#13;
also supplied the data needed to make rudimentary economic evaluations of the works in (b) through (e) above.&#13;
The analyses of periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and improvement works used a simplified model derived&#13;
from HDM-I and compared 20 year costs with the project and subsequent periodic maintenance against a&#13;
minimum maintenance scenario, with road user savings being the main quantified benefit. By including future&#13;
maintenance, the analyses incorporate the future benefits from the institutionalization of adequate capacity and&#13;
funding for road maintenance and not just the immediate benefits from project funded civil works.&#13;
Separate analyses were made for the capacity improvements where increased travel speed was the main&#13;
quantified benefit.&#13;
PERIOD MAINTENANCE, REHABILITATION AND CAPACITY IMPROVEMENT&#13;
ROAD DATABASE&#13;
Data on the existing road conditions was collected as part of the design process and included:&#13;
road length and width&#13;
existing surface type&#13;
pavement strength expressed as modified structural number&#13;
pavement serviceability expressed as International Roughness Index; this was based on subjective&#13;
judgement rather than metered measurements using the following guidelines:&#13;
2.0           new asphalt pavement&#13;
2.5           new surface dressed pavement&#13;
4 - 5         new murram pavement or asphalt pavement in fair condition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 15&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
6 - 8         murrarn pavement with regular grading or poor asphalt pavement&#13;
8 - 12        murram pavement with irregular maintenance or bad asphalt&#13;
12 - 20       pavements receiving little or no maintenance&#13;
12 hour classified traffic volume counts were made on all roads using five vehicle groups:&#13;
cars&#13;
light goods (pickup)&#13;
medium trucks (2-axle)&#13;
heavy trucks (3-axle or trailers)&#13;
buses (including matatu)&#13;
A traffic growth rate of 5% was used for all evaluations.&#13;
PAVEMENT DETERIORATION AND MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS&#13;
Pavement deterioration, both with and without project, was estimated using an expression derived from the HDM&#13;
III model for sealed roads:&#13;
IRI(t)  =     e o023t [ IRI(o) + 263 (I + MSN)-5 NE4(t)]&#13;
where: IRI(t)  =     IRI in year t since last treatment&#13;
IRI(o) =      HI for existing pavement or immediately after treatment&#13;
MSN   =       the modified structural number of the pavement&#13;
NE4(t) =      cumulative axle loading to year&#13;
For murram pavements, it was assumed that they receive irregular maintenance (occasional grading and local&#13;
patching) and have an average IRI of 12. For earth surfaces an IRI of 20 mv/km was adopted.&#13;
The IRI after different treatments was taken as:&#13;
reconstruction with a/c  2.0&#13;
reconstruction with s/d  2.5&#13;
overlay              2.5&#13;
resealing                   reduction of 0.5 from pre-treatment value&#13;
Following the initial operation, periodic maintenance policies were simulated in the "with project" case. The&#13;
following were thought to be appropriate for Kenya in the foreseeable future:&#13;
high traffic volume (&gt; 5,000 AADT)  overlay in year 10&#13;
medium traffic volume (1,000 - 5,000)   seal in years 8 and 15&#13;
low traffic volume (&lt; 1,000)        seal in year 10 and 19&#13;
For murram roads, regravelling was applied in years 7 and 14.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 15&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
Unit costs of future maintenance were supplied by the design consultants, reflecting regional variations in the&#13;
costs of asphalt and gravelling works.&#13;
ROAD USER COSTS&#13;
For the evaluation of pavement works, vehicle operating cost expressions were derived using the Bank's HDM-&#13;
VOC computer program. This program contains the same models as used in HDM-IlH and allows the user to&#13;
enter unit costs and various parameters that govern VOC under different road conditions (geometry, roughness).&#13;
In the context of pavement rehabilitation and maintenance only the relationship with roughness was of interest as&#13;
the geometry (alignment, gradient) would not change. The input data is shown in Table 1.&#13;

HDM-VOC will output a table giving VOC (KSh/km) for a range of roughness (2 - 15 ni/kin). This table was&#13;
inported into a spreadsheet and a regression analysis made to give a simple expression of the forn:&#13;
VOC = a + b IRI + c IR12&#13;
where: a, b, c are parameters for a particular vehicle group&#13;
VOC is vehicle operating cost in KSh/lcn&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The vehicle groups used for VOC were the same as those given above for traffic data. Table 2 below shows the&#13;
parameters derived from the HDM-VOC model output.&#13;

The annual roughness predicted by the deterioration and maintenance effects models is applied to give the annual&#13;
VOC for each vehicle group. This is then multiplied by the volume for each group for the year; base year volume&#13;
plus growth rate.&#13;
For the evaluation of capacity improvements, average vehicle speed was related to traffic volume and type of&#13;
acility - 2 lane or four lane divided highway:&#13;
V = MIN(75 - 0.000683 (AADT - 10,000), 60)         four lane&#13;
V = MM N(497,430 / AADT - 1.7,60)           :      two lane&#13;
These expressions were derived from the observed speeds shown in Table 3.&#13;

The HDM-VOC model was again used to output a sensitivity table, this time of VOC against speed. Regressions&#13;
were made for a relationship of the form:&#13;
VOC= a + bN&#13;
where: VOC is vehicle operating cost in Ksh/km&#13;
a, b are parameters specific to the vehicle type&#13;
V is the predicted speed&#13;
The values for parameters a and b are shown in Table 4.&#13;

RESULTS OF EVALUATIONS&#13;
The analyses yielded ERRs ranging from under 10% (improvement of roads serving low income areas in smnall&#13;
towns) to over 100% (rehabilitation of high volume roads in the larger towns). It was not possible to quantify&#13;
benefits for some civil works using traditional techniques; this included footpath construction independent of road&#13;
works and improvement of bus stations. The works for which benefits were quantified comprised about 80% of&#13;
the first tranche and showed an overall EIRR of4l%. Costs and benefits were adjusted for taxes and duties.&#13;
Sensitivity testing was made separately for the pavement rehabilitation anc capacity imporvement projects as the&#13;
two analyses were sensitive to different parameters. The results of the sensitiviey analyses are given in Tables 5&#13;
and 6.&#13;

ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF THE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE COMPONENT&#13;
The length of urban roads in Kenya given in the SAR is 6,000kn of which 2,000 are paved and of the total 62%&#13;
(3,700km) are in Nairobi, Kisunu and Mombasa (all project towns). It is reasonable to assume that nearly all of&#13;
the paved roads are included in the project.&#13;
Network-w'ide traffic data is not available but an analysis of data for the first tranche rehabilitation sections,&#13;
adjusted for unpaved, gives the following approximate distribution by traffic volume for paved roads.&#13;

ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
The evaluation concentrated on pothole patching and the effects on pavement structure (and hence performance)&#13;
of maintenance operations should as drain cleaning and shoulder maintenance. Assumed costs were Kshl,000&#13;
/m.2 for patching and KshlO,000 /km/year for drainage and shoulder maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 15&#13;
Page 8 of 9&#13;
Four typical road sections were modelled for the four traffic ranges given above. For each traffic range an&#13;
appropriate pavement structure was defined and the annual development of potholes predicted using the HDM-III&#13;
models. It was assumed that drainage and shoulder operations would yield an increase in pavement structural&#13;
number of 0.5. Annual savings in road user costs were estimated using the HDM-derived model applied in&#13;
previous analyses of rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works. HDM models the annual development of&#13;
new potholes and the enlargement of existing potholes if left unpatched. To allow for enlargement in the without&#13;
maintenance case, a 10 year average of the cumulative potholed area was applied. The results were weighted by&#13;
the lengths in the network to give the following annualised benefit/cost ratios:&#13;
Table 8&#13;
Benefit Cost Ratio for Routine Maintenance&#13;
AADT                  b/c&#13;
250                   1.4&#13;
750                   1.2&#13;
1,500                 2.3&#13;
5,000                 21.1&#13;
Weighted average      9.9&#13;
It is apparent that the b/c is heavily dependent on traffic volume and a regression on the per km results gave the&#13;
following relationship:&#13;
b/c = 14 - 0.0096 AADT + 0.0000034 AADTA2 (R2 = 0.99)&#13;
The weighted average result is thus very sensitive to the assumptions about the proportion of roads with higher&#13;
traffic volumes. If the length of road in the highest traffic range is reduced by 50% and re-distributed among the&#13;
other three ranges, the weighted b/c falls to 6.1, still exceptionally high.&#13;
The routine maintenance component of the project is estimated at $24 million over 5 years, equivalent to an&#13;
average annual expenditure of Ksh50,000 per km. the annualised costs in the above analysis represented only&#13;
Ksh14,000 per km; the remaining expenditure will be on operations whose benefits lack sufficiently robust&#13;
models to allow quantification. If the whole maintenance cost were included in the analysis without any furither&#13;
quantification of benefits, the b/c ratio would be 1.7.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures&#13;
Natural environment:&#13;
(i)    The project requires removal of some trees. Care has been taken at the design&#13;
stage to avoid significant trees where possible. Designs and contract documents&#13;
include provision to replace trees and expand plantings on improved roads.&#13;
(ii)    Drainage effects on erosion and streams: In most cases, road works will not&#13;
increase drainage runoff, and the quality of drainage facilities and protection&#13;
devices will be improved. Where water flows will be channeled or increased,&#13;
designs will ensure appropriate environmental protection. Contract clauses require&#13;
adequate measures to prevent erosion, siltation and drainage protection in all&#13;
works.&#13;
(iii)   Wildlife: No impacts are anticipated on these existing roads in established urban&#13;
areas.&#13;
(iv)   Sensitive roadside environments: These are not an issue in these projects, as roads&#13;
are within existing reserves and no known sensitive environmental areas are&#13;
affected.&#13;
Human and social environment:&#13;
(i)    No land acquisition or permanent resettlement is expected.&#13;
(ii)    Pedestrians and road safety: Special emphasis is placed on improving pedestrian&#13;
facilities on all project roads, through construction and rehabilitation of footpaths&#13;
and crossings, and development of improved design and maintenance standards for&#13;
these facilities. The traffic management component will provide funds for&#13;
identifying and upgrading specific problem locations, such as pedestrian crossings,&#13;
bus stops and intersections - with an emphasis on traffic congestion, public&#13;
transport, pedestrians, and safety. The non-motorized component of the project&#13;
provides specific funds for non-motorized transport facilities and supporting&#13;
services, including improvements to off-road paths.&#13;
Potential Short-term Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures&#13;
(i)    Road work activities will have temporary impacts, both on the road and at quarries,&#13;
borrow pits, material storage sites and work camps. Contract clauses have been&#13;
reviewed to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined for environmental&#13;
protection and site clean-up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 16&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(ii)    Roadside land uses: temporary provisions will be made for roadside access during&#13;
works. Some informal kiosks operating in the road reserve will be temporarily&#13;
affected during works, and alternative sites will be made available by the&#13;
municipalities during these periods.&#13;
(iii)   Temporary disruptions of road service during works can cause particular problems&#13;
in urban areas. The location and duration of road closures, deviations and side-&#13;
tracks will be considered in bidding documents and contract clauses, and in some&#13;
cases specific traffic management plans will be required, to minimize these&#13;
impacts.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening and Monitoring Arrangements&#13;
The government and consultants were assisted during project preparation with the identification and&#13;
recording of potential environmental impacts for all sub-project sites. Monitoring of environmental&#13;
actions and responsibilities will be included as a specific responsibility of supervision consultants.&#13;
Further assistance with review of contract clauses, designs and design standards related to&#13;
environmental impacts and mitigation is included in the tasks of the technical advisor responsible&#13;
for strengthening Ministry of Local Government procedures in the early years of the project.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Urban Transport Project consists of:
            a) road and transport infrastructure investments, b)
            capacity building, c) program and policy studies, d) project
            implementation support, and e) future project preparation
            support. The objectives of the project are to: i) increase
            economic efficiency of the urban road network; and ii) build
            sustainable road maintenance capacity: institutional,
            financial and engineering of the project towns and the
            Ministry of Local Government (MLG) through a program of
            municipal reforms. The project represents a substantial
            investment by the government of Kenya's urban centers
            for the benefit of the national economy. The project will
            serve to: a)establish adequate maintenance capacity and
            encourage basic maintenance discipline to all the local
            authorities and assist the Ministry of Local Government
            (MLG) to efficiently plan, manage, and finance the
            maintenance of urban roads; b) improve conditions of the
            urban roads which are deteriorating rapidly, through a
            balanced investment program of routine and periodic
            maintenance, rehabilitation, improved traffic management
            measures in the project towns; c) direct investment towards
            those segments of the urban road network in the project
            towns which are used largely by the poor and improve the
            latter's access to non-motorized transport facilities;
            d) introduce measures to increase implementation efficiency
            through increased use of existing private sector capacity
            for both construction andmaintenance; and e) improve
            management, financial and operational practices of the
            project towns aimed at strengthening their capacity to
            better finance and maintain road infrastructure.
