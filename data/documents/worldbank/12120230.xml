            Private telecom projects : private activity
            down 15 percent in 2003
        </repnme>

            Drawing on the World Bank's private
            participation in infrastructure project database, this note
            reviews developments in the telecommunications sector in
            2003. Data for the year show that investment in projects
            with private participation was back to 1996 levels. Two
            regions -the Middle East and North Africa and Europe and
            Central Asia-saw private activity grow in 2003. And
            developing country companies were the most active sponsors.
            Private activity in telecommunications in low and
            middle-income countries remained subdued in 2003. Investment
            flows to projects with private participation declined for
            the third consecutive year, amounting to US$28.5 billion.
            Nevertheless, 22 new projects with fixed or mobile operators
            reached financial closure in 16 developing countries. Most
            of the decline in investment occurred in lower-middle-income
            countries, where investment flows dropped from US$11.3
            billion to US$8.8 billion. Low-income countries also
            contributed to the slowdown, with investment flows falling
            from US$6.8 billion to US$5.4 billion. Flows were
            nevertheless strong, the fourth highest for this group in
            1990-2003. Investment flows to upper-middle-income countries
            grew by 9 percent to US$14.2 billion, yet were still close
            to the level of 1996.
