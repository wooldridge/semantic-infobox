A SURVEY OF THE&#13;
FERTILIZER SECTOR IN INDIA&#13;
This paper analyzes the trends and patterns in consumption, pro-&#13;
duction, and distribution of fertilizer nutrients in India, and provides the&#13;
background information for the mathematical programming model of the Indian&#13;
Fertilizer Sector. The consumption and production of chemical fertilizers&#13;
have increased at an annual compound rate of, respectively, 17.9% and 17.6%&#13;
during the last 25 years. Approximately one-third of the consumption re-&#13;
quirements are met through imports. As the growing need for foodgrains in&#13;
India will continue to accelerate the demand for chemical fertilizers, the&#13;
future planning of the fertilizer sector should obviously concentrate on&#13;
devising an optimum combination of domestic production and imports, so that&#13;
future supplies of fertilizer nutrients could be made available to the farm-&#13;
ers at a minimum cost. Various issues related to optimum size, location,&#13;
product-mix, and distribution patterns leading to minimum farm-gate price&#13;
of chemical fertilizers are being explored by the programming methods, and&#13;
will be reported in another paper in this series.&#13;

Summary and Conclusions&#13;
1.        Growing population and increasing per capita income in India will&#13;
continue to accelerate the demand for foodgrains as well as other agricultural&#13;
commodities. Constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land,&#13;
India's future efforts to increase agricultural output have to be concentrated&#13;
in shifting the agricultural production functions upwards for various crops&#13;
by increasing the consumption of fertilizer nutrients along with high-yielding&#13;
varieties on limited land resources.&#13;
2.         Fertilizer consumption in India has recorded an over fifty-fold&#13;
increase during the last 25 years. It increased from 65.7 thousand tons in&#13;
1952-53 to 4,287 thousand tons in 1977-78 with a compound growth rate of&#13;
17.9% per annum. Nitrogen consumption increased at an annual rate of 16.9&#13;
percent while phosphate (P 0 ) and potash (K 20) consumption grew at a compound&#13;
annual rate of 22.8 and 21.0 percent between 1952-53 and 1977-78. In absolute&#13;
terms, nitrogen consumption increased from 57.8 thousand tons in 1952-53 to&#13;
2,915 thousand tons in 1977-78. Similarly, phosphate and potash consumption&#13;
increased from 4.6 and 3.3 thousand tons in 1952-53 to 868 and 505 thousand&#13;
tons in 1977-78.&#13;
3.         Zone-wise, state-wise, and district-wise analysis of fertilizer&#13;
consumption indicates wide regional disparities. Punjab, Haryana, Andhra&#13;
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu accounted for nearly one-half of the&#13;
total fertilizer consumption between 1967-68 and 1977-78. On1 the other&#13;
hand, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh, the three largest states&#13;
having nearly 35% of the total cropped area, accounted for only 15% of total&#13;
fertilizer consumption.   The consumption of fertilizer nutrient is much more&#13;
concentrated at the district level than at the state. In 1974-75, 95 of&#13;
380, i.e., 25%, districts consumed more than two-thirds of the fertilizer&#13;
nutrients used in the country. Thus, efforts must be made to increase&#13;
fertilizer consumption in those districts where its use is minimal.&#13;
4.        Not only are there regional disparities in fertilizer consumption&#13;
in India, but also there are seasonal and crop-wise unevenness. Approximately&#13;
65% of the total fertilizer consumption is concentrated in Rabi season, and&#13;
about one-half is devoted to rice and wheat crops.&#13;
5.         Approximately one-third of the total cropped area was fertilized&#13;
in 1975-76 with a range of 5% (Assam) and 76% (Punjab). The use of ferti-&#13;
lizer nutrients per hectare of fertilized land in the same year varied&#13;
between 28 kgs (Himachal Pradesh) and 128 kgs (Tamil Nadu) with an all-India&#13;
average of 78 kgs. Since about two thirds of the cultivated land is still&#13;
unfertilized, - partly because of lack of knowledge about fertilizers and&#13;
mostly because of paucity of irrigation and credit facilities-efforts must&#13;
be made to diffuse knowledge about fertilizers among non-users through&#13;
extension programs and promotion campaigns, along with developing facilities&#13;
for irrigation and credit. Efforts are also required to obtain a better&#13;
balance between N, P, and K.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
6.        Various institutions and individuals have attempted to forecast&#13;
the future consumption of fertilizer nutrients. These forecasts of fer-&#13;
tilizer consumption by various authors vary between 4.15 m. and 6.46 m. tons&#13;
for 1978-79 and betwen 6.0 and 8.0 million tons in 1983-84.&#13;
7.        A suitable forecasting methodology based on realistic behavioral&#13;
assumptions is still lacking. Although forecasting the future demand for&#13;
fertilizers is a difficult task, due to uncertainties associated with rain-&#13;
fall, prices and other socio-economic factors, an attempt.based on economic&#13;
and non-economic factors influencing the consumption of fertilizer nutrients&#13;
might provide plausible forecasts.&#13;
8.         Installed capacity has increased from 16.7 thousand tons of N&#13;
and 20.5 thousand tons of P 05 in 1950 to 3,028 thousand tons of N and 915&#13;
thousand tons of P205 in 1937 and is likely to reach 7.2 million tons of N&#13;
and 1.5 million tons of P 05 in early eighties. Approximately three-fourths&#13;
of the N capacity is in the form of urea. A small part of the additional&#13;
capacity will be available through nitrophosphate and NPK complex fertilizers.&#13;
No additional capacity is likely to be built for ammonium sulphate and&#13;
calcium ammonium nitrate, the two most important products of the sixties.&#13;
Similarly, TSP and NPK complex fertilizers will occupy major share in addi-&#13;
tional capacity build-ups for P205'&#13;
9.        Nearly one-half of the existing fertilizer capacity is under&#13;
public control, and about 40% under private ownership. The cooperative&#13;
sector controls 9 - 14 percent of the existing capacity. The Indian Farmers&#13;
Fertilizer Cooperative is the only cooperative factory which has plants&#13;
in Kandla and Kalol (Gujarat) and is constructing one at Phulpur (U.P.)&#13;
with the help of a World Bank loan. The share of public sector in fertilizer&#13;
capacity will increase to 62-65 percent after the completion of the approved&#13;
as well as under-construction projects.&#13;
10.       Capacity utilization has varied between 60% and 73% for N and&#13;
between 46% and 66% for P205 during 1973-77 period. Power failures, shortage&#13;
of power supply, limited availability of raw materials, and time-lag in&#13;
obtaining spare parts are stated as some of the improtant factors inhibiting&#13;
capacity utilization in India.&#13;
11.       Like consumption, production of nitrogenous and phosphatic ferti-&#13;
lizers in India has increased severalfold. Nitrogen production increased&#13;
at a compound rate of 17.6% per annum from 53.1 thousand tons in 1952-53 to&#13;
2.0 million tons in 1977-78. Output of phosphatic fertilizers also grew at&#13;
a compound rate of 17.6% per annum between 1952-53 and 19-77-78. In absolute&#13;
terms, the P205 output increased from 7.4 thousand tons in 1952-53 to 670.0&#13;
thousand tons in 1977-78.&#13;
12.       In the fifties and early sixties, ammonium sulphate and single&#13;
superphosphate were the main nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers produced&#13;
in the country. Urea and complex fertilizers have occupied the dominant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
position in the seventies. Approximately, three-fourths of the nitrogen&#13;
was produced in the form of urea in 1977-78. Simiarly, a little less than&#13;
three-fourths of P 205 was manufactured in the form of NP/NPK complex fer-&#13;
tilizer.&#13;
13.       Approximately one-fourth of the nitrogenous and phosphatic fer-&#13;
tilizer requirements are met through imports. As there are no known reserves&#13;
of potash in India, all of the potassic fertilizer requirements are, and&#13;
will continue to be, met through imports. Urea, amonium sulphate, calcium&#13;
ammonium nitrate, diammonium phosphate, and muriate of potash are the main&#13;
fertilizer products imported mainly from Germany (East and West), Poland,&#13;
Italy, Rumania, Quatar, UK, USA and USSR.&#13;
14.       Inspite of the additional capacity build-ups leading to increased&#13;
production of N and P 205 in the early eighties, India will have to rely on&#13;
imports because of increased demand for fertilizer nutrients.&#13;
15.       In the field of raw materials, naphtha occupies an important place&#13;
in nitrogen production, accounting for about 70% of the installed capacity.&#13;
Increased world prices of petroleum products might increase the use of coal&#13;
and natural gas (available from the Bombay High and Cambay basins) as feed-&#13;
stocks for nitrogen production in the future capacity build-ups. Similarly,&#13;
the discoveries of rockphosphate deposits in Udaipur (Rajasthan) and Jhabua&#13;
(M.P.) districts might substitute for imported rock to a small degree.&#13;
16.       The Government of India has always controlled the prices of urea,&#13;
ammonium sulphate and calcium ammonium nitrate. The prices of complex&#13;
and phosphatic fertilizers are generally fixed by the manufactures, although&#13;
a prior governmental approval is mandatory because of the subsidy of Rs.&#13;
1,250 per ton of P2 05 introduced in March 1976. Since the potassic fer-&#13;
tilizers are mostly imported by the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation&#13;
of India, the Government of India fixes (though not statutorily) the prices&#13;
of the potassic fertilizers, too. Thus, the fertilizer market in India is&#13;
not a competitive market, i.e., prices are not determined by the forces of&#13;
demand and supply.&#13;
17.       The Marathe Committee, appointed in January 1976, is currently&#13;
studying the pricing structure of various fertilizer products. The Govern-&#13;
ment of India has fixed the maximum retail prices of urea, ammonium sulphate&#13;
and calcium ammonium nitrate as Rs. 1,550, Rs. 935.0 and Rs. 1,015. The&#13;
Government has also announced the maximum ex-factory prices of these three&#13;
products as Rs. 1,158, Rs. 625, and Rs. 686, respectively. The Marathe&#13;
Committee has provided the ex-factory retention prices for each plant. The&#13;
difference between the maximum ex-factory price and ex-factory retention&#13;
price will be credited/debited to the Fertilizer Price Fund Account. Given&#13;
the existing prices, production of urea, AS and CAN would remain subsidized,&#13;
to a large extent, till March 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
18.       The distribution of fertilizer products is handled by the coopera-&#13;
tive societies as well as private retailers. Of all the retail outlets&#13;
distributing fertilizer products, approximately 60% belong to the coopera-&#13;
tives and other public institutions and 40% to the private sector. Punjab,&#13;
Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jammu&#13;
and Kashmir have predominantly cooperative outlets, whereas states in the&#13;
south and east are served mostly by private retailers.&#13;
19.       Most of the pivate retailers are located at the district or at&#13;
the block/mandi headquarters, while some cooperatives are diffused to&#13;
interior villages. At present, one retail outlet serves approximately&#13;
eight villages. Moreover, the district/block headquarters have more than&#13;
one retailer. Hence, the efforts should be made to increase the retail&#13;
outlets in the isolated and far-off villages in order to increase the&#13;
consumption of fertilizer nutrients.&#13;
20.       Railways account for approximately 80% of the fertilizer traffic&#13;
in India. In 1975-76, railways moved 7.2 million tons of fertilizer products,&#13;
and are expected to move 13 million tons in 1978-79. As the existing railway&#13;
capacity is approaching saturation, increasing fertilizer traffic, along with&#13;
increased average lead and trans-shipment, may create severe distributional&#13;
problems, unless new railway capacity is built-up, and other modes of trans-&#13;
portation are substituted. Product exchange among manufacturers should also&#13;
be encouraged so that unnecessary criss-crossing of fertilizer products be&#13;
lessened.&#13;
&#13;

1.0    Introduction&#13;
India is the seventh largest in area, the second most populous&#13;
country and the most populous democracy in the world. Compared with coun-&#13;
tries in North and South America, Africa, and Australia, India is relatively&#13;
densely populated, whereas in comparison to Japan and most of the countries&#13;
in Europe, India is less densely populated nation.1/ India's population&#13;
has grown at an annual rate of 2.2 percent during 1961-71 period, and is&#13;
likely to grow approximately at the same rate in the next decade or two. It&#13;
is generally believed that heavy population pressures on scarce land re-&#13;
sources have constrained India's economic development. Nevertheless, India's&#13;
gross domestic product (at 1970-71 prices) had increased at an annual rate&#13;
of 3.3 percent during 1961-62 to 1976-77 period, while its per capita gross&#13;
domestic product increased at an average rate of 1.1 percent per annum. The&#13;
GDP is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 4.7% during the&#13;
1978-83 period. The per capita GNP was about US$150.00 in 1976. 2/&#13;
About, 80 percent of India's population lived in rural areas&#13;
and 70 percent of its working population was engaged in agriculture in 1971.&#13;
Nearly one-half of total net domestic product in 1973-74 was produced in&#13;
agricultural sector. The proportion of net domestic product originating in&#13;
agriculture has fluctuated between 45 and 50 percent during the last fifteen&#13;
years.3/ Economic growth in India generally fluctuates around the perform-&#13;
ance of the agricultural sector. In 1975-76, the value added in agriculture&#13;
recorded an annual increase of over 13 percent enabling a record growth of&#13;
8.8 percent in total NDP (in real terms) over 1974-75 level.&#13;
The Draft Five Year Plan 1978-83 has laid greater emphasis on&#13;
agricultural and rural development to achieve the objectives of self-&#13;
reliance, and eradication of unemployment and poverty. Approximately Rs 299&#13;
billion, accounting for about 43% of the total outlays, are provided for&#13;
agricultural and rural development programs. In absolute amount, these&#13;
outlays are nearly double compared to the outlays in the Fifth Plan. 4/ The&#13;
Plan also envisages to speed up the growth rate in agricultural sector from&#13;
about 1.0 percent during 1970-75 period to approximately 4.0% during 1978-83&#13;
period, and enhance foodgrains production from 121 million tons in 1977-78&#13;
to about 141-144 million tons in 1982-83 by investing in irrigation faci-&#13;
lities and extension services. This increased emphasis on agricultural&#13;
production will obviously accelerate the demand for chemical fertilizers,&#13;
because over 50% increase in foodgrainds production between 1970-71 and&#13;
1973-74 is attributed to increased consumption of fertilizers. 5/&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
India has invested considerable resources in building heavy&#13;
industries and socio-economic infrastructure during its four five year&#13;
plans and three annual plans (see Table 1.5). The growth of industrial&#13;
output was at an average annual rate of 7.8.percent during 1955-65 and 3.5&#13;
percent in the following ten years (1965-75). Slow growth of industrial&#13;
output in the latter period is attributed to failure of agriculture, global&#13;
energy crisis of the early seventies resulting into higher import costs, and&#13;
wars with Pakistan.   Industrial production is envisaged to grow at an&#13;
average rate of 7% per annum during 1978-83 period.&#13;
Imports and exports account, respectively, for 6% and 5% of&#13;
India's net national product. Imports play a crucial role in supplying&#13;
technical know-how, machinery and equipments for industrial development.&#13;
Petroleum products, chemical fertilizers, cotton, edible oils, oil seeds,&#13;
and foodgrains are other important import items. Since the ability to&#13;
import depends, to a large extent, on the capacity to export, India has&#13;
made serious efforts to increase its exports. Between 1960-61 and 1973-&#13;
74, India's exports have grown at 7% per annum, and are likely to grow&#13;
at an annual rate of 8.5% during the 1978-83 period. India's major export&#13;
items are tea, cotton and jute textile products, sugar, iron ore and ore&#13;
concentrates, leather goods and "new manufactures" like iron and steel&#13;
products, engineering goods, chemicals, electrical and telephone equipments,&#13;
and other metal products.&#13;
India has rich deposits of coal, iron ore and limestone, and&#13;
plans to become self-sufficient in aluminimum consumption by the end of&#13;
the 5th Plan. In the fields of zinc, copper,lead and nickel, the domestic&#13;
production falls short of demand, and therefore, India has to rely on&#13;
imports. The discovery of Bombay High and Bassein oil fields might help&#13;
India to reduce its dependence on imports for oil and petroleum products and&#13;
increase its production of chemical fertilizers.&#13;
2.0 Indian Agriculture&#13;
Agriculture is the 'most vital' sector of the Indian economy. It&#13;
provides not only food and raw materials but also employment and income to&#13;
a very large proportion of the population. Approximately 72 percent of the&#13;
labor force and 90% of the rural poors are engaged in agriculture. Fluc-&#13;
tuations in agricultural output are generally reflected in aggregate&#13;
national income as well as industrial sector. In 1977-78, the agricultural&#13;
and allied activities sector contributed about 43% to the gross-value-added&#13;
in the country.&#13;
The contribution of the agricultural sector to India's exports is&#13;
equally significant. The exports of raw and processed agricultural commo-&#13;
dities accounted for 38 percent of all exports in 1973-74. If the value of&#13;
manufactured goods having agricultural contents (like cotton, jute, wool,&#13;
leather, etc.) is also included, the contribution of agricultural sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
increases to 54%. 1/ In absolute terms, the agricultural sector exported&#13;
commodities and raw materials worth Rs 963 crores in 1973-74. Thus, it is&#13;
an important source of foreign exchange for India.&#13;
Although the industrial sector has made rapid strides through&#13;
modern technology in recent time, its dependence on agricultural sector is&#13;
still quite significant. An analysis of the intersectoral flows for 1964-65&#13;
by the National Commission on Agriculture revealed that agricultural inputs&#13;
(worth Rs. 2,085 crores) accounted for about 20 percent of the value of&#13;
industrial output (Rs 10,106 crores). In some industries, this dependence&#13;
was to the extent of 40 to 50 percent. The share of agriculture as inputs&#13;
in the total output of gur and sugar is as high as 58%, while in tea and&#13;
coffee it is 42%. Cotton and jute textiles, leather products, and vege-&#13;
table oils are other industries which rely heavily on agricultural sector.&#13;
Besides, the agricultural sector provides wage goods for the workers of the&#13;
industrial sector.&#13;
The contribution of the industrial sector to the growth of agri-&#13;
cultural sector is comparatively small. The value of industrial inputs&#13;
accounted for only 2.53% of the total output in the agricultural sector&#13;
in 1964-65. Although the increased use of fertilizers, electric pumps,&#13;
oil engines, tractors, and pesticides after 1964-65 might have increased&#13;
this share considerally, yet the industrial sector's role in modernizing&#13;
agriculture needs jacking-up.&#13;
In spite of the dominant role played by agriculture in India's&#13;
economy, the growth of agricultural output had been far from satisfactory.&#13;
Agricultural output grew at an annual rate of 4.07% during 1950-51 to 1960-&#13;
61 period, and slowed down considerely thereafter. High rate of growth&#13;
during the fifties was brought about by extending the cultivated area. As&#13;
the scope for further extension of cultivable land narrowed down, intensive&#13;
cultivation through multiple cropping and irrigation in early sixties, and&#13;
through the adoption of new technology in the late sixties and early seven-&#13;
ties (HYV seeds and chemical fertilizers) contributed for further growth in&#13;
agricultural output. The overall annual rate of growth of agricultural&#13;
output between 1961-62 and 1976-77 has been 2.10%. 2/ As 15 million hectares&#13;
of additional cultivated area is expected to be brought about under irriga-&#13;
tion, the rate of growth agricultural output is envisaged to be 4% during&#13;
the 1978-83 period.&#13;
2.1        Structural Characteristics of Indian Agriculture&#13;
2.1.1     Rainfall and Agricultural Specialization.&#13;
With a gross cropped area of 173.92 million hectares and an irri-&#13;
gated area of 48.41 million hectares in 1977-78, India ranks third in area&#13;
1/   See Report of the National Commission on Agriculture, 1976, Part II,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
of cultivated land (after the USSR and USA) and first in irrigated land.&#13;
India cultivates nearly 45 percent of its geographical area.. Approximately&#13;
three-fourths of total cropped area is devoted to foodgrains. Wheat, rice,&#13;
barley, maize, jowar and bajra are main foo:d crops, while cotton, jute,&#13;
sugarcane, tobacco and groundnuts are principal non-food crops.&#13;
Indian agriculture is dependent u rfl0unsoon rain for its water&#13;
needs, and therefore, is very weather sensitive. Krishna has estimated&#13;
the rainfall elasticity of crop output in Punjab as 0.28. 1/ Not only&#13;
rainfall is unpredictable, but also it is mostly concentrated in a four&#13;
month period - June-September - of rainy season (see Table 2.2). Irre-&#13;
gularity and unpredictability of monsoons have produced cyclical patterns in&#13;
India's agricultural production (see Figure 1). A peak in foodgrains&#13;
production corresponds to a very good rainfull year while a trough to a&#13;
drought year. Concentration of rainfall in a short period of four months in&#13;
a year has restricted the growth of multiple cropping. Only 22 percent of&#13;
net area sown was cropped more than once in 1977-78.&#13;
Rainfall has uneven regional variations too. East and West&#13;
Coasts, the Ganges valley, and East Central India receive good to heavy&#13;
rainfall. These areas are also relatively densely populated. Rice, being a&#13;
labor-intensive and water-intensive crop, is largely concentrated in these&#13;
parts of the country. Wheat is grown as a dry or irrigated crop where&#13;
rainfall is lighter. Punjab, Haryana, and U.P. are the main wheat-growing&#13;
states. Maize, jowar and bajra are grown in those parts of Rajasthan,&#13;
Gujarat and Maharashtra where rainfall is generally very low.&#13;
Commercial crops are grown throughout India, but there is some&#13;
regional specialization: tea in Assam and Bengal; jute in Bengal, and&#13;
cotton in Gujarat and Maharashtra; sugarcane in U.P., Bihar, Karnataka and&#13;
Maharashtra; and coffee in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and tobacco in Andhra&#13;
Pradesh. Some rubber is also grown in the South.&#13;
2.1.2     Foodgrains Production&#13;
Cereals and pulses are the basic sources of calories and protein&#13;
for a vast majority of India's population. Foodgrains production has&#13;
increased from 55.01 million tons in 1950-51 to 108.42 million tons in&#13;
1970-71, yielding an impressive compound growth rate of 3.45% per annum (See&#13;
Table 2.4.). However, India's foodgrains production fluctuated widely&#13;
in-between., After reaching a peak level of approximately 88 million tons in&#13;
1964-65, foodgrains production declined to 72-74 million tons in the follow-&#13;
ing two years due to the disastrous droughts of 1965-66 and 1966-67. In&#13;
1967-68, output increased to 95 million tons and showed continuous annual&#13;
increase till it reached another peak level of 108.43 million tons in&#13;
1970-71. Between 1970-71 and 1975-76, foodgrains output fluctuated, mainly&#13;
because of drought conditions in Western India. In 1975-76, foodgrains&#13;

production increased by 19.4% over 1974-75 level and by 11.43% over 1970-71&#13;
level. Late arrivals of monsoon rain in 1976 reduced the foodgrains pro-&#13;
duction in 1976-77 by approximately 10 million tons. However, in 1977-78,&#13;
the foodgrains production is estimated at 121.0 million tons (Table 2.4).&#13;
The target of foodgrains production is 141-144 million tons in 1982-83. 1/&#13;
2.1.3      Irrigation&#13;
As the scope for expanding the cultivable land is limited in&#13;
India, further increases in agricultural output, in general, and in food-&#13;
grains production in particular have to come about by intensive cultiva-&#13;
tion. Intensive cultivation depends on increased use of modern inputs -&#13;
fertilizers and improved seeds - and assured supply of irrigation water.&#13;
Irrigation is an important means of land-augmenting technological change,&#13;
because it increases the effective supply of land in efficiency units by&#13;
shifting the production function upward. Output per hectare on irrigated&#13;
land is much higher than unirrigated land, as is obvious from Table 1.&#13;
Irrigation also reduces the dependence of agricultural production on rain-&#13;
fall. Furthermore, the adoption of yield-raising innovations, like improved&#13;
varieties of seeds and chemical fertilizers, and multiple cropping is&#13;
possible only in irrigated areas.&#13;
Investment in the development of irrigation infrastructure has&#13;
increased from Rs. 434 crores in 1951-56 to Rs. 9,650 crores during the&#13;
Five Year Plan, 1978-83 period (Table 1.5). Gross irrigated area increased&#13;
from 22.6 million hectares in 1950-51 to 48.41 million hectares in 1977-78.&#13;
Although India has the largest irrigated area in the world, only 28% of&#13;
total cropped area is presently irrigated. The Irrigation Commission has&#13;
estimated an irrigation potential of 107 million hectares - 72 million&#13;
hectares from surface water and 35 million hectares from underground water&#13;
resources - in India. The present plan envisages to create an additionl&#13;
irrigation potential of 17 million hectares, of which 15 million hectares&#13;
will be utilized by 1982-83. Thus, total irrigated land will increase to&#13;
63.41 million hectares by the end of 1982-83. Increased availability of&#13;
irrigation water will enhance multiple corpping to 26% of the net area&#13;
sown.&#13;
2.1.4      Size of Holding&#13;
Not only Indian agriculture shows wide fluctuations resulting&#13;
from weather variations, but it is also characterized by low productivity&#13;
and excessive fragmentation. A comprehensive census of agricultural opera-&#13;
tions undertaken in 1970-71 revealed that there were 70 million agricultural&#13;
holdings on an operated area of 162 million hectares, yielding an average&#13;
size of operational holding equal to 2.3 hectares (Table 2.7). Of these,&#13;
50% holdings are of less than 1 hectare, and 70% holdings are of less than&#13;

2 hectares.   Thus, majority of the cultivators are small cultivators with&#13;
small operational holdings. Furthermore, these holdings are fragmented,&#13;
scattered and excessively parcelized. In 1960--61, there were approximately&#13;
6 parcels per operational holding. Minhas has suggested a program of&#13;
compulsory consolidation of holdings, along with an integrated development&#13;
of irrigation infrastructure and public works programs in rural areas, to&#13;
increase the productive capacity of the agricultural sector. 1/&#13;
Studies in the Economics of Farm Management by the Govermnent&#13;
of India in various districts have revealed a negative assocaition between&#13;
the size of holding and land productivity. Availability of relatively&#13;
cheap family labor makes these farms labor-intensive. Size of holding is&#13;
also negatively related with cropping intensity and irrigation (see Table&#13;
2.8). Recent survey by the NCAER has revealed that in many states there is&#13;
a negative association between the size of holding and fertilizer use per&#13;
hectare. That is, small farms have higher usage of chemical fertilizers&#13;
compared to their larger counterparts (see Table 2.9). Thus, higher output&#13;
per hectare on smaller farms results from higher labor, water and ferti-&#13;
lizers as well as intensive cultivation of land.&#13;
Since small farms are relatively labor-water-fertilizer in-&#13;
tensive, the small size of cultivation holding per se might not obstruct&#13;
economic growth and the adoption of new technology of production in agri-&#13;
1/   See B.S. Minhas, "Planning and the Poor" (New Delhi:     S. Chand &amp;&#13;
Co., 1974), Chap. 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
cultural sector. 1/ In fact, small farmers have adopted modern inputs -&#13;
fertilizers and improved seeds-as earnestly as large farmers (see Table&#13;
2.9). The National Commission on Agriculture has also recommended that in&#13;
India's context, small peasant proprietor-based agriculture development is&#13;
the most desirable and has to be consciously planned and promoted. The&#13;
Small Farmers Development Agency was created in 1969-70 to help small&#13;
farmers in the adoption of new technology of production and better farm&#13;
practices.&#13;
In addition to consolidation of land holdings, redistribution&#13;
of land from large farmers to landless agricultural workers, tenant cul-&#13;
tivators and marginal farmers through effective land reforms is considered&#13;
important to increase production and eradicate poverty in rural areas.&#13;
On efficiency grounds, the redistribution of land will not reduce output,&#13;
although probability is high that it might increase output because of&#13;
high labor-intensity of small farms. On the equity front, redistribution of&#13;
land will produce egalitarian distribution of income in rural areas, because&#13;
land is the main income-generating asset in the countryside.&#13;
2.1.5     New Technology of Production&#13;
Although land, labor and animal power still dominate agricultural&#13;
production in India, 2/ the use of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers,&#13;
oil engines and electric pumps have grown rapidly in recent years. Con-&#13;
sumption of chemical fertilizers was 20.1 kgs per hectare of cultivated land&#13;
in 1976-77 as against 1.93 kgs per hectare in 1960-61. Similarly, high&#13;
yielding varieties of seeds were used on 15.5% of total cropped area in&#13;
1973-74 as against 1.2% of gross area sown in 1966-67. The use of electric&#13;
pumps and oil engines increased from 1 million in 1965-66 to 4.2 million in&#13;
1973-74, while the number of tractors employed registered threefold increase,&#13;
from 54 thousand in 1965-66 to 170 thousand in 1972.&#13;
2.2       Patterns of Growth:   Recent Trends&#13;
Studies in growth of output and patterns of growth of input&#13;
show that in certain regions of the country growth in agriculture output is&#13;
primarily explained by spread of irrigation and multipile cropping, while&#13;
in others it is due to water, seed and fertilizer technology. The picture&#13;
varies from district to district. Table 2.11 presents comparative data&#13;
on gross value of crop output along with important inputs in the triennium&#13;
1/   The average size of holding is much smaller in Japan and S. Korea&#13;
than in India, while their average yields are much higher compared&#13;
to India (See Table 2.10).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
1970-71 to 1972-73 at the district level. Approximately 18% of the dis-&#13;
tricts in India cultivating 15% of gross cropped area produced 28 percent of&#13;
aggregate output and had per hectare output above Rs. 1,500.     These dis-&#13;
tricts accounted for 39% of chemical fertilizers consumed, 41% pumpsets&#13;
installed, 47% tractors used and 34 percent gross irrigated area in the&#13;
country. The next 25 percent districts had a yield of Rs. 1,000 - 1,500 per&#13;
hectare, and accounted for approximately 25 percent of total cropped area&#13;
and produced 32 percent of aggregate output. Their share among major inputs&#13;
was more or less equal to their share in aggregate output. Taken together,&#13;
these two groups of districts accounted for approximately 60% of the aggre-&#13;
gate output and above 60% of major inputs. The remainder of the districts,&#13;
approximately 58%, had yields of less than Rs. 1,000 per hectare and&#13;
accounted for 40% of aggregate output. Their share in major inputs was&#13;
also comparatively low.&#13;
An analysis of growth rates of value of agricultural output&#13;
during 1962-63 to 1964-65 and 1970-71 to 1972-73 period reveals that the&#13;
districts, which recorded an annual compound growth rate of above 3%,&#13;
accounted for 39% of fertilizers consumed and 45% of gross irrigated area&#13;
in the country (see table 2.12). Nearly one-third of the districts&#13;
experienced an annual compound growth rate of 1 to 3 percent. Their share&#13;
in aggregate output and major inputs was close to one-third. Growth rate&#13;
of 1 to 3 percent per annum was a model growth rate for the country during&#13;
this period.&#13;
Thus, a comparative analysis of growth rates and levels of per&#13;
hectare output at the district level identifies the critical role of&#13;
chemical fertilizers and irrigation development in enhancing agricultural&#13;
production.&#13;
3.0        Consumption and Demand Forecasts of Fertilizer Nutrients&#13;
The National Commission on Agriculture has estimated that the&#13;
demand for foodgrains will be between 150 and 163 million tons in 1985&#13;
and between 205 and 225 million tons in 2,000. As the scope for expanding&#13;
cultivable area is extremely limited, most of the additional increases in&#13;
foodgrains production in India has to come about by increased land produc-&#13;
tivity. The Commission has further postulated that a supply of 164 million&#13;
tons of foodgrains can be created if the consumption of chemical fertilizers&#13;
increases to 9 million tons. "If, however, the fertilizers consumption&#13;
reaches only 7 million tons, production will be of the order of 150 million&#13;
tons. The production of other crops will also be lower. The lower growth&#13;
rate in agricultural production would result in a shortfall in the overall&#13;
growth rate, income and demand for foodgrains and other agricultural com-&#13;
modities." 1/ Thus, fertilizer consumption will play a critical role in&#13;
shaping IndTa's future agricultural development.&#13;

In 1977-78, the total fertilizer consumption was of the magnitude&#13;
of 4.3 million tons - 54% above the 1973-74 record level consumption of&#13;
2.8 million tons. To meet the targets of 150 and 163 million tons of&#13;
foodgrains production in 1985, fertilizer consumption has to increase,&#13;
respectively, by 63 and 109% in a period of seven years. To assess the&#13;
feasibility and compatibility of these targets, we now turn to a detailed&#13;
analysis of the past trends, present status and future potentials of con-&#13;
sumption, production, and distribution of fertilizer nutrients and products&#13;
in India.&#13;
3.1       Fertilizer Consumption&#13;
Fertilizer consumption in India recorded an over fifty-fold&#13;
increase during the last 25 years. It increased from 65.7 thousand tons in&#13;
1952-53 to 4.29 million tons in 1977-78 with a compound growth rate of 17.9&#13;
percent per annum. Between 1952-53 and 1973-74, the consumption of fer-&#13;
tilizer nutrients showed an uninterrupted upward trend and was doubling&#13;
almost every five years. Between 1952-53 and 1962-63, fertilizer consump-&#13;
tion showed an increase of 384 thousand tons, whereas between 1963-64 and&#13;
1973-74, it increased by over 2 millions tons. Thus, in absolute terms,&#13;
fertilizer consumption recorded significant increase in the latter period.&#13;
The introduction of high-yielding varieties under Intensive Area Development&#13;
Programs and Intensive District Development Programs gave a boost to fer-&#13;
tilizer consumption in the sixties. Concentrating development resources in&#13;
a few potentially productive districts did result into increased fertilizer&#13;
consumption and foodgrains production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
In 1974-75, fer'tilizer consumption decreased to 2.6 million tons&#13;
compared to 2.8 million tons in the previous year. The fertilizer crisis 1/&#13;
of 1973-74 resulting in increased fertilizer prices is considered the main&#13;
cause for this 9 percent decrease in fertilizer use. Nitrogen (through urea)&#13;
price increased from Rs. 2.28 per kilogram in 1973-74 to Rs. 4.35 per kg. in&#13;
1974-75: an increase of 90 percent. Similarly, SSP and MOP prices increased,&#13;
respectively, by 89 and 81 percent. In real terms, the amount of paddy and&#13;
wheat required to purchase 1 kg of nitrogen increased, respectively, from&#13;
3.26 and 3.00 kilogram in 1973-74 to 5.89 and 4.14 kilograms in 1974-75.&#13;
What's true for nitrogen (urea) is also true for phosphate and potash. 2/&#13;
In 1975-76, the fertilizer consumption recovered the 1973-74&#13;
level, while in 1976-77, it registered an increase of approximately 18&#13;
percent over 1975-76 consumption levels (see Table 3.3). This increase in&#13;
fertilizer consumption is mainly attributable to decreased prices, and&#13;
increased promotional efforts of the Government and industry, the Govern-&#13;
mental price support and procurement policies, and the extension of area&#13;
1/   In early seventies, prices of oil and other petroleum products were&#13;
oligopolistically increased significantly by the OPEC cotntries.&#13;
Increased prices of naphtha, natural gas, and other petroleum pro-&#13;
ducts accelerated 'the cost of production of fertilizer products.&#13;
When the world was engulfed in an atmosphere of energy crisis, there&#13;
came the forecasts, by the leading international organizations, of&#13;
shortages of fertilizers resulting into deficits in food proudction and&#13;
agricultural output in developing countries.     A prediction of gloom and&#13;
starvation resulting from the shortages of fertilizers and food prompted&#13;
some densely populated developing countries like India, Indonesia and&#13;
the Philippines to nearly double their purchases of fertilizers in&#13;
1974-75 (see below). Large scale purchases by these countries further&#13;
accelerated the fertilizer prices in 1974 climaxing to peak levels in&#13;
June 1974. This atmosphere of anticipated 'shortages of fertilizers'&#13;
leading to steep increases in fertilizer prices is referred as the&#13;
'fertilizer crisis'.&#13;

under irrigation and high-yielding varieties crops. 1/ The 1977-78 year&#13;
has recorded a 26.5% increase in fertilizer consumption over 1976-77&#13;
reaching an all-time high level of 4.3 m. tons.&#13;
3.1.1.    Nutrientwise Consumption&#13;
Along with NPK consumption, the consumption of each nutrient also&#13;
increased significantly in absolute as well as in relative terms during the&#13;
last twenty five years. Nitrogen consumption increased at an anual rate of&#13;
16.9 percent, while phosphate (P 0 ) and potash (K 0) consumption grew at a&#13;
an22O                2&#13;
compound annual rate of 22.8 and 21.0 percent between 1952-53 and 1976-78.&#13;
In absolute terms, nitrogen consumption increased from 57.8 thousand tons&#13;
in 1952-53 to 2,915 thousand tons in 1977-78. Similarly, phosphate and&#13;
potash consumption increased from 4.6 and 3.3 thousand tons in 1952-53 to&#13;
868 and 505 thousand tons in 1977-78.&#13;
Although the end-point analysis of consumption of fertilizer&#13;
nutrients is useful, it is less revealing of the temporal variations in&#13;
fertilizer consumption. In Table 3.3, the entire priod is divided itto&#13;
three groups. Between 1952-53 and 1962-63, the total fertilizer consumption&#13;
increased at an annual compound rate of 21.1 percent, whereas N, P205 and&#13;
K20 consumption grew, respectively, at a rate of 19.1, 33.5 and 27.1. percent&#13;
per annum. In the next ten-year period (1962-63 to 1972-73), the consump-&#13;
tion of all nutrients increased at a lower rate compared to the previous&#13;
decade, although in each case the rate of growth of consumption was above 15&#13;
percent. In the third period (1972-73 to 1977-78), the rates of growth of&#13;
nitrogen, phosphate and potash consumption are significantly low, viz.,&#13;
9.6, 8.6 and 7.8 percent respectively.&#13;
Each fertilizer nutrient (N, P205 and K20) witnessed decline in&#13;
1974-75 (Table 3.2) as a result of increased prices. Although the nitrogen&#13;
consumption in 1976-77 is significantly above the 1973-74 level, the phos-&#13;
phate and potash consumption levels in 1976-77'were below the 1973-74&#13;
levels. In 1977-78, the consumption of P205 and K20 surpassed the 1973-74&#13;
levels.&#13;
3.1.2     Regional Distribution&#13;
Although the consumption of fertilizer nutrients showed continuous&#13;
increases over time till 1973-74 at the all India level, it did not show&#13;
similar trends at the zonal level. In absolute terms, the fertilizer&#13;
consumption increased from 402.9, 154.1, 238.1, 657.1 and 223.8 thousand&#13;
tons in 1968-69 to 1136, 421, 664, 1304 and 656 thousand tons in 1977-78 in&#13;
the Central East, North, South and West zones respectively. In relative&#13;
terms, the Central, East, North, South and West zones experienced an increase,&#13;
respectively, of 182, 173, 179, 98 and 193 percent during 1968-69 and 1977-78&#13;
period (Table 2). The lowest percentage increase in the fertilizer consump-&#13;
tion in the South zone is, perhaps, due to its wider base in 1968-69 compared&#13;
to other zones.&#13;

July 1978.&#13;
The regional distribution of fertilizer consumption shows wide&#13;
disparities among different zones (See Table 3.5). The North and South&#13;
zones accounted for approximately half of the fertilizer consumption in&#13;
the country between 1968-69 and 1975-76, whereas their share in net cropped&#13;
area was slightly more than one-fourth of the total cultivated land in&#13;
India. The main reason for their disproportionately larger share in fer-&#13;
tilizer consumption is the development of irrigation facilities and the&#13;
introduction of high-yielding varieties crops. Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu&#13;
and Andhra Pradesh are the important states in these zones which have&#13;
experienced growth in their agricultural output through Green Revolution.&#13;
Furthermore, these states grow mainly wheat and rice for which improved&#13;
seeds were rapidly developed in the sixties. The Western zone accounts for&#13;
approximately 16-17 percent of total fertilizer consumption. Its share is&#13;
roughly equal to its contribution to net cultivated area in the country.&#13;
The Central and East zones, though account for more than 50% of the total&#13;
cultivated land, have consumed nearly one-third of the fertilizer nutrients&#13;
in the country between 1968-69 and 1975-76.&#13;
Between 1975-76 and 1976-77, the East, West and North zones&#13;
have maintained their share in fertilizer consumption whereas the South zone&#13;
has lost its share by 6.5 percentage points and the Central zone has in-&#13;
creased its share by 5.2 percentage points. Not only the South zone reduced&#13;
its relative share, but the quantity of fertilizer nutrients consumed also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
decreased from 1,000.2 thousand tons in 1975-76 to 960.2 thousand tons in&#13;
1976-77. The failure of monsoon rain is considered to be the main reason&#13;
for the decline in fertilizer consumption in the South zone. I/&#13;
The statewise analysis of the share in fertilizer consumption&#13;
reveals further disparities (Table 3.6). Punjab and Haryana consumed&#13;
15 percent of total fertilizers against their share of 6.5% in the cul-&#13;
tivated land. If U.P., Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are included with&#13;
Punjab and Haryana, their share increases to 56% in fertilizer consumption&#13;
whereas these states account for little less than one-third of the cul-&#13;
tivated land in the country. Larger states like Rajasthan, Maharashtra and&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, which cultivate nearly 35% of total cropped land in the&#13;
country, have relatively low levels of fertilizer consumption.&#13;
The district level analysis of the fertilizer consumption reveals&#13;
further glaring regional disparities. Twenty of 380, i.e. 5%, districts&#13;
accounted for about 23 percent of the fertilizer consumption in India in&#13;
1974-75 (Table 3.7). On the other hand, 209 districts, i.e. more than half&#13;
of all the districts, consumed approximately 13% of the fertilizer nutrients&#13;
in the same year. Simiarly, the top 25% of the districts accounted for&#13;
approximately two-thirds of the fertilizer consumption in India, while the&#13;
remaining 75 percent account for little less than one-third. Thus, the&#13;
attempts to increase fertilizer consumption in India must devise a strategy&#13;
to diffuse fertilizer nutrients in those districts where the present levels&#13;
of fertilizer use are minimal.&#13;
3.1.3     Per Hectare Fertilizer Consumption&#13;
The consumption of fertilizers per hectare of cropped land has&#13;
increased from less than 2 kg. in 1960-61 to 26.2 kgs in 1977-78: a thir-&#13;
teen-fold increase (Table 3.8). Like total consumption, per hectare use of&#13;
fertilizer has shown trend increase till 1973-74. In 1974-75, per hectare&#13;
use fertilizer nutrients decreased to 15.9 compared to 17.4 in the previous&#13;
year. In the following two years, it showed continuous increase. In spite&#13;
of this ten-fold increase in the last sixteen years, per hectare use of&#13;
ferilizer nutrients in India is very low compared to other developing&#13;
countries like China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Egypt, Israel, Indochina and&#13;
Philippines (See Table 3.8).&#13;
Table 3.9 presents the data on per hectare fertilizer use in&#13;
different zones and states in India for two years, viz., 1976-77 and 1977-&#13;
78. The North and East zones had, respectively, the highest and the lowest&#13;
per hectare use in both years. All the zones registered an increase in&#13;
their per hectare fertilizer consumption in 1977-78 over 1976-77 levels.&#13;
Among different states, Punjab tops the list in per hectare use of ferti-&#13;
lizers. Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh are among other states&#13;
using high doses of chemical fertilizers per hectare of cropped land. Nagaland,&#13;
1/   See Fertilizer News, July 1977, p. VII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Assam and Tripura fall on the bottom ring of the fertilizer consumption&#13;
ladder. Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka show the medium levels of fer-&#13;
tilizer use. So far, none of the states have achieved the levels of fer-&#13;
tilizers consumption recommended by the agronomist and soil scientists to&#13;
achieve the maximum yields.&#13;
This analysis of the fertilizer use per hectare of cropped land&#13;
in India is less revealing of the fertilizer intensity in the Indian agri-&#13;
culture. The NCAER survey has revealed that only one-third of the cropped&#13;
land in India was fertilized in 1975-76, and the per hectare consumption of&#13;
fertilizer nutrients on the fertilized land was about 78 kgs. 1/ Interstate&#13;
variations in fertilizer consumption and fertilized land are presented in&#13;
Table 3.9A. The ratio of fertilized land to total cropped land varies&#13;
between 5% (Assam) and 76% (Punjab). The cultivating households in Kerala,&#13;
Punjab, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Haryana used fertilizers on nearly&#13;
one-half or more of their cultivated land. Orissa, Rajasthan, Madhya&#13;
Pradesh and Assam have one-fifth or less of the cultivated land as ferti-&#13;
lized. The fertilizer consumption per hectare of the fertilized land is&#13;
highest in Tamil Nadu (128.1 kgs) and lowest in Himachal Pradesh (28.4 kgs).&#13;
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab and East Bengal are other states&#13;
applying about 90 or more kilograms of NPK nutrients on one hectare of&#13;
fertilized land. Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and Bihar&#13;
have relatively low levels (less than 50 kgs) of fertilizer consumption.&#13;
Although Punjab and Orissa have identical levels of fertilizer use, the&#13;
coverage (proportion of cultivated land being fertilized) is wide spread in&#13;
the former as compared to very narrow in the latter.&#13;
3.1.4.    Seasonwise and Cropwise Consumption&#13;
In absolute as well as relative terms, a larger quantity of fer-&#13;
tilizer nutrients is used in Rabi (winter) season than in Kharif (monsoon)&#13;
season (Table 3.10). Between 1968-69 and 1977-78, the proportion of fer-&#13;
tilizers consumed in Rabi season has varied between 50 and 65 percent. The&#13;
main reason for this concentration in Rabi season is that wheat is a Rabi&#13;
crop in India for which various varieties of fertilizer-intensive and yield-&#13;
raising improved seeds have been developed and adopted by the farmers.&#13;
Moreover, rice is also grown in this season. Since winter crops are generally&#13;
grown in assured water supply areas, and the availability of water reduces&#13;
the risks involved in using chemical fertilizers, the farmers prefer to use&#13;
relatively more fertilizers in winter than in monsoon season. Except 1974-75,&#13;
the fertilizer consumption in Rabi seasons has increased uninterruptedly&#13;
between 1968-69 and 1977-78. On the other hand, the fertilizer consumption&#13;
in Kharif (monsoon) season shows temporal fluctuations. Having increased&#13;
continuously between 1968-69 and 1971-72, the fertilizer consumption in&#13;
Kharif season declined in 1972-73, increased and attained a maximum in&#13;
1973-74. The next two years witnessed continuous declines, followed by two&#13;
years of increase. Although the fertilizer consumption increased by 181&#13;
thousand tons in 1976-77 over the 1975-76 level, yet it was below the 1973-74&#13;
1/   See NCAER, Fertilizer Demand Study:   An Interim Report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
record level. Droughts in Central and Western India in 1972-73 and the late&#13;
arrivals of monsoon rain in 1974-75 and 1975-76 along with increased ferti-&#13;
lizer prices are responsible for these annual variations in fertilizer&#13;
consumption in Kharif season. The proportion of the fertilizer nutrients&#13;
consumed in this season has varied between 35 and 50 percent. In 1977-78,&#13;
fertilizer consumption in Kharif increased to 1,522 thousand tons.&#13;
No detailed data are available for cropwise distribution of fer-&#13;
tilizer consumption in India. The preliminary calculations done by NCAER&#13;
suggest that nearly 40 percent of total fertilizer nutrients consumed in&#13;
India are accounted for by rice, 24 percent by wheat, and 9% by sugarcane&#13;
(Table 3.11). Thus, a little less than three fourths of the fertilizer&#13;
nutrients are used for these three crops.&#13;
3.1.5. N:P:K Ratio&#13;
Table 3.12 provides the information about nutrient ratios (N3P:K)&#13;
in India for different years. Although there is no clear trend, the nitrogen&#13;
consumption per unit of phosphate had been fluctuating and declining over&#13;
time. In early fifties, the Indian farmers were using 7 to 10 times of N per&#13;
unit of P 205. In the late sixties and early seventies, this ratio was&#13;
between 3 and 4 units of N per unit of P20,.    Having declined to 2.8 in&#13;
1973-74, the N:P ratio increased to 3.7 and 4.6 in the following two years.&#13;
The ratio of K20 per unit of P205 was on the average close to 0.5 in the&#13;
sixties and early seventies.&#13;
The N:P:K ratio was 4.6:1:0.6 in 1975-76, 3.9:1.05 in 1976-77, and&#13;
3.4:1:0.6 in 1977-78. To attain balance in fertilizer use, India should&#13;
concentrate her efforts on increasing the consumption of phosphate and&#13;
potash. Farm level studies have also indicated that output per hectare is&#13;
maximum when all the three nutrients are used in balanced proportions. 1/&#13;
The departure from the balanced fertilization norm is much severe&#13;
at the zonal and state levels than at the national level. The N:P ratio was&#13;
above 5 in the Central, East and North zones and was close to 4 in the South&#13;
and West zones in 1975-76 (Table 3.13). The N:P ratio decreased in a mono-&#13;
tonic fashion for all the zones in 1976-77. It was 4.8 in East and Central&#13;
zones, close to 3.5 in the North and South and less than 3 in the West. The&#13;
K:P ratio varied between 0.1 in South zone to 0.8 in the West in 1975-76 and&#13;
showed similar fluctuations in 1976-77. Over time, this ratio was stable for&#13;
the Central, East, and North zones and unstable for the South and West&#13;
zones.&#13;
The wider variations in the state level N:P:K ratios are consistent&#13;
with the law of large number implying lesser variations in macro units&#13;
1/   See Bhumbla, "Balanced Fertilization", 1976.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
compared to their micro-constituents. The N:P ratio fluctuated between 1.6&#13;
(Goa) and 10.4 (Haryana) in 1975-76 and between 1.8 (Meghalaya) and 7.4&#13;
(Haryana) in 1976-77. Like the zonal N:P ratios, the state N:P ratios do not&#13;
reveal any consistent pattern of change over time: in some states it has&#13;
increased while in others it decreased. The K:P ratios, like the N:P ratios,&#13;
are equally unstable among states as well as over time. Kerala, Karnataka,&#13;
and West Bengal appear to have reasonable N:P:K ratios, while Punjab, Haryana&#13;
and U.P. are using proportionately more of N, and less of P and K.&#13;
3.1.6     Factors Influencing Fertilizer Consumption in India&#13;
Unless there is a systematic study based on a behavioral model&#13;
identifying the critical variables influencing fertilizer consumption over&#13;
time as well as over space, any analysis of factors affecting fertilizer&#13;
consumption in India should be treated as suggestive, rather than as diag-&#13;
nostic and prescriptive. The earlier analysis of fertilizer consumption has&#13;
been rather too aggregative. Moreover the data on fertilizer consumption are&#13;
available only after 1961-62. Before 1961-62, the information available&#13;
indicates the distribution of fertilizer nutrients from the Central Fer-&#13;
tilizer Pool and manufacturers to various distributing agencies (public&#13;
and privates) in different states.   Although a large part of these distri-&#13;
buted fertilizers must have gone for consumption, the quantity of fertilizer&#13;
use is still uncertain. Hence, in Table 3, the annual variation in fer-&#13;
tilizer consumption is calculated from 1961-62 onward. The annual percentage&#13;
increases were of high magnitude, ranging between 20% and 49%, during 1961-62&#13;
and 1967-68 period except for 1965-66 drought year. From 1967-68 to 1971-72,&#13;
the annual fertilizer consumption varied between 13 and 18 percent. These&#13;
percentage changes are significantly lower compared to the 1961-62 to 1967-68&#13;
period, although in absolute terms, the fertilizer consumption increased by&#13;
200-400 thousand tons per annum. The next two years witnessed rather modest&#13;
increases (3 to 4 percent) while the 1974-75 year registered a 9% decrease&#13;
in the consumption of fertilizer nutrients due to steep increases in fer-&#13;
tilizer prices. After 1974-75, fertilizer consumption started increasing due&#13;
to lowered prices, effective support prices and procurement policies, and&#13;
extension efforts by the government as well as by the manufacturers.&#13;
Studies by Gunvant Desai 1/ of Indian Institute of Management,&#13;
Ahmedabad and by A. Seshan 2/ of the Reserve Bank of India indicate that,&#13;
except 1974-75 when prices of fertilizer products nearly doubled, the price&#13;
environment prevailing in the sixties and seventies was not very inhibitive,&#13;
and therefore, any manipulation of prices alone will not promote fertilizer&#13;
consumption, although stability of fertilizer prices is considered very&#13;
crucial for further growth in fertilizer consumption. That is, the stable&#13;
price environment plays a permissive, as against promotive, role in enhancing&#13;
fertilizer use.&#13;

Other factors considered crucial for fertilizer promotion are&#13;
irrigation facilities, diffusion of HYVs and availability of credit along&#13;
with fertilizers. The NCAER survey of about 22,000 cultivating households&#13;
has revealed that approximately 55% of the cultivating households were not&#13;
using fertilizers in 1975-76, and the lack of irrigation facilities was the&#13;
main reason for 48% of them for not using fertilizers. Also, among the&#13;
fertilizer users, the application rates of fertilizer nutrients differed&#13;
significantly among those who have irrigation facilities compared to those&#13;
who do not (see Table 4). The per hectare consumption of fertilizer&#13;
nutrients was 55.3 kgs on irrigated farms as against 31.8 kgs on unirrigated&#13;
farms growing 'traditional' varieties of wheat. For high-yielding varieties&#13;
of wheat, the irrigated farms were using 85.5 kgs of fertilizers compared to&#13;
50.2 kgs by their non-irrigated counterparts. For paddy, sugarcane and&#13;
cotton also, the application rates are higher by a margin of 14 to 104&#13;
percent on irrigated farms compared to unirrigated farms. Furthermore, 86%&#13;
of the total fertilizer consumption in 1975-76 was on irrigated farms.&#13;
The district-wise and state-wise analyses of fertilizer consumption&#13;
also reveal irrigation as an important factor influencing the interstate&#13;
and interdistrict variation in fertilizer use. Thus, the availability oE&#13;
irrigation facilities appears as an important factor influencing fertilizer&#13;
consumption, and therefore, the creation of an additional 15 million hectares&#13;
of irrigation facilities in the new plan (1978-83) should stimulate fertilizer&#13;
consumption in the next five years.&#13;
Along with irrigation should come the diffusion of high-yielding&#13;
variaties of seeds on a wider scale. Since the HYVs are water intensive as&#13;
well as fertilizer responsive, the increased use of these seeds will stimu-&#13;
late the demand for fertilizer nutrients. In 1975-76, fertilizer use was&#13;
85.5 kg per hectare for HYVs as against 55.3 kg for traditional varieties of&#13;
wheat on irrigated farms (see table 4). By using the data on fertilizer&#13;
consumption, prices and area under HYVs for 1961-62 to 1971-72 period,&#13;
Dharam Narain has estimated that 1% increase in area under HYVs increased the&#13;
fertilizer consumption by 11%. 1/ Furthermore, the technological change&#13;
(HYVs) explained approximately 50% of the total variation in fertilizer&#13;
consumption as against 18% by the price variations during this period. Thus,&#13;
extension efforts in spreading the high yielding varieties on wider areas,&#13;
and the development of new varieties for dry farming regions will accelerate&#13;
fertilizer consumption.&#13;
The increased demand for HYVs and fertilizers induced by irrigation&#13;
development will be materialized if adequate resources are available with the&#13;
farmers. The NCAER survey has indicated nearly one-fifth of the cultivating&#13;
households identified credit as an important constraint restricting the&#13;

extensive as well as intensive use of fertilizers. As the fertilizer con-&#13;
sumption spreads to small and marginal farmers, the need for credit faci-&#13;
lities will accelerate. Hence, adequate provisions must be made for in-&#13;
creased funds through cooperatives, banks and other institutional agencies.&#13;
The development of irrigation and credit facilities along with&#13;
the diffusion of HYVs will help in promoting fertilizer use only if ferti-&#13;
lizer nutrients are available in adequate quantities at the village level.&#13;
Many a times, the shortages of fertilizer nutrients are identified as a&#13;
factor responsible for slower growth. The state officials in Maharashtra and&#13;
Rajasthan complained of inadequate supplies restricting the increased use of&#13;
fertilizer nutrients.   A time series analysis of consumption and availability&#13;
of fertilizer nutrients during the sixties and seventies by Gunvant Desai 1/&#13;
reveals that decrease in closing stocks (as % of consumption) is partly&#13;
responsible for slower growth in fertilizer consumption during early seven-&#13;
ties (see table 5). However, a careful analysis of the data in Table 5&#13;
does not support this contention. The correlation coefficient between annual&#13;
growth rate and closing stock is only 0.43. Only in 1973-74 the closing&#13;
stocks decreased to 5% of the total consumption of nitrogen. Moreover, it is&#13;
not clear whether India should keep reserves in excess of 10% of the total&#13;
consumption as an inventory.   It is obvious that fertilizers must be there&#13;
(in the villages) in order to use them. However, fertilizers were not iTI&#13;
inadequate supplies in the past at the aggregate level. It is possible that&#13;
these fertilizers were not adequately distributed among the villagers, and&#13;
also, not at the right time. Given that supplies are adequate to meet&#13;
current demand, an inequitable and untimely distribution of them might create&#13;
artificial shortages. Hence, the development of retail networks and transpor-&#13;
tation facilities should help in widening the narrow base of fertilizer&#13;
consumption. The success of the Intensive Fertilizer Promotion Programs, in&#13;
selected districts, along with decreases in prices in 1975-76 and 1976-77&#13;
indicates that the extension efforts and distribution facilities should&#13;
receive as much priority as irrigation, credit and HYVs in promoting fer-&#13;
tilizer consumption. M6reover, as nearly two-thirds of the fertilizer&#13;
consumption is accounted for by 25% (of 380) districts, and as these dis-&#13;
tricts are reaching near saturation levels in fertilizer consumption, further&#13;
growth in fertilizer consumption has to come about by widening the base, i.e.&#13;
by diffusing and distributing fertilizers to low-consumption districts&#13;
through the development of the fertilizer logistics.&#13;
3.2.      Fertilizer Consumption Forecasts&#13;
Forecasting the demand for fertilizer nutrients is crucial not&#13;
only for the agricultural sector because of the latter's dependence on&#13;
fertilizers for future development but also for the correct investment&#13;
decisions in the fertilizer industry itself. Incorrect forecasts might&#13;
result either in shortages for the farmers or-in excess capacity and low&#13;
profits for the producers. Inspite of the critical role played by the future&#13;
projections, a suitable forecasting methodology based on realistic behavioral&#13;
assumptions is still lacking.&#13;

Various agencies, like the Fertilizer Association of India, The&#13;
World Bank, The Planning Commission, and The National Commission on Agri-&#13;
culture, and the Ministry of Agriculture have projected the consumption of&#13;
fertilizer nutrients by using different approaches but none of them has&#13;
developed a behavioral model for the fertilizer sector.&#13;
Table 3.15 presents forecasts for 1978-79 by various authors.&#13;
The total NPK consumption forecasts vary between 4.15 and 8.00 million tons.&#13;
Similarly, there are wide variations among various forecasts for different&#13;
nutrients. Donde and Brown estimated a demand of 4 - 5.15 million tons for N&#13;
and 2 - 2.62 m tons for P 0   in 1978-79.   Against this, the Parikh-Srinvisasan&#13;
optimal requirements for A and P 205 are, respectively, 2.17 and 1.69 million&#13;
tons. For potassic fertilizers, K 20, the Planning Commission projections are&#13;
lowest while the Parikh-Srinivasan estimates are highest. The National&#13;
Commission on Agriculture has provided three sets of demand forecasts based&#13;
on different assumptions 1/ for 1978-79. These forecasts are middle range&#13;
projections compared with other estimates in Table 3.15.&#13;
Now, we discuss the underlying assumptions and methodologies of&#13;
these projections in detail.&#13;
3.2.1.    The Donde-Brown Forecasts&#13;
W. B. Donde of the Government of India, and Dorris D. Brown of the&#13;
World Bank have developed a regression model to predict future demand for&#13;
fertilizer nutrients. They specified two sets of equations. In one set, the&#13;
total quantity consumed of nitrogen and phosphate was regressed on the rupee&#13;
expenditures on fertilizers in the previous year (Ft 1) irrigated and un-&#13;
irrigated area under Kharif and Rabi crops. In the second set of equations,&#13;
the rupee value of crop output per hectare in the previous year (G     1) was&#13;
added to other independent variables of the first set. The inclusion of&#13;
F    is justified, by the authors, on the basis of the 'learning curve'&#13;
t- 1&#13;
concept.&#13;
The districts were 'divided into ten groups on the basis of cropping&#13;
pattern, rainfall and per hectare fertilizer consumption. Both sets of&#13;
equations were estimated by using the pooled cross-section and time-series&#13;
district data for each group, but the results of the first set of equations&#13;
were used in the projections for two reasons: first, the estimated coef-&#13;
ficients of C     were not statistically significant; and second, the pre-&#13;
dictive power oi the second equation was generally lower than that of the&#13;
first equation.   Table 3.16 presents their estimated equations for different&#13;
groups.&#13;
By using the. ten year growth rates of Ft i   irrigated and un-&#13;
irrigated area under Kharif and Rabi seasons, the future values of these&#13;
explanatory variables were projected. The projected values of these&#13;
1/   See below for details.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

variables along with their estimated regression coefficients were used to&#13;
forecast the demand for fertilizers (N+P 20 ).   These projections are termed&#13;
as Projection II (in Table 3.17) by the authors. Their Projection I set is&#13;
based on a simple extrapolation of the past-growth rate of fertilizer con-&#13;
sumption between 1959-60 and 1968-69, which was 28.0%, applied to future&#13;
years. The third set of projections is based on the subjective judgments of&#13;
the authors in adjusting the estimated coefficients and the observed growth&#13;
rates of independent variables for each district and every state in the&#13;
country. The national aggregates were derived by summing up the state level&#13;
projections for N and P 0 . Between 1973-74 and 1978-79, a compound growth&#13;
rate of 12.0 was assumea to make projections for 1978-79.&#13;
Predicting future accurately is the most difficult job confronting&#13;
the human mind. Different attempts try to minimize the prediction errors&#13;
in their projections. If one considers a 5 percent prediction error as a&#13;
plausible and tolerable error, the Donde-Brown model does not perform well at&#13;
the state as well as national level for 1973-74 (tables 3.17 &amp; 3.18).     Since&#13;
1973-74 was a normal year, an error of more than 5 percent in the forecasts&#13;
for this year would cast doubts on the validity of the model as a tool for&#13;
predicting the future consumption of fertilizer nutrients.&#13;
Similarly, the Donde-Brown forecasts for 1978-79 are unrealisti-&#13;
cally very high. In 1977-78, the consumption of nitrogen and phosphate&#13;
is, respectively, 2.9 and 0.87 million tons.    One has to assume an unrealis-&#13;
tically high growth rate of 35 to 100 percent between 1977-78 and 1978-79, to&#13;
attain the lower bounds of the Donde-Brown forecasts.&#13;
The model has ignored some of the important economic variables&#13;
influencing fertilizer consumption.    The relationship between fertilizer&#13;
prices and quantity consumed is conspicuously absent. Moreover, the com-&#13;
plementarities between fertilizers and HYVs are inadequately specified.&#13;
Econometrically, the use of ordinary least squares method yields inconsistent&#13;
results when cross-section and time-series data are used in estimating the&#13;
parameters. 1/&#13;
A properly specified and correctly estimated behavioral model of&#13;
fertilizer consumption may prove a useful tool for forecasting the demand for&#13;
fertilizer nutrient.&#13;
3.2.2.    The Planning Commission, and the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Irrigation Projections.&#13;
The Planning Commission of India has projected the demand for&#13;
fertilizers in 1978-79 as 8 million tons in the Draft: 5th Five Year Plan.&#13;
1/   Balestra, P. and M. Nerlov, "Pooling Cross-Section and Time Series Data&#13;
in the Estimation of a Dynamic Model: The Demand for Natural Gas,"&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Since these forecasts were made before the increase in prices of all nutrients&#13;
resulting from the global energy as well as fertilizer crisis, the Planning&#13;
Commission has revised its projection in 1976 when the Fifth Plan was finalized.&#13;
The new projections indicate a future demand of 4.8 million tons in 1978-79&#13;
and 8 million tons in 1983-84 (Table 3.15). The basis for these projections&#13;
is stated by the Planning Commission as follows:&#13;
"For projecting fertilizer demand, a careful attempt has been&#13;
made to isolate the expansion that would be necessitated on&#13;
account of increased emphasis on irrigation facilities and on&#13;
the spread of new technology, particularly to new areas.&#13;
Studies made indicate that fertilizer use is highly sensitive&#13;
to the availability of irrigation facilities, as also to&#13;
the spread of new technology. These shift factors have&#13;
been taken into account as also a moderate increase in dosages,&#13;
under each category of land. Such analysis has been conducted&#13;
crop by crop and total fertilizer requirements estimated." 1/&#13;
As the consumption of fertilizer nutrients in 1977-78 is estimated&#13;
around 4.3 million tons, a target of 4.8 million tons could be achieved in&#13;
1978-79. However, as the new Five Year Plan (1978-83) has replaced the last&#13;
year of the 5th Plan, a target consumption of 7.8 million tons of NPK nut-&#13;
rients is aimed for 1982-83, implying an increase of 3.5 million tons over&#13;
1977-78 level. Since the fertilizer consumption has increased by 18% in&#13;
1976-77 over 1975-76 level, and by 26% in 1977-78 over the previous year's&#13;
level, an annual compound growth rate of 13% implied by the plan targets&#13;
should not be difficult to achieve over the next five years.&#13;
The Working Group on the Development of the Fertilizer Industry&#13;
for the period 1978-79 to 1987-88, headed by Mr. S.M. Kelkar, Joint Secretary,&#13;
Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers has made projections of demand for N&#13;
and P 05 by assuming a compound growth rateof, respectively, 8% and 12% after&#13;
1983-4 on the basis of the Planning Commission's projections. The projected&#13;
demand for N and P205 in 1987-88 is, respectively, 7.075 and 2.50 million&#13;
tons (Table 3.18A).&#13;
The Ministry of Agriculture has also projected a demand of 5.0&#13;
to 5.2 million tons of nitrogen and 1.67 to 1.72 m tons of P. 0   for 1982-83.&#13;
Their projections for 1987-88 for N and P 20  are, respectiveiy, 6.12 to 6.25&#13;
and 2.45 to 2.50 million tons.&#13;
3.2.3     The Parikh-Srinivasan Optimum Requirements&#13;
Kirit S. Parikh and T. N. Srinivasan of the Indian Statistical&#13;
Institute, New Delhi have developed a quadratic programming model to estimate the&#13;
requirement of fertilizer nutrients in such a way that the total cost of&#13;

India, New Delhi, 1976. pp. 28.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
fertilizers to produce a given level of agricultural output is minimized. 1/&#13;
For the purposes of this model, the country was divided into 57 agro-climatic&#13;
zones based on soil characteristics, rainfall, cropping pattern etc. For&#13;
each zone, the fertilizer response functions for differenttypes of local and&#13;
high yielding varieties of wheat, barley, maize, rice, jowar, bajra, cotton,&#13;
groundnut and gram were estimated by using the data available from the Simple&#13;
Fertilizer Trials on the cultivator's farms in 1968-69, 1969-70, and 1970-71.&#13;
The dominant variety, namely, the variety whose response curve lay above that of all&#13;
others, was chosen for each crop in every zone. The dominant variety res-&#13;
ponse functions were scaled for each state to produce the 1970-71 level of&#13;
nitrogen consumption given the actual consumption of P 205 and K20 in that&#13;
year.&#13;
Using the Fifth Plan (Draft) targets for agricultural output,&#13;
area sown, area irrigated and area under high yielding varieties for each&#13;
crop in each state as given, the model estimated the optimum requirements of&#13;
N, P 20 and K 20 as 2.17, 1.69 and 2.60 million tons (see Table 3.19) to meet&#13;
these Largets at a minimum cost of fertilizers. Because of the diminishing&#13;
returns to fertilizer nutrients and relatively lower prices of K20, the model&#13;
suggests that higher amounts of P 205 and K 20 relative to N would be optimum.&#13;
In one variant of the model, when the ratios of P 0   and K 20 to&#13;
N are fixed at the Fifth Plan (Draft) level for each crop, {he optimum re-&#13;
quirements of N, P205 and K20 change respectively to 4.3, 1.7 and 1.1 million&#13;
tons.  In another version, when these ratios are fixed at the 1971-72 observed&#13;
levels for all crops, the optimum requirements become 4.6 m tons of N, 1.5 m&#13;
tons of P 205 and 0.8 million tons of K 0. The total requirements of NPK&#13;
in these versions of the model are 6.49, 7.08 and 6.85 million tons of&#13;
fertilizer nutrients.&#13;
Since the data used in estimating the response functions for&#13;
different varieties of various crops do not represent the conditions pre-&#13;
vailing on an average cultivator's farm in India, the optimum requirements&#13;
might differ from actually realiseables due to imperfect knowledge. However,&#13;
this model does indicate an important area in which the efforts to increase&#13;
fertilizer consumption may be concentrated. That area is: diffusion of&#13;
information and knowledge among the farmers about the dominant varieties of&#13;
different crops.&#13;
3.2.4     The National Commission on Agriculture Projections&#13;
The National Commission on Agriculture has estimated the future&#13;
demand for fertilizers by using several different methods (Table 3.20).&#13;
Various estimates indicate the consumption of fertilizers between 4 and 5&#13;
million tons of nutrients for 1978-79 and approximately six million tons for&#13;
1984-85.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Since the plants require nitrogen, phosphate, potash and other&#13;
micro nutrients for their growth, the depletion of these nutrients from the&#13;
soil requires their replenishment. The Commission estimated that the food-&#13;
grain and non-foodgrain crops had removed 12.38 million tons of N, P 05 and&#13;
K 0 from the soil in 1970-71.    Against this, the total consumption or&#13;
chemical fertilizers was 2.26 m tons in that year. Hence, 9.12 million&#13;
tons of nutrients were supplied by the soil. Similarly in 1960-61, the&#13;
supply of nutrients by the soil was approximately 9.26 million tons. Thus,&#13;
the capacity of the soil to provide nutrients for crop production can be&#13;
assumed approximately equal to 9 million tons. The Commission further&#13;
estimated that given the targets of crop output for 1978-79 and 1980-81, the&#13;
soil will be depleted of its nutrients to the extent of 16.35 and 18.12&#13;
million tons in these years (see Table 3.21). Since a part of these nut-&#13;
rients will be provided by the crop residue, legume, alagae and bacteria, the&#13;
entire amount of nutrients removed need not be replenished. During 1969-71&#13;
period, the fertilizers added to supply nutrients constituted on an average&#13;
about 55% N, 45% P 0 and 5% K 0, and 25% of total N + P 0 + K 0 removed by&#13;
cros.  erapsdu~to         t2 o                        2 5    2&#13;
crops.  Perhaps,due to scarcity of fertilizers, the observed demand may be&#13;
less than the optimum. By assuming that 60% N, 50% P 205 and 10% K 20 of the&#13;
quantities of each removed from the soil will be demanded in the late se-&#13;
venties and early eighties, the Commission projected a total demand of 5.28&#13;
million tons in 1978-79, and 6.0 million tons in 1984-85. The projection of&#13;
6 million tons of demand for fertilizers in 1984-85 by the nutrient removal&#13;
method equals the projections based on an extrapolation of a linear trend of&#13;
fertilizer consumption between 1967-68 and 1973-74. However, these two&#13;
methods yield significantly different results for 1978-79 (see Table 3.20).&#13;
Another method used by the Commission to estimate the demand for&#13;
fertilizers is based on the recommendations of the soil scientists and&#13;
agronomists about the optimum dose of N, P 05 and K20 for different crops.&#13;
By applying the recommended doses of ferti izers to the area under HYVs and&#13;
local varieties of seeds as well as area under irrigation and dry farming for&#13;
important food and nonfood crops, the Commission estimated a total demand of&#13;
8.50 m tons of nutrients in 1978-79 (Table 3.22). Since this figure appeared&#13;
unrealistically high, and the observed doses were significantly below the&#13;
recommended ones in 1973-74, the Commission adjusted the estimates of this&#13;
method by uniformly scaling them down to 55 percent for each nutrient. Thus,&#13;
the adjusted demand for fertilizers in 1978-79 is 4.67 million tons (see&#13;
Table 3.20).&#13;
Finally, the Commission estimated the marginal product of ferti-&#13;
lizers by linearly regressing the foodgrains output on the consumption of&#13;
fertilizers between 1966-67 and 1971-72. The slope of the regression line,&#13;
i.e., increase in crop output per unit of fertilizer consumption, was esti-&#13;
mated as 17 for foodgrain crops and 23 for all crops. Since this approach&#13;
overestimates the contribution of fertilizers to total crop output, the&#13;
Commission selected a value of 13, and projected the demand for fertilizers&#13;
as 4.84 million tons in 1978-79.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.2.5.    The FAI Projections&#13;
The Fertilizer Association of India, New Delhi has tried to fore-&#13;
cast the demand for fertilizers by fitting a quadratic equation to the time&#13;
series of fertilizer consumption between 1961-62 and 1976-77, (except 1972-73,&#13;
73-74 and 1974-75 for N, and 1974-75 and 1975-76 both for P 20    and K 2o).&#13;
Table 3.23 presents the projections of fertilizer demand for ?976-77 to&#13;
1987-88 period by this method along with actual consumption for 1976-77 and&#13;
1977-78. A comparison of the projections with actuals for 1976-77 and&#13;
1977-78 indicate a very close approximation for total (NPK) consumption with&#13;
an error of 4 to 9 percent. It is rather interesting to note this method&#13;
overestimated the consumption needs in 1976-77 whereas in 1977-78, it con-&#13;
sistantly underestimated. Since these are only two observations, it is hard&#13;
to evaluate the performance of the model. Although model does not have&#13;
parameters which can be modified and corrected for changes in exogencous&#13;
conditions, it is a simple, but elegant, model to provide reasonable fore-&#13;
casts of future fertilizer consumption levels.&#13;
The FAI projections for 1982-83 are 7.2 million tons which are&#13;
considerably below the targets set by the Planning Commission.&#13;
3.2.6     The NCAER Projections&#13;
The National Council of Applied Economic Research, New Delhi is&#13;
currently engaged in making projections for fertilizer nutrients by using&#13;
(i) cropping pattern method, and (ii) econometric method. The cropping&#13;
pattern method derives the forecasts of fertilizer nutrients by using the&#13;
projected fertilized area under different crops by the Ministry of Agricul-&#13;
ture and the average per hectare consumption of fertilizer nutrients on the&#13;
fertilized land for 1975-76 and 1976-77 (available from the survey of 22,000&#13;
cultivating households). Some surveys by the Indian Council of Agricultural&#13;
Research have revealed that fertilizer consumption per hectare of the fer-&#13;
tilized land (i.e. fertilizer intensity) has remained constant over time.&#13;
Consequently, the increased fertilizer consumption over time has come through&#13;
the extension of cultivated land under fertilizers as well as the diffusion&#13;
of fertilizers among small and medium farmers. The NCAER surveys have&#13;
revealed that nearly 55% of the cultivating households do not use fertilizers&#13;
while the unfertilized land constitutes nearly 67% of the total cultivated&#13;
land. On the other hand, the per hectare consumption of fertilizer on fer-&#13;
tilized land is reasonably high - about 78 kgs for the country as a whole.&#13;
Assuming that the observed levels of per hectare fertilizer use in 1975-76&#13;
and 1976-77 will remain stable, while the future efforts in fertilizer&#13;
promotion may result into extended area under fertilizers, one might forecast&#13;
the fertilizer consumption by multiplying the 1975-76 and 1976-77 average per&#13;
hectare consumption by the projected fertilized areas under different crops.&#13;
The Council has not explained the methodology underlying the projections of&#13;
fertilized area under different crops.&#13;
Another method used by the Council is based on the microeconomic&#13;
theory of production function and profit maximization. In order to maximize&#13;
profits, a farmer will use fertilizers in such a way that at margin the cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
of an additional kilogram of fertilizer nutrients is equal to the value of&#13;
additional crop output derived from that extra kilogram of fertilizer nutri-&#13;
ents. Furthermore, the use of fertilizers also depends on the availability&#13;
of water (irrigation) and the use of technology (HYVs or traditional seeds).&#13;
This kind of behavioral model, where fertilizer consumption depends&#13;
on fertilizer prices, irrigation ratio and areas under HYVs, is estimated by&#13;
using regression analysis. The estimated coefficients of control variables&#13;
(prices, irrigation etc) are used in making forecasts. Since the model can&#13;
be estimated by using time-series as well as cross-section data, it is not&#13;
clear what sort of data would be used by the Council. However, this being a&#13;
behavioral model, it would allow the planners to make plausible forecasts by&#13;
manipulating the control variables.&#13;
As the Council has not made forecasts by using these approaches,&#13;
the relative performance of these can not be evaluated ex-ante. It is&#13;
expected that the Council will make the forecasts of fertilizer nutrients&#13;
available sometime in near future.&#13;
4.0 Capacity, Production, Imports and Raw Materials&#13;
Fertilizer consumption in India had grown rapidly in the past and&#13;
is likely to grow severalfold in the future. Increased demand for any&#13;
commodity in general, and that for fertilizer nutrients in particular, can be&#13;
met either by imports or by indigenous production. Availability of foreign&#13;
exchange determines the capacity to import. Scarcity of foreign exchange in&#13;
India prompted the planners to build adequate capacity for fertilizer produc-&#13;
tion. Although single super-phosphate (SSP) was manufactured in India as&#13;
early as 1906, and ammonium sulphate in 1933, the large scale production of&#13;
nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers started only after 1947, and spurted&#13;
in the sixties and seventies.&#13;
In 1950, India had an installed capacity of 37.2 thousand tons:&#13;
16.7 thousand tons of N and 20.5 thousand tons of P 205. Fertilizers and&#13;
Chemicals Travancore Ltd, Alwaye (Kerala) was the only large factory with a&#13;
capacity of 10 thousand tons of N and 8.5 thousand tons of P205. The Sindri&#13;
Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd started a factory at Sindri, Bihar, in 1951 to&#13;
produce ammonium sulphate. Expansion of other public projects in the fifties&#13;
increased the installed capacity to 162.2 thousand tons of N and 96 thousand&#13;
tons of P205 in 1960. Efforts by the Government of India during the Third&#13;
Plan and thereafter, and the investment by the producers during late sixties&#13;
and early seventies enhanced the installed capacity by nearly twenty-fold for&#13;
N and ten-folds for P205 between 1960 and 1976. By 1982-83, the installed&#13;
capacity for N and P205 is likely to be 6.11 and 1.43 million tons respec-&#13;
tively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Like installed capacity, fertilizer production also witnessed&#13;
severalfold increases in the sixties and seventies. In 1952-53, approxi-&#13;
mately 53 thousand tons of N and 7.4 thousand tons of P 205 were produced.&#13;
Against this, nitrogen output increased to 2.00 million tons in 1977-78,&#13;
while P205 production reached 670 thousand tons in the same year. In the&#13;
next five years (1978-83), output of N and P205 is expected to double to&#13;
4.1 and 1.125 m tons respectively. 1/&#13;
In the fifties and early sixties, ammonium sulphate and single&#13;
super-phosphate were the main nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers produced&#13;
in the country. Urea and complex fertilizers have occupied the dominant&#13;
position in the seventies. Approximately, three quarters of the nitrogen was&#13;
produced in the form of urea in 1976-77. Similarly, a little less than&#13;
three-fourths of P 205 was manufactured in the form of NP/NPK complex fer-&#13;
tilizers.&#13;
In the field of raw materials, naphtha occupies an important&#13;
place in nitrogen production, accounting for about 70% of the installed&#13;
capacity. The discoveries of petroleum crude at Bombay High will increase&#13;
the use of natural gas as a feedstock in the near future. Also, India is&#13;
constructing two plants using coal as a feedstock for nitrogen production.&#13;
On the other hand, the discoveries of rockphosphate deposits in Udaipur&#13;
(Rajasthan), Jhabua (M.P.), Mussori (U.P.), and Purulia (West Bengal) dis-&#13;
tricts might save foreign exchange used in importing rockphosphate for P 205&#13;
production,   and enhance P 205 output in the eighties.&#13;
Approximately one-fourth of the nitrogenous and phosphatic fertil-&#13;
izer requirements are met through imports. As there are no known reserves&#13;
of potash in India, all of the potassic fertilizers requirements are, and&#13;
will continue to be, met through imports.&#13;
4.1 Capacity&#13;
4.1.1      Installed Capacity&#13;
Although fertilizer production was started in India in 1906 (SSP)&#13;
and 1933 (ammonium sulphate) by using the by-product COG of the steel plant&#13;
(TISCO), the total installed capacity was insignificantly small. In December&#13;
1950, India had an installed capacity of 37.2 thousand tons: 16.7 thousand&#13;
tons of N and 20.5 thousand tons of P205. Fertilizers and Chemicals Travan-&#13;
core Ltd., Alwaye (Kerala) was the only large factory with a capacity of&#13;
10,000 tons of N and 8,500 tons of P205 in 1950. It used wood-gasification&#13;
process to produce ammonia.&#13;

In 1951, another factory was set up in Sindri, Bihar to produce&#13;
ammonium sulphate by using coke and gypsum. During the first two Five Year&#13;
Plans, the installed capacity increased to 248 thousand tons of N and 120&#13;
thousand tons of P 0 . This was achieved by expanding the installed capaci-&#13;
ties of three public sector and one private sector factories. Product&#13;
diversification was also achieved during this decade on the recommendations&#13;
of the Mukherjee Committee and the Ranganathan Delegation. Urea, nitropho-&#13;
sphate, CAN and ammonium phosphate were introduced into the planning stream&#13;
in the late fifties.&#13;
The need to increase food production and reduce dependence on&#13;
imports of food and fertilizers motivated the Government to increase in-&#13;
stalled capacity and production of fertilizers during the Third Five Year&#13;
Plan.  As a result of the conscious efforts by the Government of India, the&#13;
installed capacity increased to 525 thousand tons of N and 264 thousand tons&#13;
of P 0 by September 1966 (Table 4.1). Major projects taken up during the&#13;
Third Plan were FCI's 1/ Trombay unit (producing urea and nitrophosphate),&#13;
Neyveli (Tamil Nadu) unit, Rourkela (Hindustan Steel Ltd.) unit for CAN from&#13;
coke-oven-gas of steel plant and the expansion of FACT 2/, Alwaye (Kerala) to&#13;
produce ammonium phosphate. During the three annual plans (1966-67 to&#13;
1968-69), the Gujarat State Fertilizer Co., near Boarda, Coromandel Fer-&#13;
tilizers in Vishakhapatnam and Shriram Chemical Industries at Kota (Rajasthan)&#13;
were commissioned. Consequently, the installed capacity of nitrogen increas-&#13;
ed by 732% from 162 thousand tons in 1960 to 1346 thousand tons of N in 1970.&#13;
Similarly, the P205 capacity increased by 352% - from 96 thousand tons in&#13;
1960 to 434 thousand tons in 1970.&#13;
Partly due to the success achieved during the sixties in building&#13;
capacity and partly because of the increased demand for fertilizers as a&#13;
consequence of the Green Revolution in agriculture, along with irrigation&#13;
development and extension efforts, the Government of India decided to build&#13;
additional capacity for fertilizer production during the 4th Plan period&#13;
(1969-74). The Indian Explosives Ltd., Panki (UP), Madras Fertilizers&#13;
Ltd., Manali (Tamil Nadu), FACT's Cochin, FCI's Durgapur, Namrup, Barauni and&#13;
Gorakhpur, and Zuari Agro-Chemicals, Goa were the major plants that went on&#13;
stream during the Fourth Plan period. The Indian Farmers Fertilizer Coopera-&#13;
tive started production in 1974 at Kandla and Kalol and initiated the construc-&#13;
tion of another unit at Phulpur (U.P.). The New Fertilizer Policy of 1965&#13;
removed the ambiguity of the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, regarding&#13;
the private investment in the fertilizer sector, and therefore, encouraged&#13;
private investment in fertilizer industry. Mainly medium size plants were&#13;
constructed by the private investors to produce NP and NPK fertilizers. As&#13;
a result of all these efforts, the installed capacity increased to 3.03&#13;
million tons of N and 0.92 million tons of P205 in October 1978. The Draft&#13;
Five Year Plan, 1978-83 has laid down a target capacity of 6.11 million tons&#13;
of N and 1.43 million tons of P205 by 1982-83.&#13;

Table 4.2 indicates the existing as well as planned capacity on&#13;
N and P20 according to end-products. Nearly three-fourths of the present N&#13;
capacity Is in the form of urea. The additional capacity of 4.2 million tons&#13;
of N is to be created in the near future; of which, 2.1 m tons is under&#13;
implementation and another 2.1 m tons has already been approved in principle.&#13;
This additional capacity will be available mostly in the form of urea, and a&#13;
small part in the form of nitrophosphate and NPK complex fertilizers. It is&#13;
interesting to note that no additional capacity will be built for ammonium&#13;
sulphate and calcium ammonium nitrate, the two important products of the&#13;
sixties (see below).&#13;
In the field of P205, an additional capacity of 396 thousand&#13;
tons of P 20 is under implementation, and another 174 thousand tons of&#13;
P 0 capacity has been approved in principle. Nearly nine-tenths of the&#13;
additional capacity of ?2°0 under implementation will be available in the&#13;
form of TSP (triple superphosphate) and nitrophosphate and about one-tenth&#13;
through complex fertilizers, whereas the capacity approved in principle will&#13;
be available mostly in the form of NP/NPK complex fertilizers. Thus, TSP and&#13;
complex fertilizers will dominate single superphosphate in additional capacity&#13;
build-ups for P 205. Recently, the Government of India has reversed its&#13;
earlier policy of non-approval of SSP plants in future P 205 capacity build-&#13;
ups by approving 4 SSP plants. 1/&#13;
4.1.2      Sectorwise Capacity&#13;
The Government of India took an active part in investing, and&#13;
in building capacity, in fertilizer industry in the fifties and sixties.&#13;
Two factories, namely, FACT at Alwaye (Kerala) and FCI, at Sindri (Bihar)&#13;
were public sector undertakings. Perhaps, due to the ambiguity of the&#13;
Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, private investors did not invest in the&#13;
fertilizer sector until mid-sixties. The New Fertilizer Policy of 1965&#13;
removed this ambiguity, and encouraged private investment. Thus, till early&#13;
sixties, private sector's contribution was insignificant. Furthermore,&#13;
fertilizer industry was included in the list of key industries which led to&#13;
heavy public investment in this sector. Consequently, 51% of the existing&#13;
capacity of N was under public control and 42% under private ownership in&#13;
1977 (Table 4.3). Although the cooperative sector controls a relatively&#13;
small portion of the existing capacity, its share is likely to increase&#13;
significantly. The Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative (cooperative&#13;
factory) has plants in Kandla and Kalol (Gujarat), is constructing one at&#13;
Phulpur (U.P.) with the help of a World Bank loan, and has plans to build&#13;
another plant near Ahmedabad (Gujarat). With regards to the projects under&#13;
implementation, 76% of the capacity is being build-up in the public sector,&#13;
and 24% in private and cooperative sectors, each contributing nearly half.&#13;
1/   Mr. G. Sobhti of the FAI, New Delhi informed us about this change in&#13;
policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
If the projects, approved in principle, are also included, the share of&#13;
public sector will increase to 58%. Thus, a significant part of the addi-&#13;
tional capacity of nitrogen will be constructed under public control.&#13;
What is true for nitrogen also holds for phosphate (P 20 ). The&#13;
public sector controls 37% of the existing capacity of P 05 and its share&#13;
will increase to 50% after the projects under implementation and the projects&#13;
approved in principle are completed. On the other hand, the share of private&#13;
sector will decrease from 49% in 1977 to 39% in early eighties.&#13;
Taken together, public sector will control little less than two-&#13;
thirds of the capacity in the fertilizer industry in early eighties.&#13;
4.1.3     Regional Distribution of Licensed Capacity&#13;
In a country of the sub-continent size, like India, an equitable&#13;
regional distribution of productive forces is necessary not only for poli-&#13;
tical stability but also for greater economic efficiency in order to reduce&#13;
shipment and transportation costs. Tables 4.4 and 4.5 indicate the zonewise&#13;
and statewise distribution of fertilizer capacity in India. In the field of&#13;
nitrogen, south zone had an installed capacity of 1 million tons, accounting&#13;
for nearly one-third of the total capacity in production in 1977-78. East&#13;
and west zones, each accounted for little less than one-fourth of the total&#13;
capacity,while central and north zones, taken together, contributed about&#13;
one-fifth of the installed capacity in 1977-78.&#13;
A state-wise comparison reveals that four states, namely, Tamil&#13;
Nadu, Gujarat, U.P. and Kerala had approximately one-half of the total&#13;
capacity in production. Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, the three&#13;
largest states in the country, accounted for less than one-tenth of the total&#13;
capacity of nitrogen in 1977-78. Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and other hill&#13;
states do not have any installed capacity. Each of the remaining states in&#13;
India contributed between 2% to 7% of the nitrogen capacity. Like the&#13;
consumption of fertiizer nutrients, installed capacity of nitrogen is also&#13;
concentrated in a few states.&#13;
As on January 1, 1978 Punjab and Haryana accounted for little less&#13;
than 3% of the existing capacity and had projects under construction account-&#13;
ing for nearly 30% of the additional capacity under construction. As the&#13;
expansion of the Nangal unit was completed in July 1978, Punjab's capa-&#13;
city increased from 80 thousand tons to 232 thousand tons. The completion of&#13;
the National Fertilizer's Bhatinda unit in December 1978 has added another&#13;
235 thousand tons to Punjab's existing capacity of 232 thousand tons.&#13;
Similarly, Haryana has an installed capacity of 235 thousand tons because&#13;
the Panipat unit of National Fertilizers has been commissioned in December&#13;
1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Three states in east zone, namely Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal,&#13;
account for nearly one-fourth of the new capacity under construction.&#13;
Modernization of the FCI's Sindri (Bihar) unit, and the construction of the&#13;
two new units, one at Talchar (Orissa) and another at Haldia (West Bengal)&#13;
will increase the capacity of east zone by 510 thousand tons by the end of&#13;
1979. Similarly, the completion of IFFCO's Phulpur unit in 1979 will enhance&#13;
the nitrogen capacity of U.P. (Central Zone) by 228 thousand tons, whereas&#13;
the expansion of the FCI's Trombay IV and V units will increase Maharashtra's&#13;
nitrogen capacity by 205 thousand tons in early 1980. 1/ Finally, the&#13;
expansion of the FACT, Cochin II (Kerala), and the construction of the FCI's&#13;
Ramagundam (Andhra Pradesh) unit will add 233 thousand tons of additional&#13;
capacity to south zone's existing capacity of 1 million tons of nitrogen.&#13;
The installed capacity for nitrogen is targeted to reach 6.11&#13;
million tons by the end of the present plan (1982-83).&#13;
Besides 2.1 million tons of additional capacity under construction,&#13;
India also has approved projects which, on completion, will increase N capa-&#13;
city by another 2.1 million tons in the mid-eighties. These new projects&#13;
will be located in Madhya Pradesh (Korba), Rajasthan (Kota), Orissa (Paradeep),&#13;
Andhra Pradesh (Kakinada) and Maharashtra (Thal Vaishet). Although the&#13;
implementation of the Korba (M.P.) unit is dependent on the success achieved&#13;
in operating coal based plants at Talchar (Orissa) and Ramagundam (Andhra&#13;
Pradesh), while that of Paradeep (Orissa) is contingent on striking of&#13;
natural gas in the Bay of Bengal (See Table 4.4). 2/ Recent approval of the&#13;
IEL's Kanpur unit's expansion will increase U.P's. installed capacity by 100&#13;
thousand tons.&#13;
Like nitrogen, phosphate fertilizers capacity is also highly&#13;
concentrated. Nearly four-fifths of the existing capacity is located in&#13;
West and South zones (Table 4.5). Furthermore, only four states, namely,&#13;
Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala account for about 75% of the&#13;
current installed capacity of 915 thousand tons of phosphate. West Bengal,&#13;
Bihar, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have projects under construction which will&#13;
increase the present capacity by 396 thousand tons by 1980. All these&#13;
projects are being implementated under public sector control. Three other&#13;
states, namely, Madhya Pradesh (Jhabua), Gujarat (Kandla) and Andhra Pradesh&#13;
(Kakinada), have approved projects for implementation in early eighties. The&#13;
completion of these projects will add another 174 thousand tons of capacity&#13;
to India's phosphate fertilizers industry. The installed capacity is expect-&#13;
ed to reach 1.43 million tons by 1982-83.&#13;

4.1.4     Capacity Utilization&#13;
Almost all industries in India suffer from low capacity utiliza-&#13;
tion 1/, and the fertilizer industry is no exception to that. Between&#13;
1970-71 and 1976-77, capacity utilization has varied-be'tween 58% and 71% for&#13;
nitrogen and between 45 and 66 percent for phosphate (Table 4.7). Power&#13;
failure and mechenical breakdowns are major factors contributing towards low&#13;
capacity  utilization.   An overall low capacity utilization for P 05 may&#13;
result from the fact that important raw materials used in manufacturing P205,&#13;
namely, rockphosphate and sulphur, are mostly imported in India. A sharp&#13;
increase in their prices in 1972-74 period contributed towards low capacity&#13;
utilization for P 0 5.  Lack of demand for P20, and difficulties in operating&#13;
phosphoric acid piants also deceJerate capacity utilization for P 05 plants.&#13;
Similarly, increased prices of petroleum products resulting from the ferti-&#13;
lizer crisis of the early seventies affected'N capacity utilization.&#13;
4.1.5     Capacity Utilization of N Plants&#13;
The Working Group on the Development of Fertilizer Industry has&#13;
divided the existing fertilizer plants into three broad categories, namely,&#13;
extremely old plants and those with built-in constraints, stabilized modern&#13;
plants, and new plants in the process of stabilization. Table 4.8 indicates&#13;
the classification of the existing fertilizer, plants into these three&#13;
categories for nitrogen. Of 24 plants, 8 plants belong to the first category&#13;
while 4 constitute the last category. These 12 plants have obviously very&#13;
low capacity utilization ranging between 35% and 50%. Learning by operating&#13;
the new plants embodying modern and complex technology of production is&#13;
expected to improve the capacity utilization of 4 new plants at Tuticorin,&#13;
Mangalore, Namrup expansion and Barauni. Corrective measures are being&#13;
taken to improve the capacity utilization of 8 plants belonging to the first&#13;
categoy. Sindri, Rourkela and Neyveli have obsolete technology as well as&#13;
feedstock. Modernization of Sindri plant will replace coke and COG by fuel&#13;
oil, and low-quality natural gypsum by high quality by-product phospho-gypsum&#13;
in the production of ammonium sulphate. The Rourkela plant is converted&#13;
from COG to naphtha-based facility. Similarly, the Neyveli plant is converted&#13;
to use fuel-oil as a feed-stock in place of its present use of poor quality&#13;
lignite. The Enmore unit of EID-Perry is being phased out of fertilizer&#13;
production and is being converted into methanol plant. The Durgapur 'and&#13;
Cochin plants are also being modified in order to optimize production. After&#13;
the modernization and/or rationalization of these six units, the capacity&#13;
utilization of these plants is expected to improve significantly. The&#13;
remaining two plants, viz, Varanasi and Undyogamandal will continue to have&#13;
low capacity utilization.&#13;
1/   See Bhagawati, J. and P. Desai.   India:  Planning for Industrialization.&#13;
Oxford University Press, 1970.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Plants belonging to the second category have operated at a rea-&#13;
sonably high level of capacity utilization. Between 1972-73 and 1976-77,&#13;
the aggregate capacity utilization of this group ranged between 70 and 84%.&#13;
Some of the plants have attained capacity level exceeding 90%. In 1976-77,&#13;
the Nangal, Trombay, Namrup and Kanpur plants utilized 94% to 126% of their&#13;
installed capacities.&#13;
Among stabilized plants, there are variations in the Levels of&#13;
capacity utilized, over time as well as across plants. These variations are&#13;
mainly due to mechanical breakdowns andYor power shortages. Table 4.9&#13;
indicates the loss of output due to mechanical breakdowns, power failures,&#13;
raw material difficulties and other minor factors. Mechanical break downs&#13;
were responsible for 80 to 90 percent of 340-370 thousand tons of nitrogen&#13;
output lost in 1975-76 and 1976-77. The total loss of output in these two&#13;
years was approximately one fifth of the total output. Power failures and&#13;
power cuts led to reduction in output by 50 to 130 thousand tons during&#13;
the last five years.&#13;
Better predictive and preventive maintenance, and inventory and&#13;
spares control can alone help reduce loss of output due to mechanical break-&#13;
downs. The present foreign exchange surplus in India should be utilized to&#13;
import parts and spares to improve capacity utilization. The construction of&#13;
captive power generating units at Trombay, Gorakhpur, Durgapur and Coromandel&#13;
should help prevent loss in nitrogen production due to power failures and&#13;
power cuts. Moreover, a better coordination between the State Electricity&#13;
Boards and Fertilizer units might avoid frequent power cuts.&#13;
The Working Group has suggested to supply ammonia from external&#13;
sources in order to improve capacity utilization. The Marathe Committee has&#13;
recommended a norm of 80% capacity utilization in order to ensure 12% return&#13;
on the net worth. For the new units, capacity utilization norms established&#13;
by the working group are 50%, 70% and 85% during the first, second, and third&#13;
(and thereafter) year of the commissioning of a new plant. For the coal&#13;
based plants, these norms are, respectively, 50%, 70%, and 80%.&#13;
4.1.6      Capacity Utilization of P40r Plants&#13;
Compared to nitrogenous fertilizer plants, capacity utilization&#13;
of phosphatic fertilizer plants is very low. During 1973-74 and 1976-77&#13;
period, capacity utilization varied between 46% and 66% (Table 4.7). High&#13;
prices of straight phosphatic fertilizers compared to complex fertilizers&#13;
were constraining the demand, and therefore, capacity utilization in P205&#13;
fertilizer plants. In March 1976, a subsidy of Rs. 1,250/- per ton of P205&#13;
was introduced to stimulate demand. Increased demand for P205 in 1976-77&#13;
also enhanced capacity utilization.&#13;
Table 4.10 indicates capacity utilization for various P205 plants&#13;
during 1973-74 and 1976-77 period. The Trombay and Ennore units have con-&#13;
sistantly maintained high levels of capacity utilization, whereas the Udyoga-&#13;
Mandal unit had always oprated at close to 50% of the installed capacity.&#13;
The Cochin, Baroda, Madras and Vizag units maintained an average of 60 to 70&#13;
percent of capacity utilization.&#13;

The inadequate supplies of raw materials, like rockphosphate and&#13;
sulphur, which are mostly imported, is another factor inhibiting high capacity&#13;
utilization levels. Furthermore, difficulties in operating phosphoric acid&#13;
plants have also contributed towards low capacity utilization in SSP plants.&#13;
The discovery and development of rockphosphate in Rajasthan should help in&#13;
improving capacity utilization by supplying indigenous rockphosphate.&#13;
4.2 Production of Fertilizer Nutrients&#13;
4.2.1     Chronology of Fertilizer Manufacture&#13;
Table 4.12 indicates the introduction of different fertilizer&#13;
products in India. Single superphosphate (SSP) was introduced in 1906,&#13;
whereas ammonium sulphate was manufactured, for the first time, in 1922.&#13;
These two products dominated the fertilizer production scene till 1959, when&#13;
urea, ammonium sulphate nitrate, and ammonium chloride entered the production&#13;
stream. Between 1960 and 1965, different units of the Fertilizer Corporation&#13;
of India, and Fertilizers and Chemicals, Travancore, Ltd., Alwaye (Kerala)&#13;
started manufacturing three fertilizers, namely, ammonium phosphate sulphate,&#13;
nitrophasphate, and calcium ammonium nitrate. Diammonium phosphate and&#13;
triple super-phosphate (TSP) were first produced in 1967 and 1968 respec-&#13;
tively. Other complex fertilizers, like urea ammonium phosphate and ammonium&#13;
phosphate sulphate nitrate were also introduced in 1968 by the FCI and&#13;
Coromandel Fertilizers, Ltd., Vizag (Andhra Pradesh). Thus, prior to 1960,&#13;
SSP and ammonium sulphate were main phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizers.&#13;
After 1960, urea and many NP and NPK complex fertilizers replaced these two&#13;
products.&#13;
4.2.2     Nutrientwise Production&#13;
Production of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers in India&#13;
has increased severalfold since 1952-53. Nitrogen production increased at a&#13;
compound rate of 17 percent per annum from 53.1 thousand tons in 1952-53 to&#13;
2.0 million tons in 1977-78 (Tables 4.13 and 4.14). Output of phosphatic&#13;
fertilizers grew at a compound rate of 17.6 percent per annum between 1952-&#13;
53 and 1977-78. In absolute terms, the P 0 output increased from 7.4&#13;
thousand tons in 1952-53 to 670.0 thousan3 Lons in 1976-77. The total&#13;
output of both nutrients maintained an annual compound growth rate of 16.4&#13;
percent during this period (Table 4.14). The New Five Year Plan, 1978-83&#13;
envisages to double the installed capacity for fertilizer production during&#13;
the next five years. Consequently, the production of N and P205 is expected&#13;
to reach 4.1 and 1.13 million tons in 1982-83.&#13;
Table 4.14 presents the data on growth rates of fertilizer produc-&#13;
tion for different sub-periods. Between 1952-53 and 1961-62, nitrogen pro-&#13;
duction increased at an annual compound rate of 12.6 percent while P205 out-&#13;
put maintained a compound growth rate of 27.4 percent per annum. Nitrogen&#13;
production grew at a faster rate in the sixties compared to fifties, whereas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
P20 output increased at a much slower pace in the sixties. In seventies,&#13;
prAouction of both nutrients recorded lower rates of growth compared to their&#13;
growth rates in the sixties, although the rate of growth of N production in&#13;
the seventies was higher than what it was in the fifties. A low rate of&#13;
growth of fertilizer production in the seventies might be due to global&#13;
energy and fertilizer crisis resulting into increased prices of imported raw&#13;
materials like sulphuric acid, rockphosphate and petroleum products used in&#13;
fertilizer production.&#13;
Table 4.15 indicates the annual percentage variations in fertilizer&#13;
production in India between 1961-62 and 1976-77. Nitrogen production has&#13;
varied between 11% and 39%, during 1961-62 to 1976-77 period except 1965-66&#13;
and 1973-74 when it decreased.   On the other hand, P205 output has fluctuated&#13;
annually in the range of 2% and 49%.&#13;
In 1976-77, production of N and P 205 increased, respectively,&#13;
by 23.1% and 49.4% over 1975-76 level. Decreased raw material prices,&#13;
improved power supply and labor relations, and increased demand for ferti-&#13;
lizer nutrients are considered to be the main contributory factors for this&#13;
increased level of fertilizer output. 1/&#13;
4.2.3     Regional Distribution of Fertilizer Production&#13;
Table 4.16 presents the data on zonewise and statewise production&#13;
of N and P 05 for different years. In 1970-71, U.P., Gujarat and Rajasthan&#13;
were the three top ranking states in the field of notrogen production,&#13;
whereas in 1976-77, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu displaced U.P. and Rajasthan,&#13;
respectively, to the third and fourth position in N production. Punjab,&#13;
Haryana, Karnataka, Goa and Assam do not produce significant amount of P 0&#13;
whereas the contribution of Delhi and Karnataka is nil in nitrogen produc-&#13;
tion.&#13;
Over time, production of nitrogeneous fertilizers has increased&#13;
significantly in U.P., Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Gujarat, West Bengal, and Kerala.&#13;
Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan have registered declines in their N&#13;
production between 1970-71 and 1975-76. Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra&#13;
presents a picture of stagnation, while Punjab could be described as unstable.&#13;
State level production of P 20 over time does not reveal any consistent&#13;
pattern. Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra contribute more&#13;
than 70 percent of the total P205 output in the country.&#13;
Zonewise analysis of production trends reveals that central,&#13;
east and west zones have increased their nitrogenous output uninterrupt-&#13;
edly during 1970-71 and 1976-77 period. Nitrogen production registered&#13;
decreases in 1974-75 in the south as well as north zones. South and west&#13;
zones have registered appreciable increases in P205 production.&#13;

Relative shares of different zones in fertilizer production have&#13;
changed considerably between 1967-68 and 1975-76 (Table 4.17). Central zone&#13;
produced about 2% of the total nitrogen output whereas north and east zones&#13;
contributed, respectively, 21% and 35% in 1967-68. Thus, more than half of&#13;
the total N production was concentrated in north and east zones. In 1977-78,&#13;
total share of east and north zones reduced to about 15% while central zone&#13;
increased its contribution to slightly more than one-fifth of total N produc-&#13;
tion in the country. South and west zones, taken together, have maintained&#13;
their share between 40 and 50 percent of total N production, and continue to&#13;
produce about 80 to 90 percent of total P205 output in the    country.  With&#13;
the discovery of rockphosphate in Udaipur district, Rajasthan, it is anti-&#13;
cipated that central zone may enhance its share in P205 production in the&#13;
future.&#13;
4.2.4     Product-Composition of Fertilizer Nutrients&#13;
Ammonium sulphate was the only source of nitrogen produced in&#13;
India in the fifties. During the Third Five Year Plan period, urea and&#13;
other straight nitrogenous fertilizer products were introduced. By 1967-68,&#13;
only 24 percent of the total nitrogen was produced in the form of ammonium&#13;
sulphate (Table 4.18). Urea and calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) accounted&#13;
for, respectively, one-fourth and one third of the total nitrogen production.&#13;
Thus, these three products supplied more than 80% of nitrogen produced in&#13;
India in 1967-68. NP and NPK complex fertilizers accounted for about 12&#13;
percent of the total N production.&#13;
Seventies saw another breakthrough in the technology of nitrogen&#13;
production. No further expansion of ammonium sulphate. In 1976-77, 71% of&#13;
nitrogen was produced in the form of urea. Ammonium sulphate and calcium&#13;
ammonium nitrate, which accounted for approximately 57 percent of nitrogen&#13;
produced in India in 1.967-68, contributed only about 15%. The share of&#13;
complex fertilizers did not change significantly between 1967-68 and 1976-77.&#13;
Perhaps, relatively lower distribution and transportation costs, and ease in&#13;
handling and storing have contributed towards increased production of urea&#13;
not only in India but all over the world during the seventies.&#13;
Like ammonium sulphate, single supper-phsophate (SSP) was the only&#13;
source of P205 till 1958-59 (Table 4.19). Even in the late sixties, SSP&#13;
accounted for nearly 72 percent of the total P205 produced in India.    After&#13;
1967-68, SSP's share in P 05 output declined significantly. In 1971-72,&#13;
SSP accounted for 43% of the total P 0 production; and its share decreased&#13;
to close to one-fourth in 1975-76 ang ?976-77. Urea-ammonium phosphate,&#13;
nitrophosphate, diammonium phosphate and ammonium-phosphate sulphate were&#13;
the other major products accounting for nearly 50% of P 205 production in&#13;
early seventies.  Although the contribution of these products has decreased&#13;
over time, yet they accounted for approximately 38% of P 0 output in 1976-77.&#13;
The complex fertilizers provided nearly 35 percent of P 2   'in 1976-77.&#13;
Thus, NP and NPK comp:Lex fertilizers contributed about three-fourth of the&#13;
total P20 output as against their very small contribution (less than 1.5%)&#13;
to nitrogen production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Thus, urea for nitrogen, and complex fertilizers for phosphate&#13;
are the major fertilizer products produced in India.&#13;
4.3 Fertilizer Imports&#13;
The Plantation Boards, who were the early users of chemical&#13;
fertilizers in India, met their fertilizer requirements through imports.&#13;
Sodium nitrate from Chile was imported as early as 1899. In 1942, the&#13;
Government of India launched the "Grow More Food Campaign," under which the&#13;
use of chemical fertilizers was accepted as an important means to augment&#13;
the food supply in the country. Also, the indigenous production of chemical&#13;
fertilizers to meet the domestic demand became the prime goal of the ferti-&#13;
lizer policy in the forties.   It was, however, decided that as long as the&#13;
indigenous production fell short of the domestic demand, imports would fill&#13;
the gap. Even today, "meeting the gap" (between consumption and production)&#13;
appears to be the core of the fertilizer import policy.&#13;
India imported 1.64 million tons of NPK fertilizer nutrients&#13;
in 1975-76 as against 47 thousand tons in 1952-53 (Table 4.26). The growth&#13;
of imports was rather slow in the fifties, accelerated in the sixties and&#13;
slowed down in the early seventies. With the introduction of the high-&#13;
yielding varieties of wheat and rice, the fertilizer imports increased&#13;
significantly in 1966-67 and thereafter. Along with the quantity, the value&#13;
of the imported fertilizers also increased appreciably in the mid-sixties.&#13;
The total value of imported fertilizer nutrients rose to Rs. 1,288.2 million&#13;
in 1966-67 as against Rs. 411.9 million in the previous year (Table 4.26).&#13;
The fertilizer crisis of the early seventies affected the cost&#13;
of imported fertilizers adversely for India. The total value of imports&#13;
increased from Rs. 899.7 m in 1971-72 to Rs. 7,227.7 m in 1975-76: an&#13;
eightfold increase, whereas the total quantity of imported fertilizers in-&#13;
creased by about 64% - from 997 thousand tons in 1971-72 to 1,635 thousand&#13;
tons in 1975-76. Thus, the average cost of each ton of imported fertilizer&#13;
was much higher in 1975-76 compared to what it was in 1971-72.&#13;
The main fertilizer products imported in India are urea, ammonium&#13;
sulphate, calcium ammonium nitrate, nitrophosphate, diammonium phosphate,&#13;
and muriate of potash. USA, UK, USSR, Japan, Germany (East and West),&#13;
Italy, Rumania, Poland and Quatar are the major exporters of fertilizer&#13;
products to India.&#13;
4.3.1      Import of Nitrogenous Fertilizers&#13;
Ammonium sulphate was the main nitrogenous fertilizer product&#13;
imported in the forties and early fifties. Urea, calcium ammonium nitrate&#13;
and ammonium sulphate provide approximately 90% of the currently imported&#13;
nitrogenous fertilizers in the country. USA, USSR, Italy, Holland, Poland,&#13;
Quatar and Kuwait are major fertilizer exporters to India. India also&#13;
imports complex fertilizers from West Germany, Italy, UK and USA (Tables&#13;
4.27 and 4.28).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
In absolute terms, the imports of nitrogenous fertilizers in-&#13;
creased from 44.0 thousand tons in 1952-53 to 996.0 thousand tons in 1975-76&#13;
(Table 4.26). Prior to 1960-61, India imported relatively small quantities&#13;
of nitrogenous fertilizers. With a targeted consumption of one million tons&#13;
of fertilizer nutrients during the Third Plan, India increased fertilizer&#13;
imports to 399 thousand tons in 1960-61 compared to 142 thousand tons in&#13;
the previous year. The introduction of high-yielding varieties in 1966-67&#13;
further boosted the fertilizer imports to 632 thousand tonis. Although there&#13;
was a significant decline in the imports of nitrogenous fertilizers in 1970-&#13;
71 and 1971-72, fertilizer imports have increased by 57% between 1966-67 and&#13;
1975-76.&#13;
Table 4.30 indicates the import of fertilizer materials. In&#13;
1967-68, approximately 1.05 million tons of ammonium sulphate and 0.92&#13;
million tons of urea were imported. Against this, 96 thousancl tons of&#13;
ammonium sulphate and 3.67 million tons of urea were imported in 1975-76.&#13;
Thus, imports of ammonium sulphate are fast dwindling while those of urea&#13;
have increased tremendously during the seventies. Imports of calcium&#13;
ammonium nitrate and complex fertilizers have also increased (luring this&#13;
period.&#13;
The contribution of imports to total fertilizer consumption&#13;
has fluctuated between 21% and 188% before 1960-61, and between 27% and 86%&#13;
thereafter (Table 4.31).   A ratio of current imports to current consumption&#13;
might be useful only if the fertilizer market was in equilibrium, i.e.,&#13;
demand was equal to supply for every year. Otherwise, this ratio is mis-&#13;
leading. If there is excess supply in a given year, the aggregate supply in&#13;
the following year will consist of three components: a) production, b)&#13;
excess supply from the previous year, and c) imports. Assuming that the&#13;
fertilizer market,was in equilibrium in 1951-52, i.e., the quantity consumed&#13;
was equal to the production plus imports, excess supply is calculated for&#13;
every year from 1952-53 onwards in Table 4.32. It is clear that total&#13;
supply exceeded total consumption, and therefore, availabilities of fer-&#13;
tilizer nutrients can not be considered as a factor constraining fertilizer&#13;
consumpion. The total supplies, compared with consumption, exceeded by 17%&#13;
(1954-55) and 242% (1961-62).&#13;
4.3.2      Import of Phosphatic Fertilizers:&#13;
Unlike the nitrogenous fertilizers, the imports constituted a&#13;
small fraction of total supply of the phosphatic fertilizers in India till&#13;
1965-66.  However, with the introduction of HYV's of wheat and rice in the&#13;
mid-sixties, the imports of P205 spurted to 148 thousand tons in 1966-67&#13;
(compared to 14.0 thousand tons in the previous year), and have fluctuated&#13;
between 361 thousand 1:ons and 32 thousand tons thereafter (Table 4.26).&#13;
The phosphatic fertilizers are mostly imported in the form of&#13;
complex fertilizers, and among NP and NPK complex fertilizers, diammonium&#13;
phosphate (18-46-0) occupies an important place. In 1975-76, India imported&#13;
536.0 thousand tons of DAP costing Rs. 1.48 billion. Ammonium nitrophosphate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
has also contributed significantly towards the imported phosphatic ferti-&#13;
lizers (Table 4.30). USA, UK, West Germany and France are the main expor-&#13;
ters of P 205 to India (Table 4.28).&#13;
The excess supply calculations for P20 (Table 4.33) reveal&#13;
some interesting results. Between 1952-53 and 1465-66, when imports were&#13;
meager, the excess supply fluctuated between 32% and 100% of the total&#13;
consumption. 1/   The increased imports of P 205 in 1966-67 and thereafter,&#13;
simply generated higher levels of surpluses - 90% in 1967-68 and 70% in&#13;
1968-69. The situation, however, changed drastically during the 1970-71 and&#13;
1973-74 periods. Instead of excess supply, the deficits of large quantities&#13;
occurred. These deficits ranged from 109.9 thousand tons in 1970-71 to&#13;
112.2 thousand tons in 1973-74. It's not clear how these deficits were met&#13;
during these years.2/&#13;
The phosphatic fertilizer imports are likely to increase in the&#13;
future for two reasons: First, efforts are being made to increase the&#13;
consumption of P 05 in order to attain better NPK balance; and second, the&#13;
creation of a buffer stock equivalent to 20% of the annual consumption.&#13;
4.3.3.     Import of Potassic Fertilizers:&#13;
As India does not have any known reserves of potash ores, the&#13;
potassic fertilizer reqirements are met through imports. Although India had&#13;
been importing K20 products since 1952-53, the quantity of K20 was insigni-&#13;
ficantly small compared to nitrogenous fertilizers till 1965-66 (Table&#13;
4.26). The introduction of high-yielding varieties in 1966-67 increased the&#13;
K 20 imports significantly.   Between 1966-67 and 1974-75, the K20 imports&#13;
increased by 270%, from 118 thousand tons in the former year to 437 thousand&#13;
tons in the latter.&#13;
The potassic fertilizers are mainly imported in the form of&#13;
muriate of potash (MOP) from Canada, East Germany, West Germany and USSR&#13;
(Table 4.29).   A small quantity of K20 is imported in the form of sulphate&#13;
of potash from West Germany.&#13;
1/   The manufacturers of P 20  have argued that the lack of demand is the&#13;
main reason for a very low capacity utilization. These calculations&#13;
might provide a partial support for their contention.&#13;
2/   These deficits are not identical to the economist's concept of "excess&#13;
demands" which are defined as the difference between expected demand&#13;
and expected supply at a given price. Thus, excess demand is an ex ante&#13;
while the deficits are ex post.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
4.3.4.     Self Sufficiency in Fertilizers&#13;
The Working Group on the Development of Fertilizer Industry has&#13;
estimated the future stream of production from the existing plants and plants&#13;
under erection (see tables 4.34A and B). The existing units are expected to&#13;
contribute 2.53 million tons of N while those under construction may produce&#13;
around 1.73 million tons of N in 1982-83. Thus, the total supply from&#13;
indigenous sources, after allowing for a 5% loss in production, would be&#13;
about 4.04 million tons. It is expected that the approved projects, viz,&#13;
Kakinada, Korba, Thal Vaishet, Assam, and Ahmedabad, might contribute around&#13;
540 thousand tons of N, thereby increasing the domestic supply of N to 4.58&#13;
million tons. As the projected demand for N by the Planning Commission&#13;
is 4.76 milion tons, 1/ India has to rely on imports. The creation of 20%&#13;
buffer stock will further widen the gap between demand and domestic supply.&#13;
In 1983-84, production from new units is expected tc increase to&#13;
1.125 million tons of N, which might enable India to achieve self-suffi-&#13;
ciency (Table 4.34C). The self-sufficiency, likely to be achieved in 1983-84,&#13;
could be sustained only if India plans to build at least 6 more plants, each&#13;
of 345 thousand tons of N capacity in a manner such that production from&#13;
these plants becomes available in 1984-85 and thereafter (see Table 4.34B).&#13;
Likewise in P 0 , India will achieve self-sufficiency in 1983-84&#13;
if the projects approve in principle are completed as scheduled (table 4.53B&#13;
and C). As the expected demand for P205 in 1987-88 is estimated around 2.5&#13;
million tons, while the production from the existing units and firm projects&#13;
will amount to 1.105 million tons, India has to rely on imports unless&#13;
additional capacity is built-up. To sustain the self-sufficiency achieved in&#13;
1983-84, India must build additional capacity of 1.90 million tons of P205&#13;
between 1983-84 and 1987-88 (table 4.35C).&#13;
However, various technical, financial, and sociopolitical factors&#13;
might delay the implementation of the approved projects, and therefore, India&#13;
would be dependent on imported fertilizers. Perhaps, the Planning Commission&#13;
has taken into account some of the possible constraints likely to influence&#13;
the implementation of the approved projects while formulating the Draft Five&#13;
Year Plan, 1978-83, and expects a shortfalls of 1.15 million tons of N and&#13;
475 thousand tons of P205 in 1982-83 (table 6). These shortfalls are sub-&#13;
stantially higher than those estimated by the Working Group (see tables 4.34C&#13;
and 4.35C). Thus, even by the end of the current Five Year Plan, imports&#13;
will account for nearly one-third of the total fertilizer consumption in&#13;
India.&#13;

4.4 Raw Materials&#13;
Availability of raw materials appears as an important constraint&#13;
on utilizing the existing capacity as well as on building additional capa-&#13;
city in the fertilizer industry. Although various raw materials are used in&#13;
the production of nitrogenous fertilizers, a little less than three-fourths&#13;
of the existing capacity is based on naphtha (Table 4.20). Natural gas is&#13;
used for 17% of the current capacity under production. The remainder of the&#13;
capacity, approximately 13%, uses electric power, coke, coke-oven-gases&#13;
(COG), lignite and imported ammonia.&#13;
Significant changes have taken place in the use of feedstocks&#13;
for N production during the last two decades. In 1955-56, coke and coke-&#13;
oven gases were the major raw materials used in the production of nitrogen&#13;
in India. After a decade,naphtha, electric power and lignite provided raw&#13;
materials for nearly one half of the capacity while the other half was still&#13;
dependent on coke and COG.- However, a major shift took place in early&#13;
seventies, and naphtha became one of the most important feedstock used in&#13;
nitrogen manufacture. Nearly three-fourths of the capacity under production&#13;
was based on naphtha in 1973.&#13;
As naphtha became relatively costlier due to increases in prices&#13;
of petroleum products, the Government of India in 1973-74 decided to cons-&#13;
truct the additional capacity based on fuel oil. Consequently, the use of&#13;
naphtha decreased from 75% in 1973 to 70 percent in 1976-77. Furthermore,&#13;
only about 17% of the additional capacity of 2.1 million tons presently&#13;
under construction wi]l be based on naphtha.   On the other hand, the use of&#13;
coal and fuel oil is likely to increase substantially. Nearly three-fourths&#13;
of the additional capacity under implementation as well as approved in&#13;
principle will use coal and fuel oil as raw materials. Thus, in the early&#13;
eighties, approximately 33% of the capacity will be based on naphtha and&#13;
another 33% will use coal and fuel oil as raw materials.&#13;
The availability of natural gas from Bombay High, Bassein and&#13;
Cambay basins will increase its use in place of fuel oil as a feedstock for&#13;
fertilizer production. In order to achieve self-reliance, natural gas and&#13;
coal would be encouraged in future nitrogen plants.&#13;
Table 4.21 provides information about the raw materials used&#13;
for phosphatic fertilizers. Sulphur and imported phosphoric acid are the&#13;
two most important feedstocks, accounting for nearly 80% of the P 0 capa-&#13;
city in India.  Nitric acid and smelter gases provide raw materias5 for&#13;
approximately 17 percent of the existing capacity under production.&#13;
4.4.1     Production and Potential of Raw Materials in India&#13;
Self-reliance in the production of fertilizers in India has&#13;
been stressed by the Government of India as well as by the industry.&#13;
In addition to capital requirements, the availability of raw materials at a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
relatively cheaper cost is important for attaining self-reliance in fer-&#13;
tilizer industry. Consequently, India has increased its production of raw&#13;
materials significantly during seventies and is actively engaged in explor-&#13;
ing the potential reserves of rockphosphate, oil and other petroleum&#13;
products.&#13;
Production of rock-phosphate has increased considerably during&#13;
the last ten years or so, although their present level of production is&#13;
much below the current requirements. In 1975-76, approximately 495 thousand&#13;
tons of rockphosphate was produced (Table 4.22). Udaipur district (Rajas-&#13;
than) alone supplied aproximately 94% of the total rockphosphate produced in&#13;
India in 1975-76 (Table 4.23).&#13;
The Geological Survey of India has estimated that Rajasthan&#13;
(Udaipur), Madhya Pradesh (Jhabua), Uttar Pradesh (Missouri), and West&#13;
Bengal (Purulia) have about 150 m tons of rockphosphate deposits. Of&#13;
these, nearly 100 m tons are expected to be located in Udaipur district.&#13;
However, only 11.9 million tons of these deposits contain greater than 30%&#13;
P205 while another 30 million tons has 20% P :0 5   Most of these deposits of&#13;
relatively high P 05 quality are concentrated in Jhamar Kotra and Maton&#13;
areas of Udaipur district. Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh also has 4.3&#13;
millions tons of rockphosphate reserves containing greater than 29% P 205&#13;
Other deposits are low in P 205 contents (Table 4.24).&#13;
Since rockphosphate is used in the production of SSP, TSP,&#13;
nitrophosphate and phosphoric acid, the location of new plants pro-&#13;
ducing phosphate fertilizers in the vicinity of Jhamar Kotra area may&#13;
save transportation costs.&#13;
India's production of sulphuric acid is mainly dependent on the&#13;
supply of iron pyrites (Amjore mines and Saladipura), copper pyrites (Ghat-&#13;
sila and Khetri), and waste gases from zinc pyrites (Udaipur). Since the&#13;
total supply of sulphuric acid from all these sources is very small, India&#13;
has to rely on imports of sulphur for the availability of sulphuric acid in&#13;
the future.&#13;
4.4.2     Oil and Natural Gas&#13;
A little less than two-thirds of the petroleum requirements&#13;
in India are met through imports. Increases in oil prices in 1973-74, and&#13;
thereafter, enhanced the cost of imported petroleum products from US$265&#13;
million in FY 1973 to US$1.6 billion in FY 1976. Consequently, the Govern-&#13;
ment of India increased its efforts to discover the potential sources of oil&#13;
in the country. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) carried success-&#13;
ful explorations in Bombay High and Bassein (North and South) structures and&#13;
discovered recoverable deposits of 200 million tons of oil and 30,000&#13;
million cubic meters of natural gas. 1/ In March 1977, Bombay High achieved&#13;
1/   See D.B. Mahatme, "India's Search for Oil" in Commerce, Annual Number&#13;
1976, pp. 161-164.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
an annual production oi- 2 million tons of oil. It is estimated that Bombay&#13;
High basin would attain a potential of annual production of 10 million tons&#13;
of oil by 1980-81. Around mid-eighties, Bassein (North) would have a&#13;
potential to add 3-4 million tons of oil per year.&#13;
At present, besides offshore oil production from Bombay High&#13;
and Bassein (North) structures, on-shore oil fields of Assam (Digboi,&#13;
Naharkotiya and Moran) and Gujarat (Ankleshwar, Kalol and Nawagaon) produce&#13;
approximately 8.3 million tons of crude oil per year. The recoverable&#13;
reserves from these two basins are estimated around 150 million tons of&#13;
oil.&#13;
The total reserves from these three basins, namely, Assam-&#13;
Arakan, Bombay High-Bassein, and Cambay (Gujarat), will be able to sustain&#13;
an annual production of approximately 20 million tons in the mid-eighties,&#13;
which will suffice for approximately two-thirds of the total petroleum&#13;
requirements in the country.&#13;
Thus, to become self-sufficient in the field of petroleum pro-&#13;
ducts, India has to continue its search for offshore and on-shore oil.&#13;
Preliminary investigations by the ONGC has identified 27 on-shore (17) and&#13;
off-shore (10) basins having a total.recoverable reserves of two billion&#13;
tons of oil and four billion tons oil-equivalent of natural gas.&#13;
Increased production of oil in India will not only help in&#13;
saving foreign exchange but also increase fertilizer production by meeting a&#13;
part of the industry's energy and raw material requirements.&#13;
India does not have any known deposits of potash ores, and there-&#13;
fore, the potassic fertilizer requirements have to be met by imports.&#13;
However, India can produce a small quantity of potassium chloride from&#13;
bittern, a waste product available from sea brine in the process of manu-&#13;
facturing the common salt. India's annual production of 6 million tons of&#13;
common salt makes available an equal quantity of bittern, which if evapo-&#13;
rated to 36 to 37.50 Be', will produce 45,000 tons of potassium chloride&#13;
and other marine chemicals. The Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research&#13;
Institute, Kandla, is engaged in developing processes to use bittern and&#13;
other waste products from sea brine. However, the supply of potassic&#13;
fertilizers through this process would remain very small.&#13;
5.0 Pricing of Fertilizer Products&#13;
In market economies, prices of different products are generally&#13;
determined by the interplay of demand and supply forces, although in certain&#13;
sectors, like energy and other public utilities, prices are governed by the&#13;
public regulatory agencies to protect the interests of the consumers along&#13;
with assuring a fair return on the investment by producers. In developing&#13;
economies, where structural transformations in consumption and production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
patterns are induced either by economic growth and development or by public&#13;
policy actions, the governmental regulations of prices and/or quantities of&#13;
scarce commodities are usually imperative.&#13;
The introduction of chemical fertilizers in developing countries in&#13;
general, and in India in particular, was not only an input for agricultural&#13;
production but also an innovation in the farm sector. Diffusion of any&#13;
innovation critically depends, among other things, on its profitability,&#13;
which, in turn, is determined by its price and productivity.&#13;
To promote an increasing use of fertilizers for agricultural&#13;
production and to enhance fertilizer production in the country, the Govern-&#13;
ment of India has assured smooth movements of fertilizer prices by statu-&#13;
torily controlling the prices of urea, ammonium sulphate, and calcium&#13;
ammonium nitrate and by providing the guidelines for the determination of&#13;
the prices of phosphatic and potassic fertilizers. Ocassionally, the&#13;
Government of India has protected the interests of the consumers and pro-&#13;
ducers by subsidizing the sale of fertilizers. Currently, the Government is&#13;
providing a subsidy of Rs. 1,250/- per ton of P205' The prices of NP and&#13;
NPK complex fertilizers were generally determined by the manufacturers till&#13;
March 1976. Now, a prior governmental approval of prices of these ferti-&#13;
lizers is mandatory.&#13;
Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1 indicate the current prices of different&#13;
fertilizers nutrients. Between March 1971 and May 1974, prices of various&#13;
fertilizer nutrients were generally stable. Prices of all fertilizer&#13;
nutrients recorded steep increases in June 1974, and were at their peak&#13;
between June 1974 and July 1975. As the increased prices of fertilizer&#13;
nutrients affected the fertilizer consumption adversely, the Government of&#13;
India started a series of price reductions in July 1975 and thereafter. In&#13;
March 1978, the nitrogen prices were Rs. 4.54, Rs. 3.37 and Rs. 4.08 per kg&#13;
through ammonium sulphate, urea and calcium ammonium nitrate respectively.&#13;
Thus, at these prices, urea appears to be the cheapest source of nitrogen.&#13;
The price of P205 is Rs. 3.27 per kg through single superphosphate while&#13;
that of K 20 is Rs. 1.34 per kg through muriate of potash.&#13;
Since the current pricing policy has been evolved through&#13;
different phases in the past, and differs from one product to another,&#13;
a brief historical analysis is pursued for different product categories.&#13;
5.1 Pricing of Nitrogeneous Fertilizers: 'Statutorily Controlled&#13;
To ensure an equitable' distribution of limited supply of ammonium&#13;
sulphate, which India received from the International Emergency Food Council&#13;
on a Government-to-Government basis, the Government of India established the&#13;
Central Fertilizer Pool in 1944 under the Ministry of Food and Agriculture.&#13;
The Pool operated on a no-profit no-loss basis and distributed fertilizers&#13;
to different Plantation Boards and State governments. Till December 1965,&#13;
the Pool acquired hundred percent of ammonium sulphate, urea, calcium&#13;

ammonium nitrate and other straight nitrogenous fertilizers produced in&#13;
the country at a retention price, which was determined by the Cost Account&#13;
Division of the Ministry of Finance by taking into account the cost of pro-&#13;
duction as well as a fair return on the investments made by the manufac-&#13;
turers. The Pool also imported nitrogeneous fertilizers to meet the con-&#13;
sumption needs in the country. The selling prices of these products were&#13;
fixed in such a way that profit or loss to the Pool was as low as possible.&#13;
Between 1944 and 1952, the ammonium sulphate price fluctuated&#13;
in the range of Rs. 241 and Rs. 380 1/ (Table 5.2). As a result of the&#13;
increased indigenous production from the FCI, Sindri and FACT, Alwaye&#13;
(Kerala) units in 1953, ammonium sulphate prices decreased to Rs. 290 - Rs.&#13;
310 for cultivators, and to Rs. 330-335 for industrial and plantation users.&#13;
Prior to 1953, the Pool charged an uniform price for AS to all users.&#13;
During 1953 and 1965, different prices were charged to State governments and&#13;
Plantation Boards (Table 5.3 and 5.4). The Tea, Coffee and Rubber Boards&#13;
paid generally a higher price compared to State Governments who were dis-&#13;
tributing fertilizers to cultivators. Perhaps, to stimulate the use of&#13;
nitrogenous fertilizers for agricultural production, the Pool charged&#13;
relatively lower prices for agricultural purposes. This price differential&#13;
was in the range of Rs. 5.0 and Rs. 42.0 for ammonium sulphate and between&#13;
Rs. 2 and Rs. 40 for urea. However, it is not clear why the farmers in&#13;
U.P., Madras and Orissa were charged different, and generally higher, prices&#13;
compared to their counterparts in other States and Union territories.&#13;
The Fertilizer Distribution Enquiry Committee in 1959-60 and&#13;
the Sivaraman Committee on Fertilizers in 1965 recommended that the manu-&#13;
facturers should have the "freedom of marketing" their own fertilizers.&#13;
Consequently, the Government of India gradually decreased the amount of&#13;
indigenous fertilizers acquired by the Central Fertilizer Pool and allowed&#13;
the manufacturers to fix their own prices for fertilizers except urea, AS&#13;
and CAN, whose prices were, and still are, statutorily fixed by the Pool&#13;
under the Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1957. In April 1969, the Pool did not&#13;
acquire any amount of fertilizers from domestic manufacturers (Table 5.8).&#13;
As a result of the Sivaraman Committee's recommendations, the Pool also&#13;
charged a uniform all India (FOR destination) price for urea, ammonium&#13;
sulphate and calcium ammonium nitrate.&#13;
The price build-up for each fertilizer takes into account the&#13;
landed cost of imported fertilizers, the cost of production of indigenous&#13;
fertilizers, handling charges at ports for imported fertilizers, interest on&#13;
investment for six months, incidental and overhead charges and the railway&#13;
freight. To this the margin for wholesalers and retailers is added. The&#13;
final price, called the Pool price, is the ceiling price for the farmer,&#13;
exclusive of central and state sales taxes and local duties but inclusive of&#13;
excise duty.&#13;

Between 1966 and 1969, the prices of urea, AS and CAN increased&#13;
respectively, only by 26%, 24% and 20% inspite of the 57% devaluation of&#13;
the Rupee in June 1966. In order to protect the interests of the farming&#13;
community, the Pool sold the fertilizers at the pre-devaluation prices by&#13;
incurring a loss of Rs. 44 millions. The Pool also protected the interests&#13;
of the manufacturers by providing a subsidy of Rs. 22.0 million to compen-&#13;
sate for the increased costs of the imported raw materials.&#13;
The price of urea, AS and CAN remained more or less unchanged&#13;
between April, 1969 and May 1974, except an increase in price during October&#13;
1973 to specifically cover the increased price of naphtha. The situation,&#13;
however, completely changed with the global energy and fertilizer crisis of&#13;
the early seventies. The prices of imported fertilizers and raw materials&#13;
increased substantially, leading to heavy losses for the Pool. The Government&#13;
of India resisted the increase in fertilizer prices to protect the interests&#13;
of the farming community for two years. However, as the burden was becoming&#13;
so heavy on the Exchequer, amounting nearly Rs. 400 crores annually, the&#13;
Government unwillingly increased the prices of urea, AS and CAN, respectively,&#13;
by 90%, 56% and 78% in June 1974. In absolute terms, prices of urea, AS and&#13;
CAN increased respectively, from Rs. 1,050, Rs. 600 and Rs. 615 per ton in&#13;
May 1974 to Rs. 2,000, Rs. 935 and Rs. 1,095 in June 1974. 1/ Even at these&#13;
new prices, the Pool was incurring losses on the imported fertilizers,&#13;
whereas the domestic manufacturers were having substantial margins over their&#13;
ex-factory realization prices or fair delivery prices. In order to partly&#13;
compensate for the losses on the imported fertilizers, the Fertilizer Pool&#13;
Equalization Charge was introduced in June 1974, under which the domestic&#13;
manufacturers agreed to pay the difference between the statutory price and&#13;
fair delivery price to the Central Fertilizer Pool. This charge was, Rs.&#13;
610, Rs. 195 and Rs. 295 per ton, respectively, on urea, AS and CAN in June&#13;
1974 (Table 5.9).&#13;
Although these price increases were financially justified in the&#13;
context of the prevailing international prices of chemical fertilizers,&#13;
the consumption of fertilizer nutrients was hit hard by them, and recorded&#13;
a historical decrease of 266 thousand tons in 1974-75 compared to 1973-74.&#13;
Even in 1975-76, the consumption of fertilizer nutrients remained close to&#13;
the 1973-74 level.&#13;
The decrease in fertilizer consumption could have been avoided,&#13;
if the industry and the Government had made efforts to increase capacity&#13;
utilization as the following calculations show:&#13;
If we subtract the Pool Equalization Charge from the statutory&#13;
prices of these products, we find that the domestic manufacturers were in a&#13;
position to supply urea, AS and CAN, respectively, at Rs. 1,390, Rs. 740 and&#13;
Rs. 800 per ton, implying an increases only of 32, 23 and 30 percent over&#13;
1/   See Tables 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
May 1974 prices0 These prices are much lower compared to what the farmers&#13;
were actually faced with in June 1974, and would not have affected the&#13;
fertilizer consumption adversely, if the domestic industry could produce&#13;
enough to meet the demand.&#13;
It is clear from Table 5010 that capacity utilization was very&#13;
low for these products in 1973-74 as well as in 1974-75. Urea plants were&#13;
utilizing only 53% of the installed capacity. Similarly, 48% of the CAN&#13;
capacity was lying idle in 1973-74. The situation was no better in 1974-75&#13;
than what it was in 1973-74. If these plants could use at least 80% to 90%&#13;
of their installed capacities, not only India could have saved scarce&#13;
foreign exchange used in importing urea, AS and CAN, but also it could have&#13;
provided fertilizers to its farmers at a relatively much cheaper rate.&#13;
Thus, the price differential between indigenously produced and imported&#13;
fertilizers provides a very strong incentive for India to increase the&#13;
capacity utilization and to expand the installed capacity for fertilizer&#13;
production.&#13;
Prompted by the price-responsiveness of the fertilizer demand, 1/&#13;
the Government of India reduced the prices of statutorily controlled&#13;
fertilizers in July 1975, March 1976, and February and November 1977 by&#13;
reducing the amount of the Fertilizer Pool Equalization Charge. 2/ These&#13;
downward movements of prices, inter alia, did stimulate fertilizer con-&#13;
sumption in 1975-76 and 1976-77, 3/&#13;
5.2 Pricing of NP and NPK Complex Fertilizers:&#13;
Unlike the manufacturers of urea, AS, and CAN, the producers of&#13;
NP and NPK complex fertilizers enjoyed the freedom of marketing and pricing&#13;
their products till March 1976. However, they had to consider the prices&#13;
fixed by the Central Fertilizer Pool for similar imported materials which&#13;
were freely available. The Pool prices were generally fixed by taking into&#13;
account the cost of imported fertilizers as well as the cost of indigenously&#13;
produced fertilizers.&#13;
Table 5.11 indicates the prices of different NP-and NPK complex&#13;
fertilizers, Generally, the prices have increased over time, although a&#13;
downward trend is perceptible after June 1974, when the prices of all&#13;
fertilizers climaxed. The retail prices of indigenously produced complex&#13;
fertilizers are generally higher compared to the prices of the imported&#13;
fertilizers before March 1976.&#13;
1/   Preliminary econometric estimates have revealed short-run and long-run&#13;
price elasticity for nitrogen as 0.40 and 1.85.&#13;
2/   See Table 5.9.&#13;
3/   For details, see section 3.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
In March 1976, the Government of India introduced a price sub-&#13;
sidy of Rs. 1,250 per ton of P 05 on indigenously produced phosphates to&#13;
stimulate their,consumption. Uonsequently, the manufacturers of complex&#13;
fertilizers cannot' increase the prices of complex fertilizers without prior&#13;
approval of the Government, so that the benefit of lower input costs can be&#13;
transferred to the farmers.&#13;
Table 5.12'indicates the nutrientwise prices of different fer-&#13;
tilizers through various fertilizer products. Among straight fertilizers,&#13;
urea and SSP provide the minimum cost of nitrogenous and phosphatic fer-&#13;
tilizers. Among complex fertilizers, the price of one kilogram of P 0&#13;
2 5&#13;
varies very widely among different products.    In April, 1976, the price of&#13;
one kilbgram .of P-0  was Rs 3.12 from DAP (18-46-0) and Rs. 7.77 from NPK&#13;
complex fertilizer 14--28-14), both,domestically produced. From imported&#13;
fertilizers, the price'varied between Rs. 3.32 from DAP (18-46-0) and Rs.&#13;
7.19-from.NPK complex (19-20-0).    An effort should be made to smoothen out&#13;
these differences, so that the'price per unit of nutrient (P 0 ) is more or&#13;
less equal'from different products.                            25&#13;
5.3  Pricing of Phosphatic Fertilizers&#13;
The 'Central Phosphate Pool,' established in 1948, imported as&#13;
well as acquired the domestically produced superphosphates, and distributed&#13;
them to the farmers at a reasonable price between 1948 and 1952. The price&#13;
paid to the manufacturers was based on a formula established by the Indian&#13;
Tariff Board reflecting. the changes in the prices of rock phosphate and&#13;
sulphur, the two major raw.materials for superphosphate.     Although the Pool&#13;
was disbanded in 1952, and the domestic manufacturers were free to market&#13;
their products, the Government continued to fix the superphosphate prices&#13;
using the formula suggested by the Tariff Commission in 1951. In May 1966,&#13;
the Government discontinued .and handed over this job to the Fertilizer&#13;
Association of India.   Since then, the Fertilizer Association of India has&#13;
been fixing the superphosphate prices by using the Tariff Commission's&#13;
formula:&#13;
Psp = 180 + 0.6 (Pr - 110) + 0.134 (Ps -180) + (Pj - 21),&#13;
where      Psp = price of one ton:of-superphosphate&#13;
Pr  = Ex-works price of one ton of rockphosphate&#13;
Ps = Ex-works price of one ton of sulphur&#13;
Pj. = Ex-works price of alkathene-lined jute bags for packing of&#13;
one ton of superphosphate.&#13;
The constant, 180, represents the base ex-works price of one ton of super-&#13;
phosphate for all manufacturing units situated within 100 miles of ports.&#13;
The,coefficients1in.the formula indicate the prevailing prices of raw&#13;
materials and the quantity of each that went into production of one ton of&#13;
superphosphate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
:56 -&#13;
In February 1974, the constant,- 180, in the above formula was&#13;
increased to 220 to compensate for the general increase in prices.&#13;
The superphosphate prices increased continuously but moderately&#13;
from Rs. 177.16 in March 1960, to Rs. 266.88 per ton in August, 1966.     These&#13;
increases were mostly due to increases in the rockphosphate and sulphur&#13;
prices (Table 5.13). After a modest fall in October 1966, the superphosphate&#13;
prices increased to Rs. 272.95 per ton in January 1967, and fluctuated&#13;
between Rs. 272.95 and Rs. 353.00 during 1967 and 1973 period.     In January&#13;
1974, the superphosphate price increased to Rs. 385 per.ton and continued to&#13;
move upward rapidly thereafter, till-October 1975. During January 1974 and&#13;
September 1975, the price of superphosphate increased, by 77%. Although a&#13;
moderate decrease took place in the price of superphosphate in October,1975,&#13;
yet it remained significantly higher than what it was in December 1973.&#13;
Since the higher prices of superphosphates were depressing the consumption of&#13;
phosphatic fertilizers, the Government.of India introduced a subsidy of Rs.&#13;
1,250 per ton of P205 in March 1976, ammounting to Rs. 200 per ton of. 16% WS&#13;
superphosphate. This subsidy helped reduce the prices of phosphatic ferti-&#13;
lizers in general and that of superphosphate in particular.&#13;
Since most of the triple superphosphate is imported, price of&#13;
TSP was relatively higher at Rs. 2,600 per ton in March 1978. The TSP price&#13;
has more than doubled between 1971 and 1974 and nearly tripled during 1968-74&#13;
(Table 5.13).&#13;
5.4 Pricing of Potassic Fertilizers:&#13;
Muriate of Potash (MOP) and Sulphate of Potash (SOP), the two&#13;
major sources of potassic fertilizers in India, are imported by the Minerals&#13;
and Metals Trading Corporation of India,. and are distributed by the Indian&#13;
Potash Limited, Madras. The retail prices of MOP and SOP are fixed by the&#13;
Government, although not statutorily.&#13;
Between 1960 and 1970, the price of MOP (60% K20) fluctuated&#13;
between Rs. 273 and Rs. 483, whereas that of 50% K20 MOP varied between&#13;
Rs. 220 and Rs. 463 per ton (Table 5.14). After 1971, India had been.&#13;
importing 61% K20 MOP whose retail price increased from Rs. 543 in March&#13;
1972 to Rs. 1,220 in June 1974-a 125 percent increase.. Against this, the MOP&#13;
prices increased only by 4% during 1969 to 1972 period. Similarly, the SOP&#13;
prices increased slowly before 1972 and nearly doubled between 1972 and&#13;
1974.&#13;
Like the higher prices of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers,&#13;
the increased prices of MOP and SOP reduced the consumption of potassic&#13;
fertilizers by 25% between 1973-74 and 1975-76. To prevent the further&#13;
decreases, and to stimulate the consumption of potassic fertilizers in order&#13;
to achieve a better balance between N, P, and K, the Government of India&#13;
decreased the MOP and SOP prices in July 1975, March 1976 and February 1977.&#13;
At present, the retail price of MOP is Rs. 805 per ton while that of SOP is&#13;
Rs. 140 per ton.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
5.5 Prices of Fertilizer Raw Materials:&#13;
Prices of raw materials, inter alia, play an important role&#13;
in determining the prices of final products. An increase in the price&#13;
of raw material, ceteris paribus, will lead to an increase in the product&#13;
price. Table 5.15 indicates the prices of naphtha, furnace oil, rock phos-&#13;
phate and sulphur (imported as well as indigenous) during 1970-76 period.&#13;
Before June, 1970, the price of naphtha was Rs. 104.70 per ton at Calcutta&#13;
port. Between June 1970 and June 1974, the price of naphtha nearly quad-&#13;
rupled - from Rs. 129.20 on June 1, 1970 to Rs. 501.36 on June 1, 1974. In&#13;
September 1975, the price of naphtha was further increased by Rs. 110.0 per&#13;
ton, thereby increasing the current price of naphtha to Rs. 611.36 per&#13;
ton.&#13;
A similar trend is noticeable in the price of furnace oil and&#13;
imported rock as well as sulphur. That is, the prices prevailing after June&#13;
1974 are two-to-three time higher compared to those prevailing before June&#13;
1974. Unlike the price of naphtha, prices of Jordan (70/72% BPL) rockphos-&#13;
phate and sulphur have decreased significatnly after April 1976, perhaps, due&#13;
to an increased supply of these two products in the world market. In April-&#13;
December 1977, the price of Jordan rockphosphate was Rs. 415 per ton. Prices&#13;
of Florida, Morocco and Senegal rockphosphate also decreased considerably&#13;
during 1975-76 and 1976-77 period.&#13;
Although the price of Udaipur rockphosphate also increased in&#13;
June 1974, the magnitude of increase was much smaller compared to imported&#13;
rocks. The price of Udaipur rockphosphate was Rs. 300 per ton in March&#13;
1978.&#13;
5.6 The Marathe Committee Report, 1976:&#13;
The pricing policy of the Government of India is based on the&#13;
recommendations of the Sivaraman Committee on Fertilizers, 1965. Since the&#13;
consumption, production and marketing of fertilizers have changed signifi-&#13;
cantly during the last 12 years, a need was felt by both the industry as well&#13;
as by the government to critically evaluate the existing methods of price&#13;
determination of fertilizer products. Hence a Committee headed by Mr. S. S.&#13;
Marathe, Secretary, Department of Industrial Development, was appointed in&#13;
January 1976 to evaluate the pricing methods for different fertilizer pro-&#13;
ducts. The Committee has submitted its interim report to Government on the&#13;
pricing policy for urea, ammonium sulphate and calcium ammonium nitrate in&#13;
July 1977.&#13;
The Government of India announced a new fertilizer price policy in&#13;
November 1977, under which a maximum retail price, a maximum ex-factory&#13;
delivery price (applicable to all units), and a fair ex-factory retention&#13;
price (for each unit producing urea, AS and CAN) were established. The&#13;
individual ex-factory retention prices were calculated by the Marathe Com-&#13;
mittee in such a way that a post-tax return of 12% on net worth was assured&#13;
(after deducting the expenses on raw materials, utilities, maintenance and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
other costs) on the assumption that the factory utilized 80% of its installed&#13;
capacity. The difference between the maximum ex-factory price and the&#13;
individual ex-factory retention price would be credited/debited to the&#13;
Fertilizer Price Fund Account administered by the Fertilizer Industry&#13;
Coordination Committee.&#13;
The maximum ex-factory price of Rs. 1,158 per ton of urea was&#13;
arrived at by the Marathe Committee by deducting the excise duty (Rs. 174),&#13;
the Fertilizer Pool Equation Charge (Rs. 65), the equated freight charge&#13;
(Rs. 38) and the dealers margin (Rs. 115) from the statutorily fixed maximum&#13;
retail price of Rs. 1,550 per ton of urea. This price will be effective&#13;
between November 1, 1977 and March 1, 1979 (see 5.16).&#13;
The ex-factory retention prices for various units producing urea,&#13;
AS and CAN are indicated in Table 5.17. Of 21 units producing urea, only&#13;
2 units, viz., IFFCO, and GSFC, have retention prices lower than the maximum&#13;
ex-factory.price of Rs. 1,158. All other units have significantly higher&#13;
retention prices, and therefore, the production of urea will remain highly&#13;
subsidized till March 1979.&#13;
The maximum ex-factory prices for ammonium sulphate and calcium&#13;
ammonium nitrate are fixed at Rs. 625 and Rs. 686 per ton repectively. The&#13;
retention prices for six steel plants, producing ammonium sulphate using&#13;
by-product coke-oven-gas as feedstock are identical to the maximum ex-&#13;
factory price of A.S. Hence these plants would not need any subsidy from the&#13;
Fertilizer Price Fund Account. The Sindri, Namrup, Ennore, Cochin (FACT)&#13;
and Baroda plants will be subsidized by a margin of Rs. 194. Similarly, the&#13;
production of CAN will also be subsidized.&#13;
6.0 Distribution of Fertilizer Products&#13;
In the late forties and early fifties, The Central Fertilizer Pool&#13;
distributed the fertilizer products to the State Governments and the Commodity&#13;
Boards. The State Governments generally used the services of the cooperatives&#13;
as well as the Department of Agriculture to distribute the fertilizers among&#13;
the cultivators. During the First Five Year Plan, the Planning Commission&#13;
recommended that the State Governments should utilize the services of coopera-&#13;
tives to distribute fertilizers.&#13;
The National Cooperative Development and Warehousing Board in 1957,&#13;
the Working Group of the National Development Council in 1958, and the Nala-&#13;
garh Committee in 1958, further stressed the near monopoly role for the co-&#13;
operatives in the field of fertilizer distribution. Although the Central Gov-&#13;
ernment always advised the State Governments to use the services of the co-&#13;
operatives, the success of the cooperative sector in distributing the ferti-&#13;
lizers varied from state to state. In Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya&#13;
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Mysore (Karnataka), Orissa, Punjab and Rajasthan, the&#13;
cooperatives enjoyed a monopoly position in fertilizer distribution. Uttar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Pradesh continued to maintain government agencies in addition to cooperatives.&#13;
In Asam, the fertilizer distribution was entrusted entirely to private traders&#13;
whereas in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, private trade and cooperatives&#13;
functioned side by side. In Himachal Pradesh, the State Government controlled&#13;
the distribution of fertilizers through its own distribution centers.&#13;
The Fertilizer Distribution Enquiry Committe, 1959-60 and the&#13;
Sivaraman Committee, 1965 studied the fertilizer distribution patterns pre-&#13;
vailing in the fifties and early sixties, and recommended that private trade&#13;
should be allowed to distribute fertilizers, and the indigenous manufacturers&#13;
should have the 'freedom of marketing' their own products. Gradually, the&#13;
Government allowed the private traders through the licensing system to dis-&#13;
tribute fertilizers. This policy toned down the monopoly of cooperatives.&#13;
In 1969, the Governmenl replaced the cumbersome licensing procedures by a&#13;
simple registration system. This change encouraged the private manufactures&#13;
to develop their own distribution channels, and resulted into increased num-&#13;
ber of retail networks. By 1971, the number of private retail selling points&#13;
increased to 51,000 as against 33,000 in 1968-69.&#13;
The pattern, which emerged after The New Fertilizer Policy in 1966,&#13;
was such that the imported fertilizers were distributed solely by the coopera-&#13;
tives while the indigenous manufacturers distributed their products through&#13;
cooperatives as well as private trade depending on their relative efficiency&#13;
and effectiveness in a given area. During 1966 to 1968 period when there&#13;
was a slump in demand, compared to available supply, the Government allowed&#13;
the private traders to distribute imported fertilizers. But, once the&#13;
shortages were experienced, the Government reserved the distribution of the&#13;
imported fertilizers for the cooperatives alone. With limitecl availability&#13;
of imported fertilizers, the Central Government and State Governments asked&#13;
the private manufacturers to increase the share of cooperatives in fertilizer&#13;
distribution. Furthermore, the State Governments also argued that adultera-&#13;
tion and other malpractices by unscrupulous elements can only be effectively&#13;
checked if the cooperatives distribute a larger share of indigenous ferti-&#13;
lizers as well. The indigenous manufacturers disagreed with the State Gov-&#13;
ernments. Also, there was a disagreement between the manufacturers and&#13;
cooperatives about the distribution margins recommended by the National Com-&#13;
mission on Agriculture. To resolve these differences, a Committee, headed&#13;
by Mr. M.A. Quraishi, Secretary, Department of Cooperation, was appointed&#13;
in 1972.  The Committee recommended:&#13;
(i) The share of cooperative and public agencies might not be less&#13;
than 50 percent and may range up to 75 percent; the exact&#13;
share around 50% must be negotiated between manufacturers&#13;
and state cooperatives;&#13;
(ii) The percentage share should not be fixed statutorily;&#13;
(iii) Where the percentage share of institutional agencies is&#13;
already above 50%, it would not be reduced;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
(iv) The existing agreements between the manufacturers and their&#13;
dealers, approved by the Government, would not get affected&#13;
by these recommendations.&#13;
The Quraishi Committee also recommended that the distribution mar-&#13;
gins should be increased from Rs. 80.0 to Rs. 95.0 per ton of urea (Table&#13;
6.1). The enhanced margin will, however, be applicable only if the selling&#13;
price of urea was increased by the Government. The National Commission on&#13;
Agriculture recommended a margin of Rs. 122.40.&#13;
The current distribution margins for urea, ammonium sulphate and&#13;
calcium ammonium nitrate are, respectively, Rs. 115.0, Rs. 75.0 and Rs. 70.0&#13;
(Table 6.2). The Government has not indicated the detailed break-up of these&#13;
margins.&#13;
Figure 6.1 indicates the present fertilizer distribution network.&#13;
The Central Fertilizer Pool distributes the imported nitrogenous and complex&#13;
fertilizers to Commodity Boards and State Governments. The State Governments&#13;
use the services of the apex cooperative marketing societies, agro-industries&#13;
corporations, agricultural supply organizations (of the State Department of&#13;
Agriculture), mixture manufacturers and private distributors to distribute&#13;
fertilizers among wholesalers. However, not all the states use all these&#13;
agencies. States in the north, central, and west zones rely heavily on the&#13;
cooperatives while those in the south and east use predominantly private&#13;
distributors to distribute fertilizers among wholesalers. The cooperative&#13;
and private wholesalers supply fertilizers to the cooperative and private&#13;
retailers, who in turn, sell them to the farmers. The domestic manufacturers&#13;
and the Indian Potash Ltd. also use the services of the cooperatives as well&#13;
as private wholesalers and retailers to distribute the fertilizers. In some&#13;
cases, the manufacturers have opened their own depots at the block/mandi&#13;
levels and sell the fertilizers directly to the farmers. Likewise, some of&#13;
the state governments, like Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, sell ferti-&#13;
lizers to the farmers through the Department of Agriculture depots along with&#13;
cooperatives and private traders.&#13;
6.1 Dealers&#13;
The cooperatives have historically occupied a dominant place in&#13;
fertilizer distribution in the past. Prior to October 1966, when the new&#13;
fertilizer policy was enunciated, the Central Fertilizer Pool distributed&#13;
all nitrogenous fertilizers through cooperatives. The private retailers&#13;
handled only superphosphate, mixtures and domestically produced complex&#13;
fertilizers. In 1966-67, there were 48,031 cooperative retail sale points&#13;
for the distribution of fertilizers. As the manufacturers developed their&#13;
own distribution channels under the "freedom of marketing" principle of the&#13;
New Fertilizer Policy of 1965, the number of cooperative retail sale points&#13;
decreased to 30,670 in 1970-71 as against 48,031 in 1966-67. On the other&#13;
hand, the number of private retail sale points increased from approximately&#13;
33,000 in 1968-69 to 51,000 in 1970-71 (Table '6.5).&#13;

The Fertilizer Association of India conducted an extensive survey&#13;
of the marketing and distribution facilities in the country. According to&#13;
survey estimates, there were 6,058 wholesale and 56,867 retail outlets in&#13;
1969-70. Of these, 56% outlets belonged to the cooperative sector, and 44&#13;
percent to the private sector (Table 6.3).&#13;
Of all the dealers, south zone accounted for approximately 29% and&#13;
east zone for 23%. North and west zone, each accounted for nearly 14% of the&#13;
total outlets, leaving about one-fifth of the outlets for the central zone.&#13;
Central, north and west: zones had predominantly cooperative outlets while the&#13;
private retail outlets dominated in the south as well as east zones. The&#13;
spread of private retaLl net-work in the south and east zones is, perhaps,&#13;
due to the existence of private manufacturers like EID-Parry, and early users&#13;
of plantation boards.&#13;
At the state level, Tamil Nadu had the maximum number of retail&#13;
outlets, followed by Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka and Maharashtra.&#13;
These five states accounted for approximately 44% of the total retail outlets&#13;
in the country.&#13;
The cooperative sector accounted for more than 80% of the retail&#13;
outlets in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Delhi,&#13;
Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Jammu and Kashmir (Table 6.4). On the other hand,&#13;
Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh had predominantly private&#13;
retailers. Punjab had the maximum number of cooperative retailers as against&#13;
West Bengal's highest private retailers.&#13;
6.2 Location and Market Coverage&#13;
The cooperative and private retailers as well as wholesalers have&#13;
shown marked differences, at the state level, in locating their sale depots.&#13;
In most states, the cooperative wholesalers were concentrated at the block&#13;
or village-mandi level while the retailers were located in the interior mar-&#13;
kets, mainly at the village level. However, in some states like Maharashtra,&#13;
Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, the cooperative wholesalers operated&#13;
from the district headquarters too.&#13;
The private wholesalers, like their cooperative counterparts, pre-&#13;
ferred blocks or village-mandis as their headquarters. In Karnataka, Tamil&#13;
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab, the private wholesalers were mostly concen-&#13;
trated at the district: level.&#13;
The private retailers, unlike their cooperative counterparts, were&#13;
mostly concentrated at the village/mandi, and in some cases, at the block&#13;
levels. Since many of- the villages are located quite far from the mandis/&#13;
blocks, in the isolated areas, the private retailers were less accessible&#13;
to an average farmer compared to the cooperative retailers. The preference&#13;
of the private retailers at the mandi/block level might have been dictated&#13;
by the Smithian and Schumpeterian considerations, viz., size of market.    Since&#13;
the mandis and block headquarters are generally market centers, where the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
farmers come to sell their agricultural produce, and to buy non-agricultural&#13;
products, a private retailer can expect to have a reasonably good demand for&#13;
his products, viz., fertilizers, assuring an adequate return on his invested&#13;
capital. However, there are Sayian considerations too. That is, supply&#13;
creates its own demand. If the retailers go to interior villages, and dif-&#13;
fuse the fertilizers among the farmers through adequate sale efforts, they&#13;
can create demand for their products, viz, fertilizers. Furthermore, nearly&#13;
three-fourths of the district in India consume very minimal amount of fer-&#13;
tilizers. Hence, the private, as well as cooperative retailers must diffuse&#13;
to interior rural areas in order to enhance fertilizer consumption in India.&#13;
The market coverage of these retail outlets appears very inadequate.&#13;
There were 576 thousand villages and 56,867 retail outlets in 1969-70, thereby&#13;
giving a ratio of approximately 10 villages per retail outlet. In practice,&#13;
each retail outlet was serving between 2 and 50 villages. Thus, many blocks,&#13;
and villages therein, did not have any facilities for supplying fertilizers&#13;
to the farmers.&#13;
In 1975-76, the number of sale points increased to 94,623. Assuming&#13;
that nearly 10 percent of these outlets were wholesalers, we are left with&#13;
nearly 85,000 retailers to serve the farming community, implying a ratio of&#13;
nearly 7.0 villages per retail outlet. Although the average number of vil-&#13;
lages served by a retailer has decreased nearly by one-third, yet this ratio&#13;
is very high to effectively cover the entire farming population in India.&#13;
Moreover, the distribution of these retail outlets is very uneven.&#13;
The Government has set a target of having a retail point within 5&#13;
miles radius of every village in the country. This will imply a mean density&#13;
of four villages for every retailer. Hence, the industry and the Government&#13;
should make every effort to promote fertilizer use by expanding the sale&#13;
points into the remote areas of the country. The cooperatives must also&#13;
diffuse to the isolated villages.&#13;
6.3 Fertilizer Promotion Programs.&#13;
In order to arrest the further decrease in fertilizer consumption&#13;
due to price increases of June 1974, the Government of India not only reduced&#13;
the fertilizer prices, but also selected 58 districts in Rabi 1976-77 to&#13;
promote the use of fertilizer consumption. Although these districts were&#13;
well-endowed with irrigation facilities, the level of fertilizer use was&#13;
rather low. Under the Intensive Fertilizer Promotion Campaign, 58 districts&#13;
scattered all over the country were selected, and the extension workers were&#13;
deputed to work with farmers to promote fertilizer use. As a result of con-&#13;
centrated efforts in guiding and training the farmers for fertilizer use,&#13;
the fertilizer consumption in these districts increased significantly. The&#13;
fertilizer consumption in IFPC districts, taken together, increased by 26.5%&#13;
in Kharif 1976 compared to Kharif 1975 as against 18% increase for all-India&#13;
(Table 6.7). Although entire additional 8.5% percentage points cannot&#13;
be attributed to promotion efforts, a significant proportion of this must&#13;
be due to these promotional efforts. The success achieved by the Indo-German&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
Fertilizer Educational Project 1/ in 11 districts of West Bengal further&#13;
indicates the importance of educational and training efforts in promoting and&#13;
accelerating the consumption of fertilizer nutrients.&#13;
The FCI, IFFCO and other manufacturers have also started their&#13;
own promotion programs by selecting a few districts and/or a few villages&#13;
in a districts, and training the farmers about the use, and benefits of&#13;
chemical fertilizers. Under its village adoption program, the IFFCO unit&#13;
adopted 178 villages in 1978. 2/ Under this program, the villagers are not&#13;
only given lessons about "balanced nutrients" and package of "improved&#13;
practices" but also arrangements are made for adequate and timely supply of&#13;
fertilizer, improved seeds, and credit. Also, the IFFCO representatives try&#13;
to coordinate the activities of different professionals engaged in rural&#13;
development programs. The use of fertilizer nutrients, improved seeds and&#13;
cooperative credit has increased significantly in the adopted villages. For&#13;
example, the fertilizer consumption in Jharbalapura village of Bundi district&#13;
(Rajasthan) was 2322 kgs on a cultivated land of 705 hectares, with 73% of&#13;
it being irrigated. In July 1973, the village was adopted as an "IFFCO&#13;
Village." As a result of the adoption of village and implementation of&#13;
balanced fertilization program, area under high-yielding varieties of paddy&#13;
and wheat increased, respectively, from 24 and 259 hectares in 1972-73 to 132&#13;
and 305 hectares in 1976-77, whereas fertilizer consumption increased from&#13;
3,322 kgs in 1972-73 tc 19,302 kgs in 1976-77. 3/ As other adopted villages&#13;
have experienced similar successes, the village adoption program should&#13;
be extended to other remaining villages in order to promote fertilizer use&#13;
and agricultural output.&#13;
6.4 Transportation of Fertilizers: The RITES Study: 4/&#13;
As the demand for fertilizer nutrients accelerates in the country-&#13;
side of India, the transportation of fertilizer products from the factories&#13;
and ports to the farmers in villages acquires significance. The distribution&#13;
of fertilizer nutrients involves three phases, viz., primary, secondary and&#13;
tertiary. In the primary phase, the fertilizer products are shipped from&#13;
factories to warehouses (mostly at the district headquarters), whereas the&#13;
secondary phase consists of moving the fertilizers from warehouses to dealers.&#13;
Approximately 80% of the primary, and 30% of the secondary movement of fer-&#13;
tilizer-products is handled by railways. The transportation of fertilizer&#13;
from the dealers to the farmers is called the tertiary movement, which is&#13;
mostly handled by roadways. The transportation cost constitut:es nearly&#13;
one-third of the total distribution costs (see Table 6.8).&#13;

Project, 1978.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Railways play an important role in the transportation of fertilizer&#13;
products in India. Approximately, 80% of the imported, and 75% to 80% of the&#13;
indigenously manufactured fertilizers are moved by the railways. In 1975-76,&#13;
railways moved 7.2 million tons of fertilizer products and are anticipated&#13;
to move 13 million tons in 1978-79 (see Table 6.9). Between 1973-74 and&#13;
1975-76, the rail coefficient of fertilizer traffic 1/ varied between 2.9 and&#13;
3.6. Assuming an average coefficient of 3.0, the expected rail traffic would&#13;
be around 23 million tons in 1983-84 and 33 million tons in 1988-89.&#13;
Along with increase in fertilizer traffic, average lead has&#13;
increased from 675 kilometers to 859 kilometers and the trans-shipment of&#13;
products increased from 1.02 million tons to 1.53 million tons during 1966-67&#13;
to 1975-76 period. 2/ Both of these factors contribute significantly towards&#13;
the cost of transportation. It has been estimated that each trans-shipment&#13;
costs 11.26 paise per ton while the average cost per ton kilometer is around&#13;
6.7 paise on broad guage and 9.45 paise on meter gauge. The RITES study&#13;
indicates that 'average lead' can be reduced to 507 kms., along with a&#13;
significant reduction in transshipments, by following their rationalized&#13;
distribution plan. Under this Plan, 139 nodal points are selected by con-&#13;
sidering the level of consumption and irrigation potential in the surrounding&#13;
villages, transportation accessibility (like on the rail-head), warehousing&#13;
facilities and administrative infrastructure at the nodal point, inter-nodal&#13;
distances, and location of mixing or granulation plants. Districts are&#13;
allocated to these nodal points and consumption forecasts for 1978-79 are&#13;
derived at each nodal point. 3/ Given the consumption forecasts, a linear&#13;
programming model is used to assign these 139 nodal points to different&#13;
fertilizer plants and/or ports in such a way that the total cost of meeting&#13;
the fertilizer demand at all nodal points is minimum. Table 6.9 indicates&#13;
the Rationalized Distribution Plan. The study suggests to use product-&#13;
exchange among producers so that criss-crossing of fertilizers can be&#13;
reduced. Also, roads, as against railways, should be used for a distance of&#13;
less than 100 kms. The study predicts a severe transportation problem in&#13;
Western India as the existing railway capacity is nearly saturated, while new&#13;
fertilizer plants are being built there to take advantage of natural gas&#13;
available from the Bombay High and Cambay basins.&#13;

2/   See RITES, op cit, pp. VIII/2,8.&#13;
3/   The RITES study used the FAI's quadratic projections for each state and&#13;
apportioned them among districts on the basis of a three-year average&#13;
of a district's share in State's total consumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
The implementation of the RITES plan requires the creation of a&#13;
Central Marketing Authority to supervise the activities of manufacturers in&#13;
in order to restrict them to their assigned nodal points. This acts against&#13;
the 'freedom of marketing' principle enunciated earlier. However, the results&#13;
of the study should be useful in promoting voluntary product-exchange among&#13;
the manufacturers as well as in building additional capacities for transport-&#13;
ing fertilizers.&#13;

* One of the factories uses imported monoammonium  phosphate occasionally. During the&#13;
Sixth Plan it will have its own phosphoric acid plant.&#13;
* It would use both pyrites and sulphur.&#13;
@ ,The phosphoric acidis planned to be marketed.&#13;
Note: 1. Rockphosphate is the basic raw materialiwhich is processed with H,SO,, HNO, and H,P04&#13;
to release P O, in the desired concentration. Factories based on imported HJPO, do not&#13;
require either rock or sulphur as such to manufacture phosphatic fertilisers.&#13;

            A survey of the fertilizer sector in India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper analyzes the trends and
            patterns in consumption, production, and distribution of
            fertilizer nutrients in India, and provides the background
            information for the mathematical programming model of the
            Indian Fertilizer Sector. The consumption and production of
            chemical fertilizers have increased at an annual compound
            rate of, respectively, 17.9% and 17.6% during the last 25
            years. Approximately one-third of the consumption
            requirements are met through imports. As the growing need
            for foodgrains in India will continue to accelerate the
            demand for chemical fertilizers, the future planning of the
            fertilizer sector should obviously concentrate on devising
            an optimum combination of domestic production and imports,
            so that future supplies of fertilizer nutrients could be
            made available to the farmers at a minimum cost. Various
            issues related to optimum size, location, product-mix, and
            distribution patterns leading to minimum farm-gate price of
            chemical fertilizers are being explored by the programming
            methods, and will be reported in another paper in this series.
