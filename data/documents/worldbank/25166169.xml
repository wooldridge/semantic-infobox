                     World Bank Statement to the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee&#13;
                     Hafez Ghanem, Regional Vice President, MENA Region&#13;
                                      September 30, 2015&#13;
                                     New York, New York&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·      (Honorable) Foreign Minister of Norway, Mr. BÃ¸rge Brende and UN Secretary General&#13;
       Mr, Ban Ki Moon â&#128;&#147; the chair and host of this meeting&#13;
ï&#130;·      (Honorable) Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Rami Hamdallah;&#13;
ï&#130;·      (Honorable) Deputy Foreign Minister of the Government of Israel, Ms. Tzipi Hotoveli&#13;
ï&#130;·      Ministers, Secretaries, Ambassadors, Special Representatives, and distinguished guests&#13;
&#13;
Rapid and sustained Palestinian economic growth will only be possible with a peace agreement.&#13;
As you all know, the reality is that the Palestinian economy is in its third year of falling per capita&#13;
GDP. A quarter of the Palestinian labor force is still unemployed, and the Palestinian Authority&#13;
still has a financing gap of 400 million dollars in spite of their valiant efforts to manage amidst&#13;
declining donor inflows and unpredictable transfers.&#13;
&#13;
However the lack of a political horizon should not make us sit back and wait. Indeed, there are&#13;
practical, substantial actions that the parties and the international community can take to improve&#13;
the economic situation even before final status negotiations. This would not only help Palestinian&#13;
economic development, but also, if done right, would help build trust that could encourage the&#13;
peace process.&#13;
&#13;
This is exactly what the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s forthcoming strategy for Middle East and North&#13;
Africa says: use economic development to further peace and combat extremism.&#13;
&#13;
Building on recent meetings between the ministers of finance, more exchange of information can&#13;
only be helpful -- not only on fiscal issues, but also related to water, telecommunications and&#13;
energy. A quick and complete resolution on the size and repayment terms of the debt owed to&#13;
Israel Electricity Company would be a good place to begin.&#13;
&#13;
Next, the Government of Israel could follow up on the very positive statements about the&#13;
importance of Palestinian standards of living, finalize and implement agreements related to water&#13;
and energy; and take steps to facilitate Palestinian access to natural resources in Area C.&#13;
&#13;
The Palestinian Authority has undertaken courageous and impactful reforms to contain the fiscal&#13;
deficit, lower health referral costs, improve the payments of electricity and control the wage bill.&#13;
More can be done to deepen the reforms â&#128;&#147; such as further efforts on domestic tax revenue&#13;
&amp;#12;generation, reform of the pension system, deepening the reform of intergovernmental fiscal&#13;
transfers as well as continued reform of the business climate.&#13;
&#13;
For donors, budget support remains essential for providing essential services until the reforms pay&#13;
off. Donors can also help the Palestinian Authority crowd in private investments in energy and&#13;
expand their support to water supply and sanitation as restrictions are lifted.&#13;
&#13;
In Gaza, the UNâ&#128;&#153;s mechanism has proven effective for repairs of housing and is currently&#13;
expanding to larger projects. But only 6% of the necessary materials have entered Gaza, and thus&#13;
the recovery from this war has been much slower than in the past. Alongside the Government of&#13;
Israelâ&#128;&#153;s allowing increased entry of reconstruction materials in to Gaza, donors need to deliver on&#13;
their pledges at Cairo because only a third of Cairo commitments have been disbursed.&#13;
&#13;
Taken concurrently, these actions â&#128;&#147; measures by Israel, Palestinian reforms, and donorsâ&#128;&#153; support&#13;
â&#128;&#147;will help private sector driven growth and generate revenues to strengthen and secure the&#13;
Palestinian economic foundation.&#13;
