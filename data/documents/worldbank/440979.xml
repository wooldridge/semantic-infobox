Rail and Subway Concessions in&#13;
Rio de Janeiro&#13;
Designing contracts and bidding processes&#13;
Jorge M. Rebelo    To help address a budgetary crisis in early 1995, the Rio de Janeiro state government began&#13;
reforms aimed at selling or concessioning to the private sector loss-making state-owned&#13;
enterprises. In the transport sector this meant selling or concessioning subway, commuter rail,&#13;
bus, and ferry services, at the time requiring subsidies of US$363 million annually. This Note&#13;
describes the concessioning of Rio's subway, the Metro, in December 1997 and its commuter rail&#13;
service, Flumitrens, in July 1998. Together they accounted for 80 percent of the subsidies. The&#13;
reform was expected to eliminate subsidies for the Metro and reduce them by two-thirds for&#13;
Flumitrens, to improve service, and to clear the backlog of maintenance and investment.&#13;
As a model and comparator for the Metro, the   concessionaire wins the concession. The sched-&#13;

            To help address a budgetary crisis in
            early 1995, the Rio de Janeiro state government began
            reforms aimed at selling or concessioning to the private
            sector loss-making state-owned enterprises. In the transport
            sector this meant selling or concessioning subway,
            commuterrail, bus, and ferry services, at the time requiring
            subsidies of US $363 million annually. This note describes
            the concessioning of Rio's subway, the Metro, in
            December 1997 and its commuter rail service, Flumitrens, in
            July 1998. Together they accounted for 80 percent of the
            subsidies. The reform was expected to eliminate subsidies
            for the Metro and reduce them by two-thirds for Flumitrens,
            to improve service, and to clear the backlog of maintenance
            and investment.
