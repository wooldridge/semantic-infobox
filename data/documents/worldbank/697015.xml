Principal and agent incentives are best clarified&#13;
through three mechanisms. First, property rights&#13;
should be defined, used, and accounted for un-&#13;

sector corporations. In practice, many SOEs have&#13;
been operated as if part of a government agency.&#13;

ernment office and as a result cannot be relied&#13;
op tes .     -  3U_    ;   on by creditors nor used to evaluate performance&#13;
against similar private firms.&#13;
Second, the corporation and its owners should&#13;
have separate legal identities to insulate man-&#13;

ment. Whilte SOBs can act as model employ-&#13;
ers, honor labor market legislation, and provide&#13;
comprehensive benefits to employees, the re-&#13;
ality of their employment strategies is not en-&#13;
couraging. Many SOEs are overstaffed, with&#13;
unacceptably low levels of productivity, absen-&#13;
teeism well above the private sector average,&#13;
and unbridled growth in nonmonetary benefits.&#13;
These conditions place too heavy a financial&#13;
burden on the enterprise and make targets set&#13;
by the government unattainable. The tempta-&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The legal structure of the modern
            corporate form has four fundamental elements--separate
            identity, limited liability for shareholders, centralized
            management, and transferability of shares. These, together
            with the dynamics of governance relationship between the
            owners, the supervisory board, and the executives of the
            firm, provide internal incentives for efficiency. However,
            the legal form alone is not sufficient to ensure efficiency.
            Certain external incentives must be in place for sustainable
            efficiency gains. Corporate performance is influenced by
            external pressures from competition in product, factor,
            debt, and equity markets and by regulation. The interplay of
            the internal and external incentives causes the managers to
            act in accordance with the goals of efficiency and
            profitability set by the owners. Also, it causes the modern
            corporation to act with a clarity and singleness of purpose.
            The absence of any of the internal or external incentives
            can seriously undermine performance.
