Introduction&#13;
The European Union contributed to the financing of the Local and Regional Competitiveness Project&#13;
through the Trust Fund to enhance the contribution of tourism to local economic development and&#13;
improve the capacity of the government and public entities to foster tourism growth and facilitate&#13;
destination management. The purpose of this note is to provide guidance on measures to ensure that the&#13;
contribution of the European Union in supporting the Project is widely recognized. This Visibility Note&#13;
will be revised and finalized by the World Bank Group and Delegation of the European Union as needed&#13;
within a month upon signing of the Administrative Agreement.&#13;
This Visibility Note will be revised and finalized by the World Bank Group and the Delegation of the&#13;
European Union as needed to take into account all the specific aspects of the Project within 2 months&#13;
upon signing of this Administrative Agreement.&#13;
The World Bank will launch the kick-off event and related visibility activities after May 2016.&#13;
Statement on Visibility&#13;
In identifying appropriate communication for the visibility of the Project's activities, the World Bank will&#13;
take into account the size and proportion of the EU's financing.&#13;
In all their common actions, the EU and the World Bank will use a common visual identity to put&#13;
emphasis on their partnership.&#13;
European Union Visibility: The World Bank intends to help promote the visibility and local awareness of&#13;
the EU Local and Regional Competitiveness Trust Fund in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
through the following types of activities:&#13;
a. Publications, training programs, seminars, and workshops financed by EU Local and Regional&#13;
Competitiveness Trust Fund grants should clearly indicate that the activities in question have&#13;
received funding from the European Union.&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿b. The logo (usually the European Union flag) should be used in publications financed by the EU&#13;
Local and Regional Competitiveness Trust Fund, and in banners and any other materials used in&#13;
seminars and training programs financed by the EU Local and Regional Competitiveness Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
c. Whenever possible and appropriate, joint press releases and joint media activities should be&#13;
undertaken to promote the partnership and to highlight common achievements. The World Bank&#13;
and the EU shall invite each other to participate at press conferences, donor conferences and&#13;
possible debates on the trust fund.&#13;
d. Where high level visits are planned concerning joint funded activities, the Parties will inform&#13;
each other and consider coordinating these activities and agreeing on joint messages.&#13;
e. All press releases issued by the Bank with respect to the EU Local and Regional Competitiveness&#13;
Trust Fund grants should refer to the financial contribution from the European Union.&#13;
f. Recipients should be encouraged to ensure that the EU Local and Regional Competitiveness Trust&#13;
Fund activities are covered by local print and electronic media, and that all related publicity&#13;
materials, official notices, reports, and publications explicitly acknowledge the European Union&#13;
as the source of funding received.&#13;
g. The display panels, with proposed logo of the Project, should be clearly visible so that those&#13;
passing are able to read and understand the nature of the action. The display panels should be&#13;
erected beside access routes to the site where the action is taking place and should remain in place&#13;
from the start of the action until six months after its completion.&#13;
h. Press conferences organized in the context of the communication and visibility plan for the EU&#13;
Local and Regional Competitiveness Trust Fund always be organized in cooperation with the&#13;
European Union. The EU flag should be displayed at all times.&#13;
i. Group visits by journalists to project sites may offer additional visibility opportunities and groups&#13;
of visiting journalists should be accompanied by representatives from the EU Delegation.&#13;
j. Publications, such as leaflets, brochures, and newsletters, will be prepared in order to&#13;
communicate the results of the actions under the project to specific audiences.&#13;
k. Photographs showing the progress of all actions, taken where appropriate to document the&#13;
progress of actions and events related to the EU Local and Regional Competitiveness Trust Fund&#13;
activities, be used in communication material.&#13;
1. In cases in which grant signing ceremonies take place, the Recipients be directed to include&#13;
officials from the European Union, and to invite local and international press to these ceremonies.&#13;
In addition, the World Bank will promote the visibility of the EU Local and Regional Competitiveness&#13;
Trust Fund by: (i) informing Country Managers/Directors of the importance of signing ceremonies and&#13;
the public to ensure recognition and support for EU funding; (ii) continuing widespread distribution and&#13;
inclusion of the EU Local and Regional Competitiveness Trust Fund in relevant Bank documents, and&#13;
(iii) information sessions for EU-related organizations.&#13;
The Program Logo&#13;
The proposed logo - EU logo, the World Bank IBRD logo and the name of the Project, as presented in&#13;
the header of the Visibility Note - will be used for all communication activities related to the financing.&#13;
The logo will be displayed on documentation related to activities, including publications, training&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿programs, seminars, and workshops financed by the EU Local and Regional Competitiveness Trust Fund,&#13;
clearly indicating that the activities in question have received funding from the European Union. In&#13;
addition, all press releases issued by the Bank with regard to the EU Local and Regional Competitiveness&#13;
Trust Fund grants shall refer to the financial contribution of the European Union.&#13;
Local Publicity Opportunities&#13;
In addition to the use of the logo, Bank field offices will take all appropriate measures to ensure that EU&#13;
Local and Regional Competitiveness Trust Fund activities are well-covered by local print press and&#13;
electronic media, and that all related publicity materials, official notes, reports, and publications explicitly&#13;
acknowledge the European Union as the source of funding received. Before initiating any information,&#13;
communication, or visibility activity, the Bank should contact the Press and Information Officer at the&#13;
accredited EU Delegation in the country, responsible for coordinating the overall EU communication&#13;
strategy in the country.&#13;
Ceremonial events&#13;
At grant signing ceremonies and other publicity events, the Bank's country-based staff will foster the&#13;
attendance and participation of country-based officials of the European Union in a manner that provides&#13;
due recognition of their donor status. Grant recipients should take the lead in organizing such ceremonies,&#13;
and recipients will be required to issue the formal invitation to attend. Such ceremonial events should also&#13;
be alerted to the media and publicity outlets referred to above.&#13;
Visibility from Headquarters&#13;
Locally-based staff will forward copies of all visibility materials, such as press releases, newspaper and&#13;
magazine articles, and photographs (including descriptive captions) to the following address:&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
Europe and Central Asia Region&#13;
1818 H Street, NW&#13;
Washington, DC 20433&#13;

All the visibility materials will also be forwarded to the EU Delegation in Skopje.&#13;
