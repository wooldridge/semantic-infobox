            This Note is a contribution to an
            ongoing debate about the subsidies and rebates provided by
            power utilities to encourage consumers to adopt efficient
            end-use appliances. The argument presented here does not
            deny the need for demand-side energy conservation strategies
            (commonly known as demand side management or DSM) DSM
            programs can and do have a useful role in raising energy
            efficiency. This Note examines one particular
            "brand" of DSM which some in the energy industry
            believe is seriously flawed.
