D.C. IFC coordinates its activities with the other institutions of the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank Group but is legally and financially independent. Its&#13;

The mission of IFC is to promote sustainable private sector&#13;
&#13;
investment in developing and transition countries, helping to&#13;

&#13;
the international financial markets, helps clients improve social&#13;
&#13;
and environmental sustainability, and provides technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
and advice to governments and businesses. From its founding in&#13;

1956 through FY05, IFC has committed more than $49 billion&#13;
&#13;
of its own funds and arranged $24 billion in syndications for&#13;

&#13;
        I. OVERVIEW&#13;
&#13;
        International Finance Corporation (IFC or the Corporation) is an international organization, established in 1956, to further economic&#13;
        growth in its developing member countries by promoting private sector development. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, which&#13;
        also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank), the International Development Association&#13;
        (IDA), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). It is a legal entity separate and distinct from the World Bank, IDA,&#13;
        and MIGA, with its own Articles of Agreement, share capital, financial structure, management, and staff. Membership in IFC is open&#13;
        only to member countries of the World Bank. As of June 30, 2005, IFCs entire share capital was held by 178 member countries.&#13;
&#13;
        IFCs principal products are loans and equity investments, with a small guarantee portfolio. Unlike most multilateral development&#13;
        institutions, IFC does not accept host government guarantees of its loans. IFC raises virtually all of the funds for its lending activities&#13;
        through the issuance of debt obligations in the international capital markets, while maintaining a small borrowing window with the&#13;
        World Bank. Equity investments are funded from net worth. During the year ended June 30, 2005 (FY05), IFC had an authorized&#13;
        borrowing ceiling of $3.0 billion (including $0.5 billion to allow for possible prefunding of the funding program for the year to June 30,&#13;
        2006 (FY06) during FY05).&#13;
&#13;
        IFCs capital base and its assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in US dollars. The Corporation seeks to minimize market risk&#13;
        (foreign exchange and interest rate risks) by closely matching the currency, rate bases, and maturity of its liabilities in various currencies&#13;
        with assets having the same characteristics. The Corporation controls residual market risk by utilizing currency and interest rate swaps&#13;
        and other derivative instruments.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
II. FINANCIAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
Basis of preparation of the Corporations financial statements&#13;
&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US&#13;
GAAP).&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has traditionally prepared one set of financial statements and footnotes, complying with both US GAAP and&#13;
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, principally due to material differences between US Statement of&#13;
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS&#13;
No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivatives and Certain Hedging Relationships (collectively SFAS No. 133), and its counterpart in&#13;
IFRS, IAS No. 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement, it has not been possible for the Corporation to satisfy the&#13;
requirements of both US GAAP and IFRS via one set of financial statements since the year ended June 30, 2000.&#13;
&#13;
IFC is actively monitoring developments related to accounting standards and the primary basis for preparation of its financial statements,&#13;
all with a view to the necessary systems and controls to manage its various lines of business. IFC plans to resume presentation of its&#13;
financial statements using IFRS by the year ending June 30, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
Unless stated otherwise, discussions of financial performance herein refer to income after expenditures for technical assistance and&#13;
advisory service (TAAS) (operating income). Operating income excludes the effects of SFAS No. 133. The effects of SFAS No. 133 on&#13;
net income are discussed in Section VII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial performance summary&#13;
&#13;
From year to year, IFCs operating income is affected by a number of factors, principally the magnitude of provisions for losses against&#13;
its loans and guarantees; impairment of equity investments; loans in nonaccrual status and recoveries of interest on loans formerly in&#13;
nonaccrual status; and income (dividends and capital gains) generated from its equity portfolio. A significant part of IFCs liquid assets&#13;
portfolio is invested in fixed income securities, which are also subject to external market factors that affect the value of such securities,&#13;
adding variability to operating income. Net income also includes net gains and losses on financial instruments other than from trading&#13;
activities, pursuant to the implementation of SFAS No. 133.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has been consistently profitable since its inception in 1956, and recorded operating income for FY05 of $1,953 million, as compared&#13;
with $982 million for the year ended June 30, 2004 (FY04), and $528 million for the year ended June 30, 2003 (FY03). The $1,953&#13;
million of operating income in FY05 was a record high for the third consecutive year for the Corporation, reflecting strong contributions&#13;
across each of IFCs main product lines: loans, equities and treasury operations. The Corporation reported record net income in FY05,&#13;
including the effects of SFAS No. 133, of $2,015 million, as compared with $993 million for FY04 and $487 million for FY03.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
III. CLIENT SERVICES&#13;
&#13;
Business overview&#13;
&#13;
In partnership with private investors, IFC assists in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector enterprises&#13;
by making investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC seeks to bring together&#13;
domestic and foreign private capital and experienced management and thereby create conditions conducive to the flow of private capital&#13;
(domestic and foreign) into productive investments in its developing member countries. In this way, IFC plays a catalytic role in&#13;
mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan syndications and&#13;
guarantees. In addition to project finance (described below) and resource mobilization, IFC offers financial and technical advisory&#13;
services to private businesses in developing member countries. It also advises member governments on private sector development&#13;
matters.&#13;
&#13;
IFCs investments are normally made in its developing member countries. The Articles of Agreement mandate that IFC shall invest in&#13;
productive private enterprise. The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify enterprises that are partly owned by the public&#13;
sector if such enterprises are organized under local commercial and corporate law, operate free of host government control in a market&#13;
context and according to profitability criteria, and/or are in the process of being totally or partially privatized.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporations main investment activity is project financing. This encompasses "greenfield" projects, expansions, and&#13;
modernizations. IFC also provides corporate credits to selected companies to finance ongoing programs of investment projects. In&#13;
addition, the Corporation facilitates financing through financial intermediaries, covering project and general purpose lending and&#13;
specialized lending products such as leasing, trade, and mortgage finance. These financial intermediaries function either as IFCs&#13;
borrower, on-lending to private sector companies at their own risk, or as IFCs agent, identifying companies for direct loans from IFC.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation applies stringent tests of enterprise soundness, project viability, and developmental impact in determining the eligibility&#13;
of projects for its investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Technical assistance and advisory services&#13;
IFC has historically delivered its mission primarily through investments. IFC has increased its efforts in frontier markets and sustainable&#13;
development. As a result, the demands on the Corporation for associated advisory work and technical assistance have increased and&#13;
continue to grow. In FY04, IFC established a funding mechanism for technical assistance and advisory services, funded by designations&#13;
of IFCs retained earnings. This funding mechanism finances project development facilities, private enterprise partnerships, and similar&#13;
facilities focused on small and medium-size enterprise development and similar initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
Amounts designated for technical assistance and advisory services are determined based on the Corporations annual operating income in&#13;
excess of $150 million, contemplating the financial capacity and priorities of the Corporation, and are approved by the Corporations&#13;
Board of Directors prior to the issuance of the annual financial statements. Expenditures for the various approved technical assistance&#13;
and advisory projects are recorded as expenses in the Corporations income statement in the year in which they occur, beginning in the&#13;
year ended June 30, 2005 (FY05), and have the effect of reducing retained earnings designated for this specific purpose. On August 3,&#13;
2004, IFCs Board of Directors approved a designation of $225 million of the Corporations retained earnings. On July 28, 2005, IFCs&#13;
Board of Directors approved a further designation of $125 million of the Corporations retained earnings. Additional information on the&#13;
funding mechanism for technical assistance and advisory services can be found in Notes A and K to the Corporations FY05 financial&#13;
statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Performance-based grants initiative&#13;
In FY05, IFC began the analysis to create a program to fund performance-based grants, targeted at specific industries in developing&#13;
countries. The performance-based grants initiative (PBGI) involves establishing a pool of resources for funding performance-based&#13;
grants to individual private-sector projects in developing markets. The PBGI will further IFCs frontier strategy by opening new&#13;
opportunities to generate developmental impact.&#13;
&#13;
The initiative has been discussed by IFCs Board of Directors during the second half of FY05 but no decisions on the principles or&#13;
modalities of the initiative have yet been made. As a result, IFC has designated $250 million of retained earnings for the initiative, with&#13;
further deliberations to occur in FY06 on the principles and specifics of the initiative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                              IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT 5&#13;

        Disbursements&#13;
        IFC disbursed $3.5 billion for its own account in FY05 ($3.2 billion in FY04). IFCs disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio for its own&#13;
        account, excluding fair value adjustments, (disbursed loan portfolio) grew 2% to $10.0 billion at June 30, 2005 ($9.7 billion at June 30,&#13;
        2004). IFCs equity investment portfolio, net of impairment write-downs and including unrealized gains on investments in LLPs and&#13;
        certain LLCs, grew 32% to $2.5 billion at June 30, 2005 ($1.9 billion at June 30, 2004). The increase in the equity investment portfolio&#13;
        was principally attributable to the Corporations changed process of estimating impairment as detailed in Note C to the Corporations&#13;
        FY05 financial statements.&#13;

        Disbursed B-loans&#13;
        The portfolio of disbursed and outstanding B-loans at June 30, 2005 totaled $4.4 billion in 204 transactions, compared with $5.1 billion&#13;
        in 204 transactions at June 30, 2004.&#13;
&#13;
        Additional information on IFCs loans and equity investments as of and for the years ended June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004 can be&#13;

        Loans&#13;
        Loans account for the major part of the financing provided by IFC, representing 81% of the Corporations disbursed investment portfolio&#13;
        as of June 30, 2005, compared with 79% at June 30, 2004.&#13;
&#13;
        Loans will generally have the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        Term: typically amortizing with final maturities of up to 12 years&#13;
                        Currency: primarily in major convertible currencies, principally US dollar, and to a lesser extent, Euro, Swiss franc and Japanese&#13;
                        yen&#13;
                        Interest rate: fixed or variable&#13;
                        Pricing: reflects such factors as market conditions and country and project risks; variable rate loans are generally tied to the&#13;
                        6-month LIBOR index in the relevant currency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Since the year ended June 30, 1999, IFC has offered local currency loan products to certain clients, provided that the Corporation is able&#13;
        to hedge its local currency exposure through mechanisms such as cross-currency swaps or forward contracts. Fixed-rate loans and loans&#13;
        in currencies other than US dollars are normally transformed, using currency and/or interest rate swaps, into US dollar variable rate&#13;
        loans.&#13;
&#13;
        On June 30, 2005, total loans disbursed and outstanding were $10.0 billion ($9.7 billion at June 30, 2004). At June 30, 2005, 81% (85%&#13;
        at June 30, 2004) of the Corporations loans were US dollar-denominated.&#13;

8 IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Equity&#13;
Equity investments accounted for 19% of the Corporations disbursed investment portfolio at June 30, 2005, compared with 21% at June&#13;
30, 2004. IFCs equity investments are typically in the form of common or preferred stock and are usually denominated in the currency&#13;
of the country in which the investment is made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Quasi-equity&#13;
In addition to traditional equity investments, the Corporation provides financing through a variety of quasi-equity instruments, which&#13;
constitute a growing portion of its investment portfolio. Quasi-equities include subordinated or convertible loans, asset-backed securities,&#13;
mortgage-backed securities, and certain common or preferred shares with put and/or call features. Depending upon their characteristics,&#13;
quasi-equities may be classified as either loans or equity investments in the Corporations balance sheet. At June 30, 2005, the&#13;
Corporations disbursed and outstanding quasi-equity portfolio totaled $1,768 million ($1,645 million at June 30, 2004), of which $1,638&#13;
million was classified as loans ($1,483 million at June 30, 2004) and $130 million was classified as equity investments ($162 million at&#13;
June 30, 2004) in the Corporations balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Loan participations (B-loans)&#13;
IFC finances only a portion, usually not more than 25%, of the cost of any project. All IFC-financed projects, therefore, require other&#13;
financial partners. The principal direct means by which the Corporation mobilizes such private sector finance is through the sale of&#13;
participations in its loans, known as the B-loan program. Through the B-loan program, IFC has worked primarily with commercial banks&#13;
but also with nonbank financial institutions in financing projects since the early 1960s. Over 150 commercial banks and nonbank&#13;
financial institutions currently participate in IFCs B-loan program.&#13;
&#13;
Whenever it syndicates a loan, IFC will always make a loan for its own account (an A-loan), thereby sharing the risk alongside its loan&#13;
participants. IFC acts as the lender of record and is responsible for the administration of the entire loan, including the B-loan. IFC&#13;
charges fees to the borrower at prevailing market rates to cover the cost of the syndication of the B-loan. Since it began its loan&#13;
syndication program, IFC has placed participations totaling $24 billion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management products&#13;
IFC provides clients with access to asset and liability management tools such as currency swaps and interest rate swaps, caps and floors&#13;
by acting as an intermediary between clients and market counterparties. IFC also provides risk-sharing structures and guarantees that&#13;
allow its clients to transact directly with market counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees and partial credit guarantees&#13;
The Corporation offers partial credit guarantees to clients covering, on a risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. The&#13;
Corporations guarantee is available for debt instruments and trade obligations of clients and covers commercial as well as&#13;
noncommercial risks. IFC will provide local currency guarantees, but when a guarantee is called, the client will generally be obligated to&#13;
reimburse the Corporation in US dollar terms. Guarantee fees are consistent with IFCs loan pricing policies. During FY05, the&#13;
Corporation signed $0.2 billion of guarantees, substantially unchanged from FY04.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Advisory activities&#13;
The Corporation, on its own or through a department jointly managed with the World Bank, provides three general types of advisory&#13;
services to member countries and individual enterprises:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Special advisory services on project structuring and financial packaging.&#13;
       Financial advisory services provided to member governments or to private sector clients.&#13;
       Policy advice to governments on capital markets development and private sector development, including privatization and&#13;
       foreign investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation also assists governments with developing legal frameworks for privatizing their state-owned sectors and selling&#13;
individual enterprises. Fees are charged for advisory services consistent with market rates charged for comparable services. IFC&#13;
recorded such fees amounting to $41 million for FY05 ($41 million for FY04 and $51 million for FY03).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                 IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT 9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Technical assistance and advisory services&#13;
        The provision of technical assistance and advisory services (TAAS) is an essential part of IFCs business. TAAS programs help IFC to&#13;
        deliver its mandate to support sustainable private sector development, helping to enrich development impact and distinguish IFC from its&#13;
        competition. Beginning in FY05, the Corporation established a funding mechanism for TAAS, funded by designations of IFCs retained&#13;
        earnings, in order to address its increased efforts in TAAS. IFC delivers TAAS through mechanisms such as Project Development&#13;
        Facilities and Private Enterprise Partnerships. In IFCs FY05 financial statements, expenditures for TAAS are separately reported as&#13;
        Expenditures for technical assistance and advisory services. Prior to FY05, such expenditures were reported as Contributions to special&#13;
        programs in noninterest expense. In FY05, expenditures for TAAS totaled $38 million. In FY04, Contributions to special programs was&#13;
        $29 million, compared with $28 million in FY03. In FY05, such vehicles included:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                The World Bank Groups Global SME Capacity Building Facility, which funds partnerships and programs that support the&#13;
                core pillars of the World Bank Groups Small and Medium-Size Enterprise (SME) strategy.&#13;
                The Private Enterprise Partnership, which provides focused technical assistance, with the goal of helping build successful&#13;
                private businesses in the former Soviet Union region.&#13;
                The Private Enterprise Partnership for Africa, which enhances support to SMEs through project development and engaging in&#13;
                improving the investment climate.&#13;
                The Private Enterprise Partnership for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) , which provides technical assistance to&#13;
                support private sector development to all countries in the MENA region.&#13;
                The Corporations own Technical Assistance Trust Fund, which provides resources through which IFC can cofinance&#13;
                technical assistance being supported by donors.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Borrowings&#13;
        The major source of IFCs borrowings is the international capital markets. Under the Articles of Agreement, the Corporation may borrow&#13;
        in the public markets of a member country only with approvals from that member and also the member in whose currency the borrowing&#13;
        is denominated. The Corporation borrowed $2.0 billion during FY05 ($3.0 billion in FY04 and $3.5 billion in FY03). In addition, IFCs&#13;
        Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase and redemption of and tender for debt obligations issued by the Corporation. During&#13;
        FY05, the Corporation repurchased and retired $133 million of outstanding debt ($33 million in FY04).&#13;
&#13;
        IFC diversifies its borrowings by currency, country, source, and maturity to provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Outstanding&#13;
        market borrowings have remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to almost 30 years, with a weighted average remaining&#13;
        maturity of 11.6 years at June 30, 2005 (11.9 years at June 30, 2004).&#13;
&#13;
        Market borrowings are generally swapped into floating-rate obligations denominated in US dollars. As of June 30, 2005 the Corporation&#13;
        had gross payables from borrowing-related currency swaps of $9.4 billion ($9.1 billion at June 30, 2004) and from borrowing-related&#13;
        interest rate swaps in the notional principal amount of $6.7 billion ($7.3 billion at June 30, 2004). After the effect of these derivative&#13;
        instruments is taken into consideration, all of the Corporations market borrowings at June 30, 2005, and June 30, 2004, were US dollar-&#13;
        denominated.&#13;
&#13;
        The weighted average cost of market borrowings after currency and interest rate swap transactions was 3.3% at June 30, 2005 (1.0% at&#13;
        June 30, 2004).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Capital and retained earnings&#13;
        As of June 30, 2005, IFCs net worth (presented as Total Capital in the Corporations balance sheet) amounted to $9.8 billion, up from&#13;
        the June 30, 2004 level of $7.8 billion.&#13;
&#13;
        As of June 30, 2005 and 2004, IFCs authorized capital was $2.45 billion, of which $2.36 billion was subscribed at June 30, 2005,&#13;
        unchanged from June 30, 2004. Over 99% of this was paid in ($2.36 billion at June 30, 2005, and June 30, 2004). The Corporation has&#13;
        agreed to defer the payment dates for certain member countries. Pursuant to these arrangements, $1 million of subscribed shares&#13;
        remained unpaid at June 30, 2005 ($1 million at June 30, 2004).&#13;

V.       ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
In executing its sustainable private sector development business, IFC assumes various kinds of risks. The Corporations management&#13;
has defined a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, within which it recognizes four main risk groupings: strategic risk,&#13;
credit risk, financial risk, and operational risk.&#13;
&#13;

             People, Systems, &amp; Processes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Active management of these risks is a key determinant of the Corporations success and its ability to maintain a stable capital and&#13;
earnings base, and is an essential part of its operations. As part of its enterprise risk management framework, the Corporation has&#13;
adopted several key financial and exposure policies and a number of prudential policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY05 enterprise risk highlights&#13;
The Corporation established a regionally organized Project Risk Management function as part of its Financial Operations Department&#13;
that will be responsible for centrally managing investment project administration and compliance monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
A Business Risk Department was established to focus on the aspects of strategic and other risks the Corporation faces that are not&#13;
explicitly monitored by established functions. It has also subsumed the operational risk framework development and Anti-Money&#13;
Laundering and Combating of Financing of Terrorism functions.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation has initiated policy reviews in two areas: first, of its financial policies, to confirm that these are in line with new&#13;
business imperatives and best practices in risk management; secondly, of its Safeguard Policies, Policy on Disclosure of Information, and&#13;
Environmental, Health &amp; Safety (EHS) Guidelines, involving a comprehensive update of its policies and guidelines, subsequent to&#13;
stakeholder consultation and expert guidance. The reviews, including Board approval of revised policies, are expected to be completed&#13;
during FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines strategic risk as the potential reputational, financial and other consequences of a failure to achieve its strategic mission and,&#13;
in particular, its sustainable development mandate.&#13;
&#13;
The overall management of strategic risk is effected through the definition and implementation of an annual strategy for meeting the&#13;
Corporations mission and guidelines for its investment operations and advisory services. The strategy is developed with Senior&#13;
Management by the Operational Strategy Group, and is approved by the Board of Directors. The Operations Evaluation Group conducts&#13;
ex post evaluations of the implementation of the Corporations investment strategy on an ongoing basis.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic risk includes the risk incurred by IFC in exercising its environmental and social development framework in member countries.&#13;
Responsibility for managing this part of strategic risk rests with the Environmental and Social Development Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                  IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT 13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        The key guiding principles and policies established as part of the framework for controlling strategic risk are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Guiding principles for IFCs operations&#13;
           Catalytic role: IFC will seek above all to be a catalyst in facilitating productive investments in the private sector of its developing&#13;
           member countries. It does so by mobilizing financing from both foreign and domestic investors from the private and public&#13;
           sectors.&#13;
&#13;
           Business partnership: IFC functions like a business in partnership with the private sector. Thus, IFC takes the same commercial&#13;
           risks as do private institutions, investing its funds under the discipline of the marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
           Additionality: IFC participates in an investment only when it can make a special contribution not offered or brought to the deal by&#13;
           other investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Environmental and social policies&#13;
           The Corporation has developed a comprehensive set of Guidelines and Safeguard Policies to promote environmentally and&#13;
           socially responsible private sector investments. Project sponsors are given the Safeguard Policies for environmental and social&#13;
           issues to review prior to conducting their assessments, as well as the environmental, health, and safety guidelines specific to the&#13;
           particular industry, sector, and type of project.&#13;
&#13;
           When making investments, IFC applies its standards to the project and project performance is monitored against those standards.&#13;
           Projects are expected to comply with the applicable policies and guidelines, as well as applicable local, national, and international&#13;
           laws.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        FY05 strategic risk highlights&#13;
        Two years ago, IFCs Environmental and Social Policies became widely recognized as best practice when twelve international&#13;
        commercial banks adopted them in the form of the Equator Principles. To date, a total of 31 leading international financial institutions&#13;
        have adopted these principles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Credit risk&#13;
&#13;
        IFC defines credit risk as the potential reduction in value of on- and off-balance sheet assets due to a deteriorating credit profile of its&#13;
        clients, the countries in which it invests, or a financial counterparty. Credit risk is incurred in two areas of the Corporations operations:&#13;
        (i) in its investment operations, where IFC provides loans, equity investments, guarantees and derivatives for clients in its developing&#13;
        member countries, and (ii) in its treasury operations, where credit risk is incurred with counterparties in IFCs liquid asset investment,&#13;
        borrowing and asset-liability management activities. As part of its mandate, IFC is prohibited from accepting host government&#13;
        guarantees of repayment on its investments and, therefore, incurs commercial and sovereign risk on its investments.&#13;
&#13;
        The Corporations Risk Management and Financial Policy Department has oversight responsibility for overall credit risk management&#13;
        and, in addition, monitors and controls credit risk arising in IFCs treasury activities. With respect to IFCs credit risk exposures to&#13;
        clients in developing countries, the Credit Review Department plays a key role. At origination of new investments, the Credit Review&#13;
        Department analyzes information obtained from the investment departments and provides an independent review of the credit risk of the&#13;
        transaction. After commitment, the quality of IFCs loan and equity investment portfolio is monitored according to supervision&#13;
        principles and procedures defined in the Operational Policies and Procedures. Responsibility for the day-to-day monitoring and&#13;
        management of credit risk in the portfolio rests with the portfolio management units of individual investment departments. Their&#13;
        assessments are subject to quarterly review, on a sample basis, by the Loss Provisioning Division of the Controllers and Budgeting&#13;
        Department and by the Credit Review Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14 IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Corporations investment portfolio is subject to a number of operational and prudential limits, including limitations on single&#13;
project/client exposure, single country exposure, and segment concentration. Similarly, credit policies and guidelines have been&#13;
formulated covering treasury operations; these are subject to annual revision by the Risk Management and Financial Policy Department,&#13;
and approval by the Finance and Risk Committee. Specifically, IFC has adopted the following key exposure policies:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Investment operations+&#13;
  1.    IFC does not normally finance for its own account more than 25% of a projects cost.&#13;
  2.    An equity investment in a company does not normally represent more than 35% of the companys total share capital,&#13;
        provided further that IFC is not the single largest shareholder. Until IFC resumes presentation of its financial statements in&#13;
        accordance with IFRS, IFCs equity investment in a company will not normally represent more than 20% of the companys&#13;
        total share capital.&#13;
  3.    Investment in a single obligor may not exceed 3% of IFCs total investment portfolio.&#13;
  4.    Equity plus quasi-equity investments in a single obligor may not exceed 3% of the Corporations net worth plus general&#13;
        reserves, and straight equity investments may not exceed 1.5%.&#13;
  Portfolio Management+&#13;
  1.    Total investments in a single country will not normally represent more than 12% of IFCs total investment portfolio or 25%&#13;
        of its net worth plus general reserves. Review trigger levels of between 1% and 6% of the portfolio are set for each country.&#13;
  2.    IFC lender of record disbursed exposure in a country may not exceed 10% for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and 5% for&#13;
        all other countries. Exceptions for countries with low levels of external debt may be set by the Finance and Risk Committee.&#13;
        Lower trigger levels are set for certain countries.&#13;
  3.    The Corporations total exposure to a single risk sector may not exceed 8% of the total investment portfolio. Lower review&#13;
        trigger levels are set for single sectors, and individually for the finance and insurance sector, based on IFCs total portfolio&#13;
        and the country exposure level.&#13;
  4.    IFCs held guarantees that are subrogated in local currency are limited to $200 million.&#13;
  + All exposures are net of specific reserves&#13;
  Treasury operations&#13;
  1.    Counterparties are subject to conservative eligibility criteria, currently restricted to banks and financial institutions with a&#13;
        minimum credit rating of A by leading international credit rating agencies.&#13;
  2.    Exposures to individual counterparties are subject to diversification caps. For derivatives, exposure is measured in terms of&#13;
        "worst case" potential exposure based on simulations of market variables. Institution-specific limits are updated monthly&#13;
        based on changes in counterparty size or credit status.&#13;
  3.    To limit exposure, IFC signs collateral agreements with counterparties that require the posting of collateral when net&#13;
        exposure exceeds certain predetermined thresholds, which decrease as a counterpartys credit rating deteriorates.&#13;
  4.    Because counterparties can be downgraded during the life of a transaction, the agreements provide an option for IFC to&#13;
        terminate all swaps if the counterparty is downgraded below investment grade or if other early termination events occur that&#13;
        are standard in the market.&#13;
  5.    Limits are also imposed on the volume of over-the-counter derivative transactions with individual counterparties.&#13;
  6.    For exchange-traded instruments, IFC limits credit risk by restricting transactions to a list of authorized exchanges, contracts&#13;
        and dealers, and by placing limits on the Corporations open interest rate position in each contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY05 credit risk highlights&#13;
IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60&#13;
days unless management anticipates that collection of interest is expected in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
The amount of nonaccruing loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, a key indicator of portfolio performance, decreased to&#13;
6.4% at June 30, 2005, compared with 11.5% at June 30, 2004. The principal amount outstanding on nonaccrual loans totaled $634&#13;
million at June 30, 2005, a decrease of 43% from the June 30, 2004 level of $1,121 million.&#13;
&#13;
The quality of IFCs investment portfolio, as measured by the aggregate risk level, improved further during FY05, continuing the trend&#13;
noted during the second half of FY03 and FY04. As a result, total reserves against losses on loans at June 30, 2005, decreased to $989&#13;
million ($1,367 million at June 30, 2004). This is equivalent to 9.9% of the disbursed loan portfolio, significantly below the level of&#13;
14.0% at June 30, 2004. As discussed in Note E to the Corporations FY05 financial statements, the Corporation changed its process of&#13;
estimating impairment on equity investments to adopt an impairment methodology based largely on fair value estimates. As a result, the&#13;
Corporation recorded a change in carrying value of the equity investment portfolio. In this regard, the Corporation determined that&#13;
impairments and changes in carrying value were deemed to be other than temporary. This change in carrying value of the equity&#13;
portfolio has been reflected in net income from equity investments in the income statement and in equity investments in the balance&#13;
sheet.&#13;

&#13;
        IFC operates under the assumption that the guarantee portfolio is exposed to the same idiosyncratic and systematic risks as IFCs loan&#13;
        portfolio and the inherent, probable losses in the guarantee portfolio need to be covered by an allowance for loss. The allowance at June&#13;
        30, 2005, was $13 million ($16 million at June 30, 2004), based on the year-end portfolio, and is included in payables and other liabilities&#13;
        on the balance sheet. The reduction in allowance for the year, $3 million for FY05 ($14 million for FY04), is included in the release of&#13;
        (provision for) losses on loans and guarantees in the income statement.&#13;
&#13;
        The Corporation has not suffered credit losses on its exposures to derivatives counterparties in its treasury operations.&#13;
&#13;
        Financial risk&#13;
&#13;
        IFC defines financial risk in three components: (a) the potential inability to realize asset values in its portfolio sufficient to meet&#13;
        obligations to disburse funds as they arise (liquidity risk); (b) the potential inability to access funding at reasonable cost (funding risk);&#13;
        and (c) a deterioration in values of financial instruments or positions due to changes in market interest and exchange rates and the&#13;
        volatility thereof (market risk).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Key financial policies&#13;
        IFC currently operates under a number of key financial policies as detailed below, which have been approved by its Board of Directors:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      1.   Disbursed equity plus quasi-equity investments (net of write-downs) may not exceed 100% of net worth and disbursed&#13;
                           equity (net of write-downs) may not exceed 50% of net worth.&#13;
&#13;
                      2.   Minimum liquidity (liquid assets plus undrawn borrowing commitments from the World Bank) must be sufficient at all&#13;
                           times to cover at least 65% of IFCs estimated net cash requirements for the next three years.&#13;
&#13;
                      3.   The currency, rate basis, and maturity of loan assets must be closely matched to borrowings; trigger levels at which foreign&#13;
                           exchange and interest rate exposures are hedged are defined.&#13;
&#13;
                      4.   Capital (paid-in capital plus retained earnings plus general loan loss reserves) must equal at least 30% of risk-weighted&#13;
                           assets.&#13;
&#13;
                      In addition, under IFCs Articles of Agreement, as long as IFC has outstanding borrowings from the World Bank, IFCs leverage,&#13;
                      as measured by the ratio of IFCs debt (borrowings plus outstanding guarantees) to IFCs equity (subscribed capital plus retained&#13;
                      earnings), may not exceed 4.0 to 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Liquidity risk&#13;
&#13;
        Within the key financial policies described above, in practice the Corporation maintains, as a prudential measure, an operating liquidity&#13;
        target of not less than 70% of three years net cash requirements, including projected disbursement and debt service requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16 IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The primary instruments for maintaining sufficient liquidity are the Corporations liquid asset portfolios. As noted above, IFC&#13;
distinguishes five such portfolios:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        P0, which is generally invested in short-dated deposits, money market funds, and tri-party repos, reflecting its use for short-&#13;
        term funding requirements;&#13;
        P1, which is generally invested in: (a) foreign sovereign, sovereign-guaranteed and supra-national fixed income instruments&#13;
        (rated AA- or better); (b) US Treasury or agency instruments; (c) asset-backed securities rated AAA by at least two rating&#13;
        agencies and/or other AAA rated notes issued by Corporations; (d) interest rate futures and swaps to manage currency risk in&#13;
        the portfolio, as well as its duration relative to benchmark; and (e) cash deposits;&#13;
        P2, which is generally invested in US Treasuries and other sovereign and agency issues;&#13;
        P3, which comprises a global fixed income portfolio and a mortgage-backed securities portfolio (managed by external&#13;
        managers); and&#13;
        P4, which is an outsourced portion of the P2 portfolio (managed by external managers).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY05 liquidity risk highlights&#13;
At June 30, 2005, the Corporations liquidity level stood at $13.3 billion, or 142% of its projected net cash requirements for three years&#13;
($13.1 billion, and 116% at June 30, 2004).&#13;
&#13;
Funding risk&#13;
&#13;
The Corporations primary objective with respect to managing funding risk is, through the adoption of the key financial policies&#13;
described above, to maintain its AAA credit rating and, thereby, maintain access to funding as needed at the lowest possible cost. Access&#13;
to funding is maximized, and cost is minimized, by issuing debt securities in various capital markets in a variety of currencies, sometimes&#13;
using complex structures. These structures include borrowings payable in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or&#13;
interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market index, a reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or&#13;
more foreign exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY05 funding risk highlights&#13;
During FY05, the Corporation raised $2.0 billion ($3.0 billion in FY04) of funding at sub-LIBOR rates.&#13;
&#13;
Market risk&#13;
&#13;
The Corporations exposure to market risk is minimized by adopting the matched funding policy noted above and by using a variety of&#13;
derivative instruments to convert assets and liabilities into 6-month floating rate US dollar assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investment operations&#13;
Implementation of the matched funding policy is a two-step process: funds are earmarked at Board approval stage and matched, with&#13;
respect to interest rate and currency, at disbursement. Interest rate and currency exchange risk associated with fixed rate and/or non-US&#13;
dollar lending is hedged via currency and interest rate swaps that convert cash flows into variable rate US dollar flows.&#13;
&#13;
Exposures to market risk resulting from derivative transactions with clients, which are intended to facilitate clients risk management, are&#13;
minimized by entering into offsetting positions with highly rated market counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolios&#13;
Consistent with the matched funding policy, the P0, P1 and P3 portfolios are strictly managed to variable rate US dollar benchmarks, on&#13;
a portfolio basis. To this end, a variety of derivative instruments are used, including short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange&#13;
forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. The Corporation&#13;
also takes both long and short positions in securities in the management of these portfolios to their respective benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
The primary source of market risk in the liquid asset portfolios is the P2 and P4 portfolios, which, in contrast, are managed to a three-&#13;
year duration US dollar benchmark, with additional flexibility to deviate from the benchmark. P2 represents the portion of IFCs capital&#13;
not disbursed as equity investments, and the benchmark reflects the chosen risk profile for this uninvested capital. P4 represents an&#13;
outsourced portion of the P2 portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities&#13;
Market risk associated with fixed rate obligations and structured instruments entered into as part of the Corporations funding program is&#13;
mitigated by using derivative instruments to convert them into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the matched-funding&#13;
policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                               IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT 17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Asset-liability management&#13;
        While IFCs matched-funding policy provides a significant level of protection against currency and interest rate risk, the Corporation can&#13;
        be exposed to residual market risk in its overall asset and liability management. This residual market risk is monitored by the Asset-&#13;
        Liability Management group within the Treasury Department.&#13;
&#13;
        Residual currency risk arises from events such as changes in the level of non-US dollar loan loss reserves. This risk is managed by&#13;
        monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and hedging the exposure when the net asset or liability position exceeds&#13;
        $5 million equivalent,through spot sales or purchases.&#13;
&#13;
        Residual interest rate risk may arise from two sources:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Assets that are fully match-funded at inception, which can become mismatched over time due to write-downs, prepayments,&#13;
                 or rescheduling; and&#13;
                 Differing interest rate reset dates on assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        This residual risk is managed by: first, synchronizing interest rate reset dates on assets and liabilities at a portfolio level; and second,&#13;
        measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates, with an&#13;
        action trigger of $50,000 on this measure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        FY05 market risk highlights&#13;
        Total liquid asset returns (comprising interest, realized and unrealized gains and losses, and translation adjustments) were $358 million&#13;
        ($177 million in FY04 and $475 million in FY03), of which $148 million was attributable to the P2 and, beginning in FY04, the P4&#13;
        portfolio ($21 million in FY04 and $264 million in FY03). Currency translation losses for FY05 were $7 million ($7 million gain in&#13;
        FY04 and $8 million gain in FY03).&#13;
&#13;
        Operational risk&#13;
&#13;
        IFC defines operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from events involving people, systems and processes. These include both&#13;
        internal and external events, whether caused by a lack of controls, documentation, or contingency planning, or by breakdowns in&#13;
        information systems, communications, physical safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, or in the execution&#13;
        of legal, fiduciary, and agency responsibilities. As such, operational risk covers the risks emanating from the manner in which an entity&#13;
        is operated as opposed to the way it is financed.&#13;
&#13;
        Consistent with the Basel II Capital Adequacy guidelines, IFC is developing a matrix framework to analyze operational risk by&#13;
        identifying, for each area (people, systems and processes), which risks IFC will: (i) manage internally, as part of its ongoing business;&#13;
        (ii) alleviate through contingency planning; or (iii) insure externally, whether by subcontracting, outsourcing or hedging, including&#13;
        insurance.&#13;
&#13;
        Responsibility for the development of the framework for managing and monitoring operational risk, and for contingency planning for&#13;
        recovery from emergencies, now rests with the Business Risk Department. In respect of insurable operational risk, IFCs Insurance&#13;
        Services Group performs insurance reviews to identify the risks and assess the adequacy of existing insurance policies and limits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18 IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IFC seeks to mitigate the risks it manages internally by maintaining a comprehensive system of internal controls that is designed not only&#13;
to identify the parameters of various risks but also to monitor and control those areas of particular concern. Key components of this&#13;
effort are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Key components of operational risk management&#13;
        The Corporation has adopted the COSO1control framework and a control self-assessment methodology to evaluate the&#13;
        effectiveness of its internal controls in people, systems and processes, and it has an ongoing program in place to cover all&#13;
        significant business operations. In addition, the COBIT2 methodology is used to supplement the COSO review of the&#13;
        information technology function. The program includes compliance testing of key internal controls assuring the reliability of&#13;
        external financial reporting and has been applied to Donor Funded Operations as well.&#13;
        The Internal Audit Department of the World Bank Group performs ongoing independent review of the effectiveness of IFCs&#13;
        internal controls in selected key areas and functions.&#13;
        To promote data integrity, the Corporation has formulated a Data Management Policy. The policy is enforced by the&#13;
        Information Quality Group within the Controllers Department and through a network of Departmental Data Stewards.&#13;
        The Corporation has a New Products/Initiatives Assessment Group, with representation from key business and support&#13;
        functions, to ensure that processes and controls are in place to manage the risks in new products and initiatives before they are&#13;
        executed.&#13;
&#13;
   1. COSO refers to the Internal Control - Integrated Framework formulated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway&#13;
   Commission, which was convened by the US Congress in response to the well-publicized irregularities that occurred in the financial sector in the&#13;
   United States during the late 1980s.&#13;
   2 . COBIT refers to Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, first released in 1996, updated to the 3rd edition released in July&#13;
   2000, sponsored by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY05 operational risk highlights&#13;
IFC continues to focus on its preparedness to react to an emergency situation that disrupts its normal operations. During FY05, the&#13;
Corporation has:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Extended the scope of the back-up facilities available for its key systems and the testing thereof;&#13;
        Maintained computing facilities with wide-band communications linkages at the homes of staff considered essential to&#13;
        maintaining key business activities in the event that the headquarters building becomes unavailable for use in an emergency&#13;
        situation; and&#13;
        Undertaken periodic emergency response simulation exercises, to test the adequacy of its contingency planning and enhance the&#13;
        preparedness of its emergency management team.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation is continuing a multiyear effort to analyze and develop enhanced methodologies for measuring, monitoring and&#13;
managing operational risk in its key activities. During FY05, IFC has:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Continued a process-mapping exercise to identify potential areas of exposure to operational risk in investment processes and&#13;
        provide a basis for quantifying potential risks, with particular emphasis on its regional operations; and&#13;
        Started the development of a framework for IFCs strategic and operational risk functions within the newly established Business&#13;
        Risk Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Management has carried out an evaluation of internal controls over external financial reporting for the purposes of determining if there&#13;
were any changes made in internal controls during the year ended June 30, 2005, that had materially affected, or would be reasonably&#13;
likely to materially affect, IFCs internal control over external financial reporting. As of June 30, 2005, no such significant changes&#13;
occurred.&#13;
&#13;
Internal controls and procedures are those processes which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is&#13;
accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure by IFC.&#13;
Management believes that these controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2005.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
        VI. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
        The Notes to the Corporations FY05 financial statements contain a summary of the Corporations significant accounting policies,&#13;
        including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Certain of these policies are considered to be "critical" to the&#13;
        portrayal of the Corporations financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments,&#13;
        some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies include: (i) determining the level of the allowance for&#13;
        losses in the loan portfolio; (ii) determining the level of impairment of equity investments; and (iii) determining the valuation of certain&#13;
        financial instruments with no quoted market prices. Additional information about these policies can be found in Notes A, C, O and P to&#13;
        the FY05 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Reserve against losses on loans&#13;
&#13;
        The Corporation considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be&#13;
        unable to collect all amounts due according to the loans contractual terms. The reserve against losses for impaired loans reflects&#13;
        managements judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. The reserve&#13;
        against losses for loans includes an estimate of probable losses on loans inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable. The&#13;
        reserve is established through periodic charges to income in the form of a provision for losses on loans. Loans written off, as well as any&#13;
        subsequent recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
&#13;
        The assessment of the adequacy of total reserves against losses for loans is highly dependent on managements judgment about factors&#13;
        such as geographical concentration, industry, regional and macroeconomic conditions, and historical trends. Due to the inherent&#13;
        limitation of any particular estimation technique, management utilizes three different and independent methods to provide estimates for&#13;
        the total loan loss reserve balance: (1) a simulation model, (2) country risk ratings and probability of crisis associated with those risks,&#13;
        and (3) a model of the Corporations long-term historical loan portfolio experience. Changes in these estimates could have a direct&#13;
        impact on the provision and could result in a change in the reserve balance.&#13;
&#13;
        The reserve against losses on loans is separately reported in the balance sheet as a reduction of the Corporations total loans. Increases or&#13;
        decreases in the reserve level are reported in the income statement as provision for losses or release of provision for losses on loans, and&#13;
        guarantees. The reserve against losses on loans relates only to the Client Services segment of the Corporation (see Note R to the FY05&#13;
        financial statements for further discussion of the Corporations business segments).&#13;
&#13;
        Equity impairment&#13;
&#13;
        The Corporation assesses all equity investments for impairment each quarter. When an impairment is identified and is deemed to be other&#13;
        than temporary, the equity investment is written down to its impaired value, which becomes the new cost basis in the equity investment.&#13;
        The Corporation has elected to assume that all impairments shall be deemed to be other than temporary. Impairment losses are not&#13;
        reversed for subsequent recoveries in value of the equity investment until it is sold.&#13;
&#13;
        Prior to March 31, 2005, the Corporation had carried reserves against losses on the equity investment portfolio. During the year ended&#13;
        June 30, 2005, the Corporation changed its process of estimating impairment on equity investments to adopt an impairment methodology&#13;
        based largely on fair value estimates. As a result, the Corporation recorded a change in carrying value of the equity investment portfolio. .&#13;
        In this regard, the Corporation determined that all impairments and changes in carrying value were deemed to be other than temporary.&#13;
        This change in carrying value of the equity portfolio has been reflected in net income from equity investments in the income statement&#13;
        and in equity investments in the balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Valuation of financial instruments with no quoted market prices&#13;
&#13;
        As part of its compliance with SFAS No. 133, the Corporation reports at fair value all of its derivative instruments and certain&#13;
        borrowings that the Corporation has designated as components of fair value hedges. In addition, certain features in various loan&#13;
        agreements, equity investment agreements, and borrowing contracts contain embedded derivatives that, for accounting purposes, are&#13;
        separately accounted as either derivative assets or liabilities, including puts, caps, floors, and forwards. Few of these instruments have a&#13;
        ready market valuation. Therefore, the fair values of the financial instruments with no quoted market prices are estimated using&#13;
        sophisticated pricing models of the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Management makes numerous assumptions in&#13;
        developing the pricing models, including the appropriate discount rates, interest rates, and related volatility and expected movement in&#13;
        foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in assumptions could have a significant impact on the amounts reported as assets and&#13;
        liabilities and the related gains and losses reported in the income statement. The fair value computations affect both the Client Services&#13;
        and Treasury segments of the Corporation (see Note R to the FY05 financial statements for further discussion of the Corporations&#13;
        business segments).&#13;
&#13;
        Additional information can be found in Notes A, O and P to the FY05 financial statements.&#13;

&#13;
Overview&#13;
&#13;
The main elements of IFCs net income, and influences on the level and variability of operating and net income from year to year, are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ELEMENTS                                                         SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCES&#13;
 Operating income:&#13;
&#13;
 Spread on interest earning assets                                Nonaccruals and recoveries of interest on loans formerly in nonaccrual status and&#13;
                                                                  income from participation notes&#13;
&#13;
 Liquid asset income                                              Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the liquid asset portfolios&#13;
&#13;
 Income from the equity investment portfolio                      Performance of the equity portfolio (principally dividends, capital gains)&#13;
&#13;
 Provisions for losses on loans and guarantees                    Level of provisions for losses on loans and guarantees&#13;
&#13;
 Equity impairment write-downs                                    Amount of impairment write-downs&#13;
&#13;
 Noninterest income and expense                                   Level of technical assistance and advisory services provided by the Corporation to its&#13;
                                                                  clients, the level of expense from the staff retirement and other benefits plans, and the&#13;
                                                                  approved administrative and other budgets&#13;
&#13;
 Net income:&#13;
&#13;
 Net gains (losses) on other financial instruments                Principally, differences between changes in fair values of derivative instruments and&#13;
                                                                  changes in fair value of hedged items in fair value hedging relationships&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following paragraphs detail significant variances between FY05 and FY04, and FY04 and FY03, covering the periods included in&#13;
the Corporations FY05 financial statements. As disclosed in Note A to the Corporations FY05 financial statements, certain amounts in&#13;
FY04 and FY03 have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on operating&#13;
income, net income or total assets.&#13;
&#13;
FY05 versus FY04&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Operating income&#13;
The Corporations income before expenditures for TAAS and net gains (losses) on other financial instruments for FY05 was $1,991&#13;
million. Expenditures for TAAS for FY05 were $38 million, resulting in income after expenditures for TAAS (operating income) for&#13;
FY05 of $1,953 million, a third consecutive record year. The improvement was mainly attributable to significant equity income&#13;
(principally capital gains) and a continued overall improvement in the quality of the loan and equity investment portfolio, as measured by&#13;
portfolio impairment and portfolio risk levels. The aggregate risk level within the portfolio has reduced principally due to: (i) the&#13;
successful restructuring or rescheduling of problem projects; (ii) the growth in the outstanding portfolio in disbursements with better risk&#13;
ratings; (iii) the write-off of investments with worse risk ratings than the average risk rating of the portfolio; and (iv) an overall&#13;
improvement in country risk ratings. This improvement began during the latter stages of FY03 and continued through FY04 and FY05.&#13;
The Corporations liquid asset portfolios yielded strong positive contributions to the Corporations operating income.&#13;
&#13;
A more detailed analysis of the components of IFCs operating income follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
IFCs primary interest earning assets are its loan portfolio and its liquid assets portfolios. Net interest income, after charges on&#13;
borrowings are taken into account, increased by $229 million from $655 million in FY04 to $884 million in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
Interest and financial fees from loans (including guarantee fees) for FY05 totaled $660 million, compared with $518 million in FY04,&#13;
an increase of $142 million, or 27%. Interest income increased from $449 million in FY04 to $574 million in FY05. The growth in the&#13;
loan portfolio and the overall increase in average interest rates during FY05, when compared with FY04, contributed $118 million, net of&#13;
interest expense on lending-related swaps, of the increase in interest income. Recoveries of interest on loans being removed from non-&#13;
accrual status, net of reversals of income on loans being placed in nonaccrual status, were $8 million lower in FY05, compared to FY04,&#13;
at $31 million in FY05 ($39 million ­ FY04). Income from the Corporations participation notes, over and above minimum contractual&#13;
interest, totaled $55 million in FY05 ($40 million ­ FY04). Commitment and financial fees also grew to $86 million in FY05 from $69&#13;
million in FY04, reflecting strong commitments and disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
Interest income from time deposits and securities are discussed below, as a component of liquid asset income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                                                IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT 21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        The Corporations charges on borrowings increased by $168 million, from $141 million in FY04 to $309 million in FY05, largely&#13;
        reflecting the increased US dollar interest rate environment, when comparing FY05 and FY04. As the Corporations borrowings&#13;
        generally reprice every six months, the effect of the significant rise in the interest rate environment in the fourth quarter of FY04&#13;
        adversely impacted FY05 charges on borrowings. The weighted average cost of the Corporations borrowings outstanding from market&#13;
        sources, after the effects of borrowing-related derivatives, rose during the year from 1.0% at June 30, 2004 to 3.3% at June 30, 2005. The&#13;
        borrowings portfolio, net of borrowing-related derivatives and before the effects of SFAS No. 133, decreased by $0.4 billion in FY05&#13;
        from $16.4 billion at June 30, 2004, to $16.0 billion at June 30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Liquid asset income&#13;
        Liquid asset income comprises interest from time deposits and securities, net gains and losses on trading activities, and a small currency&#13;
        translation effect. The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, increased from $13.1 billion at June 30,&#13;
        2004, to $13.3 billion at June 30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
        Liquid asset returns totaled $358 million in FY05, reported as interest income from time deposits and securities ($533 million), and&#13;
        net losses on trading activities ($175 million) in the Corporations FY05 income statement. Liquid asset returns totaled $177 million in&#13;
        FY04, reported as interest income from time deposits and securities ($278 million), net losses on trading activities ($104 million), and&#13;
        currency translation gains ($3 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Net income from equity investments&#13;
        Net income from the equity investment portfolio increased by $707 million from $658 million in FY04 to $1,365 million in FY05.&#13;
&#13;
        The Corporation generated realized capital gains on equity sales for FY05 of $723 million, as compared with $381 million for FY04, an&#13;
        increase of $342 million. Realized capital gains on equity sales from 19 investments comprised 71% of the FY05 gains, compared to&#13;
        seven investments comprising 64% of the FY04 gains. IFC continued to take advantage of buoyant markets to sell equities and take&#13;
        some limited gains in investments where IFCs developmental role was complete, and where pre-determined sales trigger levels had been&#13;
        met.&#13;
&#13;
        Dividend income was also significantly higher in FY05 at $258 million, as compared with $207 million in FY04. Consistent with FY04,&#13;
        a significant amount of IFCs dividend income in FY05 was due to returns on the Corporations joint ventures in the oil, gas and mining&#13;
        sectors, which totaled $106 million in FY05, as compared with $65 million in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
        Beginning in FY05, the Corporations investments in its LLPs and certain LLCs are accounted for under the equity method. As a result,&#13;
        IFCs FY05 operating income includes unrealized income from its investments in LLPs and certain LLCs in the amount of $191 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Release of provisions for losses on loans and guarantees&#13;
        As noted above, the quality of the Corporations investment portfolio improved during FY05, continuing the trend noted in FY03 and&#13;
        FY04. As a result, IFC recorded a release of provisions for losses on loans and guarantees of $261 million in FY05, including a release&#13;
        of $3 million in respect of guarantees, a significant improvement over FY04 when the Corporation recorded a release of $103 million&#13;
        ($14 million in respect of guarantees). On June 30, 2005, the Corporations total reserves against losses on loans were 9.9% of the&#13;
        disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio (14.0% at June 30, 2004).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Noninterest income&#13;
        Noninterest income of $86 million for FY05 was $11 million higher than in FY04 ($75 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Noninterest expense&#13;
        Administrative expenses (the principal component of noninterest expense) increased by 12% from $360 million in FY04 to $403 million&#13;
        in FY05 principally reflecting the Corporations higher budget authority in FY05 when compared to FY04. Administrative expenses&#13;
        include the grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to the Corporations reimbursable program and jeopardy&#13;
        projects ($33 million in FY05, as compared with $34 million in FY04). The Corporation recorded expense from pension and other&#13;
        postretirement benefit plans in FY05 of $14 million, as compared with $19 million in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Net income&#13;
        As more fully disclosed in Notes A, O and P to the Corporations FY05 financial statements, the Corporation has designated certain&#13;
        hedging relationships in its borrowing activities and its lending activities as fair value hedges. The Corporation generally matches the&#13;
        terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial instruments hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates,&#13;
        reset dates, interest rates, and other features. However, differing valuation methodologies are applied to the derivative and the hedged&#13;
        financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in net&#13;
        gains (losses) on other financial instruments, in net income.&#13;
&#13;

The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income in FY05 and FY04 can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      FY05                FY04&#13;
  Operating income                                                                                     1,953              982&#13;

  Net gains (losses) on other financial instruments                                                       62                11&#13;
  Net income                                                                                           2,015              993&#13;
&#13;
Net gains (losses) on other financial instruments largely comprises the difference between the change in fair value of derivative&#13;
instruments and the change in fair value of the hedged item under designated hedging relationships.&#13;
&#13;
FY04 versus FY03&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Operating income&#13;
The Corporations operating income for FY04 was $982 million, a second consecutive record year, following FY03s then record&#13;
operating income of $528 million. The improvement was mainly attributable to significant equity income and an overall improvement in&#13;
the quality of the loan and equity investment portfolio, as measured by portfolio impairment and portfolio risk levels, principally due to a&#13;
reduction in the aggregate risk level within the portfolio resulting from the factors outlined above. This improvement began during the&#13;
latter stages of FY03 and continued through FY04 and resulted in a release of provisions for losses on loans, equity investments and&#13;
guarantees.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporations liquid asset portfolios yielded a positive contribution to the Corporations operating income although at a lower level&#13;
than in FY03 mainly due to the overall higher interest rate environment during FY04, with a significant rising interest rate environment&#13;
during the fourth quarter of FY04. The Corporation has a significant holding of fixed income securities, principally in its P2 portfolio,&#13;
that decline in value in a rising interest rate environment.&#13;
&#13;
A more detailed analysis of the components of IFCs operating income follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Net interest income&#13;
IFCs primary interest earning assets are its loan portfolio and its liquid assets portfolios. After charges on borrowings are taken into&#13;
account, net interest income increased by $86 million or 15% from $569 million in FY03 to $655 million in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
Interest and financial fees from loans (including guarantee fees) for FY04 were $518 million, compared with $477 million in FY03, an&#13;
increase of $41 million, or 9%. Interest income increased from $414 million in FY03 to $444 million in FY04, principally reflecting the&#13;
overall increase in average interest rates during FY04, when compared with FY03. The growth in the loan portfolio and the overall&#13;
increase in average interest rates during FY04, when compared with FY03, contributed $12 million, net of interest expense on lending-&#13;
related swaps, of the increase in interest income. Recoveries of interest on loans being removed from non-accrual status, net of reversals&#13;
of income on loans being placed in nonaccrual status, were $39 million in FY04 ($23 million ­ FY03). Income from the Corporations&#13;
participation notes, over and above minimum contractual interest, totaled $40 million in FY04 ($33 million ­ FY03). Commitment and&#13;
financial fees also grew from $63 million in FY03 to $69 million in FY04, reflecting strong commitments and disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
Interest income from time deposits and securities are discussed below, as a component of liquid asset income.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporations charges on borrowings decreased by $85 million, from $226 million in FY03 to $141 million in FY04, largely&#13;
reflecting the declining US dollar interest rate environment in late FY03 and early FY04. As the Corporations borrowings generally&#13;
reprice every six months, the effect of the significant rise in the interest rate environment in the fourth quarter of FY04 did not have a&#13;
significant impact on charges on borrowings until early FY05. The weighted average cost of the Corporations borrowings outstanding&#13;
from market sources, after the effects of borrowing-related derivatives, rose slightly during the year from 0.9% at June 30, 2003 to 1.0%&#13;
at June 30, 2004. The borrowings portfolio, net of borrowing-related derivatives and before the effects of SFAS No. 133, increased by&#13;
$0.5 billion in FY04 from $15.9 billion at June 30, 2003, to $16.4 billion at June 30, 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset income&#13;
Liquid asset income comprises interest from time deposits and securities, net gains and losses on trading activities, and a small currency&#13;
translation effect. The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities, increased marginally from $13.0 billion&#13;
at June 30, 2003, to $13.1 billion at June 30, 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                 IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT 23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        The overall rising interest rate environment experienced during FY04, concentrated in the fourth quarter, resulted in a negative impact on&#13;
        the carrying value of the Corporations fixed income liquid asset investments and, accordingly, lower total returns. Liquid asset returns&#13;
        totaled $177 million in FY04, reported as interest income from time deposits and securities ($278 million), net losses on trading&#13;
        activities ($104 million) and currency translation gains ($3 million) in the Corporations FY04 income statement. Liquid asset returns&#13;
        totaled $475 million in FY03, reported as interest income from time deposits and securities ($318 million), and net gains on trading&#13;
        activities ($157 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Net income from equity investments&#13;
        Net income from the equity investment portfolio increased by $513 million from $145 million in FY03 to $658 million in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
        The Corporation generated realized capital gains on equity sales for FY04 of $381 million, as compared with $52 million for FY03, an&#13;
        increase of $329 million. Realized capital gains on equity sales in FY04 were highly concentrated, with $193 million of the total capital&#13;
        gains resulting from sales or partial sales of single equity investments in each of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Korea, and Mexico.&#13;
        IFC took advantage of buoyant markets to take some limited gains in investments where IFCs developmental role was complete, where&#13;
        pre-determined sales trigger levels had been met, and where markets had valued them adequately. Such opportunities did not occur in&#13;
        FY03 with only one sale of an equity investment generating a capital gain in excess of $5 million.&#13;
&#13;
        Dividend income was also significantly higher in FY04 at $207 million, as compared with $147 million in FY03. Consistent with FY03,&#13;
        a significant amount of IFCs dividend income in FY04 was due in part to returns on the Corporations joint ventures in the oil, gas and&#13;
        mining sectors, which totaled $65 million in FY04, as compared with $61 million in FY03.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Release of provisions for losses on loans and guarantees&#13;
        As noted above, the quality of the Corporations investment portfolio improved during FY04, continuing the trend noted in the last nine&#13;
        months of FY03. As a result, IFC recorded a release of provisions for losses on loans and guarantees of $103 million in FY04, including&#13;
        a release of $14 million in respect of guarantees, a significant improvement over FY03 when the Corporation recorded a charge of $48&#13;
        million (which included a charge of $1 million in respect of guarantees). On June 30, 2004, the Corporations total reserves against&#13;
        losses on loans were 14.0% of the disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio (19.0% at June 30, 2003).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Noninterest income&#13;
        Noninterest income of $75 million for FY04 was $10 million lower than in FY03 ($85 million), principally due to lower service fees -&#13;
        $41 million in FY04, as compared with $51 million in FY03. FY03 service fees included the recovery of $11 million of overdue interest&#13;
        and penalties received from one of the Corporations client risk management derivatives to a client in the power sector which did not&#13;
        recur in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Noninterest expense&#13;
        Administrative expenses (the principal component of noninterest expense) increased by 8% from $332 million in FY03 to $360 million&#13;
        in FY04 principally reflecting the Corporations higher budget authority in FY04 when compared to FY03. Administrative expenses&#13;
        include the grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to the Corporations reimbursable program and jeopardy&#13;
        projects ($34 million in FY04, as compared with $30 million in FY03). The Corporation recorded expense from pension and other&#13;
        postretirement benefit plans in FY04 of $19 million, as compared with $24 million in FY03.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Net income&#13;
        As more fully disclosed in Notes A, N and O to the Corporations FY04 financial statements, the Corporation has designated certain&#13;
        hedging relationships in its borrowing activities and its lending activities as fair value hedges. The Corporation generally matches the&#13;
        terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial instruments hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates,&#13;
        reset dates, interest rates, and other features. However, differing valuation methodologies are applied to the derivative and the hedged&#13;
        financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in net&#13;
        gains (losses) on other financial instruments, in net income.&#13;
&#13;
        The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income FY04 and FY03 can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            FY04                FY03&#13;
          Operating income                                                                                    982               528&#13;

          Net income                                                                                          993               487&#13;

VIII. GOVERNANCE&#13;
&#13;
Management Changes&#13;
&#13;
The Board of Directors (the Board) is charged, under the Articles of Agreement, with the selection of IFCs President. Following the&#13;
decision by Mr. James D. Wolfensohn to retire on May 31, 2005, the Directors unanimously selected on March 31, 2005, Mr. Paul&#13;
Wolfowitz to be the next president. Mr. Wolfowitzs appointment became effective June 1, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Following the retirement of the Corporations Executive Vice President (EVP), Mr. Peter Woicke, effective January 31, 2005, Mr.&#13;
Assaad Jabre has been appointed Acting EVP, effective January 31, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Board of Directors&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with its Articles of Agreement, members of IFCs Board are appointed or elected by their member governments. These&#13;
Directors are neither officers nor staff of IFC. The President is the only management member of the Board, serving as a non-voting&#13;
member and as Chairman of the Board. The Board has established several Committees including:&#13;
&#13;
           Committee on Development Effectiveness&#13;
           Audit Committee&#13;
           Budget Committee&#13;
           Personnel Committee&#13;
           Ethics Committee&#13;
           Committee on Governance and Administrative Matters&#13;
&#13;
The Board and its Committees function in continuous session at the principal offices of the World Bank Group, as business requires.&#13;
Each Committees terms of reference establish its respective roles and responsibilities. As Committees do not vote on issues, their role is&#13;
primarily to serve the full Board in discharging its responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Committee&#13;
&#13;
Membership&#13;
The Audit Committee consists of eight members of the Board. Membership on the Committee is determined by the Board, based upon&#13;
nominations by the Chairman of the Board, following informal consultation with the Directors. In addition, membership of the&#13;
Committee is expected to reflect the economic and geographic diversity of IFCs member countries. Other relevant selection criteria&#13;
include seniority, continuity and relevant experience. Some or all of the responsibilities of individual committee members are performed&#13;
by their alternates or advisors. Generally, Committee members are appointed for a two year term; reappointment to a second term, when&#13;
possible, is desirable for continuity. Audit Committee meetings are generally open to any members of the Board who may wish to attend,&#13;
and non-Committee members of the Board may participate in the discussion. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee may&#13;
speak in that capacity at meetings of the Board with respect to discussions held in the Audit Committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key responsibilities&#13;
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to assist it in the oversight and assessment of IFCs finances and accounting, including&#13;
the effectiveness of financial policies, the integrity of financial statements, the system of internal controls regarding finance, accounting&#13;
and ethics (including fraud and corruption), and financial and operational risks. The Audit Committee also has the responsibility for&#13;
reviewing the performance and recommending to the Board the appointment of the external auditor, as well as monitoring the&#13;
independence of the external auditor and meeting with it in executive session. The Audit Committee participates in oversight of the&#13;
internal audit function, including reviewing the responsibilities, staffing and the effectiveness of internal audit. The Committee also&#13;
reviews the annual internal audit plan and meets with the Auditor General in executive session. In the execution of its role, the&#13;
Committee discusses with management, the external auditors, and the internal auditors, financial issues and policies which have a&#13;
bearing on the Corporations financial position and risk-bearing capacity. The Audit Committee monitors the evolution of developments&#13;
in corporate governance and the role of audit committees on an ongoing basis and revised its terms of reference in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communications&#13;
The Audit Committee communicates regularly with the Board through distribution of the following:&#13;
&#13;
   The minutes of its meetings.&#13;
   Reports of the Audit Committee prepared by the Chairman, which document discussions held. These reports are distributed to the&#13;
   Directors, Alternates, World Bank Group Senior Management and Vice Presidents of IFC.&#13;
   "Statement(s) of the Chairman" and statements issued by other members of the Committee.&#13;
   The Annual Report to the Board, which provides an overview of the main issues addressed by the Audit Committee over the year.&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                                                                IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT 25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        The Audit Committees communications with the external auditor are described in the Auditor Independence section, below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Executive sessions&#13;
        Members of the Audit Committee may convene in executive session at any time, without management present. Under the Committees&#13;
        terms of reference, it meets separately in executive session with the external and internal auditors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Access to outside resources and to management&#13;
        Throughout the year, the Audit Committee receives a large volume of information, which supports the preparation of the financial&#13;
        statements. The Audit Committee meets both formally and informally throughout the year to discuss financial and accounting matters.&#13;
        Directors have complete access to the management of the Corporation. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management&#13;
        the quarterly and annual financial statements. The Committee also reviews with the external auditor the financial statements prior to&#13;
        their publication and recommends them for approval to the Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
        The Audit Committee has the capacity, under exceptional circumstances, to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal, accounting&#13;
        or other advisors as deemed appropriate.&#13;

        The World Bank Group strives to foster and maintain a positive work environment that supports the ethical behavior of its staff. To&#13;
        facilitate this effort, the World Bank Group has a Code of Professional Ethics in place. The Code (Code of Professional Ethics ­ Living&#13;
        our Values) applies to all staff (including managers, consultants, and temporary employees) worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
        The Code is available in nine languages on the World Bank Groups website, www.worldbank.org. Staff relations, conflicts of interest,&#13;
        and operational issues, including the accuracy of books and records, are key elements of the Code.&#13;
&#13;
        In addition to the Code, an essential element of appropriate conduct is compliance with the obligations embodied in the Principles of Staff&#13;
        Employment, Staff Rules, and Administrative Rules, the violation of which may result in disciplinary action. In accordance with the Staff&#13;
        Rules, senior managers must complete a confidential financial disclosure instrument with the Office of Ethics and Business Conduct.&#13;
&#13;
        Guidance for staff is also provided through programs, training materials, and other resources. Managers are responsible for ensuring that&#13;
        internal systems, policies, and procedures are consistently aligned with the World Bank Groups ethical goals. In support of its efforts on&#13;
        ethics, the World Bank offers a variety of methods for informing staff of these resources. Many of these efforts are headed by the&#13;
        following groups:&#13;
           The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct provides leadership, management and oversight for the World Bank Groups ethics&#13;
           infrastructure including the Ethics Help Line, a consolidated conflicts of interest disclosure/resolution system, financial disclosure,&#13;
           ongoing training to both internal and external audiences, and communication resources.&#13;
           The Department of Institutional Integrity is charged with investigating allegations of fraud and corruption with the World Bank Group.&#13;
           The Department also investigates allegations of misconduct by World Bank Group staff, and trains and educates staff and clients in&#13;
           detecting and reporting fraud and corruption in World Bank Group-funded projects. The Department reports directly to the President&#13;
           and is composed of professionals from a range of disciplines including financial analysts, researchers, investigators, lawyers,&#13;
           prosecutors, forensic accountants, and World Bank Group staff with operational experience.&#13;
&#13;
        The World Bank Group has in place procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received regarding accounting,&#13;
        internal controls and auditing matters.&#13;
&#13;
        The World Bank Group offers both the Ethics Help Line, and a Fraud and Corruption hotline run by an outside firm staffed by trained&#13;
        specialists. This third-party service offers numerous methods of communication in addition to a tollfree hotline in countries where access&#13;
        to telecommunications may be limited. In addition, there are other methods by which the Department of Institutional Integrity may&#13;
        receive allegations, including directly by email, anonymously, or through confidential submission through its website, as well as the&#13;
        postal service and telephone.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Auditor Independence&#13;
&#13;
In FY03, the Board adopted a set of principles applicable to the appointment of the external auditor for IFC. Key features of those&#13;
principles include:&#13;
&#13;
  Prohibition of the external auditor from the provision of all non audit-related services;&#13;
  All audit-related services must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Board, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee;&#13;
  Mandatory rebidding of the external audit contract every five years;&#13;
  Prohibition of any firm serving as external auditor for more than two consecutive five-year terms;&#13;
  Mandatory rotation of the senior partner after five years; and&#13;
  An evaluation of the performance of the external auditor at the mid-point of the five year term.&#13;
&#13;
In FY04, IFCs external auditor, Deloitte and Touche LLP, began a new five-year term and will have served eleven years as external&#13;
auditor upon completion of that term, pursuant to a one-time grandfathered exemption from the above-referenced ten-year limit. Even&#13;
within a five-year term the service of the external auditors is subject to recommendation by the Audit Committee for annual&#13;
reappointment and approval of a resolution by the Board.&#13;
&#13;
As a standard practice, the external auditor is present as an observer at virtually all Audit Committee meetings and is frequently asked to&#13;
present its perspective on issues. In addition, the Audit Committee meets periodically with the external auditor in private session without&#13;
management present. Communication between the external auditor and the Audit Committee is ongoing, as frequently as is deemed&#13;
necessary by either party. IFCs external auditors follow the communication requirements with audit committees set out under U.S.&#13;
generally accepted auditing standards. In keeping with these standards, significant formal communications include:&#13;
&#13;
  Quarterly and annual financial statement reporting;&#13;
  Annual appointment of the external auditors;&#13;
  Presentation of the external audit plan;&#13;
  Presentation of control recommendations and discussion of the COSO attestation and report; and&#13;
  Presentation of a statement regarding independence.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to Committee meetings, individual members of the Audit Committee have independent access to the external auditor.&#13;

&#13;
         PURPOSE&#13;
&#13;
         The International Finance Corporation (IFC or the Corporation), an international organization, was established in 1956 to further economic&#13;
         development in its member countries by encouraging the growth of private enterprise. The Corporation is a member of the World Bank Group,&#13;
         which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), and&#13;
         the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The Corporation's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall&#13;
         development objectives of the other World Bank Group institutions. The Corporation, together with private investors, assists in financing the&#13;
         establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector enterprises by making loans and equity investments where sufficient private capital&#13;
         is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. The Corporation also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project funding from other&#13;
         investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan participations, underwritings, and guarantees. In addition to project finance&#13;
         and resource mobilization, the Corporation offers an array of financial and technical advisory and corporate governance services to private&#13;
         businesses in the developing world to increase their chances of success. It also advises governments on how to create an environment&#13;
         hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and foreign investment. The Corporation's share capital is provided by its member countries. It&#13;
         raises most of the funds for its investment activities through the issuance of notes, bonds and other debt securities in the international capital&#13;
         markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         NOTE A ­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
         The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Corporation and two variable interest entities (VIE) created after&#13;
         December 31, 2003, in which the Corporation has been deemed to be the primary beneficiary (see Note W). The accounting and reporting&#13;
         policies of the Corporation conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). On July 28, 2005,&#13;
         the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved these financial statements for issue.&#13;
&#13;
         Financial statements presentation - Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.&#13;
&#13;
         Use of estimates - The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the&#13;
         reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the&#13;
         reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A significant degree of&#13;
         judgment has been used in the determination of: the adequacy of the reserve against losses on loans and impairment of equity investments;&#13;
         estimated fair values of all derivative instruments and related financial instruments in qualifying hedging relationships; and net periodic pension&#13;
         income. There are inherent risks and uncertainties related to the Corporation's operations. The possibility exists that changing economic&#13;
         conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
         The Corporation uses internal models to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments and the aggregate level of the&#13;
         reserve against losses on loans and impairment of equity investments. The Corporation undertakes continuous review and respecification of&#13;
         these models with the objective of refining its estimates, consistent with evolving best market practices. Changes in estimates resulting from&#13;
         refinements in the assumptions and methodologies incorporated in the models are reflected in net income in the period in which the enhanced&#13;
         models are first applied.&#13;
&#13;
         Translation of currencies - Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars (US dollars or $), other than disbursed equity&#13;
         investments, are expressed in US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004. Disbursed equity investments&#13;
         are expressed in US dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income and expenses are translated at the rates of&#13;
         exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction. Translation gains and losses are credited or charged to income.&#13;
&#13;
         Loans - The Corporation originates loans to facilitate project finance, restructuring, refinancing, corporate finance, and/or developmental impact.&#13;
         Loans are recorded as assets when disbursed. Loans are carried at the principal amounts outstanding. Where loans are part of a designated&#13;
         hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying value is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being&#13;
         hedged. These adjustments are reported in net gains and losses on other financial instruments in the income statement. It is the Corporation's&#13;
         practice to obtain collateral security such as, but not limited to, mortgages and third-party guarantees.&#13;
&#13;
         Revenue recognition on loans - Interest income and commitment fees on loans are recorded as income on an accrual basis. Loan origination&#13;
         costs are expensed as incurred. Loan origination fees are recognized in income when received. The net of loan origination fees and loan&#13;
         origination costs is considered insignificant. All other fees are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies. The&#13;
         Corporation does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60&#13;
         days unless management anticipates that collection of interest will occur in the near future. Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual&#13;
         status is reversed out of income and is thereafter recognized as income only when the actual payment is received. Interest not previously&#13;
         recognized but capitalized as part of a debt restructuring is recorded as deferred income, included in the balance sheet in payables and other&#13;
         liabilities, and credited to income only when the related principal is received. Such capitalized interest is considered in the computation of the&#13;
         reserve against losses on loans and equity investments in the balance sheet.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reserve against losses on loans - The Corporation recognizes portfolio impairment on loans in the balance sheet through the reserve against&#13;
losses on loans, recording a provision or release of provision for losses on loans in net income on a quarterly basis, which increases or&#13;
decreases the reserve against losses on loans.&#13;
&#13;
Management determines the aggregate level of the reserve against losses on loans, taking into account established guidelines and its&#13;
assessment of recent portfolio quality trends. The guidelines comprise simulation techniques, internal country risk ratings and the impairment&#13;
potential of the loan portfolio based on the Corporation's historical portfolio write-off and loss reserve experience on mature investments.&#13;
&#13;
The reserve against losses on loans reflects estimates of both probable losses already identified and probable losses inherent in the portfolio but&#13;
not specifically identifiable. The determination of identified probable losses represents management's judgment of the creditworthiness of the&#13;
borrower and is established through review of individual loans undertaken on a quarterly basis. The Corporation considers a loan as impaired&#13;
when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the&#13;
loan's contractual terms. Unidentified probable losses are the aggregate probable losses over a one-year risk horizon, in excess of identified&#13;
probable losses. The risks inherent in the portfolio that are considered in determining unidentified probable losses are those proven to exist by&#13;
past experience and include: country systemic risk; the risk of correlation or contagion of losses between markets; uninsured and uninsurable&#13;
risks; nonperformance under guarantees and support agreements; and opacity of, or misrepresentation in, financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Loans are written-off when the Corporation has exhausted all possible means of recovery, by reducing the reserve against losses on loans.&#13;
Such reductions in the reserve are offset by recoveries associated with previously written-off loans.&#13;
&#13;
Equity investments - The Corporation invests for current income, capital appreciation, developmental impact, or all three; the Corporation does&#13;
not take operational, controlling, or strategic equity positions within its investees. Equity investments are acquired through direct ownership of&#13;
equity instruments of investees and as a limited partner in limited liability partnerships (LLPs) and limited liability companies (LLCs).&#13;
&#13;
Revenue recognition on equity investments ­ Direct equity investments and certain investments in investment companies are carried at cost&#13;
less impairment. The Corporation enters into put and call option agreements in connection with equity investments; these are accounted for in&#13;
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133. The Corporation's investments in limited LLPs and LLCs that&#13;
maintain specific ownership accounts are accounted for under the equity method. Certain equity investments, for which recovery of invested&#13;
capital is uncertain, are accounted for under the cost recovery method, such that receipts of freely convertible currencies are first applied to&#13;
recovery of invested capital and then to capital gains. The cost recovery method is principally applied to the Corporation's investment in its&#13;
unincorporated oil and gas joint ventures.&#13;
&#13;
Dividends and profit participations received on cost method equity investments are generally recorded as income when received in freely&#13;
convertible currencies. Realized capital gains on the sale or redemption of equity investments are measured against the average cost of the&#13;
investments sold and are generally recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies or securities, which are readily convertible&#13;
into freely convertible currencies. Capital losses are recognized when incurred.&#13;
&#13;
Impairment of equity investments ­ Every cost method equity investment is assessed for impairment each quarter. When an impairment is&#13;
identified and is deemed to be other than temporary, the equity investment is written down to the impaired value, which becomes the new cost&#13;
basis in the equity investment. Impairment losses are not reversed for subsequent recoveries in value of the equity investment, until it is sold.&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees ­ The Corporation extends financial guarantee facilities to its clients to provide credit enhancement for their debt securities and&#13;
trade obligations. Beginning in the year ended June 30, 2001, the Corporation began offering partial credit guarantees to clients covering, on a&#13;
risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. Under the terms of the Corporation's guarantees, the Corporation agrees to assume&#13;
responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client (i.e., failure to pay when payment is due). Guarantees are&#13;
regarded as issued when the Corporation commits to the guarantee. This date is also the "inception" of the guarantee contract. Guarantees are&#13;
regarded as outstanding when the underlying financial obligation of the client is incurred, and called when the Corporation's obligation under the&#13;
guarantee has been invoked. There are two liabilities associated with the guarantees: (1) the stand-ready obligation to perform and (2) the&#13;
contingent liability. The stand-ready obligation to perform is recognized at the commitment date unless a contingent liability exists at that time or&#13;
is expected to exist in the near term. The contingent liability associated with the financial guarantees is recognized when it is probable the&#13;
guarantee will be called and when the amount of guarantee called can be reasonably estimated. All liabilities associated with guarantees are&#13;
included in payables and other liabilities, and the receivables are included in other assets on the balance sheet. When the guarantees are&#13;
called, the amount disbursed is recorded as a new loan, and specific reserves are established, based on the estimated probable loss. These&#13;
reserves are included in the reserve against losses on loans on the balance sheet. Guarantee fees are recorded in income as the stand-ready&#13;
obligation to perform is fulfilled. Commitment fees on guarantees are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Funding Mechanism for Technical Assistance and Advisory Services - In the year ended June 30, 2004, IFC established a funding&#13;
mechanism for technical assistance and advisory services. The funding mechanism is used to finance the Corporation's technical assistance&#13;
and advisory activities. Amounts designated for technical assistance and advisory services are determined based on the Corporation's annual&#13;
operating income in excess of $150 million, and contemplating the financial capacity and priorities of the Corporation. Expenditures for the&#13;
various approved technical assistance and advisory projects are recorded as expenses in the Corporation's income statement in the year in&#13;
which they occur and have the effect of reducing retained earnings designated for technical assistance and advisory services.&#13;
&#13;
Performance-Based Grants Initiative - In the year ended June 30, 2005, IFC began the analysis to create a program to fund performance-&#13;
based grants, targeted at specified industries in developing countries. Because the decision to proceed with this program was still under&#13;
review by the Board at June 30, 2005, IFC designated $250 million of retained earnings for the program, but has not yet allocated or disbursed&#13;
any amount under the program.&#13;

                                                    INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Liquid asset portfolio - The Corporation's liquid funds are invested in government and agency obligations, time deposits and asset-backed&#13;
         securities. Government and agency obligations include long and short positions in highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills, and other&#13;
         obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies and&#13;
         instrumentalities or by multilateral organizations. The liquid asset portfolio, as defined by the Corporation, consists of: time deposits and&#13;
         securities; related derivative instruments; securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements and&#13;
         payable for cash collateral received; receivables from sales of securities and payables for purchases of securities; and related accrued income&#13;
         and charges.&#13;
&#13;
         Trading securities are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in net gains and losses on trading activities. Interest on&#13;
         securities and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in interest from time deposits and securities.&#13;
&#13;
         The Corporation classifies due from banks, time deposits, and securities (collectively, cash and cash equivalents) as an element of liquidity in&#13;
         the statement of cash flows because they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash within 90 days.&#13;
&#13;
         Repurchase and resale agreements - Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously agrees&#13;
         to repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which a party purchases&#13;
         securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price.&#13;
&#13;
         It is the Corporation's policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale agreements, which are primarily liquid government&#13;
         securities. The market value of these securities is monitored and, within parameters defined in the agreements, additional collateral is obtained&#13;
         when their value declines. The Corporation also monitors its exposure with respect to securities sold under repurchase agreements and, in&#13;
         accordance with the terms of the agreements, requests the return of excess securities held by the counterparty when their value increases.&#13;
&#13;
         Repurchase and resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amount at which the&#13;
         securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under agreements to&#13;
         repurchase and securities payable for cash collateral received are recorded at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
         Borrowings - To diversify its access to funding and reduce its borrowing costs, the Corporation borrows in a variety of currencies and uses a&#13;
         number of borrowing structures, including foreign exchange rate-linked, inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. Generally, the Corporation&#13;
         simultaneously converts such borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowings through the use of currency and interest rate swap&#13;
         transactions. Under certain outstanding borrowing agreements, the Corporation is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its&#13;
         assets (other than purchase money security interests) without extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
         Borrowings are recorded at the amount repayable at maturity, adjusted for unamortized premium and unaccreted discount. Where borrowings&#13;
         are part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying amount is adjusted for changes in fair value&#13;
         attributable to the risk being hedged. Adjustments for changes in fair value attributable to hedged risks are reported in net gains and losses on&#13;
         other financial instruments in the income statement. Interest on borrowings and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are&#13;
         reported in charges on borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
         Risk management, derivative instruments, and hedge accounting -                     The Corporation enters into transactions in various derivative&#13;
         instruments for financial risk management purposes in connection with its principal business activities, including lending, client risk management,&#13;
         borrowing, liquid asset portfolio management and asset and liability management. The Corporation does not use derivatives for speculative,&#13;
         marketing or merchandising purposes.&#13;
&#13;
         All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Where they are not clearly&#13;
         and closely related to the host contract, certain derivative instruments embedded in loans, equity investments and market borrowing&#13;
         transactions entered into on or after January 1, 1999, are bifurcated from the host contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets and&#13;
         liabilities. The value at inception of such embedded derivatives is excluded from the carrying value of the host contracts on the balance sheet.&#13;
         Changes in fair values of derivative instruments used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are recorded in net gains and losses on&#13;
         trading activities. Changes in fair values of derivative instruments other than those used in liquid asset portfolio management activities are&#13;
         recorded in net gains (losses) on other financial instruments.&#13;
&#13;
         Subject to certain specific qualifying conditions in SFAS No. 133, a derivative instrument may be designated either as a hedge of the fair value&#13;
         of an asset or liability (fair value hedge), or as a hedge of the variability of cash flows of an asset or liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow&#13;
         hedge). For a derivative instrument qualifying as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument are reported in net&#13;
         income, together with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative&#13;
         instrument qualifying as a cash flow hedge, fair value gains or losses associated with the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive&#13;
         income and released to net income in the period(s) in which the effect on net income of the hedged item is recorded. Fair value gains and&#13;
         losses on a derivative instrument not qualifying as a hedge are reported in net income.&#13;
&#13;
         The Corporation has designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing and lending activities as fair value hedges. The Corporation&#13;
         generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying financial instruments hedged, in terms of currencies,&#13;
         maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features. However, the valuation methodologies applied to the derivative and the hedged&#13;
         financial instrument, as prescribed by SFAS No. 133, may differ. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships is recorded in&#13;
         net gains and losses on other financial instruments in the income statement.&#13;
&#13;
         The Corporation has not designated any hedging relationships as cash flow hedges.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The risk management policy for each of the Corporation's principal business activities and the accounting policies particular to them are&#13;
described below.&#13;
&#13;
Lending activities The Corporation's policy is to closely match the currency, rate basis, and maturity of its loans and borrowings. Derivative&#13;
instruments are used to convert the cash flows from fixed rate US dollar or non-US dollar loans into variable rate US dollars. The impact on net&#13;
income of changes in fair value of interest rate swaps qualifying for the shortcut method under SFAS No. 133 is exactly offset by a&#13;
corresponding adjustment to the fair value of the related loans. The Corporation has elected not to designate hedging relationships for all other&#13;
lending-related derivatives that do not qualify for the shortcut method.&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management activities The Corporation enters into derivatives transactions with its clients to help them hedge their own currency,&#13;
interest rate, or commodity risk, which, in turn, improves the overall quality of the Corporation's loan portfolio. To hedge the market risks that&#13;
arise from these transactions with clients, the Corporation enters into offsetting derivative transactions with matching terms with authorized&#13;
market counterparties. Changes in fair value of all derivatives associated with these activities are reflected currently in net income. Though&#13;
hedge accounting is not applicable to these activities, the matching of terms between the offsetting transactions minimizes the impact on net&#13;
income. Fees and spreads charged on these transactions are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities The Corporation issues debt securities in various capital markets with the objectives of minimizing its borrowing costs,&#13;
diversifying funding sources, and developing member countries' capital markets, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include&#13;
borrowings payable in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a&#13;
stock market index, a reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. The Corporation uses derivative&#13;
instruments with matching terms, primarily currency and interest rate swaps, to convert such borrowings into variable rate US dollar obligations,&#13;
consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy. The Corporation has designated the majority of derivatives associated with borrowing&#13;
activities as fair value hedges of the underlying borrowings. There are a small number of cash flow-like hedging transactions for which no hedge&#13;
relationship has been designated.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio management activities The Corporation manages the interest rate, currency and other market risks associated with certain&#13;
of the time deposits and securities in its liquid asset portfolio by entering into derivative transactions to convert the cash flows from those&#13;
instruments into variable rate US dollars, consistent with the Corporation's matched funding policy. The derivative instruments used include&#13;
short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate&#13;
futures and options. As the entire liquid asset portfolio is classified as a trading portfolio, all securities (including derivatives) are carried at fair&#13;
value, and no hedging relationships have been designated.&#13;
&#13;
Asset and liability management In addition to the risk managed in the context of its business activities detailed above, the Corporation faces&#13;
residual market risk in its overall asset and liability management. Residual currency risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate position in&#13;
each lending currency and eliminating the net excess asset or liability position through spot sales or purchases. Interest rate risk due to reset&#13;
date mismatches is reduced by synchronizing the reset dates on assets and liabilities and managing overall interest rate risk on an aggregate&#13;
basis. Interest rate risk arising from mismatches due to writedowns, prepayments and reschedulings, and residual reset date mismatches, is&#13;
monitored by measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation monitors the credit risk associated with these activities by careful assessment and monitoring of prospective and actual clients&#13;
and counterparties. In respect of liquid assets and derivatives transactions, credit risk is managed by establishing exposure limits based on the&#13;
credit rating and size of the individual counterparty. In addition, the Corporation has entered into master agreements governing derivative&#13;
transactions that contain close-out and netting provisions and collateral arrangements. Under these agreements, if the Corporation's credit&#13;
exposure to a counterparty, on a mark-to-market basis, exceeds a specified level, the counterparty must post collateral to cover the excess,&#13;
generally in the form of liquid government securities.&#13;
&#13;
Resource mobilization - The Corporation mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other financial institutions (Participants) by facilitating&#13;
loan participations, without recourse. These loan participations are administered and serviced by the Corporation on behalf of the Participants.&#13;
The disbursed and outstanding balances of the loan participations are not included in the Corporation's balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Pension and other postretirement benefits - IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP)&#13;
and a Post-Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of the Corporation and of&#13;
MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to&#13;
eligible retirees. The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans are allocated&#13;
between IBRD, the Corporation, and MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. In addition, the Corporation and&#13;
MIGA reimburse IBRD for their share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
The net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense allocated to the Corporation is included in expense from pension&#13;
and other postretirement benefits, respectively, in the income statement. The Corporation includes a receivable from IBRD in receivables and&#13;
other assets, representing prepaid pension and other postretirement benefit costs.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting and financial reporting developments - In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB&#13;
Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ­ an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). During December 2003, FASB&#13;
replaced FIN 46 with FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ­ an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R). FIN&#13;
46 and FIN 46R define certain "variable interest entities" (VIEs) and require parties to such entities to assess and measure variable interests in&#13;
the VIEs for the purpose of determining possible consolidation of the VIEs. Variable interests can arise from financial instruments, service&#13;
contracts, guarantees, leases or other arrangements with VIE. An entity that will absorb a majority of VIE's expected losses or expected&#13;

                                                                                                                                        IFC 2005 ANNUAL REPORT 41&#13;

&#13;
                       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         residual returns is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and must include the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the VIE&#13;
         in its consolidated financial statements. Enterprises are required to apply the provisions of FIN 46 to VIEs created after January 31, 2003.&#13;
         Entities with an interest in an entity that is subject to FIN 46R and that is created after December 31, 2003 are required to apply the provisions&#13;
         of FIN 46R and related FSPs to that entity immediately. Nonpublic entities are required to apply the provisions of FIN 46R to all entities that&#13;
         are subject to FIN 46R by the beginning of the first annual period beginning after December 15, 2004. IFC applied FIN 46 to entities created&#13;
         after January 31, 2003 and applied FIN 46R to entities created after December 31, 2003.&#13;
&#13;
         As a result of its analysis, the Corporation identified two VIEs in which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The assets, liabilities and the&#13;
         results of operations of the two VIEs have been included in IFC's consolidated financial statements. In addition to the VIEs in which IFC is&#13;
         deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the Corporation has significant variable interest in certain other VIEs that are not consolidated because&#13;
         the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary.&#13;
&#13;
         Pursuant to the requirements for nonpublic entities (nonpublic entities as defined in SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based&#13;
         Compensation), IFC is required to apply the provisions of FIN 46R to entities created before January 31, 2003 in its financial statements for&#13;
         the year ending June 30, 2006. As a result, the Corporation expects to include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of three&#13;
         additional VIE's in which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Given the combined size of these VIEs, the impact is not expected to be&#13;
         material to the Corporation's results of operations, cash flow or financial position. The Corporation has also identified a number of investments&#13;
         in which it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary but it is reasonably possible that IFC could be deemed to hold a significant variable&#13;
         interest in the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
         Note W provides further details regarding the Corporation's variable interests in VIEs.&#13;
&#13;
         Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-16, Accounting for Investments in Limited Liability Companies expanded the use of the&#13;
         equity method to investments held in LLCs which maintain separate ownership accounts and in which the investor's investment is in excess of&#13;
         3-5%. EITF 03-16 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2004. The Corporation does have investments in LLCs, which&#13;
         maintain separate ownership accounts, and has adopted the equity method of accounting for those investments.&#13;
&#13;
         FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No.20 and FASB Statement No.3. The&#13;
         Corporation has elected to early adopt SFAS No. 154 as of July 1, 2005. The adoption will have no material impact on the Corporation's results&#13;
         of operations, cash flows or financial position as to that date.&#13;
&#13;
         FASB issued SFAS No.153, Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets, as amendment of APB Opinion No.29, which requires nonmonetary exchanges,&#13;
         which have commercial substance to be accounted for at fair value. The Corporation elected to early adopt SFAS No.153 as of April 1, 2005.&#13;
         The adoption had no material impact on the Corporation's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.&#13;
&#13;
         In September 2004, FASB postponed certain paragraphs pertaining to the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of&#13;
         Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03-1 was issued to clarify the meaning of "other-than-&#13;
         temporary impairment" and its application to investments classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under SFAS No. 115,&#13;
         Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (including individual securities and investments in mutual funds), and&#13;
         investments accounted for under the cost method. Though part of EITF 03-1 was deferred, certain sections of the guidance were adopted by&#13;
         IFC, specifically those sections related to disclosures.&#13;
&#13;
         In June 2004, FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on Issue No. 02-14, Whether an Investor Should&#13;
         Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock If the Investor Has the Ability to Exercise Significant&#13;
         Influence Over the Operating and Financial Policies of the Investee. EITF 02-14 defines features of certain financial instruments which are&#13;
         deemed to be "in substance" common shares, and which, therefore, must be included in the investor's analysis of total investment in an&#13;
         investee company for purposes of determining if the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. EITF 02-14&#13;
         was effective for IFC beginning October 1, 2004. The impact of adopting EITF 02-14 was not material to the Corporation's results of&#13;
         operations, financial position and cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
         The US Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued, and FASB ratified, Statement of Position (SOP) 03-3, Accounting for Certain&#13;
         Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer (SOP 03-3). The Corporation will adopt SOP 03-3 as of July 1, 2005, and the adoption is not&#13;
         expected to have a material impact on the Corporation's results of operations, cash flows or financial position as of June 30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
         In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2005, FASB issued and/or approved various FASB Staff Positions, EITF Issues Notes, and other&#13;
         interpretative guidance related to Statements of Financial Accounting Standards and APB Opinions. The Corporation analyzed and implemented&#13;
         the new guidance, as appropriate, with no material impact on either the financial position or results of operations of the Corporation.&#13;

       NOTE D ­ GUARANTEES&#13;
&#13;
       Under the terms of the Corporation's guarantees, the Corporation agrees to assume responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the&#13;
       event of default by the client, where default is defined as failure to pay when payment is due. Guarantees entered into by the Corporation&#13;
       generally have maturities consistent with those of the loan portfolio. Guarantees signed at June 30, 2005 totaled $998 million ($886 million ­&#13;
       June 30, 2004). Guarantees of $291 million that were outstanding at June 30, 2005 ($315 million ­ June 30, 2004) were not included in loans on&#13;
       the Corporation's Balance Sheet. The outstanding amount represents the maximum amount of undiscounted future payments that the&#13;
       Corporation could be required to make under these guarantees.&#13;

&#13;
       Dividends and profit participations include $106 million ($65 million - year ended June 30, 2004, and $61 million - year ended June 30, 2003) of&#13;
       receipts received in freely convertible cash, net of cash disbursements, in respect of investments accounted for under the cost recovery method.&#13;
&#13;
       Unrealized income from LLPs and certain LLCs results from the implementation of EITF 03-16 during the year ending June 30, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
       The Corporation assesses all equity investments each quarter for impairment. Prior to March 31, 2005, the Corporation had carried reserves&#13;
       against losses on the equity investment portfolio. During the year ended June 30, 2005, the Corporation changed its process of estimating&#13;
       impairment on equity investments to adopt an impairment methodology based largely on fair value estimates. As a result, the Corporation&#13;
       recorded a change in carrying value of the equity investment portfolio. In this regard, the Corporation determined that all impairments and&#13;
       changes in carrying value were deemed to be other than temporary. This change in carrying value of the equity portfolio has been reflected in&#13;
       net income from equity investments in the income statement and in equity investments in the balance sheet.&#13;

NOTE P ­ DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Many of the Corporation's financial instruments are not actively traded in any market. Accordingly, estimates and present value calculations of&#13;
future cash flows are used to estimate the fair values. Determining future cash flows for fair value estimation is subjective and imprecise, and&#13;
minor changes in assumptions or methodologies may materially affect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting from the difference&#13;
between the carrying amounts and the fair values presented does not necessarily reflect the realizable values, since the Corporation generally&#13;
holds loans, borrowings and other financial instruments to maturity with the aim of realizing their recorded values.&#13;
&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004. In different interest rate environments,&#13;
the fair value of the Corporation's financial assets and liabilities could differ significantly, especially the fair value of certain fixed rate financial&#13;
instruments. Reasonable comparability of fair values among financial institutions is not likely, because of the wide range of permitted valuation&#13;
techniques and numerous estimates that must be made in the absence of secondary market prices. This lack of objective pricing standards&#13;
introduces a greater degree of subjectivity and volatility to these derived or estimated fair values. Therefore, while disclosure of estimated fair&#13;
values of financial instruments is required, readers are cautioned in using these data for purposes of evaluating the financial condition of the&#13;
Corporation. The fair values of the individual financial instruments do not represent the fair value of the Corporation taken as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estimate fair values as of June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004 are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid assets - The estimated fair value of time deposits and the trading securities portfolio are based on quoted market prices and the present&#13;
value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Derivative instruments - Fair values for covered forwards were derived by using quoted market forward exchange rates. Fair values for other&#13;
derivative instruments were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Loans and loan commitments - The Corporation generally has not sold its loans from the portfolio, and there is no comparable secondary&#13;
market. Fair values for fixed rate loans and loan commitments were determined using a discounted cash flow model based on a discount rate&#13;
comprising the fixed rate loan spread plus the year-end estimated cost of funds. Since rates on variable rate loans and loan commitments are&#13;
generally reset on a quarterly or semiannual basis, the carrying value adjusted for credit risk was determined to be the best estimate of fair&#13;
value. The Corporation also holds options to convert loans into equity of certain of its investee companies. Fair values of these conversion&#13;
options are based on quoted market prices or other calculated values of the underlying equity investment.&#13;
&#13;
Equity investments - Fair values of equity investments accounted for at cost less impairment were determined using market prices where&#13;
available, put option prices, book values or cost, certain of which were discounted based upon management's estimate of net realizable value.&#13;
Where market prices were not available or alternate valuation techniques were not practical, cost was determined to be the best estimate of fair&#13;
value. Investments in LLPs and certain LLCs are not included as they are accounted for under the equity method.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings - Fair values were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;

NOTE Q ­ CURRENCY POSITION&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation conducts its operations for its loans, time deposits and securities and borrowings in multiple currencies. The Corporation's&#13;
policy is to minimize the level of currency risk by closely matching the currency of its assets (other than equity investments and quasi-equity&#13;
investments) and liabilities by using hedging instruments. The Corporation's equity investments in enterprises located in its developing member&#13;
countries are typically made in the local currency of the country. As a matter of policy, the Corporation carries the currency risk of equity&#13;
investments and quasi-equity investments and funds these investments from its capital and retained earnings.&#13;

        NOTE R ­ SEGMENT REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
        For management purposes, the Corporation's business comprises two segments: client services and treasury services. The client services&#13;
        segment consists primarily of lending and equity investment activities. Operationally, the treasury services segment consists of the borrowing,&#13;
        liquid asset management, asset and liability management and client risk management activities. Consistent with internal reporting, net income&#13;
        (expense) from asset and liability management and client risk management activities in support of client services are allocated to client services&#13;
        segment.&#13;
&#13;
        The assessment of segment performance by senior management includes net income for each segment, return on assets, and return on capital&#13;
        employed. The Corporation's management reporting system and policies are used to determine revenues and expenses attributable to each&#13;
        segment. Consistent with internal reporting, administrative expenses are allocated to each segment based largely upon personnel costs and&#13;
        segment head counts. Transactions between segments are immaterial and, thus, are not a factor in reconciling to the consolidated data.&#13;
&#13;
        The accounting policies of the Corporation's segments are, in all material respects, consistent with those described in note A, "Summary of&#13;
        Significant Accounting and Related Policies."&#13;

&#13;
        NOTE S ­ PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
        The Corporation, IBRD, and MIGA participate in a defined benefit SRP, a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP), and a Post-Employment Benefits&#13;
        Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of their staff members.&#13;
&#13;
        The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to&#13;
        eligible retirees. The PEBP provides certain pension benefits administered outside the SRP.&#13;
&#13;
        The Corporation uses a June 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.&#13;
&#13;
        The amounts presented below reflect the Corporation's respective share of the costs, assets, and liabilities of the plans.&#13;
&#13;
        All costs, assets, and liabilities associated with these plans are allocated between the Corporation, IBRD, and MIGA based upon their&#13;
        employees' respective contributions to the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost-&#13;
        sharing ratio. The Corporation, IDA, and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
        Contributions to these plans are calculated as a percentage of salary.&#13;

&#13;
The expenses for the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP are included in STET expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans.&#13;
&#13;
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, June 30, 2004, and June 30, 2003, expenses for these plans of $16 million, $20 million and $24&#13;
million, respectively, were allocated to IFC. The Corporation's net expense for these plans reported in the income statement was $14 million,&#13;
$19 million, and $24 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, June 30, 2004, and June 30, 2003, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
The following table summarizes the benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status associated with the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP for the&#13;
Corporation for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, June 30, 2004, and June 30, 2003 (US$ millions). Since the assets for the PEBP are not&#13;
held in an irrevocable trust separate from the assets of IBRD, they do not qualify for off-balance sheet accounting and are therefore included in&#13;
IBRD's investment portfolio. IFC has recognized a receivable (prepaid asset) from IBRD and a payable (liability) to IBRD equal to the amount&#13;
required to support the plan. The assets of the PEBP are invested in fixed income instruments.&#13;

        Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
        The actuarial assumptions used are based on financial market interest rates, past experience, and management's best estimate of future benefit&#13;
        changes and economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations.&#13;
&#13;
        The expected long-term rate of return for the SRP assets is a weighted average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for the&#13;
        various asset classes, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed using a forward-looking building block approach&#13;
        and are not strictly based on historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings&#13;
        growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk&#13;
        premium/spread (as appropriate). Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to equity and bond markets. The expected long-&#13;
        term rate of return for the RSBP is computed using procedures similar to those used for the SRP. The discount rate used in determining the&#13;
        benefit obligation is selected by reference to the year-end AAA and AA corporate bonds.&#13;
&#13;
        Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual results are different from expected results. Amortization of these unrecognized gains and losses&#13;
        will be included in income if, at the beginning of the fiscal year, they exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the&#13;
        market-related value of plan assets. If required, the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the expected average remaining service&#13;
        lives of the employee group.&#13;
&#13;
        The following tables present the weighted-average assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic&#13;
        pension costs for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, June 30, 2004, and June 30, 2003:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        Investment Strategy&#13;
&#13;
        The investment policy for the SRP and the RSBP is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the respective plan's needs and&#13;
        goals, using a global diversified portfolio of various asset classes. Specifically, the long-term asset allocation is based on an analysis that&#13;
        incorporates expected returns by asset class as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes and the liability profile of the respective&#13;
        plans. This analysis, referred to as an asset-liability analysis, also provides estimates of potential future contributions and future asset and&#13;
        liability balances. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers and monitored by IBRD's pension investment department. The&#13;
        pension plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of public equity, fixed income, and alternative investments. The fixed-income and public&#13;
        equity asset classes are rebalanced on a monthly basis.&#13;

Expected Contributions&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation's contribution to the SRP and RSBP varies from year to year, as determined by the Pension Finance Committee, which bases&#13;
its judgment on the results of annual actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities of the SRP and RSBP. The best estimate of the amount of&#13;
contributions expected to be paid to the SRP and RSBP for the Corporation during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2005 is $47 million and&#13;
$12 million, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE T ­ SERVICE AND SUPPORT PAYMENTS&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be efficiently&#13;
provided by IBRD. This includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as communications, internal&#13;
auditing, administrative support, supplies, and insurance. The Corporation makes payments for these services to IBRD based on negotiated&#13;
fees, chargebacks and allocated charges, where chargeback is not feasible. Expenses allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30,&#13;
2005, were $25 million ($21 million - year ended June 30, 2004; $19 million - year ended June 30, 2003).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE U ­ TRUST FUNDS&#13;
&#13;
The Corporation uses the services of IBRD to administer funds on behalf of donors that are restricted for specific uses, including technical&#13;
assistance, feasibility studies and project preparation, global and regional programs and research and training programs. These funds are&#13;
placed in trust and are not included in the Corporation's assets. The responsibilities of the Corporation are to arrange for services generally not&#13;
otherwise provided by it, including full project implementation and procurement of goods and services. The distribution of Trust Fund assets by&#13;
executing agent is as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
                                                                          June 30, 2005                                  June 30, 2004&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         NOTE V ­ CONTINGENCIES&#13;
&#13;
         In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is from time to time named as a defendant or co-defendant in various legal actions on&#13;
         different grounds in various jurisdictions. Although there can be no assurances, based on the information currently available, the Corporation's&#13;
         Management does not believe the outcome of any of the various existing legal actions will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's&#13;
         financial condition or results of operations.&#13;
&#13;
         NOTE W ­ VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES&#13;
&#13;
         An entity is subject to FIN 46R and is called a variable interest entity (VIE) if it has: (1) equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance&#13;
         its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or (2) equity investors that lack decision-making rights about&#13;
         the entity's operations or the equity holders that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity proportionally&#13;
         to their voting rights.&#13;
&#13;
         A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party involved with the VIE that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or&#13;
         receives a majority of the expected residual returns or both. The primary beneficiary is required to initially measure the assets, liabilities and&#13;
         noncontrolling interests of the VIE at their carrying amounts at the date on which it first became the primary beneficiary. Because certain VIEs&#13;
         were created prior to the issuance of FIN 46R, it may not be practicable to determine the carrying amounts of the assets, liabilities and&#13;
         noncontrolling interests at the initial date, and in such cases, the primary beneficiary must measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling&#13;
         interests at their fair values on the date FIN 46R is first applied. The primary beneficiary is also required to disclose information about the&#13;
         nature, purpose, size, and activities of the VIE, and collateral and recourse creditors may have against the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
         An enterprise may hold significant variable interests in VIEs, which are not consolidated because the enterprise is not the primary beneficiary.&#13;
          In such cases, the enterprise is required to disclose information about its involvement with and exposure to the VIE, and about the nature,&#13;
         purpose, size, and activities of the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
         An enterprise is not required to apply FIN 46R to certain entities if, after making an exhaustive effort, it is unable to obtain the information&#13;
         necessary to: (1) determine whether the entity is a VIE; (2) determine if the enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the possible VIE; or&#13;
         (3) perform the accounting required to consolidate a possible VIE. In such cases, the enterprise is required to disclose the number of entities&#13;
         to which FIN 46R is not being applied, why the information required to apply FIN 46R is not available, the nature, purpose and activities of the&#13;
         entities to which FIN 46R is not being applied, and the enterprise's maximum exposure to the entities to which FIN 46R is not being applied.&#13;
&#13;
         The Corporation is required to apply the provisions of FIN 46R to entities created on or after January 1, 2004 in its financial statements for the&#13;
         year ended June 30, 2005, and to entities created before January 1, 2004 in its financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2006.&#13;
&#13;
         The Corporation has identified two VIEs, created after January 1, 2004, in which the Corporation is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.&#13;

         The two entities have been consolidated into IFC's financial statements as of June 30, 2005. The two entities are securitization vehicles in the&#13;
         Finance and Insurance sector in the Latin America and Caribbean Region. IFC has issued a financial guarantee against the senior debt&#13;
         securities of the securitization vehicles. The securitization vehicles meet the definition of a VIE. Accordingly, the financial guarantees issued&#13;
         by IFC have been deemed to absorb the majority of the expected losses of the securitization vehicles, and IFC is, therefore, deemed to be the&#13;
         primary beneficiary. As a result of the consolidation, IFC has included assets of $131 million in receivables and other assets and liabilities of&#13;
         $131 million in payables and other liabilities in its balance sheet; there was no material impact on the Corporation's results of operations or&#13;
         cash flows associated with the consolidation.&#13;
&#13;
         The Corporation has also identified three VIEs, created before January 1, 2004, in which IFC is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. These&#13;
         three entities will be consolidated into IFC's financial statements beginning in the year ending June 30, 2006. IFC's net investment in these&#13;
         three entities totals $2 million and, accordingly, consolidation of these entities beginning in the year ending June 30, 2006 is expected to have&#13;
         no material impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of IFC.&#13;

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition, based on the exhaustive review of its loan, equity and guarantee portfolio, the Corporation has identified 34 investments in VIEs in&#13;
which the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary, but in which it is reasonably possible the Corporation could be deemed to hold significant&#13;
variable interests. The Corporation's total investment in these entities, comprising disbursed and committed but undisbursed balances, which&#13;
correspond to the maximum exposure to loss the Corporation has as a result of its involvement, was $195 million at June 30, 2005. The&#13;
regional and sectoral analysis of the Corporation's investments in these VIEs is as follows (US$ millions):&#13;

This table includes technical assistance and advisory projects active during FY05. This work is supported by various donors, including&#13;
IFC itself.&#13;
     Many projects in the table are carried out by a network of 24 facilities managed by IFC; some serve a developing region, while&#13;
others emphasize a specific aspect of development. Many facilities, including most of the regional project development facilities, fund&#13;
their activities from a pool of core funds raised from a group of donors; other facilities, such as the Private Enterprise Partnership, raise&#13;
donor funds specifically for individual projects and initiatives.&#13;
     In addition to the facilities, IFC manages trust funds on behalf of many donor governments to support technical assistance work.&#13;
During FY05, IFC also established the Funding Mechanism for Technical Assistance and Advisory Services, which uses a portion of the&#13;
Corporation's retained earnings to support specific activities.&#13;

1.  Commitments are composed of funds to be provided by IFC for its own account, funds to be provided by participants through the purchase of an interest in IFC's investment, and funds to be provided&#13;
    by other financial institutions in association with IFC, where IFC has rendered material assistance in mobilizing these funds. Cumulative commitments are composed of disbursed and undisbursed&#13;
    balances. The undisbursed portion is revalued at current exchange rates, while the disbursed portion represents the cost of commitment at the time of disbursement. From FY04 forward, the Corporation&#13;
    includes guarantee and risk management products in commitments.&#13;
2.  Of this amount, $9.8 million represents investments made at a time when the authorities on Taiwan represented China in the International Finance Corporation. The balance represents investments&#13;
    in West Bank and Gaza.&#13;

At IFC our mandate is to further sustainable&#13;
economic development through the private sector.&#13;
We pursue this goal through innovative solutions&#13;
to the challenges of development, as we invest in&#13;
companies and financial institutions in emerging&#13;
markets and as we help build business skills. We&#13;
consider positive development impact an integral&#13;
part of good business, and we focus much of our&#13;
effort on the countries with the greatest need for&#13;
investment. We recognize that economic growth&#13;
is sustainable only if it is environmentally and&#13;
socially sound and helps improve the quality of&#13;
life for those living in developing countries.&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2005 : investing in progress with experience,
            innovation, and partnership
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report for the fiscal year 2005
            concerns the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which
            demonstrated a third consecutive year of record growth,
            owing to the strong economic performance of many developing
            member countries. The financial results set the stage for a
            planned expansion in IFC's investments and advisory
            services. The report outlines the strategic objectives of
            the institution in expanding access to finance, increasing
            private participation in key sectors, helping successful
            enterprises grow, focusing where needs are greatest, and
            ensuring sustainability. The organization is at the
            forefront of private sector development by redefining how
            poverty can be reduced and by improving a stronger private
            sectors in emerging markets. Accomplishing this goal means
            reaching people, regions, and sectors that have not yet
            shared in the overall growth of emerging markets. It means
            innovation, forging new partnerships with governments and
            other multilateral institutions, identifying new roles for
            the private sector, creating products that develop financial
            markets, and making it easier for disadvantaged people to
            launch a business or own a home. It means building on
            significant strengths in many countries and
            industries-helping established enterprises become more
            competitive and sustainable as they expand their operations
            or extend their reach into new markets. It also means
            bringing to developing economies proven products and
            techniques, both from industrialized countries and,
            increasingly, from other developing countries. Above all it
            means tailoring global expertise to local needs.
