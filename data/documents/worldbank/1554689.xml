FOREWORD&#13;
Centrally planned economies (CPEs) account for a significant share of&#13;
the world's production and income.     In view of their importance in the world&#13;
economy, and to facilitate international comparative analysis, for many years&#13;
the World Bank has included statistical data on these countries in those of&#13;
its publications that aim for universal coverage, such as The World Bank&#13;
Atlas.   Among these data, those relating to gross national product (GNP) and&#13;
to GNP per capita are the most important, and the Bank also needs them for&#13;
operational purposes for its member countries, which now include some CPEs.&#13;
In the CPEs prices are generally set administratively and are often&#13;
loosely or not at all related to the relative scarcity and costs of production&#13;
of goods and services.    This is particularly true of the exchange rate.      The&#13;
World Bank normally uses exchange rates for converting GNP figures from&#13;
national   currencies   into   dollars  (or   into  any   other   numeraire),   an&#13;
indispensable   step   for  international   comparisons.     The  choice   of  an&#13;
appropriate conversion factor therefore poses particularly difficult problems&#13;
for most CPEs.   A further difficulty arises because the national accounts of&#13;
the CPEs are based on the concept of net material product (NMP), which differs&#13;
from the concept of GNP used in market economies.      To derive the GNP numbers&#13;
of those CPEs that compile only NMP accounts, various adjustments must be&#13;
made.   The data required for making these adjustments are not always fully&#13;
available.   Finally, a separate set of issues arises in relation to year to&#13;
year comparisons within the same CPE.      For these too and the corresponding&#13;
growth rates, official data are not strictly comparable to growth rates of the&#13;
market economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In early 1982 a research project sponsored and financed by the World&#13;
Bank was undertaken to assess alternative methods of computing the per capita&#13;
dollar GNP levels and growth rates of CPEs.        It covered eight countries:&#13;
Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary,&#13;
Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R.    The purpose of this research project was to&#13;
define the best among known methods that could be applied to CPEs as a group&#13;
and make use of available data.     It was not its aim to establish and define&#13;
new computation methods whose application would have required many more years&#13;
of effort, even if data had been available.&#13;
-    This  research   project  has  produced   eleven  reports,  which   are&#13;
published   simultaneously.    The  main   report  authored  by   the  principal&#13;
researcher for the project, Paul Marer, is published as a book, Dollar GNPs of&#13;
the USSR and Eastern Europe (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985). The eight&#13;
country studies and two background papers are published separately in the&#13;
World Bank Staff Working Paper series.        The main report provides highly&#13;
valuable insights into the problems related to the estimation and comparison&#13;
of the GNPs and GNP growth rates of the CPEs. It also gives the author's best&#13;
estimates of the actual values of these indicators for the majority of CPEs&#13;
covered by the project, that is those for which there was some statistical&#13;
basis for computing estimates or choosing between those already available.&#13;
The main report on the Research Project on CPEs concludes that&#13;
adequate GNP data in national currencies can be derived for most CPEs by&#13;
adjusting official information about net material product in the light of&#13;
statistical  and other information known to country experts.         It further&#13;
concludes that the best method generally applicable to CPEs for converting&#13;
such GNP data from local currencies into dollars would use conversion rates&#13;
based upon purchasing power parity (PPP) information.       For comparison with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
corresponding World Bank data on other World Bank members, these conversion&#13;
rates should be adjusted to correct for the expected differences between the&#13;
PPP rates and the actual official exchange rates (the "exchange rate deviation&#13;
index"). The needed adjustments are estimated econometrically from the actual&#13;
differences observed at each level of per capita GNP among the thirty-one&#13;
market economies participating in Phase III (1975) of the International&#13;
Comparison Project (ICP).    For Hungary, Romania, and Poland, PPP information&#13;
is derived from Phase III (1975) of the ICP, while for Czechoslovakia, the&#13;
German Democratic Republic, and the U.S.S.R., it is derived from private&#13;
bilateral comparisons chain-linked to the ICP data.       This method yields a&#13;
range of per capita GNP estimates: for example, $2,700 to $5,700 with a&#13;
midpoint of $4,190, for the U.S.S.R. in 1980.    No PPP estimate was available,&#13;
and no GNP per capita figure in US dollars calculated, for Bulgaria and Cuba.&#13;
The main report also concludes that the official estimates of growth&#13;
rates of the CPEs "tend to yield varying degrees of upward bias."        For all&#13;
countries except Hungary, the experts lean toward preferring alternative&#13;
indices, constructed by outside experts with partial information, although&#13;
these too present problems (especially for countries other than the U.S.S.R.)&#13;
and the experts therefore fell short of endorsing them.       The author of the&#13;
study on Hungary leans toward preferring the official index at this time.&#13;
The country studies and background papers that are being issued in&#13;
the World Bank Staff Working Paper series provide additional details on the&#13;
CPEs studied and their exchange rates.     Some of the country studies include&#13;
the respective authors' estimates of per capita GNP in U.S. dollars.       These&#13;
estimates, however, are the individual authors' experimental computations,&#13;
based on methods that may not be consistently applicable to CPEs generally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There remain major uncertainties about GNP conversions by means of&#13;
"adjusted PPPs." In addition to numerous remaining theoretical .and practical&#13;
problems  associated   with  calculating  PPPs  within   the  framework  of  the&#13;
centrally coordinated ICP, private estimates such as those used in this study&#13;
for three CPEs still appear to be subject to a wide margin of error.&#13;
Furthermore, there is no other way to estimate the exchange rate deviation&#13;
index than to derive it from observation of the countries covered by the ICP&#13;
(almost all of which are market economies).      The applicability of an index&#13;
derived in this fashion to the CPEs, whose economic structures are very&#13;
different, remains subject to reservations.&#13;
The present study used ICP Phase III data relating to the year 1975,&#13;
extrapolated to 1980.    Phase IV ICP data already published shows estimates&#13;
directly relating to 1980 for European countries, including Hungary and&#13;
Poland; Romania, a participant in early phases of the ICP, has not pr9vided&#13;
the data needed for participation in Phase IV. It is noteworthy that Phase IV&#13;
estimates of Hungary's and Poland's per capita GNP in 1980 are lower than the&#13;
1975 results extrapolated to 1980, used by the Research Report on CPEs. These&#13;
differences are partly due to the greater attention paid in Phase IV to&#13;
quality differences and to other methodological advances.&#13;
During the course of 1983 the Bank, with the help of a distinguished&#13;
panel of experts, 1/ undertook a review of the methodological problems and&#13;
issues related to the estimation of internationally comparable per capita GNP&#13;
figures for all countries. The preliminary results of the research project on&#13;
CPEs constituted an important input into that review, whose findings and&#13;
1/ Abram Bergson, Harvard University, Chairman; Andre Vanoli, Institut&#13;
National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques; and Parmeet Singh,&#13;
Commonwealth Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recommendations were approved by the panel of experts.         In light of the&#13;
review; the Bank has decided that. for the time being (that is, at least until&#13;
data availability and other problems related to PPP information are resolved),&#13;
official GNP information converted at official exchange rates should generally&#13;
continue to provide the basis of the per capita GNP estimates published in The&#13;
World Bank Atlas.   Exceptions to this rule are to be made only when official&#13;
GNP data, in national currency, is exceptionally bad or compiled in ways which&#13;
diverge in an exceptionally large measure from the usual methods and&#13;
standards, or when the official exchange rate is exceptionally far removed&#13;
from the rate effectively governing foreign payments transactions. When there&#13;
is a reason to believe that such exceptional circumstances prevail, and&#13;
adequate information exists, appropriate adjustments are to be made.        When&#13;
adequate information does not exist and cannot be obtained, no estimates are&#13;
to be published.   At the time of writing this foreword, it seems likely that&#13;
lack of information will for some time prevent the Bank from making estimates&#13;
of the per capita GNP of most CPEs.     Thus The World Bank Atlas published in&#13;
early 1985 contains an estimate of the values of GNP and GNP per capita for&#13;
only one European CPE, Hungary.&#13;
Following the review endorsed by the panel of experts, the World Bank&#13;
has adopted calculation methods and obtained results which, for a few&#13;
countries, are different from those of the research project of CPEs.         The&#13;
Bank's general methodology must be applicable to all its member countries,&#13;
including most market economies and only a few CPEs; the Bank could demand&#13;
that its member countries provide additional information when needed; and it'&#13;
could, and did, decide not to estimate the per capita GNP of countries for&#13;
which a minimal, but still fairly extensive set of information could not be&#13;
obtained.   As noted earlier, however, the research project on CPEs has aimed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
at defining a method consistently applicable to all CPEs and one that could&#13;
make use of available information.    These differences in aims and constraints&#13;
readily explain the differences in results.&#13;
The research project on CPEs, whose major findings are published in&#13;
the main report, has greatly enhanced the understanding of the CPEs' unique&#13;
macroeconomic accounting frameworks and pricing systems.        It has provided&#13;
insight into many substantive issues, in particular the relationship of&#13;
domestic and international prices.    The individual country reports, published&#13;
separately, shed much light on many important country-specific issues.       The&#13;
Bank will continue to build upon the valuable findings of the research project&#13;
on CPEs in its future efforts to understand these important components of the&#13;
global economy.&#13;

A b s t r a c t&#13;
The paper considers the theoretical and practical problems connected with&#13;
the estimation of Gross Domestic Product for the centrally planned&#13;
economy of Czechoslovakia. In the methodological part the basic differen-&#13;
ces between the SNA and MPS accounting systems are discussed and several&#13;
transformation procedures are presented. The price formation used in&#13;
Czechoslovak MPS aggregates is briefly described before the problem of&#13;
converting-the data in national currency to US dollars is highlighted.&#13;
Alternative GDP estimates, exchange rates and growth rates are compared.&#13;
Own estimates, based on the purchasing parity type comparison with&#13;
Austria, are presented in comparison with official Czechoslovak indexes.&#13;
The appendices contain the detailed description of MPS/SNA transformation&#13;
procedures as well as the statistical tables illustrating the process of&#13;
GDP reconstruction based on Czechoslovak data for the period 1970-1980.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
S u m m a r y&#13;
The paper analyses the problem of obtaining estimates of the Gross&#13;
Domestic Product for the centrally planned economy of Czechoslovakia&#13;
which would be comparable with Western statistics. The Czechoslovak&#13;
authorities publish only a part of the system of balances of the national&#13;
economy, drawn up according to the MPS (Material Product System) methodo-&#13;
logy. The system differs from the SNA (System of National Accounts)&#13;
concept mainly in that it excludes the so called non-productive services&#13;
which - according to the MPS system - do not contribute to the generation&#13;
of new value and are treated basically as redistribution. In order to&#13;
obtain the SNA indicator of GDP, a rather straightforward method was&#13;
selected: the standard form of MPS Global Financial Balance is presented&#13;
in a more detailed form and items differentlv treated within the SNA are&#13;
regrouped appropriately. Although theoretically relatively simple, the&#13;
reconstruction of SNA indicators still poses a difficult problem as only&#13;
a part of the Global Financial Balance is generally published. Because of&#13;
the lacking data and the use of estimates, the deviations of the GDP in&#13;
current national currency units obtained by this method oscillate very&#13;
probably within a range of about + 3-4 % (of the actual GDP if all&#13;
required statistical information would be available).&#13;
The transformation procedure adopted, based as far as possible on the&#13;
official statistical data, does not leave much room for adjustments&#13;
allowing for the distorted relative prices (mainly subsidized personal&#13;
transport and housing, heavily taxed industrial consumer goods, etc.). A&#13;
brief description of the Czechoslovak price patterns (producer, consumer&#13;
and foreign trade prices) sheds some light on the impact of pricing on&#13;
the structure of GDP aggregates.&#13;
A separate problem is the selection of a realistic exchange rate to be&#13;
used for the conversion of GDP expressed in national currency to US&#13;
dollars. Six different conversion coefficients are discussed and the&#13;
scant economic meaning of the official exchange rate is illustrated. Even&#13;
if no ultimate solution for the realistic exchange rate is presented, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
alternative, purchasing power parity type conversion coefficients are&#13;
clearly more appropriate. The decisive impact of selecting the correct&#13;
conversion coefficient on obtaining the comparable GDP estimate in US&#13;
dollars is stressed: the relative differences of various GDP estimates in&#13;
national currency are negligible in comparison with the range of possible&#13;
GDP estimates in US dollars. Future research should therefore be focused&#13;
either on more plausible ways of assessing the real purchasing power of&#13;
currencies used in centrally planned economies or on to some other method&#13;
of obtaining comparable GDP estimates requiring no exchange rate conver-&#13;
sions. A volume of GDP per capita of about US $ 4500 in 1980 is the&#13;
authors' assessment.&#13;
The last part of the paper evaluates the real growth of the Czechoslovak&#13;
economy in 1970-1980. The upward bias in aggregates given at official&#13;
constant prices in the centrally planned economies is present also in the&#13;
case of Czechoslovakia. The estimated index of realistic price increases&#13;
in the field of consumption is derived from the comparison of relative&#13;
changes in purchasing power parities between the Czechoslovak and Austrian&#13;
currencies. Application of this index to the whole GDP gives an approxi-&#13;
mate lower boundary to the probable overall real price movements: the&#13;
estimated inflation in Czechoslovakia was about two times as high as the&#13;
officially reported one.&#13;
The paper contains two appendices: the first one describes in detail the&#13;
MPS/SNA GDP transformation algorithms, the second presents 21 statistical&#13;
tables illustrating all estimations using the Czechoslovak data for the&#13;
period 1970-1980.&#13;

I. DERIVATION OF GDP AND COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE&#13;
ESTIMATES (IN NATIONAL CURRENCY)&#13;
Inventory of the Main National Income Aggregates Published by the Federal&#13;
Statistical Office of Czechoslovakia&#13;
The Federal Statistical Office of Czechoslovakia (FSO) publishes only&#13;
a part of its system of balances of the national economy, drawn up according&#13;
to the MPS methodology. In essence, only the aggregates Gross Material Output&#13;
(GMO) and Net Material Product (NMP) are regularly published in the Statis-&#13;
tical Yearbooks. The most important balance, the so-called "Global Financial&#13;
Balance", or more precisely the "Balance of the Production, Distribution,&#13;
Redistribution and Use of the GMO and NMP" is considered classified informa-&#13;
tion and is not published. The incomes generated in the productive sphere are&#13;
linked, in the redistribution part of this balance, via the budget (comprising&#13;
both the state and national committees budgets), with the non-productive&#13;
sphere (excluded according to the MPS methodology from the national&#13;
accounts). The balance equates the final incomes of the population and of the&#13;
enterprises of the productive sphere and of the enterprises and institutions&#13;
of the non-productive sphere (including depreciation) with the means of pro-&#13;
duction and consumption goods generated at home and imported and destined for&#13;
consumption, gross capital formation and exports. No doubt the publication of&#13;
the Global Financial Balance would greatly facilitate the transformation of&#13;
the aggregates according to the MPS methodology into the national accounts&#13;
based on the SNA concept.&#13;
In recent years the FSO has published more statistical information on&#13;
the non-productive sphere, e.g. the "Balance of Money Incomes and Expenditure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
of the Population", and, in a very aggregated form, the "Incomes and Outlays&#13;
of the Non-Productive Sphere", but this information cannot make up the gap&#13;
created by withholding the Global Financial Balance data.&#13;
Method Used for Transformation of MPS to SNA Concept&#13;
There is no information whether the Federal Statistical Office has&#13;
made computations of the Czechoslovak national accounts according to the SNA&#13;
concept for internal purposes. The Research Computing Centre of the UN&#13;
(Vyskumne vypoctov6 stredisko OSN) in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia has made such&#13;
a computation for 1970/1 using rules and procedures recommended by the&#13;
Conference of European Statisticans of the UN/ECE, Geneva./2&#13;
The present country study is using Bratislava (1972) as a point of&#13;
departure for our own computations. The main advantages of using such an&#13;
approach are: a) the conversion matrices (presented in Appendix A) can be&#13;
used for transformation to GDP based on primary incomes, final use and by&#13;
origin of social product; furthermore the GDP aggregate may be disaggregated&#13;
into major components, b) a time series 1970-1980 can be computed,/3 c) the&#13;
actual results of Bratislava (1972) for 1970 can be utilized (with some&#13;
additional modifications) and some of the data not presented in the published&#13;
official statistical materials can be estimated for later years on the basis&#13;
of the computation results of the Czechoslovak investigators (who had access&#13;

Balance).&#13;
A disadvantage of the procedure selected may be that there is not&#13;
much room to depart from the pricing procedures actually used in Czechoslova-&#13;
kia (e.g. subsidized personal transport and housing). This may have an impact&#13;
on the structure of the GDP, but as the main aim of the World Rank project is&#13;
to obtain figures on the volume of the GDP aggregate only, this disadvantage&#13;
does not seem to be decisive. A short discussion on this subject and its&#13;
implication on a possible understatement of the GPD will be given in the part&#13;
discussing pricing problems.&#13;
Adjustments Necessary for Transformation&#13;
The adoption of the procedure developed in Bratislava, 1972 (and&#13;
based on Conf. Eur. Statis, 1965) requires presentation of the MPS data in a&#13;
form allowing for regrouping individual items treated differently in the&#13;
indicators adopted in SNA. For this purpose the standard form of MPS Global&#13;
Financial Balance must be presented in a more detailed way and items with&#13;
different treatment within the SNA concept must be regrouped appropriately.&#13;
The resulting Transformation Matrix I (see Appendix A) may be used as a&#13;
vantage point for the construction of SNA indicators. Presentation of this&#13;
matrix, based in principle on Bratislava (1972) is somewhat different from&#13;
that presented in Conf. Eur. Stats. mainly because the chief purpose is the&#13;
transformation from MPS to SNA only and MPS standards are taken as a base for&#13;
the necessary adjustments.&#13;
In the Transformation Matrix I all items subject to different&#13;
treatment in MPS and SNA are indicated. As the number of differences is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
rather numerous, only the most important ones (especially from the&#13;
quantitative point of view) are taken into account.&#13;
Derivation of GDP from Transformation Matrices&#13;
Although the number of non-zero elements in the Transformation Matrix&#13;
I is relatively low, the reconstruction of a matrix with real data still poses&#13;
a serious problem. The main source of data - Global Financial Balance - is&#13;
not generally available as it is not published in complete form in accessible&#13;
statistical materials. However, if our aim is to construct global indicators&#13;
only (i.e. GDP), the number of data needed for transformation can be even more&#13;
reduced. Yet in some cases estimation of missing items is necessary as well.&#13;
GDP Based on MPS Data on Primary Incomes&#13;
GDP may be calculated from MPS data by several alternative methods.&#13;
The first possibility is to start with Net Material Product and primary&#13;
incomes generated within the non-material sphere. In this case the NMP must&#13;
be adjusted mainly for wages and salaries and private incomes in the non-&#13;
material sphere, travel expenses, depreciation, etc. The adjustment&#13;
procedure, using the elements indicated in Transformation Matrix II, is&#13;
described in Appendix A.&#13;
GDP Based on MPS Data on Final Use&#13;
GDP may also be derived from MPS data on final use of NMP. MPS' Net&#13;
Material Product (National Income) must be adjusted for incomes and costs&#13;
within the non-material sphere, for balance of exports and imports and some&#13;
other minor transfers. The adjustment procedure uses the elements of&#13;
Transformation Matrix III (see Appendix A).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
GDP Based on NMP (MPS) by Origin&#13;
Finally, MPS data on the origin of Global Output and Net Material&#13;
Product may be used as a starting point for the derivation of GDP. This time,&#13;
NMP must be adjusted mainly for net output of non-material services (net of&#13;
material consumption and depreciation), costs of dwelling services, cost of&#13;
business travels, depreciation in the productive sphere, etc. (Appendix A).&#13;
Differences Between CMEA and Czechoslovak MPS Methodologies&#13;
The transformation procedures presented in this study are based on&#13;
MPS/SNA links (Conf. Eur. Stats. 1965) using standard CMEA concepts./4 Unfor-&#13;
tunately, each CMEA country uses a slightly different variation of its MPS&#13;
standard. Most of these variations are of a minor character (e.g. shifts&#13;
between industries, etc.), having no impact on the transformation of global&#13;
indicators, some of them however need to be taken into account. In the case&#13;
of Czechoslovakia, differences of this kind are mainly the following:&#13;
(a) The Czechoslovak methodology does not include in the productive&#13;
(material) sphere personal transport and the non-material part of communica-&#13;
tion services. While total production of communication services may be rela-&#13;
tively easily estimated, it is not so with the value of production of personal&#13;
transport. The CSSR study (Bratislava, 1972) approximates both values by&#13;
incomes of the non-material sphere from non-material services.&#13;
(b) Analogous with (a), productive (intermediate) consumption should be&#13;
adjusted.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
(c) Net Material Product should be adjusted for "net output" of personal&#13;
transport and non-material communications.&#13;
(d) Adjustments in (b) should reduce the consumption of institutions&#13;
providing services.&#13;
(e) Gross output of personal transport should be included in personal&#13;
consumption.&#13;
(f) Output of non-material communications should be split into three&#13;
parts and added to:&#13;
-    private consumption&#13;
-    consumption of institutions providing services&#13;
-    collective consumption of standard MPS (CMEA) aggregates.&#13;
Derivation of Czechoslovak GDP Based on Available Data&#13;
Even if we limit ourselves to the transformation of global indicators&#13;
only, the search for necessary data still poses a serious problem. The task&#13;
given according to the agreed outline of the country studies is, however, far&#13;
more ambitious. In addition to the global indicator of GDP derived from NMP,,&#13;
also the structural components within this aggregate:&#13;
(a) by sectors of origin,&#13;
(b) by primary incomes (by distributive shares),&#13;
(c) by final use,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
are to be computed. This multiplies the difficulties to obtain, from offi-&#13;
cially published Czechoslovak statistical materials, the necessary data./5 In&#13;
many cases estimates had to be used--as can be seen from detailed notes to the&#13;
individual transformation tables--either because a certain statistical&#13;
information was available only for a limited number of years and for the other&#13;
years of the time series own extrapolations and estimations had to be made, or&#13;
the necessary data were missing altogether and certain proxies had to be used,&#13;
taking the benchmark data used by the Czechoslovak researchers (Bratislava,&#13;
1972) for 1970 as far as possible as a point of departure. Because of the&#13;
lacking data and the use of estimates, the deviations in our estimates of the&#13;
GDP in current prices very likely oscillate within a range of plus/minus 3 to&#13;
4% (of the actual GDP) if computed with precise statistical information.&#13;
Adjustment of Czechoslovak NMP to the CMEA Methodology&#13;
One of the aims of the World Bank Project is to make the National&#13;
Accounts aggregates of the CPEs mutually comparable. For that reason national&#13;
peculiarities have to be eliminated and the original data presented in the&#13;
standard MPS (CMEA) form. In the case of Czechoslovakia this means primarily&#13;
to include personal transport and non-material communications into the NMP&#13;
aggregate.&#13;
Net output of non-material communications is easily obtained from&#13;
statistical yearbooks. It is equal to the published value of net output of&#13;
material communications which itself in Czechoslovak statistical practice is&#13;
estimated as 50% of net output of total communications (both material and non-&#13;
5/ The Czechoslovak authorities did not respond to the World Bank request to&#13;
cooperate in the effort of deriving GDP/GNP data according to the SNA&#13;
concept.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
material)./6 A more complicated procedure is necessary to estimate the net&#13;
output of personal transport. In Czechoslovakia output of material transport&#13;
is computed on the basis of data on incomes of transport enterprises (from&#13;
transportation of material goods, see SNTL/ALFA, 1969). We used a similar&#13;
approach for estimating the net output of personal transport. From published&#13;
data on the performance of different types of personal transport the total&#13;
value of net output in personal transport was estimated and inserted in Table&#13;
1 (Appendix B). As the costs of personal transport are greater than incomes&#13;
(personal transport in Czechoslovakia is heavily subsidized) the resulting&#13;
aggregate - Net Material Product according to the standard MPS methodology -&#13;
is lower than that published in Czechoslovak statistics./7 The relative&#13;
difference between the two versions of Net Material Product is almost constant&#13;
during the whole period.&#13;

The more detailed results of the adjustment of the Czechoslovak version of NMP&#13;
to the standard CMEA MPS concept are presented in Table 1 (Appendix B).&#13;
Derivation of GDP from Data on NMP According to Primary Incomes&#13;
The division of the NMP according to primary incomes (which is a&#13;
point of departure for the transformation) distinguishes the so-called fund of&#13;
individual distribution (primary incomes of population) and the fund of socie-&#13;
tal (collective) distribution (primary income of enterprises), both limited to&#13;
the material sphere only. In the aggregate of primary incomes of the popula-&#13;
tion not only wages and salaries generated in the material sphere, but also&#13;
the money incomes and incomes in kind of cooperative farmers from cooperative&#13;
activity and the private incomes of the population (from different heteroge-&#13;
neous activities within the material sphere) are included. The category of&#13;
private incomes according to the Czechoslovak methodology includes the net&#13;
incomes from private plots of cooperative farmers, the net incomes of private&#13;
peasants (40,000 persons in 1980), and the net incomes of a small number of&#13;
persons working as self-employed in the material sphere. On the other hand,&#13;
in the SNA methodology, the following types of primary incomes can be&#13;
distinguished: compensation of employees; operating surplus including&#13;
indirect taxes; and consumption of fixed capital.&#13;
In the transformation procedure, the incomes of cooperative farmers&#13;
from cooperative activity are treated in the same way as wages and salaries of&#13;
othe&amp;r workers in the material sphere, while, according to the SNA, private&#13;
incomes (including those from private plots of cooperative farmers) are&#13;
shifted from the primary incomes of the population to the primary income of&#13;
enterprises (operating surplus). This procedure takes into account the&#13;
ambivalent role of cooperative farmers with respect to their social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
standing. In their cooperative activity they play essentially the same role&#13;
as any other wage earner in the material sphere. They get a monthly&#13;
remuneration and participate in the enterprise results of the cooperative only&#13;
by end of the year premia. But this type of remuneration is also applied in&#13;
state-owned enterprises. From private plots, on the other hand, the&#13;
cooperative farmers receive an income from the sale of agricultural products&#13;
after deduction of the production costs.&#13;
Further in the course of transformation procedure, private incomes&#13;
originating from the non-material sphere have to be added to NMP.    This figure.&#13;
is not directly available and our estimate is based on the benchmark informa-&#13;
tion from Bratislava (1972). An alternative way of assessment (based on the&#13;
aggregate money incomes and outlays of the population data) would lead to&#13;
somewhat higher results: for 1980 about 3 bill.Kcs higher than our estimate&#13;
found on line 3 of Table 2 (App. B). On the other hand, travel expenses of&#13;
employees in the material sphere, treated in the MPS concept as a part of&#13;
primary incomes of the population, should be deducted according to the SNA&#13;
methodology as here they form part of intermediate consumption of&#13;
enterprises. There was no possibility of estimating this item from available&#13;
statistical material. It is likely that the above-mentioned possible&#13;
underestimation of private incomes originating from the non-material sphere is&#13;
compensated by omitting the deduction of the travel expenses. Further, losses&#13;
on stocks have been estimated as a difference of total losses and losses on&#13;
fixed capital stock, both available from published statistical data. All&#13;
other steps of the transformation procedure are sufficiently explained in the&#13;
notes to Table 2 in Appendex B. The GDP derived from data according to&#13;
primary incomes increases over time in relation to the NMP (CMEA version) from&#13;
about 117% in 1970 to 120% in 1980.&#13;

As to the structure of GDP by primary incomes, under labour incomes&#13;
(according to SNA diction: compensation of employees) the following items were&#13;
summarized: the primary incomes according to the NMP concept (compensations&#13;
of wage and salary earners in the material sphere and earnings of cooperative&#13;
farmers from cooperative activity) minus private incomes in the material&#13;
sphere plus compensations of wage and salary earners in the non-material&#13;
sphere plus the employers' contributions to social security in both material&#13;
and non-material spheres. The non-labour incomes (operating surplus including&#13;
net indirect taxes) are calculated as the difference between GDP and the&#13;
labour incomes plus depreciation in the material and non-material spheres.&#13;
The distribution according to labour and non-labour incomes and depreciation&#13;
remains fairly constant during the observed time period 1970-1980 (Tables 3&#13;
and 4 in Appendix B).&#13;
For comparative purposes the structure of the Net Material Product&#13;
(according to MPS) by primary incomes is also given (Tables 5 and 6). As the&#13;
NMP aggregate is net of depreciations, labour and non-labour incomes only are&#13;
distinguished. In this aggregate the proportion of non-labour incomes is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
increasing over time: a development to be expected since employment in the&#13;
non-material sphere is increasing faster than that in the material sphere and&#13;
the costs of the faster growth of the non-material sphere have to be covered&#13;
from the non-labour incomes generated in the material sphere. The faster&#13;
growth of the non-material sphere results also in the slightly greater average&#13;
annual rate of growth of GDP than NMP (4.7 vs 4.4% p.a. in 1970-1980).&#13;
Derivation of GDP from Data on NMP According to Data on Final Use&#13;
The aggregate of the NMP is composed of the final (material) consump-&#13;
tion of the population, other final (material) consumption, net fixed capital&#13;
formation and capital formation in stocks. After an adjustment for losses on&#13;
fixed capital and stocks and for the foreign trade surplus or deficit we&#13;
obtain the NMP produced as given in Table 1, Appendix B (after further adjust-&#13;
ments for personal transport and non-material communications). In the trans-&#13;
formation procedure we have firstly to add purchases of nonmaterial services&#13;
by households. This item has to be estimated as explained in notes 2-5 of&#13;
Table 7 in Appendix B, because the published statistical materials do not&#13;
distinguish household expenditures on services by the nature of services&#13;
purchased (material and non-material).&#13;
A second adjustment item, and one of the most troublesome, are the&#13;
expenditures on housing. As in the other CPE countries, so also in&#13;
Czechoslovakia, housing is heavily subsidized by the state and the rents paid&#13;
by the population do not cover the operating costs and depreciation of&#13;
housing. An additional difficulty in obtaining the necessary data on housing&#13;
arises from the fact that the only available data source (the published table&#13;
on money incomes and outlays of the population) gives no separate data on&#13;
housing but treats it together with communal services. Nor do direct data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
exist for estimating the imputed rent for owner-dwellers. By adding household&#13;
expenditures on dwelling and communal services (combined) to the NMP under No.&#13;
6 of Table 7 a certain overestimation of the household expenditures on non-&#13;
material services takes place, as only a part of the communal services has&#13;
non-material character. On the other hand, no item for the imputed rent was&#13;
taken into account./8&#13;
We assume that the over- and under-estimation cancel each other&#13;
out. Moreover, under the methodology used there is no room for increasing the&#13;
household expenditures on housing by the value of the housing subsidies. In&#13;
addition to these purely technical reasons it is also conceptually debatable&#13;
whether it is correct to increase the relative price of one expenditure item&#13;
in the national accounts (as for instance the Alton group is doing) but to&#13;
leave other relative prices (e.g. for public transport, but also for the&#13;
overpriced durables and many other manufactured goods) unchanged.&#13;
/8 There are more approaches in assessing the value of imputed rents. One&#13;
may, for instance, take the data on privately owned houses (data from the&#13;
population census - see SY 1981/93) - in 1980 there were 2441 th. of&#13;
dwellings in private houses in Czechoslovakia - and assume the same&#13;
average rent as that charged in state-owned houses: 1695 Kcs in 1980 (SY&#13;
1981/553). An assumption about identical average rents in private and&#13;
public houses would be justified if the quality of both types of houses&#13;
were approximately the same. Such an assumption may hold if one takes into&#13;
account that the lower quality of some of the private houses in rural&#13;
areas is compensated by the higher standard of private houses in towns&#13;
(owned largely by upper strata in the society). This procedure would lead&#13;
to an estimate of the value of imputed rents amounting to 4137.5 mil. Kcs&#13;
in 1980 (approx. 0.7 % of GDP). Another possibility is to take the share&#13;
of the value of private houses in the value of the total housing stock&#13;
(amounting to 31 % in 1975 - see Academia, 1979 p.83) and estimate the&#13;
imputed rents proportionally to the costs of state owned dwellings (9.614&#13;
mil. Kcs in 1980 - see SY 1981/553). This procedure leads to a somewhat&#13;
lower estimate for the value of imputed rents: 2.980 mil. Kcs in 1980&#13;
(0.5 % of GDP).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
The next item to be deducted from NMP are the material costs in&#13;
business travel expenditures. Also on this item no data exist in the&#13;
published statistical materials. We used an estimate suggested in Bratislava,&#13;
1972 (see note 7 to Table 7).&#13;
The lines 8 and 9 in Table 7 from Appendix B, comprise the material&#13;
costs of institutions from the non-material sphere which have to be deducted&#13;
as they are already included in the collective consumption of the NMP.&#13;
The other costs of services provided by budgetary institutions (to be&#13;
added after deduction of incomes from these services) had to be estimated&#13;
because the published material again lacks this information. The procedure&#13;
used was to take the total budgetary expenditures from the consolidated state&#13;
and national committee budgets, to deduct from this item the budgetary&#13;
expenditures for productive purposes, deduct the transfers from the state&#13;
budget to the budget of national committees (to avoid double counting), and&#13;
lastly, to deduct the own incomes of the budgetary institutions providing&#13;
services.&#13;
The other items are sufficiently explained in the notes. As to the&#13;
omission of the external balance arising from exports and imports of non-&#13;
material services, one can assume that the figure - especially in the later&#13;
ye rs - may have been a negative one, because of the net outflow of the&#13;
payments for licences and royalties and for servicing the external debt./9&#13;
The only figure available (for 1970) amounted to excess of imports over&#13;
exports by 780 mill.Kcs (Bratislava, 1972).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
The GDP calculated from data on final use is greater by 17 % than the&#13;
NMP in 1970 and its share is steadily increasing over time. For 1980, the&#13;
estimate of the GDP, (derived mainly from provisional data) seems to be biased&#13;
upwards. The GDP exceeds the NMP by almost 24 %; it may be that the figures&#13;
for 1980 will have to be adjusted if definite statistical information would be&#13;
available.&#13;
Tables 8 and 9 in Appendix B, give the structure of the GDP by final&#13;
use. Notes 1 and 2 to the Table 8 explain the computations leading to the&#13;
sub-aggregates of residential households' consumption expenditures and&#13;
government final consumption expenditures. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the notes&#13;
explain how we arrived at the gross capital formation and at the balance of&#13;
exports minus imports. Also in this table the balance of external transac-&#13;
tions in non-material services had to be omitted owing to the lack of data.&#13;
As to the structure of the GDP by final use, the share of final consumption&#13;
expenditures of government is increasing over time from 14 to 17%, the share&#13;
of gross capital formation is increasing in the first half of the seventies&#13;
from 34 to 36% and declining with decelerating economic development in the&#13;
second half of the 1970s, reaching 32% in 1980. The share of consumption&#13;
expenditures by residential households is fairly constant during the period&#13;
with the exception of the years 1977 and 1978. The sudden increase of this&#13;
share in these two years is connected with the reform of producer prices (see&#13;
further discussion on pricing).&#13;
For comparative purposes the structure of the NMP by final use is&#13;
given as well (Tables 10 and 11, Appendix B). The tendencies of development&#13;
are the same as described for the GDP above. It should, however, be pointed&#13;
out that according to the MPS methodology the NMP used domestically has a dif-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
ferent value and meaning in comparison with the NMP produced, as the latter&#13;
aggregate has to be adjusted for losses and for the balance of merchandise&#13;
trade. Up to 1975 and again in 1979 and 1980 the NMP used was smaller than&#13;
the NMP produced owing to these adjustments.&#13;
GDP Derived from Data on Gross Material Output and NMP by Origin&#13;
Only rough approximations are possible for the computation using this&#13;
method because the most essential statistical information - the gross output&#13;
of on-budgetary enterprises providing services - is missing (Table 12,&#13;
Appendix B). Also, the data on costs of services provided by budgetary&#13;
organizations are not directly available. In Table 12 similar procedure as in&#13;
Table 7 is used for assessing the gross output of non-material services in&#13;
both budgetary and non-budgetary institutions from the consolidated state and&#13;
national committees' budget expenditures (see Notes 2 and 3 to Table 12). The&#13;
material consumption in the non-material sphere (Note 4) has to be deducted&#13;
likewise as the payments for nonmaterial services, as they are already&#13;
included in the gross output of the non-material services. For the other&#13;
entries see the remaining notes./10&#13;
Tables 13 and 14 in Appendix B give the structure of the Gross&#13;
Product divided into intermediate consumption and GDP. The notes explain the&#13;
procedure of computation sufficiently. The structure reveals a steady growth&#13;
of the share of intermediate consumption till 1977. In the last years the&#13;
share of intermediate consumption is slightly declining. For illustration,&#13;
/10 The costs of private dwellings, which are to be deducted from the NMP&#13;
have been omitted. According to the computations made by the Czecho-&#13;
slovak researchers (Bratislava, 1972), these costs amounted to Kcs 880&#13;
mill. or less then 0.25 % of GDP in 1970.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
the analogous structure according to the MPS concept (of the Gross Material&#13;
Output) is given in Tables 15 and 16. The tendencies between shares of&#13;
productive consumption and NMP in GMO are similar as in the case of SNA&#13;
aggregates.&#13;
Comparison with Alternative GDP Estimates in National Currency&#13;
In Table 17 from Appendix B, the three different GDP estimates&#13;
(according to primary incomes, final use and activity by origin) are compared&#13;
and it is suggested to use an average of the three estimates for the&#13;

As can be seen from the above table, the Alton's estimate of GDP for&#13;
1977 in current prices is more than 36% higher than the officially reported&#13;
NMP. The two alternative estimates of Krejci are higher by 26.7 % and 27.7%&#13;
respectively. According to our estimate the GDP exceeds the volume of NMP by&#13;
17.3% only. If the Czechoslovak NMP is recalculated according to the CMEA&#13;
standard, the distance of estimated GDP from NMP becomes even wider, approach-&#13;
ing in the case of Alton's estimate almost 40%. Taking into account that the&#13;
non-material services in Czechoslovakia--perhaps with the exception of health&#13;
and education--are notoriously underdeveloped, the share of the non-material&#13;
services according to Alton and perhaps even according to Krejci seems to be&#13;
high when compared with Western industrialized countries. If we compare the&#13;
ratios of GDP to NMP for Czechoslovakia with that given for Hungary in&#13;
1976,/11 we obtain an index of 119.2 which is practically identical with our&#13;
result. It may be interesting to note that the GDP of Austria (1974) is 28 %&#13;
higher than a computed NMP aggregate (Studies in Methods, Series F. No. 20,&#13;
Part II, 1981). R. Wintrova even claims that the value of Czechoslovak GDP&#13;
according to the SNA concept would be only 11% larger than the NMP (Academia,&#13;
1979).&#13;
The GDP aggregates of Krejci are probably higher because some double-&#13;
counting is likely within the assessment of capital formation. The probable&#13;
upper bias of the Alton GDP estimate is due mainly to his imputations of value&#13;

of dwellings and returns to land. On the other hand, his aggregate at so-&#13;
called adjusted factor costs does not take into account the turnover tax&#13;
(amounting to 71 bill. of Kcs in 1977 - see SY 1981/159) and the amount of&#13;
subsidies. Thojugh no accurate estimate of the value of subsidies is&#13;
available, there seems to be no doubt that the yield of the turnover tax is&#13;
higher than the amount of subsidies. It follows that the GDP aggregate at&#13;
factor costs (Alton) ought to be lower than the one at market prices (our&#13;
estimate).&#13;

II. PRICE FORMATION USED IN CZECHOSLOVAK MPS AGGREGATES&#13;
The prices in the Czechoslovak national accounts are a mixture of&#13;
market prices and producer prices. The two systems of prices developed rela-&#13;
tively independently of each other not only with regard to the change in price&#13;
levels, but also to the relative changes of prices within each system.&#13;
Producer Prices&#13;
The producer prices are formed by the costs of production and a&#13;
certain amount of profit. Up to 1967 the producer prices were determined on a&#13;
cost-plus basis (taking as a basis for the rate of profit total unit costs&#13;
calculated on the branch or product-group level). In 1967 a price reform of&#13;
producer prices was carried out, introducing the so-called two-channel type of&#13;
prices. Profit was calculated separately in fixed proportions to wages and to&#13;
the value of fixed capital and stocks. In 1977, a new reform of producer&#13;
prices was adopted and the basically applied production price model included a&#13;
profit rate which was charged proportionally to the value of fixed capital and&#13;
stocks. In both cases, that means in the 1967 and 1977 price reforms, the&#13;
overall producer price level was also affected. In 1967 the rate of profit&#13;
was considerably increased while in 1977 the rate of profit was lowered, but&#13;
the overall level of producer prices was lowered to a lesser degree. These&#13;
across-the-board price reforms interrupted the "normal" development of current&#13;
prlces. e.g., a comparison of the NMP and GDP estimates for 1977 with those&#13;
for 1976, both at current prices (see Table 17, Appendix B) should not be&#13;
Interpreted to mean that the level of economic activity in 1977 was lower than&#13;
the year before. When comparing the NMP data for 1976 at current prices with&#13;

the same data valued at 1977 official constant prices, a price difference of&#13;
minus 4.2% appears which is due precisely to the new valuation of producers'&#13;
prices (see SY 1981/142). Some insight into the structure of producer prices&#13;
may provide the table for Khozraschot (state and cooperative) organizations.12&#13;
Retail Trade (Consumer) Prices&#13;
The retail trade prices, applied to consumption goods in the national&#13;
balances, are not tied to production costs but are determined by a mix of&#13;
social preferences and by the demand and supply situation on the market. The&#13;
difference between the producer price (charged by enterprises) and the retail&#13;
price (paid by the population for consumer goods) is made up of the trade&#13;
mark-up and the turnover tax, the rate of which varies greatly, not only by&#13;
commodity groups but also within each commodity group. In some cases (as in&#13;
public transport and housing, but also with some cultural goods and services)&#13;
price subsidies make up the difference between the price charged to the&#13;
private consumers and the higher producer price.&#13;
It must be noted that the turnover tax is levied on population&#13;
purchases of consumption goods only, while intermediate products, investment&#13;
goods and changes in stock as well as purchases of consumer goods by "social-&#13;
ist" organizations are priced mainly at producer prices. Producer prices are&#13;
those charged by production enterprises in industry, procurement prices of&#13;
agricultural products, prices of construction works, transport rates a.s.o.&#13;
All these prices have in common that, unlike with consumer goods, no turnover&#13;
/12 Khozraschot (non-budgetary) organizations have their own financial&#13;
accounting and are linked to the state budget by profits or losses only.&#13;
&#13;

tax is levied on them. This applies also to foreign trade prices (actual&#13;
transaction prices converted into national currency from rouble and dollar&#13;
values at internal conversion rates); here, however, the prices are formed on&#13;
the external market, outside the control of the planning authorities.&#13;
In the national accounts the turnover tax is always accounted for by&#13;
the branch in which the taxed commodities are produced, notwithstanding the&#13;
fact that the turnover tax is levied on the retail level and paid by the&#13;
consumer in the act of purchase from a trade organization. As in fact the&#13;
bulk of consumer goods is produced by industry - perhaps with the exception of&#13;
fresh fruits and vegetables - the turnover tax is apportioned in the national&#13;
accounts, overwhelmingly to industry, giving to this branch a higher propor-&#13;
tion when priced at final realization prices (including turnover tax) than if&#13;
the aggregates would be priced at producer prices. The following table shows&#13;
the branch structure of the NMP in 1967 at various valuations (see Academia,&#13;
1979, p.106). However, in the course of attempted economic reforms, the&#13;
amount of turnover tax was lowered and the difference between producer and&#13;
market prices diminished somewhat.&#13;
Thus, for instance, the turnover tax yielded to 50.1 bill. Kcs in&#13;
1970 and 85.5 bill. Kcs in 1980 while subsidies (granted to Khozraschot&#13;
organizations only) amounted to 29.2 bill. Kcs in 1980 (data on subsidies for&#13;
1970 not available) - see SY 1981/159, 162. However, this leaves out the&#13;
amount of subsidies in budgetary organizations (e.g. in personal transport)&#13;
where subsidies are higher. No comparable data exist for the amount of&#13;
turnover tax and subsidies by branches. The turnover tax amounted presumably&#13;
to 80% of the difference between producer and market prices in industry until&#13;
the price reform of 1967. After an increase of the profit rate in 1967 the&#13;
share of the turnover tax dropped to 44% only (see Academia, 1979, p. 104).&#13;

Globally, the yield from the turnover tax exceeded the amount of subsidies&#13;
granted to Khozraschot organizations by 61.5 bill. Kcs in 1980 or by about 5 %&#13;
of output of these organizations expressed at producer prices (see SY&#13;
1981/162-164; the data for budgetary organizations are not available). In&#13;
assessing the difference between the level of producer and market (retail)&#13;
prices one may compare the data on personal consumption taken from national&#13;
accounts statistics (at market prices) with those from input-output tables (at&#13;
producer prices). In 1977, the personal consumption at market prices amounted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
to 229.7 bill. Kcs (SY 1980/132) but valued at producer prices it amounted to&#13;
182.6 bill. Kcs. only (SY 1980/131). The level of retail prices thus exceeded&#13;
that of producer prices by 25.8% (in 1973 it was by 23.1% - see SY 1976/151-&#13;
152; the input-output tables are available for 1973 and 1977 only) made up by&#13;
the mark up of the trade organizations and the turnover tax.&#13;
The "final realization prices" of the national accounts are formed by&#13;
a mix of:&#13;
(a) market prices (retail prices for consumer goods, with the exception&#13;
of public consumption and consumption in kind),&#13;
(b) producer prices (for capital formation and changes of stocks),&#13;
(c) foreign trade prices.&#13;
From the structure of NMP follows that its greater part is expressed in market&#13;
prices (see Table 9, Appendix B).&#13;
Foreign Trade Prices&#13;
The Statistical Yearbook is very vague about the prices used for the&#13;
export and import figures in the national accounts. It only explains that&#13;
"foreign trade prices used in the actual settlements" are used, but it is&#13;
nowhere indicated that the data in the foreign trade part of the Statistical&#13;
Yearbooks are expressed in different foreign trade prices (at official&#13;
exchange rates of either Western currencies or transferable rouble). On the&#13;
other hand, the foreign trade data used in the National Income part of the&#13;
Statistical Yearbooks are expressed in domestic currency by using the official&#13;
exchange rate adjusted by the special internal conversion coefficients which&#13;
are not published and are considered to be classified information. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
foreign trade statistics published in different parts of the yearbook are thus&#13;
not comparable./13&#13;
There is also no explanation that the concept of imports and exports&#13;
used in the national account statistics differs from the concept used in the&#13;
foreign trade statistics. The national accounts use an enlarged concept which&#13;
includes, in addition to merchandise trade, also the value of freight trans-&#13;
port, communications and middlemen trade. It is a somewhat crude concept of&#13;
the current account but as the MPS concept excludes the non-productive sphere,&#13;
the export and import figures do not include incomes and outlays vis-a-vis the&#13;
outside world derived from interest, royalties, transfer payments and tourist&#13;
trade (i.e. the trade in the non-material services).&#13;
As to the character of the foreign trade prices converted to the&#13;
national currency at internal conversion coefficients, one can roughly compare&#13;
them with the average level of producer prices. The coefficients have been&#13;
fixed originally at the level of the so-called re-production costs expressing&#13;
the number of units of national currency necessary to earn one dollar or one&#13;
rouble respectively in exports. The procedure was to value the bundle of&#13;
commodities exported to the West in dollars and those exported to the CMEA in&#13;
transferable roubles and to compare the sum with approximately the same basket&#13;
valued in domestic producer prices. This system can be compared with the&#13;
multiple exchange rate system, where subsidies are granted for some commodi-&#13;
ties (if the price achieved in foreign trade would be too low) to guarantee to&#13;
the production enterprise the producer price valid in the domestic economy&#13;
/13 Moreover, since 1975 foreign trade transactions at domestic prices are&#13;
not entered any more separately for imports and exports, but only the net&#13;
balance is given.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
while a system of additional charges payable to the government is introduced&#13;
for the other commodities (where the use of the conversion coefficient could&#13;
lead to windfall gains). But, on average, all production enterprises were&#13;
supposed to achieve from exports (converted at the internal conversion&#13;
coefficient into domestic currency) the "average" producer price.&#13;
The different valuation of the national accounts aggregates at a mix&#13;
of producer prices, retail prices and foreign trade prices affects naturally&#13;
not only the structure of the NMP but its rate of growth as well (see&#13;
Academia, 1979, p. 107).&#13;

III. CONVERSION FROM KCS TO US DOLLARS&#13;
Six different conversion coefficients can be used:&#13;
(1) the official exchange rate;&#13;
(2) a purchasing power parity computation elaborated by the Statistical&#13;
Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (Wiesbaden);&#13;
(3) our purchasing power parity estimate (computed by P. Havlik);&#13;
(4) the tourist exchange rate applied officially to Western visitors of&#13;
Czechoslovakia;&#13;
(5) a conversion factor derived from comparing imports and exports in&#13;
domestic currency and foreign trade Kcs (J. Krejci, 1982).&#13;
(6) the so-called realistic exchange rate between US$, rouble and Kcs/14&#13;
In the case of the first PPP (Wiesbaden), the second PPP (Havlik) as&#13;
well as in the case of tourist exchange rate the exchange relations expressed&#13;
in DM and AS were converted to US $ using the official exchange rates between&#13;
US dollar and DM or AS (see Table 19). The results expressed as the quanti-&#13;
ties of Kcs per 1 US$ are given in Table 19 from Appendix B. The different&#13;
conversion factors vary between 4.273 Kcs per 1 US $ to 21.067 Kcs per 1 US$&#13;
in 1980.&#13;
The official exchange rate has no real economic meaning but it is&#13;
used in the official Czechoslovak foreign trade statistics. Formally, it is&#13;
based on the collection of laws on the monetary reform Nr. 41/1953. Till the&#13;
early seventies the official exchange rate was kept unchanged, but later on it&#13;
was frequently adjusted, taking into account the devaluation of the US&#13;

Bulletin, Vol. XXIV, No. 1, Spring 1982.&#13;

dollar.  Since all foreign commercial transaction with the West are settled in&#13;
foreign currencies and the values expressed in foreign currencies are&#13;
converted to foreign exchange Kcs using the official exchange rates, one can&#13;
vice versa reconvert the export (import) values expressed in foreign exchange&#13;
Kcs into US $ by using the official exchange rate. Thus the official exchange&#13;
rate can be safely used to get dollar-values of imports and exports to non-&#13;
socialist countries officially reported in the Czechoslovak statistical&#13;
yearbooks in their Foreign Trade Part.   The implicit unit prices derived by&#13;
using this exchange rate have, however, no connection with actual domestic&#13;
prices applied in the whole economy. To link the domestic price level more&#13;
J&amp;f!alistically to prices achieved on the foreign markets or to prices charged&#13;
t by foreign suppliers the internal conversion coefficients reflecting the value&#13;
of US dollar and transferable rouble were introduced at the end of the sixties&#13;
(see the Government degree number 189/1966). The internal coefficients were&#13;
fixed at 27.0 Kcs per 1 US $ and to 18 Kcs per 1 TR-Rouble. The relation in TR//:(-47&#13;
respect to the US dollar was almost 4 times higher than the official exchange&#13;
rate (Kcs 7.20 per 1 US $). The same coefficient was two and a quarter times&#13;
higher than the official exchange rate of Kcs and the Soviet Rouble (8.00 Kcs&#13;
per 1 Soviet Rouble). Since the time of its first introduction the internal&#13;
conversion coefficients were no longer officially reported and they are today&#13;
considered classified information. However, it is known that they remained&#13;
unchanged till the end of 1976 and new internal conversion coefficients were&#13;
established from the beginning of 1977. Apparently these coefficients too&#13;
were kept stable till 1980, not taking into account the violent fluctuations&#13;
of exchange rates between the currencies of the market economies. For the&#13;

The exchange rate listed in Table 19 at line 9 (Appendix B) is in&#13;
essence the average of the internal conversion coefficients with respect to&#13;
the US$ and the transferable Rouble. Used as weights are the different shares&#13;
of the trade (with the rouble-area and the non-rouble area) and the exchange&#13;
rate is computed as the weighted average:&#13;

The exchange rates applicable for foreign trade (lines 9 and 10 in&#13;
Table 19) undervaluate, in our opinion, the real exchange relations in com-&#13;
parison with realistic exchange rates, as only the commodities traded in&#13;
international trade are here taken into account and not all goods and services&#13;
produced and domestically used. The point has been argued at length by&#13;
Marer./16 According to our judgement a realistic exchange-rate should lie&#13;
somewhere between our calculated purchasing power parity (line 7) and the&#13;

tourist exchange rate (line 8). The GDP per capita figures in US$ converted&#13;
with the alternative exchange rates are given in Table 20, Appendix B. The&#13;
use of various exchange rates also affects the nominal growth rate of the GDP&#13;
in current prices as well as the real growth rate of GDP in constant Kcs (see&#13;
Table 21, Appendix B).&#13;
A volume of GDP per capita of about 4,500 US$ (resp. 3,500 US$ if an&#13;
adjustment for Czechoslovak inflation is considered) in 1980 seems to be a&#13;
realistic assessment.&#13;
After completing the study and assessing its results one finding of&#13;
great importance for future possible research must be stressed: while the&#13;
various GDP estimates at national currency oscillate within a range 487-566&#13;
bil. Kcs in 1977, the GDP per capita estimates in U.S. dollars fluctuate from&#13;
1580 to 5737 U.S. dollars in the same year. The relative difference in GDP&#13;
estimates at national currency is thus 16.2% while the relative difference of&#13;
GDP estimates expressed in U.S. dollars amounts to 263.1%! This large&#13;
fluctuation of dollar estimates is due to the great variations in possible&#13;
exchange rates.&#13;
It seems to us that future research should be focused either on more&#13;
plausible ways of assessing the real purchasing power of CPEs national&#13;
currencies or into some other method requiring no exchange rate conversions in&#13;
an estimation procedure (i.e. PIG, etc) since the use pf a particular exchange&#13;
rate has a decisive effect on the estimate of the dollar value of the GDP.&#13;

IV. ASSESSMENT OF THE REAL GROWTH OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK ECONOMY&#13;
IN 1970-1980&#13;
The Czechoslovak statistical office measures the growth of the NMP by&#13;
using constant prices fixed to certain base years. In the time period observed&#13;
constant prices fixed to the year 1967 were used till 1976, and from 1977 up&#13;
to 1980 prices of 1977 are being applied. The two price levels are supposedly&#13;
linked by chaining of the respective price indixes (see SY 1981/134). The&#13;
Czechoslovak economists and statisticians are themselves aware of the fact&#13;
that the price indices deflate the indicators only to a limited extent./17&#13;
Just to illustrate this feature the following table presents selected value,&#13;
volume and price indexes taken directly or calculated from data in different&#13;
parts of the Czechoslovak Statistical Yearbook 1981. The paradoxical result--&#13;
namely the growth rate of NMP at official constant prices is faster than the&#13;
growth rate computed from data at current prices, in spite of the fact that&#13;
some inflation is officially admitted-was achieved mainly by a simple statis-&#13;
tical procedure: together with the change of price levels in 1976 a branch&#13;
classification reform was performed. The effects of actual price changes thus&#13;
cannot be traced at all from official statistical sources.&#13;
The reasons for the upward bias in aggregates given at official&#13;
constant prices in the centrally planned economies are well known and a more&#13;
detailed discussion is not possible within the frame of this study. According&#13;
to Academia (1979) the probability of an upward bias not reflected in the&#13;
offical price indices is greater for the non-standard production, especially&#13;

in case of construction and investment goods. But the probability of price&#13;
increases not sufficiently reflected in the price index is high also with&#13;
consumer prices, even if to a lesser extent. From such an assessment it can&#13;
be deduced that the construction of an index of realistic price increases in&#13;
the field of consumption and application of this index to all the sub-&#13;
aggregates of the GDP would give us a lower boundary of the probable overall&#13;
real price development. One approach to assess the actual price development&#13;
(at least for consumption) is to compare the purchasing power parity between&#13;
Czechoslovakia and some Western market economy (Austria) at two different&#13;
points of time under the assumption that, in the Western country, the price&#13;
development is correctly reflected in the official consumer price index. This&#13;
procedure was used in order to estimate the actual Czechoslovak development of&#13;
consumer prices for the period from 1970 to 1980./18 For 1964 the purchasing&#13;
power parity is based on the results of a Czechoslovak study. As can be seen&#13;
from the table, the PPP of 1 AS equals 0.5232 Kcs in 1980 while in 1964 it&#13;
amounted to 0.70 Kcs./19&#13;
The individual price indexes for 1980 were calculated on the basis of&#13;
roughly 130 items at prices taken from official statistics of both countries;&#13;
in the case of CSSR some quality adjustments were taken into account (analo-&#13;

Austria in 1980 is the topic of a separate study of one of the co-authors&#13;

gous to those made in the original Czechoslovak study/19 estimating the PPP&#13;
for 1964).&#13;
The resulting PPP in 1980 is thus comparable with PPP calculated for&#13;
1964 (1 AS = 0.70 Kcs). Both PPP's were used for estimating the actual growth&#13;
of consumer prices in CSSR (officially reported consumer price index 80/64 was&#13;
124.7% - see SY 1981/257, 1972/486). Knowing the Austrian inflation in the&#13;
period (227.14%) we estimate actual inflation (consumer price index in CSSR)&#13;
through the relative change of PPPs:&#13;
I   = I .     1980 = 2.2714 0-52 = 1.69&#13;
cs    appp                 0.70&#13;
The estimated consumer price index 1980/1964 for CSSR is thus 169% (about 3.3%&#13;
per year) instead of the officially reported 124.7% (1.4% per year).&#13;
Assuming the constant degree of bias in the official reporting of&#13;
Czechoslovak price indexes (during the whole period 1964-1980) we assigned&#13;
47.9% of the total estimated price increment to the period 1970-1980 (offi-&#13;
cially reported price increment in 1970-1980 is 11.85%, i.e. 47.9% of the&#13;
total reported price increment in period 1964-1980 - see SY 1972/486,&#13;
1981/257).&#13;
For the period .1980/1970 we obtain the estimated consumer price&#13;
index: 1.33 (47.9% of the total estimated price increment in 1964-1980).&#13;
Since the value index of our average estimate of GDP 1980/1970 is 1.58 (Table&#13;
17) we get, for the estimated real growth of GDP: 1.58/1.33 = 1.19 for the&#13;

in notes to Table 18 from Appendix B.&#13;
The line 4 in Table 18 gives the volume of GDP in national currency&#13;
at estimated real "constant prices". The real growth of GDP in the period&#13;
1970-1980 was estimated by 19% with an average yearly growth rate of 1.7%. A&#13;
second possibility is to measure the real growth rate based on data on final&#13;
use (lines 5 to 8 in Table 18, Appendix B) giving a slightly lower growth rate&#13;
(1.2% p.a.).&#13;

When comparing the different available alternative growth rates of Czechos-&#13;
lovak GDP (Alton's vs. our estimates) it can be seen that the difference is&#13;
negligible in the first half of the period (1970-75) while in the second half&#13;
/21 Obtained as: official volume index of NMP (1.58) divided by our estimate&#13;
of GDP real growth (1.19) gives the total bias of the real growth 1,33&#13;
for 1970-80. The average annual bias is thus 1.029.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
(1975-80) Alton's growth rates are considerably higher. Thus according to our&#13;
estimate average annual real growth in the second half of the decade amounted&#13;
to 1.0 %, Alton's to 2.0 % for GNP (GDP).&#13;
The differences follow first of all from the various estimation&#13;
procedures used. While our estimates are in essence deflated official "real"&#13;
rates of NMP growth (and therefore do not take into account the slightly&#13;
higher growth rates of the non-material sphere), Alton's estimates are based&#13;
on estimates of growth rates of the various production and service branches&#13;
(aggregating the sectoral indexes into an index of GNP with weights reflecting&#13;
the estimated sectoral contributions in terms of 1977 weights).&#13;
The higher growth rates of Alton thus may result mainly from:&#13;
- higher growth rates of non-material sectors,&#13;
- own estimates of rent and imputed rent from private dwellings,&#13;
- neglecting the increasing losses of personal transport,&#13;
-  use of a different price level.&#13;
It is also possible that our assumption about the constant rate of bias in&#13;
official statistical reporting does not hold and the quality of official price&#13;
indexes improved after 1977. However, the exact source of differences in&#13;
alternative growth rates is very difficult to trace.&#13;

noticed that some transformation items (n9,22; n9,24; n17,22; n17,24) are&#13;
ommitted in Transformation Matrix II as they vanish during the conversion. In&#13;
practice, as the detailed itemizing of data was often not possible, the actual&#13;
transformation procedures used were somewhat adjusted.&#13;

Sources and Methods:&#13;
(1)   Net Material Product (NMP) produced (CSSR methodology).    (See SY 1975/162, 1979/130, 1981/138).&#13;
(2)   NMP produced in non-material communications.   Taken to be equal to the NMP produced in material communications (see SY&#13;
1976/152, 1981/138) since, in CSSR methodology, income from material communications is estimated as 50% of incomes from&#13;
communications (both material and non-material). See SNTL/ALFA (1969), p.110.&#13;
(3)   Incomes from personal rail transport.&#13;
(4)   Incomes from bus transport aitside towns.   Estimated via number of persons transported per mil. km and average price of&#13;
1 bus ticket for 10 km - 3 Rcs (see SY 1981/263).&#13;
(5)   Incomes from tramway transport in towns.&#13;
(6)   Incomes from personal airline transport.&#13;
(7)   Incomes from bus transport in towns. All data on personal transport see SY 1974/371-383, 1975/385, 1976/375, 1977/413,&#13;
1979/420-434, 1980/425-446, 1981/420-444.&#13;
(8)   Incomes from personal transport:   (3)+(4)+(5)+(6)+(7).&#13;
(9)   Cts of per         t      rt (see SY 1979/516, 1980/529, 1981/529).   For 1970-76 estimated as well as for 1980.&#13;
(10)  Net income (loss) of personal transport:   (8)+(9).&#13;
(11) NMP produced (CMEA methodology): (1)+(2)+(10).&#13;
| Because of subsidized personal transport, NMP according to the CMEA methodology is lower, in spite of the broader&#13;
concept of material sphere.&#13;

(3)   Private incomes in the NM sphere.   Data not available:  estimate based on published data on private incomes in the&#13;
material sphere (SY 1975/171, 1981/147) and an assumption of the constant ratio between private incomes in material and&#13;
NM spheres was used (in 1970, the private incomes in the NM sphere were 4663 mil. Rcs - see Rratislava (1972).&#13;
(4)   Profits of non-budgetary organizations in the non-material sphere.   Organizations operating on the "Kchozraschot"&#13;

Sources and methods:&#13;
(1) Expenditures on the final use of residential households. Obtained as a sum of private consumption (SY 1975/162,&#13;
1977/122, 1981/138 - enlarged for subsidies in personal transport - see Table 1), households' expenditures on&#13;
dwelling and other non-material services (see Table 7), excluding the material costs of dwelling services provided&#13;
for the population (see Table 7), material costs in business travel expenses (see Table 7) and the balance of direct&#13;
households' external transactions (SY 1975/484, 1977/505, 1981/525).&#13;
(2) Final consumption expenditures of government. Estimated by the costs of services provided by budgetary institutions&#13;
less incomes from these services (see Table 7) less transfers to the non-material sphere connected with the provision&#13;
of free services for employees in enterprises of both material and non-material spheres (see Table 7).&#13;
(3) Gross capital formation. Obtained as a sum of net accumulation of fixed capital and changes in stocks (SY 1975/162,&#13;
1977/122, 1981/138), depreciation in both material and non-material spheres (see Table 7) and losses on fixed capital&#13;
(see Table 2).&#13;
(4) Balance of exports minus imports. Obtained as a sum of the balance of merchandize trade (SY 1976/152, 1977/123,&#13;
1980/132, 1981/138) and the balance of direct households' external transactions (SY 1975/484, 1977/505, 1981/525).&#13;
The balance of non-material services' external transactions is omitted.&#13;

Sources and methods:&#13;
(1)  GDP based on data on primary incomes, current Kcs (mil). (See Table 2).&#13;
(2)  Official growth rates of Net Material Product (produced).   (SY 1981/143.)&#13;
(3)  Estimated real growth rates.  Our estimate is based on the asumption of an upward bias in the official growth rates;&#13;
the bias being constant and proportional to the official reported growth rate. Thel degree of bias we estimated in&#13;
the following way: we start with comparing the purchasing power parities between Czechoslovakia and Austria in 1964&#13;
(1 Austrian shilling - 0.70 Kcs) and in 1980 (1 Austrian shilling - 0.5232 Kcs) - see table in text. The Austrian&#13;
consumer price index 1980/1964 was 2.2714; officially reported consumer price index in Czechoslovakia was 1.2470 (SY&#13;
1972/486, 1981/257). From the relative change of PPP's and Austrian consumer price index In the period we obtained&#13;
an estimate of "real" Czechoslovak consumer price index for 1964-1980: 1.69. 47.9% of this price increment was&#13;
ascribed to the period 1970-1980 (proportionally to the officially reported consumer price index) giving an estimated&#13;
price index for 1980/70:1.33. The value index of GDP 1980/70 (1.58) was deflated by the estimated price index (1.33)&#13;
and the real growth of GDP is thus: 1.58/1.33 - 1.19 (approximately). This overall real GDP growth rate was&#13;
decomposed to the individual years proportionally to the official growth rates (2).&#13;
(4)  GDP based on data on primary incomes at constant (1970) prices.   (Estimated growth rate indexes (3) applied to the&#13;
value of GDP in 1970).&#13;
(5) GDP based on data on final use (see Table 7).&#13;
(6)  Official growth rates of Net Material Product (used).   (SY 1981/143.)&#13;
(7)  Estimated real growth rates for GDP based on data on final use.   The estimation procedure has the same logic as above&#13;
by (3). We deflated the official growth rates (6) by our estimate of bias (1.029).&#13;
(8)  GDP based on data on final use at constant (1970) prices.   (Estimated growth rates indexes (7) applied to the value&#13;
of GDP in 1970.)&#13;

moved to the previous years with our estimate of Czechoslovak consumer price index (1.33 for 1970) (see text).      The&#13;
estimated consumer price index is proportional to the officially reported index of retail prices (SY 1975/497,&#13;
1981/297); the average coefficient of bias is again 1.029 (see notes to Table 18). The result is thus PPP of one&#13;

saldo of Czechoslovak trade balance in 1967-1974 (in Czech), Finance a uver 10/1976, p.675). This exchange rate is&#13;

            The gross domestic product of
            Czechoslovakia, 1970-1980
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The paper considers the theoretical and
            practical problems connected with the estimation Gross
            Domestic Product (GDP) for the centrally planned economy of
            Czechoslovakia. In the methodological part the basic
            differences between the SNA (System of National Accounts)
            and MPS (Material Product System) accounting systems are
            discussed and several transformation procedures are
            presented. The price formation used in Czechoslovak MPS
            aggregates is briefly described before the problem of
            converting the data in national currency to US dollars is
            highlighted. Alternative GDP estimates, exchange rates and
            growth rates are compared. Own estimates, based on the
            purchasing parity type comparison with Austria, are
            presented in comparison with official Czechoslovak indexes.
            The appendices contain the detailed description of MPS/SNA
            transformation procedures as well as the statistical tables
            illustrating the process of GDP reconstruction based on
            Czechoslovak data for the period 1970-1990.
