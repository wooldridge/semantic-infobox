INTRODUCTION BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ICSID had another very active year in 2004. A record thirty new cases were registered.&#13;
Eighty-five arbitration and conciliation proceedings were before ICSID in the course of&#13;
the year, thirteen of which were concluded. Most of the new cases were initiated, as&#13;
before, on the basis of ICSID arbitration provisions of bilateral and multilateral investment&#13;
treaties. Membership in the Centre rose to 140 States following the ratification of the&#13;
ICSID Convention by Malta.&#13;
&#13;
During this year, ICSID has embarked on several new initiatives. The Centre has started&#13;
to promote a greater use of conciliation under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID&#13;
Additional Facility. ICSID has offered conciliation procedures since its inception, but&#13;
only about 2% of the cases registered by the Centre have been conciliation cases. This is&#13;
so despite the fact that conciliation may be a quicker and less expensive means of solving&#13;
disputes than arbitration. As part of the new initiative, in all new arbitration cases, ICSID&#13;
is bringing the conciliation alternative to the attention of the parties.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, a more general stocktaking is taking place in ICSID. A client survey is being&#13;
done of users of ICSID to identify areas of possible improvement. Other new initiatives&#13;
concern expanding and diversifying the pool of arbitrators and improving ICSID's financial&#13;
self-sufficiency. In addition, a communications assessment project has been finalized to help&#13;
fine-tune the effectiveness of ICSID's outreach efforts. The Centre is also preparing to host&#13;
the 7th IFCAI Biennial Conference on international commercial arbitration in early June 2005.&#13;
&#13;
ICSID's achievements in the past fiscal year attest to an increased confidence placed in the&#13;
Centre. Building on such trust, ICSID is now working on possible amendments to its rules&#13;
aimed at increasing transparency and public access to the proceedings. ICSID is also examining&#13;
the possibility of assisting in the establishment and administration of an international&#13;
mechanism for the appeal of awards in investor-State arbitrations.&#13;
&#13;
Apart from administering its considerably increased caseload and developing the above&#13;
initiatives, ICSID continued its publication and other knowledge dissemination activities.&#13;
The Centre published two issues of the ICSID Review--Foreign Investment Law Journal. Five new&#13;
releases of ICSID's collections of investment laws and treaties were issued and a new volume&#13;
of the treaties collection was commenced. The website also continued to grow in reach&#13;
and content. In addition, ICSID staff contributed numerous presentations to arbitration&#13;
conferences, seminars and other educational events.&#13;
&#13;
ICSID's expanding ties with the wider world of international arbitration were reflected in several&#13;
collaborative efforts with other international arbitral institutions on promoting knowledge&#13;
on international investment dispute settlement. ICSID takes pride by the election of Antonio&#13;
Parra as Secretary General of the International Council of Commercial Arbitration (ICCA)&#13;
and as a Council Member of the International Federation of Commercial Arbitration&#13;
Institutions (IFCAI). In addition, an agreement on general arrangements for cooperation in&#13;
hosting of arbitration proceedings was concluded with the Lagos Regional Centre for&#13;
International Commercial Arbitration.&#13;
&#13;
Making the ICSID system of dispute settlement as effective as possible in these and many&#13;
other ways is a goal that we will pursue in the coming year and beyond.&#13;
&#13;
Roberto Dañino&#13;
Secretary-General&#13;
                                                                                                  3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MEMBERSHIP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the past year, ICSID's membership was enlarged by the accession of a new member.&#13;
Malta became the 140th ICSID Contracting State following completion of the formal&#13;
requirements for membership in December 2003.&#13;
&#13;
A complete list of the Contracting States and other signatories of the ICSID Convention&#13;
appears in Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DISPUTES BEFORE THE CENTRE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The caseload expanded by 30 new cases registered in the course of the fiscal year. This repre-&#13;
sents a 15% increase over the cases registered in the previous year. Of the new cases, 29 were&#13;
arbitration proceedings and one a conciliation proceeding. By the end of fiscal year 2004, the&#13;
total number of cases registered with the Centre since its inception reached 159. The influx of&#13;
new proceedings resulted in a record number of 85 cases either simultaneously pending&#13;
before ICSID or concluded during the fiscal year. The largest number of the new cases were&#13;
submitted, as in previous years, under the ICSID arbitration provisions of bilateral investment&#13;
treaties. In two of the new cases, investors have sought to establish ICSID jurisdiction on the&#13;
basis of the Energy Charter Treaty. In another new case, jurisdiction was asserted under corre-&#13;
sponding provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Six of the new&#13;
cases were initiated on the basis of either investment laws of the host states or traditional&#13;
investment contracts.&#13;
&#13;
Thirteen arbitration proceedings were concluded in the period. Four of them were discontin-&#13;
ued at the request of one or both of the parties concerned following an amicable settlement of&#13;
the disputes. Awards were rendered in nine cases. In three of the concluded proceedings, the&#13;
tribunals upheld jurisdiction but dismissed the claims on the merits. Six of the awards upheld&#13;
the claims in whole or in part. Post-award proceedings were initiated in three cases. ICSID&#13;
registered two applications for annulment of awards and an application for a supplementary&#13;
decision in a NAFTA case conducted under the Additional Facility Rules. The Centre also&#13;
registered a request for resubmission of the dispute to a new tribunal following the conclusion&#13;
of an annulment proceeding in another case.&#13;
&#13;
The majority of the cases pending before the Centre during the past fiscal year involved Western&#13;
Hemisphere countries. The remaining cases were almost evenly divided among countries in&#13;
Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
One third of the current cases involve projects in the energy sector. The remaining cases&#13;
involve disputes regarding investments in virtually all other economic sectors.&#13;
&#13;
In total, 25 ICSID arbitral tribunals and two ad hoc committees were constituted in the course&#13;
of the year. Fifty-five persons from 21 different countries were appointed to serve on these&#13;
panels as ICSID arbitrators or ad hoc committee members. Proceedings before the ICSID&#13;
panels during the year were conducted in English in 32 of the cases and in French or in&#13;
Spanish in other 12 cases. Two of these three official languages of ICSID were used in differ-&#13;
ent combinations as procedural languages in the rest of the proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4                                                                                          I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In addition to administering the cases under the ICSID Convention and the Additional&#13;
Facility Rules, ICSID provided administrative services in three cases conducted under the&#13;
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law&#13;
(UNCITRAL). In one of these cases, ICSID made logistical arrangements for a video and&#13;
audio transmission synchronized in real time of the entire nine-day hearing, following a&#13;
decision of the parties and the tribunal concerned to open the hearing for attendance by&#13;
interested members of the public.&#13;
&#13;
Details on procedural developments in each of the cases pending before ICSID in fiscal year&#13;
(FY) 2004 are provided in Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PANELS OF CONCILIATORS AND OF ARBITRATORS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Under the ICSID Convention, ICSID maintains a Panel of Conciliators and a Panel of&#13;
Arbitrators. Each Contracting State may designate up to four persons to each Panel. The&#13;
Chairman of the Administrative Council may designate up to 10 persons to each Panel.&#13;
&#13;
The significant increase in the ICSID caseload makes it particularly important that the Panels&#13;
designations are complete and up-to-date. This facilitates the selection of conciliators and&#13;
arbitrators for the ICSID proceedings by the parties concerned or, where necessary under the&#13;
relevant rules, by the Chairman of the Administrative Council. During the past year, the&#13;
Secretariat reminded a number of Contracting States of the need to make or renew designa-&#13;
tions to the ICSID Panels.&#13;
&#13;
In the course of the year, the Secretariat received designations made by the following&#13;
Contracting States: Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Botswana, China, Honduras, Hungary,&#13;
Iceland, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Spain, United Kingdom, Uzbekistan and&#13;
Venezuela. With these new designations, there are now 485 members of the Panels. The&#13;
complete list of all Panel members is available on the website of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
Annex 3 to this report lists the names of the designees appointed in FY 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PUBLICATIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The eighth volume of the Centre's collection of Investment Treaties was launched in the past&#13;
year. This collection is a loose-leaf service, which is continuously updated by the Centre.&#13;
Three releases were issued in the course of the year. These added texts of some 60 recent&#13;
bilateral investment treaties, bringing the total number of treaties published in the collec-&#13;
tion to 960.&#13;
&#13;
ICSID continued to update its collection of Investment Laws of the World. The two releases issued&#13;
for this collection included new investment legislation of 12 countries: Angola, Azerbaijan,&#13;
Belarus, Benin, Belize, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Mongolia, Mozambique, Paraguay,&#13;
and Serbia and Montenegro. In total, the collection now contains basic foreign investment&#13;
laws of 150 countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
With a redesigned cover, two issues of the ICSID Review--Foreign Investment Law Journal also reached&#13;
subscribers. The Spring 2003 issue of the journal included articles on expropriation claims&#13;
under U.S. investment treaties; on effectiveness of NAFTA's Investment Chapter arbitration&#13;
proceedings; and on allocation of costs and counsel fees in investment arbitration. The Fall&#13;
2003 issue featured articles on the role of international law in the choice of law process under&#13;
the ICSID Convention; and on issues of ICSID jurisdiction in the context of international&#13;
petroleum agreements.&#13;
&#13;
ICSID's semi-annual newsletter, News from ICSID, was substantially redesigned during the fiscal&#13;
year and two new issues were published. The Spring 2003 issue featured an article on the&#13;
meaning of "expropriation" under NAFTA and the substantive protections afforded to&#13;
investors. The Winter 2003 issue contained an article on institution of ICSID arbitration&#13;
proceedings, which emphasized the evolving practice on screening and registration of requests&#13;
brought under investment treaties. Additional materials in the issue included information&#13;
regarding the election of Roberto Dañino as ICSID's Secretary-General, the new initiatives&#13;
undertaken by the Centre, and the new agreement on general arrangements concluded by&#13;
ICSID with the Lagos Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration.&#13;
&#13;
The Secretariat also published, for the International Federation of Commercial Arbitration&#13;
Institutions (IFCAI), an issue of the IFCAI Newsletter. The publication of this newsletter is an&#13;
activity undertaken by ICSID as a member of IFCAI.&#13;
&#13;
ICSID continued to maintain its website &lt;www.worldbank.org/icsid&gt; with most current infor-&#13;
mation on its activities and caseload. During the past year, the website was enlarged with an&#13;
additional downloadable version of the ICSID rules to enhance their accessibility. Decisions&#13;
and awards of some 26 most recent cases are currently posted on the website, 8 of which were&#13;
added in the course of FY 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CONFERENCES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the past year, ICSID hosted the 20th in the series of annual international arbitration&#13;
colloquia, co-sponsored with the American Arbitration Association and the International&#13;
Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce since 1983. The collo-&#13;
quium was held on November 14, 2003, in Washington, D.C. It addressed issues related to&#13;
institution of arbitration proceedings; publication of proceedings and awards; procedures&#13;
specific to arbitrations involving State parties; and applicable law. In addition, ICSID joined&#13;
the London Court of International Arbitration in organizing a symposium on international&#13;
arbitration, held in Washington, D.C., on November 15, 2003.&#13;
&#13;
ICSID staff took part in several further conferences and training seminars organized by&#13;
international organizations, governments, arbitration institutions and professional&#13;
organizations. These included training courses held in different regions of the world as&#13;
part of a program of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development for government&#13;
officials involved in investment treaties negotiations: in Port of Spain (held on September&#13;
22, 2003); in Lima (held on October 13, 2003); in Pretoria (held on March 22, 2004);&#13;
and in Cairo (held on May 16, 2004). On invitation by sponsoring government agencies,&#13;
ICSID staff presented lectures on the ICSID system at training seminars in Bogotá (held&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6                                                                                            I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
on February 5­6, 2004) and in Santiago (held on May 25­26, 2004). ICSID staff also&#13;
participated in a conference on international economic disputes convened by the Cambridge&#13;
University (held on April 1­3, 2004); a conference on petroleum dispute resolution&#13;
organized by the World Petroleum Congress in London (held on April 22, 2004);&#13;
a conference sponsored by the British Institute of International and Comparative Law's&#13;
Investment Treaty Forum (held on May 7, 2004); the Seventeenth Biennial Conference of&#13;
the International Council of Commercial Arbitration (ICCA) hosted by the China&#13;
International Trade and Arbitration Commission, as well as a Council meeting and a general&#13;
assembly of the International Federation of Commercial Arbitration Institutions (IFCAI),&#13;
in Beijing (held on May 15­18, 2004).&#13;
&#13;
The staff also contributed lectures on ICSID at several academic institutions, including the&#13;
University of Stellenbosch, American University, New York University, University of Lecce,&#13;
and the Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey. Making use of the new&#13;
technologies, part of these lectures were delivered to the students via video link, allowing for&#13;
the participation of multiple audiences in the discussions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THIRTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL MEETING&#13;
OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COUNCIL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Thirty-seventh Annual Meeting of the Administrative Council took place on&#13;
September 24, 2003, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on the occasion of the Annual&#13;
Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and the International&#13;
Monetary Fund.&#13;
&#13;
At the Meeting, the Council approved the Centre's 2003 Annual Report and its administra-&#13;
tive budget for fiscal year 2004.&#13;
&#13;
On the basis of a proposal by the Chairman, the Council elected unanimously Roberto&#13;
Dañino as Secretary-General for a term of six years.&#13;
&#13;
The Resolutions adopted at the Meeting are set forth in Annex 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FINANCE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The administrative expenditures of ICSID were, again, entirely covered by the World Bank&#13;
pursuant to the Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements concluded between the World&#13;
Bank and ICSID in February 1967, and by income from the sale of publications.&#13;
&#13;
It was therefore not necessary to assess any excess expenditures on Contracting States pursuant&#13;
to Article 17 of the Convention.&#13;
&#13;
ICSID's expenditures relating to pending arbitration and conciliation proceedings are borne&#13;
by the parties in accordance with the Centre's Administrative and Financial Regulations.&#13;
&#13;
The Financial Statements of ICSID for FY 2004 are provided in Annex 6.&#13;

&#13;
NOTE 1 ­ ORGANIZATION&#13;
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) was estab-&#13;
lished on October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of&#13;
investment disputes between States and nationals of other States. The Centre provides&#13;
such facilities for cases brought under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional&#13;
Facilities Rules, or where parties involved so request, under the Arbitration Rules of the&#13;
U.N. Commission on International Trade Law. On February 13, 1967, the International&#13;
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the Centre entered into&#13;
Administrative Arrangements which were effective as of the date of the establishment of&#13;
the Centre. The Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements (the Memorandum)&#13;
provides that, except to the extent that the Centre may be reimbursed by the parties to&#13;
proceedings for fees and expenses of members of Conciliation Commissions, Arbitral&#13;
Tribunals or ad hoc Committees, the Bank shall provide facilities and services to the&#13;
Centre, as described in Notes 2 and 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 ­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#13;
Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation: The financial statements&#13;
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the&#13;
United States of America and with International Financial Reporting Standards. Such&#13;
financial statements are presented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting&#13;
Standard No. 117, "Financial Statements of Not-For-Profit-Organizations" (SFAS No. 117). SFAS&#13;
No. 117 requires that net assets are classified in accordance with donor restrictions; however,&#13;
there are no net assets as of June 30, 2004 and 2003.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting&#13;
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to&#13;
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities&#13;
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements&#13;
and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period.&#13;
Actual results could differ from these estimates.&#13;
&#13;
Cash Equivalents: The Centre considers all highly liquid debt investments purchased with&#13;
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#13;
&#13;
Value of Services Provided by the Bank and In-kind Contributions: In accordance with&#13;

ANNEX 6 (CONTINUED)&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank provides support services and facilities to the Centre including the following:&#13;
&#13;
  (1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
  (2) other administrative services and facilities, such as travel, communications,&#13;
       office accommodations, furniture, equipment, supplies and printing.&#13;
&#13;
Revenue Recognition from Arbitration Proceedings: The Centre does not have&#13;
resources of its own. The Centre's direct expenses attributable to arbitration proceedings&#13;
are borne by the parties in accordance with the Centre's Administrative and Financial&#13;
Regulations (Regulations). In accordance with these Regulations, the Secretary-General&#13;
calls on the parties to make advance deposits with the Centre from time to time to defray&#13;
these anticipated expenses. Accordingly, the Centre recognizes revenues from these&#13;
exchange transactions during the period of and to the extent of expenses incurred related&#13;
to arbitration proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
Investment of Undisbursed Advances from Parties and Refund of Surplus to the Parties:&#13;
The Bank invests and reinvests the undisbursed advances pending payments of expenditures.&#13;
The investment income accrues to the parties and can be used for expenses related to the&#13;
arbitration process. After the completion of an arbitration proceeding, if it is determined&#13;
that there is an excess of advance and investment income over expenditures for the&#13;
proceedings, the cash surplus shall be refunded to the parties in proportion to the amounts&#13;
advanced by each party to the Centre. If the parties fail to provide the Centre the infor-&#13;
mation necessary to process the refund, the surplus will be transferred to the Bank and&#13;
applied to reduce the Bank's in-kind contribution to the Centre.&#13;
&#13;

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT&#13;
&#13;
To:    International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
We have audited the accompanying statements of financial position of the International&#13;
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) as of June 30, 2004 and 2003,&#13;
and the related statements of activities and cash flows for the years then ended. These&#13;
financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the International Bank&#13;
for Reconstruction and Development and of the Centre. Our responsibility is to express&#13;
an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.&#13;
&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the&#13;
United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to&#13;
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material&#13;
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the&#13;
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the&#13;
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as&#13;
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide&#13;
a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the&#13;
financial position of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes as of&#13;
June 30, 2004 and 2003, and the changes in its net assets and cash flows for the years&#13;
then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United&#13;
States of America.&#13;

            International Centre for Settlement of
            Investment Disputes (ICSID) 2004 annual report
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The International Centre for Settlement
            of Investment Disputes (ICSID) 2004 annual report covers the
            fiscal year July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2004. ICSID had another
            very active year in 2004. A record thirty new cases were
            registered. Eighty-five arbitration and conciliation
            proceedings were before ICSID in the course of the year,
            thirteen of which were concluded. Most of the new cases were
            initiated, as before, on the basis of ICSID arbitration
            provisions of bilateral and multilateral investment
            treaties. Membership in the Centre rose to 140 States
            following the ratification of the ICSID Convention by Malta.
            During this year, ICSID has embarked on several new
            initiatives. The Centre has started to promote a greater use
            of conciliation under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID
            Additional Facility. ICSID has offered conciliation
            procedures since its inception, but only about 2 percent of
            the cases registered by the Centre have been conciliation
            cases. This is so despite the fact that conciliation may be
            a quicker and less expensive means of solving disputes than
            arbitration. As part of the new initiative, in all new
            arbitration cases, ICSID is bringing the conciliation
            alternative to the attention of the parties. At the same
            time, a more general stocktaking is taking place in ICSID. A
            client survey is being done of users of ICSID to identify
            areas of possible improvement. Other new initiatives concern
            expanding and diversifying the pool of arbitrators and
            improving ICSID's financial self-sufficiency. In
            addition, a communications assessment project has been
            finalized to help fine-tune the effectiveness of
            ICSID's outreach efforts. The Centre is also preparing
            to host the 7th Biennial Conference of the International
            Federation of Commercial Arbitration Institutions (IFCAI) on
            international commercial arbitration in early June 2005.
