            Africa - Regional Communications
            Infrastructure Program Third Adaptable Program Loan Malawi
            Project : technical annex

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Malawi Project of
            the Regional Communications Infrastructure Program Third
            Adaptable Program in Africa is to overcome a major
            bottleneck for the communications networks in Malawi access
            to the coastal landing stations of the submarine cables.
            There are three components to the project. The first
            component of the project is enabling environment. This
            component will provide support to the overall enabling
            environment for the project. This includes project specific
            activities and general support for the sector. There are
            three sub-components to this component. The first
            sub-component is capacity building an advisory support to
            sector agencies. This subcomponent will provide technical
            capacity building and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E)
            assistance to the agencies of Government involved in the
            Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. The
            second sub-component is environmental, social and
            resettlement activities. The activities to be undertaken as
            part of this project are unlikely to have any major
            environmental or resettlement implications. The third
            sub-component is communications. This component will cover
            communications activities including a combination of project
            promotion among private-sector participants and public
            outreach activities. The second component of the project is
            connectivity. This component will support regional and
            international connectivity in Malawi through three major
            subcomponents: The first sub-component is Public Private
            Partnerships (PPP) for regional connectivity. This
            subcomponent will support regional connectivity to link
            Malawi with coastal landing stations of the submarine cables
            which are due to be completed by 2010. The second
            sub-component is enabling the establishment of a Virtual
            Landing Point (VLP). The key to the success of the project
            will be ensuring that the private sector in Malawi all have
            equal access to the regional connectivity provided under the
            project. The third sub-component is supply of broadband
            connectivity to institutions/rural access. This component
            will finance last mile connectivity to selected public
            institutions and Public Internet Access Points (PIAPs)
            within Malawi, to be provided by private operators and
            Internet Service Providers (ISPs) operating within the
            country. The third component of the project is project
            management. This component will consist of support to
            finance project management related issues: (a) a project
            manager; (b) a technical expert; (c) a procurement
            specialist; (d) a financial management specialist; (e)
            office equipment; (f) audits; and (g) other operating expenses.
