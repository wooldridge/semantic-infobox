ABSTRACT&#13;
The pervasive presence of physical interdependencies in water&#13;
resource utilization tends to produce failure of efficiency in market&#13;
allocation and in practice public sector management has become the dominant&#13;
mode of development and operation.    In particular, efficient resource use&#13;
where ground and surface waters are used conjunctively may require special&#13;
policies to rationalize the interaction between water use by farmers and&#13;
the response of the stream aquifer system. The irrigation system of the&#13;
Indus Basin of Pakistan combines conjunctive use in fresh groundwater areas&#13;
with significant drainage needs in saline groundwater areas in a basin of&#13;
over 12 million irrigated hectares underlain by a single unconfined&#13;
aquifer. In this paper, we examine alternative policies for achieving more&#13;
efficient resource utilization in the Indus Basin.&#13;
Using a simulation model which links the hydrology of a&#13;
conjunctive stream aquifer system to an economic model of agricultural&#13;
production for each of 53 regions of the basin together with a network&#13;
model of the flows in river reaches, link canals and irrigation canals&#13;
throughout the basin, we have studied the joint effect of various canal&#13;
water allocation and associated private tubewell pumping control policies&#13;
on overall system efficiency. The results suggest that large gains in&#13;
agricultural production and production are possible, given more efficient&#13;
policies. However, there are significant adjustment costs in the form of&#13;
large required drainage investments. Using the same model adapted to&#13;
assess sequentially a proposed investment program (i.e., the Revised Action&#13;
Programme, or in brief RAP, of the Water and Power Development Authority of&#13;
Pakistan), program components were aggregated into homogenous sets and&#13;
evaluated. Results indicate that the program in general would be highly&#13;
productive, but that one set was inefficient and should be eliminated from&#13;
the program. In addition, the production potential of the Indus Basin was&#13;
assessed at a 1995 horizon, utilizing estimates of reasonable technical&#13;
progress (from the RAP), projected world prices, elimination of distortions&#13;
in agricultural pricing and water allocation, and the efficient sets of the&#13;
RAP investments. Results indicated a 34 percent increase in farm income&#13;
for irrigated farmers or 1 to 2 percent per year in per capita farm&#13;
income. By 1995, all water resources were fully utilized and thereafter&#13;
gains would have to come from technical progress or substitution of more&#13;
valuable crops in cropping patterns.&#13;

L'utilisation des ressources en eau est caracteris6e par&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
La gran interdependencia fisica que existe en la utilizaci6n de los&#13;
recursos hidricos tiende a producir fallas de eficiencia si se los asigna&#13;
al mercado y, en la practica, la gesti6n del sector pdblico se convierte&#13;
en la modalidad dominante de aprovechamiento y operaci6n. En particular,&#13;
la utilizaci6n eficiente de los recursos cuando las aguas freaticas y las&#13;
superficiales se usan conjuntamente puede requerir politicas especiales&#13;
para organizar racionalmente la interacci6n entre la utilizaci6n del agua&#13;
en las explotaciones y la reacci6n del sistema acuifero. El sistema de&#13;
riego de la cuenca del Indo en Pakistan combina el uso conjunto de zonas&#13;
de capas freaticas de agua dulce con las considerables necesidades de dre-&#13;
naje en zonas de capas freaticas de agua salada en una cuenca de mas de 12&#13;
millones de hectareas regadas con un subestrato formado por un solo acui-&#13;
fero libre. En el presente documento se examinan distintas opciones de&#13;
politicas para lograr una mayor eficiencia en la utilizaci6n de recursos&#13;
en la cuenca del Indo.&#13;
Utilizando un modelo de simulaci6n que vincula la hidrologia de un&#13;
sistema acuifero alimentado por varias corrientes con un modelo econ6mico&#13;
de la producci6n agricola para cada una de las 53 regiones de la cuenca&#13;
junto con un modelo de red de los caudales en tramos del rio, los canales&#13;
de conexi6n o alimentadores y los canales de riego en toda la cuenca,&#13;
hemos estudiado el efecto conjunto de distintas asignaciones de agua a los&#13;
canales y de las politicas de control del sistema privado conexo de bombeo&#13;
de pozos entubados en la eficiencia global de todo el sistema. Los resul-&#13;
tados indican que, con politicas mAs eficientes, es posible obtener gran-&#13;
des aumentos de la producci6n agricola. Sin embargo, hay significativos&#13;
costos de ajuste ocasionados por las fuertes inversiones requeridas en&#13;
sistemas de drenaje. Utilizando el mismo modelo adaptado para evaluar&#13;
secuencialmente un programa propuesto de inversiones (es decir, el Pro-&#13;
grama de Acci6n Revisado (PAR) de la Direcci6n de Desarrollo de Agua y&#13;
Energia de Pakistan), se agruparon y evaluaron los distintos componentes&#13;
del programa en conjuntos homogeneos. Los resultados indican que, en&#13;
general, el programa seria muy productivo pero que un conjunto result6&#13;
ineficiente y debia ser eliminado del mismo. Ademas, el potencial de pro-&#13;
ducci6n de la Cuenca del Indo fue evaluado tomando 1995 como limite y uti-&#13;
lizando estimaciones sobre un progreso t6cnico razonable (obtenidas del&#13;
PAR), y proyecciones de precios mundiales, eliminando distorsiones en los&#13;
precios de productos agricolas y en la asignaci6n de recursos hidricos y&#13;
aplicando el conjunto eficiente de inversiones del PAR. Los resultados&#13;
indicaron un aumento del 34% de los ingresos de las explotaciones con sis-&#13;
tema de riego o un aumento del 1% al 2% anual en el ingreso agricola per&#13;
cApita. Para 1995, todos los recursos hidricos estarian utilizados plena-&#13;
mente y en lo sucesivo los aumentos provendrian de adelantos tecnicos o de&#13;
la sustituci6n de cultivos por otros mAs valiosos.&#13;

Summary and Conclusions&#13;
This paper reports on a study of the efficiency in allocation&#13;
of and investment in water resources for the Indus Basin of Pakistan.&#13;
Since water resource development is characterized by pervasive physical&#13;
interdependencies, the assumption usually made in economic analysis of&#13;
physical independence in production among different firms is not valid; and&#13;
the well-known arguments for the efficiency of the market allocation of&#13;
resources do not hold. While it is possible to conceive of schemes that&#13;
permit a market allocation of water resources to be efficient, the the&#13;
conditions required for this result are restrictive; and in practice water&#13;
resources are developed and operated under public sector management almost&#13;
everywhere. Unfortunately, experience has shown that the existence of&#13;
public sector management does not assure efficiency, and this conclusion&#13;
applies a fortiori when physical interdependence complicates both the&#13;
policy guidelines and the structure of incentives required for efficiency.&#13;
Given that efficiency is not assured and can only be achieved by constant&#13;
vigilance, an investigation utilizing recent advances in methods for&#13;
studying allocation under physical interdependence was proposed for an&#13;
alluvial basin in which problems stemming from interdependence were evident&#13;
and where the Bank was involved in financing water resource investments.&#13;
In consequence, a study was initiated to i) investigate the&#13;
effects of interdependence in the water resource investments of the Indus&#13;
Basin on choice of an efficient program of investments to develop the basin&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and ii) to develop a method for evaluating the efficiency of the static&#13;
allocation of water resources in the basin. The nature of the questions to&#13;
be addressed dictated a model that simulates farmer response to government&#13;
policy intervention. However, the existence of physical interdependence in&#13;
production required an explicitly hierarchical structure, with government&#13;
as policy maker and the farmers as policy receivers. The natural choice of&#13;
method was linear activity analysis since this approach permits direct&#13;
representation of physical interdependence and techniques exist for closely&#13;
approximating critical non-linearities. The resulting family of models is&#13;
unique in that agricultural production is integrated with a surface water&#13;
distribution system and a ground water aquifer system for a large river&#13;
basin. The following paragraphs present a concise review of results from&#13;
simulation experiments with the Indus model family.&#13;
Large gains in agricultural production and employment for the&#13;
Indus Basin are possible given more efficient static allocation and&#13;
management of surface waters (i.e., 17-20 percent in output and 14-16&#13;
percent in employment.l/ These gains were estimated holding everything&#13;
else constant and under conservative assumptions with respect to water&#13;
supply. They would be larger if improved technology and/or a shift to&#13;
economic prices (i.e., prices that reflect real resource scarcities) were&#13;
included in the comparison. However, these gains require optimally&#13;
coordinated use of surface and groundwaters. Necessary steps to achieve&#13;
efficient joint (i.e., conjunctive) use are:&#13;
1/ By static allocation is meant an allocation over long-run average&#13;
surface water supply, in contrast to a dynamic allocation rule which&#13;
aims at inter-temporal efficiency by taking into account random&#13;
year-to-year variation in available supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
i.   Enabling investments in drainage works in saline&#13;
groundwater areas.&#13;
ii. Eventual public control of private tubewell withdrawals&#13;
in the fresh groundwater areas by means of some combination of taxes,&#13;
subsidies, quotas, fees, prices, etc.&#13;
In the absence of enabling drainage investments, potential&#13;
gains from a different static allocation of surface waters are quite&#13;
limited.&#13;
Even without a mDre efficient allocation of surface water,&#13;
conditions i. and ii. will have to be imposed sooner or later in order to&#13;
maintain the productivity of land and water resources. However, these&#13;
conditions have significant adjustment costs in the form of large drainage&#13;
investments and the political and institutional effects of imposing&#13;
controls on tubewell pumping. Offsetting gains from other policy&#13;
components, e.g., improved surface water allocation, better agricultural&#13;
price policy, increase in adaptive agricultural R&amp;D and improved extension&#13;
services, may be necessary to achieve political feasibility.&#13;
Water-related investments can play an important enabling role&#13;
the revitalization of Pakistani agriculture. However, the benefits from&#13;
such investments are significantly affected by other aspects of policy,&#13;
especially agricultural price policy and policy toward technical progress&#13;
(e.g., adaptive agricultural R&amp;D and improved extension services). Thus,&#13;
agricultural policy must be broadly based, with all components coordinated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
toward common objectives in an efficient way. That is, if price and&#13;
technical efficiency are not achieved, water resource investments will have&#13;
lower productivity.&#13;
The proposed irrigation investment program for Pakistan in&#13;
the 1980s - the Revised action Program (RAP) - will prove highly&#13;
productive in the main if especially condition i. (i.e. enabling drainage&#13;
investments) and eventually condition ii. (i.e., public control of tubewell&#13;
withdrawals) are met in implementing a policy of more efficient allocation&#13;
of surface waters and if parallel advances in promoting technical progress&#13;
in agriculture and an improved agricultural price policy are achieved.&#13;
When interdependence in investments is taken into account, all but one of&#13;
the sets of water resource investments included in the RAP were highly&#13;
productive and efficient at the margin. The RAP without the investment set&#13;
that is an inefficient part of the program, i.e., the efficient sets of the&#13;
RAP, should have a very high internal economic rate of return (25 to 40&#13;
percent) if the non-water resource investments of the RAP are efficiently&#13;
implemented. However, these investments must be accompanied by the&#13;
requisite complementary investments. In particular, the associated&#13;
drainage investments required to sustain the productivity of land and water&#13;
resources should be made at the same time.&#13;
Given the existing irrigation infrastructure and other&#13;
agricultural resources and fixed canal diversions, a shift to economic&#13;
(i.e., border) prices would increase agricultural value added (at domestic&#13;
prices) by 27 percent, with virtually no effect on agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
employment. If the change in output is valued at economic prices initially&#13;
as well as terminally, the increase is 12 percent. Moreover, the large&#13;
increase in farm income would induce a private tubewell and tractor&#13;
investment boom and the changes in relative prices would cause an increase&#13;
in cropping intensity and significant shifts in cropping pattern toward&#13;
crops for which Pakistan has comparative advantage -- i.e., more rice and&#13;
oilseeds, less cotton and sugar, and about the same acreage in wheat. The&#13;
large gain in agricultural output is much greater than the losses from&#13;
implicit taxation of agricultural commodities and any increase in food&#13;
grain subsidy costs.&#13;
Adoption of an efficient water allocation and economic prices&#13;
could reasonably lead to a basinwide output increase of 200 percent (over&#13;
the 1977 level) by 1995 if the efficient sets of RAP investments were&#13;
made. In per capita terms, the increase in income is 34 percent for&#13;
irrigated farmers when both population increase and the effect of irrigated&#13;
area extension are taken into account, which is a 1 to 2 percent per year&#13;
increase in per capita farm income.&#13;
The combination of more efficient surface water allocation an&#13;
implementation of the efficient sets of RAP investment will result in&#13;
complete utilization of Pakistan's water resource endowment by 1995.&#13;
Thereafter, gains in agricultural output will have to come from technical&#13;
progress and substitution of more valuable for less valuable crops in&#13;
cropping patterns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Since water resource investments may have an environmental&#13;
impact, direct or indirect, that either requires additional investments at&#13;
later date or eliminates the need for investments that would otherwise be&#13;
required to preserve resource productivity, rigorous appraisal of water&#13;
resource investments with significant environmental impact should be done&#13;
with reference to cases for which the environmental impact has been taken&#13;
into account. For the example of Tarbela Dam, neglect of environmental&#13;
impacts, which are favorable, leads to an understatement of incremental&#13;
benefits by 38 percent at domestic prices and 59 percent at economic&#13;
prices.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
The objective of this paper is to present some of the experiences&#13;
and results from a five year study of the irrigated agriculture of the&#13;
Indus Basin of Pakistan. The focus of this investigation has been dual,&#13;
including both the planning of water-related investments and the management&#13;
of the vast Indus Basin irrigation system. Along the way it became clear&#13;
that these objectives could not be realized without enlarging the scope of&#13;
the study to include some important physical interdependences of irrigated&#13;
agriculture with its environment. The introduction of these externalities&#13;
meant that rational planning had to incorporate resource preservation as a&#13;
constraint in evaluation of investment programs and assessment of&#13;
irrigation system performance.&#13;
This study had its origin in the World Bank's involvement as&#13;
executing agent of a UNDP funded "Master Planning" effort by the Water and&#13;
Power Development Authority (WAPDA) of Pakistan to prepare a "Revised&#13;
Action Programme" (RAP) for irrigation investments in the basin. This&#13;
would update the "Action Programme" set out by a similar planning effort in&#13;
the 1960s.- It became apparent as this effort got underway that technical&#13;
advances in the intervening years had made possible significant improvement&#13;
in the methodology of planning water-related investments. In particular,&#13;
it now appeared possible to treat the conjunctive use of surface and ground&#13;
waters in a rigorous analysis that did not oversimplify environmental&#13;
detail to the point of irrelevance, and this treatment in turn could be&#13;
integrated with a sophisticated analysis of agricultural production&#13;
response including private investments in tubewells and tractors. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the achievement of these advances would require state-of-the-art modelling&#13;
skills and access to the latest in computer hardware and software. For&#13;
these reasons, the Development Research Center of the Bank was encouraged&#13;
to undertake the modelling effort, more or less in parallel with the WAPDA&#13;
Master Planning Project. In addition, successful completion of the&#13;
proposed innovations in the modelling of ground and surface hydrology based&#13;
agriculture would have application to similar problems in irrigated regions&#13;
of other countries -- e.g., the North China Plain, the Gangetic Plain of&#13;
India. The substantial data collection effort incident to the Master&#13;
Planning Project could be utilized in the modelling effort, with&#13;
significant savings in cost. However, because of some delays in acquiring&#13;
the survey data and some unexpected problems in model verification, model&#13;
development and subsequent simulation experiments were completed after the&#13;
Master Planning Project. This was just as well since the finished RAP&#13;
recommendations have provided a basis for the investment program evaluation&#13;
experiments that have demonstrated the model's ability to perform this&#13;
task. It now seems obvious that model evaluation of the investment program&#13;
had to follow program formulation. While we can conceive of using a model&#13;
in program formulation, this methodological step must wait on the&#13;
acceptance of advanced modelling methods by pragmatic planners.&#13;
The resulting Indus Basin family of models has demonstrated a&#13;
capacity for providing answers to a variety of policy-relevant questions.&#13;
For example, issues of mechanization, technical change and agricultural&#13;
price policy as well as irrigation system management and evaluation of&#13;
investment projects and programs. To date, these models have been used in&#13;
three project appraisals in the Bank and there are several more prospective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

applications of this type. However, these models may well have more&#13;
potential utility to Government of Pakistan policy makers than to the World&#13;
Bank. This possibility was noted early on by the Planning Division of&#13;
WAPDA; and a team of WAPDA programmers and systems analysts was trained at&#13;
the Bank to effect the transfer of this modelling technology to Pakistan.&#13;
In particular, they developed under our direction a variant of the model&#13;
family specifically adopted to WAPDA's needs.&#13;
The program of the paper is as follows: The next section&#13;
presents a description of the Indus model family structure followed by a&#13;
review of model validation. These are followed by some results from&#13;
simulation experiments for evaluation of (i) an investment project and (ii)&#13;
an investment program (i.e., the RAP recommendations). Subsequent sections&#13;
deal in turn with an analysis of Indus irrigation system management and&#13;
simulation experiments for some improved policies, the income distribu-&#13;
tional implications of the improved policies and the potential for growth&#13;
of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan.&#13;
II. Model Structure&#13;
The structure of any model must necessarily be designed to&#13;
provide unambiguous answers to a restricted set of questions. Since the&#13;
Indus Basin study is concerned with policy and planning of the agricultural&#13;
sector in an essentially arid environment, the important questions are&#13;
directed toward the efficient allocation and preservation of the one scarce&#13;
natural resource, water. The irrigation system which is the object of this&#13;
study has antecedents right back to the dawn of the neolithic agricultural&#13;
revolution, but it has largely been built up over the past century. It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
the largest single irrigation system in the world, consisting of over&#13;
40,000 miles of canals serving some 90,000 watercourse commands (with over&#13;
a quarter million miles of irrigation ditches) that command over 30 million&#13;
acres.&#13;
In the past, many economic models concerned with policy and&#13;
planning have been straightforward optimizing models. While admirably&#13;
direct, this approach neglects an important aspect of the economic policy&#13;
environment. Models designed for policy analysis normally involve two kinds&#13;
of agents: policy makers and policy receivers.     If the policy receivers are&#13;
optimizing agents, one is faced with a hierarchical decision-making&#13;
problem. In the case of the Indus Basin models, the government plays the&#13;
role of the policy maker, while the farmers play the role of the policy&#13;
receivers. The government decides on water-related investments and surface&#13;
water allocations, and sets (some) agricultural prices, taxes and/or&#13;
subsidies. The farmers, in turn, react to the setting of these policy&#13;
instruments by using water (both surface and ground water) and other&#13;
inputs, making private investments in tractors, tubewells, etc., and&#13;
choosing cropping patterns so as to maximize their own welfare. Generally&#13;
speaking, the strategy of the Indus family of models is to separate&#13;
analytically the two types of decision-makers by simulating the response of&#13;
the policy receivers to the actions of the policy makers in the model per&#13;
se and to represent the actions of the policy makers by changes in model&#13;
structure and/or parameters. However, there are exceptions to this rule,&#13;
particularly in the instance of policy constraints due to physical&#13;
externalities (e.g., surface-ground water interactions) that are not&#13;
recognized by policy receivers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
The artifical redistribution of water is costly, and requires&#13;
joint management of ground and surface water. In many areas of the Indus&#13;
Basin, for instance, tubewell development has not occurred, so that&#13;
sustained application of canal water over decades has induced a continual&#13;
rise in the water table. In some areas the water table is already quite&#13;
near the surface, thereby creating problems of waterlogging and salinity.&#13;
Such conditions reduce the productivity of the land, or even take it out of&#13;
production. On the other hand, too many tubewells in a region may result&#13;
in a mining of the aquifer, and a possible influx of saline water into a&#13;
sweet water aquifer.&#13;
Even under the assumption that ground and surface water can be&#13;
properly managed so as to avoid disastrous future consequences, there is&#13;
still the basic problem of water allocation. Water forms the lifeblood of&#13;
agriculture in Pakistan, and is a scarce resource. As the flow of water&#13;
can be controlled and diverted at many points in the surface water system,&#13;
it is necessary to devise efficient water allocation schemes that will&#13;
optimize some measure of regional welfare. This cannot be done without&#13;
considering the use of water on individual farms. The Indus Basin Model&#13;
Family was designed to relate agricultural development to the combined use&#13;
and management of ground and surface water by incorporating these&#13;
individual components into a unified mathematical framework.&#13;
The basic structure of the Indus Basin Model can be visualized as&#13;
follows. The entire basin is partioned into 53 irrigated regions, referred&#13;
to as polygons. Each polygon is essentially homogeneous with respect to&#13;
ground water quality, and preserves boundaries that are significant to the&#13;
ground water aquifer system. Figure 1 shows the details of the partition&#13;
&#13;

into polygons. Linkages in water supply that arise from seepage of surface&#13;
water to the aquifer and withdrawal of ground water via tubewells or&#13;
capillary action as well as underflows between polygons are explicitly&#13;
modeled for each polygon, thereby interlocking the polygons. Each polygon&#13;
also receives surface water on a monthly basis from one or more control&#13;
points of the surface water delivery system. Figure 2 presents the&#13;
schematic diagram of the Indus Basin Irrigation System, which identifies&#13;
the control points where diversions to individual canal commands are made,&#13;
and Figure 3 shows the mapping of canal commands onto polygons.&#13;
In order to embed those differences in soils, climate, etc., that&#13;
create regional comparative advantage in different crops, model cropping&#13;
technologies were specialized to nine agro-climatic zones (ACZs), and the&#13;
mapping of polygons into ACZs is given in Figure 4. The data for the&#13;
differentiation of the basin into ACZ specific cropping technologies were&#13;
largely derived from the 2,000 farm sample of the Master Planning Expanded&#13;
Agro-Economic Survey. The ACZs are essentially those of the RAP, except&#13;
that we distinguish between north and south zones in Sind Province. Table&#13;
1 gives average cropping patterns for the several ACZs as some evidence of&#13;
the appropriateness of the partition.&#13;
The surface water distribution system must be superimposed on the&#13;
complex mapping of groundwater areas (i.e., polygons), canal commands and&#13;
ACZs. This is done by means of a network formulation. All of the flows of&#13;
the schematic for the Indus Basin Irrigation System are represented as&#13;
directed flows along segments, which are the arcs between one control point&#13;
or node and another. Figure 5 shows the transformation of the system&#13;
schematic into a matrix of directed flows along segments. In this&#13;

representation, the sources are rim stations and tributary inflows and&#13;
their corresponding nodes. The sinks of the network are the canal commands&#13;
and the Arabian Sea. This formulation does seem to make the relation&#13;
between canal commands and polygons a kind of black box. Actually, the&#13;
transfer of water to polygons is accomplished in the network formulation,&#13;
while accounting for losses is handled in the polygonal sub-models via some&#13;
formidable looking but mathematically well-behaved algebra.&#13;
In addition to the above-mentioned water constraints, each&#13;
polygonal model has embedded in it a single farm level model to charac-&#13;
terize the agricultural production system of the area. Such a farm level&#13;
model simulates the resource alloction choices of a single representative&#13;
farmer which determine the production and disposition of 11 crops and 4&#13;
livestock commodities. Exogenous resource limitations are imposed on land,&#13;
labor and canal water. The water supply and demand constraint of each farm&#13;
level model includes estimates of water available from rainfall, evapotran-&#13;
spiration from the aquifer, the exogenous supply of canal and government&#13;
tubewell water, and the endogenous supply of private tubewell water.&#13;
However, when used to evaluate water allocation policies, canal water allo-&#13;
cations are sometimes endogenous. There is, of course, great uncertainty&#13;
associated with the availability of surface water, and estimates are based&#13;
on long-term averages and worst cases. The uncertainty associated with the&#13;
amount of rainfall is not so important as its contribution to the overall&#13;
water supply is almost negligible. A detached coefficient tableau for the&#13;
polygonal farm level models is given in Table 2. Note that the column&#13;
headings denote sets of variables whose values are determined in the&#13;
solution of the model, while the row headings denote sets of constraints or&#13;
equations imposing conditions that the solution values must meet. The&#13;

model maximizes the objective function, which is farm income less a risk&#13;
premium term. The risk term essentially linearizes a non-linear&#13;
mean-standard deviation of income trade-off surface. Moreover, farm income&#13;
enters into the linear family consumption constraints, and it can be shown&#13;
that this formulation is equivalent to maximizing a non-linear utility or&#13;
weighting function that places great emphasis on meeting family consumption&#13;
needs. However, these needs may be met either' via farm production or&#13;
purchases, as the commodity balances indicate. In this way, the model&#13;
permits specialization in accord with regional comparative advantage. Note&#13;
that crop and livestock production are integrated with livestock providing&#13;
endogenous bullock draft power supplies to cropping activities and cropping&#13;
providing endogenous fodder supplies to livestock activities. Tractor&#13;
draft power and tubewell water supplies are also endogenous in the sense&#13;
that capacities can be augmented by endogenous investment activities and&#13;
levels of usage of tractor services and tubewell water are determined in&#13;
the model solution. Working capital requirements are cumulated in an&#13;
annual balance, and this total enters into the balance determining farm&#13;
income. The water constraint, although conventional, deserves comment.&#13;
Note that the sources of water for cropping show only private tubewell and&#13;
canal water, both of which are shown as endogenous. This is due to a&#13;
treatment of rainfall and sub-irrigation which nets them out on a per acre&#13;
basis from the crop water requirement coefficients. This approach makes&#13;
crop use of rainfall and sub-irrigation endogenous since an acre of land&#13;
must be cropped in a given month if these supplies are to be available for&#13;
use. The treatment of canal water supplies is netted down to the root&#13;
zone, and the specification is only endogenous when the basinwide model is&#13;

being solved for an endogenous canal water allocation. If the allocation&#13;
of canal water is exogenous, as it is in some experiments, then the canal&#13;
water supply shifts to become a right-hand side constant. Although it is&#13;
not shown in the tableau, all polygonal models have a ground water balance&#13;
constraint, which may be deleted in certain solutions. Briefly put, this&#13;
constraint forces equality between additions to and withdrawals from the&#13;
aquifer. The presence of this constraint is crucial to the solutions of&#13;
the basinwide model with endogenous canal water allocation. Without it,&#13;
the solution is not an equilibrium in the sense that it would be&#13;
indefinitely sustainable.&#13;
Given the nature of the labor and capital markets in Pakistan, it&#13;
is assumed that there are no labor or capital links between polygons.1/&#13;
This implies that the only links between the polygons are the underground&#13;
flows between them. Although polygons can be aggregated into either&#13;
provinces or agro-climatic zones for reporting purposes, the lack of&#13;
economic linkages between polygons eliminates the need to consider any&#13;
intermediate level in the hierarchy between government and polygonal&#13;
farmers. Another important simplification is the assumption of constant&#13;
prices. This simplification can be justified in the case of major food&#13;
grains and cash crops on the grounds that these prices are jointly&#13;
determined by world prices and policy intervention. Livestock products and&#13;
minor food grains are more of a problem, but consistent results are&#13;
1/ Single all polygonal mDdel solutions show zero shadow prices on labor&#13;
in most months, there is little incentive for rural-to-rural migration&#13;
of labor; and casual empirical observation confirms this observation.&#13;

obtained through reginal price differentials on these largely untraded&#13;
goods. Given the size of the overall model, endogenizing prices is outside&#13;
the scope of available software.&#13;
The original Indus Basin Model was a linear programming problem&#13;
with more than 20,000 constraints, with an objective function for the&#13;
basinwide model that is simply the sum of the objective functions of the&#13;
polygonal sub-models. A model of this size exceeds the capability of&#13;
existing software for linear programs, and it was apparent early on that a&#13;
special simplification would be needed. By converting the height of the&#13;
water table in each polygon to a policy instrument, structural&#13;
simplifications could be made such that the entire model contains less than&#13;
8,000 constraints which is solvable using a large machine and commercial&#13;
software.&#13;
The above introduction has been brief and has ignored many fine&#13;
modeling details. It also has made no mention of the extensive data&#13;
gathering efforts that have taken place partially in support of the model.&#13;
Despite this brevity and the lack of any mathematical equations (a detailed&#13;
model statement is almost 40 pages), the reader will have gotten some&#13;
impression of the size, structure and complexities that are captured by the&#13;
system. Readers desiring a complete description of model structure may&#13;
obtain this from the authors.&#13;
As individual farmers do not recognize their individual effects&#13;
on ground water equilibrium which must be maintained over the long-run, the&#13;
government must take into account the long-term consequences of any water&#13;
allocation scheme and the impact of water related investments on&#13;
equilibrium. This expresses precisely the two-level aspect of the Indus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
Basin Model where some constraints are not formally recognized by the&#13;
farmers (the policy receivers) even though the government (the policy&#13;
maker) requires that they be satisfied. How the government might&#13;
accomplish this task is explained in detail in the Appendix to this paper,&#13;
which is taken from Bisschop, Candler, Duloy and O'Mara. Briefly stated,&#13;
the main result is that if groundwater balance is imposed, the dual&#13;
variable (i.e., shadow price) corresponding to this constraint is the&#13;
tax or subsidy which would induce farmers to pump tubewells at the level&#13;
required for groundwater balance.&#13;
III. Calibration, Estimation of Water Loss Characteristics and Validation&#13;
The Indus Basin Model is a comparative statical model that&#13;
simulates producer response to policy intervention. That is, it can be&#13;
used to compare producer response to different environments, where the&#13;
environmental change is wrought by policy intervention, in the sense of&#13;
complete producer adjustment (i.e., long run response) to environmental&#13;
change. Therefore, the important function of model validation is not&#13;
appropriately accomplished when actual historical conditions on a&#13;
year-by-year basis are used to simulate a dynamic path of producer&#13;
adjustment. Rather, average conditions in some base period should be used&#13;
to generate model solutions that can be compared with an average of actual&#13;
producer responses in the base period, on the assumption that producer&#13;
responses on the whole are close to long run equilibrium. This latter&#13;
assumption rules out selection of base periods that are characterized by&#13;
rapid change in one or more important aspects for which producer response&#13;
is typically lagged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In the light of such considerations, two time periods were&#13;
considered for validation runs, the periods of 1967-75 and 1975-80. The&#13;
former period includes responses that are subsequent to both the intro-&#13;
duction of the new, green revolution, varieties of wheat and rice and the&#13;
initiation of use of Mangla Reservoir, and are prior to the initiation of&#13;
the use of Tarbela Reservoir. The latter period contains the history of&#13;
post-Tarbela producer responses. Thus, both periods meet almost all of the&#13;
criteria for an appropriate base period. While the post-Tarbela period&#13;
does not meet these criteria quite so well, it is important both for the&#13;
evidence it contains on the impact of Tarbela, and because better data are&#13;
available for this more recent period.&#13;
Since many model parameters are estimated from survey data, the&#13;
choice of a base period is severely constrained by the availability of good&#13;
survey data. In particular, the major source of data on agricultural&#13;
produc tion is the Agricultural Economics Survey of the Master Planning and&#13;
Review Division of WAPDA covering the 1976-77 summer (kharif) and winter&#13;
(rabi) crop seasons. This circumstance dictated choice of the 1975-80&#13;
period for the specification of parameters relating to agricultural&#13;
production. In addition, the primary sources on agricultural machinery&#13;
(including tubewells) and live stock were the Government of Pakistan&#13;
Special Censuses of 1975 and 1976 respectively on these subjects.&#13;
Therefore, it seemed natural to initialize all time dependent parameters&#13;
for the 1975-80 period since so many model parameters would be derived from&#13;
data of that vintage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
However, the crucial parameters from the viewpoint of model&#13;
performance are the availabilities (mean) of surface water from rim&#13;
stations and tributary flows, historical diversions by canal command, the&#13;
reservoir capacities for interseasonal transfer of water and the loss&#13;
characteristics of the surface water distribution system. These quantities&#13;
are known for both the 1967-75 and 1975-80 periods (except for uncertainty&#13;
with respect to loss characteristics) and comparison of model validation&#13;
experiments for the two periods essentially measures the response of the&#13;
system to differences in these crucial parameters.&#13;
A. Estimation of System Water Loss Characteristics&#13;
As we shall see, the experiments reported are actually&#13;
experiments to select a set of water loss parameters that permit the model&#13;
to acceptably reproduce important aspects of both production response --&#13;
e.g., the cropping patterns and intensities of Table 1 -- and the state of&#13;
the groundwater aquifer. This procedure presupposes prior calibration of&#13;
the specification of agricultural technology and producer behavior, which&#13;
was done previously on a polygon-by-polygon basis. The procedure for&#13;
calibrating single farm level models is well known and need not be&#13;
discussed here.&#13;
The existence of significant uncertainty with respect to the loss&#13;
characteristics of the surface water system was unanticipated. Perhaps&#13;
some what naively, it had been assumed that these characteristics, which&#13;
are subject to measurement, would be known with some precision by the&#13;
operators of a system with as long a history as the surface water&#13;
irrigation system of the Indus Basin. This assumption turned out to be&#13;
incorrect, although this state of affairs did not become evident until&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
several seminars that discussed earlier attempts at model validation had&#13;
been held. In particular, the seminars disclosed expert opinions with&#13;
respect to losses from canals and watercourses that turned out to have a&#13;
fairly shaky empirical basis. Moreover, these expert opinions differed&#13;
markedly from those held just ten years earlier by experts on the Indus&#13;
irrigation system.    For example, our first formulation of canal losses was&#13;
criticized as much too low. Yet, when expert consultants were engaged to&#13;
evaluate this formulation, their conclusion was that it might well be&#13;
correct. Apparently too little is known about the physical parameters&#13;
controlling canal losses in the Indus Basin to be more specific. It also&#13;
became apparent that the empirical basis for current opinion with respect&#13;
to total losses on watercourses is also quite limited.&#13;
Our response to the existence of significant uncertainty with&#13;
respect to loss characteristics of the surface water system has had to be&#13;
agnostic. That is, our approach to estimation has been to test the model&#13;
with several specifications of system loss characteristics representing a&#13;
spectrum of plausible scenarios concerning system performance.     In order to&#13;
keep the number of validation experiments within reasonable bounds, these&#13;
scenarios were restricted to specification of a limited number of cases&#13;
covering the range of likely loss characteristics. In particular, two&#13;
levels of canal losses and three levels of watercourse and field losses&#13;
were specified, for a total of six cases. The details of the specification&#13;
of these cases are given in Table 3. Note especially that the high&#13;
efficiency assumption with respect to watercourse and field losses is at&#13;
the level specified in the Indus Special Study or "Lieftinck Report," which&#13;
presents in detail the planning exercise behind the appraisal of the&#13;

Tarbela Dam project in the mid 1960s. In contrast, the low efficiency&#13;
assumption with respect to watercourse and field losses is at the level&#13;
specified in the recently completed Revised Action Programme of the Master&#13;
Planning and Review Division of the Water and Power Development Authority&#13;
of Pakistan.&#13;
In addition to varying assumptions with respect to the physical&#13;
parameters affecting irrigation system losses, irrigation experts have&#13;
detected losses stemming from the behavior of system operators and their&#13;
farmer clients. The logic behind these "operating losses" is simple&#13;
economic theory. When water has a zero opportunity cost, it does not pay&#13;
optimizing economic agents to expend scarce resources in conserving water.&#13;
Hence, in the height of the kharif flow, when water conserved has zero&#13;
value--it will only go to sea--system operation becomes very "loose" and&#13;
losses increase. Conversely, in transitional months and in rabi, when&#13;
water has a positive and often high opportunity cost, system operation&#13;
becomes very "taut" and losses decrease.2/ Note that when system&#13;
operators deliver water to farmers either in unwanted quantities or when it&#13;
is not needed, the resulting watercourse delivery and field application&#13;
losses should properly be attributed to inefficient canal system&#13;
operation. Moreover, in Pakistan, the mid-kharif period of surplus water&#13;
is also the period in which most of the annual rainfall is concentrated.&#13;
System inflexibility and lack of timely information on the actual&#13;
distribution of rainfall combine to make it difficult to regulate the&#13;
system so as to fully utilize effective rainfall and thus provide another&#13;
2/ This argument assumes that system operators neglect the drainage cost&#13;
implications of excessive deliveries.&#13;

source of operational losses in kharif. It seems clear that the&#13;
measurement of operational losses presents some difficulties. For this&#13;
reason, there is apparently a paucity of careful measurements of&#13;
operational losses and analysts seem to rely on rough estimates. For&#13;
example, Ljung and Bridge have estimated the operational losses in&#13;
Maharashtra State (of India) at 50 percent in kharif and 10 percent in&#13;
rabi, although no supporting data or calculations are given. It seems to&#13;
us that the five to one ratio for slack versus taut supply situations of&#13;
Ljung and Bridge is too high to reflect the operational losses of the Indus&#13;
Basin system, if for no other reason than the considerable inflexibility of&#13;
that system. Therefore, we have assumed a two to one ratio for all the&#13;
experiments discussed in this paper.&#13;
In addition to the problems posed by uncertainty with respect to&#13;
irrigation system loss characteristics and the complication of operational&#13;
losses, the initial validation attempts for the model disclosed a tendency&#13;
toward simulation of fodder crop acreages significantly in excess of those&#13;
observed for the irrigated areas of the basin. This problem was ultimately&#13;
traced to oversight of an often neglected but important source of animal&#13;
fodder in the Indus Basin--the weeds that are produced along with the&#13;
crop. The practice in Pakistan is for the women and children to&#13;
periodically pick these weeds, both for fodder and crop cultivation&#13;
purposes. The importance of this fodder source is attested by the strong&#13;
resistance of Indus farmers to the adoption of either herbicides or&#13;
mechanical cultivation. In effect, the practice is one of intercropping&#13;
food grain and/or cash crops with a kind of fodder crop. Estimates of the&#13;
"weeds" yield that produced sensible fodder acreages in model solutions&#13;
were also reasonable from the point of view of yield from an informal&#13;

B.   Results from Model Runs Estimating Loss Parameters and Validating&#13;
Model Performance&#13;
Solutions to the model configured for historical simulation with&#13;
time dependent parameter estimates from the 1975-80 period and with surface&#13;
water diversions and reservoir capacity appropriate to the base periods&#13;
1967- 75 and 1975-80 were obtained.3/ The results from, the validation&#13;
runs covering the six cases specified in Table 3, are summarized in the&#13;
following discussion.&#13;
The validation experiments specify exogenously the level of the&#13;
watertable and the surface water allocation for each polygon. Thus, one&#13;
important validation test is whether or not a given water loss&#13;
specification of the model acceptably reproduces the observed production&#13;
response of farmers to the historically given gross canal water supplies.&#13;
Another is whether or not the calculated net recharge is consistent with&#13;
available evidence on the state of the aquifer. Important aspects of&#13;
farmer response include cropping patterns, cropping intensities and&#13;
livestock holdings. The simulated values of these aspects of farmer&#13;
response are compared with some observed values in Table 4.4/&#13;
A quick scan of the several cases for both the Pre- and&#13;
Post-Tarbela water diversions establishes that the B2A2 case--i.e., high&#13;
canal losses, medium efficiency for watercourse delivery and field&#13;
3/ Since canal water diversions were fixed exogenously, the model could be&#13;
solved piecemeal, i.e., polygon by polygon.&#13;
4/ Observed values are the average of crop acreages from the 1972 Census&#13;
of Agriculture and 1975-76 provincial estimates. Animal stocks are&#13;
from the Livestock Census of 1976.&#13;

application--as the one most closely approximating observed cropping&#13;
intensities and patterns.5/ For that reason, some additional comment on&#13;
the cropping patterns and livestock holdings from the B2A2 solutions is&#13;
pertinent. Note that simulated acreages for rice, cotton, wheat and&#13;
sugarcane are all within 7 percent of observed values with pre-Tarbela&#13;
allocation and 11 percent for the post-Tarbela allocation. The fodder&#13;
crops vary as much as 20 percent from the mean of observed acreages, but&#13;
this is largely due to an overestimate of holdings of buffalo and cattle&#13;
cows. This overestimate in turn reflects an inability to adequately&#13;
reflect risk in livestock production (due to a paucity of relevant data).&#13;
The minor crops of maize and rabi oilseeds are within 10 percent of&#13;
observed acreages. On the other hand, the pulse crop, gram, varies by 17&#13;
and 57 percent from observed acreages. However, several factors suggest&#13;
that these deviations are of minor significance: (1) The absolute acreages&#13;
involved are small in relation to both total cropped acreage and total crop&#13;
water demand; (2) data on actual acreages of minor crops are less reliable;&#13;
and (3) in a fixed price mDdel, simulated acreages of minor crops are very&#13;
sensitive to parameter specification and in consequence convey little real&#13;
information about the state of the system.&#13;
Another useful test of the simulation results is a comparison of&#13;
simulated versus actual value added per person. This test, which is&#13;
5/  Although the mDdel is calibrated with data from 1975-77, the pre-&#13;
Tarbela diversions provides less water in most months and hence&#13;
cropping intensity is less than with the post-Tarbela diversions.&#13;
Since the "observed" crop acreages are an average of pre- and early&#13;
post-Tarbela years when diversions had not yet fully reflected the&#13;
impact of Tarbela, the pre-Tarbela diversions should result in cropping&#13;
intensity and crop acreages closer to the observed ones than the&#13;
post-Tarbela diversions.&#13;

presented in Table 5, looks for consistency of simulated values with an&#13;
estimate derived from an independent source. Clearly, the B2A2 solution&#13;
provides the best match with an independent estimate.&#13;
Since the validation experiments are oriented primarily toward&#13;
the identification of the most likely set of estimates of system loss&#13;
parameters, a comparison of groundwater balances is crucial to the&#13;
determination of that set. This comparison is given in Tables 6a, 6b and&#13;
6c for the entire Indus Basin, and Punjab and Sind Provinces.6/ Given the&#13;
marked variation in relative impact of the several sources of additions and&#13;
withdrawals between Punjab and Sind Provinces, separate examination of the&#13;
groundwater balances for these Provinces is required. Turning to the&#13;

balance for the entire basin, presented in Table 6a, it is clear that&#13;
solutions B1A2, B2A2 and B3A2 are plausible representations of the state of&#13;
the aquifer prior to Tarbela--i.e., a slightly rising or falling watertable&#13;
overall. By a similar argument, it might be asserted that solutions BlAl,&#13;
B2A1 and B3A1 plausibly describe the state of the aquifer after Tarbela.&#13;
When the balances for Punjab (in Table 6b) are examined, once again the&#13;
experiments partition into the same disjoint sets that are plausible only&#13;
before or after Tarbela. The groundwater balances for Sind Province&#13;
(presented in Table 6c) indicate that only solutions B2A2, B3A1 and B3A2&#13;
are plausible if the evidence for a rising watertable in Sind is accepted.&#13;
Of these, solution B3A2, which implies an average rise of 0.6 feet per year&#13;
is least plausible.&#13;
Clearly the Indus Basin cannot be characterized by one set of&#13;
water loss parameters Pre-Tarbela and another set Post-Tarbela. There is&#13;
no physical basis for such a discontinuity. In addition, many of the model&#13;
parameters are calibrated for the early Post-Tarbela years. Now, the&#13;
response of farmers to a major structural change in the Indus system such&#13;
as Tarbela will not be instantaneous. In particular, complementary private&#13;
investments in tubewells and tractors will be induced by such a change, but&#13;
with some lag. Therefore, in order to evaluate the long run response of&#13;
farmers to Tarbela water, the validation experiments were repeated for the&#13;
case tentatively identified as the most likely specification, B2A2, with&#13;
endogenous investment activities in tubewell and tractor capacity included&#13;
in the polygonal models where appropriate. While the results from these&#13;
solutions will be discussed more fully in Section IV, the comparison of&#13;
balance items from the groundwater balances of these solutions in Table 7&#13;

is most instructive. Looking at the row for fresh groundwater areas&#13;
Pre-Tarbela, it is clear that a falling watertable would have been worsened&#13;
by continued tubewell investments in the absence of Tarbela reservoir. The&#13;
same row for the Post-Tarbela allocation shows that a rising watertable is&#13;
driven to approximate balance by complimentary tubewell investments. On&#13;
the other hand, the rising watertable in the saline groundwater areas is&#13;
exacerbated by Tarbela water since private tubewell investments make no&#13;
sense in these areas. This result corresponds to an unfortunate fact of&#13;
life in the Indus   Basin:  increased canal water diversions imply increased&#13;
seepage to groundwater and ultimately a drainage problem in saline areas.&#13;
The evidence presented in Table 7 has led to an interpretation of&#13;
the short run impact of Tarbela water which suggests that significant&#13;
positive recharge of the aquifer was the logical consequence of the&#13;
increased canal water diversions Post-Tarbela. The immediate effect was an&#13;
increase of several million acre feet (maf) in canal seepage and a decrease&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
of over 2 maf in tubewell pumpage as cheaper canal water was substituted at&#13;
the margin for more expensive tubewell water in the winter or rabi season.&#13;
These changes necessarily imply significant positive recharge if the&#13;
aquifer was approximately in equilibrium before they occurred. As has been&#13;
shown, the long run response via increased private investment tends to&#13;
approximate equilibrium in the fresh groundwater areas, while increased&#13;
diversions can only worsen the drainage problem in the saline groundwater&#13;
areas. In short, the watertable should be in approximate equilibrium prior&#13;
to Tarbela, but the short run impact of the reservoir must be to induce&#13;
significant positive recharge. It follows from Table 6a that solutions&#13;
B2A2 and B3A2 are the most plausible overall representations of the state&#13;
of the aquifer.7/&#13;
Considering both production response and the state of the&#13;
aquifer, the tests clearly point to case B2A2--i.e., high canal losses,&#13;
medium efficiency for watercourse delivery and field application--as the&#13;
scenario with the best estimate of water loss parameters among those&#13;
considered. Thus, the water loss parameters of the B2A2 case are accepted&#13;
as specifying this aspect of the system in all subsequent discussion.&#13;
To summarize the discussion of validation, the method employed&#13;
was essentially to impose a rigorous consistency test on model solutions,&#13;
with consistency defined as conformity with the observed aspects of the&#13;
Indus Basin Irrigation System in a base period. Given the logical&#13;
consistency specified by model structure, the additional requirement of&#13;
empirical consistency with observations from many independent sources is a&#13;
7/ Solution BlA2 is not acceptable since it implies a slightly falling&#13;
water-table in Sind in contradiction of evidence for a rising&#13;
watertable in that province.&#13;

stringent test.   In fact, the severity of this test permitted estimation of&#13;
unobserved loss parameters when no other method of estimation was&#13;
available.&#13;
IV. An Application to Investment Project Evaluation&#13;
In this section, several variants of the Indus Basin Model are&#13;
solved to simulate the effects of a major investment, the Tarbela Dam, on&#13;
the agricultural production system of the Basin under different scenarios&#13;
with respect to system management and water allocation policy. Since the&#13;
introduction of a major reservoir, which will significantly augment the&#13;
capacity for intra-year transfer of water, will have a systemwide impact,&#13;
the evaluation of such an investment requires a framework that takes into&#13;
account all effects on the system; and this requirement imposes the need&#13;
for a systemwide modelling effort. Using several variants of the Indus&#13;
Basin Model, we shall show that the irrigation benefits from the Tarbela&#13;
investment are quite sensitive to water allocation policy and to system&#13;
management aiming at efficient conjunctive use of ground and surface&#13;
waters. The evaluation of the impact of Tarbela presented is confined to&#13;
its effects upon agricultural production and does not consider also the&#13;
substantial benefits derived through the generation of electricity,&#13;
although these are easily calculated from model solutions. However, the&#13;
joint optimization of irrigation and electric power benefits is an exercise&#13;
beyond the scope of this study.8/&#13;
8/ Instead, the model takes as given the actual constraints on irrigation&#13;
releases imposed by system managers to maintain power production at&#13;
acceptable levels, i.e., monthly upper and lower bounds on reservoir&#13;
storage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
A. Experimental Framework&#13;
A naive approach to the evaluation of Tarbela would be simply to&#13;
compare value-added in agriculture for a period of years before and after&#13;
the reservoir was in operation. This, of course, ascribes all exogenous&#13;
changes (either positive or negative) to the Project. In ex ante&#13;
evaluations, the project analyst is concerned with some form of comparison&#13;
between the "future without the project" and the "future with the project."&#13;
The analog for ex post evaluation is the "present without the project" and&#13;
the "present with the project." Whatever calculus is applied to the-&#13;
streams of benefits and costs, the two evaluations need not coincide even&#13;
though the project were to perform exactly up to expectations in physical&#13;
terms. The ex ante analysis must draw upon projected prices, while the ex&#13;
post analysis has access to realized prices.&#13;
Central to the evaluation of the impact of a reservoir like&#13;
Tarbela is that the benefits are not measured by the flow of irrigation&#13;
water it produces; the benefits depend upon how farmers transform the&#13;
increased water into production and employment. In the Indus Basin models,&#13;
the response function of farmers is specified in the farm level models for&#13;
each polygon. In the methodology of project appraisal, an explicit dis-&#13;
tinction is required between the prices to which the agents react and the&#13;
prices used as the numeraire for benefits and costs, as shown in Table 9.&#13;
Table 9&#13;
Prices and Project Effects&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
The "pure market price" evaluation corresponds to cell A of the&#13;
table, where the agents (farmers in the Indus case) are assumed to respond&#13;
to market prices, which are also used in transforming benefits and costs&#13;
from quantity into financial terms. Similarly, the pure border price"&#13;
evaluation is represented by cell C. An interesting case, in cell B, is&#13;
where the agents respond to market prices, but the resulting quantities are&#13;
valued at border prices in evaluating the impact of the project.     In the&#13;
table, the prices to which agents respond determine the response to the&#13;
project in physical terms -- e.g. the number of units of wheat produced.&#13;
Prices used in the evaluation of benefits and costs, in turn, apply to&#13;
those physical quantities.   In the usual practice of project evaluation, no&#13;
response function to the agents is permitted, and the difference between a&#13;
border price and a market price evaluation is entirely in the price domain,&#13;
the quantities remaining unchanged. This may be appropriate for some&#13;
classes of projects. By contrast, in our procedure changes in benefits and&#13;
costs occur in both the price and the quantity domains (i.e., cell C) and&#13;
the producer reponse to different prices is significant.&#13;
The second conceptual issue relevant here is the distinction&#13;
between the short-run and the long-run impact of the project. In the&#13;
context of this study, we define the short-run impact to be the farmers'&#13;
response to the public investment based upon the existing stocks of&#13;
farmers' investment in tractors and tubewells and implicitly subject to any&#13;
constraints on access to chemical fertilizer existing during the&#13;
calibration year for cropping activities, 1976-77.9/ The long-run impact&#13;
9/ Government of Pakistan data on chemical fertilizer consumption&#13;
subsequent to 1976-77 show large increases, suggesting that access to&#13;
fertilizer was constrained during the 1976-77 crop cycles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
is measured by permitting these stocks to be augmented by investment&#13;
activities for private tubewells and tractors and embedding fertilizer&#13;
response curves in the cropping activity sets.&#13;
The third issue has to do with hydrological balance, or&#13;
equilibrium, in the aquifer. If the system is operated out of&#13;
equilibrium, short-term production gains can be realized relative to the&#13;
equilibrium positions. These are at the cost of production losses or&#13;
investment expenditures in later years. For example, water can be&#13;
diverted to saline areas for some years in volumes which lead to a&#13;
sustained rise in the water table. During these years, higher levels of&#13;
production are obtainable than if the flows were restricted to those&#13;
consistent with a stabilized water table. Ultimately, of course, yields&#13;
start to decline as the water table rises to critical levels, and&#13;
eventually land goes out of production. This is not the full story. The&#13;
water table can be controlled by drainage, as well as by the volume of&#13;
water diverted. However, there is a cost attached to drainage, so that&#13;
imposing equilibrium implies short-term benefits lower than those&#13;
associated with disequilibrium.&#13;
This poses the issue, then, of whether the impact of Tarbela&#13;
upon the aquifer in the Basin is stabilizing or destabilizing.LO/ If it&#13;
is the former, then evaluating only production increases will underestimate&#13;
the benefits of the dam and, if the latter, it will overestimate them. In&#13;
this connection, it is of interest to note that the Indus Special Study of&#13;
1968 anticipated that some mining of the aquifer would occur prior to the&#13;
10/ By stabilization, we mean tending toward static equilibrium in aquifer&#13;
storage - i.e., groundwater level is static.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
availability of Tarbela storage and also suggested that the introduction of&#13;
the Tarbela Reservoir would result in a stabilization of the water table in&#13;
the Punjab.&#13;
Lastly, the benefits from the reservoir depend not only upon the&#13;
volume of additional water made available and how farmers respond to&#13;
incremental water per unit, but upon how the water is allocated spatially&#13;
and over months. In this analysis, we distinguish between the impact of&#13;
Tarbela with canel water diversions set at the mean level observed over&#13;
five years of operation, 1975-80, and the impact of Tarbela given that&#13;
water is allocated efficiently among polygons and over months subject to&#13;
pre-existing water rights. In evaluating the latter impact, the observed&#13;
mean diversions over the period 1967-75 were imposed as lower bounds, i.e.,&#13;
proxies for historic water rights, and the model was free to allocate all&#13;
water in excess of these bounds, including that made available by Tarbela&#13;
storage capacity.&#13;
These various considerations are brought together in Table 10,&#13;
which defines the experiments reported upon in the next section. Experi-&#13;
ments A, B, C, D, E, and F were all conducted by solving the polygon models&#13;
piecemeal, with exogenous water allocations corresponding to the average&#13;
pre-Tarbela allocation for experiments A, C, and E and corresponding to the&#13;
average post-Tarbela allocation for experiments B, D and F. The ground-&#13;
water balance constraint was not imposed on experiments A, C, B and D, but&#13;
was for experiments E, F, G and H.&#13;

As noted earlier, the groundwater balance constaint is not recog-&#13;
nized by the individual farmer as a constraint on his activities. The&#13;
depth to the watertable is a datum for him. However, the depth to water-&#13;
table is a target variable for the government. Thus, the formulation of&#13;
these model variants explicitly incorporates a two-level programming&#13;
problem. As noted in section II, the method by which the two level problem&#13;
is solved in the Indus Basin models is to introduce control variables that&#13;
induce farmers to behave as though they obeyed the groundwater balance&#13;
constraint. Since the depth to watertable target variables, as well as the&#13;
polygonal water allocation variables (in experiments E and F), are fixed&#13;
exogenously in these experiments, a set of instrument variables is required&#13;
to assure feasibility. It turns out that these instrument variables can be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
regarded as the government's control instrument, given a government policy&#13;
of stabilizing the aquifer at a socially desirable level. More&#13;
specifically, activities that withdraw water via irrigation and drainage&#13;
wells are required to keep the watertable from rising above the prescribed&#13;
level; while in model variants with exogenously fixed polygonal allocations&#13;
of surface water, an activity that injects water is also necessary to&#13;
assure feasibility in saline polygons.&#13;
Since only private tubewells are available in sufficient numbers&#13;
and have a sufficiently dispersed spatial distribution to constitute an&#13;
effective control instrument, private tubewells are the intermediate policy&#13;
instrument for fresh groundwater polygons. Note that with tubewell&#13;
investment activities included in each model variant of this set, tubewell&#13;
capacity is unbounded; and hence the private tubewell is a sufficient&#13;
intermediate control instrument. As shown in the Appendix, given a&#13;
groundwater balance constraint, the shadow price (i.e., dual variable) for&#13;
the groundwater balance constraint is interpreted as the tax or subsidy&#13;
that will induce farmers to pump exactly the quantity of water required to&#13;
meet the constraint. Hence, implementation of the watertable targets in&#13;
fresh water polygons requires polygon-specific taxes or subsidies on&#13;
private tubewell pumping as the direct control instruments for inducing the&#13;
desired levels of the intermediate instrument, actual tubewell pumping.&#13;
In the saline groundwater polygons, other instruments are&#13;
needed. In these areas, government operated drainage wells (for&#13;
withdrawals) and injection wells (for additions) are sufficient to assure&#13;
stabilization of the watertable at the desired level. The operating and&#13;
annualized capital costs of these drainage and injection wells are entered&#13;
as negative items in the polygonal objective function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
The short-run impact of the project can be measured by the&#13;
difference in outcomes (B-A), where there is no complementary private&#13;
investment in either case. The usual measure of benefits ex post, the&#13;
difference between the present with the project and the present without the&#13;
project is the difference (D-C), which allows for complementary private&#13;
investments.&#13;
Solution C measures an outcome which is not sustainable in the&#13;
future ceteris paribus because groundwater balance is not imposed. The&#13;
difference in outcome between E (where the groundwater balance is imposed)&#13;
and C, or (E-C), is a measure of the cost of imposing equilibrium.11/&#13;
This applies in the absence of Tarbela. With Tarbela water available, the&#13;
cost of equilibrium is the difference (F-D). The contribution of Tarbela&#13;
to reducing the cost of attaining equilibrium is then (F-D) - (E-C) which&#13;
will be positive if Tarbela tends to be equilibrating and negative if it is&#13;
disequilibrating.&#13;
At this stage, then, we have three measures of the benefits from&#13;
the reservoir. The first, (B-A), is the short run difference without&#13;
complementary private investments. The second, (D-C), is the difference in&#13;
outcomes between present with and without the project -- i.e., including&#13;
complementary investments. The third measure incorporates an estimate also&#13;
of the equilibrating impact of the project, which may be positive or&#13;
negative. This measure is (D-C) + (F-D) - (E-C) = (F-E). Solution F&#13;
corresponds to the post-Tarbela outcome with groundwater balance imposed,&#13;
11/  The measure adopted here is the loss of value-added in moving from a&#13;
disequilibrium situation (C) to an equilibrium one (E). An&#13;
alternative measure, not available from this study, is the&#13;
(discounted) stream of lost production associated in the future with&#13;
the disequilibrium strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
and solution E to the corresponding pre-Tarbela outcome. From this&#13;
identity, the obvious conclusion emerges that it is legitimate to measure&#13;
the project's benefits solely in terms of increase in value added if the&#13;
system were in equilibrium before the project and remained so after it was&#13;
in operation. This is a strong assumption indeed. If it does not hold,&#13;
then the contribution of the reservoir to stabilizing or destabilizing the&#13;
aquifer should be added to the increase in value added.&#13;
The addition of the reservoir and the imposition of operating&#13;
rules which require the system to be run in equilibrium may be regarded as&#13;
a package. The impact of the package is measured in terms of the&#13;
difference (F-C) = (F-E) + (E-C), where the first term on the RHS, (F-E),&#13;
is the increase in value added plus the contribution (positive or negative)&#13;
of the reservoir towards stabilization and the second term, (E-C), is the&#13;
change due to shifting to an equilibrium position from a disequilibrium one&#13;
in the absence of the reservoir.&#13;
All the above quantities in this ex post evaluation were based on&#13;
observed patterns of releases from the reservoir and their allocations&#13;
among polygons. The observed pattern need not be an optimal one. The&#13;
effect obtained by moving from the observed pattern to the optimal one is&#13;
given by the differences (G-E) for the without Tarbela scenario and (H-F)&#13;
for the with Tarbela scenario, where the solutions G and H correspond to&#13;
optimal allocation subject to constraints that force monthly polygonal&#13;
allocations to be not less than the average pre-Tarbela allocation. The&#13;
difference (H-G) is then the potential impact of Tarbela given groundwater&#13;
balance and an optimal allocation subject to historic water rights. An&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
estimate of the maximum irrigation impact is given by (H-C) = (H-G) + (G-E)&#13;
+ (E-C) where (H-G) is the increase in benefits due to Tarbela, given&#13;
optimization and GWB and (G-E) + (E-C) are the impact of the package of&#13;
optimization and the imposition of equilibrium.&#13;
There remains the question of which magnitude(s) are to be used&#13;
in assessing benefits. The logic of the model formulation (in those&#13;
solutions incorporating groundwater balance) leads to using the value of&#13;
the objective function as the index of social welfare achieved. However,&#13;
this implies measurement of benefits in subjective units (i.e., utils) and&#13;
these are often difficult for policymakers to interpret. Moreover,&#13;
comparison of the several measures of project benefits using both utils and&#13;
rupees of value added as numeraire for social welfare showed that the&#13;
results were the same in terms of rankings and order of magnitude.&#13;
Therefore, benefit estimates will be presented using the intuitively&#13;
clearer numeraire of rupees of value added.&#13;
Note also that value added at border prices is a close approxi-&#13;
mation to the economic return to Tarbela since all outputs are effectively&#13;
tradeable and the only non-traded input that affects the calculation of&#13;
value added is the non-traded component of private tubewell investments,&#13;
which is quite small relative to the magnitude of value added. Of course,&#13;
agricultural value added accrues as income to farmers and landlord house-&#13;
holds, and social cost-benefit analysis will value these incomes, parti-&#13;
tioned into consumption and savings, by some system of weights. However,&#13;
the same set of weights would be applied to each of the different benefit&#13;
estimates; and in the absence of a disaggregation by income class of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
distribution of value added, the ordering and relative magnitudes of the&#13;
several benefit measures would be unchanged by the application of the&#13;
system of weights.&#13;
B. Results from Simulation Experiments at Domestic Prices&#13;
In these experiments, farmgate prices are domestic prices,&#13;
although agricultural value-added is evaluated at both domestic and border&#13;
prices. Thus, they correspond to the evaluations in cells A and B of Table&#13;
9. All of the eight experiments listed in Table 10, A through H, were&#13;
performed. Table 11 presents the resulting numerical values for the&#13;
critical differences discussed in the preceding decomposition analysis.&#13;
Thus, the short run impact of the project (B-A) is about 1.1 billion&#13;
rupees, whether valued at domestic or border prices. The direct long run&#13;
effect of Tarbela, i.e., present with minus present without the reservoir&#13;
(D-C) is about 0.9 billion rupees at either domestic or border prices. The&#13;
explanation of the lower benefit in the longer run is that total water use&#13;
is higher given time for accumulation of complementary private investment,&#13;
i.e., 70-72 million acre feet (MAF) as compared with 64-66 MAF in the short&#13;
run solutions. Thus, diminishing returns to water lower the productivity&#13;
of the additional water gained via Tarbela in the longer run solutions.&#13;
However, as was shown above, the long run solution (D-C) is not a&#13;
valid measure of the benefits from the reservoir unless the aquifer is in&#13;
steady state. Results from the model solutions show that the solution to&#13;
experiment D shows positive recharge of 1.3 MAF for the basin as a whole,&#13;
with Punjab accounting for 0.3 MAF and Sind, 0.8 MAF. These results&#13;
suggest a slowly rising watertable that would not present immediate&#13;
problems, except perhaps in Sind. However, these aggregate statistics&#13;

conceal divergent trends. When the groundwater balance for Punjab is&#13;
decomposed into balances for fresh and saline groundwater areas, net&#13;
recharge is -1.3 MAF in the fresh groundwater areas and 1.6 MAF in the&#13;
saline areas. Unfortunately, the problems of a falling watertable in the&#13;
fresh groundwater areas and of a rising one in the saline groundwater areas&#13;
have local effects that do not offset. On the contrary, they require&#13;
policies which work to reduce tubewell withdrawals in the fresh groundwater&#13;
areas and provide drainage in the saline areas.&#13;
The imposition of groundwater balance is a shock to the system.&#13;
Water demand (at the root zone) decreases by 6.6 MAF given a present&#13;
without project scenario (E-C) and by 1.5 MAF in the present with project&#13;
scenario (F-D). The effect on value-added is a reduction of 1.9 to 2.9&#13;
billion rupees in the without project case and 1.3 to 1.6 billion rupees in&#13;
the with project case. These are quantitative measures of the extent to&#13;
which current agricultural production has been borrowing from future&#13;
agricultural production via mining of the aquifer or waterlogging where&#13;
rises in the watertable have been excessive. The decrease is less in the&#13;
Post-Tarbela case since tubewells supply less water and negative recharge&#13;
is less in fresh groundwater areas. The difference, (F-D) - (E-C), is&#13;
positive, 0.6 to 1.3 billion rupees. Hence, the effect of Tarbela on the&#13;
aquifer was stabilizing, and the total effect of Tarbela (F-E) is 1.5&#13;
and 2.2 billion rupees at domestic and border prices respectively.&#13;
Of course, no matter how necessary the imposition of groundwater&#13;
balance may become, the shift to steady state water use has a depressing&#13;
effect on value-added and farm incomes. Even the combination of Tarbela&#13;
reservoir and groundwater balance has a negative effect, i.e., the&#13;
difference F-C is -0.4 and -0.8 billion rupees in domestic and border&#13;
prices respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
In startling contrast, the experiments in which water allocation&#13;
is endogenous, subject to groundwater balance and historic water rights&#13;
constraints, indicate massive benefits from a more efficient allocation.&#13;
In the without Tarbela case, the gains from optimization, i.e., difference&#13;
G-E, are 7.2 and 9.4 billion rupees at domestic and border prices&#13;
respectively. In the with reservoir case, i.e., difference H-F, the&#13;
benefits are 7.3 and 9.0 billion rupees at domestic and border prices&#13;
respectively. Given that imposition of groundwater balance will be&#13;
necessary in the future, the policy of combining groundwater balance with&#13;
optimization of water allocation appears attractive. For example, the&#13;
potential irrigation impact of the package of Tarbela, optimization and&#13;
groundwater balance (i.e., H-C) is 6.9 billion rupees at domestic prices&#13;
and 8.3 billion rupees at border prices. Thus, combining imposition of&#13;
groundwater balance with optimization avoids the necessity of a reduction&#13;
in farm incomes and employment. Of course, it is possible that the gains&#13;
in agricultural output that the model achieves with optimization may prove&#13;
more elusive in practice--i.e., there may exist political, institutional or&#13;
environmental constraints that have been neglected. However, the magnitude&#13;
of the prospective benefits is sufficiently large to justify an intensive&#13;
effort to implement the efficiency gains the optimizing solutions G and H&#13;
suggest are attainable.&#13;
C. Results from Simulation Experiments at Border Prices&#13;
These experiments repeat seven of the eight experiments of Table&#13;
10 A through F and H, with one fundamental change -- farmgate prices are&#13;
border prices. Thus, each experiment corresponds to the evaluation in cell&#13;
C of Table 9. The numerical values for the critical differences discussed&#13;
above are presented in Table 12:&#13;

In these experiments, both the short run impact of the project&#13;
A A                                   A A&#13;
(B-A) and the direct long run effect (D-C) yield benefits of about one&#13;
billion rupees. The tendency toward diminishing returns to water in the&#13;
long run solution with its greater water input is much attenuated as&#13;
compared with the experiments at domestic prices. This is clearly due to&#13;
prices which induce resource allocation decisions that reflect the&#13;
country's comparative advantage. A noteworthy difference between these&#13;
experiments and those at domestic prices is that the higher value-added at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
border prices induces an investment boom in tractors and tubewells that&#13;
leads to significantly greater tubewell pumping and crop water use -- in&#13;
the present with project case (experiment D), investments are 70,000&#13;
tractors (225 percent increase in stock) and 114,000 private tubewells (85&#13;
percent increase in stock). With tubewell pumping exceeding 50 MAF, there&#13;
is a sharply falling water table in Punjab and virtual equilibrium in Sind.&#13;
The obvious need for imposition of groundwater balance is met in&#13;
the solutions E and F, which produce the usual shock to the system -- water&#13;
demand at the root zone decreases by 13 MAF in the present without project&#13;
scenario (difference E-C) and by 9 MAF in the present with project scenario&#13;
(F-D). The effects on value-added are reductions of 4.7 and 3.6 billion&#13;
rupees in the without and with project scenarios respectively. Thus, the&#13;
difference (F-D) - (E-C) is positive and Tarbela has a stabilizing effect&#13;
on the aquifer in these experiments also. The total effect of Tarbela&#13;
(F-E) is 2.2 billion rupees. As before, the combination of Tarbela and&#13;
groundwater balance (difference F-C) has a negative effect on value-added.&#13;
The effect of optimization subject to historic water rights (H-F) on&#13;
agricultural production and resource use is just as pronounced at border&#13;
prices -- value-added increases by 10.1 billion rupees, cropping intensity&#13;
increases by 23 percent, canal diversion by 26.3 MAF and crop water use at&#13;
the root zone by 22.5 MAF. Of course, with gains of this magnitude from&#13;
optimization, the package of Tarbela, groundwater balance and optimization&#13;
(H-C) shows an increase of 7.6 billion rupees, or 21 percent, in&#13;
agricultural value added.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
The differences in value of output and level of private invest-&#13;
ment derive directly from the substitution of world prices for distorted&#13;
domestic prices. In the present with project case, the substitution&#13;
increases agricultural value added (measured initially at domestic prices)&#13;
by 27 percent and reduces agricultural employment by 0.4 percent. If the&#13;
change in output is valued at economic prices initially as well as&#13;
terminally, the increase is 12 percent. The stability in employment&#13;
results largely from the opposed effects of increases in both cropping&#13;
intensity and farm mechanization. The substitution of border for domestic&#13;
prices doubles the price of rice and halves the price of sugarcane. In&#13;
simple consequence, cropping patterns shift toward rice and away from&#13;
sugarcane in the experiments at border prices. Of course, elimination of&#13;
the price wedges boosts farm income and provides substantially increased&#13;
incentives for private investment. However, the reason for the signifi-&#13;
cantly increased crop water use is less obvious. The dominant source of&#13;
the increased crop water use is tubewell pumping. How can the greatly&#13;
increased tubewell pumping occur between optimization experiments with&#13;
groundwater balance? The answer is that under the conditions of the quite&#13;
flat Indus Plains with poor natural drainage, much of the excess of the&#13;
water applied to a rice crop about actual crop consumptive requirements&#13;
seeps to the aquifer and is available for subsequent crop use if the&#13;
groundwater is fresh. Thus, the large increase in rice acreage under&#13;
border prices significantly increases net recharge, permitting significant&#13;
increase in tubewell pumping. The large increase in rice production at&#13;
border prices which accounts for much of the total output increase means&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
that the revenue losses to the government from implicit taxation at the&#13;
distorted domestic prices (3.3 billion rupees) are significantly less than&#13;
the increase in agricultural value added of 7.86 billion rupees (i.e.,&#13;
change in value added in D-D comparison).&#13;
It should be noted that not all of the changes associated with&#13;
the substitution of border prices are necessarily socially desirable. For&#13;
example, in the experimental comparison, (H-H), farm employment drops by&#13;
0.5 billion man-hours. Whether or not the increased mechanization implied&#13;
by the high tractor investments under border prices is socially optimal&#13;
depends on supply and demand conditions for rural labor. Given the large&#13;
increases in employment generated by the optimization experiments, and the&#13;
migration of Pakistani labor to the middle east in recent years, it is not&#13;
obvious whether labor surplus or shortage would occur under the&#13;
hypothesized conditions.&#13;
V. An Application To Investment Program Evaluation&#13;
A major objective of the research that led to the Indus family of&#13;
models was the development of methods of integrating the interdependence&#13;
between private agricultural production and investment decisions, surface&#13;
water distribution and groundwater supply into investment planning mdels&#13;
for irrigated agriculture. In this section, the Revised Action Programme&#13;
(RAP) of WAPDA is evaluated at a 1995 planning horizon. In accord with&#13;
standard investment appraisal methodology, the RAP investments are&#13;
evaluated by considering the irrigated agriculture of the basin without and&#13;
with the investment in question in the environment that will exist when the&#13;
investment would be in place. Since many of the investments to be&#13;
evaluated are either complementary with or substitutes for each other, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
specification of the appropriate environment for a given investment can&#13;
become complex. In this section, we first describe the specification of&#13;
the projected environment at the 1995 horizon, and then characterize the&#13;
RAP investments, provide a general review of the results from the RAP&#13;
evaluation experiments, analyze the productivity of the RAP investments and&#13;
finish with a summary.&#13;
A. The 1995 Investment Environment&#13;
Given the problem of projecting the investment environment as it&#13;
is expected to exist at some future date, the first step is to identify the&#13;
predictable sources of exogenous change that may impinge upon the system of&#13;
irrigated agriculture in the Indus Basin. These are prices, technology,&#13;
labor force and population. The endogenous response to these changes --&#13;
e.g., farm labor employment, cropping patterns, private investment -- is&#13;
obtained from the solution to simulation experiments. Of course, another&#13;
source of change is government investments and the object of the whole&#13;
exercise is to simulate the endogenous response to such changes. It is&#13;
assumed that the external physical environment -- e.g., median rim station&#13;
inflows -- remains constant, as do the political and economic institutions&#13;
of the country.&#13;
While price projections are notoriously fallible, every act of&#13;
investment necessarily involves implicit projection of at least a range of&#13;
prices that sustain the profitability of the investment. For this reason,&#13;
the World Bank regularly provides long range projects of world prices for&#13;
major commodities by a staff of experienced commodity analysts. The&#13;
commodity projects of this group (prepared in 1981) were used in projecting&#13;
farm gate prices. Note that these are border prices and imply that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
Government of Pakistan will not intervene in these markets with policies&#13;
that cause domestic prices to diverge from the border prices.&#13;
Projection of future agricultural technology in the Indus Basin&#13;
is in a certain sense simpler in that existing technology lags&#13;
significantly behind production possibilities in other countries with&#13;
similar resource endowment -- e.g, Egypt. Thus, a projection of future&#13;
technology is essentially a forecast of the rate at which Pakistan catches&#13;
up. However, the rate at which better technology is introduced is&#13;
dependent on the policies and investments of the Government of Pakistan in&#13;
the future-e.g., investments in adaptive agricultural research and&#13;
extension, improvements in the efficiency of the managers of the surface&#13;
water distribution system. In order to make the projection of agricultural&#13;
technology as nearly consistent as possible with the assumptions and&#13;
projections of the RAP, the estimates of future input-output relationships&#13;
for major crops that were used in preparing the RAP were also used in&#13;
specifying the technology for 1995. These estimates assume a significant&#13;
increase in adaptive agricultural research and extension activities by the&#13;

the Punjab Cotton-Wheat agroclimatic zone--similar increases were projected&#13;
in other agroclimatic zones.&#13;
Projections of population and labor force are the domain of&#13;
demographers, and the projection of these magnitudes to the 1995 horizon&#13;
utilizes the estimates from a recent demographic study of Pakistan.12/&#13;
However, even the demographic projections are not published with the degree&#13;
of disaggregation required for the Indus models. Therefore, the following&#13;
assumptions were employed in disaggregating the demographic projections:&#13;
i.    Per cent change in farm population is the same as percent&#13;
change in rural population.&#13;
ii.   Farm labor force remains the same proportion of farm&#13;
population as in base period.&#13;
iii. Each polygon has the same rate of population change.&#13;
iv.   Age and sex distribution of the rural population is the same&#13;
as in base period.&#13;
The particular population projection selected as most likely and utilized&#13;
for the 1995 parameter estimates assumes slow fertility decline in&#13;
Pakistan.l3/ From a base of 49.15 million rural population in mid-1972,&#13;
this projection reaches 87.6 million in mid-1995 for an increase of 78.2&#13;
per cent, or 2.54% per year. While the resulting disaggregated labor force&#13;
estimates are somewhat crude, significant refinement would require a&#13;
full-scale labor market analysis to generate the requisite migration&#13;
estimates. This seemed a heavy price for a marginal improvement of a&#13;
water-oriented model.&#13;

B. A Description of the Revised Action Programme Investments&#13;
The Revised Action Programme (RAP) of WAPDA updates and extends&#13;
an Action Programme for investments in irrigated agriculture and&#13;
hydroelectricity formulated in the 1960s. It envisions an investment of&#13;
some 68 billion rupees (in 1978 prices) over the ten-year period from 1980&#13;
to 1990. Table 14 presents a disaggregation of the investment allocation&#13;
by major category. Note that almost one-half of the projected expenditures&#13;
(47%) are either for government nonwater-related investments or supply&#13;
credit for private investments. Another 9 percent is for flood control&#13;
investments. The simulation experiments of this chapter will not evaluate&#13;
investments in these categories.14/ The remaining investments will be&#13;
evaluated in the subsequent analysis, although the treatment of drainage&#13;
investments will be somewhat indirect. That is, given the premise that&#13;
Pakistan wishes to maintain in perpetuity the productivity of the land and&#13;
water resources of the basin, the evaluation experiments all specify&#13;
groundwater equilibrium. In consequence, the requisite amounts of drainage&#13;
are determined from the solutions to the experiments. The other&#13;
water-related public investments--reservoirs, irrigated area extension,&#13;
canal remodelling and watercourse renovation/improvement will be evaluated&#13;
watercourse renovation/improvement will be evaluated directly through&#13;
experiments in which the model's structure and/or parameters are changed to&#13;
characterize the physical impact of these investments. The sets of&#13;
discrete investments that comprise the RAP recommendations in these four&#13;
categories are briefly described in Table 15.&#13;
14/ While it would be possible to estimate benefits from these&#13;
miscellaneous investments using the Indus models, the exercise would&#13;
necessarily involve many ad hoc assumptions and would be out of place&#13;
in this paper.&#13;

C. General Review of Results from RAP Evaluation Experiments&#13;
It is helpful to place the RAP evaluation experiments in&#13;
perspective prior to examining the evidence from the several measures of&#13;
investment return. This means in the first instance determining the effect&#13;
on significant variables of the projected environment at the 1995 horizon.&#13;
This is done by comparing values from a solution that closely reflects the&#13;
actual current values for these variables, the solution with post-Tarbela&#13;
surface water allocation, endogenous private investment, and without&#13;
groundwater balance constraint (solution D of section IV). Such a&#13;
comparison of key endogenous variables is given in Table 16. Note that&#13;
agricultural production (i.e., value-added) increases by 123 percent and&#13;
farm income per family member by 34 percent in the 1995 projection over the&#13;
simulation estimate of current values (in domestic prices of 1977 rupees).&#13;
However, when the base of comparison is a solution based on substitution of&#13;
border prices for domestic prices, the increases are only 67 and 9 percent&#13;

for agricultural production and farm income per head respectively. In&#13;
other words, more than one half of the increases are due to elimination of&#13;
the income depressing effects of distorted domestic prices. The remainder&#13;
is due to the combination of optimization with groundwater balance and the&#13;
improvement in agricultural technology assumed in the 1995 model parameters&#13;
and which presupposes significant investment by the Government of Pakistan&#13;
over the intervening years in adaptive agricultural research and in&#13;
expansion and improvement of agricultural extension services. An even&#13;
larger proportion of the increases in stocks of private tubewells and&#13;
tractors (75 to 85 percent) is due to substitution of prices reflecting&#13;
social opportunity costs. On the other hand, all of the increase in labor&#13;
input and most of the increases in land and fertilizer inputs are due to&#13;
optimization cum groundwater balance and the improved technology of 1995.&#13;
A similar comparison for water demand and supply at the root zone is given&#13;
in Table 17. These data show that over one half of the increase in water&#13;
demand is due to use of prices that reflect social opportunity costs and&#13;
that most of the corresponding increase in water supply comes from&#13;
increased private tubewell pumping.&#13;
Also important is an understanding of the physical effects of the&#13;
RAP investments including an estimate of their relative magnitude. The&#13;
essential irrigation function of the reservoir investments (A) is the&#13;
interseasonal transfer of surface water. The difference in seasonal canal&#13;
diversions between the base case and investment package A simulation&#13;
experiments provides a quantitative measure of the impact of the&#13;
reservoirs, with rabi diversions increasing by 13 MAF or 36.4 percent,&#13;
kharif diversions decreasing by 1.8 MAF or 2.3 percent, and total&#13;

diversions increasing by 11.2 MAF or 9.8 percent. The irrigated area&#13;
extension investments (B) result in an additional 4.5 million irrigated&#13;
acres or 15.6 percent. The farm population on the newly-irrigated acres is&#13;
6.3 million persons, for an increase of 16.3 percent of the farm population&#13;
on irrigated land. The canal capacity investments (C) permit larger&#13;
diversions through selected canals. The differences in maximal flows&#13;
(defined as monthly flows at or above the old capacity level) and total&#13;
diversions of these canals between the base case and investment package C&#13;
experiments is 4.4 MAF or 45.4 percent on maximal flows and 4.2 MAF or 18.5&#13;
percent on annual diversions. The watercourse renovation/improvement&#13;
investments (D) reduce seepage losses in water transmission by 55 and 43&#13;
percent on watercourses in saline and fresh groundwater areas&#13;
respectively. The difference in such losses between the base case and&#13;
investment package D experiments is 8 MAF or 50 percent.&#13;
The drainage requirements associated with the other&#13;
water-related RAP investments are substantial and of two kinds: (i)&#13;
drainage well pumping and disposal in saline groundwater areas, and (ii)&#13;
tubewell pumping controlled by the government via a tax or subsidy on&#13;
pumping in fresh groundwater areas.15/ The additional drainage&#13;
requirements of both types for the several investment packages are obtained&#13;
by taking the difference between the drainage requirements of the base case&#13;
and the investment package experiments, and these are given in Table 18.&#13;
15/ In practice much primary drainage is accomplished by surface drainage&#13;
investments. For simplicity, all primary drainage investments are&#13;
assumed to be sub-surface. On the average, there do not seem to be&#13;
large differences in cost between the two types of investment in&#13;
Pakistan (excluding tile drainage).&#13;

As might be expected, only investment packages with watercourse improvement&#13;
investments included show a decrease in either type of drainage&#13;
requirement. Packages with investments A and C but without D show large&#13;
drainage requirements.&#13;
One final feature of the solutions to the RAP evaluation&#13;
experiments must be noted. The base case combination of efficiency prices&#13;
and improved agricultural technology induces a demand for canal water that&#13;
increases annual canal diversions to 115 million acre-feet. This is&#13;
approximately the level of diversions achieved in the system management&#13;
experiments of section VI, and is conceded by knowledgable observers to be&#13;
feasible. However, the addition of the RAP investments increases the&#13;
demand for canal water to the maximum in a number of experiments--i.e., the&#13;
surplus water vented to the Arabian Sea is driven to zero. The&#13;
experimental results on annual canal diversions and vent to the sea is&#13;
given in Table 19. It must be conceded that such a high level of&#13;
diversions may not be achieveable in practice. A positive level of vent to&#13;
the sea may be necessary to maintain the ecology of the Indus estuary. Of&#13;
much greater import is the implication that with the RAP investments,&#13;
Pakistan will have reached the limits of its natural water endowment. In&#13;
this respect, it should be recalled that the RAP experiments included a&#13;
groundwater balance constraint. This implies that sustainable tubewell&#13;
pumping is also at a maximum in a number of the experiments. Thus, the&#13;
model accounts for all sources of water available to Pakistan, and they are&#13;
used efficiently and maximally in some of the experiments. Future gains in&#13;
agricultural production beyond the RAP investments will have to come from&#13;
better technology that increases the marginal product of water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-&#13;
D. An Analysis of the Productivity of the RAP Investments&#13;
Two measures of investment productivity will be considered: net&#13;
benefit and comparative statical internal rate of return (CSIRR), where net&#13;
benefit in defined as discounted benefits less discounted costs and CSIRR&#13;
is defined as that rate of discount which equates annualized costs with&#13;
annualized benefits.   If the sectoral allocation of investible resources to&#13;
water-cum-power investments is fixed independently of prospective returns&#13;
to such investments, then maximization of the net benefit from the given&#13;
volume of investment will produce the most productive program. On the&#13;
other hand, if the sectoral allocation of investment is not fixed but&#13;
depends on the productivity of the available investment alternatives, then&#13;
measures of relative productivity, such as internal rates of return, are&#13;
better criteria for selection of an investment program.&#13;
The Net Benefit Criterion&#13;
Net benefits for the fifteen possible investment packages of the&#13;
component investment sets, A, B, C and D, are presented in Table 20 on the&#13;
basis of a 10 percent discount rate. Note that net benefits are computed&#13;
three ways for each package: without drainage costs or power benefits,&#13;
with drainage costs but without power benefits, and with drainage costs and&#13;
power benefits. The calculations for net benefit without any power benefit&#13;
takes account of all investment costs and hence measures investment&#13;
productivity on the premise that power benefits are zero. When the&#13;
calculation also neglects the associated drainage costs, the resulting net&#13;
benefit while the most restricted and myopic of the four turns out to be&#13;
useful for analytical purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66-&#13;
Given the criterion of maximization of net benefit from a fixed&#13;
allocation of resources to sectoral investment, all of the formulations of&#13;
net benefits yield the same investment programs. Depending on the size of&#13;
the fixed investment allocation, the optimal choice is A alone, A and B, or&#13;
A, B and D. Note that the combination of A, B and C is dominated by the&#13;
combination A and B. That is, A and B would be preferred to A, B and C&#13;
absolutely if the objective is productivity since A and B yield a higher&#13;
net benefit and the total investment is less. In the same way, A, B and D&#13;
dominate A, B, C and D. In other words, the full four component investment&#13;
program is not efficient. If investment components A and B are undertaken,&#13;
then the canal remodelling investments as a group should not be undertaken&#13;
(although this does not preclude the possibility that any individual canal&#13;
remodelling investment may be highly productive). If the fixed allocation&#13;
is too small to finance A, then B alone is preferred. Similarly, if B&#13;
alone cannot be financed, then D alone is preferred to C (except when&#13;
drainage costs are neglected). While these rankings are in principle&#13;
dependent on the discount rate used, they are not changed at other rates&#13;
except that A, B and D no longer dominates A, B, C and D when the discount&#13;
rate becomes much smaller.&#13;
The Comparative Statical Internal Rate of Return Criterion&#13;
Comparative statical internal rates of return (CSIRR) for the&#13;
basic investment packages are shown in Table 21 for each of the three&#13;
formulations of net benefit. Unlike the net benefit, the CSIRR is measure&#13;
of relative investment productivity that is not dependent on a prior&#13;
selection of a discount rate. Rather, the useyis free to apply the capital&#13;
cost that is appropriate in determining whether or not a particular&#13;

investment should be undertaken. The CSIRRs show very much higher&#13;
productivity for packages including reservoir power benefits and superior&#13;
productivity for irrigated area extension investments when power benefits&#13;
are neglected. Other important results are: (i) package A and B is&#13;
preferred to other two investment packages if power benefits are included;&#13;
(ii) package B and D is preferred to other two investment packages when&#13;
power benefits are excluded; (iii) package A, B and D is preferred to&#13;
other three investment packages when power benefits are included and (iv)&#13;
package B, C and D is preferred to other three investment packages when&#13;
power benefits are excluded.&#13;
E. Complementarity - Substitution Effects Between Investments&#13;
Examination of the net benefits from various investment packages&#13;
shown in Table 20 indicates a number of cases of interaction effects&#13;
between investments -- e.g., the net benefit of B and D together (2,226&#13;
million rupees) is significantly greater than the sum of the net benefits&#13;
from these investments taken separately (1,472 and 475 million rupees for B&#13;
and D respectively). Given the interdependence that exists in the&#13;
hydrology of the basin as well as the economic interdependence among&#13;
regions sharing a common, scarce water resource, the existence of&#13;
complementarity and substitution relations among different investments is&#13;
to be expected but empirical evidence of such interactions is rare.&#13;
Fortunately, the results from the RAP simulation experiments can be used to&#13;
derive empirical estimates of complementarity-substitution relations among&#13;
the several investment types of the RAP program. The method for deriving&#13;
such estimates measures the deviation of net benefit for an investment&#13;
package from the sum of the net benefits from its component investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-69-&#13;
taken separately. However, before considering the estimates, it will be&#13;
useful to examine a priori expectations as to the nature of these&#13;
interactions for the simplest type of case, two investments. In order to&#13;
isolate pure interaction effects between two investments, the calculation&#13;
should exclude drainage costs and power benefits. Subsequently, measures&#13;
of the interaction between drainage and other investments will be derived.&#13;
The qualitative effects of the four investment types can be described as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Investment Type                        Nature of Its Impact on the System&#13;
A - Reservoirs                       Supplies more water in dry season.&#13;
B - Irrigated Area Extension         Increases demand for water in both&#13;
seasons.&#13;
C - Canal Capacity Increase          Increases effective supply of water by&#13;
releasing constraints on canal water&#13;
distribution in wet season.&#13;
D - Watercourse Improvement          Supplies more water to crops in both&#13;
seasons.&#13;
Thus, the several investment types can be described in terms of their&#13;
effect on demand for or supply of water, with A, C and D augmenting supply&#13;
in some sense and B increasing demand. Alternatively, each investment type&#13;
can be characterized in terms of its expected effect on the shadow price of&#13;
water, with A, C and D tending to increase it through their supply&#13;
augmenting effects and B and C tending to increase it through a demand&#13;
augmenting effect. Clearly, investments with the same kind of qualitative&#13;
effect on demand or supply ought to be substitutes and investments with&#13;
different qualitative effects, complements. Thus, the a priori&#13;
expectations are specified as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-&#13;
Investment Pair           Direction of Interaction&#13;
A,B                         Complements&#13;
A,C                         Substitutes&#13;
A,D                         Substitutes&#13;
B,C                         Complements&#13;
B,D                         Complements&#13;
C,D                         Substitutes&#13;
The estimates of complementarity-substitution effects between&#13;
investments are presented in Table 22. Comparing expected C-S effects with&#13;
the estimates for the two investment cases, the expectations are correct in&#13;
four out of six cases, with A and C expected to be substitutes but&#13;
estimated as complements, and B and C expected to be complements but&#13;
estimated as substitutes. Note, however, that A increases supply in the&#13;
dry season, while C increases supply in the wet season. Thus, there are&#13;
grounds for regarding them as effectively complementary. Note also that B&#13;
increases demand in areas where canals do not exist. Hence, the&#13;
complementarity between B and C is not effective in practice. Instead the&#13;
increase demand provided by B actually tends to reduce the effective demand&#13;
for C type supply increases due to competition for limited supply.&#13;
The interactions in cases with three or more investments involved&#13;
are too complex to derive determinate a priori predictions. However, the&#13;
results for some of these cases are quite plausible ex post.     For example,&#13;
B and A with D has a relative complementarity effect of 22 percent; and&#13;
this is not surprising, given the mismatch that A and D represent.&#13;

The measurement of the C-S effects of drainage investments with&#13;
other investments requires a different approach since required drainage&#13;
investments are defined by the solution to an experiment as those&#13;
investments needed to maintain the aquifer in static equilibrium. As an&#13;
alternative measure, we take the effect on net benefit of excluding&#13;
drainage costs to be an equivalent definition of complementarity-&#13;
substitution, where drainage costs are defined to be the additional costs&#13;
of drainage above a base case. In other words, complementarity would be&#13;
defined by the necessity of increased drainage costs if an investment is&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
The estimates of drainage C-S effects are given in Table 23. As&#13;
was expected, the only investments which are substitutes for drainage&#13;
investment are packages involving watercourse renovation/improvement (i.e.,&#13;
investment D). The class of investment reduces the drainage requirement by&#13;
reducing seepage losses along watercourses. One noteworthy result is the&#13;
very large relative complementarity effect with drainage of canal capacity&#13;
increases. Such investments require large induced drainage investments,&#13;
which is a linkage not generally recognized.&#13;
F. Summation of RAP Evaluation&#13;
Now that the rate of return measures have been examined, an&#13;
overall evaluation of the RAP is possible. Given the premises of the&#13;
projection to 1995, and this is an important qualification, the RAP&#13;
investments as aggregated into investment classes are all quite&#13;
productive. In a real sense, the relatively high productivity of the&#13;
water-related RAP investments depends on the success of GOP in implementing&#13;
the programmatic recommendations of the RAP--i.e., investments in adaptive&#13;
&#13;

agricultural research, expansion and improvement of agricultural extension&#13;
services and improved canal system management. In addition, sustained high&#13;
productivity depends on the establishment of an efficient method of&#13;
conjunctive use of surface and ground waters, and this will require&#13;
breaking new ground both politically and institutionally. Thus, the&#13;
simulation results are estimates of the potential returns from the RAP&#13;
investments and are not unconditional forecasts of actual returns if the&#13;
investments are undertaken.&#13;
With respect to the mix of investments in the RAP, it has been&#13;
shown that the combination of reservoirs (A), irrigated area extension (B)&#13;
and watercourse improvement (D), along with associated drainage&#13;
investments, dominates all other combinations if sufficient savings are&#13;
available to undertake this combination of investments. The failure of the&#13;
canal capacity investments (C) to be included in the optimal package is due&#13;
to the thrust of the other investments, which tend to offset the need for&#13;
increased canal capacities. That is, reservoirs tend to increase rabi&#13;
diversions and decrease kharif diversions, but the pressure on canal&#13;
capacities is in kharif. Similarly, irrigated area extension draws on water&#13;
supplies that otherwise would have been diverted to existing canals (and&#13;
perhaps creating capacity bottlenecks). Finally, watercourse improvement&#13;
by decreasing seepage losses reduces the amount of water that needs to be&#13;
diverted at the barrage in order to deliver a given quantity to the root&#13;
zone. In addition, the canal capacity investments are particularly costly&#13;
in terms of induced drainage requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-&#13;
Already, elements of the investment sets B and D are being&#13;
undertaken; and the major investments of set A are undergoing a&#13;
comprehensive engineering feasibility and design review. Thus, the effect&#13;
of the program evaluation is to confirm the main lines of the investment&#13;
strategy set out in the RAP and to suggest that the canal capacity&#13;
investments (as a group) are unnecessary. The analysis also shows that the&#13;
reservoir investments would be attractive even without any power benefits.&#13;
This is useful since it means that these investments are justified even if&#13;
the price of electric power should drop to zero. The productivity of the&#13;
irrigated area extension investments goes somewhat against conventional&#13;
wisdom and is due to the impact on water supply of the major reservoirs and&#13;
the tubewell boom of the 1960s and 1970s. The simulation experiments also&#13;
strongly suggest that the tubewell boom is far from over, particularly if&#13;
Pakistan adopts a policy of letting domestic prices converge to social&#13;
opportunity costs. On the other hand, the experiments also say that&#13;
Pakistan is running out of water, and irrigated area extension may be out&#13;
of the question in the 21st century.&#13;
However, it must be strongly emphasized that sustaining, to say&#13;
nothing of increasing, the productivity of the agriculture of the basin is&#13;
dependent on a practical solution to the problem of conjunctive use.&#13;
Moreover, the high productivity of the RAP investments in the simulation&#13;
experiments stems in large part from the model's ability to achieve&#13;
efficient conjunctive use--diverting relatively more canal water (and&#13;
drainage investments) to saline groundwater areas and relying more heavily&#13;
(than historically has been true) on private tubewells in fresh groundwater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
areas. The model does this with the groundwater balance constraint, whose&#13;
shadow price is the tax or subsidy needed to induce the desired level of&#13;
private tubewell pumping. The resulting levels of taxes or subsidies turn&#13;
out to be high and raise questions concerning the political feasibility of&#13;
this particular instrument. This remains an important topic for future&#13;
research.&#13;
Beyond the problem of conjunctive use there is the obvious need&#13;
for more innovative and efficient system management. The high levels of&#13;
utilization of total water supply--from canal, tubewell, rainfall and&#13;
subirrigation sources--achieved in the model results may ultimately require&#13;
making canal water available to farmers on demand, at least within limits,&#13;
rather than total reliance on a fixed rotation schedule. To construct a&#13;
water supply regime of this kind would require drastic institutional&#13;
transformation and certain enabling investments, e.g., active control&#13;
structures at each watercourse gate. At this point it becomes clear that&#13;
the issue of improved system management has only been raised and not&#13;
answered in this exercise.&#13;
VI. AN APPLICATION TO SYSTEM MANAGEMENT&#13;
One of the major virtues of modelling of any economic system is&#13;
the capacity that it creates to simulate counterfactual scenarios of system&#13;
performance. In particular, this capacity permits the investigator to pose&#13;
penetrating questions with respect to system efficiency. In the previous&#13;
section, it was shown that the agricultural production system of the Indus&#13;
Basin could be induced to supply significantly greater output through a&#13;
carefully chosen allocation of water resources. In this section, this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-&#13;
insight into the responsiveness of the system to water allocation will be&#13;
explored systematically in a series of experiments designed to provide some&#13;
guidelines for improved efficiency of resource allocation.&#13;
Of course, any effort to assess the efficiency of resource&#13;
allocation must specify a criterion by which efficiency is to be measured,&#13;
and this criterion must be acceptable to the people of the country&#13;
concerned if the assessment is to be meaningful. It is proposed here that&#13;
the criterion of efficiency be maximization of the sustainable level of&#13;
agricultural production from available water, given a vector of prices.&#13;
The qualification with respect to prices is necessary since agricultural&#13;
production is quite sensitive to relative prices and the model does not&#13;
provide solutions that are optimized with respect to prices. That is,&#13;
while the model does provide important insights with respect to price&#13;
policy, the results from a model solution are conditional on the exogenous&#13;
price vector specified.&#13;
It may be objected that the criterion selected does not recognize&#13;
other significant social welfare objectives such as increased employment of&#13;
labor and a more egalitarian distribution of income. However, the reader&#13;
should recall that the purpose of this exercise is to assess the efficiency&#13;
of water allocation.&#13;
In the remainder of this section, the analytical framework for&#13;
the sequence of system management experiments is first presented and then&#13;
the results from these experiments are presented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78-&#13;
A. Analytical Framework&#13;
Clearly a complicated, large scale simulation model presents&#13;
problems of interpretation if mDdel solutions incorporate multiple&#13;
changes. For this reason, the sequence of system management experiments has&#13;
been designed to incorporate only single changes (from some reference case)&#13;
in each experiment. A number of the specifications of the experimental&#13;
sequence are essentially imposed by the choice of efficiency criterion --&#13;
i.e., maximization of the sustainable level of agricultural production from&#13;
available water, given a vector of prices. For example, the water&#13;
endowment of the system from rim station inflows must be specified in terms&#13;
of the best available estimates of long run supply (in terms of some&#13;
appropriate measure of central tendency). In the sequence of experiments&#13;
used to evaluate the irrigation benefits from Tarbela Dam, discussed in&#13;
section IV, the actual monthly mean flows for the post-Tarbela period,&#13;
1975-76 to 1979-80, were used. However, these flows were historically&#13;
somewhat high and also included flows on the Ravi and Sutlej Rivers that&#13;
are unlikely to be available in the future. Moreover, an estimator such as&#13;
mean monthly flow may be affected by very large but very exceptional&#13;
flows. For these reasons, the water endowment at rim stations for this&#13;
sequence of experiments was specified as the monthly flows of the median&#13;
season over the period from 1967-68 through 1979-80 at each of the rim&#13;
stations, with Ravi and Sutlej flows deleted. The resulting estimates (for&#13;
annual flows) are presented in Table 24.&#13;

Specification of the vector of prices to be used also presents&#13;
problems. In principle, an optimal water allocation should be determined&#13;
simultaneously with the vector of input and output prices. However, in&#13;
practice both the theoretical complexity of such a large system as well as&#13;
considerations of computational feasibility and data acquisition preclude&#13;
such an approach. In consequence, the simulation results are conditional&#13;
on the exogenous vector of prices selected. For convenience, the vector of&#13;
prices prevailing in 1976-77, the period for which much the data base was&#13;
collected, was chosen. Comparison established that relative prices in&#13;
other years were similar to those prevailing in 1976-77 except for&#13;
petroleum products and one agricultural commodity whose world price has a&#13;
very large variance. In order to provide a test of model sensitivity to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-80-&#13;
the price vector used as well as an indication of the long run equilibrium&#13;
effects of the large increase in the relative price of petroleum that&#13;
occurred in 1979-80, several experiments employed the price vector&#13;
prevailing in 1980-81. These price vectors are given in Table 25 at both&#13;
domestic and border prices. Where prices vary by agro-climatic zone, the&#13;
price given is for a representative zone.&#13;
The sequence of experiments that provide the framework for the&#13;
analysis of system management are laid out categorically in Table 26.&#13;
Experiment J is the base case in the analysis of system management. The&#13;
experiments listed to the right of experiment J in the third row constitute&#13;
the main sequence of single step variations in water allocation policy.&#13;
Thus, experiments J, Q, S and T all specify a minimum water allocation&#13;
based on historic water rights, where these are defined operationally as&#13;
the mean diversion over the pre-Tarbela (but post-Mangla) period, 1967-75.&#13;
However, experiments J and Q specify historic water rights in terms of each&#13;
polygon, while S and T specify historic water rights only at the provincial&#13;
level. Similarly, J and S specify monthly and Q and T specify seasonal&#13;
water rights. Experiment M substitutes the level of farm income derived&#13;
from a pre-Tarbela model solution (i.e., experiment C of section IV) as a&#13;
lower bound to farm income in place of the historic water rights&#13;
constraint. Experiments 0 and P drop all explicit distributional&#13;
constraints, with 0 including and P excluding the groundwater balance&#13;
constraint. Strictly speaking, experiment P does not provide a meaningful&#13;
long run water allocation, but it is included to show the effect of&#13;

dropping the groundwater balance constraint. The experiments listed below&#13;
experiment J on the third column of Table 26 retain J's specification of&#13;
long run rim station inflows and the historic water rights constraint in&#13;
the form of a monthly polygonal lower bound on canal diversions, but vary&#13;
prices or water loss characteristics. Experiments K and L substitute&#13;
1980-81 prices for 1976-77 prices, and in addition L increases energy&#13;
prices by 50 percent and drops the subsidy on fertilizer use. Experiment R&#13;
differs from experiment J in that losses along water courses have been&#13;
adjusted to reflect watercourse improvement and/or rehabilitation as&#13;
specified by the On Farm Water Management Project, a credit to Pakistan&#13;
which was recently approved by the World Bank.16/ Since the effect of use&#13;
of border prices on valuation and cropping patterns and intensity has&#13;
already been examined in section IV, the analysis in this section will be&#13;
confined to use of market prices.&#13;
B. Results from System Management Experiments&#13;
The experiments specified in Table 26 were completed with the&#13;
model configured in a water optimizing mDde--i.e., solved for an endogenous&#13;
water allocation. Since the experimental solutions maximize farm income&#13;
subject to farmer preferences with respect to family subsistence&#13;
requirements and risk aversion, these solutions represent the maximum&#13;
agricultural production that can be obtained given mDdel specification and&#13;
farmer preferences, and hence correspond to the efficiency criterion&#13;
adopted. In all experiments, existing stocks (i.e., 1975-76) of private&#13;
tubewells and tractors are given as initial conditions, and these stocks&#13;

can be augmented by endogenous private investments. The groundwater&#13;
balance constraint is imposed in all experiments except P. As before, this&#13;
implies that the value of the dual variable corresponding to this&#13;
constraint (i.e., shadow price) is the implicit tax or subsidy that is&#13;
required to induce farmers to pump their tubewells at the level required&#13;
for aquifer equilibrium. This tax or subsidy must actually be imposed, at&#13;
least indirectly, for the model solution to be meaningful. Similarly, in&#13;
the saline groundwater areas, the objective function of the polygonal&#13;
sub-models includes a term for drainage costs. The interpretation is that&#13;
farmers in these areas demand that amount of canal water diversions which&#13;
maximizes their utility, given public drainage costs which they expect to&#13;
pay for in the form of some kind of tax. Since the government controls the&#13;
canal water diversions, it is not actually necessary that this tax be&#13;
imposed in order to induce the desired level of agricultural production.&#13;
It is necessary, however, that drainage costs be taken into account in&#13;
determining the efficient water allocation. In the model this is done by&#13;
assuming that the government has social welfare objectives which are&#13;
completely consistent with maximizing farm output subject to farmer&#13;
preferences. In this fashion, two-level programming problem discussed in&#13;
the Appendix can be solved in a linear programming model--i.e., the&#13;
physical externality imposed by the groundwater aquifer can be internalized&#13;
via a tax or subsidy.&#13;

C. Effects of System Management Policies on Production and Factor&#13;
Utilization&#13;
As before, production is measured in terms of value-added. Since&#13;
our concern is efficiency, i.e., relative performance, production is&#13;
measured relative to experiment D of section IV, which approximates actual&#13;
post-Tarbela conditions. In addition, results from experiments K and L are&#13;
not presented here in order to confine discussion to policies directed&#13;
toward changes in water distribution. The effect of the several such&#13;
policies specified in Table 26 on agricultural value-added and employment&#13;
is given in Table 27. Note that while the overall gains range from 17 to 20&#13;
percent above the post Tarbela level for value added,and from 14 to 16&#13;
percent for employment, the gains are markedly different between fresh&#13;
groundwater (FGW) areas and saline groundwater (SGW) areas. The former&#13;
show increases of only 2 to 4 percent for both measures, while the latter&#13;
have gains of 55 to 65 percent in value added and from 45 to 54 percent in&#13;
employment.&#13;
The striking difference between the output responses of FGW and&#13;
SGW areas clearly signals similar shifts in resource utilization, and Table&#13;
28 presents some results on the intensity of use of labor and land. Note&#13;
that the data from the post-Tarbela simulation (experiment D) show&#13;
divergent levels of input intensity for both inputs between FGW and SGW&#13;
areas. At the level of the entire basin, the effect of alternative system&#13;
management policies is to bring the levels of input intensity much closer&#13;
to equality between the two groundwater quality regions, with this being&#13;
accomplished by large increases in intensities for the SGW areas and&#13;
relatively small increases in the FGW areas. However, when these data are&#13;

disaggregated by major provinces, the picture is somewhat different. In&#13;
Punjab, while the trend remains the same, the SGW areas lag significantly&#13;
behind the FGW areas in input intensity under all policies. On the other&#13;
hand, in Sind the SGW areas show greater input intensities under most&#13;
policies. Thus, the SGW areas of Sind show much higher input intensities&#13;
than do the SGW areas of Punjab.&#13;
The reason for these divergent patterns becomes clearer when&#13;
relative water supplies are taken into account, and these data are shown in&#13;
Table 29. As might be expected, water supply per acre also shows a pattern&#13;
of large increases in the SGW areas and small increases in the FGW areas&#13;
under all water allocation policies. However, the quantity available per&#13;
acre in Sind SGW areas is almost twice as large as in Punjab SGW areas. In&#13;
fact, both the FGW and SGW areas in Sind show significantly greater total&#13;
water supplies than the corresponding areas in Punjab under all policies.&#13;
This is a surprising outcome since it is often argued that the&#13;
interprovincial distribution of surface water is skewed toward Sind because&#13;
of political factors. Yet these experiments, which include some which&#13;
release all distributional or equity constraints, show the same pattern of&#13;
relatively greater distribution of surface water in Sind. It might be&#13;
argued tht the physical capacities of the irrigation system for diversion&#13;
at various points have constrained the model solutions to this outcome.&#13;
However, when the shadow prices on capacities of link and main canals are&#13;
examined, this turns out not to be true to a significant degree. Part of&#13;
the difference in available annual supplies is due to significantly greater&#13;
sub-irrigation in Sind, which is an uncontrollable (by farmers) source that&#13;
peaks in months when farmers have relatively little land under crops. Yet,&#13;

canal diversions to SGW areas are significantly greater in Sind, and this&#13;
circumstnce argues for greater marginal productivity of water there. One&#13;
factor contributing to higher productivity in this region of Sind is its&#13;
comparative advantage in rice cultivation, which has benefited importantly&#13;
from the introduction of the high yielding new varieties. Thus, the higher&#13;
productivity of inputs in the water-intensive rice crop has resulted in&#13;
significantly higher optimal diversions to the SGW areas of Sind.&#13;
D. Effects of System Management Policies on Farm Incomes.Public Aquifer&#13;
Control Costs and Resource Prices&#13;
Since per capita income is a useful and frequently used measure&#13;
of economic development, albeit an imperfect one, a review of the impact of&#13;
the system management experiments on per capita farm incomes has&#13;
considerable interest. Note however, that the necessary existence of&#13;
transfer payments--due to the introduction of a tubewell pumping tax or&#13;
subsidy--somewhat complicates the concept of farm income. Thus a&#13;
distinction must be made between income from farm operations proper--i.e.,&#13;
unadjusted income--and income that allows for the impact of the tax or&#13;
subsidy-i.e., adjusted income.    The annual public costs of aquifer control&#13;
for each of the system management experiments are given in Table 30. These&#13;
costs, which are largely subsidy costs, range from 800 to 1,200 million&#13;
rupees per year. Adjusted per capita incomes by provinces and groundwater&#13;
quality zones are given in Table 31 which shows Sind incomes are greater&#13;
than Punjab incomes for both groundwater quality zones and under all&#13;
policies. Basinwide adjusted per capita incomes show increases of 19 to 22&#13;
percent, with increases ranging from 2 to 13 percent in the FGW areas and&#13;
from 46 to 84 percent in SGW areas. Unlike the current post-Tarbela&#13;

situation, per capita incomes are greatest in Sind SGW areas under all&#13;
policies and incomes in Punjab SGW areas are slightly greater than in&#13;
Punjab FGW areas under most policies. Thus, although the objective was&#13;
more efficient resource utilization, the alternative policies have&#13;
significant income distributional implications by water quality zone, with&#13;
something close to equality between zones achieved in Punjab and a reversal&#13;
of the present situation in Sind. Note, however, in absolute terms every&#13;
zone gains in per capita income, and all of the alternative policies are&#13;
Pareto improving. In addition, the public costs of aquifer control per&#13;
head of farm population, which range from 35 to 50 rupees, are small in&#13;
relation to the gains in per capita incomes.&#13;
Of course, the impact of the alternative policies on the incomes&#13;
of the several groups within a region may be adverse. This possibility is&#13;
explored in the following section, which reports some results from a&#13;
regional model disaggregated by farm size and tenure status. However, some&#13;
information on income distributional impacts by class is available in the&#13;
form of the shadow prices on the land and water constraints. These data&#13;
are summarized in Table 32. Note the very large increases in the implicit&#13;
land rents in the SGW areas under all of the alternative policies, and the&#13;
corresponding sharp decreases in water prices in these areas. A similar&#13;
pattern occurrs in the FGW areas, but as expected the magnitudes of the&#13;
changes are much smaller. It seems clear that landowners, especially in&#13;
the SGW areas, are well-positioned to capture much of the increse in farm&#13;
incomes. The extent to which tenants and landless laborers benefit from&#13;
the increase in aggregate farm production depends on the relative changes&#13;
in the demand for and supply of farm labor.&#13;

The results from experiments K and L, which were run using&#13;
1980-81 prices, were very similar to the results from experiment J, which&#13;
differs from them only in the price parameters. The important change in&#13;
relative prices (and only these matter for the model) in these experiments&#13;
is a sharp increase in the prices of fuels and fertilizer. These changes&#13;
in costs reduce value-added and farm income, slightly for experiment K and&#13;
significantly more for experiment L, which raises energy prices by an&#13;
additional 50 percent. Since these changes directly affect private&#13;
tubewell operating costs, the resulting increase in the optimal pumping&#13;
subsidy caused the public costs of aquifer control to increase by factors&#13;
of 2 and 4 in K and L respectively.&#13;
In order to test the sensitivity of the results from the system&#13;
management experiments to the mDdel assumptions with respect to drainage&#13;
costs, experiment J was repeated several times with drainage costs&#13;
increased to 1.5, 2, 3, 5, and 10 times the original level. In these&#13;
experiments, public costs of aquifer control incresed (in the above&#13;
sequence) by 10, 29, 54, 103, and 168 percent, and per capita incomes in&#13;
the SGW areas decreased by 0.3, 1, 2.5, 4.5, and 9 percent (in the same&#13;
sequence). Overall farm income remained virtually constant throughout this&#13;
sequence of experiments, with increases in the FGW areas offsetting&#13;
decreases in the SGW areas. Thus, the results from this sequence of&#13;
experiments have demonstrated that the model results are robust with&#13;
respect to drainage cost estimates.&#13;

VII. A MODEL OF INTER-FARM INCOME DISTRIBUTION&#13;
In this section, a regional variant of the Indus Basin models, a&#13;
model of Inter-Farm Income Distribution (IID), is used to examine some&#13;
issues concerning the inter-farm distribution of the benefits from varying&#13;
modes of system management and from a major investment in irrigation. That&#13;
is, for a subset of the polygons, the modelling of agricultural production&#13;
is disaggregated to distinguish among farms of different sizes and tenure&#13;
status. The area chosen, in the south of the Punjab, is the site of a&#13;
recent World Bank project and includes both fresh and saline groundwater&#13;
polygons. Within each polygon, three farm types are distinguished, each&#13;
with a separate farm model. The first type is small farms. The second is&#13;
farms operated by a sharecropper, who pays a fixed share of farm crop&#13;
output to the owners of the third type, large farms. In addition, there&#13;
are markets for seasonal labor, private tubewell water and tractor&#13;
services. Private investment in tubewells and tractors is limited to large&#13;
farmers, who sell the services of these capital goods to the other farm&#13;
types. Landless laborers may sell seasonal labor services, and all three&#13;
farm types may purchase seasonal labor.&#13;
The other versions of the Indus models are focussed on water&#13;
investment and allocation throughout the basin, and considerations of cost&#13;
and computational feasibility have led to a simple representation of the&#13;
agricultural production system within each polygon. In consequence,&#13;
experiments with these variants shed no light on the impact of the changes&#13;
studied on the inter-farm income distribution. IID was constructed to&#13;
remedy this gap in understanding. That is, it is posited that the effect&#13;
on the inter-farm income distribution of the IID area induced by various&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-96-&#13;
forms of policy intervention will be representative of their effects in&#13;
other areas of the basin. For this reason, it was necessary that the area&#13;
selected have both fresh and saline groundwater areas since the effects of&#13;
policy intervention often vary sharply with groundwater quality. The&#13;
experimental strategy is to obtain solutions of IID corresponding to the&#13;
canal water allocation for each of the major experiments in system&#13;
management and the Tarbela investment evaluation of sections IV and VI. In&#13;
this way, insight into the income distributional implications of some major&#13;
policy interventions previously analyzed can be had.&#13;
In the remainder of this section, the structure of IID is&#13;
described and the inter-farm income distributional effects of the system&#13;
management experiments and the Tarbela evaluation experiments are presented&#13;
and analyzed.&#13;
A. Structure of the Inter-Farm Income Distribution Model&#13;
For simplicity, it was decided to make the groundwater quality&#13;
areas independent. That is, the structure of IID is block diagonal, as&#13;
shown in Figure 6. This feature of model design greatly simplifies&#13;
interpretation of model results, although at the cost of neglect of&#13;
economic interaction between adjacent areas via markets for inputs and&#13;
outputs. However, given that both the basinwide model and its regional&#13;
income distributional variant, IID, are fixed price models, inter-area&#13;
propagation of economic disturbances is effectively ruled out by design.&#13;
In simple consequence, model results provide the income distributional&#13;
implications of the specified changes in system operation or structure&#13;
conditional on a vector of prices. For this reason, detailed modelling&#13;
of the regional labor market was not attempted, and the approximating&#13;

assumption was made that sales of family labor are not made between farms&#13;
of different types. This is not strictly true, and for that reason the&#13;
model results are only approximate since off-farm sales of family labor to&#13;
farms of another type or for non-agricultural purposes are not included in&#13;
the income estimates. Inasmuch as there are significant numbers of&#13;
landless laborers, the assumption on sales of labor to farms of another&#13;
type is largely correct and harmless most of the time.17/ That is, model&#13;
solutions indicate hires of non-family labor that are less than the&#13;
available supply of landless labor in all but three months (April,&#13;
November, and December). To go beyond the model's treatment of labor&#13;
markets, which is admittedly inadequate, would require making the wage of&#13;
hired labor an endogenous variable and estimating supply functions for&#13;
family, landless and migrant labor. Such a transformation would&#13;
effectively convert a water allocation and investment model into a labor&#13;
demand and supply model. While this would be an important and interesting&#13;
study, it is beyond the scope of the present inquiry. That is, IID is not&#13;
designed to study the effects of changes in relative factor prices on&#13;
income distribution, but rather to examine the income distributional&#13;
effects (insofar as this is possible within the structure of the Indus&#13;
family of models) of varying modes of system management and of a major&#13;
irrigation and power investment. However, the sensitivity of model results&#13;
to specification of prices can be examined by repeating experiments using a&#13;
different vector of prices.&#13;
17/ Using data from the 1972 Census of Agriculture, the number of landless&#13;
labor households in the region (i.e., Rahim Yar Khan) in 1976-77 are&#13;
estimated at 26,600, for a population of 159,400 people and 24,300&#13;
male equivalent workers providing 4,860,000 man-hours per month, about&#13;
equally divided between permanently and casually hired workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-99-&#13;
The areas selected for specification of IID are in Rahim Yar Khan&#13;
District in the south of Punjab Province. The fresh groundwater area is an&#13;
aggregation of polygons 17 and 19, and the saline groundwater area is&#13;
polygon 18, of the Indus models. One of the advantages of using areas&#13;
from a given political district is the ability to use district data from&#13;
the 1972 Agricultural Census of Pakistan to define the tenure relationships&#13;
and representative farm types to be incorporated into mDdel structure. The&#13;
relevant data on farm operator tenure status and farm size are given in&#13;
Table 33. Note particularly, the ambiguity introduced by the mixed or&#13;
owner-cum- tenant group. In addition, agricultural census data on the&#13;
ownership side disclosed that at least 20 percent of the land was held by&#13;
non-farmer landlords. After a review of the literature and some discussion&#13;
with knowledgeable Pakistanis, the following simplifying assumptions were&#13;
made:&#13;
1. All non-farmer landlords are relatives of farmers and the&#13;
operating unit is the consolidated family holding.&#13;
2. All farmer landlords with operating units of less than 25&#13;
acres are trying to consolidate fragmented holdings by&#13;
combined leasing out and in operations--i.e., treat small&#13;
mixed operators as pure owners.&#13;
3. All mixed operators with operating units of 25 or more acres&#13;
are either engaged in combined leasing in and out operations&#13;
for consolidation purposes, or superior farm managers&#13;
attempting to exploit their managerial resource more fully.&#13;
In either case, it is reasonable to assume that the farmer&#13;
earns as much per acre as a pure owner--i.e., treat large&#13;
mixed operators as pure owners.&#13;

4. There is only one class of tenants, those who sharecrop on&#13;
operating units of less than 25 acres. Tenants with 25 or&#13;
more acres are relatives of farmers and the operating unit is&#13;
the consolidated family holding.&#13;
Application of assumptions 1 to 4 to the census data on ownership&#13;
and operating units leads to the following classification of farm types:&#13;
1. Small farmers (acres less than 25): 66,840 farmers on&#13;
586,534 acres.&#13;
2. Large farmers cum landlords (25 or more acres): 12,602&#13;
farmers controlling 851,197 acres. Of this land, 530,326&#13;
acres are owner operated and 320,871 acres are tenant&#13;
operated.&#13;
3. Tenant farmers: 33,613 farmers who sharecrop with landlords&#13;
on 320,871 acres.&#13;
While this typology cleared up the classification of farm sizes and tenure,&#13;
the definition of the resource endowment per farm is still incomplete. For&#13;
example, not all of the arable land in this arid district is actually&#13;
irrigated. The agriculture census revealed that only 1,232,400 acres of&#13;
land were irrigated. Hence, all farm sizes were scaled down by the ratio&#13;
of this number to the total area of 1,437,731 acres.&#13;
Another important difference in endowment is groundwater&#13;
quality. Only part of the area has access to usable fresh groundwater. A&#13;
related distinction is that between perennial and non-perennial canal water&#13;
supply. Perennial areas receive canal water year round, and non-perennial&#13;
areas are entitled to canal water deliveries only in the summer or kharif&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-&#13;
season--i.e., from April 15 to October 15 of each year. It so happens that&#13;
the saline groundwater and perennial areas coincide almost exactly. In the&#13;
absence of any specific evidence, it was assumed that farm type sizes were&#13;
the same in both the FGW and SGW areas.&#13;
The agricultural census also disclosed that population per farm&#13;
operating unit increased with size, and these data were used to interpolate&#13;
an expected population for each farm type. Census data on farm demgraphy&#13;
were also used to convert the population of each farm type into a monthly&#13;
adult male equivalent endowment of labor. Finally, population and labor&#13;
endowment but not the number of farm operating units were adjusted upward&#13;
to reflect population growth between census data collection for year end&#13;
1972 and mid- 1976, the start of the base period for the simulation&#13;
experiments. The resulting specifications of resource endowment for the&#13;
several farm types is presented in Table 34.&#13;

In addition to the above-mentioned items, some farmers own&#13;
tubewells and/or tractors. Census data indicated that the owners of such&#13;
productive assets were overwhelmingly large farmers. Accordingly,&#13;
ownership of tubewells (in the FGW area) and tractors was assigned to large&#13;
farmers, and each large farm was endowed with its share of existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103-&#13;
tubewell capacity (if in the FGW area) and its share of existing tractor&#13;
capacity. The model is structured to permit large farmers to sell tubewell&#13;
water (if in the FGW area) and tractor services to small farmers. Also,&#13;
large farmers can provide these services to their tenants on a sharing of&#13;
operating costs basis. Private investment activities in tubewells (FGW&#13;
area only) and tractors are included in the submodels for the large farms.&#13;
B. Income Distributional Results from IID Simulation Experiments&#13;
The strategy of the simulation experiments with IID is to solve&#13;
the model with the specification and canal water allocation from the&#13;
corresponding experiment from sections IV and VI. In this way, the IID&#13;
solution provides some insight into the income distributional implications&#13;
of the solutions to the experiments on Tarbela evaluation and system&#13;
management. For clarity of presentation, the IID experiment will be&#13;
labelled with the same letter as the corresponding experiment from sections&#13;
IV and VI.&#13;
Before viewing income distributional results from the&#13;
experiments, it is necessary to establish that the solutions of IID&#13;
acceptably reproduce the solution results from the corresponding polygonal&#13;
sub-models of the basinwide experiments. This kind of validation is&#13;
necessary since the IID model is not identical to the corresponding&#13;
polygonal sub-models. Due to the disaggregation into farm type models,&#13;
there is no reason to expect that the IID solution results will be the same&#13;
as those from the polygonal sub-models of the basinwide experiments in&#13;
spite of the high degree of similarity in structure and use of the same&#13;
estimates for most mDdel parameters. Clearly, the comparison of greatest&#13;
interest is between estimates of total farm income, and this is given in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104-&#13;
Table 35. Note that the IID estimates are within 8 percent of the Indus&#13;
Basin estimates for the fresh groundwater (FGW) area and within 4 percent&#13;
for the saline groundwater (SGW) area. In general, the IID estimates are&#13;
lower than the Indus Basin estimates, which is to be expected since IID has&#13;
more constraints on the solution space for the sub-models. For the mean of&#13;
actual pre- and post-Tarbela surface water allocations (experiments C and&#13;
D), the IID estimates are within 4 percent of the MOGHA estimates. These&#13;
are perhaps a better validation test since the basinwide model was&#13;
validated using these allocations. A comparison of cropping patterns,&#13;
animal stocks and cropping intensity results is given in Table 36 for the&#13;
mean post-Tarbela allocation experiments without groundwater balance&#13;
(experiment D). Given the disaggregation of IID into farm type models,&#13;
each with its own set of consumption constraints and varying resource&#13;
endowment, the close similarity of these detailed solution values for&#13;
resource use is quite reassuring.&#13;
A major feature of the Indus family of models is the incorpora-&#13;
tion of a groundwater balance constraint in almost all experiments with&#13;
endogenous canal water allocations. This feature, which is necessary if&#13;
model solutions with endogenous canal water allocations are to reflect the&#13;
objective of sustaining the productivity of the Indus Basin indefinitely,&#13;
does have significant income distributional as well as public policy&#13;
implications. As noted previously, the value of the dual variable (i.e.,&#13;
shadow price) corresponding to the groundwater balance constraint has the&#13;
interpretation of the tax or subsidy on private tubewell pumping that will&#13;
induce the level of pumping required for balance, and this must be imposed&#13;

if the mDdel solution is to be a reliable simulation of farmer response to&#13;

feasible to take the primal value for private tubewell pumping as a basis&#13;
for setting individual pumping quotas, and to specify the shadow price as a&#13;
tax penalty on above quota pumping. Under these conditions, farmers have no&#13;
incentive (assuming detection is certain) to pump above quota.&#13;
However, when the dual variable sign is such that a subsidy is&#13;
required, then the subsidy must be paid if farmers are to be mDtivated to&#13;
pump at the level required for balance. As we have seen, while the&#13;
experiments evaluating the RAP investments at a 1995 horizon generally&#13;
require a tax on pumping, the experiments of sections IV and VI generally&#13;
require a subsidy. If the subsidy is paid to well-owners, it will have&#13;
significant income distributional implications. It is true that economic&#13;
theorists have devised countervailing measures that in principle offset the&#13;
effect of the subsidy. For example, in the context of the IID model, a lump&#13;
sum tax on large farmers (in FGW areas) could be used in principle to&#13;
neutralize the income distributional effects of the subsidy. Of course, in&#13;
practice the lump sum tax may not be politically feasible. Real world&#13;
examples of the use of such selective lump sum taxes are quite rare. For&#13;
this reason, the IID income distributional results will be shown both&#13;
unadjusted (i.e., without subsidy included) and adjusted (i.e., with&#13;
subsidy included). The difference can be quite significant in welfare&#13;
terms, as the data presented in Table 37 indicate. The difference between&#13;
adjusted and unadjusted per capita farm income can be as much as 25&#13;
percent. However, in some cases, the two numbers are almost identical&#13;
(e.g., experiments 0 and T).&#13;

Of course, the subsidies are paid to only one group, large&#13;
farmers in the FGW area, and Table 38 provides a breakdown of per capita&#13;
incomes by farm type and area. These data make it clear that the subsidy&#13;
can get quite large for well-owners. On the other hand, in a number of&#13;
cases, a tax rather than a subsidy is required--e.g., experiments 0, S,&#13;
T-and adjusted income is less than unadjusted income.      Whether a subsidy&#13;
or a tax is required depends critically on the level of private tubewell&#13;
pumping required to achieve groundwater balance. This relationship is&#13;
shown quite clearly in Figure 7, which plots the tax or subsidy rates and&#13;
costs (or revenues) against the level of tubewell pumping for a number of&#13;
experiments which differ only in canal water allocation.&#13;
The per capita farm incomes by farm type and area of Table 38&#13;
reproduce an important feature of the system management experiments of&#13;
section VI: per capita incomes rise sharply in the SGW area and remain&#13;
about the same in the FGW area as in the experiments with historical canal&#13;
water allocations.18/ The mechanism by which these results are achieved&#13;
is variation in canal water allocations, and consequent variation in the&#13;
tax or subsidy on private tubewell pumping. The essence of the experiment~&#13;
is the progressive removal of constraints on canal water allocation. The&#13;
effect on water allocations is shown for selected experiments in Table 39.&#13;
Note that the solutions to experiments J and T reduce the mean annual&#13;
18/ Some of these experiments show a small decrease in per capita incomes&#13;
from post-Tarbela levels for all farm types in the FGW area, e.g., 0,&#13;
S, T, and all of the system management experiments show such a&#13;
decrease for small farmers in the FGW area.&#13;

post-Tarbela allocation to the FGW area by 18 and 28 percent respectively,&#13;
with most of the larger proportionate reductions concentrated in the rabi&#13;
months. In contrast, the canal water allocations to the SGW area are&#13;
increased by 35 percent over the post-Tarbela level in both experiments,&#13;
with most of the larger proportionate increases in the rabi mnths. As the&#13;
canal water allocation to the FGW area decreases, the required tubewell&#13;
pumping decreases and the level of the tax or subsidy responds sensitively&#13;
to the reduction in required pumping level. As section V showed, the&#13;
required tax or subsidy is also quite sensitive to technical progress and&#13;
prices that reflect social opportunity costs. In fact, simply getting the&#13;
prices set at efficiency levels might be sufficient to eliminate any need&#13;
for subsidy. More generally, the results from all experiments with respect&#13;
to the tax or subsidy on pumping suggest the need for broadly coordinated&#13;
and flexible public policy for agriculture if the problem of efficient&#13;
conjunctive use of ground and surface waters is to be resolved&#13;
satisfactorily.&#13;
C. Measures of Income Inequality&#13;
The literature on the various measures of income inequality is&#13;
long and controversial. For a good summary discussion, the reader is&#13;
referred to Kakwani (Chapter 5). For present purposes, it is perhaps&#13;
sufficient to observe that the two measures to be used, the Gini&#13;
coefficient and the standardized E index, satisfy the principle of&#13;
transfers, i.e., any transfer from a rich person to a poor person reduces&#13;
inequality. The issue of the relation of a summary measure of inequality&#13;
to social welfare is the core of the significant literature on inequality&#13;
measures, which is well summarized by Kakwani. With respect to the Gini&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112-&#13;
coefficient, it suffices to note that if the distribution in question can&#13;
be represented by a single parameter Lorenz curve, a class which includes&#13;
the Pareto and lognormal distributions, then social welfare is a monotone&#13;
decreasing function of the Gini coefficient when the social welfare&#13;
function is non-decreasing, symmetric and quasi-concave in income.&#13;
The construction and estimation of the measures of inequality to&#13;
be used, the Gini coefficient and the standardized E index, is discussed in&#13;
Kakwani. It is well-known that the Gini coefficient can be shown to be&#13;
equal to one minus twice the area under the Lorenz curve, and the&#13;
standardized E index can be interpreted as a normalization of a message&#13;
that transforms uniform prior probabilities into posterior probabilities&#13;
measures by observed income shares. Both measures range over the unit&#13;
interval, with zero denoting perfect equality and unity, perfect&#13;
inequality. The estimates of these measures for both unadjusted and&#13;
adjusted farm income distributions are presented in Table 40. These&#13;
estimates yield a number of interesting and significant inferences. For&#13;
instance, comparing the estimates for experiments C and D (i.e., pre- and&#13;
post-Tarbela mean allocations in models without groundwater balance but&#13;
with complementary private investments), it is clear that the Tarbela&#13;
reservoir investment resulted in a significant reduction in income&#13;
inequality. Introducing groundwater balance in the mean post-Tarbela mdel&#13;
(experiment F) reduces inequality on an unadjusted basis but increases it&#13;
on an adjusted basis compared to the same model without groundwater balance&#13;
(experiment D). More generally, the effect of the adjustment due to the&#13;
tax or subsidy on tubewell pumping on the inequality measures is often&#13;
marked, as the ratios of adjusted to unadjusted income measures shown in&#13;
&#13;

Table 41 indicate. These data confirm the disturbing income distributional&#13;
implications of large subsidies, which can increase the inequality measures&#13;
by as much as 50 percent. However, it is also true that the effect is minor&#13;
or even positive in many experiments (e.g., M, 0, S, T). This reaffirms the&#13;
previous conclusion that public policy toward conjunctive use of ground and&#13;
surface waters must be formulated in coordination with all other elements of&#13;
agricultural policy so that adverse income distributional consequences are&#13;
controlled by the effects of other policy instruments. In general, there is&#13;
some combination of interventions that permits efficient conjunctive use&#13;
without unacceptable side effects on income distribution.&#13;
The estimates of inequality measures shown in Table 40 are well&#13;
within the range of variation established by other estimates of these&#13;
measures for South Asian countries, as the estimates presented in Table 42&#13;
clearly show. However, some of the adjusted estimates of Table 40 are&#13;
outside the range of estimates for rural households in Pakistan shown in&#13;
Table 42. This finding reinforces the previous argument for broadly-based&#13;
approaches to the resolution of the problem of efficient conjunctive use so&#13;
that any income distributional consequences are kept within acceptable&#13;
limits. The major problem of political feasibility is clearly the shift in&#13;
relative position of farmers in the different water quality zones. In&#13;
effect, the mDdel solutions reverse on efficiency grounds the divergence in&#13;
incomes between the two zones due to the private tubewell boom of the 1960s&#13;
and 1970s. Such a reversal is probably politically impossible. However, a&#13;
convergence to equality between zones might be achieved over time by a&#13;
combination of policies whose combined effects would be difficult for&#13;
interest groups to discern. A frontal attack on either efficiency or equity&#13;
grounds would almost certainly be blocked by a coalition of interests.&#13;

VIII. An Assessment of Potential Gains in Agricultural Production in the&#13;
Indus Basin&#13;
In the preceding sections, the effect of a number of policies,&#13;
some actual and some counter-factual, on the irrigated agriculture of the&#13;
basin were analyzed using simulation experiments with the Indus models. In&#13;
this section, the results from these experiments are briefly summarized and&#13;
decomposed into component policies in order to assess the growth potential&#13;
of the basin if certain important policy packages are adopted.&#13;
The method employed is to take the level of agricultural&#13;
production achieved with the preferred package of RAP investments, i.e.,&#13;
ABD, as a reasonable estimate of growth potential by 1995, and then&#13;
decompose that estimate into component policies. It will be recalled from&#13;
section V that the RAP evaluation involved a number of assumptions which&#13;
require policy action to be valid--e.g., improved system management via&#13;
more efficient canal diversions and imposition of long run groundwater&#13;
balance, improved agricultural technology via investments in adaptive R and&#13;
D and improved extension services, use of social opportunity costs (i.e.,&#13;
border prices) as the basis of domestic prices of purchased agricultural&#13;
inputs and outputs. Thus, the production levels achieved in the RAP&#13;
evaluation experiments are by construction reasonable estimates of long run&#13;
growth potential. The decomposition is accomplished by taking differences&#13;
between selected pairs of experiments. Thus, the difference between&#13;
experiment B at domestic prices and experiment D at border prices gives the&#13;
combined effect of the shift to efficiency prices, private investments&#13;
complementary to Tarbela and increased fertilizer availability. The&#13;
difference between experiments J and D, both at border prices, gives the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117-&#13;
combined effect of long-run groundwater balance and more efficient&#13;
allocation of surface water. The difference between the base case for RAP&#13;
evaluation (i.e., the future without investments) and experiment J at&#13;
border prices gives the effect of improved agricultural technology.&#13;
Finally, the difference between the experiment evaluting the investment&#13;
package ABD and the RAP base case gives the effect of these RAP&#13;
investments. The results from these calculations are shown in Table 43.&#13;
The estimate of a potential basinwide increase in agricultural production&#13;
by 1995 of almost 200 percent is reasonable in the light of agricultural&#13;
productivity levels already achieved in the irrigated agriculture of&#13;
comparable arid regions elsewhere. However, taking 1977 as the base year,&#13;
it implies annual growth of 6.2 percent--a growth rate which has been very&#13;
seldom achieved in agriculture elsewhere over a period as long as two&#13;
decades. More precisely, it shows what could happen if the policies&#13;
specified were successfully implemented.&#13;
The asymmetry of the agricultural supply response of the two&#13;
groundwater quality zones to different policy measures is strikingly&#13;
demonstrated in Table 43. Both the combined effect of efficiency prices,&#13;
complementary private investments and increased fertilizer supply and the&#13;
effect of improved agricultural technology have much stronger effects in&#13;
the FGW areas, while improved system management and the RAP investments&#13;
have much stronger effects in the SGW areas. Clearly, a mix of the two&#13;
kinds of policies is needed not only for efficient growth but also to&#13;
distribute equitably the benefits of growth. With strong growth inducing&#13;
policy measures available for both water quality zones, the disturbing&#13;
income distributional implications of improved system management for FGW&#13;

areas discussed in the preceding section can be offset by measures designed&#13;
to increase incomes in the FGW areas. Thus, the assertion of that section&#13;
that there is some combination of interventions that permits efficient&#13;
conjunctive use without unacceptable side effects is supported by results&#13;
shown in Table 43.&#13;
The effects of the policies specified for achieving basinwide&#13;
agricultural production potential on effective water utilization, canal&#13;
diversions and private tubewell pumping are given in Table 44. Not&#13;
surprisingly, the asymmetry of policy effects between FGW and SGW areas&#13;
already seen for agricultural production carries over to water demand and&#13;
tubewell pumping. It is, in fact, the flexibility in water use that&#13;
private tubewells provide that is the basis of the stronger response of the&#13;
FGW areas to some policies. On the other hand, as Table 44 demonstrates,&#13;
it is also true that the strong response of the SGW areas to some policies&#13;
is due to the effect of these policies in facilitating greater canal&#13;
diversions to the SGW areas.&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
THE INDUS BASIN MODELS AS A SPECIAL CASE OF&#13;
TWO-LEVEL LINEAR PROGRAMMING&#13;
This paper is centered around a large-scale modeling effort designed&#13;
to aid in the specification of surface and ground water policies in Pakistan.&#13;
Rather than giving the reader a detailed exposition of the model (a formidable&#13;
task by itself), we have chosen to limit our model description to a minimum,&#13;
and concentrate instead on those aspects which, we feel, are important to&#13;
understanding. In particular, there is the problem of hierarchical decision&#13;
making [4], [5], [6]. Economic models designed for policy analysis usually&#13;
involve two kinds of agents: policy makers and policy receivers. If the&#13;
policy receivers are optimizing agents, one is faced with a hierarchical&#13;
decision making problem, or equivalently, a multi-level programming model. As&#13;
the response surface of policy receivers is, in general not necessarily&#13;
convex, an overall problem involving both types of agents may be a non-convex&#13;
programming problem. In that event, remedies such as using a weighted&#13;
combination of the two objective functions will result in meaningless&#13;
solutions. As it turns out, however, linear programming techniques can be&#13;
used in the case of the Indus Basin problem. First, however, we will provide&#13;
a generic introduction to the concept of multi-level programming, and conclude&#13;
with a description of the Indus Basin model family as a special case of multi-&#13;
level programming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-123-&#13;
1.  An Introduction to Multi-Level Programming&#13;
Whenever there is a set of nested optimization problems, one can&#13;
speak of multi-level programming problems. This terminology was introduced by&#13;
Candler and Norton [2], and several economic policy applications are discussed&#13;
in their paper. A general mathematical definition of multi-level programming&#13;
is not attempted in this paper as it involves an unwieldy expression of&#13;
symbols and brackets. We have chosen to give a general definition of the two-&#13;
level programming problem, leaving any generalizations to the reader. Assume&#13;
that there is one policy maker (or "outer" decision maker) and one groups of&#13;
independent policy receivers (the "inner" decision maker). Let x be the&#13;
(n2xl)-vector of variables controlled by the outer decision maker, while the&#13;
(nlxl)-vector y contains the decision variables of the inner decision maker.&#13;
Then the general two-level programming problem can be written as follows.&#13;
Minimize            f2(x,y)&#13;
x&#13;
s.t.          g2(x,y) = 0&#13;
h2(x,y) &gt; 0&#13;
{minimize     fl(x,y)&#13;
ylx&#13;
s.t.      g1(x,y) = 0&#13;
h1(x,y) &gt; 0}&#13;
Note that the inner optimization problem is nothing else but one of&#13;
the constraints of the outer problem. In the inner optimization problem&#13;
itself the x variables are considered as given. The outer objective function&#13;
could be vacuous, but if the inner one is not, one is still faced with a two-&#13;
level programming problem. The above problem can be viewed as a two-player&#13;
Stackelberg game employing the leader-follower solution concept. The leader&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-124-&#13;
is assumed to have complete knowledge of the behavior of the follower. It is&#13;
precisely this authority between the leader and the follower that induces a&#13;
natural solution to the above mathematical problem, provided, of course, that&#13;
the optimal reaction y*(x) is unique for the relevant choices of x. If this&#13;
is not the case, the above problem does not have a solution, and additional&#13;
information must be added to the problem. Whenever y*(x) is not convex, the&#13;
overall problem has local optimal solutions. As one cannot assume a priori&#13;
that y*(x) is convex (even in the case of linear problems!), one must assume&#13;
in general that the two-level programming problem is non-convex. This&#13;
observation provides challenges to the mathematical programming community, but&#13;
despair to all practioners faced with multi-level programming problems and&#13;
desiring globally optimal solutions. As we shall see next, however, there is&#13;
a large class of linear two-level programming problems that can be solved for&#13;
global solutions using mixed interger-linear programming.&#13;
Using the same (x,y)-notation as before, consider the following two-&#13;
level programming problem.&#13;
Minimize     c2x&#13;
x&#13;
s.t.    A21y               + A22x &gt; b2&#13;
x&gt; O&#13;
(1.2)&#13;
{Minimize   cTy   + 1y Qy + xTCTy&#13;
ylx&#13;
A11y  +  A12x &gt; b,&#13;
y O }&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-125-&#13;
Here cT is (1 x ni), Q is (n, x nl) and symmetric, cT is (n2 x ni),&#13;
and Aij is (mi x n.) for i = 1, 2 and j = 1,2. This is, at least to our&#13;
knowledge, the largest class of two-level programming problems that is still&#13;
solvable using commercial software. Consider the following rough&#13;
derivation. If one writes the Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the inner&#13;
optimization problems with x constant, one obtains a linear complementary&#13;
problem [3]. Embedding this linear complementarity problem in the outer&#13;
optimization problem gives us problem (1.3).&#13;

type, a mixed integer linear programming code such as APEX of CDC (which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126-&#13;
accepts continuous variables as part of its special ordered sets) can be used&#13;
to solved the above problem [1].&#13;
The proposition of using a mixed integer linear programming code to&#13;
solve linear two-level programming problems is an expensive one, as these&#13;
codes are usually slow in finding a proven global optimal solution. It is&#13;
certainly an unrealistic suggestion in the case of the Indus Basin Model where&#13;
the augmented problem becomes too large for the machine. As it turns out, the&#13;
Indus Basin Model contains specific characteristics that allows one to use&#13;
linear programming techniques to solve the two-level programming problem.&#13;
2. The Indus Basin Model as a Special Case of Multi-Level Programming&#13;
In the Indus Basin Model each polygonal representative farm is an&#13;
independent unit, so that summing the individual farm-level objective&#13;
functions over all 53 polygons provides us with a single objective function&#13;
representing the entire agricultural sector. Maximizing the aggregated net&#13;
farm income can be considered as a proxy for maximizing welfare. In that&#13;
sense both the government and the farmers share the same objectives, and no&#13;
special distinction needs to be made. The two groups do differ, however, in&#13;
that the government wants to satisfy a set of political constraints and long-&#13;
term ground water balance requirements that are outside the realm of the&#13;
farmers, and, as such, are not recognized by them. The Indus Basin Model can&#13;
therefore be viewed as a special example of a two-level programming problem&#13;
where the outer objective function is vacuous. Using a notation similar to&#13;
that of problem (1.2), we can write the following mathematical statement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-127-&#13;
A21Y  +   A22x    -   b2&#13;
x   &gt;   0&#13;
{Minimize   cTy + d yT                                      (2.1)&#13;
y i(x,d)&#13;
s.t.   Ally    +   A12x   &gt;   b &#13;
y   &gt;   0}&#13;
Here both x and d are considered policy variables that pertain to&#13;
the government. The vector x contains all variables that are not under the&#13;
director control of the farmers, and that are not in d. Surface water&#13;
allocations to the farmers, for instance, comprise some of the x-components.&#13;
The vector d represents a set of subsidies and taxes that the government wants&#13;
to impose on farmers' water related activities. Note that these control&#13;
variables enter the inner objective function in a multiplicative fashion,&#13;
thereby making the above problem bilinear. A setting of both x and d will&#13;
result in a response y* by the farmers which in conjunction with the x values&#13;
may or may not satisfy the outer constraints of (2.1).&#13;
In order to solve the above problem (2.1), the following algorithm&#13;
can be applied. Add for the moment the outer constraints to the inner&#13;
optimization problem, and set the vector d equal to zero. Next solve the&#13;
resulting linear program, and denote the optimal solution as (x,y) . Let the&#13;
vector w be the corresponding set of optimal dual prices associated with the&#13;
-TT           --T&#13;
outer constraints.   Then if the government sets x = x   and d   = d  = -w A21,&#13;
one can verify, using duality theory that y* = y is the optimal response for&#13;
the farmers in the problem&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-128-&#13;
T -T&#13;
Minimize      (cl + d )y&#13;
y|(x,d)1&#13;
s.t.        Ay +A12 x&gt; b1                                 (2.2)&#13;
y &gt; 0&#13;
By construction, the resulting pair (x,y*) = (x,y) satisfies the&#13;
outer constraints.    The intuitive reason as to why y* = y     solves problem&#13;
(2.2) is that the transformation of the inner objective function from      c1y   to&#13;
(ccT + dT )y has caused the outer constraints to become redundant as far as&#13;
the farmers are concerned. Another way to express the same intuitive idea is&#13;
to say that if the outer constraints were added to problem (2.2), their shadow&#13;
prices would be zero.&#13;
It is important to note that after one computes the values of&#13;
(x, d, y) for the augmented linear program, one must also solve the inner&#13;
problem (4.2) with the policy variables fixed at (x, d) . This is an&#13;
unfortunate but necessary step to make sure that the optimal response y*(x,d)&#13;
is unique. As we noted in section 1, without this uniqueness property, the&#13;
solution to (2.1) is not defined. In this case the inner agent has no a&#13;
priori reason to choose the value y that also satisfies the outer&#13;
constraints. A transfer payment (bribe) from the outer agent is needed to&#13;
induce the inner agent to select the y that satisfies the outer constraints.&#13;
Even though the vector (x, y, a) obtained by the above procedure&#13;
solves the two-level programming problem (4.1), the actual values of x and d&#13;
may not be politically acceptable. An example could be the surface water&#13;
allocation scheme. As each representative polygonal farmer has an equal&#13;
weight in the aggregated farmers' objective function, allocations of scarce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-129-&#13;
water will naturally favor the efficient farmers. This could result in&#13;
optimal water allocations i that essentially ignore certain regions within the&#13;
country. Such water allocations will be unacceptable to the regional&#13;
government representatives who will insist that a minimum percentage of&#13;
surface water must be allocated to them. This implies an increase in the&#13;
number of outer constraints, which in turn requires the generation of a new&#13;
solution (x, y, d).     By comparing the optimal solutions and the&#13;
corresponding objective function values, one can evaluate the impact of such&#13;
political constraints.&#13;

            Issues of efficiency and interdependence in
            water resource investments : lessons from the Indus Basin of Pakistan
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper reports the results from some
            experiments utilizing models of the irrigated agriculture of
            the Indus Basin of Pakistan. The models are unique in that
            they integrate agricultural production with a surface water
            distribution system and a groundwater aquifer system for a
            large river basin. Each of the models incorporates a special
            case of two-level hierarchical decision-making with the
            policy maker (the government) and policy receivers (farmers)
            in the analysis of agricultural production response. The
            models are mostly configured in a long run comparative
            statistical mode and include endogenous private investment
            in tubewells and tractors. These tools were designed for
            evaluation of investment projects and programs and
            assessment of irrigation system management, but have been
            adapted for other purposes as well.
