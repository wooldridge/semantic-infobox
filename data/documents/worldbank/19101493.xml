&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
Since the late 1990s, Uganda has been undertaking an ambitious program to&#13;
reduce national poverty, emphasizing pro-poor service delivery and promoting&#13;
equitable economic growth. The urban water sector, specifically, has been the&#13;
focus of wide-ranging reforms targeted at reaching the poor.&#13;
&#13;
At the institutional level, the national public water authority responsible for service&#13;
delivery in Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s towns and cities - National Water and Sewerage&#13;
Corporation (NWSC) - has been implementing a raft of policies explicitly focused&#13;
on improving delivery of services to the urban poor.&#13;
&#13;
This study examines the extent to which these reforms have increased water&#13;
coverage within Kampala City, specifically in informal settlements where the&#13;
majority of poor households reside.&#13;
&#13;
This collaborative effort by the World Bank and NWSC seeks to identify and&#13;
document what works and what does not in reform measures aimed at reaching&#13;
the poor, and highlights the gains and challenges of making service delivery&#13;
pro-poor and managing service delivery reform to improve effectiveness and&#13;
accessibility.&#13;
&#13;
We hope that this knowledge will contribute more insights to guide reforms&#13;
aimed at improving access to basic services by the poor, and enhance the&#13;
effectiveness of pro-poor mechanisms employed in the urban water sector.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                            â&#128;¢	 House connection: Individual metered house connection to the water supply network where the&#13;
                               point of supply is inside the house, and therefore associated with internal plumbing, showers,&#13;
                               taps, sinks, storage tanks, and so on. A house connection is always associated with some kind of&#13;
                               drainage system (network, pit, and so on).&#13;
&#13;
                            â&#128;¢	 Yard tap: Similar to the individual house connection except that the point of supply is in the yard&#13;
                               and is usually shared between a small number of households (usually two to three). A yard tap is not&#13;
                               usually associated with internal plumbing or a drainage system.&#13;
&#13;
                            â&#128;¢	 Public water point: Metered connection which is typically a battery of taps fed by one connection&#13;
                               and recognized as such by the NWSC. Public water points are usually managed directly by the&#13;
                               NWSC or someone appointed by it (for example, a community group, an individual, and so on).&#13;
&#13;
                            â&#128;¢	 Kiosk: Typically, a battery of taps developed by a private individual (operator or community-based&#13;
                               organization) to sell water to the public. Kiosk operators usually charge a mark up on the normal&#13;
                               tariff. A kiosk implies a formal structure and attracts the preferential public water point/kiosk tariff.&#13;

&amp;#12;It is considered that the organizational structure     increase in connections from 2004 onwards is&#13;
of the NWSC (with IDAMCs and individual staff          double that of the pre-2004 period (14,500 and&#13;
performance contracts) has contributed to these        7,000 new connections per annum, respectively).&#13;

                                                       However, the rate of increase is dependent on&#13;
The growth of NWSC connections from 2002/03            demand and the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s ability to implement&#13;

significant increase in connections. This may be       per year (post-2004). This is considered prudent&#13;
due to high population growth or to the fact that      given the limitations on the water network and&#13;
fewer households are sharing connections.              water production capacity, as well as the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

However, in net terms this means that the NWSC         addition, it is considered that much higher rates&#13;

The profile of unit consumption at prepaid PWPs/                      In addition, it is considered that low unit&#13;
kiosks and yard taps is markedly different.                           consumption at PWPs is due to the presence of&#13;
                                                                      a large number of alternative sources of water&#13;
Similar to yard tap connections, 57 percent of the                    which are free or cheaper than the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s piped&#13;
prepaid PWPs report consumptions of less than                         drinking water. Thus, if individual household&#13;
3.6 m3 per monthâ&#128;&#148;which equates to 20 lcpd for                         consumption at PWPs is lowâ&#128;&#148;it is only reflective&#13;
a family of six (120 liters per day per household).                   of the volume of water which households&#13;
This is low given that the prepaid PWPs are                           purchase for drinking and cooking. Other uses,&#13;
shared between many households, but may be                            including washing and ablution, are met with&#13;
due to the fact that the prepaid water supply                         other sources of water, including but not limited&#13;
PWPs are still at the pilot scale and thus not yet                    to wells, boreholes, springs, and public ablution&#13;
fully integrated within the communities they serve.                   blocks (for example, public and private Sulabh&#13;
                                                                      toilets/showers).&#13;
However, close to 30 percent of prepaid PWPs&#13;
report consumptions greater than 10 m3 per                            Pictures 1 and 2 illustrate prepaid public water&#13;
month (55 lcpd for a family of six), similar to                       points/kiosks and yard taps in Kisenyi, a low&#13;
normal PWPs.                                                          income but formal settlement in Kampala. The&#13;

One factor that may impact on individual                              can be the same: the only difference is in the&#13;
consumption at prepaid PWPs is the availability                       location of the yard tap/PWP (public thoroughfare&#13;
of tokens to purchase water from these PWPs,                          or gated private land), or the number of people&#13;
and the ease with which users are able to keep                        using it, and under what name the yard tap/PWP&#13;
the tokens topped up with credit. Individual                          is registered with NWSC.&#13;
consumption at prepaid PWPs may actually be&#13;
higher once more such PWPs and more tokens&#13;
are provided.&#13;

          For comparison: the ONEA in Burkina Faso has a subsidy factor of five between industrial customers and public standpipes. But the ONEA is reported to have&#13;
          exclusive right to the use, and management, of water resources in a dry environment, whereas NWSC customers can obtain water from alternative sources, if this&#13;
          becomes more economical.&#13;

&amp;#12;                   Box 4: Assessment of the quantity of subsidy that targets poor households&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   Using NWSC data presented in Table 16, it is possible to estimate the total quantity (in UGX) which goes&#13;
                   to poor households, making an assumption that the proportion of yard taps over domestic customers is&#13;
                   similar in the NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s service area as it is in Kampala. By calculating the average tariff per customer category&#13;
                   (using total revenue/customer category divided by volume billed) it is possible to estimate the flow of funds&#13;
                   that customer categories receive or contribute. Thus it is possible to estimate the level of subsidy that poor&#13;
                   households receiveâ&#128;&#148;per annum. This is summarized below.&#13;

                   The table suggests that PWPs receive on average UGX395,000 per annum subsidy, or UGX2,631 per person&#13;
                   per annum (assuming one PWP serves 150 people). Whilst it is not possible to estimate the average subsidy&#13;
                   received for yard taps compared to nonpoor connections, the average subsidy for connections is UGX68,319&#13;
                   per annum or UGX10,295 per capita (assuming a weighted average of 6.6 people per connection), which is&#13;
                   nearly four times as much. The consumption subsidy thus unequally favors nonpoor households instead of the&#13;
                   poor (PWPs and yard taps). This is due to the fact that they only use a small amount of water and that they&#13;
                   are not connected.&#13;

expansion in unserved areas.&#13;
&#13;
Water supply coverage has increased significantly&#13;
over the period, from 62 percent to 74 percent,&#13;
despite a population growth rate of 10 percent.&#13;
The total number of connections in Kampala has&#13;
increased from 59,000 in 2004 to 146,000 in&#13;
2010. Whilst most of the beneficiaries have been&#13;
the nonpoor (and industries), this increase has&#13;
had positive impacts on the poor by leading to a&#13;
reduction in the price of resold water. However,&#13;
the rate of new connections in poor settlements&#13;
has sharply reduced from 2009 onwards. This&#13;
is considered to be due to the fact that 18&#13;
percent of yard taps and 36 percent of PWPs are&#13;
inactive. This has prompted the Urban Pro-Poor&#13;
Branch, with support from development partners&#13;
(principally the KfW and GPOBA) to look for&#13;
innovative service delivery mechanisms, including&#13;
prepaid PWPs. This new approach is expected&#13;
to generate significant benefits to unserved areas                                                             Â© WSP&#13;

&amp;#12;                         The differentiated tariff structure (including the   stagnant 40 percent of water produced lost, from&#13;
                         PWP tariff) is considered to be affordable even      2004 to 200. This is in spite of NWSC taking&#13;

                         The level of the discounted cost of connection&#13;

4.1 Cost implications:&#13;
&#13;
Based on cost scenarios generated and presented for different lengths of service pipes, the Board&#13;
accepted the average distance of 50 meters from NWSCâ&#128;&#153;s service point as ideal in terms of cost&#13;
implications.&#13;
&#13;
Cost per connection:&#13;
The cost break down for a typical domestic water connection based on the distance of 50 meters is&#13;
given in the table below:&#13;
&#13;
Estimated cost per connection (typical domestic Â½â&#128;&#157; connection)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Item	                                       Measurement	       Unit cost (shs)	         Total cost (shs)&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
  Labour	                                      50 meter	          660 shs/meter	              33,000&#13;
&#13;
  Total			                                                                                   243,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The average cost per connection of a Â½ inch pipe supply is therefore estimated at Shs 243,000. This&#13;
cost does not include the cost of a meter which has always been an NWSC cost.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the model for the domestic cost estimate, the cost for the other customer categories were&#13;
estimated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
Water points/standpipes:	 Shs 400,000&#13;
Government Institutions:	 Shs 350,000&#13;
Commercial Industrial:	   Shs 450,000&#13;
&#13;
The following table indicates the estimated annual cost of providing service lines for 14,000 new&#13;
connections based on the mean distance of 50 meters from the NWSC service point.&#13;

&#13;
                         From the table above, the total costs to cover the provision and maintenance of service lines to&#13;
                         customers within a distance of 50 m would be about Shs. 3.78 billion.&#13;

&#13;
                         In order to raise the Shs. 3.78 billion for the provision and maintenance of service lines, the tariff has&#13;
                         been increased by an average of about 10% as shown in the table below. It should be noted that in line&#13;
                         with the policy of re-balancing of the tariff, large industrial customers (consuming over 500 cu.m of water&#13;
                         per month) have been excluded from the tariff increase.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                         It should be noted that the change in tariff is solely due to the transfer of responsibility of providing and&#13;
                         servicing consumer lines from the user to the Corporation. For purposes of clarification, the table below&#13;
                         shows the impact of the change on the price of a 20 liter jerrican of water.&#13;

6.0 Implementation&#13;
&#13;
The Board in its two sittings on the 18th and 24th June 2004 approved the implementation of the new&#13;
policy based on the following tenets:&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 The policy covers only water connections.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 The policy will cover all customers within a distance of 50 meters from the NWSC service point.&#13;
         All materials and other costs including road reinstatement to be met by the Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 The cost in excess of 50 meters to be met by applicant.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Customers will continue to pay the connection fee (e.g. shs 50,000 for domestic customers) as a&#13;
         commitment and contribution to the service.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 The tariff is to be adjusted by an average of 10% to defray the additional costs of providing and&#13;
         maintenance of service lines up to the customers meter.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 As in the case of the electricity industry, all service lines will henceforth belong to NWSC. This will&#13;
         allow more consumers to be connected to the service lines.&#13;
&#13;
Following the Board approval, the Hon Minister of Water, Lands and Environment assented to the policy&#13;
through a statutory instrument (copy attached) which shall shortly be published in the Uganda Gazette.&#13;
As you will note the effective date of implementation is 1st July 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                    77&#13;

            Do pro-poor policies increase water
            coverage? : an analysis of service delivery in
            Kampala's informal settlements

        <abstracts>
            Uganda is one of the poorest countries
            in Africa with a gross national income (GNI) per capita in
            2010 of United States (U.S.) $500 compared with the
            Sub-Saharan regional average of $1,170. Uganda's
            population growth of over 3 percent per year, one of the
            highest in the world, puts a considerable strain on public
            sector service delivery, not just for water and sanitation
            but also in other areas such as health, education, and
            transport. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of
            the pro-poor policies introduced by the National Water and
            Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) between 2004 and 2010, by
            analyzing the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of these
            policies and strategies implemented by the Government of
            Uganda (GoU) and NWSC to increase coverage of urban water
            supply services in poor settlements. The study focuses
            exclusively on the area of Kampala city, the capital of
            Uganda, as this constitutes the largest service area of the
            NWSC - with approximately 60 percent of its connections and
            64 percent of its revenues. The assessment of the impact of
            the pro-poor policies on the poor in Kampala is based on an
            analysis of the effectiveness, the efficiency, and the
            equity of these policies since 2004. The report is divided
            into the following six chapters: chapter one gives the
            introduction of the report and presents the objectives and
            methods used. Chapter two presents an overview of the water
            sector in Kampala, including the legal, institutional, and
            regulatory framework, a definition of poverty in Kampala and
            what this means for poor households. Chapter three describes
            the urban water sector policy and the strategy developed by
            the NWSC to expand services and improve financial
            performance. Chapter four analyzes in detail the impact of
            NWSC policies and water supply delivery mechanisms on
            services to poor households in Kampala. Chapter five
            contains the conclusions of the study. Chapter six contains
            recommendations for further analysis which can be undertaken
            by the NWSC, GoU, and or the World Bank.
