Note No. 42   International Power Interconnections&#13;
Moving from electricity exchange to competitive trade&#13;
J. P. Cbarpentier   International electricity markets are complex, and experience with them is limited. Purely physical&#13;
and K. Schenk      exchange between countries already occurs where interconnection lines are in place. But trade&#13;
requires more sophisticated organizational structures and coordination. Harmonizing national or-&#13;
ganizational structures is a first step toward the freer flow of power across borders. Unbundling&#13;
national power sectors could help further in breaking bottlenecks, particularly in transmission. But&#13;
coordination needs much attention. Here, the key issue for policymakers is this: What terms and&#13;
conditions are needed to establish competitive regional electricity trade in which buyers and sellers&#13;
can, at any time and regardless of their locations, negotiate power and energy contracts covering a&#13;
wide spectrum of commercial products? This Note suggests some answers.&#13;

            International power interconnections :
            moving from electricity exchange to competitive trade
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            International electricity markets are
            complex, and experience with them is limited. Purely
            physical exchange between countries already occurs where
            interconnection lines are in place. But power trade requires
            more sophisticated organizational structures and
            coordination. Harmonizing national organizational structures
            is a first step toward the freer flow of power across
            borders. Unbundling national power sectors could help
            further in breaking bottlenecks, particularly in
            transmission. But coordination needs much attention. Here,
            the key issue for policymakers is this: What terms and
            conditions are needed to establish competitive regional
            electricity trade in which buyers and seller can, at any
            time and regardless of their locations, negotiate power and
            energy contracts covering a wide spectrum of commercial
            products? This Note states that, strictly speaking, there is
            still no electricity trade in the full sense. To achieve
            true electricity trade, these are the prerequisites: need
            and willingness, technical means, national institutions and
            regional operations, and pricing and contractual issues.
