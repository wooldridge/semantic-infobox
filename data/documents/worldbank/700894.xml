ABSTRACT&#13;
This report presents the findings of a five-year evaluation&#13;
of the First Lusaka Upgrading and Sites and Services Project. The&#13;
evaluation formed part of a four-country cooperative research project&#13;
supported jointly by the World Bank and the International Development&#13;
Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada. The evaluation, which was conducted&#13;
by a specially created Evaluation Team, within the Project Implementing&#13;
Agency, included both short-term operationally oriented studies and more&#13;
comprehensive socio-economic impact studies. The report contains four&#13;
main parts and an Executive Summary. Part 1 discusses the Project and&#13;
the political and economic context within which it evolved. The&#13;
remaining parts present the main evaluation findings with respect to&#13;
design and organization, efficiency of project implementation and&#13;
project impact.&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
This Executive Summary presents the main findings in the&#13;
evaluation of the First Lusaka Upgrading and Sites and Services Project,&#13;
and suggests lessons and issues which may be helpful in the planning of&#13;
future shelter projects in East Africa. We begin with an outline of the&#13;
political and economic context within which the Lusaka Project evolved,&#13;
and then present a set of indicators used in the Project's evaluation.&#13;
The final section discusses the possible contributions of this project&#13;
and evaluation experience to future development practice.&#13;
The Project Context&#13;
Prior to achieving Independence in 1964, Zambia had been a&#13;
junior partner in British East Africa. Lusaka had been designed as a&#13;
spacious "garden city" for Europeans and Asians, with Africans being&#13;
permitted to live there only while they were employed. African workers&#13;
lived either on the property of their employer or in "compounds" and in&#13;
most cases could not by accompanied by their families. Once employment&#13;
was terminated, a worker was required to leave the city and return to&#13;
his village. The housing policy called for demolition of unauthorized&#13;
structures; although "illegal" communities did develop outside the city&#13;
limits, no provision was made for them by local authorities.&#13;
The years following Independence saw a rapid growth in&#13;
Lusaka's population. This growth was due to a boom caused by high&#13;
copper prices, economic diversification, administrative expansion, and&#13;
a relaxation of controls on internal migration and new settlements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
Migration to the city was fueled by families coming to join spouses&#13;
already established there, and by a lack of employment opportunities in&#13;
the rural areas. Inevitibably, most of the new migrants moved to the&#13;
squatter compounds growing up around the periphery of the city.&#13;
The newly independent public administration soon found itself&#13;
responsible for two separate "cities." One was the former European and&#13;
Asian city with its well-planned layout and high service levels.&#13;
Administration of this sector, much of which had previously been&#13;
directed from London, was difficult enough because many expatriate&#13;
administrators left at the inception of Independence, but at least plans&#13;
and procedures had been established.&#13;
The other "city" consisted of the rapidly swelling squatter&#13;
areas which, after the expansion of Lusaka from 67 km2 to 360 km2 in&#13;
1970, represented about 40 percent of the total urban population. No&#13;
clear guidelines existed for the development of these squatter areas.&#13;
After initial attempts to continue the colonial policy of demolition, it&#13;
was accepted that eradication of the settlements was neither feasible&#13;
nor consistent with the official philosophy of Humanism. The situation&#13;
was complicated by the fact that the quasi-legal status of the squatter&#13;
areas meant they produced almost no revenue for the city to help cover&#13;
the costs of their development. The incorporation of these areas&#13;
contributed substantially to the decline in per capita revenue of the&#13;
City of Lusaka from 3.57 Kwacha in 1965 to 1.38 Kwacha in 1972.&#13;
The policy options were constrained further by the abrupt end&#13;
of the period of economic growth enjoyed in the 1960s. The combined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Flooding was a constant hazard in many squatter areas prior to the start of the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

effects of falling copper prices and the trade disruptions and military&#13;
expenditures caused by conflicts in Zimbabwe, Zaire and Angola were so&#13;
serious and prolonged that the per capita GDP of Zambia was lower in&#13;
1979 than it had been in 1965 or 1972. The deteriorating economic&#13;
situation made it imperative to seek less costly solutions to the&#13;
rapidly worsening shelter problems.&#13;
In Lusaka, as in many other parts of the world, the squatter&#13;
settlements were strongholds of major political parties that became the&#13;
ma^in protectors and advocates of the many thousands of people whose&#13;
right to live in the city was still only partially recognized by the&#13;
public authorities. Both the African National Congress and the United&#13;
National Independence Party developed very strong grass roots organiza-&#13;
tions and became very effective advocates of the rights of the "New&#13;
Majority." The right to a house and basic services was proclaimed as&#13;
one of the rewards of Independence, and stamping out housing inequali-&#13;
ties and geographical segregation were seen as part of the battle&#13;
against the vestiges of colonialism. After Zambia became a one-party&#13;
democracy, UNIP established a very effective organizational structure,&#13;
based on 25-family sections, in almost all the squatter areas.&#13;
A key theme throughout the development of the Lusaka Project&#13;
has been interaction between UNIP, the Housing Project Unit, and the&#13;
Lusaka City Council (now the Lusaka Urban District Council). While the&#13;
objective of the LCC was to integrate the project areas into the normal&#13;
administrative and financial systems of the city, UNIP saw its role as&#13;
ensuring that the underprivileged squatters received an equitable share&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of the rewards of Independence. The difficulties of establishing an&#13;
effective cost recovery system clearly illustrate the tension between&#13;
these two points of view.&#13;
The equity issue was complicated further by the policy of&#13;
providing housing subsidies for employees of government, local&#13;
authorities and parastatal organizations. The subsidies, which&#13;
originated as a colonial policy for attracting expatriate staff,&#13;
continue to be highly regressive and to benefit mainly the middle and&#13;
upper income groups. It is estimated that in 1978 about 44 percent of&#13;
all housing subsidies to public employees were received by the 10&#13;
percent with the highest incomes, while the poorest 30 percent received&#13;
only 1.8 percent of total subsidies. In total, the poorest 50 percent&#13;
of workers received only 10 percent of the subsidies. 1/ It was also&#13;
found that while housing subsidies represented less than 15 percent of&#13;
the total employment benefit package for the poorest 30 percent of&#13;
government employees, they represented over 40 percent of the benefits&#13;
for the 10 percent with highest incomes. In addition to being a&#13;
considerable drain on government resources, the long tradition of&#13;
housing subsidies seemed to render questionable the social justice of&#13;
the complete cost recovery requirement built into the World Bank-s&#13;
Project designed to serve the poorest urban groups. It was estimated,&#13;
for example, that many of the highest-income families were paying only&#13;
about 10 percent of the economic rent for their housing.&#13;

Public Sector in Zambia," Urban and Regional Report No. 81-6,&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

The factors detailed above determined the political climate&#13;
within which the Lusaka Project was planned and developed. The newly&#13;
independent Zambia wished to remove the vestiges of colonialism and to&#13;
give Africans the same benefits previously enjoyed by expatriates. The&#13;
philosophy of Humanism reinforced this sentiment by making social and&#13;
econonomic equality an important political objective. These ideals,&#13;
together with urban planning traditions, created pressures to provide&#13;
good, high-standard housing for everyone. Further, it was felt that&#13;
housing is a right, and that standards should be determined by needs as&#13;
much as by ability to pay. It was assumed that the pursuit of this&#13;
policy implied subsidies for the economically weaker groups. The&#13;
substantial housing subsidies provided to most public employees&#13;
strengthened the case for new categorical shelter relief.&#13;
The combined effects of the economic depression spanning most&#13;
of the 1970s and the rapid increase in demand for public services put an&#13;
increasing pressure on the resources available to the central and local&#13;
government authorities. These pressures lead to the more pragmatic&#13;
conclusion that lower standards must be accepted and that innovative&#13;
approaches, such as squatter upgrading and sites and services, must&#13;
become the basis of national housing policy. The potential contra-&#13;
dictions between political objectives and the economic realities have&#13;
continued to play an important part in the Project-s development.&#13;
The Administrative Challenge&#13;
To get an objective view of the Project-s achievements, it is&#13;
necessary to appreciate the enormity of the administrative tasks it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
entailed.   On top of the pressures created by Independence, departure&#13;
of expatriate staff, and assumption of functions previously administered&#13;
from London, the Lusaka City Council and central government agencies&#13;
were required to develop completely new administrative systems to handle&#13;
the 40 percent of the population living in the formerly "illegal"&#13;
squatter areas.&#13;
Besides the pressures these events placed on an understaffed&#13;
bureaucracy, the squatter areas also gave rise to strong political&#13;
influences,due to the activities of the two major parties (and of UNIP&#13;
after Zambia became a one-party democracy). The guiding policy of the&#13;
local party organization was to obtain as many services as possible for&#13;
the squatter areas from a recalcitrant public administration. Although&#13;
the party structure rendered considerable assistance in mobilizing&#13;
popular participation in planning and implementation, it created some&#13;
opposition to the integration of the areas into the normal administra-&#13;
tive structure of the City Council. Attempts to integrate the areas&#13;
more closely into the LCC nexus through Ward Development Committees had&#13;
to be abandoned due to the much more effective organization already&#13;
existing in the UNIP local party structure. Subsequently, the local&#13;
party organization has often opposed use of the stronger sanctions, such&#13;
as cutting off water or evictions, to improve cost recovery.&#13;
Most public housing and service programs have very poor cost&#13;
recovery records. In 1979, it was estimated that the seven largest&#13;
local authorities in Zambia had a total deficit of 28 million Kwacha on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
their housing accounts. 1/ The reasons for the deficit are a combina-&#13;
tion of poor administration and opposition to the use of sactions to&#13;
enforce payment. The fact that the Central Government is often one of&#13;
the worst defaulters complicates the situation further. Poor cost&#13;
recovery performance has created the widespread belief that high&#13;
defaults are inevitable for housing programs and consequently make it&#13;
more difficult to encourage the use of sanctions in the present&#13;
Project. Despite the poor cost recovery performance of the Project, its&#13;
record is much better than that of many other LUDC housing programs.&#13;
The matter of land acquisition illustrates well the adminis-&#13;
trative difficulties that confronted the Project. One of the major&#13;
political and economic reforms of the new regime was the elimination of&#13;
freehold land and the limitation of land value to its unexhausted&#13;
productive capacity. Although it was assumed that the increased&#13;
regulatory power of the government would greatly facilitate the process&#13;
of land acquisition, most of the new legislation was still untested at&#13;
the time the Project began. In fact, land acquisition proved to be the&#13;
most difficult obstacle to project implementation, causing delays of&#13;
more than two years in some phases of the process. In retrospect it is&#13;
possible to see how the process could have been accelerated: delays were&#13;
due in large part to the newness of the legislation and the HPU's&#13;
inexperience in applying it. 2/&#13;
1/   World Bank Data.&#13;
2/   These factors should not make us overlook the effect of the bureau-&#13;
cratic delays which prolonged the process still further (see&#13;
Chapter Five).&#13;

Criteria for Project Evaluation&#13;
Tables 1 through 5 summarize the main findings of the report&#13;
with respect to Project organization and design, physical implementa-&#13;
tion, efficiency, and impact on participants, the city, and housing&#13;
policies. Each of these areas is discussed in detail in the main body&#13;
of the report.&#13;
Table 1 shows that in general the Project was well designed.&#13;
Sites were well selected and house designs were accepted by most&#13;
participants. With respect to infrastructure, water and sewerage were&#13;
satisfactory, but street lighting and garbage collection were&#13;
inadequate. There was some dissatisfaction over issues related to the&#13;
extension of the road networks and the design of community facilities.&#13;
Table 2 shows that the internal organization of the HPU was&#13;
good but that problems arose in coordination with the City Council and&#13;
other agencies.&#13;
Table 3 shows that almost all of the targeted upgrading and&#13;
sites and services plots were serviced, but that a considerable&#13;
proportion of the serviced sites had not been developed. Similar&#13;
shortfalls can be observed with respect to the provision of community&#13;
facilities.&#13;
Table 4 presents indicators of the efficiency of Project&#13;
implementation. The most efficiently executed components of the Project&#13;
included selection of participants for sites and services, community&#13;
participation in Project planning, the process of house construction,&#13;
and the provisions ensuring Project affordability. At the other&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

extreme, significant problems arose with land acquisition and cost&#13;
recovery. Experience was mixed with mutual help construction, the use&#13;
of participants own labor in construction, and the operation of&#13;
material stores, the materials loan program, and Project maintenance.&#13;
Finally, Table 5 presents indicators of Project impact. Among&#13;
participating households, there has been some impact on income through&#13;
rental use of portions of housing. In the short run there was also some&#13;
additional wage income during the process of house construction. The&#13;
Project has generally improved the quality of housing and access to&#13;
water and gardens in which to grow food.  There is no evidence that it&#13;
has stimulated rural to urban migration or lead to overcrowding.&#13;
At the city level, the Project has yielded a dramatic increase&#13;
in housing stock. There has also been an important political impact&#13;
from the integration of the urban poor into the formal political&#13;
system. Impacts on national housing policy are more difficult to&#13;
evaluate, but considerable reductions in standards have been accepted,&#13;
and both sites and services and upgrading now form a central part of&#13;
national housing plans. The Project has also created an impulse toward&#13;
the rationalization of land policies and has raised the equity issue&#13;
related to current housing subsidies.&#13;
Lessons and Issues for Future Projects&#13;
One of the most useful functions of the evaluation has been to&#13;
draw conclusions which may be helpful to planners in other countries&#13;
considering urban shelter options. The issues are presented here in the&#13;
order in which they will normally occur in the design and planning&#13;
process.&#13;

Building materials                    Mixed               Essential to encourage house upgrading as no other sources of finance.  May have&#13;
encouraged use of more expensive materials such as cement blocks as cheaper options&#13;
not always sold. Insufficient funds to cover demand.&#13;
Infrastruture&#13;
Water supply                          Good                General satisfaction.  Some maintenance problems partly due to cutting off water as&#13;
part of cost recovery strategy.&#13;
Roads                                 Mixed               Road network greatly improved access to the city.  Considerable maintenance problems.&#13;
Lack of interior roads contributed to garbage collection problems.&#13;
Street lights                         Poor                Agreed level of lighting decreased.  Considerable dissatisfaction with lighting level.&#13;
Sewerage                              Good                General satisfaction with pit latrines.  Complaints of insanitary conditions when&#13;
shared.&#13;
Garbage collection                    Poor                Dissatisfaction.  Garbage often not collected from houses which do not have access to&#13;
roads where trucks enter. Lack of initial briefing to persuade households to carry&#13;
bins to main roads.&#13;
Community Facilities&#13;
Markets                               Poor                Markets develop spontaneously and there is probably no justification for including&#13;
them in the project.&#13;
Materials stores                      Mixed               Material stores an essential comiponent of the project as difficult to obtain materials&#13;
on the open market. High incidence of robberies suggest stores should be located&#13;
closer to other facilities rather than isolated.&#13;
Community centers                     Mixed               May have been better to let community plan, build and control centers.  Many under-&#13;
utililized. Multi-purpose center may not be consistent with cultural separation&#13;
of the sexes.&#13;

Impact on City&#13;
Housing stock             Increased by 11,500 units with 20,000 upgraded.  Value of housing&#13;
stock increased by at least 15 million Kwacha.&#13;
City finances             Considerable potential increase in tax base.  Project currently&#13;

higher level of services not covered by project financing.&#13;
Political impact          Integration of urban poor into political system.&#13;
Social impact             Social integration due to wide income spectrum in projects and to&#13;
location of urban poor in areas close to the city.&#13;
Transport                 Substantial improvements in transport systems partly through&#13;
stimulation of private transport companies.&#13;
Impact on Housing Policy&#13;
Housing standards         Acceptance of lower standards.  Ingration of sites and services&#13;
and upgrading into housing policies.&#13;
Land                      Increased awareness of land as constraint on housing development&#13;
and helped develop new land legislation.&#13;
Equity                    Increased awareness of the inequitable system of housing&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.   The Role of Shelter in National Development Strategies&#13;
A number of basic policy issues emerged during the development&#13;
of the First Lusaka Project, especially when the question of a possible&#13;
second project arose. The issues that will be common to many country&#13;
situations will be highlighted here:&#13;
*    Is the provision of low-cost urban shelter inconsistent&#13;
with the objective of stimulating rural development?&#13;
That the provision of low-cost housing will encourage&#13;
economically unproductive groups to stay in the city, or&#13;
worse, encourage rural to urban migration, is a common&#13;
development concern. Existing evidence suggests that&#13;
people migrate in search of better employment opportun-&#13;
ities, rather than for improved housing. It is unlikely&#13;
that the provision of housing per se will induce new&#13;
migration. However, as housing projects are often quite&#13;
expensive, they may use scarce resources that might&#13;
otherwise be invested in rural areas.&#13;
The major justification for low-cost urban shelter&#13;
programs is two-fold. First, even if migration from&#13;
rural areas stops completely, the demand for urban&#13;
housing will continue to grow due to natural population&#13;
increase. Therefore, there is a strong case for&#13;
providing some basic level of shelter for the existing&#13;
urban population. Secondly, a well-planned project, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
low standards and effective cost recovery, can almost pay&#13;
for itself, and consequently need not be a heavy&#13;
financial burden.&#13;
*    Should the provision of housing be treated as an employ-&#13;
ment benefit? Until recently, most housing in Zambia has&#13;
been provided at a subsidized rate as part of an employ-&#13;
ment package. Consequently, higher-paid workers tend to&#13;
receive higher housing subsidies.&#13;
Although it may be justified in certain cases, this&#13;
system is not to be recommended. The first argument&#13;
against it is that it amounts to a bias against the self-&#13;
employed. As housing tends to be provided at a&#13;
subsidized and controlled price by employers, there has&#13;
been no incentive for a private housing market to&#13;
develop, and the self-employed, unless they happen to be&#13;
wealthy, have no access to a housing market. The second&#13;
argument against this system is that it has tended to&#13;
provide high levels of housing support to upper and&#13;
middle income groups and thus to produce regressive&#13;
income distribution effects.&#13;
2.   The Appropriate Organizational Structure for Project Implementation&#13;
At both the planning and evaluation stages, the effect of&#13;
setting up a special project execution unit with a considerable degree&#13;
of autonomy was a key concern. There was a clear trade-off between&#13;
increased efficiency in staff recruitment and project implementation on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
the one hand, and long-term institutional development and project&#13;
replication on the other. There is no simple resolution of the issue.&#13;
Given the innovative nature of many prospective projects, and the&#13;
cumbersome, rigid structure of many municipal authorities, project&#13;
implementation may be seriously prejudiced by operating through&#13;
traditional channels. It is vital that first projects succeed if they&#13;
are to demonstrate the feasibility of a new approach.&#13;
The Lusaka experience suggests that the following factors&#13;
should be taken into consideration if a special project implementation&#13;
unit is created.&#13;
-Q   Special units often have more flexibility in terms of&#13;
salaries. If project unit staff are particularly well paid,&#13;
consideration must be given to what will happen when the unit&#13;
is merged with the municipality, so as to avoid the departure&#13;
of staff due to lower salary scales.&#13;
*    Coordinating mechanisms must be set up early on to ensure a&#13;
smooth transition.&#13;
*    Lines of responsibility for cost recovery and project&#13;
maintenance must be clearly defined as these components will&#13;
be under the long-term supervision of the municipality.&#13;
3. Land Acquisition&#13;
In the Lusaka Project, as in many others, administrative and&#13;
political complexities bearing on the process of land acquisition have&#13;
been the major cause of delays, and hence of cost escalation. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Lusaka experience suggests that the following issues must be considered&#13;
very early in project planning:&#13;
*    Does the acquisition of land require any special&#13;
legislation? If it does, it is essential to begin the&#13;
legislative process as early as possible.&#13;
*    Expert advice should be sought on problems likely to arise in&#13;
getting legislation approved and implemented. One common&#13;
problem is that nationalization tends to lower the value of&#13;
land and thus make owners less willing to sell. Another&#13;
source of problems is the likelihood of political opposition&#13;
from groups such as squatters, cooperatives, or small farmers&#13;
who presently occupy the land.&#13;
e    As land acquisition is likely to be the key factor in&#13;
determining the speed of project implementation, it may be&#13;
useful to set up a high-level committee authorized to take&#13;
expediting action.&#13;
The processes of land surveying and title search can be time-&#13;
consuming and require a considerable number of professional&#13;
staff. In the case of Lusaka, these professionals were not&#13;
available, adding to delays. A check should be made to ensure&#13;
the required professionals will be available, and provision&#13;
made for the training of staff or the use of expatriates or&#13;
consultants, if the need arises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
4. Issues Related to Project Finance&#13;
Several issues arose with respect to the system of Project&#13;
finance. Cost recovery proved to have an important impact on Project&#13;
implementation and long-term maintenance, as well as replicability. The&#13;
following are some of the issues likely to be faced in other countries&#13;
as well as Zambia:&#13;
*    Unless the issue of existing housing subsidies is resolved&#13;
very early, it is likely to give rise to political opposition&#13;
to cost recovery measures.&#13;
*    Cost recovery problems in the Lusaka Project were due partly&#13;
to administrative difficulties and partly to a lack of&#13;
political will in pursuit of defaulters. Both of these&#13;
liabilities are likely to be encountered in other projects.&#13;
There are several ways of coping with them. These include:&#13;
actively involving the community in the cost recovery process,&#13;
beginning at the planning stage; gaining the support of the&#13;
local political organizations which can persuade project&#13;
residents to cooperate in making payments, or taking&#13;
administrative steps to compensate for the lack of such&#13;
support; adequate information provided to the community on the&#13;
amounts and timing of payments and the reasons for them;&#13;
efficient administration of payment collection, including&#13;
prompt, accurate information to those who owe, and proper&#13;
payment facilities, such as convenient office hours.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
*    Materials loans have been an important facet of the Lusaka&#13;
Project and others, as most households have very limited&#13;
access to other sources of finance. Appropriate loan&#13;
estimation is a key factor here. Families must be provided&#13;
sufficient resources to complete a livable dwelling unit&#13;
without assuming financial burdens they cannot handle.&#13;
Another issue is whether loans should be given in the form of&#13;
materials vouchers redeemable only in project-related stores&#13;
or in the form of funds they can spend at their discretion.&#13;
In the case of Zambia, tied loans and material stores were&#13;
appropriate because the unavailability of materials would have&#13;
made it very difficult for families to procure needed supplies&#13;
on the open market. On the other hand, this system apparently&#13;
forced families to buy relatively more expensive materials&#13;
than they might have wished, because these were what the&#13;
project stores made available. In general, where a relatively&#13;
free building materials market exists, it may be better not to&#13;
tie purchases to a particular outlet.&#13;
A further question is whether vouchers are preferable to cash&#13;
disbursements. While there is a general suspicion that cash&#13;
may be used for purposes other than house construction, it is&#13;
also true that cash allows families the option of hiring labor&#13;
to help in the construction process. In Lusaka, an&#13;
unexpectedly high proportion of households did hire labor,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
suggesting that consideration should be given to cash&#13;
disbursements or to vouchers that could be used to hire labor.&#13;
5. Issues Related to Physical Design&#13;
The first issue of physical design to provoke extensive&#13;
discussion in Lusaka was that of plot size. It was apparent on the one&#13;
hand that land was relatively abundant in Lusaka, so planners felt that&#13;
households should be provided plots of a size appropriate both to&#13;
housing construction and to the growing of their own food. On the other&#13;
hand, too large a plot size would increase the cost of providing&#13;
services and hasten the time when land within the city would actually&#13;
become scarce.&#13;
The results of the evaluation suggest that there is a&#13;
considerable variation in the plot sizes families desire. Many families&#13;
have not in fact used the area surrounding their house for growing&#13;
food. It seems that the optimum planning option would be for a project&#13;
to offer a range of plot sizes with economic pricing so that families&#13;
desiring larger plot sizes would either have to pay more or be willing&#13;
to live on the periphery of the city, where land is cheaper. It does&#13;
not appear to be economical to provide large plots in centrally located&#13;
areas merely to provide families the option of growing food only to have&#13;
them decline to do so.&#13;
Research has also shown that provision of large plots is not a&#13;
very effective way to ensure lower population densities. Households&#13;
will begin to sublet or to have additional relatives move in, so that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
densities will increase wherever low-cost housing is constructed in&#13;
prime urban locations.&#13;
There was also considerable debate about the appropriate level&#13;
of services. Because there is a direct relationship between service&#13;
level and cost, it is necessary to offer a low service level as one&#13;
option in order to avoid excluding large groups on grounds of&#13;
affordability. Probably the ideal design is to begin with a low level&#13;
of services and to provide households with the option of upgrading at&#13;
such time as they are able to afford it. It will often be found that as&#13;
the demand for rental accomodation increases, many families will wish to&#13;
upgrade services in order to charge higher rents, so the process of&#13;
upgrading may be faster than expected.&#13;
There must be an effective system of cost recovery if&#13;
upgrading of services is to be self-financing, and households must not&#13;
be permitted to solicit service upgrading unless they are up to date&#13;
with all their service and loan payments.&#13;
Another disputed design issue was the question of the Project&#13;
road network. To reduce costs, the Project was originally designed with&#13;
many areas not directly accessible by roads suitable for vehicles.&#13;
Problems arose because garbage trucks were not able to reach all areas&#13;
of the Project, whereas the original intention was that households&#13;
should carry their garbage to collection points on the main roads.&#13;
Similar problems have arisen in several other countries where the&#13;
requirements of modern garbage collection technology have dictated&#13;
construction of large and extremely expensive road networks. Unless&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
there are strong reasons for an extensive road system, it would seem&#13;
better to insist that households transport their refuse the relatively&#13;
short distances to collection points to achieve a considerable cost&#13;
saving.&#13;
6. Issues Related to Community Participation&#13;
In Zambia and elsewhere, considerable importance was attached&#13;
to achieving a high level of community participation in Project planning&#13;
and implementation. Such an effort was to further the national goal of&#13;
grassroots participation in political life and to enhance the efficiency&#13;
of Project implementation. Chapter 7 of the Report describes how&#13;
popular participation was effectively organized at the planning stage,&#13;
where it served to promote general acceptance of what could have been a&#13;
very disruptive upgrading process, but there was much less success in&#13;
organizing mutual help construction. The use of community pressure was&#13;
even less effective as part of the cost recovery process. The following&#13;
are some of the important issues that emerged from the Zambia context&#13;
but are relevant to many countries:&#13;
*    It is necessary to define clearly whether the community is to&#13;
have an active role in decision-making as to project design&#13;
and priorities or whether the objective is simply to ensure&#13;
community support for decisions which have already been&#13;
made. In Zambia, as elsewhere, there was a certain&#13;
ambivalence on this point. If the cooperation of the&#13;
community is to be sought in securing a high rate of cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
recovery, it must be involved in the selection of services and&#13;
must be given a full understanding of the financial structure&#13;
of the project.&#13;
*    With respect to mutual help construction, it must be decided&#13;
whether this is to be a training experience in community&#13;
organization, a method of reducing project costs, or an&#13;
opportunity for the community to earn money which can then be&#13;
spent on additional resources the community wants to&#13;
develop. In Zambia, there was some confusion in this area,&#13;
and in some cases residents were pressured to participate in&#13;
mutual help efforts without a very clear idea of objectives.&#13;
Although mutual help activities can be an effective way of&#13;
providing practical training in group organization, experience&#13;
suggests that it should probably not be made compulsory.&#13;
Instead, community groups should be given the opportunity to&#13;
participate if they so desire. The financial incentives used&#13;
in the Zambia Project seems to be a useful means of&#13;
encouraging families to participate.&#13;
*    Careful thought needs to be given to the role of the community&#13;
in the cost recovery process. If there is to be community&#13;
involvement, it should begin early enough to allow prospective&#13;
participants some power in the project design process. It&#13;
will almost never be possible to involve community members&#13;
simply as collection agents, for they have no incentive to&#13;
pressure defaulters to pay. As the Zambia experience showed,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
if local political groups are involved in the collection&#13;
process, there is always the possibility that they will&#13;
disagree with the use of sanctions and may thus make it even&#13;
more difficult to collect payments. The community can either&#13;
be given a very active role, with its attendant risks, or its&#13;
role can be kept to a minimum and cost recovery organized as a&#13;
purely administrative task.&#13;
*    An issue that began to emerge in Zambia at the time the&#13;
evaluation ended was that of project maintenance. There were&#13;
some indications that the community perceived maintenance to&#13;
be entirely the reponsibility of the Project administration or&#13;
the city government, with very little feeling of participant&#13;
responsibility for upkeep of public facilities (water taps,&#13;
drainage ditches, etc.). As with cost recovery, experience&#13;
suggests that the community must be involved in maintenance&#13;
considerations at a very early stage, rather than after&#13;
problems have already developed. It should be possible to&#13;
instill a sense of pride and proprietariness on the part of&#13;
the community so that its members will accept joint&#13;
responsibility with the government for maintenance. It is&#13;
essential to avoid creating either of two impressions: that&#13;
the government will solve all problems (a false promise local&#13;
politicians the world over cannot resist making), or that&#13;
families in poor areas will be expected to perform for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
themselves maintenance functions that are apparently provided&#13;
free to middle-income areas of the city.&#13;
7. Issues Related to the Construction Process&#13;
In general the construction process was very successful, with&#13;
most households demonstrating their ability to produce an adequate&#13;
dwelling unit in a relatively short period of time. The following were&#13;
some of the attendant observations and lessons.&#13;
*    A higher proportion of families than expected decided to hire&#13;
labor rather than build for themselves. This can be explained&#13;
partly by a much lower level of unemployment than expected&#13;
among project participants, and partly by the fact that most&#13;
families either lacked the skills to build their own house or&#13;
preferred to invest in skilled labor in order to guarantee a&#13;
better quality structure. Project design should provide for&#13;
both options. Families who wish to use their own labor should&#13;
be helped to do so (through plans and technical assistance),&#13;
but those who prefer to hire labor should also be encouraged&#13;
to do so. One provision for such encouragement might be to&#13;
permit part of the construction loan to be used for hiring&#13;
labor.&#13;
*    As noted earlier, mutual help should probably not be a&#13;
required part of the construction process, although it might&#13;
be offered as an option for those groups who are interested.&#13;
In several countries, including Kenya and El Salvador,&#13;
voluntary mutual help groups have proved an effective means of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
house construction (as opposed to the experience with infrastructure&#13;
installation in Zambia).&#13;
8. Issues Related to Income-Generating Project Components&#13;
Research has shown that, although the specific income-&#13;
generating components of the Lusaka Project did not have significant&#13;
quantitative impacts, the construction process itself generated a&#13;
significant demand for labor. In addition, the Project appears to have&#13;
increased rental income and income from food production, although in&#13;
neither case has it been possible to quantify the effect precisely. A&#13;
number of important considerations for furture projects emerged from the&#13;
Zambia experience:&#13;
*    Although subletting and the addition of rental space were&#13;
discouraged to avoid "landlordism", a high proportion of&#13;
households may have sublet part or all of their house. This&#13;
appears to have been particularly important as a source of&#13;
income for poorer families. Many projects have met with&#13;
difficulty in defining policy with regard to rentals and&#13;
sales. On the one hand, rentals are a potentially significant&#13;
way of increasing the income of poorer households, and thus&#13;
enhancing project affordability. On the other hand, there are&#13;
grounds for concern that poorer sectors will be exploited,&#13;
either by having to pay excessive rent, or by being forced out&#13;
of the project. In practice, it has proved impossible to&#13;
regulate subletting, although some reasonably effective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
controls have been placed on sales in sites and services&#13;
areas.&#13;
Although the appropriate policy will depend in part on the&#13;
social and political philosophy of a project's host country, it is&#13;
possible to suggest some general guidelines regarding rentals and sales:&#13;
*    Rental income is one of the few ways in which most projects&#13;
have been able to affect significantly the incomes of their&#13;
target populations. As long as measures can be taken to avoid&#13;
the worst abuses, subletting should be permitted. An inter-&#13;
esting example is the Dandora Project in Nairobi, where poorer&#13;
families are actively encouraged to sublet part of their house&#13;
and part of their construction loan may be used to make this&#13;
possible.&#13;
Although subletting should be permitted, households should&#13;
also be required to register the fact that they are renting&#13;
space, and should perhaps be required to pay a slightly higher&#13;
service charge to reflect the greater use of services and the&#13;
greater capital gain they will enjoy.&#13;
*    In sites and services projects, it will generally be approp-&#13;
riate to regulate sales during the first few years so as to&#13;
permit families to appreciate the value and benefits of their&#13;
new dwellings before they consider selling them. Selling&#13;
should not necessarily be prohibited, but should be subject to&#13;
special approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
*    In an upgrading project, selling should probably be permitted&#13;
with only minimal controls. However, some type of capital&#13;
gains tax should probably also be levied so that the local&#13;
government can recoup part of the value of any subsidies&#13;
included in the project.&#13;
9.   Issues Related to Project Evaluation&#13;
The Lusaka Project included both a monitoring and an&#13;
evaluation unit. The two units operated independently with relatively&#13;
little coordination of activities. Both proved to be useful to project&#13;
management, although there were a number of problems that arose in the&#13;
design and administration of various studies (See Chapter 1). Some&#13;
general conclusions about project evaluation can be drawn from the&#13;
Lusaka experience:&#13;
*    Evaluation activities have two distinct audiences.  The first&#13;
is project management, which requires mainly short- and&#13;
medium-range studies to help with the implementation of the&#13;
project in progress. The second comprises the national&#13;
planning agencies that are interested in longer-term and more&#13;
general studies which can help with the definition of future&#13;
urban shelter strategies. The two types of research should be&#13;
clearly separated.&#13;
*    Monitoring and evaluation should be considered as one inte-&#13;
grated system, rather than being conducted separately. When&#13;
they are separated, a number of important studies may not get&#13;
done because they do not fall clearly within the terms of&#13;
reference of either the monitoring or evaluation groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
*    The evaluation program should be designed initially to be very&#13;
simple and economical, so that it can be developed on a small&#13;
budget, without requiring large numbers of specialist&#13;
researchers. A Basic Evaluation System of this kind should be&#13;
closely tied to project development and planning cycles, and&#13;
should yield brief policy-related reports providing specific&#13;
answers to the problems managers face at different stages of&#13;
project development.&#13;
*    Longitudinal impact studies should normally not be included in&#13;
the intitial evaluation programs unless they can be conducted&#13;
independently by a national agency, such as the Ministry of&#13;
Planning.&#13;

PART I:   THE PROJECT AND ITS CONTEXT&#13;
CHAPTER ONE: THE PROJECT AND ITS CONTEXT&#13;
1.   The Scope of the Housing Problem&#13;
In December, 1974, The Government of the Republic of Zambia and&#13;
The World Bank signed a loan and project agreement (Loan 1057 - ZA)&#13;
designed to improve the living conditions of more than 200,000 urban&#13;
Zambians. When the Project began, Lusaka was facing an acute shelter&#13;
shortage. The rapid urbanization of the post-Independence decade created&#13;
the need for a new approach to the shelter problem. Due to its design and&#13;
level of services, public housing was unavailable to the poorest half of&#13;
the population, most of which was scattered around the periphery of the&#13;
city in illegal, unsafe, and unserviced shanty compounds. Between 1963&#13;
and 1974, the population of Lusaka more than tripled, rising from&#13;
123,000 to 401,000, an addition of 5,000 new households annually.&#13;
During the same period, the legal housing stock of Lusaka increased&#13;
by 19,434 units, less than 2,000 per year. As a result, the proportion of&#13;
the city's population living in unserviced squatter areas increased from&#13;
15% to 42%.&#13;
By 1974, the scale and intensity of the housing problem in&#13;
Lusaka had grown to such a level that incremental policies of minor&#13;
readjustment in the housing budget could no longer cope with it. To make&#13;
things worse, the Zambian economy in 1974 entered the most critical stage&#13;
of the post-Independence period. The price of copper, the resource&#13;
accounting for 45% of government revenue and about 95% of total foreign&#13;
exchange earnings, fell to a record low in the international market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Trade routes through Rhodesia and Zaire were closed, and a global&#13;
inflationary pressure, instigated by escalating oil prices, threatened to&#13;
erode further the purchasing power of the local currency. In the span of&#13;
one year, the current account balance indicated a drop from +48.5 million&#13;
Kwacha in 1974 to -392.5 million Kwacha in 1975. The impact of this&#13;
unprecedented economic crisis was soon felt in the housing sector.&#13;
Central Government subsidies for construction of low-cost houses by local&#13;
authorities were terminated. The local authorities were specifically&#13;
directed to stop all housing construction programs.&#13;
During the first ten years of Independence, prior to the World&#13;
Bank Project, the Lusaka City Council* had tried a housing policy based on&#13;
structural specifications, rather than on estimates of effective housing&#13;
demand. 1/ This policy resulted in the production of a small number of&#13;
units, all of which were too expensive for the majority of the population.&#13;
The observed effect of designing public housing to such high standards&#13;
was to skew the Lusaka City Council-s meagre resources toward the&#13;
higher income groups.&#13;
According to the second housing program of 1968-71, which had&#13;
a total budget of 9,498,000 Kwacha, the sum of 6,730,000 Kwacha was&#13;
1/   See R. Martin, "Housing in Lusaka," in Local Government in Zambia,&#13;
Nigel R. Hawkenworth, Ed., Lusaka City Council, 1974, p.58. Accord-&#13;
ing to Martin, a standard low-cost house during this period had&#13;
"large windows all around and a small porch at the front, and generally&#13;
one at the back as well. Besides having water borne sanitation,&#13;
usually with a conventional type WC, they also had electricity, and&#13;
often tarred road access. The inside of the houses were normally&#13;
plastered, and the ablutions included a shower room. The kitchen&#13;
was sometimes spacious enough to be used also as a dining room."&#13;
*    The names of several organizations changed during the period of the&#13;
study. The Lusaka City Council became the Lusaka Urban District&#13;
Council and the Ministry of Local Government and Housing became&#13;
the Provincial and Local Government Administration of the Office of&#13;
the Prime Minister. Throughout the text we use the title which was&#13;
current at the time referred to.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
allocated for building 2840 conventional houses, while only 1,630,000&#13;
Kwacha was provided for the servicing of 13,000 plots. Implementation&#13;
problems reduced the figures of actual achievement still further. By the&#13;
end of two housing programs (1965-67 and 1968-71), out of the target of&#13;
6790 conventional houses and 14,710 serviced plots, only 3,071 houses and&#13;
7,850 serviced plots had been completed. During the same time period, the&#13;
total number of houses in the illegal squatter areas increased from 7,500&#13;
to 26,300.&#13;
2. The World Bank Project as a Response to the Housing Crisis&#13;
The staggering scale and intensity of the housing problem in Lusaka&#13;
demanded a response of equal scale and intensity. The 42.1 million dollar&#13;
First Lusaka Urban Development Project, aided by a 20 million dollar loan&#13;
from The World Bank, promised by its scale and innovative approach to&#13;
provide this response. By virtue of its design and timing, the Project&#13;
held the potential for becoming a landmark for a new and more efficient&#13;
urban development and management system.&#13;
The Project-s most radical departure from accepted housing policy&#13;
was its emphasis on developing, rather than eradicating, existing squatter&#13;
settlements. The Project aimed at absorbing this marginal city population&#13;
into a coherent urban services system. It would offer its beneficiaries&#13;
formal leasehold titles for pieces of urban land, and such services as&#13;
piped water, paved roads, health clinics, and in some cases water-borne&#13;
sewerage. (Because the housing stock created by the Project cut across&#13;
existing standards, enactment of the program required special legislation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
whose effect has been a statutory end to "harassment" of the poor by&#13;
police, health officials, and planners, who had previously imposed the&#13;
higher standards. This, in itself, was an important accomplishment.)&#13;
The proposed Project included seven major components: acquisition&#13;
of land; provision of building materials loans; the upgrading of four&#13;
major squatter settlements; provision of some 4,400 plots with either&#13;
communal water supply and sanitation or individual water and sewer&#13;
connections (sites and services); construction of primary infrastructure,&#13;
including sewer and water mains, access roads, and a garbage collection&#13;
system; construction of community facilities, such as schools, markets,&#13;
and health centers; and provision of technical assistance. The innovative&#13;
assumption behind the Project's design was the idea that beneficiaries&#13;
would be given incentives to use their own and each other's labor in the&#13;
house construction and upgrading processes. A high level of community&#13;
involvement would be another distinguishing feature of this Project,&#13;
paralleling its provision of a complex service infrastructure, lacking in&#13;
so many comparable development efforts elsewhere.&#13;
3. Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project&#13;
The First Lusaka Upgrading and Sites and Services Project&#13;
was a type of development project new both to the World Bank and to the&#13;
Zambian Government. Among the program-s innovative aspects was a commit-&#13;
ment to conduct a long-term, systematic evaluation of its effects. With&#13;
50% of the necessary funding provided by the International Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Research Centre in Canada, and the rest provided by the Bank, an&#13;
Evaluation Unit was set up in Lusaka in 1975. A separate monitoring&#13;
unit, reporting directly to the Project Director, was established&#13;
within the HPU. 2/&#13;
The Evaluation Team was made institutionally distinct from&#13;
the Lusaka Housing Project Unit (the implementing agency) to ensure a&#13;
maximum of objectivity in its analyses. The Team was affiliated with the&#13;
Ministry of Local and Provincial Government(MLPG) which administered the&#13;
research grants. All the reports and documents produced by the Evaluation&#13;
Team had to be approved by a Steering Committee. This committee was&#13;
chaired by the Assistant Secretary of Housing from MLPG, and included&#13;
representatives of the Zambia National Housing Authority, the Zambia&#13;
National Building Society, The University of Zambia's Institute of&#13;
African Studies, the National Development Planning Commission, the&#13;
Development Bank of Zambia, the resident mission of the International&#13;
Labour Organization in Lusaka, the Lusaka Housing Project Unit, and the&#13;
American Friends Service Committee.&#13;
Though initially headed by a British expatriate with extensive&#13;
experience of Lusaka's housing problems, the major part of the Evaluation&#13;
Team's activity was guided by a Zambian researcher, aided by two research&#13;
associates and a full-time research assistant. (Ten full-time local&#13;
interviewers and a driver assisted in the collection of data.) The Urban&#13;
and Regional Economics Division of the World Bank's Development Economics&#13;

Department provided technical support, in fact as an internal "subcontractor"&#13;
to the responsible Urban Projects Department, and guided the research&#13;
designs to yield findings of maximum usefulness for the design of future&#13;
projects in Zambia and in other developing countries.&#13;
As lending for urban housing projects was a relatively&#13;
new practice for the Bank, it was thought important initially to assess&#13;
the impact of such projects at every level. Accordingly, in the appraisal&#13;
report of the Lusaka Project, the scope of evaluation was defined as "an&#13;
analysis of anticipated as well as unexpected effects of the project on&#13;
the individual household and on urban and regional social and economic&#13;
patterns." Because of the scale of the Lusaka Project, the diversitv&#13;
of its components, and the existence of a strong data base, it was&#13;
considered particularly appropriate for evaluation study. But perhaps the&#13;
most persuasive argument for the evaluation exercise, both before and&#13;
since the Project's inception, has been the possibility of using its&#13;
findings to form and review an on-going national urban shelter program&#13;
that will have strong government support.&#13;
The research design combined a longitudinal survey repeated&#13;
at 3 points in time in George, with a number of cross-sectional studies.&#13;
The longitudinal studies were designed to evaluate project impact on&#13;
participating families, whilst the cross-sectional studies were designed&#13;
to evaluate project performance and to study issues such as affordability,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
cost recovery and house construction. A detailed explanation of the&#13;
research design was prepared by the LHPET in 1977 3/ and this was&#13;
followed with a number of modifications.&#13;
Between 1975 and 1980, the Evaluation Team prepared a total&#13;
of 31 evaluation reports 4/ many of which were helpful to management&#13;
in the design and execution of different aspects of the project. The&#13;
reports which proved to be of most immediate utility to management&#13;
were those dealing with problems of affordability and cost recovery,&#13;
the operation of self-help and mutual-help construction activities,&#13;
selection procedures for sites and services, causes of drop-outs&#13;
from the projects, land use, and the evaluation of the employment&#13;
generation components.&#13;
Although the end product of the evaluation exercise proved to&#13;
be useful, the evaluation process encountered a considerable number of&#13;
operational and methodological difficulties. To conduct a rigorous&#13;
impact evaluation it is necessary to have a control group against which&#13;
to gauge the significance of the changes observed in the project areas.&#13;
The control group originally included in the research design was dispersed&#13;
due to flooding, and this restricted the types of impact analysis which could&#13;
be conducted. Further difficulties were caused by problems of matching&#13;
families who moved to overspill areas with the same families interviewed&#13;
in the upgrading areas before they moved. In the process of moving,&#13;
many families went to unnumbered plots which made it very difficult&#13;

to match the families. This again limited some of the types of analysis&#13;
which could be done. 5/ From the point of view of developing a national&#13;
research capacity, the biggest problem was undoubtedly the absence at&#13;
the time the evaluation began of statistical packages on Zambian computers&#13;
for the analysis of sample surveys. The attempt to develop a local&#13;
statistical package was not successful and although some of the initial&#13;
analysis was done in Lusaka 6/ after considerable delays most of the&#13;
data had to be taken to Washington for analysis. 7/ The delays caused by&#13;
the lack of access to computer facilities resulted in deterioration and&#13;
disorganization of the earlier data sets, and seriously reduced the possib-&#13;
ilities for longitudinal impact analysis. As a result, much of the statistical&#13;
analysis is based on cross-sectional data collected in 1980. None of&#13;
these problems were unique to Zambia, and although they limited the scope&#13;
of the long-term impact analysis, they did not seriously detract from&#13;
the practical utility of the evaluation exercise to program management.&#13;
This final report is a selective synthesis of the evaluation&#13;
findings of these studies, along with some further analysis based&#13;
on up-to-date data sets. The views of government officials in Zambia on&#13;
Project experience and on the strengths and weaknesses of various Project&#13;
components have been added to give a further qualitative dimension to the&#13;
analysis. This report provides the World Bank and the Government of&#13;
Zambia with a record of lessons learned from the First Lusaka Urban&#13;

PART II: PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION&#13;
CHAPTER TWO: PHYSICAL DESIGN&#13;
1. Criteria for the Choice of Lusaka as the Project Location&#13;
At the time of the Project's design stage, Lusaka was the largest&#13;
and fastest-growing city in Zambia, and had the most pressing urban&#13;
shelter problems. The available relevent information on Lusaka was much&#13;
greater than that pertaining to other urban areas. This information&#13;
included aerial photography, socio-economic, and physical surveys, even&#13;
of unauthorized dwelling areas. The existing "Lusaka 2000" master plan of&#13;
the city, according to which project areas were selected, provided a&#13;
satisfactory blueprint for an efficient future urban growth pattern. The&#13;
process of institution-building was foreseen to be relatively easier&#13;
in Lusaka than in other cities because related organizations, such&#13;
as the National Housing Authority were already located there. Finally,&#13;
location of the Project in the capital city would maximize its effects as&#13;
a demonstration of the advanced development principles that distinguished&#13;
it from other urban shelter programs.&#13;
Evaluation Findings&#13;
The general concensus among policy makers in Zambia is that the&#13;
choice of Lusaka was an appropriate one. Editorials in the national&#13;
newspapers support this view.&#13;
The demonstration effect of the Project on national and international&#13;
observers has also been significant. According to the monthly reports of&#13;
the Housing Project Unit-s Communications Section, more than fifty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
delegations from various countries in Africa, Central America, and&#13;
Europe have so far visited the project sites. 1/&#13;
Vital parts of project implementation, such as land acquisition,&#13;
would probably have been slowed and complicated considerably had it been&#13;
necessary for project management to communicate with central and local&#13;
government agencies from another city. 2/&#13;
Less positively, the investment of 26.5 million Kwacha in the&#13;
city of Lusaka may not have been supportive of the national spatial&#13;
policy of encouraging growth away from the "line of rail." According to&#13;
Table 2.1, between 1974 and 1980, about a third of the total national&#13;
investment in housing and related infrastructure has been concentrated in&#13;
Lusaka. 3/ This has created some resentment on the part of other city and&#13;
township councils, which are finding it difficult to generate their own&#13;
revenues to tackle their local housing problems.&#13;
2.   Criteria for the Choice of Project Sites Within Lusaka&#13;
The Project upgrading areas, Chawama, George, and Chaisa/&#13;
Chipata were chosen because of their relative proximity to existing&#13;
sources of employment, public facilities, and planned or existing&#13;
1/ Lusaka Housing Project Newsletter, March 1980.&#13;
2/ Land acquisition in fact proved to be the major cause of project&#13;
delays. The delays would have been even longer had it not been&#13;
for the direct contact between the HPU and the Commissioner of&#13;
Lands. This would have been even more difficult if the project&#13;
had not been in Lusaka.&#13;

utility services. Conformity with Lusaka's master plan, and the suit-&#13;
ability of sub-soil conditions for eventual sewer installation were also&#13;
major considerations in the selection of these areas. Socio-economic&#13;
surveys of these settlement areas further indicated that households in&#13;
Chawama, George, and Chaisa/Chipata could afford to pay their share of&#13;
the development costs.&#13;
The locations for "basic" and "normal" sites and services&#13;
schemes were chosen to accord with the Lusaka master plan. ("Basic" plots&#13;
were to be supplied with pit latrines and communal water supply, "normal"&#13;
plots with individual water and sewer connections.) Accessibility to the&#13;
center of town and the costs of off-site infrastructure were also considered&#13;
in the selection of Sites 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.&#13;
Evaluation Findings&#13;
The choice of Chawama, George, and Chaisa/Chipata was logical in&#13;
that, as of 1974, these four areas comprised 63% of Lusaka's total&#13;
squatter population, a population spread geographically over fourteen&#13;
settlement areas.&#13;
The choice of George, previously known as "Kapwepwe Compound"&#13;
and later "Mwaziona," 4/ gave rise to some unusual problems of land&#13;
acquisition. Here, as at other upgrading sites, project design called for&#13;
preparation of residential plots adjacent to the upgraded area (called&#13;
overspill areas) for households displaced by project works in the squatter&#13;

settlement itself. Acquisition of land for the overspill areas was&#13;
delayed by the fact that the exact nature of land holdings in George was&#13;
difficult to determine. In the project proposal prepared by the National&#13;
Housing Authority, land acquisition was not foreseen as a problem,&#13;
primarily because of the Lands Acquisition Act of 1970.&#13;
Although acquisition of land for development purposes was&#13;
theoretically possible within two weeks, in reality the process some-&#13;
times took up to 3 years. Resistance from previous users of the land&#13;
also caused further delays. The contractor in Site 7 had to suspend work&#13;
for four months because of violent opposition from the residents who&#13;
claimed they had established a legitimate farming cooperative on the&#13;
site. The problems arose not so much from the way in which the particular&#13;
sites were selected but from the unexpected delays in land acquisition. 5/&#13;
With the exception of Site 7, which is relatively inaccessible from&#13;
the city center, all the other sites and services areas have attracted&#13;
large numbers of applicants because of their favorable locations. As late&#13;
as July, 1980, nearly 800 applications were filed for the 200 plots to be&#13;
allocated in Site 6.&#13;
Unlike earlier sites and services schemes, such as Mandavu-&#13;
Marrapodi and Mutendere, which were located at the city periphery,&#13;
the locations of the Project sites have resulted in the areas being&#13;
integrated, physically and functionally, with other housing districts of&#13;
the city. This is the first instance in which the intent of the 1968&#13;
circular recommending integrated housing has been fulfilled.&#13;
5/   See Chapter Five for a more detailed discussion of land acquisition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
In spite of its special position, in terms of easy access&#13;
to the city center and other social facilities, Site 6 turned out to&#13;
have problems that significantly delayed the development process. Certain&#13;
parts of the Site were found to have a water table (ground water level)&#13;
too high for building purposes. The high water table was not foreseen at&#13;
the design stage because it was the result of an unusually heavy rainfall&#13;
in 1978. 6/ It resulted in reduction of the total number of plots to be&#13;
allocated from 930 to 400. The additional cost of developing Site 6 had&#13;
to be shared by all six sites in order to keep the monthly charges at&#13;
Site 6 as low as possible. Despite this effort, Site 6 proved to be&#13;
too expensive for the poorest applicants.&#13;
The close promixity of Site 5 (basic S/S) and the George&#13;
overspill area also accounted for another unplanned occurrence, the&#13;
tendency of low-income families to move from Site 5 to the George over-&#13;
spill, where they obtained a lower level of services (one tap per 25&#13;
families as compared with one for every 4) but at a lower payment rate.&#13;
3. Design Criteria Determining Plot Sizes in Overspill and&#13;
Sites and Services Areas&#13;
Circular No. 59/66 from the Ministry of Local Government&#13;
and Housing set plot size for sites and services schemes at 324 M2&#13;
(plus or minus 10%) for both basic and normal plots. The Bank, concerned&#13;
that a large plot size would lead to increased servicing costs and&#13;
eventual urban sprawl, considered a standard plot of 324 M2 to be&#13;
larger than optimal. At the time of negotiations, the Zambian Government&#13;
6/   From personal interview with the National Housing Authority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
agreed to review the experience in overspill areas, where plot size&#13;
was expected to be about 210 M2, with an eye to revising its standards&#13;
if the smaller size plots proved adequate for low-income households.7/&#13;
Determination of plot size was guided by a compromise between the need to&#13;
encourage beneficiaries planting of gardens and building of extra rooms&#13;
for rental and the need to limit servicing costs.&#13;
Evaluation Findings&#13;
Some overspill plots in the Lusaka Project are smaller than&#13;
the projected 210 M2, mainly because of the growth of the upgrading&#13;
areas since the latest aerial survey prior to project implementation.&#13;
Sufficient land was not available adjacent to the expanded settlements&#13;
to allow for the planned plot size. Further, due to the instructions&#13;
of the Road Planning Group, the local group that decided the layout of&#13;
the upgraded areas, more households than initially planned for had to be&#13;
resettled in the overspill areas.&#13;
Table 2.2 indicates the sizes of plots in low-cost housing&#13;
areas of Lusaka, in sites and services areas designed by the Lusaka City&#13;
Council before the World Bank-s involvement, and in those administered by&#13;
the Lusaka Housing Project Unit. The Table shows that contrary to the&#13;
widespread belief that HPU plots are unusually small, in fact the sizes&#13;
of plots in almost all previous sites and services schemes are smaller&#13;
than those provided by the Lusaka Housing Project.&#13;
7/ In December 1975, preparing for the U.N. Conference on Human&#13;
Settlements, the National Participation Committee of Zambia,&#13;
headed by a representative of the Ministry of Local Government&#13;
and Housing, agreed upon 210 square meters as a minimum&#13;
standard plot size.&#13;

Table 2.3 shows the proportion of families in several project&#13;
sites who responded to an Evaluation Team survey in 1976 by indicating&#13;
satisfaction with plot size. The figures show that with the exception of&#13;
George, where the average plot size is only 135 square meters the majority&#13;
of participants are satisfied with the size of their plot.&#13;

Site 1 (normal s/s)            324.0                  90.0%&#13;
A number of general conclusions can be drawn from the studies. Firstly,&#13;
families vary in their preferred plot size, with a high proportion being&#13;
satisfied with plots considerably smaller than had been originally&#13;
expected. This suggests that the projects should offer a range of plot&#13;
sizes and prices.&#13;
Secondly the size of the plot does not seem to be a constraint&#13;
on the size of the house. Most houses are relatively small and additional&#13;
land is used for growing food rather than for expanding the house. Given&#13;
the problems of malnutrition, the growing of food should be encouraged,&#13;
but larger plots for this purpose should probably only be provided on the&#13;
periphery where the cost of land is lower.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Thirdly, as Zambia is still in the early stages of urbanization,&#13;
it can be expected that land densities will begin to increase. Future&#13;
projects should offer smaller plots in central locations whilst continuing&#13;
to offer larger plots on the periphery. The survey results suggest that&#13;
centrally located plots could have about 150 M2, whilst peripheral&#13;
plots could offer up to 300 M2. For the same reason it is not advisable&#13;
to use voluntary overspill as a means of dedensification in central locations.&#13;
If one family wishes to move to a larger plot further from the center of&#13;
the city, their vacated land should be sold to another family rather than&#13;
taken over by the family already sharing the plot.&#13;
4. Proposed Floors Plans: Design Assumptions&#13;
Householders in the overspill and sites and services areas were&#13;
offered four different types of floor plan for building their houses. 8/&#13;
These floor plans were for core houses, usually comprising two rooms and&#13;
a kitchen, that could gradually be expanded by the addition of extra&#13;
rooms, some of which might generate rental income as well as provide more&#13;
living space. Building material loans were extended to participant&#13;
families on the assumption that the total floor area of a core house&#13;
would be between 21.5 M2 and 24.0 M2.  The designs allowed for&#13;
expansion of a core house to a floor area of between 80 M2 and 90 M2,&#13;
still leaving substantial plot footage for vegetable gardening or other&#13;
uses. Figure 2.1 illustrates the four basic floor plans.&#13;

Evaluation Findings 9/&#13;
A survey of thie households in Site 5 (basic sites and services)&#13;
indicated that prior to Mtay, 1980, 74% were living in core houses&#13;
with floor areas ranging between 11 M2 and 24 M2. Forty percent&#13;
of the households had built one-room core houses, and 42% had built&#13;
two room core houses according to floor plans supplied by the Housing&#13;
Project Unit. The remainLng 18% of families in this area had already&#13;
expanded their core houses to three, four, or five rooms.&#13;
Visual observation of core houses in the various sites and&#13;
services project areas indicated that the majority of families preferred&#13;
to build a "Type 2a" core house, the one among the four types having the&#13;
largest frontage.&#13;
Field team leaders and building assistants on the Project&#13;
reported that -most beneficiaries were satisfied with the choice of&#13;
proposed core house floor plans. The design modification suggested by&#13;
beneficiaries responses was a space for a verandah, even at the core&#13;
house stage. Some householders had already made modifications so as to&#13;
incorporate a verandah into their core houses.&#13;
In conclusion we can say that plot size has not been a major&#13;
constraint and in fact project plot options are realistic. The only&#13;
design change which is suggested is to include a verandah.&#13;

5. Building Materials Loans: Assumptions&#13;
Estimation of the appropriate amounts for building material&#13;
loans was guided by the assumption that participating households would&#13;
improve or build their houses with sundried bricks or soil cement blocks.&#13;
In June 1973, it was possible to build a substantial three-room sundried&#13;
brick house with concrete block foundation, internal plaster, wide roof&#13;
overhangs and a floor area of 24 M2 for 241 Kwacha. 10/ On this basis,&#13;
resettled households in Chawama were provided loans of 250 Kwacha each.&#13;
Evaluation Findings&#13;
Three studies conducted by the Evaluation Team between 1976 and&#13;
1978 have shown that participant households opted almost universally for&#13;
the use of concrete blocks, rather than the cheaper sundried bricks or&#13;
soil cement blocks in making their house improvements. 11/ More recent&#13;
surveys (1979-1980) in Site 5 (basic sites and services) and Site 1&#13;
(normal sites and services) show that 92.5% of the houses in Site 5 and&#13;
89.5% of those in Site 1 are constructed of concrete blocks.&#13;
In evaluating the greater than expected use of concrete blocks&#13;
and expensive materials in general, there are two different sets of&#13;
factors which must be taken into account. On the one hand, the higher&#13;
than expected quality is a positive outcome as it proves that the&#13;
project has improved the quality of housing more than expected. On&#13;
the other hand there is the concern that increased costs might produce&#13;

affordability problems for some of the poorer families. During the&#13;
period from 1973-1977 it was estimated that the average cost of a&#13;
house in George was approximately K107 12/ and that most families&#13;
were reducing their expenditure on house investments. The slow down was&#13;
in part due to satisfaction with the small house already built and in&#13;
part to the worsening economic situation which forced a general cut-back&#13;
in expenses. During the same period the HPU was estimating that even a&#13;
house made of sundried bricks should cost more than twice the average&#13;
amount being paid by families in George. The question must therefore be&#13;
asked as to whether the decision by families to invest in much more&#13;
expensive building materials was a rational decision on their part, or&#13;
was it to some extent imposed by the design of the project?&#13;
There are several possible reasons why the majority of project&#13;
participants preferred concrete blocks to sundried or soil-cement bricks.&#13;
First, only the more expensive materials were available from the material&#13;
store. A family which wished to use the cheaper materials could not use&#13;
the loan to buy these materials elsewhere so would either have to make&#13;
them or arrange other sources of finance for their purpose. Second,&#13;
the design of the project put families under considerable pressure to&#13;
move to the overspill areas. Their previous house was demolished to&#13;
make way for essential construction and dedensification and the family&#13;
was obliged to live in a temporary shelter on the new plot until their&#13;
hew house was completed. As the production of sundried bricks or earth&#13;
cement blocks takes a considerable time, there was a strong incentive&#13;

for the family to buy ready made materials so as to complete and occupy&#13;
the new house in the shortest possible time. Third, the technical&#13;
assistance provided to families to help with the making of blocks was&#13;
not always adequate. Account was not taken of the different soil&#13;
characteristics in each area, and many of the bricks made were not&#13;
of a very high quality.&#13;
There were also a number of positive reasons for preferring&#13;
higher quality materials. First, a survey of George in 1976 showed&#13;
that 98% of families were planning to rebuild in permanent materials. 13/&#13;
Interviews with field team leaders confirm an eagerness on the part&#13;
of most families to take advantage of the opportunity to improve the&#13;
quality of their houses and to integrate them visually and in terms&#13;
of quality with traditional Lusaka housing standards. 14/ Second,&#13;
it was found that the median monthly rent in 1978 for rooms made of&#13;
concrete blocks was 10 to 11 Kwacha, compared with a median rent of&#13;
5 to 7 Kwacha for rooms with walls of sundried brick. 15/ This would&#13;
mean that after about 2 years a family renting out a room could probably&#13;
recoup the additional 100 Kwacha invested in the more permanent materials.&#13;
Third, if technical assistance has to be provided in the production of&#13;
sundried bricks, and if the cost of this assistance has to be built into&#13;

materials will be considerably less than it at first appears. 16/&#13;
6. Design Standards for the Primary Infrastructure&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
The level of primary infrastructure services provided varied&#13;
according to the type of development going on in each project area. In&#13;
the water supply component, one standpipe was to be provided for every&#13;
twenty five households in upgrading and adjacent overspill areas. Basic&#13;
sites and services schemes would include one standpipe for every four&#13;
households, and in normal sites and services areas, every household would&#13;
have an individual water connection.&#13;
Road Works&#13;
Many urban improvement schemes comparable to the Lusaka Project&#13;
have made the significant omission of failing to provide transport&#13;
connections between project sites and the rest of the city. So, in&#13;
conjunction with the Lusaka Master Plan, the Lusaka Project was to&#13;
include off-site road works. This Project component entailed construction&#13;
of extension roads and connectors to serve Sites 1, 3, 4, and 5, and&#13;
construction of local access roads to Chawama and Chaisa Upgrading areas.&#13;
The road works were further to include bitumen surfacing of 16 kilometers&#13;
of roads designated as bus routes within project areas.&#13;
16/ In the Kafue project, which is often cited as an example of the&#13;
economies produced by the use of self-made bricks, a considerable&#13;
amount of technical assistance was provided free by Care and the&#13;
American Friends Service Committee. If the cost of this assistance&#13;
had been charged to families the cost of the materials would have&#13;
increased considerably.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Security lighting&#13;
Since the usability of roads by pedestrian traffic partly depends on&#13;
their nighttime safety, plans for the primary infrastructure called for&#13;
installation of street lighting on major access roads, and security&#13;
lighting in project areas proper. Lighting would be to the standard of&#13;
two single lamps per hectare in upgrading areas and five per hectare in&#13;
sites and services locations.&#13;
Sewerage&#13;
The normal sites and services areas were to be provided with&#13;
water-borne sewerage systems, including the laying of 4 kilometers&#13;
of secondary sewer, 10 kilometers of trunk sewer, and the building&#13;
of stabilization ponds and two small pumping stations with rising&#13;
mains. The overspill and basic sites and services areas would provide&#13;
individual pit latrines for each household. The upgraded areas were&#13;
expected to retain a combination of shared and individual pit latrines.&#13;
Garbage removal&#13;
To facilitate garbage disposal, all households in the upgraded&#13;
overspill and sites and services areas were to be provided with dustbins&#13;
to be shared by 5 families (to be replaced every four years). The Project&#13;
design called for the purchase of 8 mechanical compaction trucks, 1 skid&#13;
lift truck, 5 skids, and 1 bulldozer to aid the Lusaka City council in&#13;
extending refuse collection service to all project areas.&#13;
Evaluation Findings&#13;
At this stage of project implementation, with much infrastructure&#13;
work still to be completed, it would be premature to claim to present&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
definitive evaluations of these components. 17/ However, responses of&#13;
project participants in some of the upgraded and sites and services areas&#13;
offer some initial perspective.&#13;
Water supply&#13;
Responses to a survey conducted by the LHPET in George upgraded&#13;
area in February, 1980, indicate that 86.7% of the households there&#13;
are satisfied with the piped water supply (communal standpipe for 25&#13;
families). In Site 5, a basic sites and services situation, a LHPET&#13;
survey done in May, 1980, found that 81.3% of the households are satisfied&#13;
with present water supply arrangements (standpipe for every 4 families).&#13;
Here, as in the George area, the primary reason cited for dissatisfaction&#13;
is the practice of turning off water in cases of default by one or more&#13;
families.&#13;
In Site 1, a normal sites and services area with individual con-&#13;
nections, 98% of participants surveyed indicated their satisfaction with&#13;
the water supply system. Eighty-six percent were also satisfied with the&#13;
existing monthly water charges, despite the fact that most (70%) had not&#13;
previously had to pay for water. 18/&#13;
Road Construction&#13;
No systematic survey has yet been made to find project participants&#13;
responses to design and construction of extension and access roads. How-&#13;
ever, some general observations based on field experience can be made.&#13;
17/ As of April, 1980, 20% to 25% of the infrastructure was still&#13;
being completed. The main causes of delays have been land&#13;
acquisition problems, contractors' liquidity problems, and the&#13;
difficulties of obtaining machinery, spare parts, and building&#13;
materials.&#13;
18/ However, at the time 35% of the families were at least 2 months&#13;
in arrears with payment of service charges (Table 9.5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
As a result of access roads having been built in Chawama,&#13;
demand for travel between Chawama and the city center has increased&#13;
significantly. Demand for travel on that route has more than doubled. 19/&#13;
Although there is no firm evidence, observation suggests&#13;
there may be two further benefits from the improved roads. Firstly,&#13;
because the new tarred roads are capable of absorbing heavy loads,&#13;
it seems that retail shops in Chawama can now stock large quantities&#13;
of essential goods that are typically delivered by heavy trucks from&#13;
the center of town.&#13;
Secondly, provision of good roads seems to have encouraged many&#13;
employers to provide office transport for their employees residing&#13;
in Chawama. 20/ Even residents of Mutendere, the most successful sites&#13;
and services scheme implemented prior to the Lusaka Project, still do not&#13;
enjoy this service as access roads to the area are not yet paved.&#13;
Despite the utility of the roads in several areas there has been&#13;
a deterioration of the roads and a need for regular maintenance. Many&#13;
officials believe the original design standards should have been higher.&#13;
Street lighting&#13;
The street lighting system provided was designed to a lower level than&#13;
that agreed at Appraisal and this has caused some dissatisfaction. Local&#13;
councillors have complained on behalf of Chawama residents that the lamp&#13;
fixtures provided do not spread&#13;

light over wide areas, as they should. 21/ (Chawama was the only project&#13;
site where installation of lighting had been completed when this report was&#13;
prepared.) Local leadership seminars indicate that a majority of residents do&#13;
not consider that the present street lighting system has increased security&#13;
in the districts where most thefts and burglaries occur. Most feel that the&#13;
distance between street lamps is too great and their wattage too small, and&#13;
that the lighting scheme favors households that live close to main roads. 22/&#13;
Sewerage&#13;
Water-borne sewerage systems for the normal sites and services&#13;
areas (Sites 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7) are still under construction. But&#13;
surveys of households in several project areas give an indication of&#13;
beneficiaries responses to the design of project sanitation systems.&#13;
In George, where 43% of households have their own pit latrines&#13;
and 52% share theirs with others, 58% of respondents indicated their&#13;
general satisfaction with sanitary arrangements. Out of the 42% who&#13;
reported dissatisfaction with the existing level of facilities, only&#13;
4% advocated flush toilets as a preferred form of improvement. Overuse&#13;
and unhygenic conditions of pit latrines were cited as the principal&#13;
reasons for dissatisfaction.&#13;
A May, 1980, LHPET survey in Site 5 (basic s/s) found 97% of&#13;
the households there satisfied with individual pit latrines, though 75%&#13;
expressed the wish to have flush toilets in the future.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
In Site 1 (normal s/s), where households are currently using&#13;
pit latrines because the water-borne sewerage system is still under&#13;
construction, 73.7% of families found the present facilities adequate.&#13;
Thirty-one percent of the households also indicated that they will still use&#13;
the existing pit latrines even after completion of the water-borne system.&#13;
This finding may suggest the need to review the desirability of water-&#13;
borne sewerage systems in future projects, as they are expensive to install&#13;
and the demand for them is not clearly established. When asked about the&#13;
majoT reasons for their decision to move to Site 1, 81% of the families there&#13;
said that the provision of water-borne sewerage was not a high priority with&#13;
them.&#13;
In conclusion it would seem that there is a high level of satisfaction&#13;
with a well functioning pit latrine sanitary system. There does not&#13;
appears to be a pressing demand from participants for water-borne&#13;
sewerage. This suggests that an improved pit latrine system might be&#13;
an economical design option for future projects trying to benefit from&#13;
the Lusaka experience.23/   Care must be taken in the interpretation of&#13;
these findings as the advantages of the water-borne sewerage systems are&#13;
mainly felt at the city rather than the individual family level. A pit&#13;
latrine may be satisfactory to the family but may create long term health&#13;
problems and additional costs for the city.&#13;
23/ An Urban Sanitation Survey by the National Housing Authority&#13;
in July, 1979, concluded that installation and maintenance of&#13;
water closets or aqua privies were mostly to be provided to&#13;
low-income households in Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Garbage Collection&#13;
Management meeting records indicate that garbage collection&#13;
has been a problematic issue since January, 1978, when refuse removal&#13;
officially began in Chawama. Since then, it has become a matter of&#13;
increasing significance to the viability of the Project, as many officials&#13;
believe that the quality of this service affects the rate of cost recovery.&#13;
Except for a recent LHPET study that attempted to assess the ability of&#13;
the Lusaka City Council to maintain project areas, no work has yet been&#13;
done specifically to evaluate this particular component of project&#13;
design. 24/ However, some general observations may be made by drawing&#13;
upon various surveys that have dealt indirectly with the garbage collection&#13;
issue. 251&#13;
The Lusaka Urban Development Project is a capital project,&#13;
meaning that its design does not incorporate detailed guidelines for&#13;
aspects of project maintenance, such as garbage removal. The Project&#13;
design merely calls for the purchase of dustbins and-other equipment to&#13;
facilitate the garbage collection process for the Lusaka City Council.&#13;
Inadequate briefing at the early stages of project implementation seems&#13;
to have led to the misconception among beneficiaries that their monthly&#13;
service charges cover the cost of garbage collection rather than just the&#13;
facilities for it.26/ In fact, the monthly charges do not provide for&#13;

26/ According to a LHPET survey, November, 1979, Chawama residents&#13;
believed they were paying 1 Kwacha for water, 1 Kwacha for&#13;
electricity, and 1 Kwacha for garbage collection.&#13;

garbage collection which is supposed to be sustained by the City Council's&#13;
General Rate Fund, according to Project design. 27/&#13;
Monitoring reports show that the primary obstacle to garbage&#13;
removal in Chawama, the first Project area, was considered to have been an&#13;
inadequate provision of a system of inner access roads. This prevented&#13;
garbage trucks from reaching the inner areas and consequently garbage was not&#13;
collected. In fact the original design intended that residents should carry&#13;
their dustbins to hard-standings on roads accessible to trucks. This point&#13;
does not seem to have been made clear in the community briefings, hence&#13;
residents expected garbage to be collected from in front of each house. It&#13;
is also not clear whether the design was understood or accepted by the&#13;
Project Staff as the Engineering Division of HPU explored the possibility of&#13;
constructing inner access roads, and only decided not to as the estimated&#13;
cost of K159,000 was considered too high. Further problems were also caused&#13;
by the fact that the timing of the provision of bins was not well coordinated&#13;
with the acquisition of garbage collection trucks, and that the bins provided&#13;
were not suitable for the system envisaged.&#13;
A long term potential problem is that the Project has created&#13;
a demand for new services, in this case garbage collection, without&#13;
providing the resources to continue financing the service. In terms of&#13;
Project design, the provision of six garbage compaction trucks has proved&#13;
inadequate to enhance the performance of the Lusaka City Council's&#13;
existing refuse removal facilities. Some institutional gaps in Project&#13;
design with respect to refuse removal operations seem to be the primary&#13;

reason for irregular service. The monitoring report cited earlier indicated&#13;
that only half of the LCC's fleet of refuse vehicles are in working&#13;
condition at any time.&#13;
7. Community Facilities&#13;
Design Specifications&#13;
Table 2.4 summarizes the design specifications for the Project-s&#13;
proposed provision of 17 markets, 10 materials stores, 17 multi-purpose&#13;
centers, 11 demonstration houses, and 3 health clinics. The Project was&#13;
also supposed to supply some 20 primary schools to serve 9,600 students&#13;
and employ 200 teachers. According to the Project agreement, the World&#13;
Bank's Third Education Project (Loan 900ZA) was to supervise construction&#13;
of the primary schools for the Ministry of Education.&#13;
Evaluation Findings&#13;
As of October, 1980, the following community facilities&#13;
had been completed: 8 schools, 6 multi-purpose community centers,&#13;
3 markets, and 9 material stores. No health clinics had been completed as&#13;
of that date. Delays in implementation of the remaining facilities were&#13;
caused by sharp cost escalations, particularly for building materials,&#13;
which meant that original funds were inadequate. Additional funds have&#13;
been approved to complete the community centers, clinics and lighting.&#13;
All the schools will be built because they have been transferred to the&#13;
budget of the Third Education Project.&#13;

Markets&#13;
Findings to date suggest that the inclusion of markets in&#13;
Project community facilities may have been a design error. A joint&#13;
study of six Lusaka markets by the LHPET and the University of Zambia's&#13;
Urban Community Research Unit observed that markets tend to develop&#13;
spontaneously and gradually to improve themselves. 28/ Construction of new&#13;
markets in urban projects may introduce dependence into what is already a&#13;
relatively dynamic and informal business sector.&#13;
Markets in Lusaka have developed organically over the years&#13;
and have organized themselves into cooperatives with a keen sense of&#13;
local control provided by officials of the United National Independence&#13;
Party. Markets established by the HPU, on the other hand, were turned&#13;
over to the City Council for administration, and this seems to have&#13;
discouraged local initiative and encouraged centralized control by the&#13;
LCC which has yet to develop a coherent policy for market operation.&#13;
Controversy between the LCC and the local leadership that&#13;
wants to form its own cooperatives has delayed the allocation of market&#13;
stalls. As a result, the market built by the HPU in Nyerere, Chawama, is&#13;
significantly underutilized at present, although the close proximity of&#13;
this market to the main market in Chawama may also help to explain its&#13;
disuse. Discussions with officials in Lusaka suggest that instead of&#13;
focussing on the construction of physical facilities for markets, Project&#13;
design might better have set aside portions of land within project sites,&#13;
and let communities develop their own structures. Additional efforts to&#13;

Assistance, " LHPET Working Paper No. 37, 1979.&#13;

promote the growth of market activity should be concentrated on easing&#13;
the legal and financial constraints that have discouraged would-be&#13;
marketeers in Lusaka in recent years.&#13;
Materials Stores&#13;
Thefts and armed robberies in project materials stores have&#13;
raised questions about their appropriate location and the security&#13;
aspects of their design. According to the HPU's Chief of Finance and&#13;
Procurement, almost 2% of the total building materials stock procured by&#13;
the HPU had been stolen as of May, 1980. The initial design of building&#13;
materials stores specified their enclosure with six foot high fences.&#13;
During the past four years, the design has been altered at least three&#13;
times to accomodate enclosure walls of increasing height. Security&#13;
problems to date suggest that in future Projects on the Lusaka model,&#13;
the centralization of material stores should be considered. While a&#13;
central materials depot would mean that some beneficiaries would have to&#13;
travel greater distances to obtain materials, it would also mean substantial&#13;
cost savings through the elimination of other store structures, each of&#13;
which would cost 14,000 to 20,000 Kwacha to build. A further increase in&#13;
security might result if a central materials store were located in an&#13;
area busy with community activity.&#13;
Community Centers&#13;
Since the essence of the Lusaka Project was to encourage&#13;
self-reliance on the part of project participants, in retrospect it&#13;
might have been better to leave the construction of multi-purpose&#13;
community centers to area residents. Community centers built by the HPU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
(at an average cost of 15,500 Kwacha) are currently underutilized.&#13;
Consistent with traditional Zambian culture, men, women, and children&#13;
prefer not to interact in the contained spatial context such as the&#13;
community centers provide. These structures are now being used predomi-&#13;
nantly as pre-school facilities. If the planning of community centers had&#13;
been left to the residents themselves, designs and structures might have&#13;
evolved over time to meet the needs peculiar to the community. Residents&#13;
would more likely have appreciated and maintained structures they had&#13;
created with specific needs in mind. At present, vandalism is a problem&#13;
plaguing most of the community centers built by the HPU. 29/&#13;
Though the design of primary schools has not been evaluated&#13;
by LHPET, general observations based on local UNIP meetings and public&#13;
reactions registered in national newspapers indicate general satisfaction&#13;
on the part of project residents. Total enrollment has increased signif-&#13;
icantly, and the spatial distribution of the schools has proved to be&#13;
efficient.&#13;

CHAPTER THREE: PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
This chapter describes and evaluates the organizational structure&#13;
set up to implement the First Lusaka Urban Development Project. Administration&#13;
of this Project has been a complex process because of the Project's wide&#13;
range of design options, the large number of beneficiaries involved, the&#13;
difficulty of anticipating practical implementation problems, and the&#13;
number of activities requiring inter-agency coordination. The analysis of&#13;
Project administration focuses on the Housing Project Unit's establishment&#13;
as a semi-autonomous agency, on the organizational linkages between the&#13;
HPU and project area communities, and on the internal structure of the&#13;
HPU itself.&#13;
1.   Establishment of the Housing Project Unit&#13;
The scale of the Lusaka Project required an implementing agency&#13;
free from most of the constraints affecting the Lusaka City Council's&#13;
activities. The poor record of the LCC in implementing past sites and&#13;
services projects was considered to be the result of inefficient internal&#13;
bureaucratic procedures and a bias towards conventional housing solutions&#13;
within the Department of Housing and Social Services. By establishing the&#13;
HPU as a semi-autonomous agency within the LCC, it became possible to&#13;
bypass some of the usual procedures of the Council's committee system.&#13;
Only by such an arrangement did it become possible to avoid the Local&#13;
Government Service Commission-s controls on the hiring of personnel. With&#13;
all decisions regarding the Lusaka Project centralized in the Finance and&#13;
General Purpose Committee, new personnel possessing specifically needed&#13;
qualifications could be hired, at higher than normal pay scales, if&#13;
necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
The establishment of the HPU was taken to be the first step&#13;
towards creation of an innovative institutional framework to set the&#13;
pattern for an integrated urban development approach in the future. It&#13;
was assumed that by locating the HPU under the umbrella of the LCC, it&#13;
would be easier both to command the support of the Councillors in project&#13;
implementation, and to collect all charges through a single agency.&#13;
To ensure inter-agency coordination and to create a sense&#13;
of collective responsibility in the overall control of the Project, the&#13;
Zambian Government was to create a coordination committee, comprised of&#13;
the following permanent members:&#13;
* Chairman: Minister of State, Ministry of Local Government&#13;
and Housing (MLGH).&#13;
* Deputy Chairman: Mayor of Lusaka.&#13;
* Secretary: HPU Project Director (non-voting member).&#13;
* Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance (or his representative).&#13;
* Assistant Secretary (Housing), MLGH.&#13;
* Commissioner of Town and Country Planning.&#13;
* Managing Director, National Housing Authority.&#13;
* Departmental Officers, Lusaka City Council.&#13;
According to this committee-s terms of reference, it also&#13;
had the authority to invite representation from other related ministries&#13;
such as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health. 1/&#13;

Evaluation Findings&#13;
In deciding to establish the HPU as a semi-autonomous unit&#13;
within the LCC it was realized that there would be a trade-off between&#13;
efficiency in project implementation and integration into the normal&#13;
operating systems of the Council. An analysis of the past-performance&#13;
of the LCC in house construction, and the difficulties they would have&#13;
in managing a complex integrated project through the Council's committee&#13;
system, argued for the establishment of a new unit.&#13;
At the same time there was a concern that the sepdration&#13;
between the HPU which was only responsible for the capital project, and&#13;
the LCC which would be responsible for maintenance, would cause future&#13;
problems when the time came to integrate the-project into the normal&#13;
structure of the LCC. There was also a concern that the project was&#13;
setting a bad precedent by setting up a unit with special privileges&#13;
and flexibility and that this approach was implicitly weakening existing&#13;
programs. Some observers felt the project was avoiding the issue of&#13;
institutional development, and that it might have been better to have a&#13;
less complicated project which could have been executed within the&#13;
capabilities of the existing agencies.&#13;
In terms of the efficient implementation of the project the&#13;
decision to establish the HPU as a separate unit seems to have worked&#13;
well. Whilst the LCC had only been able to construct 6090 houses and&#13;
developed 5856 serviced plots over the 10 year period from 1964 to 1974,&#13;
the HPU has successfully upgraded almost 20,000 plots in existing areas and&#13;
developed more than 10,000 serviced plots over a 5 year period. It is&#13;
widely accepted among senior officials of the LCC, the Ministry and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
National Housing Authority that creation of an agency in the nature of the&#13;
HPU was the best possible administrative procedure for the implementation&#13;
of such a large scale project. 2/ The HPU was able to attract high level&#13;
staff and to develop innovative new management systems.&#13;
Two often cited drawbacks of the decision to establish HPU&#13;
as a separate unit, are the problems with cost recovery and the potential&#13;
difficulties of integrating the project into the LCC when the HPU is&#13;
disbanded. The cost recovery problem, which will be reviewed in more&#13;
detail in Chapter Nine, has many causes. One contributing factor was&#13;
the problem of deciding how the collections should be made. Initially&#13;
the collections were the responsibility of the LCC, but when problems&#13;
arose, due in part to lack of staff, a greater share of responsibility was&#13;
passed over to the HPU. It will be argued that the poor cost recovery&#13;
performance was due more to a general unwillingness to apply sanctions,&#13;
and to administrative inefficiencies, that it was to the problems of&#13;
coordination between LCC and HPU. There is not real evidence that&#13;
cost recovery would have been improved by HPU being more closely&#13;
integrated into the LCC.&#13;
It is more difficult to judge how successfully the HPU will&#13;
be integrated into the LUDC (Lusaka Urban District Council - formerly the&#13;
LCC) as the process is still underway. The creation of a special "Peri-&#13;
Urban" section within the Department of Housing and Social Services of&#13;
the LUDC inidicates that there will be some form of administrative&#13;

continuity after the formal dissolution of the HPU. It would be premature&#13;
at this point to predict how many of the innovative aspects of the HPU&#13;
the peri-urban sector will retain, or how much the creation of this new&#13;
section will ultimately influence the future pattern of urban management.&#13;
However, according to the Town Clerk, the Management Team and Field Team&#13;
concepts essential to Project Implementation will be retained in all of&#13;
the LUDC's future operations. As the majority of the peri-urban section&#13;
staff have been transferred from HPU, they are expected to continue the&#13;
innovative spirit and lessons learned from the implementation experience.&#13;
Administrative Interaction&#13;
In spite of the clear definition of the HPU as a special&#13;
division within the LCC, officials of the two organizations repeatedly&#13;
interacted as if they belonged to totally different administrative&#13;
entities. An LHPET study showed that most LCC staff associated the HPU&#13;
more closely with the World Bank than with the Council. 3/ An inter-&#13;
departmental consultative committee was created to rectify this situation,&#13;
and to ease the transition in responsibility for project areas from the&#13;
HPU to the LCC. Minutes of the committee-s meetings indicate that the&#13;
transition has not been smooth for a number of reasons. According to its&#13;
terms of reference, the HPU understood itself to be responsible solely&#13;
3/ LHPET, "The Council's Ability to Maintain the Project,"&#13;
Working Paper No. 33, September, 1979, p.4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
for implementation of a capital project. Hence, when certain early-&#13;
completed project components needed maintenance, the HPU considered such&#13;
problems to lie outside the scope of its activities. Meanwhile, the LCC&#13;
was reluctant to step in and deal with such matters until the HPU-s work&#13;
was done and responsibility for project maintenance had been formally&#13;
transferred. Since the nature of the Project made simultaneous completion&#13;
of all its components impossible, this tension between the two organizations&#13;
was never really resolved.&#13;
The lack of definition of responsibility for cost recovery&#13;
and maintenance proved to be one of the major problems in the original-&#13;
project design. Although it would have been difficult to have foreseen the&#13;
problem at the time of Appraisal, this should be kept in mind in planning&#13;
future projects.&#13;
Due to a shortage of maintenance staff and equipment, the&#13;
LCC was hesitant to accept responsibility for maintaining a new project&#13;
area without assurance that the transfer of responsibility would also&#13;
mean the transfer of maintenance equipment. Meanwhile, the HPU was not in&#13;
a position to transfer maintenance equipment for use in completed sites&#13;
since all available equipment was needed to service the whole network of&#13;
project areas. Minutes of the "Hand-over Seminars" indicate that this&#13;
mis-match significantly complicated the transition process. 4/ In&#13;
retrospect, it seems that these administrative difficulties could only&#13;
have been rectified at the design stage, at which point they could not&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
apparently have been foreseen, since the administrative structure&#13;
of this Project was one of its innovative aspects.&#13;
3.   Inter-agency coordination&#13;
The creation of the inter-agency coordination committee&#13;
seems to have had minimal impact on the implementation process. The major&#13;
early task requiring inter-agency cooperation was land acquisition. But&#13;
as it was not expected to be a major issue, the Commissioner of Lands was&#13;
not included in the original membership of the Coordination Committee.&#13;
Though the Commissioner was included later, most of the land acquisition&#13;
issues were dealt with directly by his office, either in correspondence&#13;
or through meetings with HPU officials. Senior HPU officials followed the&#13;
same pattern of communication with other agencies as well. In retrospect,&#13;
it seems unlikely that the HPU could have achieved better results by&#13;
working through a Coordination Committee channel. However, it is probably&#13;
true that if it had encouraged functioning of the Coordination Committee&#13;
at the implementation stage, the HPU could have developed "a valuable&#13;
means of communication for the purpose of securing and retaining under-&#13;
standing and support for the project within tha wider environment of the&#13;
government machinery." 5/&#13;
4.   Organizational Links Between Communities and the HPU&#13;
According to the proposal prepared by the National Housing&#13;
Authority, the Lusaka Project was to be a housing program in which the&#13;
executing agencies would "support and reinforce the residents' own&#13;
5/   D. Pasteur, "The Management of Squatter Upgrading...," Ibid, p.43.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
efforts to improve their environment, rather than take over from them." 6/&#13;
Several policy principles were defined for the relation of housing agencies&#13;
and project communities. First, it was understood that institutional&#13;
involvement in community life must not threaten but respect existing&#13;
rules and systems of conduct. It was stressed throughout that residents&#13;
must have an executive role and be given responsibility for decisions. 7/&#13;
Ward Development Committees&#13;
To help maintain the spirit of participation articulated&#13;
at the outset, the appraisal report suggested the use of local Ward&#13;
Development Committees, to be composed of community representatives and&#13;
chaired by the local City Councillor. These Committees would take part in&#13;
overspill plot allocation and in the mobilizing of self-help labour for&#13;
the construction of certain community facilities.  They would also be&#13;
responsible for shaping long range development programs promoting continuing&#13;
improvement to dwellings, infrastructure, and community services.&#13;
Loan repayment and service charges&#13;
At the appraisal stage it was accepted that the United National&#13;
Independence Party(UNIP), the sole legitimate political party in Zambia,&#13;
should be involved in the collection of loan repayments and monthly&#13;
service charges. The UNIP was seen to have been remarkably effective in&#13;
the informal administration of squatter areas, its role extending far&#13;
beyond the normal responsibilities of political parties. Newcomers were&#13;

required to register with the local UNIP office and had to receive&#13;
its approval before starting to build. The appraisal report proposed&#13;
that each UNIP section leader would be responsible for the payment&#13;
record of about 25 households, though all payments were supposed to be&#13;
made directly by project participants to the City Treasury representative.&#13;
Field Teams&#13;
Contact between the HPU and Project communities was to be&#13;
facilitated by the creation of Field Teams responsible for the coordination&#13;
and conduct of the HPU's field operations. Field Teams were to include&#13;
the surveyors, architects, engineers, Community Development Staff and&#13;
community development workers. Even cashiers and store-keepers of the&#13;
building material stores were to work under the Field Team rubric. The&#13;
Field Team leader was to be responsible for identifying aspects of the&#13;
HPU's operations that required decisions, support, or intervention&#13;
from the head office.&#13;
Evaluation Findings&#13;
According to a study conducted by the Field Director of&#13;
the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) at LHPET-s request,&#13;
the near absence of resistance to the processes of relocation&#13;
and infrastructure installation in the past five years is strong&#13;
evidence that institutional intervention in the community has&#13;
not been perceived as threatening.  8/   The Lack of resistance&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
does not mean that Lusaka's squatter areas are less politicized than&#13;
those in other parts of the developing world. Prior to the Lusaka Project,&#13;
there had often been significant levels of violence and political demon-&#13;
stration in both squatter and sites and services areas. Each community&#13;
further incorporates its own internal power struggles in which any&#13;
intervention pleasing to one may readily alienate another. Given such a&#13;
potentially inflammatory situation, the Lusaka Project-s record of community&#13;
involvement is truly outstanding. A more detailed account of Project&#13;
interaction with the community is provided in Chapter Seven of this&#13;
report. The present section simply sketches the main considerations of&#13;
Project performance.&#13;
Ward Development Committees&#13;
The impact of the Ward Development Committees on the process&#13;
of implementation has been minimal. As various LHPET reports point&#13;
out, the Ward Development Committee was found to be more an ideal&#13;
than a real community structure, while the UNIP does indeed seem to hold&#13;
the real power in the community.  9/   While the UNIP has been one of the&#13;
dominant forces in the settlements since even prior to Independence, and&#13;
has been exercising tight security and social control over these areas,&#13;
the Ward Development Committee, introduced in Lusaka only in 1972, has&#13;
been only loosely involved in articulating popular demands at the levels&#13;
of local and central government.&#13;
Ledogar's report avers that the HPU's decision to work directly with&#13;
the Party leadership rather than through the Ward Development Committee&#13;
9/ LHPET Working Paper No. 10, p. 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
favored the existing power structure. But for a project with such a&#13;
highly specified timetable there was little choice for management&#13;
but to work with the structure that held the effective power in the&#13;
communities. The Ward Development Committee had an inherent weakness of&#13;
influence because nowhere in Lusaka does the ward structure correspond to&#13;
the boundaries of squatter areas, and very few Councillors, unlike the&#13;
local Party leadership, live in the squatter areas. If the Lusaka&#13;
Project had begun with an effort to create a new community structure,&#13;
it would undoubtedly have suffered many further delays, and might&#13;
even have failed in its most basic aims.&#13;
Various officials have pointed out that an important drawback&#13;
of the HPU-s decision to work directly with Party leadership was that the&#13;
Unit thus moved further from the City Council staff's customary modes of&#13;
operation. In distancing itself from the authority of the Councillors in&#13;
this way, the HPU may have lost the possible leverage of that authority&#13;
in the collection of monthly payments. (Not all Councillors have been in&#13;
agreement with the policy of enforcing payments: some have actively&#13;
campaigned against enforcement, perhaps finding a political advantage in&#13;
doing so.) In the project maintenance stage the need for an effective&#13;
organizational structure, as envisioned in the Ward Development Committee&#13;
system, may not be met by the informal representative structure of the&#13;
Party.&#13;
5. Internal Structure of the HPU&#13;
Considerations at the design stage&#13;
Flexibility of operation and responsiveness to problems in&#13;
the field were viewed as key factors in the design of the Housing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
Project Unit-s internal structure. The unique scale and complexity of the&#13;
Lusaka Project called for an organizational structure that would promote&#13;
learning from experience. According to the former Deputy Director of the&#13;
HPU, the situation required a new management approach in which staff are&#13;
divided not according to their disciplines, but according to their tasks.&#13;
The so-called "Head Office" staff would be responsible for&#13;
formulating policy guidelines to be followed by the Field Teams. They in&#13;
turn would report to the Management Team frequently on the impact of&#13;
policy. The primary responsibility of the Field Teams was to see that the&#13;
objectives of the Project were met.&#13;
The internal structure of the HPU was to include a Project&#13;
Director, Deputy Project Director, and three Division Heads designated&#13;
Chief of Engineering, Chief of Social Services, and Chief of Finance and&#13;
Procurement. These officers were to meet fortnightly. The Field Teams,&#13;
comprised of staff from all three divisions, were also to meet frequently.&#13;
At the time of Project appraisal it was proposed that a&#13;
Special Communications Section also be set up, partly in response&#13;
to encouragement from UNICEF. This special section was proposed to&#13;
facilitate communications within the HPU and between the HPU and Project&#13;
communities.&#13;
Evaluation Findings&#13;
Though the concept of Field Team and Management Team had&#13;
been accepted by the LCC as early as 1968, the Lusaka Project was the&#13;
first to employ the concept effectively. The HPU Management Team was&#13;
comprised of professionals with considerable field experience who were&#13;
more responsive to exigencies of the field than traditional bureaucrats.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-87 -&#13;
The practice of having frequent management meetings that brought Field&#13;
Team leaders into dialogue with senior management officials further&#13;
facilitated the process of mutual understanding. It is important to note,&#13;
however, that the Field Team/Management Team structure does not guarantee&#13;
a successful implementation process without a sufficiently large field&#13;
staff. The Lusaka Project experience suggests that a ratio of one field&#13;
staff member to 100 project families may be an ideal standard for future&#13;
projects. 10/&#13;
As weekly management meetings proceeded, they also gradually&#13;
expanded to include various other field and head office staff besides the&#13;
Section Chiefs, the Project Director, and his Deputy. The minutes of&#13;
these meetings indicate that they significantly enhanced the sense of&#13;
accountability on the part of all involved. By giving balanced consideration&#13;
to input from the viewpoints of various disciplines in each session, the&#13;
meetings reinforced and gave continuity to the Project s innovative,&#13;
multi-disciplinary approach. The only possible disadvantage of the&#13;
frequent management meetings is that they may have encouraged the&#13;
disinclination of Management Staff to go into the field and make direct&#13;
observations. Even if this did happen, it is not an inevitable weakness&#13;
of the system, and could be easily corrected.&#13;
The Communication Section&#13;
The HPU's Communications Section proved to have a vital part in the&#13;
implementation process. Its intra-departmental monthly newsletter facilitated&#13;
10/ Personal interview with Robert Ledogar of the American Friends&#13;
Service Committee, October, 1978. The AFSC was responsible for&#13;
providing Community Development Staff in the Jack extension&#13;
area which has the best payment record so far.&#13;

communication within the HPU and helped to sustain a sense of the Project's&#13;
urgency. The Communications Section was especially resourceful in&#13;
promoting favorable relations between the HPU and project communities.&#13;
The Section's staging of a series of urban dramas depicting the benefits&#13;
of Project activity was very effective in drawing the attention of&#13;
low-income families. Its organization of a local band specializing in&#13;
urban music with Project-related themes was another very positive means&#13;
of conveying the HPU's message to the community. The Communications&#13;
Section has also been responsible for producing radio and television&#13;
programs in the various local languages, and for performing well in&#13;
guiding the various visiting foreign delegations that have witnessed&#13;
Project achievements.&#13;

PART III: EFFICIENCY OF PROJECT OPERATIONS&#13;
CHAPTER FOUR: ACHIEVEMENT OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT&#13;
Table 4.1 presents the progress, as of June 1981, in the&#13;
achievement of the main objectives of the project as stated in the&#13;
Appraisal Report.&#13;
Most of the provision of infrastructure has been completed in&#13;
the upgrading areas. Although there was a delay of almost three years,&#13;
19,916 families have received communal water, roads, and garbage collection&#13;
(almost 3000 more than originally planned). All of the overspill and 85&#13;
percent of the sites and services plots have been developed, but with a&#13;
delay of almost five years (they should have been completed in 1976).&#13;
Over half of the core units have been erected in the overspill areas and&#13;
over 40 percent in the sites and services areas. (In fact, the progress&#13;
is greater than it appears, as a unit is not defined as having been&#13;
erected until all of the paper work is done after completion of the&#13;
construction). The delays in the completion of the construction is&#13;
reflected also in the fact that only about 80 percent of the target&#13;
volume of building material loans have been authorized.&#13;
The area where the project has suffered most is with respect&#13;
to the installation of community facilities. Only 8 out of 20 schools&#13;
have been constructed, 6 out of 17 markets and 7 out of the 17 community&#13;
centers.&#13;

housing estate.  16 normal low cost sites were used for construction of a site office and building material&#13;
store.  There was a net loss of 435 normal medium cost plots because of the presence of a high water table on&#13;
site 6 (-530) and utilization of a portion of the site for a school and church (-5).  Site 7 was substituted&#13;

The reason for the failurd to provide some of the community&#13;
facilities is that the implementation of many aspects of the project were&#13;
delayed two to four years. During this period Zambia was suffering from&#13;
a high rate of inflation. It was estimated that construction costs&#13;
increased by an average of 130 percent between 1975 and 1981. 1/ For&#13;
example, cement increased by 272 percent, door frames by 100 percent and&#13;
diesel by 200 percent. Table 4.2 shows that there were cost overruns of&#13;
16 percent for primary infrastructure, and 68 percent for site preparation&#13;
in upgrading areas. At the same time, there was an overrun of only 1&#13;
percent in total project cost. The only way to compensate for these&#13;
overruns was to cut out many of the community facilities.&#13;
Inflation also raised the cost of house construction and hence&#13;
the required size of loans in overspill areas. Partly as a consequence&#13;
of this (as well of the unexpectedly high demand for loans as families&#13;
opted to buy\ ready made materials rather than make their own bricks) the&#13;
number of loans which could be given in upgrading areas was reduced.&#13;
The results demonstrate that the project design was valid, that&#13;
progressive development does work, and that the houses produced are&#13;
substantially cheaper than any available alternatives. However, for a&#13;
future project to completely achieve its goals it would be necessary to&#13;
eliminate many of the administrative bottlenecks encounted in the first&#13;
project. This should not be too difficult as the experience in Lusaka&#13;
has clearly identified most of these problems and in many cases suggested&#13;
how they could be solved in future projects.&#13;

CHAPTER FIVE: LAND ACQUISITION&#13;
The most serious cause of delays in project implementation&#13;
proved to be the process of land acquisition. One of the requirements&#13;
for loan effectiveness was the passage of the Housing (Statutory and&#13;
Improvement Areas) Act of 1974. This Act allows for leases of up to&#13;
99 years in sites and services areas and occupancy licenses for up&#13;
to 30 years in upgrading areas. It was assumed that this Act, together&#13;
with the Land Acquisition Act of 1969, which permitted the compulsory&#13;
acquisition of land, would facilitate the acquisition of land required&#13;
for the projects. Consequently, the process of land acquisition was&#13;
programmed for completion within one year. In fact in several cases the&#13;
process took up to three years and caused serious delays in project&#13;
implementation. The following is a summary of the main causes of these&#13;
delays: 1/&#13;
a.   The land in the Project areas was divided into a very large&#13;
number of small holdings. There were a total of 48&#13;
separate holdings to be acquired in George and 15 in&#13;
Chaisa. The process of acquisition had to be conducted&#13;
separately for each holding.&#13;
b.   The HPU had assumed the process of acquisition would&#13;
be relatively straightforward so a year went by before&#13;
they began to become concerned and to exert pressure.&#13;
c.   The process of acquisition was quite complex and involved&#13;
a number of different ministries.&#13;
1/   Most of the information for this chapter is taken from&#13;
Pasteur (op. cit.), .Chapter 5. Reference is also made to&#13;
Schlyter for George, Muller for Chawama and to Martin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
d.   The Lands Department was understaffed and seems to&#13;
have given a low priority to the HPU project. The&#13;
Commissioner was responsible for all land transfers in&#13;
Zambia so was under considerable pressure at the time.&#13;
e.   Each piece of land had to be separately surveyed and&#13;
the value estimated. At the time there was only one&#13;
registered Chartered Surveyor in Lusaka.&#13;
f.   As a result of the Lands Acquisition Act of 1970 and&#13;
the Land (Conversion of Titles) Act of 1975 owners&#13;
received very little compensation for their land and&#13;
hence had no incentive to sell. In many cases the&#13;
owners hired laywers to oppose the acquisition or&#13;
to try and delay it. The new laws also meant that the&#13;
HPU was not able to offer a higher price to give the&#13;
owners an incentive to sell.&#13;
g.   In some cases a large number of owners became actively&#13;
opposed to the takeover and fought it in an organized&#13;
way. The most difficult case for the HPU was the&#13;
acquisition of the land for Site 7 of the sites and&#13;
services project. The land was partially occupied by&#13;
about 100 farmers from the Mudziwathu Farming Cooperative.&#13;
It was hoped the transfer would have been completed&#13;
by 1976, but one year later the process had still not&#13;
been completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
h.   Another complicating factor was that the process of community&#13;
participation in the planning and project development meant&#13;
that the decisions on which land would be acquired could not&#13;
all be made at one time. Pasteur states that in September 1976&#13;
the Commissioner of Lands asked the HPU to provide a complete&#13;
list of land to be acquired. The reply by the HPU was as&#13;
follows:&#13;
"It has to be emphasized that the upgrading&#13;
program is geared to the needs of the residents&#13;
and all plans and layouts prepared are done in&#13;
consultation with them.   To that extent the&#13;
whole approach to upgrading is flexible, in&#13;
order to ensure the involvement of the people,&#13;
their cooperation and the final success of&#13;
this pioneering project. As such, the needs also&#13;
tend to vary to suit changing circumstances." 2/&#13;
Although the process of acquiring the land for project develop-&#13;
ment could take up to three years, the process of giving title to the&#13;
individual families has taken even longer. Under the Housing (Statutory&#13;
and Improvement Areas) Act of 1974 families could be issued with 30&#13;
year Occupancy Titles. In addition to giving the family a greater sense&#13;
of security the issuance of these titles was considered to be an important&#13;
part of the cost recovery system. Once a family had a title, the threat&#13;
of its withdrawal was expected to be an effective sanction to encourage&#13;
families to keep up to date with their payments. Unfortunately, four&#13;
years after the legislation had been passed it was still not possible&#13;
to issue the titles as all of the administrative procedures had not&#13;
been completed. By the time the titles began to be issued in 1979&#13;
2/ Pasteur ( op. cit.), page 84.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
and 1980 many families had been living in the improved house for several&#13;
years and hence felt that no great benefit would be obtained from the&#13;
occupancy title.&#13;
The question has also arisen as to whether the Occupancy Title&#13;
is the appropriate form of tenure to offer. The title is less secure&#13;
than a normal leasehold title and it appears that Banks will not accept&#13;
it as security for a loan. It has been suggested that it might have been&#13;
better to offer normal leasehold titles rather than to create this new,&#13;
and less attractive, title.&#13;

CHAPTER SIX: THE SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS FOR&#13;
SITES AND SERVICES PROJECTS&#13;
Selection Criteria&#13;
In the sites and services component of the Lusaka Project,&#13;
3,200 normal plots and 1,200 basic plots were offered to interested&#13;
applicants on six sites chosen in accordance with the Lusaka Master Plan.&#13;
In order to accomodate low-income applicants, at the time of project&#13;
appraisal 50% of all plots were initially set aside for individuals with&#13;
incomes between 20 and 70 Kwacha per month. These standards were open to&#13;
revision, subject to World Bank approval. Organization of the selection&#13;
process was done with the aims of minimizing allocation and other admini-&#13;
strative delays, ensuring a high rate of plot take-up and house consolid-&#13;
ation, and establishing an efficient collection system that would&#13;
minimize default.l/&#13;
To be eligible for a plot, an applicant had to be a resident&#13;
of Lusaka, have the intention to live in the purchased house, and be&#13;
self- or wage-employed with a monthly income of at least 20 Kwacha (in&#13;
1974). Refundable deposits of 5 Kwacha per basic plot, and 10 Kwacha per&#13;
normal plot were required on return of applications. 2/&#13;
Applicant Responses&#13;
After some delays, the response was tremendous: approximately&#13;
12,000 applications were received from Site 1 (Matero) and Site 5 (Lilanda).&#13;
1/ LHPET, "Application, Allocation, and Briefing Procedures for the&#13;
Serviced Plot Programme," Working Paper No.11, September, 1977, p. 2.&#13;
2/ Deposits were not required for the first projects but as over&#13;
12,000 applications were received it was decided to introduce&#13;
a deposit as a way to determine how many of the applicants were&#13;
really serious (Communication from Richard Martin).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
Although applicants were initially judged on a first come, first served&#13;
basis, the screening committee developed a point system to rank applicants&#13;
according to family size, security of present tenure, and present standards&#13;
of services in the home. 3/ In this system, a household in which there&#13;
was less than one person per room would receive a minimum of points on&#13;
this criterion, while a maximum point rating would be given to a household&#13;
with five or more persons per room. Preference was also given by the&#13;
point system to those with low present dwelling standards, and to those&#13;
who shared facilities over those who had their own.&#13;
Following final computer ranking according to income, total&#13;
number of points, and applicant-s choice of site, data were verified and&#13;
the list of qualified applicants was sent to the LCC Plot Allocation&#13;
Committee--the Mayor, Town Clerk, and Project Director--for approval.&#13;
The process seemed simple in theory, but in fact closing&#13;
dates had to be extended repeatedly because of a lack of applications&#13;
from families earning 70 Kwacha or less. This was due to the fact that&#13;
in 1973 when the income limits were defined, a family with a monthly&#13;
income of 70 Kwacha could afford the project. However, due to the 10%&#13;
annual inflation an income of 70 Kwacha in 1976 had become too low to&#13;
afford the project. This circumstance necessitated raising the upper&#13;
income level for "low-income" applicants first to 85 Kwacha, and later to&#13;
120 Kwacha. Another factor forcing the need to redefine income criteria&#13;
was the rapid increase in building costs. Between December, 1974 and&#13;
December 1976, the building material index rose from 100% to 135%.&#13;
3/   One of the main reasons for doing this was to develop a method of&#13;
screening the huge number of applicants. Families were not ranked&#13;
by income and selection was done separately for the "low" and "high"&#13;
income groups. (Communication from Richard Martin.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
Evaluation Findings&#13;
In evaluating the selection process it is important to take&#13;
into account the difficult circumstances under which selection had to be&#13;
done. Due to problems of land acquisition (see Chapter 5) and other&#13;
delays, the selection took place at a later date than previously planned,&#13;
and as a consequence the previously defined income criteria were no longer&#13;
appropriate. At the same time there was a larger than expected demand so&#13;
that new screening procedures had to be developed as the projects progressed.&#13;
The magnitude of this task can be appreciated when it is recalled that&#13;
there were over 12,000 applicants for the first projects, all of which&#13;
had to be reviewed individually.&#13;
The names of approved applicants (820 from Site 1, and 623 from&#13;
Site 5) were published some 22 months after the Project was initiated.&#13;
Applicants were asked to make their deposits within 7 weeks (later&#13;
extended to 10 weeks) after their acceptance into the Project. 4/&#13;
The available evidence indicates that the selection process&#13;
was as impartial as possible in the application of its criteria, and that&#13;
every effort was made to fill the quota with low-income families. Despite&#13;
cost increases, applicants were selected preponderantly from the poorest&#13;
half of Lusaka-s population. 5/ In Lilanda, a basic sites and services&#13;
project, about 58% of families come from the poorest 30 percent of&#13;
families in the city. Even in Matero, a more expensive sites and services&#13;
project, 36% of families are in the lowest 30% of the urban income&#13;
distribution. Furthermore, 65% of selected families were tenants, and&#13;
30% lived in shared accommodations. The majority of approved applicants,&#13;
62%, had been living in squatter areas.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
Avoidable Errors&#13;
Despite the fairness and organizational adequacy of the selection&#13;
process, bureaucratic missteps, so common in past housing programs,&#13;
caused unnecessary delays and even some intial dropouts. Although some&#13;
delays are inevitable in the processing of large numbers of applications,&#13;
certain errors can be pinpointed and hopefully thus be avoided in future&#13;
practice.&#13;
Because of insufficient briefing, some community officers&#13;
provided applicants with contradictory, sometimes erroneous information.&#13;
Language used in the application forms themselves was the cause of&#13;
misunderstanding among applicants. It was not clear, for example,&#13;
whether "accomodation" referred to an individual's personal living space&#13;
or to the structure housing it. Apparently the word "family" needed a&#13;
more precise definition as well, since questions about family size&#13;
elicited much misinformation. In addition the forms were originally only&#13;
printed in English, a language with which many participants have difficulties.&#13;
Because applicants' information was not checked at the time&#13;
they submitted applications, verification became necessary, as it was&#13;
discovered that, for various reasons, most applications contained erroneous&#13;
information. Further delays occurred as verification personnel found it&#13;
difficult to carry out their tasks in widely scattered areas lacking in&#13;
transportation facilities. Other delays followed from the fact that proof&#13;
of income eligibility was considered so late in the process, postponing&#13;
certain problems to the point where applicants were to fill out Loan&#13;
Agreement forms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
Modifications&#13;
Some of the problems experienced in the intial selection&#13;
of beneficiaries were corrected by the time Sites 6 and 7 were introduced&#13;
in 1977 and 1978. After June 1977, the verification procedure was&#13;
simplified and the system was changed to permit income verification on an&#13;
individual basis with each applicant. The initial deposit requirement was&#13;
dropped to make Project housing accessible to low-income families who&#13;
could afford a house but not a downpayment also. And application forms&#13;
have been simplified and printed in at least one local language besides&#13;
English.&#13;
Chapter Nine of this report presents more detailed information&#13;
eatablishing that the selection process achieved the objective of&#13;
making housing opportunties available to the city's low-income population.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

CHAPTER SEVEN: COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
The objectives of the Lusaka Project and the Zambian Government's&#13;
national philosophy of Humanism coincided in making a priority of&#13;
popular participation in decisions and activities affecting the life of&#13;
the community. The kind of informal cooperation that can make self-help&#13;
and mutual-help construction activity possible has always existed among&#13;
residents of the squatter areas. The Project viewed this indigenous&#13;
tradition as an available resource, as it viewed the squatter settlements&#13;
themselves as viable starting points. This approach proved to be a major&#13;
contributing factor to the Project's success. Only in sites and services&#13;
areas did the conditions of community have to be established. In Project&#13;
areas, 50 households form a Party Section. Sections make up a branch.&#13;
Each complex has several branches, and it is within these branches&#13;
that a distinct sense of local community tends to develop.&#13;
The Housing Project Unit wanted to encourage communities&#13;
use of individual and collective self-help labor in water-main excavation,&#13;
the development of community facilities, and house construction and&#13;
improvement. Ward Development Committees, comprised of community represent-&#13;
atives and chaired by the local City Councillor would participate in plot&#13;
allocation, help mobilize collective self-help labor for community&#13;
facility construction, and shape long-range development programs to&#13;
promote continued improvement of dwellings, infrastructure, and community&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
The World Bank negotiating team supported the idea of collective&#13;
self-help but secured Government agreement that contractors would be&#13;
hired, in consultation with the Bank, should the self-help approach&#13;
interfere unduly with timely execution of the Project.&#13;
To make the encouragement of collective self-help as productive&#13;
as possible, community leaders took an active part in the processes&#13;
of briefing, plot allocation, and organizing of self-help projects,&#13;
as well as participating in decisions about road layout and in collection&#13;
of service charges.&#13;
The decisions affecting people who live in squatter compounds&#13;
are made at many levels by various institutions. Where political&#13;
matters are concerned, decisions are made by the Party at the section,&#13;
branch, regional, or national level, or by a parallel organization at the&#13;
District Governor's Office, or the Provincial Political Secretary's&#13;
Development Committee.&#13;
The coming of the upgrading process ushered in a new concept&#13;
of development that could not adequately be implemented either by the&#13;
Party or by the Ward Development Committee. Party representatives played&#13;
an important role in the process of briefing beneficiaries on the nature&#13;
of the upgrading process, and exhorting them to cooperate and take part&#13;
in it. But to some extent, the success of the implementation depended&#13;
upon the emergence of the Road Planning Groups as decision-making structures&#13;
closely representative of community interests.&#13;
Evaluation Findings: Community Involvement&#13;
The success of the Project-s community involvement effort&#13;
is best measured by the remarkable fact that even the most disruptive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104-&#13;
Project works met with virtually no popular resistance. During the four&#13;
years of direct field activity, 8,000 households were resettled, 3.5&#13;
million Kwacha worth of building materials were distributed, large and&#13;
inconvenient infrastructure works were carried out, and the normal power&#13;
relations among Party leaders, landlords, business persons, and City&#13;
Councillors significantly disturbed. Yet active collaboration with&#13;
community leadership kept a potentially volatile situation from becoming&#13;
one of conflict. Much Project staff time was devoted to intensive&#13;
briefings and to the imaginative use of mass communications to acquaint&#13;
residents with the course of Project activities and their potential&#13;
benefits. Section and branch Party officials introduced HPU staff at&#13;
briefing meetings and aided in the dissemination of information on the&#13;
Project's expected effects on the lives of residents. Although the&#13;
briefing meetings initially reached only about 40% of the household heads&#13;
affected by the Project, the majority of these people felt that the&#13;
briefings served their purpose well.&#13;
Community leadership seminars provided an opportunity for&#13;
the local leaders to present their grievances and questions which were&#13;
then raised and responded to during the weekly Management Meetings.&#13;
Road Planning Groups&#13;
The Road Planning Groups, born of the dialogue between Project&#13;
Management and community leaders in John Howard, the first upgraded&#13;
settlement, represent the most direct form of community participation in&#13;
decision making. The Road Planning groups include representatives of all&#13;
community interest groups and have substantial influence in decisions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
relating to the routing of roads and which houses must be demolished.&#13;
The role of the HPU is that of consultant. In fact the decision making&#13;
power of the Groups is often constrained by technical factors.&#13;
An important factor here is that the more recently formed Road&#13;
Planning Groups in Garden and Chaisa have not disbanded after deciding&#13;
upon road routes and community center locations. They continue to meet&#13;
weekly or fortnightly to plan other activities, air complaints to field&#13;
staff, and keep track of the upgrading process. The efforts of Community&#13;
Development Staff continue to be directed toward the aim of seeing that&#13;
the Road Planning Groups' activities reflect the actual interests of&#13;
project residents and that they accord with the ideal of participatory&#13;
democracy.&#13;
Self-Help in the Community&#13;
One of the objectives of the Project's community development&#13;
component was to encourage residents to look to their own resources,&#13;
after the HPU had ceased operating, before turning to city or national&#13;
government. Thus the HPU intended to rely as much as possible on self-&#13;
help in the implementation process. It was intended to use both collective&#13;
self-help in which families would work together in groups, and individual&#13;
self-help in which each family would work on its own. Originally, the&#13;
Project design anticipated that a considerable amount of construction&#13;
would be carried out through collective self-help.&#13;
The first category of collective self-help proposed by the&#13;
HPU was the payment of residents for work that would normally be done by&#13;
a contractor. Money thus earned would be credited to the community and&#13;
used for building needed facilities the HPU would be unable to provide.&#13;

The second category is the corporate provision of facilities&#13;
the Project does not include. By pooling resources, groups of residents&#13;
could purchase a facility needed in their area. Many expressed a desire&#13;
to take this course so as to have individual water connections rather&#13;
than the communal standpipe offered by the Project design.&#13;
The main form of individual self-help was to be house construction.&#13;
This category of activity is dealt with in detail at a later point in this&#13;
chapter (see "House Construction and Consolidation").&#13;
Evaluation Findings: Collective Self-Help&#13;
The amount of work the HPU had hoped to accomplish by means&#13;
of residents' collective self-help was curtailed by strenuous pressure&#13;
from building contractors. The activities least affected by this pressure&#13;
from business was trench digging. Robert Ledogar's evaluation of community&#13;
participation includes the following table showing the payments received&#13;
by 4 communities during trench digging projects. It is important to note&#13;
that the table does not take into account the opportunity cost of time&#13;
of the participants (see later in this section).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

All those involved in these digging projects agree that&#13;
the amount of staff time they demand is considerable. There were also&#13;
suggestions that some local leaders used considerable pressure to ensure&#13;
a high level of participation. In Ledogar's opinion, it is hard to&#13;
justify the promotion of collective self-help activities in terms of&#13;
short-range economic criteria. In the Chawama Nyerere Compound, for&#13;
example, the trench digging operation cost about 30% of its total earnings&#13;
in terms of staff time and transport. However, as a first effort to&#13;
induce community participation in a housing project of this scale, the&#13;
collective self-help activities cannot be reckoned a failure. These&#13;
activities did "support and reinforce the residents' own efforts to&#13;
improve their environment." Ledogar confirms that they also enhanced the&#13;
authority of the community leadership while encouraging the leadership to&#13;
become more democratic, and so, he concludes, it is likely that these&#13;
small work projects did ultimately help to offset the potentially alienating&#13;
effects of a-massive housing intervention. A limited use of collective&#13;
self-help was also made for filling in ditches, building Party offices,&#13;
and emergency drainage works.&#13;
As for the corporate provision of facilities, residents&#13;
in several areas have pooled resources in order to install their own&#13;
individual water connections where they are not included in the Project&#13;
design. A few blocks in Garden have been equipped with the connections,&#13;
but most are still awaiting installation, delayed by a shortage of&#13;
pipe-fittings, or by problems of neigborhood concensus.&#13;
&#13;

The Role of the Community Development Staff in Upgrading&#13;
The National Housing Authority-s original Project proposal&#13;
called for the institution and training of a Community Development&#13;
Staff. Such a Staff was created within the HPU's Social Services Section,&#13;
with assistance from UNICEF and the American Friends Service Committee.&#13;
The function of the Staff would be to facilitate relations between&#13;
Project management and area residents, and to handle many of the direct&#13;
dealings with beneficiaries during the implementation process. CD Staff&#13;
were expected to be well-informed about the social characteristics, local&#13;
leadership, and living conditions of the areas within which they were to&#13;
work.&#13;
Evaluation Findings: Community Development Staff&#13;
Because of cost considerations, the Community Development&#13;
Staff that actually worked on the Project was about half the size of that&#13;
envisioned in the NHA's proposal. Project activities made heavy and&#13;
changing demands on the Staff s administrative and communication skills.&#13;
One of the most important functions perfomed by the CD Staff was in&#13;
smoothing the potentially disruptive relocation process in upgrading&#13;
areas. They also performed important administrative tasks, such as the&#13;
processing of applicants for loan cards, interviewing families before&#13;
relocation, and contacting individuals who failed to develop their plots&#13;
or who were seriously in arrears on loan or service charge payments. CD&#13;
staff also received complaints from the community on behalf of HPU&#13;
management, settling those they were able to handle personally, and&#13;
referring more difficult cases to management. In these ways, the CD staff&#13;
formed a vital link between project residents and the Management Team.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
To a large extent the Community Development Staff lived&#13;
up to the expectation that it would stimulate community participa-&#13;
tion in project works, persuade residents to make payments on time, and&#13;
encourage the construction of solid and good-looking houses. The Staff&#13;
can also be credited with encouraging residents to maintain the new&#13;
infrastructure, to continue the upgrading process, and to take part in&#13;
the development of social services for children, youth, and the unemployed.&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER EIGHT: HOUSE CONSTRUCTION AND CONSOLIDATION&#13;
On the whole, the house construction component of the Lusaka&#13;
Project must be rated a success. Nearly all the planned units are completed&#13;
or in process of construction. Project housing has proved accessible to&#13;
its low-income target population, and it has been produced at a fraction&#13;
of the cost of the cheapest public housing. A typical house in the&#13;
overspill areas can be built in 2 months at a cost of about K600.   This&#13;
compared with a cost of around K6000 for the cheapest contractor built&#13;
public housing. It was possible for beneficiaries to build their houses&#13;
fairly quickly, and most have registered their general satisfaction with&#13;
the results.&#13;
This section will review the aspects of the house construction&#13;
and consolidation process, and evaluate the related areas of materials&#13;
stores and loans, and participants- use of self-help labor.&#13;
Housing Options&#13;
Technical assistance, materials loans, and materials provision&#13;
through project stores were offered to households in each type of project&#13;
location.&#13;
In squatter areas where essential resettlement was to be&#13;
effected, the first step was thorough briefing of local leadership&#13;
and residents. Once families agreed to move to overspill areas, they had&#13;
to begin work on a temporary shelter within a month. Their initial task&#13;
was to construct a pit latrine and a temporary shelter in which to live&#13;
while their permanent house was under construction. Participating&#13;
families were required to move quickly so that their previous house could&#13;
be demolished, rather than being sublet to another household, thus&#13;
defeating the purpose of making land available for essential infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

resettlement to the overspill areas. (Photo: Courtesy Housing Project Unit)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
Houses in these areas were normally built according to one of the four&#13;
plans offered by the HPU, but a family might also obtain authorization to&#13;
build according to its own design. In addition to procuring materials&#13;
from the project store, many participants also brought usable materials&#13;
from their previous dwelling.&#13;
In addition to families who were forced to move due to essential&#13;
resettlement, other families were permitted to move in order to dedensify.&#13;
In these cases there was normally no time pressure to move, and it&#13;
has been observed that the quality of the houses produced by the voluntary&#13;
movers may have been higher. 1/ However, this point has not been&#13;
systematically tested in the evaluation.&#13;
Self-Help Labor&#13;
The expectation that self-help labor would be a major factor&#13;
in the house construction process was based on two assumptions: that high&#13;
rates of unemployment in target areas would provide a large pool of idle&#13;
labor, and that the opportunity cost of participants' own labor would be&#13;
very low. In fact, both these assumptions need to be modified. Table&#13;
8.1 shows that in the two sites and services projects studied (Lilanda&#13;
and Matero) 85% and 92% of the families used hired labor for at least&#13;
part of the construction.&#13;
There are several reasons why project beneficiaries relied&#13;
so significantly on hired labor in building their houses. First,&#13;
studies show that project participants do not have as much free time as&#13;
had been assumed. This is evidenced by the lower than expected unemployment&#13;
rates (6.8% and 4.2% in Lilanda and Matero respectively).&#13;
1/   This was suggested by Richard Martin in a communication to the&#13;
authors.&#13;

In Lilanda, for example, it was found that household heads&#13;
work on average 45 hours per week, with 46% working at least 6 days a&#13;
week, and 7% working more than 60 hours per week. In such circumstances,&#13;
the little time left for leisure and rest is not likely to be used for&#13;
housing construction.&#13;
The HPU policy of pressuring beneficiaries to build as quickly&#13;
as possible 2/ is another factor explaining the preponderant use of hired&#13;
labor in the construction of the house, and also in the purchase rather&#13;
than production of self-made materials. Given that it takes 100 to 160&#13;
man/hours of hard labor to produce enough soil-cement blocks for a&#13;
two-room core house, it is easy to see how HPU policy demanding rapid&#13;
construction could have discouraged families from building with their own&#13;
materials (especially since many of them would have had to acquire the&#13;
necessary skills in the process.) 3/.&#13;
In the opinion of Richard Martin care should be taken not to&#13;
place too great an emphasis on the time constraint as the main explanation&#13;
for not using own labor:&#13;
"The reason for lack of attempt by householders to&#13;
build their own house was more a lack of confidence&#13;
than a lack of time. The original intention was&#13;
that the construction advisors (who came to be known&#13;
as CDA Construction) would train those who wanted&#13;
to do simple brick-laying tasks: not just men, but&#13;
women as well. However (a) the pace of the resettle-&#13;
ment programme exceeded the capacity of the staff to&#13;
serve the customers, so to speak, and (b) the CDA's&#13;
themselves preferred a bureaucratic role of checking&#13;
standards and quantities of materials used to that of&#13;
training. In other words if we had had the time to&#13;
2/ This was done so that the previous dwelling in the upgrading area&#13;
could be demolished before it was occupied by another family, which&#13;
would have defeated the purpose of the whole essential resettlement&#13;
exercise.&#13;

mount a simple training programme, they could&#13;
have had the time to use the skills. It cannot&#13;
be assumed that paid labor was always efficient:&#13;
much of the time the householders spent chasing&#13;
their "contractor" could also have been used in&#13;
building." 5/&#13;
Under the actual circumstances of project works, preparing&#13;
construction materials and building one's own house required not only the&#13;
time and skills to do the work, but also the entrepreneurial ability to&#13;
find the necessary raw ingredients in sufficient supply and at affordable&#13;
prices. During most of the project work span, there was an acute shortage&#13;
of raw construction materials, especially cement and building sand.&#13;
Acquiring these materials would have presented logistical obstacles even&#13;
to beneficiaries with the time and ability to build with self-made&#13;
materials. It was decidedly easier and more convenient to buy the&#13;
prepared materials and components available through HPU stores.&#13;
Finally, self-help materials and structures had a reputation&#13;
for inferior quality. Contractor-made and commercially available products&#13;
had a claim to professional quality and durability that many beneficiaries&#13;
seem to have seen as compensating for their own lack of building skills.&#13;
The factor of quality is also important in that many families sub-let&#13;
part of the house. It was found, for example, that when commercially&#13;
made blocks were used, a higher rent could be charged than when the house&#13;
was constructed with self-made, sun-dried blocks.&#13;
It is important not to conclude from this discussion that&#13;
the concept of self-help construction is not useful. Several studies&#13;
show that in fact poorer families do make more use of self-help than do&#13;
5/   Communication from Richard Martin to the authors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

richer families. In Table 8.1 it can be seen that in Lilanda, a project&#13;
designed for lower income families, own labor represents a considerably&#13;
higher proportion of total labor than in the richer Matero project (own&#13;
labor accounted for 41% of total labor in Lilanda as compared to 27% in&#13;
Matero). Further evidence of the importance of self-help is given&#13;
below in Table 8.2.&#13;

Number of Inteviews              110                         146&#13;
In both projects it can be seen that poorer families spend a&#13;
lower proportion of total construction costs on hiring labor. In Matero,&#13;
where the relation can be seen more clearly, families with incomes under&#13;
100 Kwacha, on average spent only about 15% of total construction cost on&#13;
hiring labor. For families with incomes over 200 Kwacha the proportion&#13;
rises to about 23%. These figures suggest that self-help is an important&#13;
option which should be included in a project and which can be very&#13;
important for poorer families whose limited resources would constrain&#13;
their ability to pay for hired labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
Technical assistance&#13;
Some of the problems cited above were supposed to be eliminated&#13;
through the provision of technical assistance. In George, however,&#13;
only 30% of the households approved of the technical assistance offered,&#13;
and their approval was based on the fact that a Technical Assistant's&#13;
visits made contractors build to a higher standard than they would have&#13;
otherwise. Very few families considered they had received training in&#13;
construction techniques. In Matero, 95% of the households approved of&#13;
the technical assistance they received, but again cited supervision of&#13;
hired labor as its primary benefit to them. 85% of the households respond-&#13;
ing in Matero thought that technical assistance from the HPU had made&#13;
bricklayers work to a higher standard, while only 6.3% indicated its&#13;
value in helping them build for themselves.&#13;
Materials loans&#13;
Administration of building materials loans to project participants&#13;
was another responsibility of the HPU. Participants were issued loan&#13;
cardis and were able to obtain the value in materials indicated on the&#13;
cards without having to pay cash, provided they got materials from an HPU&#13;
project store. All participants were eligible for a basic loan, the size&#13;
of the loan depending on the estimated cost of upgrading or of building&#13;
a two-room expandable core house. These loans carried an interest&#13;
rate of 7.5% over a fifteen year period in order to defray the purchase&#13;
cost of materials and operating costs of the material depots. Repayment&#13;
of loans was to start six months after the date of the loan (at which&#13;
time the loan would be closed). Table 8.3 shows the repayment schedule&#13;
for materials loans.&#13;

As construction costs increased dramatically, it became&#13;
clear that the original loan amounts had become inadequate to their&#13;
purpose, and they were consequently increased to accord with higher&#13;
building expenses.&#13;
Evaluation studies have shown that the Building Materials&#13;
Loan Program was crucial to the success of the Project. A large number of&#13;
families do not appear to have had access to other sources of financing&#13;
(contrary to design assumptions and to experience in other countries),&#13;
and once loans were exhausted, the rate of house construction slowed&#13;
drastically. The Program had the effect of making some families aware&#13;
that there were alternative financial resources available to them. Most&#13;
households covered by the Zambia National Provident Fund (ZNPF) were&#13;
unaware that they could apply before retirement age for a portion of the&#13;
money already paid into their employer's social security system.&#13;
It was not until 1979, when participants exhausted their loans, that they&#13;
applied for and secured such assistance. The ZNPF was virtually the only&#13;
available alernative source of financing. Employer loans became entangled&#13;
in administrative misunderstandings between employees and Project managers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
Banks were also reluctant to give loans because of the low-income status&#13;
of most Project beneficiaries.&#13;
The necessary increase in the average loan size was not&#13;
matched by an increase in the loan funds, so that it was necessary&#13;
to decrease the number of loans available for squatter upgrading,&#13;
and a greater burden was put on the already inefficient loan repayment&#13;
collection system. However, none of these difficulties prevented the&#13;
achievement of the main Project goals which the loan program was meant to&#13;
facilitate.&#13;
Material Stores&#13;
The HPU material stores proved to be an essential element&#13;
in Project operations. Other private sources of materials existed, but&#13;
the goods they provided were more expensive and project residents believed&#13;
them to be of inferior quality. Despite their willing reliance on the&#13;
material stores, beneficiaries also found reasons to be critical of&#13;
their operation.  Problems most often cited included irregular store&#13;
hours, shortages of materials, and shortages of staff to handle high&#13;
volume periods. Inadequate transportation and rationing to compensate for&#13;
shortages resulted in long periods of wasted time for beneficiaries.&#13;
Short-term measures enacted in 1977 to deal with these problems&#13;
included giving purchasing priority to resettled households, making daily&#13;
announcements of materials available, and placing a moratorium on new&#13;
invoices until the backlog was cleared. These measures achieved some&#13;
success in improving the operation of the stores,and led as well to&#13;
development of a system for delivering concrete blocks directly to groups&#13;
of five or more participants who had ordered them. 6/&#13;

In evaluating the operation of the material stores it can&#13;
be seen that the efficiency with which they were able to operate was&#13;
constrained by a number of external factors such as the inability&#13;
of local markets to cope with the volume of orders and poor planning&#13;
for provision of raw materials. However, undoubtedly the main problem&#13;
derived from much greater than expected demand for materials.   Richard&#13;
Martin states:&#13;
"In my view the biggest single planning mistake&#13;
in the project was the assumption that people&#13;
would build in sun dried bricks. We knew there&#13;
was a tendency to use concrete blocks, but&#13;
supposed that we would be able to educate people&#13;
back into the use of (improved) sun-dried brick&#13;
construction i.e. with concrete block plinths,&#13;
proper foundations and the like. In fact our&#13;
educational efforts fell on stony ground, and&#13;
even the CDAs did not really believe that sun-&#13;
dried brick could be a durable material, and re-&#13;
inforced the general belief that concrete block&#13;
was the only appropriate material. This in turn&#13;
lead to the incredible pressures on the stores.&#13;
By way of illustration, the Appraisal Report&#13;
specifies one tractor per store; this might have&#13;
been enough if only roof sheeting, timber and&#13;
doors were required, with a small quantity of&#13;
blocks. I doubt it, but three would certainly&#13;
have coped. As it was six could not cope with&#13;
the demand, and transport and handling of&#13;
concrete blocks accounted for the major bottleneck&#13;
in the stores process. Besides costing extra&#13;
capital in the form of buying extra tractors,&#13;
we also had to take on extra storekeepers and&#13;
laborers." 7/&#13;

CHAPTER NINE: PROJECT FINANCE&#13;
Affordability&#13;
At the Project design stage, estimates of the target population's&#13;
ability to pay for proposed housing options were based on the assumption&#13;
that low-income households would be willing and able to spend 25% of&#13;
their monthly income on housing and related services. It was further&#13;
assumed that the previously illegal squatter households would be motivated&#13;
to improve their housing situation once they were issued occupancy&#13;
licences and leasehold titles for their land. At the time of Project&#13;
Appraisal (1974), it was evident that implementation of the Second&#13;
National Development Plan shelter program was far behind schedule,&#13;
so it appeared that the middle-income group for which that project&#13;
was intended, would be placing additional pressure on the housing&#13;
market. The expected monthly charges for various housing schemes were&#13;
derived on the assumption that price increases between the time of&#13;
appraisal and the time of implementation would not be more than 32%.&#13;
Estimates of individual families ability to pay for Project&#13;
housing were arrived at by calculating whether the monthly cost of&#13;
housing was less than or equal to a family-s monthly earnings multiplied&#13;
by the proportion of its income the family was presumed willing and able&#13;
to spend on housing. The accessibility of different Project housing&#13;
options was appraised on the basis of the expected range of monthly&#13;
payments for various levels of project participation, and a percentage&#13;
distribution by monthly income categories of all households living in&#13;
low-cost housing areas of Zambia in 1973. These figures are displayed in&#13;

Evaluation Findings: Affordability&#13;
The exorbitant price increases that have progressively eroded&#13;
the purchasing power of a pay-packet in Zambia may have undermined&#13;
the validity of the original assumption that all low-income households&#13;
would be willing and able to spend 25% of their income on housing&#13;
consumption. A household budget survey, conducted by the Central&#13;
Statistical Office in 1974-75 indicated that the reported expenditure&#13;
on housing as a percentage of monthly income for all urban households&#13;
varied between 1% and 9.4%. This survey may not be an accurate reflection&#13;
of Project participants' spending patterns, however, because its figures&#13;
were average for a sample including both tenants making regular monthly&#13;
outlay for housing and owner-occupiers in squatter areas who have no such&#13;
monthly payments to make.&#13;
Without meaningful information on monthly expenditure on housing&#13;
by low-income households in Zambia, we can mention some international&#13;
data to provide some context. A recent study showed that higher income&#13;
families tend to spend a smaller proportion of income on housing than do&#13;
poorer families and that owners are willing to spend a higher proportion&#13;
of their income than renters. 1/ On the basis of such findings the&#13;
original Project assumption as to the percentage of income a family is&#13;
willing to spend on housing might have to be revised.&#13;
A study conducted in Lusaka in 1977 by the Professional&#13;
and Technical Manager of the National Housing Authority arrived at the&#13;
following estimates: households with monthly incomes not exceeding 60&#13;

Consumption", Urban and Regional Economics Division. The World&#13;
Bank. 1980.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
Kwacha have 10 percent of income available for housing; those with&#13;
monthly incomes between 61 and 199 Kwacha have 15 percent of their income&#13;
available for housing; and the proportion is 25 percent for households&#13;
earning over 200 Kwacha per month. 2/&#13;
By April, 1979, about 750 applicants from the middle and upper&#13;
middle income groups had been refused plots in Project areas, because, in&#13;
keeping with Project objectives, 50% of the serviced plots had already&#13;
been allocated to households in those income brackets. This raises the&#13;
possibility that a significant number of low-income households already&#13;
residing in Project areas might be "bought out" by higher-income families.&#13;
Surveys conducted in Chawama and George overspill areas in March, 1977,&#13;
and February 1979 indicated a trend of ownership turnover from low-income&#13;
to higher income families. 3/ The trend is similar in the sites and&#13;
services areas, where HPU monitoring records an authorized 3% ownership&#13;
turnover, and,accepts another 2 to 3% of possible unauthorized sales.&#13;
The records of sales indicate that the income bracket of newly purchasing&#13;
families is consistently higher than that of sellers, and that net&#13;
profits from such sales have been in the area of 100% to 120%. It is&#13;
important to note that this phenomenon does not necessarily mean the&#13;
poorer families were unable to afford the project. They may have made&#13;
a rational decision to sell and make a capital gain.&#13;
Assuming that payment records of monthly service charges&#13;
and materials loans can serve as indicators of affordability, the payment&#13;
records of 230 households in Chawama upgraded and overspill areas were&#13;

cross-tabulated against respondents- declared monthly incomes in 1979.&#13;
The cross-tabulation did not yield a significant relationship between the&#13;
default rate and the monthly income of respondents. In other words, the&#13;
overall poor payment record was not indicative of households' inability&#13;
to pay. However, responses to the survey did indicate that between 15%&#13;
and 20% of the households in upgraded and overspill areas may occasionally&#13;
not be able to afford the monthly payment for service charges due to&#13;
unforeseen expenses, or periods of unemployment.&#13;
Table 9.3 calculates hypothetical expenditures on housing&#13;
consumption by residents of George upgraded and overspill areas and the&#13;
Lilanda basic sites and services project, assuming they are willing to&#13;
spend 10%, 15%, and 25% of their monthly income, respectively. In the&#13;
George upgraded areas on the basis of these figures between 1.6% and 5.9%&#13;
of the families could not afford the K3 service charge (depending upon&#13;
whether it was assumed the family could pay 25% or 10% of their income&#13;
for housing). In the overspill areas no families should have affordability&#13;
problems.&#13;
In an attempt to identify the causes of some households'&#13;
abandoning their plots in overspill areas, a study was conducted in&#13;
April, 1978, of 101 plots that had been abandoned in the Chawama overspill&#13;
area. 4/ The findings indicate that 34% of the residents that had&#13;
abandoned their plots had been tenants, 10% were female-headed households,&#13;
21% were single, and 18% were self-employed. According to this study,&#13;
income did not seem to be a significant factor influencing families'&#13;
decision to abandon their plots, since only one household fell into the&#13;

lowest income group, and the mean income of these families was 107&#13;
Kwacha, as compared to a mean income of 81 Kwacha for a sample of the&#13;
rest of the population in the Chawama overspill area.&#13;
At the present stage of Project implementation, with only&#13;
60% of the plots allocated, it may be premature to draw conclusions&#13;
regarding the affordability of the various sites and services options to&#13;
their target groups. Refering to Table 9.4 below, the following inferences&#13;
may be made concerning Site 5 (basic sites and services): assuming that&#13;
households are willing and able to pay 15% of their monthly income for&#13;
housing, 79.5% of households can afford a basic plot of 324 M2. Normal&#13;
plots of the same size could be afforded by 38.5% of the same households,&#13;
and "expensive" normal plots of the same size can be afforded by less&#13;
than 30%.&#13;
These inferences should be accepted with caution because&#13;
the household distribution by income categories in Site 5 (Lilanda)&#13;
may not be a representative sample of the distribution of low-income&#13;
households in the city of Lusaka. However, the data from Lilanda (1980)&#13;
is probably more relevant than the figures for household distribution by&#13;
income according to the 1976-77 household budget survey, which is the&#13;
only data currently available in Zambia.&#13;
Some indications of the attractiveness of the different&#13;
sites and services schemes are reflected in the rate of application&#13;
and occupancy of the plots by households of different income groups.&#13;
The foregoing table shows that, up until now, except for Site 6,&#13;
all the other schemes have significant percentages of households whose&#13;
monthly income falls below the median income of low-income households in&#13;
Lusaka.&#13;

A final factor which must be taken into account in evaluating&#13;
project affordability is the fact that the improved quality of the&#13;
dwellings enables families to obtain a significant income from sub-&#13;
letting one or more rooms. Table 10.4 (Chapter 10) shows than in&#13;
George 14 percent of families reported receiving income from rent and&#13;
that among this group the poorest 20 percent of families were obtaining&#13;
an average of 25 percent of their total income from the rent of part of&#13;
their houses. On average all families in the lowest half of the income&#13;
distribution in George were receiving at least 20 percent of their&#13;
income from rent. The information presently available does not permit&#13;
us to estimate how much this rental income has increased as a result&#13;
of the project it would be reasonable to assume that it may have increased&#13;
by at least 50 percent. If this were the case then the income of the&#13;
poorest 10 percent of families (earning less than K45 per month) would&#13;
have increased by K10; and the income for the next 30 percent of families&#13;
would have increased by almost K20. In all cases the increase in rental&#13;
income would be sufficient to cover the basic project charges. It must&#13;
be remembered that only 14 percent of families stated they were sub-letting&#13;
rooms (although the real figure is probably higher) but this is clearly&#13;
an important factor in the evaluation of affordability.&#13;
Cost Recovery: Design Assumptions&#13;
At the appraisal stage, analyses of records pertaining to&#13;
existing sites and services areas showed poor rates of payment. The&#13;
method of collection and the prevailing attitude of residents towards&#13;
government debits were taken to be key factors that would affect the&#13;
collection process. It was assumed that the repayment rate could be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
improved with the revision of the Rent Act of 1972, which restored the&#13;
LCC's authority to evict tenants for default, and by incorporating the&#13;
local UNIP section leaders into the collection system, making them&#13;
responsible for the payments of 25 households in each of their sections.&#13;
As the HPU was set up to implement a capital project and not&#13;
to be responsible for local government in the area thereafter, collection&#13;
of service charges and loan repayments would be the responsibility&#13;
of the City Treasurer s Department. Accordingly, it was stated at the&#13;
outset that the distinction between the HPU as developer and the City&#13;
Treasurer as collector was to be clear and firm.&#13;
It was decided that one combined service charge would be levied&#13;
to cover all capital and services charges. Table 9.5 shows the way this&#13;
charge was estimated at the time of appraisal. The basic charge was&#13;
originally estimated to be K 2.75 (this was later rounded to K 3) and&#13;
if the family took out a material loan the maximum payment could be&#13;
K5.10 per month. For the first time in Zambia these figures covered&#13;
the full project cost and did not include any subsidy element.&#13;
Where possible the payments would be deducted at source. Where&#13;
this could not be done the groups of 25 families benefitting from a&#13;
communal standpipe would be made collectively responsible for payments.&#13;
If any one family defaulted the water would be turned off with the&#13;
expectation that the social pressure from the remaining families would&#13;
force the defaulter to pay so that the water would be turned on again.&#13;
It was intended that the UNIP sections would be actively involved in&#13;
the collection process. As an incentive to pay on time, the group&#13;
would receive a rebate if all payments were received by the 10th of&#13;
the month.&#13;

Although families would be briefed on the reasons for pay-&#13;
ments, it was decided not to explain in detail the breakdown of the&#13;
payment charge as it was felt that too much detail would cause&#13;
confusion.&#13;
It was agreed that the full charge would not be introduced&#13;
until the work of the contractor was completed and the families were&#13;
receiving all of the services. Until that point a temporary service&#13;
charge of Kl would be charged. The work of the contractors was&#13;
planned to be completed in 1977 at which time the full charges would&#13;
be introduced.&#13;
The system for collection of materials loan repayments was&#13;
to rely on participants' responses to briefing by Community Development&#13;
officers. The loans, given in the form of credit for building materials,&#13;
were to be repaid individually, and it was expected that monthly payments&#13;
would be deducted at the source of employment wherever possible.&#13;
Evaluation Findings: Cost Recovery&#13;
Table 9.6 presents the cost recovery position of the HPU&#13;
Project in March 1980. It can be seen that in most of the Project areas&#13;
there are serious cost recovery problems. In Chawama, for example, 29&#13;
percent of families were at least 9 months in arrears on service charge&#13;
payments, and 71 percent were over 9 months in arrears on loan repayments.&#13;
In George the corresponding figures were 11 percent and 58 percent&#13;
respectively. The position appears to be somewhat better in the sites&#13;
and services areas although the arrearage is still considerable.&#13;

To evaluate the cost recovery performance of the Project&#13;
it is useful to make a comparison with the experience of other housing&#13;
projects. 5/ The LCC owned a considerable amount of low-income rental&#13;
accommodation. The cost recovery performance of many of these projects&#13;
had been very poor. Under the earlier Rent Control Act it had been&#13;
necessary to take a tenant to court before eviction was possible and the&#13;
courts almost always recommended deferred payment terms rather than&#13;
eviction. As a result the default rates were high. The LCC never used&#13;
eviction in any of its sites and services projects, partly because of&#13;
unwillingness to evict someone from a house they had built themselves.&#13;
As the Council was left without sanctions, default rates were again high.&#13;
In one particularly bad month, only 100 of the 1900 residents in Kaunda&#13;
Square made their monthly payments. In another case the Council staff&#13;
were chased out of the project by angry families who said they would not&#13;
pay until the roads were improved.&#13;
The Council also had experimented with collecting service&#13;
charges in several squatter settlements but in most cases the payment&#13;
rate was low (Martin estimates normally less than 60 percent of families&#13;
paid).&#13;
The LHPET study has identified several probable causes&#13;
for the high default rates in the LCC's project areas. First, the&#13;
LCC did not have the capacity to administer an effective collection&#13;
system. It lacked the necessary staff, organizational planning, and an&#13;
adequate computer. Further, the LCC imposed no sanctions for default and&#13;
5/   Most of the information on cost recovery in other projects is taken&#13;
from Richard Martin "Cost Recovery" (op. cit.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

provided no incentives for early or timely payment. The willingness of&#13;
participants in the Lusaka Project to make payments was adversely affected&#13;
by the fact that households renting in other sites and services areas&#13;
were accustomed to being in arrears for months or even years, without any&#13;
sanctions imposed upon them. Occasionally letters were sent to defaulting&#13;
families in these other areas, but due to inadequate and often incorrect&#13;
records, this procedure did not yield results. The impact of area&#13;
housing officers, who are responsible for briefing families on payment in&#13;
time, was negligible, primarily due to their meagre influence and&#13;
lack of proper organizational backup. Turning off water supplies for&#13;
defaulting families in the LCC administered areas has not even been&#13;
attempted because the local politicians have expressed their disapproval&#13;
and the LCC was too concerned about the political unrest such,a tactic&#13;
might generate in its project areas.&#13;
An LHPET study of 250 households, and extensive interviews&#13;
with HPU and LCC officials identified several causes for the high&#13;
default rates in the Lusaka Project areas. These are not surprisingly&#13;
related to the causes of default in the LCC's previous projects. The&#13;
social pressure system" of turning off water in case one or more families&#13;
in a section fail to pay monthly charges discouraged good payers and&#13;
failed to motivate or even to punish the defaulters. This policy suffered&#13;
also from the lack of any formal contract between the section households&#13;
and the LCC regarding their collective responsibility for payment of&#13;
service charges. Enforcement of this sanction was also ineffective&#13;
because affected householders restarted the flow of water themselves by&#13;
removing stop corks or breaking protective covers.   The social pressure&#13;

that might have been applied by the reliable payers did not work since&#13;
the identity of the defaulting families was generally not known to&#13;
them.&#13;
The section chairmen proved not to be motivated payment&#13;
collectors because they have no incentives to offer and feared a zealous&#13;
approach would only lead to unpopularity among their constituents. In&#13;
fact, with the increase of the monthly service charge to 3 Kwacha in&#13;
Chawama, section leaders have actually mobilized people in opposing the&#13;
increase. Most families are not aware of the actual breakdown of the&#13;
service charge, and the incentive of issuing occupancy licenses has had a&#13;
minimal impact in persuading families to pay the service charge increase.&#13;
As of June, 1980, only 125 families out of 7,400 had cleared all their&#13;
arrears to be eligible for occupancy licences. 6/&#13;
A further cause of residents refusal to pay is their dissatis-&#13;
faction with street lighting and with the City Council's refusal to&#13;
collect garbage in upgraded areas. Part of the residents- frustration may&#13;
be due to the high expectations raised by the Community Development&#13;
officers who so effectively "sold" the Project to communities as part of&#13;
the effort to minimize their resistance to the implementation process.&#13;
The absence of real sanctions against default seems to be&#13;
the major reason for the poor rate of loan repayment. Though it had been&#13;
expected at the design stage that the statutory and Improvement Areas Act&#13;
would empower the LCC to impose sanctions against defaulters, close&#13;
scrutiny of the Act has revealed various loopholes and ambiguities that&#13;
need to be clarified before any punitive action can be taken. 7/&#13;

Inadequate briefing prior to issuing of loans, lack of briefing&#13;
before repayment was to start, irregular dispatch of quarterly statements&#13;
of arrears to participants, and insufficient warning notices to defaulters&#13;
have all been the result of inadequate Community Development staff&#13;
working under tremendous pressure to promote a unique project to families,&#13;
and a slow response of the Collection Unit, where accounts of more than&#13;
25,000 families were processed manually.&#13;
Finally, at-source deduction for all willing participants has not been&#13;
possible because of the refusal of most employers to cooperate.&#13;

PART FOUR: PROJECT IMPACT&#13;
CHAPTER TEN: IMPACT ON PARTICIPANTS&#13;
Although evidence that the Project's improvements have had&#13;
positive effect on the physical environment of Lusaka can hardly be&#13;
disputed, some Zambian planners and government officials have expressed&#13;
concern that, by producing low-cost housing, the Project might encourage&#13;
unemployed and unproductive families to migrate to or remain in the city,&#13;
whereas they might be more productively employed in rural areas. Concern&#13;
has also been expressed about the low quality of the houses. The first&#13;
section of this chapter will review the available evidence on these&#13;
issues as well as discussing other impacts on participants.&#13;
Table 10.1 shows that Project participants tend to represent a&#13;
wide sector of the low income population. While almost 60% of the George&#13;
population comes from the lowest 20% of the urban income distribution,&#13;
the figure is only 35% for Lilanda, and 15% for Matero. 1/ (For purposes&#13;
of analysis, these three Project areas have been selected as representing&#13;
respectively the main shelter options offered. These figures show that&#13;
each project area is serving a different income group, so that among them&#13;
they cover most of the poorest 50% to 60% of the urban population. This&#13;
wide spread is evidence that although the upgrading projects are reaching&#13;
the lowest income groups, the program as a whole has offered an integrated&#13;
approach to the urban housing problem. It is clearly not the case that&#13;
the Project has appealed only to the poorest or economically least&#13;
productive dwellers.&#13;

characteristics of families in the Sites and Services projects.&#13;

- 149 -&#13;
Regarding participants' sources of income, we have data on&#13;
only two areas, Lilanda and George. Table 10.2 shows that in both&#13;
areas almost all household income is generated through wages or salary.&#13;
The rates of open unemployment of household heads tend to be under 7% in&#13;
most areas.&#13;
The second most important source of household income in&#13;
Lilanda is part-time work, mostly on the part of women selling vegetables.&#13;
In the case of George, the second most important income source is represented&#13;
by donations from relatives and friends, closely followed by rents.&#13;
Although gifts and income transfers do not represent a numerically&#13;
important source of income for the whole community, (approximately 2.5%&#13;
in the case of George) the varied sources of income again dispel the&#13;
notion that Project areas are pockets of stagnation. Similar findings on&#13;
the importance of income transfers to low-income families have been found&#13;
in other countries. 2/&#13;
Table 10.3 shows that most donations come from participants&#13;
relatives or friends living in other parts of Lusaka. The second&#13;
most frequent source of income transfers is families in the same Project&#13;
area, indicating strong family links or solidarity amongst neighbors.&#13;
Virtually none of the transfers come from rural areas. As far as the&#13;
magnitude of donations is concerned, the same table shows that they&#13;
typically account for about 15% of recipients household incomes.&#13;

Table 10.4 presents an analysis of the importance of rental&#13;
income to the 14 percent of families in George who declared income from&#13;
rent in 1980. For these families 12.1 percent of total income is&#13;
obtained from rent. This is an important impact of the project on the&#13;
income of the urban poor. Although only 14 percent declared this source&#13;
of income the true proportion of families receiving rental income is&#13;
probably higher and income generated by rents appears to vary significantly&#13;
according to the socio-economic characteristics of the recipients, as we&#13;
can see from the same Table. For female household heads, in this group&#13;
rental income represented a quarter of household income, whereas for&#13;
males it accounted for only about 11%. Thus, in the absence of other&#13;
opportunities, fluctuations in rental income will have a much greater&#13;
effect on households headed by women.&#13;
With respect to overall household income distribution, the&#13;
table shows that in George rental income constitutes a more important&#13;
source of revenue for poorer households than for more prosperous ones.&#13;
Of those households collecting rents, for the lowest-20th percentile,&#13;
rental income constitutes about 26% of total household income, while for&#13;
the top 10th percentile, rental income accounts for only 5% of total&#13;
household income. The major policy implication of this finding is that&#13;
eliminating rental incomes will hurt poorer families more than affluent&#13;
ones. Moreover, the available data does not confirm the preconception&#13;
of rich landlords collecting most of their incomes from rent. In fact,&#13;
landlords seem to be evenly distributed among all income groups.&#13;
The occupational records of the heads of households in the&#13;
three project areas shows that the level of open unemployment is very low&#13;

(1.3% in Matero: 2.4% in Lilanda; and 2.7% in George). This finding too&#13;
refutes the image of the Project areas as concentrations of economically&#13;
unproductive individuals. Table 10.5 presents the occupational distribution&#13;
of household heads and shows its wide diversity. Table 10.6 shows&#13;
furthermore that the individuals in question are not newcomers to the&#13;
workforce. Three quarters of them have worked full time for over five&#13;
years.&#13;
In Lilanda, among families who were asked what effect the&#13;
Project had had on their income, 38% said their incomes had improved, 35%&#13;
reckoned themselves worse off, and 27% remarked no change as a result of&#13;
their participation.&#13;
Again in Lilanda, 38% of survey respondents said that living&#13;
in the project area had reduced their expenditures for housing. Meanwhile,&#13;
in George, a study showed that the cost of housing investment has not&#13;
reduced expenditures on food and other basic necessities. 3/&#13;
Housing quality&#13;
The quality of Project houses is relatively high. Walls&#13;
are made of concrete block or burnt brick in 89.5% of the Matero houses,&#13;
of concrete brick in 99.2% of the Lilanda houses, and of sundried brick&#13;
or concrete block in 91.4% of the George houses. Roofs are made of&#13;
asbestos cement in 95.4% of Matero houses, 98.4% in Lilanda.&#13;
Evaluation studies have also tried to measure beneficiaries'&#13;
own degree of satisfaction with Project housing. Tables 10.7 and&#13;
10.9 indicate the preponderantly positive response of Project families to&#13;

changes in their circumstances resulting from participation. A sizeable&#13;
majority rated Project housing an improvement over comparable LCC past&#13;
projects, and a similar proportion felt that the new Project infrastructure&#13;
was good. Table 10.8 gives an idea of the changes residents have enjoyed&#13;
in their water supply since moving from their previous houses into&#13;
Project areas, or since the beginning of upgrading.&#13;
A final question to be asked is whether the more favorable&#13;
conditions in the project areas have served to attract more people&#13;
to Lusaka. A stated goal of government policy is to discourage rural to&#13;
urban migration, and some concern has been expressed that the Project may&#13;
work contrary to planning objectives in this respect. Although it was&#13;
beyond the scope of the present evaluation to be able to conduct a&#13;
macro-economic analysis of migration, a number of indicators are available&#13;
to throw some light on this issue. In general, the available evidence does&#13;
not indicate that the project has had any impact on migration patterns.&#13;
First, the large majority of families had come to Lusaka long before the&#13;
project began. In George, 63 percent had arrived before 1970 and 81&#13;
percent before 1974. In Lilanda the corresponding proportions were 64&#13;
percent and 91 percent. When asked why they had come to Lusaka in the&#13;
first place, 71 percent in George said they had come seeking employment,&#13;
and 21 percent to join family. Less than 3 percent cited better housing&#13;
as one of their reasons. In Lilanda 91 percent gave employment as their&#13;
reason for having moved and no one mentioned housing.&#13;
These figures seem to indicate that the project was not the cause&#13;
of project residents having come to Lusaka. Most of them were living&#13;

in the city before the Project began and most of the others indicated&#13;
they had come to the city looking for work, not for housing. Even though&#13;
the project was not the motivating force in the migration of present&#13;
residents, it has been suggested that the effect of families moving out&#13;
of the upgrading areas may have been to encourage new families to migrate&#13;
and occupy the vacated plots. Tables 10.10 and 10.11 present evidence&#13;
that population density does not appear to have increased in George&#13;
between 1975 and 1970. The first of these tables shows that the number&#13;
of families per building has remained almost constant at 1.55, while the&#13;
second shows that the median household size has remained at around four&#13;
people. These figures are consistent with the Schlyter study which found&#13;
an average of 6.3 persons per house in 1977 (which is consistent with the&#13;
above findings if we muLtiply average family size by 1.55 families per&#13;
house). 4/ The Schlyter study did, however, find an increase in the&#13;
number of people per house from 4.9 in 1969 to 6.3 in 1977. However, as&#13;
this increase in family size mainly took place before 1973 it cannot be&#13;
attributed to the Project.&#13;

CHAPTER ELEVEN: PROJECT IMPACT ON THE CITY OF LUSAKA&#13;
As a result of Project implementation, the housing stock&#13;
of Lusaka is being increased by 11,500 units, and almost 20,000 existing&#13;
dwellings have been improved through access to water, roads, and garbage&#13;
collection. Table 11.1 shows that by a reasonably conservative estimate&#13;
about K15 million has been added to the value of the housing stock as a&#13;
result of the Project.&#13;
The upgrading of squatter areas did not change the land-use&#13;
of those particular areas. In the case of the sites and services&#13;
schemes, some urban land had to be taken over that had formerly been&#13;
cultivated by low-income households. (However, this change of land use&#13;
may ultimately result in reduced food costs for residents of what are now&#13;
project areas, as serviced plots allow space for household gardens.) The&#13;
location of the sites and services schemes was consistent with the&#13;
Government circular calling for the creation of neighborhoods that would&#13;
integrate residents of widely different income groups. The movement&#13;
towards integrated housing has not been easy, as the relatively affluent&#13;
residents resisted having "the thieves" brought closer to their homes.&#13;
However, the newly formed communities have proved to be surprisingly&#13;
stable, and in some of them crime rates have actually been declining. 1/&#13;
As all the project houses are numbered and the identity of their occupants&#13;
known, it has become much easier for city authorities to trace the&#13;
whereabouts of residents.&#13;

affect the financial position of the Lusaka City Council. According&#13;
to the acting Treasurer for the Council, the average annual revenue from&#13;
the Project areas so far has been in the range of 490,000 Kwacha, while,&#13;
according to the terms of the original Project agreement, the LCC is&#13;
supposed to repay 1.9 million Kwacha annually to the Central Government. 2/&#13;
Moreover, the LCC is expected to maintain and further upgrade the&#13;
Project areas, with the annual cost of maintenance expected to be in the&#13;
range of 0.5 to 0.75 million Kwacha. Analysis of HPU accounts indicate&#13;
that since 1977, the amount of revenue generated annually does not even&#13;
cover one third of the annual operating cost. 3/&#13;
Problems with cost recovery, however, do not alter the fact&#13;
that the Lusaka Project has significantly increased the potential&#13;
revenue base of the city. If the LCC had followed the World Bank's&#13;
suggested guidelines for reviewing property taxes, housing rents,&#13;
and the tariffs for sewerage and water consumption, its financial&#13;
position would presently have been considerably stronger than it is, even&#13;
with a high rate of default in the upgraded areas.&#13;
Political Impact&#13;
The major effect of the Lusaka Project, from the perspective&#13;
of the poorer city dwellers- political position, is to have won legal&#13;
status for the squatters who were Project beneficiaries. The reformulation&#13;
of the laws regarding squatter settlements, which began with the issuing&#13;
of occupancy licenses and leasehold titles, betokens a regrouping of&#13;
political forces in recognition of the political potential of the growing&#13;
number of urban poor.&#13;

From the viewpoint of the urban poor not included in the&#13;
Lusaka Project, its successes have demonstrated the flexibility and&#13;
realism of the existing powers. The Project has shown the city-s poor&#13;
population that with aspiration and cooperation, they too may eventually&#13;
be included in the dominant, decision-making sector of society. Local&#13;
politicians already have plans for channeling positively what the Mayor&#13;
of Lusaka has called the new "general awareness" among the city's low-&#13;
income residents.&#13;
The political awareness among Project participants has also&#13;
increased as a result of their involvement in the implementation process,&#13;
and residents of the upgraded areas are now less dependent upon and&#13;
controlled by the local leaders. They have become increasingly vocal&#13;
about their choices in local meetings dealing with developmental issues.&#13;
Local leaders, some of whom previously tried to allocate plots or evict&#13;
people according to their own whims or interests, are now careful not to&#13;
alienate the residents who now possess a sense of access to authorities&#13;
they did not previously have. In other words, the Lusaka Project has&#13;
helped its participants develop a political consciousness that has not&#13;
led to an increase in political tension.&#13;
Impact on social structure&#13;
According to surveys carried out by the LHPET in George&#13;
upgraded area in 1976, 1977, and 1979, there has not been any significant&#13;
change in the composition of the participant families. The data on mean&#13;
household size indicates a slight drop from 4.48 in 1976 to 4.23 in 1979,&#13;
which is consistent with findings in other countries and tends to&#13;
support the conclusion that upgrading has not promoted rural to urban&#13;
migration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 163 -&#13;
The relationship between the dominant elite and the residents&#13;
of Lusaka upgraded areas is not only political in nature, but also&#13;
strongly social. A significant number of the men and women now involved&#13;
in making policy have come from the same villages as many residents of&#13;
the squatter compounds. Some of the closest kin of the new elite live in&#13;
the upgraded areas and are often involved in petty trading or other&#13;
informal sector jobs. Recently, houses in the overspill areas have been&#13;
purchased by members of the Central Committee for close relatives. 4/&#13;
Such facts may help to explain the reluctance of the City Council to take&#13;
strong punitive action against defaulters in Project areas.&#13;
Employment Generation and Business&#13;
Employment generation was not a major objective of the Lusaka&#13;
Project. However, there was some expectation that by its very scope and&#13;
magnitude the Project would produce some new sources of employment, in&#13;
addition to that expected in the process of house construction. The&#13;
Project design also included setting aside some land for small industrial&#13;
sites as well as markets.&#13;
Experience with the industrial sites has not been very successful.&#13;
Although 294 applications had been received by 1979 for the 100 business&#13;
plots advertised in Chawama, George, and Matero, and 81 were approved in&#13;
George and Matero, only 10 have completed their structures and 13 are in&#13;
the process of building. Thus the commitment ratio (completed structures&#13;
plus in-process-of-building over total approved applicants) in these two&#13;
areas amounts to only 28%. Table 11.2 shows the state of development&#13;
three years after the business plots were first advertised.&#13;

There are several reasons for the poor record of development&#13;
of the industrial plots. Unlike Project beneficiaries who were given&#13;
loans to build their own houses, prospective businessmen had to rely on&#13;
their own funds or sources of commercial credit. The high building&#13;
standards required by the HPU and LCC discouraged many prospective&#13;
businesses, since they were not allowed access to HPU material stores.&#13;
Many businessmen were reluctant to invest in locations as remote from&#13;
regular customers as most Project business plots were. The lack of an&#13;
adequate transportation system, and a certain resistance of the communities&#13;
to newcomers were further considerations tending to discourage many&#13;
prospective investors. Not advertised along with the plots themselves&#13;
was the fact that the plots were not provided with. water or electricity,&#13;
necessitating further expenses on the part of the private developer.&#13;
Small industries and shops seem to have fared better, almost&#13;
half the plots alloted for these purposes having been developed. The&#13;
industrial plot sizes varied from 25 to 875 square meters, giving ample&#13;
flexibility for various types of business to set up, but the lack of&#13;
services limited their appeal to small proprietors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 165 -&#13;
From these findings, it can be easily inferred that the&#13;
level of employment generated by new businesses has been miniscule.&#13;
As far as markets are concerned, all evidence suggests that their develop-&#13;
ment and employment generation potential are independent of the specific&#13;
designs prepared by the HPU. In mid-1978, the three market sites developed&#13;
by the HPU in Lilanda, Chipata, and Chawama South had a total of 762&#13;
vendors working in them, but it appears that almost all the vendors in&#13;
these markets were doing business long before the HPU constructed or&#13;
improved their new vending sites.&#13;
Unlike the industrial sites or market schemes, however,&#13;
the process of house construction contributed significantly, if temporarily,&#13;
to the level of employment. Table 11.3 shows that the great majority of&#13;
Project beneficiaries hired bricklayers and carpenters, spending significant&#13;
amounts of money in paying for their labor. While almost all the households&#13;
in the sites,land services areas used hired labor, only about a fourth&#13;
of those in the squatter and overspill areas paid for professional&#13;
construction help.&#13;
Since execution of the Project began, 8,010 man/months of hired&#13;
labor has been contracted by beneficiaries themselves, generating approximately&#13;
K880,000 of wage income. This high level of employment will continue,&#13;
however, only to the extent that the process of house construction and&#13;
consolidation becomes an ongoing one.&#13;
Transport&#13;
The realization of the Lusaka Project has significantly&#13;
affected the demand for transport between the project areas and the city&#13;
center. According to the Managing Director of the Lusaka Branch of the&#13;
United Bus Company of Zambia (UBZ), demand for transport between Chawama&#13;

and the center of the city has increased by 100% since the upgrading&#13;
process began. According to the Branch Manager, thc UBZ is not presently&#13;
in a position to respond to the new demand, because neither the LCC&#13;
nor the Central Government has ever discussed with officials of the bus&#13;
company plans for anticipating the increased transport needs. In the&#13;
absence of coordination between the Council and the UBZ, the present&#13;
state of transportation planning is "reactive" in nature. Without any&#13;
allocation for the UBZ in the Third National Development Plan, it is&#13;
virtually impossible for the bus company to cope with the rising demand&#13;
for its services.&#13;
The failure of the UBZ to provide the necessary transport has&#13;
resulted in a business boom for owners of private taxis and minibuses.&#13;
All the project areas are currently being served by minibuses and private&#13;
"shared taxis" which are increasingly competing with the UBZ and taking&#13;
away its passengers. Not surprisingly, the UBZ is unhappy about the&#13;
situation, since, as a formal monopoly organization, it expects the&#13;
informal sector to play only the subsidiary role of providing transport&#13;
for feeder roads. But as the operation of the minibuses and shared taxis&#13;
is more flexible, they are in general much quicker in reaching their&#13;
destinations, and a growing number of residents prefer to travel by&#13;
means of them, in spite of paying a little more than the standard UBZ&#13;
fares.&#13;

CHAPTER TWELVE:   IMPACT ON NATIONAL HOUSING POLICY&#13;
The impact of the First Lusaka Urban Development Project&#13;
on Zambian national housing policy is difficult to assess because&#13;
in spite of having had three National Development Plans, Zambia cannot&#13;
really be said to have a national housing policy. The plans, especially&#13;
the Third National Development Plan (1979-83), do contain analyses of&#13;
housing demand, but they lack a clear articulation of a delivery system&#13;
and of capacity constraints, both of which are absolutely vital to the&#13;
planning of a national housing policy. Thus the impact of the Lusaka&#13;
Project may have to be judged by its contribution to the process of&#13;
developing a national housing policy.&#13;
By the time of project appraisal, there were signs that&#13;
the country was ready to change its previous policy of demolishing&#13;
squatter housing wherever it appeared. The Second National Development&#13;
Plan (1972-76) had specifically recognized that "although the squatter&#13;
areas are unplanned, they nevertheless represent assets both in social&#13;
and finawcial terms. The areas require planning and services, and the&#13;
wholesale demolition of good and bad houses alike is not a practical&#13;
solution." Although the plan does not detail the possibilities of&#13;
realization, it nevertheless states that the housing needs of the low-income&#13;
urban population will be met with fully serviced plots. Despite the&#13;
SNDP's lack of concrete measures for achieving its stated housing goals,&#13;
its general approach was such that World Bank economic planners concluded:&#13;
"Bank assistance, starting with the project in Lusaka and later projects&#13;
in other cities and towns, would promote changes in national urban&#13;
shelter investment, initiate squatter upgrading and accelerate the SNDP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
site and service program    The First Lusaka Urban Development Project,&#13;
as envisioned by the Bank, was to be the starting point for a long&#13;
range urban housing program that was to set the tone for a national&#13;
housing policy.&#13;
Evaluation findings indicated that, contrary to the prescribed&#13;
long-range integrated approach to the low-income urban housing problem,&#13;
the Zambian approach was a perfect example of reactive planning. The&#13;
nation was constantly involved in reacting to crisis situations with&#13;
disjointed programs whose methods and results are forgotten until the&#13;
next crisis develops. Personal interviews revealed that there are some&#13;
Zambian policymakers who continue to view even the Lusaka Project as a&#13;
short-term solution to a temporary problem. This attitude of "disjointed&#13;
incrementalism" in national planning is symptomatic of the lack of&#13;
a national urban policy, without which no systematic national housing&#13;
policy can be formulated. Some of the major cities have their own master&#13;
plans which are static blueprints of desired land uses for the distant&#13;
future, unfocussed by any definition of national objectives. And in the&#13;
absence of a clear national policy of housing and urban planning goals,&#13;
local authorities cannot be expected to shift radically from their&#13;
customary policies.&#13;
Though the chances of the First Lusaka Urban Development&#13;
Project being integrated into a long range housing program appear to&#13;
remain bleak at present, the impact of this project on official thinking&#13;
about housing problems at the national level has been significant. Due&#13;
to the demonstration effect of the Lusaka Project, it is now widely&#13;
recognized and acknowledged that projects of this nature are feasible and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 170 -&#13;
can be implemented with broad public participation and investment on the&#13;
part of participant households. Even the Lusaka Project-s most severe&#13;
critics accept that its per capita cost has been considerably lower than&#13;
that of previous housing efforts. The Ministry of Local and Provincial&#13;
Government officially acknowledged the Lusaka Project's successes in&#13;
meeting the housing needs of its target population, in providing infra-&#13;
structural and social facilities as well as housing, in the efficiency&#13;
and effectiveness of its implementation, and in its unquestionable&#13;
success from the social point of view. 1/&#13;
The demonstration effect of the Lusaka Project is confirmed&#13;
by other events as well. The Kalingalinga upgrading project, financed by&#13;
a grant from the West German Government, is being designed on principles&#13;
very similar to those of the Lusaka Project. Even the dissimilarities,&#13;
such as the creation of a revolving fund for the gradual provision of&#13;
basic infrastructure are the results of lessons learned from the Lusaka&#13;
Project experience. Records of meetings held at the Ministry of Local&#13;
and Provincial Government indicate a genuine willingness on the part of&#13;
the Ministry to design future projects on the Lusaka model for medium-sized&#13;
cities. 2/ The National Housing Authority has also accepted the viability&#13;
of the Lusaka Project as a prototype in concluding that "although somewhat&#13;
slow in being implemented, the project has been undeniably successful and&#13;
is considered a model of its kind." 3/&#13;

Government, in a seminar on evaluation, March 20, 1980.&#13;

Land acquisition&#13;
By its very scale, the implementation of the Lusaka Project&#13;
has called attention to various constraints on the provision of housing.&#13;
The Lusaka Project's problems with land acquisition, 4/ for example, have&#13;
led to the following resolutions in the National Housing Policy Conference: 5/&#13;
* There is an urgent need to streamline the system of land&#13;
acquisition by placing the valuation, surveying, title, and registry&#13;
functions within a single agency. It was acknowledged that serious&#13;
delays in development have been caused by the inadequate performance&#13;
of the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, and particularly the Lands&#13;
Department.&#13;
* Adequate tracts of new land must be available for housing&#13;
in advance of their actual requirement. Provisions for land&#13;
should include both virgin land and land presently under private or&#13;
state ownership. Procedures for the timely acquisition of such land&#13;
should be established for the proposed new land banking agency and&#13;
by the strengthening of the Housing (Statutory and Improved Areas)&#13;
Act of 1974.&#13;
The Equity Issue&#13;
The poor cost recovery rate of the Lusaka Project has given&#13;
rise to discussions at the national level regarding possible horizontal&#13;
and vertical inequities in the housing sector. Because the Lusaka&#13;
Project was the first in which participants were required to pay the full&#13;
cost of on-site development and materials loans, the question of inequity&#13;
4/ Similar land acquisition problems have existed in nearly all World&#13;
Bank shelter programs.&#13;
5/ "Resolutions of the National Housing Policy Conference," March, 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 172 -&#13;
has also been raised by project participants who find households in other&#13;
sites and services areas with the same or better levels of services&#13;
paying less than half the rate of service charges they were asked to pay.&#13;
From the Government-s point of view, it is politically difficult, perhaps&#13;
even dangerous, to attempt to compel poorer people to pay the full cost&#13;
of their housing improvements when those better off are already enjoying&#13;
tacit or explicit subsidies. The World Bank has argued that the Zambian&#13;
government cannot really afford such subsidies as it has been extending&#13;
to previous housing programs, and that the only way to achieve a socially&#13;
just policy in the future is to maximize the involvement and responsibility&#13;
of project participants through a vigorous and equitable cost recovery&#13;
system.  The only shortcoming of the Bank's approach to this project is&#13;
that it did not provide for the phasing out of the existing pattern of&#13;
subsidies to keep such inequalities from arising or being intensified.&#13;
The debate on the question of equity has been most intense&#13;
on the issue of vertical inequities in the housing sector. According&#13;
to a recent study that took into account the various forms of direct&#13;
and indirect subsidies, including revenue forgone by charging sub-economic&#13;
rents, the total annual subsidy of housing, by the Central Government,&#13;
local authorities and parastatal organizations, is on the order of 90&#13;
million kwacha. 6/ The subsidy was broken down as follows:&#13;
Central Government           K 29.8 million&#13;
Local Government             K  4.6 million&#13;
Parastatal sector            K 60.7 million&#13;
Total              K 95.1 million&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -&#13;
The most striking aspect of this subsidy is its regressive&#13;
nature. Table 12.1 shows that the poorest 30 percent of the employees&#13;
of these three sectors only receive 1.8 percent of the total subsidy,&#13;
whilst at the other extreme the top 10 percent receive about 45 percent&#13;
of the total subsidies. The same table shows that whilst for the&#13;
bottom 30 percent the subsidy represents less than 15 percent of the&#13;
total employment benefit package, for the top 10 percent housing subsidies&#13;
represent.almost 40 percent of the total employment benefits. The same&#13;
point is made in another way in Figure 12.1. This figure compares each&#13;
income decile with the bottom decile in terms of earnings and in terms of&#13;
total employment benefits. Workers in the top income decile earn between&#13;
16 and 31 times as much as those in the lowest decile. However, when we&#13;
compare the total employment benefits the top decile now receives between&#13;
23 and 56 times as much as the bottom decile.&#13;
Commenting on the subsidy issue, a 1977 study by the International&#13;
Labor Organization concluded: "one obvious result of this policy of&#13;
subsidy is that persons already in higher income brackets receive large&#13;
monthly subsidies which in some cases are equivalent to anything from two&#13;
to twelve months salary for some categories of employees in the lower&#13;
income groups.'" 7/ 8/.&#13;
Implementation of the Lusaka Project has created the context&#13;
for redefinition of the existing structure of subsidies. That efforts at&#13;
such redefinition are already underway is affirmed, for example, in a&#13;
7/   International Labor Organization, "Narrowing the Gap:  Planning&#13;
for Basic Needs and Productive Employment in Zambia," Addis Ababa,&#13;
January, 1977, p. 144.&#13;
8/   Even if one accepts the argument that the subsidization of rents and&#13;
housing arose in Zambia essentially as a wage supplement (which is&#13;
true) and that the Government should continue, and can afford to&#13;
continue, viewing the matter thus (which it almost ce.rtainly cannot),&#13;
there is no justification for retaining the resulting vertical inequity.&#13;

statement by the Assistant Secretary (Finance) of the Ministry of&#13;
Local and Provincial Government to an HPU conference on evaluation, held&#13;
in March, 1980: "The provision of institutional and rental housing lead&#13;
to substantial subsidies which primarily go to the middle and higher&#13;
income groups. We have made attempts to convert large portions of such&#13;
housing to owner occupied housing but our rate of success in this field&#13;
is rather slow. It is in this respect that I would like to question the&#13;
wisdom of levying economic charges in respect of housing for the lowest&#13;
income group. It is clear that subsidized housing slows down investment&#13;
in new housing, but until such time as subsidies are completely removed&#13;
from householders in the high income groups, it may be necessary to&#13;
rechannel such subsidies from the high to very low income groups during&#13;
the transitional period."&#13;
A closely related type of subsidy called the "home-owners'&#13;
allowance" has also come into question since Lusaka Project participants&#13;
can now claim to be legal home-owners, once they receive occupancy&#13;
licenses and title deeds. At present, all employees of the Central&#13;
Government, the local authorities, the parastatal organizations and&#13;
private firms whose houses are formally registered are entitled to&#13;
receive a monthly home-owner's allowance based on the cost of one-s&#13;
house: the higher the cost of the house, the higher the monthly allowance.&#13;
Moreover, homeowners are also allowed tax deductions for the payment of&#13;
interest on their mortgage loans. At present, formal home ownership in&#13;
urban areas remains the privilege of no more than 5% of households, and&#13;
almost all recipients of home-owners' allowances belong to the high&#13;
income groups. 9/ The amounts of the allowances are quite significant.&#13;
9/ GRZ, Third National Development Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
For the recipients who earn between 400 and 500 Kwacha per month, the&#13;
average allowance amounts to approximately 25% of their monthly income. 10/&#13;
In :light of these facts and the government's professed willingness&#13;
to encourage home ownership, it has been argued that participants in the&#13;
Lusaka Project should be eligible for the house owners' subsidy.&#13;
The following facts bolster this argument for a way to introduce more&#13;
equitability into government sponsorship of housing:&#13;
*    The majority of Lusaka Project households are from the low-income&#13;
groups which the Third National Development Plan says should&#13;
receive highest priority and preferential treatment in housing&#13;
investment.&#13;
*    Project participants have shown a genuine interest in home&#13;
ownership. They have contributed to the national objective of&#13;
increasing the total number of owner-occupied dwellings by&#13;
self-sufficiency and by mobilizing their personal savings.&#13;
*    Participants are paying interest on building material loans,&#13;
though this is not tax deductible in their case.&#13;
*    Being in possession of occupancy licenses and formal leasehold&#13;
titles, the participating households qualify as formal home-owmers&#13;
of registered houses.&#13;
*    Like other home-owners, Project households are being asked to&#13;
pay property taxes ranging from 0.10 Kwacha per month in&#13;
upgraded areas to 0.50 in normal sites and services schemes.&#13;

THE DATA&#13;
Data for this report was collected by LHPET in late (November -&#13;
December) 1978 in Site 1, Matero. The final sample includes 153 randomly&#13;
selected households out of a total population of 624 households (25%&#13;
sample). Site 1 was designed to have a "normal" servicing level, that&#13;
is, plots with individual connections to water and sewerage, and to be&#13;
affordable to 70% of all low income households in Lusaka.&#13;
Although Site 1 is not the only Sites and Services area of the&#13;
Project, it is representative of all the areas with a "normal" level of&#13;
services. However, it does not represent plots with a "basic" level&#13;
of services. These plots only include communal water connections, and&#13;
were intended to be affordable to 95% of all low income households.&#13;
I. WHO THEY ARE&#13;
A. Income Distribution&#13;
As can be seen in Table 1 (Distribution of Urban Household&#13;
Income In Zambia - 1978), the target population (70% of all households)&#13;
is probably being reached. The mean income of residents in the Sites&#13;
and Services areas is Kwacha 166/month -- somewhat higher than the&#13;
mean income of residents in the squatter areas (K. 143/month) but&#13;
appreciably lower than the mean income of residents in low-cost housing&#13;
areas in general (K. 205/month). These figures indicate that the lower&#13;
middle income groups, rather than the wealthier urban residents, are the&#13;
primary beneficiaries of the Project, and also that the sites and services&#13;
residents have some income - generating advantage over the squatter&#13;
settlement residents.&#13;

1976. For 1978 we have adjusted the income intervals by the inflation rate and assumed&#13;
similar distribution.&#13;

B.   Distribution by Sex, Age, Marital Status, Family Size&#13;
and Education&#13;
The vast majority (96.7%) of the interviewed heads of household&#13;
are males. On the whole, they are young; 34% are between 26 and 30 years&#13;
old, 22% are 31-35 years old, and 22% are between 36 and 40 years old.&#13;
The mean age is 34.6; the median age is 31.5.&#13;
The data indicate that most of the households are of a stable,&#13;
nuclear family type. 86% of the household heads are married to one&#13;
spouse only; 6% are married to more than one spouse, and 5% are single.&#13;
The mean household size is 5.5 persons; the median size is 5.1 persons.&#13;
54% of the families have 4-6 persons; the breakdown is as follows:&#13;
21%, 4 persons; 21%, 5 persons; and 12%, 6 persons. The sites and&#13;
services households seem to be politically active; 71% of the house-&#13;
holds have 2 registered voters; an additional 20% have 1 voter; and 6%&#13;
have 3 voters.&#13;
AllPbut 4% of the household heads received some education.&#13;
59% of them had some secondary schooling; that is, they finished their&#13;
education after completing Grade 6, but before entering Form 5. To&#13;
mention the two extremes, 18% completed only some primary school (Grades&#13;
1-5) and 11% completed basic secondary school (Form 5).&#13;
C.   Place of Birth, Migrant Status&#13;
The majority of the household heads (82%) were not born in&#13;
Lusaka, but were born in rural towns instead. Of those not born in&#13;
Lusaka, 40% were born in the Eastern province, 28% in the Northern&#13;
province, and 12% in the Central province. Of those interviewed,&#13;
63% had spent their childhood in a village in Zambia, 12% grew up in&#13;
Lusaka, and 10% lived in another line of rail town.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 187 -&#13;
Prior to moving to Lusaka, 40% lived in a village in Zambia,&#13;
34% lived in another line of rail town, and 11% lived in another town&#13;
in Zambia.&#13;
The majority of the sites and services housing residents&#13;
are not recent migrants; they have lived in Lusaka for some time.&#13;
48% migrated to the town in 1968 or earlier; an additional 20% moved&#13;
in the period 1969-71, and 20% more migrated from 1972-1974. The median&#13;
migration year is 1969; the mode is 1970. It appears, then, that the&#13;
sites and services residents did not, as some Zambian officials speculate,&#13;
migrate from rural areas to Lusaka as a direct result of the housing&#13;
project. Rather, they migrated, for the most part, in the early years&#13;
after the revolution, presumably to take advantage of job opportunities.&#13;
The claim that the sites and services project encourages rural to urban&#13;
migration is weakened by this evidence.&#13;
D.   First Area of Residence in Lusaka&#13;
Upon arriving in Lusaka, most of the respondents (60%) lived&#13;
with relatives other than their parents, 14% lived with their parents&#13;
or husband, and 11% were rent-paying tenants. Many of these housing&#13;
arrangements (29%) were in low cost rented housing or ina an employers&#13;
compound; 20% were in squatter areas, and 16% were in unaided sites and&#13;
services areas.&#13;
The following table shows the distribution of heads of house-&#13;
holds according to their year of migration and their first place of&#13;
residence in Lusaka:&#13;

None of the migrants resided in their own sites and services&#13;
housing upon arrival in Lusaka; most of them lived with relatives, in&#13;
low-cost rented housing.&#13;
The new migrants were apparently successful in finding employ-&#13;
ment. 99% of all household heads are employed; of this percentage, 9%&#13;
are self-employed.&#13;
The following table gives the percentages of persons in each&#13;
income category who migrated in the various time periods:&#13;

- 189 -&#13;
The table illustrates the fact that most of the wage-earners&#13;
migrated to Lusaka 10 or more years before the survey year (1978), probably&#13;
in search of jobs.&#13;
E.   Previous Area of Residence&#13;
Immediately prior to moving to the survey area, 44% of those&#13;
queried lived in squatter areas, 32% lived in unaided sites and services&#13;
areas, and 12% lived in low-cost rented housing or in an employer-s compound.&#13;
This history of initial residence in areas other than sites and services&#13;
areas is further evidence that the residents of Site 1 did not come to&#13;
Lusaka for the express purpose of moving into sites and services areas;&#13;
they come for jobs and endured inferior housing for a period of years&#13;
prior to moving into the project area.&#13;
F.   Composite&#13;
Based on the mean values of all variables considered so far,&#13;
the typical household head can be described as a male, married to one&#13;
wife only, and 35 years old. His household consists of a nuclear&#13;
family unit -- him, his wife, and several children. The size of his&#13;
household is 5.4 persons, 2 of whom are registered voters.&#13;
He was not born in Lusaka; but in a small village in the&#13;
Eastern province. His education included some formal schooling on&#13;
the secondary level; he probably completed Form 3. He lived in a village&#13;
immediately prior to coming to Lusaka, and migrated to Lusaka in 1969-70.&#13;
Upon arriving, he lived with relatives, usually in low-cost&#13;
rented housing. He inevitably found a job, or became self-employed.&#13;
He then moved to a squatter area, before finally moving into the surveyed&#13;
area.&#13;

II. WHAT THEY DO&#13;
A.   Employment Rates, Place of Employment, Employment History&#13;
The occupational records of the heads of household show extensive&#13;
employmrent backgrounds in varied, but respectable, work areas and fields.&#13;
99% are employed, including 9% who are self-employed. Many of them&#13;
(35%) work in the towns' center; 25% work in a heavy industrial area, and&#13;
11% work in the Ridgeway area, which includes the Civic Center and&#13;
the University Teaching Hospital.&#13;
90% of the HH heads have been working for more than 3 years;&#13;
of this number, 53% have been employed for more than 10 years. The&#13;
mean number of years employed is 14; the median is 10 years.&#13;
B. Previous and Current Occupations&#13;
The heads of household were asked to state the occupations&#13;
they had pursued in 1973, as well as their current jobs. 47% of all&#13;
working persons were employed in a skilled occupation 5 years ago,&#13;
17% were in professional or managerial positions, and 18% were involved&#13;
in semi-skilled work. 4% were unemployed.&#13;
As of 1978, 44%were in skilled occupations, 13% in pnofessional/&#13;
managerial positions, and 22% in semi-skilled positions. Only 1%&#13;
were unemployed.&#13;
As the following cross-tabulation table illustrates, the job&#13;
nobility percentage was 39.3%.  22.9% of the employed showed a downward&#13;
trend in job: status, mostly from skilled to unskilled positions. 16.4%&#13;
of alL workers showed upward job mobility, mostly from an unemployed&#13;
status to an employed status, from unskilled to skilled, and from skilled&#13;
to professional/managerial positions. Most persons (60.7%) stayed&#13;
in the same job category.&#13;

Semi-skilled                 0            2          12.8        2.0         1.3&#13;
Skilled                      0            6.1         4.7       33.1         3.4&#13;

From this data, it can be determined that residence in the sites&#13;
sites and services area has been conducive to job mobility as well&#13;
as to the reductioni of unemployment.  On the whole, however, employment&#13;
has been stable.&#13;
C.    Composite&#13;
The typical head no houisehold has been working for more than 10&#13;
years. Five years ago, he was employed in a skilled occupation; he&#13;
currently works in the center of town, and holds the same position. His&#13;
average monthly wage five years ago was Kwacha 82.84; now, it is ap-&#13;
proximately K. 166.02/month.&#13;
IV. HOW THEY LIVE&#13;
A. Owners vs. Tenants&#13;
The majority of occupants in the survey area own their own&#13;
houses; 97X are owners and 3X are tenants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-192 -&#13;
B. Cost of Houses&#13;
Residents of the project area spent a mean sum of Kwacha&#13;
1012.05 for their houses; the median total cost was K. 782.00. Of&#13;
the total cost, hired labor costs accounted for K. 212.96 (19%); other&#13;
materials bought at the IIPU store were K. 112.79 (9%); other materials&#13;
cost K. 176.89 (12%), and the amount of loan needed from HPU to complete&#13;
the house was K. 509.41 (60%) (All values are mean values).&#13;
The cost of self-help labor, the grand-total, cost of the&#13;
house (total cost + cost of self-help labor), and the percentage cost&#13;
of self-help labor over the grand total cost of the 'nouse were calculated,&#13;
usinlg 3 different assumptions.&#13;
In case 1, it was assumed that the self-help labor was equal&#13;
to that of an unskilled worker, and thus the hourly rate for unskilled&#13;
workers (Kwacha 0.40)* was used in computing the cost. The implicit&#13;
assumption in computing the alternative cost of hiring unskilled labor&#13;
to do work left to "self-help" was that the work could be done by an&#13;
uniskilled worker.&#13;
In case 2, the opportunity cost of self-help labor done by&#13;
the head was measured. It was assumed that self-help labor costs were&#13;
equal to the head's wage; thus the hourly rates of the HH heads were&#13;
used in determining the cost.&#13;
In case 3, it was assumed that the heads of household had the&#13;
help of family members in completing self-help construction; thus, only&#13;
one half of their wage rates were used in computing self-help labor costs.&#13;
* Estimated in previous study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 193 -&#13;
The results are as follows:&#13;
Table 5&#13;
Cost of self-help  Grand total of   Percentage cost of&#13;
Labor (Kwacha)          (Kwacha)       Selp-Help Labor&#13;
Case I (mean)          K. 39.63               1077.77              3.74&#13;
(miedian)              11.20                821.00            1.33&#13;
Case 2 (mean)             120.68              116Z.74              7.62&#13;
(median)               18.00                847.00            2.48&#13;
Case 3 (mean)              60.34              1101.62              4.44&#13;
(median)                9.00                812.81            1.23&#13;
From this table, it can be seen that the savings accrued when&#13;
self-help labor is substitued for hired labor are minimal. The cost&#13;
of self-help labor is only a small percentage of the total cost of the&#13;
house, and it would not have cost much more to hire unskiLled labor to&#13;
do the necessary work. The effectiveness of using self-help labor to&#13;
reduce housing costs must be called into question.&#13;
C . Sources of Money for House Construction&#13;
The following table shows the importance of various sources&#13;
of money available to the project participants: (See Table 6).&#13;
The second largest source of money for house construction is&#13;
participants-salaries. The fact that a heavy burden is placed on the&#13;
heads- monthly incomes might explain the frequency of default on loans&#13;
provided for construction.&#13;

D. Quality of the Housing&#13;
The general quality of the housing is quite high -- 91% of all&#13;
foundations consist of CONCRETE, 99% of foundation walls are constructed&#13;
of CONCRETE BLOCK, 99% of the walls are made of CONCRETE BLOCK or BURNT&#13;
BRICK, 55% have window frames made of STEEL or other materials, 100%&#13;
of the door frames are STEEL, 95% of roofs are made of ASBESTOS and nails,&#13;
and 60% of all floors are of CONCRETE.&#13;
E.   Housing Size&#13;
Most of the houses (53%)have 2 rooms; 20% have 3 or 4 rooms.&#13;
In most homes, the kitchen serves as a multi-purpose room, although in&#13;
47% of the houses, it is used only for cooking.&#13;
Unit densities are as follows:&#13;
Table 7&#13;
Mean                  Median&#13;
Persons per room *               2.8                    2.5&#13;
Persons per square meter         0.164                  0.139&#13;
Persons per house                5.5                    5.1&#13;
* No. of persons in household divided by no. of rooms&#13;
excluding kitchen.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 196 -&#13;
Although the room density figures point towards slight over-&#13;
crowding, 95% of the heads indicated that they planned to make improve-&#13;
ments in their house, including the construction of additional rooms.&#13;
F.   Satisfaction with Allocated Plot&#13;
The majority (90%) was satisfied with the allocated plot,&#13;
and considered the plot allocation system fair. Most of the persons&#13;
indicated that there was sufficient room on their plot for extensions&#13;
to their house; 79% planned to add 2-4 rooms, if they made extensions.&#13;
G.   Source of Water, Before and Currently&#13;
When questioned about the water supply, 98% of the residents&#13;
said they received water from a private tap, and 97% responded that&#13;
they were satisfied with this system. In contrast with this, only&#13;
14% of these people had received water from their own private tap in&#13;
their previous area of residence -- most of them (74%) had obtained&#13;
water from a shared tap, and 12% had relied on wells.&#13;
H.   Sanitary Facilities, Before and After&#13;
The data on sanitary facilities are also impressive. In&#13;
their previous houses, 68% of all persons used shared pit latrines;&#13;
at the time of interview, 91% of all persons had private pit latrines.&#13;
As would be expected, most of those questioned (74%) were satisfied&#13;
with their sanitary facilities in the sites and services housing.&#13;
The direct testimonies of satisfaction with the plot, pos-&#13;
sibilities for extension and improvement, and with water and sanitary&#13;
facilities are in direct contrast with the belief of some Zambian&#13;
officials that the level of satisfaction was low due to the "shoddy&#13;
quality" of services provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197 -&#13;
Through the sites and services project, low income residents&#13;
have acquired good quality housing at reasonable cost. The houses are&#13;
of adequate size, and there is space for extension if the residents&#13;
so desire. The construction materials, water supply, and sanitary&#13;
facilities are superior to those available in squatter housing. Thus,&#13;
the Project has had a substantial role in bettering the standard of&#13;
living of its low income participants.&#13;

            Evaluation of sites and services projects :
            the experience from Lusaka, Zambia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report presents the findings of a
            five-year evaluation of the First Lusaka Upgrading and Sites
            and Services Project. The evaluation formed part of a
            four-country cooperative research project supported jointly
            by the World Bank and the International Development Centre
            of Canada. The evaluation, which was conducted by a
            specially created Evaluation Team within the Project
            Implementing Agency, included both short-term operationally
            oriented studies and more comprehensive socioeconomic impact
            studies. The report contains four main parts and an
            executive summary. Part I discusses the project and the
            political and economic context within which it evolved. The
            remaining parts present the main evaluation findings with
            respect to design and organization, efficiency of project
            implementation and project impact.
