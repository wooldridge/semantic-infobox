&amp;#12;                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1.      Transport costs in Africa are high. High transport and transit costs result in high prices&#13;
to the consumer and a loss of external competitiveness. This has an important impact on the&#13;
development prospects of the continent â&#128;&#147; it reduces economic growth, constrains employment&#13;
generation and makes poverty reduction more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The situation is particularly acute in West Africa, where infrastructure is lacking;&#13;
distances to ports and markets are large, particularly for land-locked countries; and the transport-&#13;
logistics system is hobbled by market distortions. Lowering transport costs becomes all the more&#13;
important as African economies become more open, more externally focused, and increasingly&#13;
engaged in and reliant on international trade as a source of growth and increasing prosperity.&#13;
Efficient, safe and affordable transport services will be key to unleashing Africaâ&#128;&#153;s productive&#13;
potential.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The World Bank is developing a regional Development Policy Operation (DPO), the&#13;
Regional Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness DPO (P129282), as part of a strategy to&#13;
support road transport sector reforms in West Africa. Prior to a more region-wide initiative,&#13;
and given the complexities involved, the Abidjan-Ouagadougou Corridor (AOC) has been&#13;
prioritized as a suitable cross-border initiative for piloting such an approach in the region. The&#13;
objective of the DPO is to reduce trade and transport transaction costs in order to promote&#13;
development of the private sector and improve the business environment in the two countries,&#13;
with the aim of facilitating their integration with the global economy. Given the importance of&#13;
trade for the poor, both to create income opportunities and to reduce the cost of living, this&#13;
operation is fully consistent with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting&#13;
shared prosperity. By lowering currently high transport costs, facilitating trade and promoting&#13;
regional integration, the reforms supported by this program are expected to have broad-based&#13;
welfare gains in both countries, benefiting producers of exported products (including farmers),&#13;
consumers of imported goods and firms using imported inputs, among others.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Significant reform programs always result in winners who benefit positively as well&#13;
as losers who will be impacted negatively. This is inherent in all processes involving economic&#13;
progress and structural transformation. In complex reform programs, there is a need to identify&#13;
stakeholders that may be most vulnerable to the changes brought about by the reform program â&#128;&#147;&#13;
and to better understand the scope and scale of the impact on these groups. This is the objective&#13;
of the present analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of the Main Findings&#13;
&#13;
5.      Macro level impacts are estimated to be positive and large, with substantial poverty&#13;
reduction outcomes. Total benefits across both countries are on the order of US$140 million to&#13;
US$174 million annually. Approximately US$42 million annually in economic benefits will&#13;
accrue to regional consumers, with shippers and producers receiving an additional $34 million in&#13;
direct benefits annually. The two governments are expected to save up to US$100 million in&#13;
road maintenance expenses per year. Burkina Faso, being landlocked, benefits the most as it&#13;
enjoys greater trade and producer and consumer price savings from improved transit trade.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 iv&#13;
&amp;#12;6.     There will be direct positive impacts on most transport sector participants on&#13;
account of higher expected incomes. Net transport revenue after costs for transit truck&#13;
operators is estimated to increase by about US$15 to $60 million, where both countries are net&#13;
beneficiaries of the reforms. This net effect includes the combined effects of increased&#13;
productivity, lower unit operating costs and increased revenue from increased demand and&#13;
cabotage operations. Estimated cost savings in the neighborhood of 20 percent are envisaged,&#13;
which when combined with increased demand and increased utilization rates (due to the&#13;
expected decline in the number of trucks) should lead to significantly increased profits and&#13;
incomes for truckers and their families. Therefore, the reforms should have a significant impact&#13;
on lowering poverty levels among the significant number of operators remaining in the industry.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Average transport prices should also fall. Shippers should benefit from increased&#13;
efficiency in the transport industry as reflected in price decreases of approximately 20 percent.&#13;
These price savings will also be accompanied by more intangible and more difficult to quantify&#13;
benefits such as improved reliability and predictability, faster delivery periods, reduced damage&#13;
to goods, etc. These additional benefits could be at least as significant to shippers and consumers&#13;
of transport services as the price reductions.&#13;
&#13;
8.     However, some industry participants will be negatively impacted by the reforms as&#13;
the number of trucks in the total transit trucking fleets is expected to decline with reforms by 800&#13;
to 1,000 vehicles, or some 11 to 14 percent of the 7,100 transit vehicle fleet. This will lead to a&#13;
decrease in direct trucking industry employment of around 2,500 jobs,1 with the impact on land-&#13;
locked Burkina Faso being more severe than in coastal CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire.&#13;
&#13;
9.     Those who are most vulnerable to the negative impacts emanating from the reforms&#13;
will be mostly informal truckers -- often older and illiterate, who are unable to find&#13;
employment elsewhere in a more professional and modernized transport industry. As well, some&#13;
coxeurs and stevedores, who benefit from the heretofore informal structure of the trucking&#13;
business, will be negatively impacted.&#13;
&#13;
10.    Nonetheless, benefits from reforms are orders of magnitude higher than the&#13;
potential negative impacts on specific actors in the industry:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·   The trade effects are an order of magnitude larger than the trucking employment&#13;
        effects. Trade increases have a variety of employment impacts. For imports of consumer&#13;
        goods there are retail jobs, delivery and distribution jobs, import service jobs and their&#13;
        multipliers. For intermediate goods and exports there are distribution and logistics jobs,&#13;
        processing and related services with their multipliers. Even by these low estimates trade&#13;
        impacts on employment more than compensate for losses in trucking-related industries.&#13;
        The net employment effects of the proposed reforms are expected to be between 60,000&#13;
        and 220,000 new jobs in Burkina Faso, which is the country most negatively affected by&#13;
        the direct trucking employment losses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  In the long run, a loss in employment will be more than compensated for by much larger job increases in other&#13;
sectors arising from increased trade.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      v&#13;
&amp;#12;   ï&#130;·   The impacts of road transport reform go far beyond the direct impact on truckers,&#13;
       shippers and governments. As noted, total annual benefits across both countries are on&#13;
       the order of US$140 million to US$174 million when net benefits to the trucking and&#13;
       government sectors are included.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   The potential increases in trade to landlocked Burkina Faso would amount to US$380&#13;
       million annually. This is related primarily to responses to price changes, which result in&#13;
       increased demand for imports and an increase in supply of exports. This is a conservative&#13;
       estimate since it does not take into account the general improvement in logistics service,&#13;
       which will result from these reforms. The improved logistics systems may be an equally&#13;
       effective catalyst for increased trade as the lower costs. Gains from more efficient and&#13;
       cost-effective road transport could be expected in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire as well.&#13;
&#13;
11.    Therefore, the policy question is not whether to proceed with the reforms, but how&#13;
to mitigate the potential negative impacts. After careful analysis, including substantial&#13;
discussion with a broad cross-section of industry participants, the PSIA proposes the following&#13;
potential mitigation measures for negatively affected stakeholder groups:&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Measures to facilitate fleet renewal: Measures to facilitate access to finance in order to&#13;
       facilitate fleet renewal, including the purchase or upgrading of new trucks, trailers and&#13;
       equipment, will have to be appropriately structured so as to facilitate access from across&#13;
       the spectrum of truckers and companies, from large to small and from formal to informal.&#13;
       This will have to include a careful determination of collateral requirements, interest&#13;
       charges, amortization periods, down payment requirements, etc.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Phasing and sequencing of reforms: First, given that a number of those unable to&#13;
       transition to a more modern and professional environment tend to be older operators, it&#13;
       may be useful to phase in some requirements or provide â&#128;&#156;grandfatherâ&#128;? clauses to permit a&#13;
       logical phasing-out period and to permit natural attrition to take its course. Second, some&#13;
       adjustment will be required even among those willing and able to modernize.&#13;
       Appropriate timing and sequencing of reforms could facilitate and allow for a more&#13;
       gradual, less disruptive and more inclusive adjustment period.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Scrappage schemes: As truck numbers are expected to fall, at least initially,&#13;
       appropriately designed mechanisms that provide incentives to scrap old trucks could be&#13;
       useful in modernizing the road transport sector and also in providing resources for those&#13;
       wanting to transition to other activities. Participation in scrappage schemes could also&#13;
       help identify those truckers leaving the sector and thus facilitate their access to and&#13;
       participation in other programs, such as re-training programs, that could further&#13;
       accommodate their transition.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Re-group into groupement dâ&#128;&#153;intÃ©rÃªts Ã©conomiques (GIE): Small and artisanal operators&#13;
       could organize themselves into cooperatives to attain economies of scale -- potentially&#13;
       enabling them to share costs and assets as a means to attain a greater degree of&#13;
       professionalization. Several small operators expressed an interest in this avenue and&#13;
       some were planning such efforts.&#13;
&#13;
                                               vi&#13;
&amp;#12;ï&#130;·   Partnerships with large operators: Small, informal, and artisanal operators could&#13;
    potentially partner with larger, formal operators, including through the sale of their&#13;
    trucks. Supporting measures may be necessary to organize and bring them together with&#13;
    potentially interested big operators, but this was noted as a possibility.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Transition to other activities: If unable to professionalize, small/informal operators can&#13;
    transition to other activities based on their existing skill levels or asset endowment. For&#13;
    example, some have indicated the possibility of transitioning to passenger transport,&#13;
    which is less cumbersome in terms of investment requirements relative to the trucking&#13;
    business. Others could transition to trade in merchandise related to the trucking business,&#13;
    such as sale of truck tires, vehicle oil and lubricants, or logistics related activities.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Supporting policy measures: As part of the reform process, operators intending to&#13;
    transition to other activities could benefit from supporting policy measures such as access&#13;
    to finance as well as training opportunities to transition to other activities. Training&#13;
    opportunities were noted as being very important, in particular for the small operators&#13;
    considering the fact that almost all drivers are illiterate.&#13;

&amp;#12;   POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (PSIA) OF ROAD&#13;
   TRANSPORT REFORMS ALONG THE ABIDJAN-OUAGADOUGOU&#13;
                        CORRIDOR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.1     The World Bank is developing a regional Development Policy Operation (DPO), the&#13;
Regional Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness DPO (P129282), as part of a strategy to&#13;
support road transport sector reforms in West Africa. Prior to a more region-wide initiative,&#13;
and given the complexities involved, the Abidjan-Ouagadougou Corridor (AOC) has been&#13;
prioritized as a suitable cross-border initiative for piloting such an approach in the region.&#13;
&#13;
1.2     Two supporting studies are being undertaken, including a political economy&#13;
analysis and this poverty and social impact assessment (PSIA), in order to better inform&#13;
operational design and optimise the achievement of results. These background studies in support&#13;
of the operation should improve knowledge of the corridor specific and broader transport sector&#13;
reform challenges/opportunities, the prospects for success, and the implications of the planned&#13;
reforms.&#13;
&#13;
1.3    The PSIA aims to assess the poverty and social impact of the proposed reforms in&#13;
the participating countries. Impact will vary between the in-transit country (CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire) and&#13;
the land-locked country (Burkina Faso), and between various social/demographic groups within&#13;
the countries. It is expected that poverty and social impacts will arise at the macro, sectoral and&#13;
micro levels and the analysis will attempt to identify impacts arising at these various levels.&#13;
&#13;
1.4      Macro, sectoral and micro level impacts will all be assessed. Macro level impacts will&#13;
largely arise from increased economic efficiency related to reduced transport costs, expanding&#13;
trade opportunities, increased economic competitiveness, and the resultant increased&#13;
employment, wages and incomes associated with improving economic conditions and increased&#13;
competitiveness. At the sectoral level, the supported reforms will lead to cost and price changes&#13;
in the sector with related effects on incomes, institutional changes, shifts in numbers employed in&#13;
various job categories across the sector, and in the creation of new employment opportunities&#13;
and the potential disappearance of some existing jobs. As such, there will be a distributional&#13;
impact on employment and incomes across the sector. At the micro level, particular attention&#13;
will be given to the impact on small independent truckers and those employed as intermediaries&#13;
in institutions that may no longer exist or will be subject to significant downsizing post-reform.&#13;
Impacts on their families and dependents, and the potential options open to these individuals in&#13;
light of the proposed reforms will be explored.&#13;
&#13;
1.5     The exercise also identifies potential mitigating or compensatory measures that could&#13;
be instituted. Similarly, the analysis will identify, where possible, potential measures and&#13;
policies that could be undertaken by Governments to mitigate the impact, to allow those affected&#13;
by the reforms to benefit to a greater degree from the reforms â&#128;&#147; or alternatively, to transition into&#13;
other activities, trucking and trade-related or otherwise.&#13;

&amp;#12;1.6      The report is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a background discussion of&#13;
issues and challenges within the road transport sector in the region; briefly reviews the&#13;
macroeconomic and poverty situation in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso; and then more&#13;
specifically, focuses on road transport costs and the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor. Section 3&#13;
follows with a discussion of the organization of the industry in order to better understand the&#13;
various players and institutions involved in road transport along the corridor. This is important&#13;
to facilitate an appreciation of the various players, their roles and thus their potential exposure to&#13;
significant sector reform. Section 4 then summarizes the envisaged reform program and&#13;
introduces the various specific reform proposals. The macroeconomic impact of road transport&#13;
reforms are then discussed in Section 5 and the broad benefits of the proposed reform program&#13;
are summarized. Section 6 then recognizes that despite the significant macro and economy-wide&#13;
benefits, certain groups will be negatively impacted by the planned reforms and the impact on&#13;
these groups is identified. Finally, Section 7 concludes and summarizes the main findings.&#13;

&#13;
A. PROBLEM DEFINITION&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;&#156;One of the few things that African policy makers, development partners, civil society, and policy&#13;
 researchers agree on is that Africa has a serious infrastructure deficit. . . . Perhaps the most compelling&#13;
 problem is that of road infrastructure. There are fewer kilometers of roads in Africa today than there were&#13;
 30 years ago. Some 70 percent of Africaâ&#128;&#153;s rural population lives more than 2 km from an all -season road.&#13;
 And the cost of transporting goods in Africa is the highest in the world. Not only have high transport costs&#13;
 raised the cost of doing business, impeding private investment, but they serve as an additional barrier to&#13;
 African countriesâ&#128;&#153; benefiting from the rapid growth in world trade. Especially for Africaâ&#128;&#153;s many&#13;
 landlocked countries, high transport costs mean that, even if they liberalize their trade regimes, they will&#13;
 remain effectively landlocked.â&#128;?&#13;
                                                                          Teravaninthorn and Raballand, 2009&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;&#156;Sahelian landlocked countries â&#128;&#147; Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger â&#128;&#147; suffer from high costs of road haulage&#13;
 due to long distances to ports, poor roads, un-roadworthy trucks, poor logistics and corruption. High costs&#13;
 limit the competitiveness of their transit trade through West Africaâ&#128;&#153;s ports. The resulting low volumes of&#13;
 trade limit their prospects for economic development and thus limit growth in employment and incomes.â&#128;?&#13;

&#13;
 â&#128;&#156;The road transport sector in West Africa has been described as:&#13;
   ï&#130;· Higher priced, less efficient, and less reliable than transport in other regions of Africa and the world;&#13;
   ï&#130;· Dominated by older vehicles and small informal operators; and&#13;
   ï&#130;· Saddled with policies and regulations that provide no incentives to become more efficient.â&#128;?&#13;
                                                                              Nathan Associates/USAID, 2012&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;&#156;One of the few things that African policy makers, development partners, civil society, and policy&#13;
 researchers agree on is that Africa has a serious infrastructure deficit. . . . Perhaps the most compelling&#13;
 problem is that of road infrastructure. There are fewer kilometers of roads in Africa today than there were&#13;
 30 years ago. Some 70 percent of Africaâ&#128;&#153;s rural population lives more than 2 km from an all -season road.&#13;
 And the cost of transporting goods in Africa is the highest in the world. Not only have high transport costs&#13;
 raised the cost of doing business, impeding private investment, but they serve as an additional barrier to&#13;
 African countriesâ&#128;&#153; benefiting from the rapid growth in world trade. Especially for Africaâ&#128;&#153;s many&#13;
 landlocked countries, high transport costs mean that, even if they liberalize their trade regimes, they will&#13;
 remain effectively landlocked.â&#128;?&#13;
                                                      2&#13;
&amp;#12;2.1     Transport costs in Africa are high. High transport and transit costs result in high prices&#13;
to the consumer and a loss of external competitiveness. This has an important impact on the&#13;
development prospects of the continent â&#128;&#147; it reduces economic growth, constrains employment&#13;
generation and makes poverty reduction more difficult. Lowering transport costs becomes all the&#13;
more important as African economies become more open, more externally focused, and&#13;
increasingly engaged in and reliant on international trade as a source of growth and increasing&#13;
prosperity. Efficient, safe and affordable transport services will be key to unleashing Africaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
productive potential.&#13;
&#13;
2.2     The situation is particularly acute in West Africa, where infrastructure is lacking and&#13;
distances to ports and markets are large, particularly for land-locked countries. The state of the&#13;
regionâ&#128;&#153;s physical transport infrastructure is but one part of the story, and increased public and&#13;
private investment is unquestionably needed. However, if we have learned anything in&#13;
development economics over the past couple of decades it is that â&#128;&#156;institutions matter.â&#128;?&#13;
Governance arrangements in the West African road transport sector are antiquated, highly&#13;
inefficient and distortionary. These policy, regulatory and institutional failures are widely&#13;
recognized.&#13;
&#13;
2.3     Significant analysis has been undertaken on the high costs imposed on the&#13;
economies of the region by the structural distortions and constraints imposed by inefficient&#13;
regional trucking conventions (such as the tour de role system, quotas for national carriers,&#13;
non-market based freight allocation, over-weight loads, oligopolistic unions/structures,&#13;
inefficient institutions, a multitude of rent seeking opportunities, etc.) A considerable body of&#13;
evidence indicates that liberalization and professionalization of the trucking market would result&#13;
in important economic efficiencies, significantly lower costs, including costs to both import and&#13;
export, and improve economic efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
2.4     The sub-region is characterized by strong market regulation (formal and informal),&#13;
primarily regulated by freight forwarders and shippers. There is also a multitude of existing&#13;
regional and bilateral arrangements in the sector that pose constraints and disincentives to the&#13;
efficient and effective provision of road transport services. This existing institutional and policy&#13;
environment has resulted in the provision of low quality transport services, small trucking&#13;
companies (indeed largely single truck owner-operator entities), and old, obsolete and unsafe&#13;
trucking fleets.&#13;
&#13;
2.5      It is not that a trucking fleet consisting of small, old, independently operated trucks&#13;
in and of its self contributes to higher costs and reduced efficiency. Indeed, there are&#13;
numerous examples of such fleets elsewhere in the world that are fully capable of providing&#13;
competitive and low cost transport services. Modernization of the fleet is not the end goal.&#13;
Rather it is largely the regional regulatory and policy environment that results in the existing&#13;
fleet, old or otherwise, and sector organization, not meeting the necessary requirements for the&#13;
provision of effective transit services, with trucks being unreliable and poorly-maintained, more&#13;
often than not over-loaded, unable to meet safety standards, under-utilized, high cost, inefficient,&#13;
etc. In sum, the existing policy environment provides little incentive for the fleet to provide&#13;
effective and competitive transport services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 3&#13;
&amp;#12;2.6     Available research finds that high transport costs in West Africa are the result of a&#13;
combination of dilapidated infrastructure and a number of market distortions.&#13;
Both the existing regulatory frameworks and shortcomings in their implementation limit&#13;
effective competition within the transport industry, increasing costs and leading to a gap between&#13;
prices and costs, as well as to an environment not conducive to investment. The lack of criteria&#13;
for access to the transport profession and transparent mechanisms to match supply and demand&#13;
for transport services has given rise to the emergence of a few dominant operators that allocate&#13;
freight to truckers with large rents, but at barely break-even rates to the operators carrying the&#13;
freight. The sector is divided between a large number of small informal and inefficient&#13;
transporters and a small number of larger and relatively efficient companies. Low profitability&#13;
creates strong incentives to resort to short-term rent-seeking behaviors, including overloading of&#13;
trucks beyond the legal axle load limit. Overloading adversely affects the durability and safety&#13;
of operations, damages the road network, and discourages containerization. In addition to the&#13;
market structure, a major problem affecting the profitability of the trucking industry and&#13;
increasing trade costs is the slow rotation time on the corridor, i.e. the small number of round&#13;
trips from Abidjan to Ouagadougou by the average truck, which also results from delays at the&#13;
port and at the border and the difficulty to find backhaul cargo. These conditions make it&#13;
difficult for the majority of transporters to finance new trucks.&#13;
&#13;
2.7    Reducing transport prices is not only important to facilitate the much-needed&#13;
structural transformation, but also has direct poverty-reducing impacts by promoting&#13;
better regional integration. Notably, lower transport prices and more efficient logistics&#13;
services for the movement of food staples will enhance food security by preventing the loss of&#13;
crops during transport, while helping to strengthen the competitiveness of traditional exports&#13;
such as cattle from landlocked countries in the Sahel. Transit systems are vital for landlocked&#13;
countries and have been recognized as such in the 10-year Vienna Program of Action, which was&#13;
adopted in November 2014 by the United Nations General Assembly and is supported by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
2.8     Therefore, a regional approach to reform is necessary. It is apparent that both&#13;
regional and simultaneous national level reforms are necessary to permit and facilitate efficient,&#13;
safe and affordable road transport in the region. Just as national reforms on their own, in areas&#13;
such as truck registration, mandatory technical standards and inspections, driver training (both&#13;
for initial driving licenses and for acquiring professional and specialized competencies),&#13;
insurance requirements, access to the profession and to the market, regulations on perishable&#13;
food stuffs and dangerous goods, etc., will accomplish little in the absence of a fundamental and&#13;
meaningful reform of the regional governance and regulatory framework, so will reform of&#13;
regional arrangements, such as freight sharing quotas, joint border procedures, containerization&#13;
measures, etc., accomplish little unless appropriate, coherent and compatible national&#13;
frameworks are in place. Reform at both levels is clearly required.&#13;
&#13;
2.9     However, it must be recognized that meaningful reforms will entail significant&#13;
adjustment and that such adjustment will fall more heavily on certain countries (e.g. landlocked&#13;
countries) and on certain affected groups within countries (e.g. small trucking companies and&#13;
single truck operators). The provision of adequate financial resources to participating countries,&#13;
in addition to necessary analytic, TA and capacity building efforts, will be important in order to&#13;
&#13;
                                                4&#13;
&amp;#12;facilitate the necessary adjustment. This PSIA is intended to assist in effectively identifying&#13;
vulnerable groups, assessing the impact of reforms on affected populations, and potentially&#13;
identifying accompanying measures and programs to address those negatively affected.&#13;
&#13;
B. MACROECONOMIC&#13;
&#13;
2.10 In recent years, the economic performance of both CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso&#13;
has been characterized by relatively strong growth and macroeconomic stability. Following&#13;
the end of the crisis in 2011, CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire has quickly rebounded. Investor confidence has&#13;
benefited from large-scale debt relief following the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)&#13;
completion point and from satisfactory progress under an IMF program and Bank DPOs. Sharp&#13;
improvements in its Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and its Cost of Doing&#13;
Business ranking are further testimony to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s rapid progress. 2 Burkina Faso has seen&#13;
equally rapid growth in recent years, on account of: a booming mining industry; improved&#13;
performance of the cotton industry, which employs the majority of the labor force; and&#13;
expansion of the services industry (e.g., banking, insurance, transport). In addition to strong&#13;
performance under IMF programs and Bank DPOs, Burkinaâ&#128;&#153;s progress in economic policy&#13;
reform is also demonstrated by one of the highest CPIA ratings in West Africa (3.8), driven by&#13;
improvements in public financial management (PFM) and the business environment, leading to&#13;
substantial increases in its Doing Business rating.&#13;
&#13;
2.11 Notwithstanding these improvements, poverty reduction has remained elusive in&#13;
both countries. Partly due to the impact of CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoireâ&#128;&#153;s political crises since the late 1990s,&#13;
the countryâ&#128;&#153;s poverty rate rose from a mere 18 percent in 1985 to over 50 percent in 2008.&#13;
Preliminary evidence suggests that the war exacerbated poverty rates even further, and that&#13;
progress since the end of the crisis has been limited (in 2013, the incidence of poverty is&#13;
estimated to have fallen back to 2008 levels). Over the past decade, in addition to an increase in&#13;
the incidence, depth and severity of poverty, the bottom 40 percent of the population lost more in&#13;
terms of mean consumption per capita than the total population. Poverty is overwhelmingly&#13;
concentrated in rural areas and it has been increasing in the North and the West, due in part to a&#13;
geographical concentration of social and infrastructure expenditure in Abidjan.3 This highlights&#13;
the importance of better connecting rural areas to more economically dynamic centers and to&#13;
markets, which requires both adequate transport infrastructure and efficient transport and&#13;
logistics services.&#13;
&#13;
2.12 For Burkina Faso, national statistics measured a headcount poverty rate of 46.7&#13;
percent in 2009, down marginally from 51.0 percent in 2003. Preliminary results suggested&#13;
that it has continued to decline since then, to 40.1 percent in 2014. A rapidly growing population&#13;
and substantial income inequality have limited the anti-poverty effects of Burkinaâ&#128;&#153;s recent&#13;
growth performance, even if improvements have been observed in the area of human&#13;
development. Poverty incidence remains heavily concentrated in rural areas, where average&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
  CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoireâ&#128;&#153;s CPIA score improved from 2.7 in 2011 to 3.2 in 2014. Its ranking on the Cost of Doing Business&#13;
index improved from 177th in 2011 to 147th in 2015, and CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire was among the Top 10 reforming countries in&#13;
both the 2014 and 2015 editions of Doing Business.&#13;
3&#13;
  Information on poverty is taken from the recently completed Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) for CÃ´te&#13;
dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       5&#13;
&amp;#12;poverty rates are more than double those of urban centers, and the decrease of poverty in recent&#13;
years has been faster in urban areas. In order to increase the impact of accelerated growth on&#13;
poverty reduction, reforms are needed in key areas, including the reduction of transportation and&#13;
trade costs. In parallel, both countries have recorded persistently high underemployment, in&#13;
particular among youth and women.&#13;
&#13;
2.13 The failure of Burkina Faso and CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire to increase productivity in&#13;
agriculture and industrialize is related, in part, to shortcomings in their business&#13;
environments.4 Most importantly, case studies of companies in the two countries have&#13;
demonstrated that high transport costs are one of the key binding constraints to growthâ&#128;&#148;in&#13;
addition to the cost of energy and access to finance. The available evidence suggests that the&#13;
Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor is expensive, even by African standards. Reducing transport&#13;
costs would have large economic impacts beyond the corridor as is explored further in Section 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.14 Trade transaction costs are critical for the competitiveness of any economy, and&#13;
CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso stand out even among other high -cost countries by their&#13;
logistics costs. With export competitiveness being one of the most important factors explaining&#13;
higher growth in emerging markets, high transport costs act as key factors adversely affecting the&#13;
development of the private sector, and hence incomes and growth.&#13;
&#13;
2.15 A comparative analysis of the cost of transit freight for a container from the ports of&#13;
Abidjan, LomÃ© and Tema to Burkina Faso indicates that the Abidjan corridor is the most&#13;
costly. In fact, data shows that high transport prices and fees charged by port and transport&#13;
operators are among the main factors reducing the competitiveness of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou&#13;
corridor (Figure 2.1).&#13;

  Despite improvements in the business environment, both CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso rank near the bottom of&#13;
this index.&#13;
&#13;
                                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;2.16 A breakdown of transport costs shows that cargo handling and inland transport&#13;
seem to be the main drivers of trade costs in Burkina Faso and CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire. According to&#13;
the most recent Doing Business data, handling and inland transportation costs per 20-feet&#13;
container add up to US$2,305 and 4,330 for exports and imports respectively in Burkina Faso,&#13;
and to US$1,390 and 1,960 in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire.5 This is well above the corresponding costs in other&#13;
West African countries except Mali. It is also significantly higher than costs in Mauritius and&#13;
Singapore, respectively the best African and global performers (Figure 2.2). While high transport&#13;
costs would be expected for landlocked countries given the distance to the port, cargo handling&#13;
and transportation represent a higher proportion of total costs between Ouagadougou and the port&#13;
of Abidjan (81% in the case of exports) than between Bamako and the port of Dakar (68%).&#13;
Likewise, cargo handling and transportation are significantly more expensive in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire&#13;
than in other coastal countries.&#13;

  Doing Business measures the time and cost associated with exporting and importing a standardized cargo of goods,&#13;
based on information provided by local freight forwarders, shipping lines, customs brokers, port officials and banks.&#13;
For exporting goods, procedures range from packing the goods into the container at the warehouse to their departure&#13;
from the port of exit. For importing goods, procedures range from the vesselâ&#128;&#153;s arrival at the port of entry to the&#13;
cargoâ&#128;&#153;s delivery at the warehouse in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s largest business city. For landlocked economies, procedures and&#13;
costs at the inland border post are included, since the port is located in the transit economy. Only official costs are&#13;
recorded, including costs for documents, administrative fees for customs clearance and inspections, customs broker&#13;
fees, port-related charges and inland transport costs (sea transport and customs tariffs are not counted). For more&#13;

&amp;#12;2.17 The priority areas of intervention for the reduction of trading costs are by&#13;
decreasing order of magnitude: the inland transport prices, mainly road transport,&#13;
followed by the terminal costs, mostly at the maritime gateway, and less importantly at&#13;
inland destination/origin. An analysis conducted in 2012 on the West Africa corridors assessed&#13;
the total logistics costs for importing goods, taking into account not only the financial cost of the&#13;
logistics services from the maritime gateway to the final destination, but also the economic&#13;
impact of delivery time and the uncertainties of that time (Nathan 2013). The results on the&#13;
Abidjan-Ouagadougou and Abidjan Bamako corridors, for a 40â&#128;&#153; container, are illustrated in&#13;
Figure 2.3. The large uncertainties in the delivery time, as well as the excessive time taken by&#13;
some portions of the transfer of the goods along the corridors, are largely a consequence of the&#13;
inefficiencies along the corridors. Improving the documentation process and the physical&#13;
movement of the goods will have a strong positive impact on the costs associated with delays&#13;
and uncertainties borne by the shippers, but also on the direct cost of the logistics services, as&#13;
delays en route impact the efficiency of the inland transport operations.&#13;

   ï&#130;·   Inland Transport Prices and Costs&#13;
&#13;
2.18 How can high inland transport costs be explained? The trucking industry, at first&#13;
sight, is a highly competitive industry and meets the basic requirement for perfect competition:&#13;
many suppliers with none of them in an ostensibly dominant position, similar services (at least&#13;
for the dry freight segment of the market), open information on prices, and no barriers to entry&#13;
and exit for operators. While these characteristics would suggest that the industry is indeed&#13;
competitive, prices should equal marginal costs. Teravaninthorn &amp; Raballand (2009) find that the&#13;
transport of freight between Sahelian countries and their ports, and thus the world market, is at&#13;
prices that significantly exceed underlying costs, suggesting large profits. They also find that&#13;
these high profits can be attributed to rent-seeking road-transport cartels benefiting from&#13;
oligopolies that exist as a result of existing governance and institutional structures. They argue&#13;
&#13;
                                                           8&#13;
&amp;#12;that, unless governments take steps to remove the structural distortions in the trucking market,&#13;
there is little point in investing in infrastructure improvements to reduce road-transport costs as&#13;
the cartels will capture the benefits from lowered costs: prices will remain the same and cartel&#13;
members will benefit from higher profits. This represents a fundamental constraint to the&#13;
economic development of the region and for three of the poorest countries in the world in&#13;
particular â&#128;&#147; landlocked Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali.&#13;
&#13;
2.19 Among the components of the trucking cost structure, schematically illustrated in&#13;
Figure 2.4, mark-ups are to a large extent related to the market structure which is&#13;
substantially the result of the prevailing regulatory framework. Essentially, the lack of&#13;
criteria for access to the profession and transparent mechanisms has given rise to the emergence&#13;
of a few dominant operators that allocate freight to truckers at a large profit to themselves, but at&#13;
barely break-even rates to the operators physically carrying the freight. This market structure has&#13;
triggered the emergence of widely different business models depending on how they benefit&#13;
from or cope with an imperfect system. Examples of different business models include: small&#13;
informal operators that transport for their own account; those delivering goods within Abidjan;&#13;
relatively efficient trucking companies with direct contracts with carrying and forwarding agents;&#13;
and individual trucking companies that depend on several intermediaries.&#13;

         costs associated with truck idle time, which in turn is itself linked to truck operating&#13;
         conditions;&#13;

    -   The trucking gross margin is the difference between the price paid to the trucking&#13;
        operator and its costs;&#13;
    -   The cost of intermediaries corresponds to the difference between the price paid by the&#13;
        shipperâ&#128;&#148;commonly used as a point of reference when price comparisons are madeâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
        the actual price paid to the trucking operator that performs the trucking service. That&#13;
        difference corresponds to the margin captured by intermediaries.&#13;
&#13;
2.20 In addition to the multiplicity of business models, a specificity of the trucking&#13;
industry in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire is that stevedoring companies in the port have granted themselves&#13;
a monopoly for road deliveries in the Abidjan metropolitan area. As a consequence of that&#13;
monopoly, the largest trucking companies in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire are the port cargo handling&#13;
companies, for which transport is an ancillary activity. This arrangement also leads to very high&#13;
costs of transport within Abidjan.&#13;
&#13;
2.21 Cut-throat rates offered to small individual truckers by shippers that dominate the&#13;
market force these truckers to resort to short-term survivalist models of behavior aimed at&#13;
achieving higher profitability. These strategies include overloading the truck beyond the axle&#13;
load limit stipulated by law. Overloading trucks adversely affects the durability of trucks and&#13;
damages the road network. Yet, in view of the short-term advantage, these truckers prefer to&#13;
accept a load under these conditions rather than keeping the truck idle. In addition, overloading&#13;
of trucks discourages containerization, as containers tend to occupy more space than the stripped&#13;
cargo and two or more containers can be unpacked and loaded onto a single truck.6 Yet,&#13;
containerization tends to reduce transshipment costs and creates economies of scale, including as&#13;
a result of lower insurance rates (as containers are less subject to theft) and increased inventory&#13;
turnover and cash flow. Overloading and lack of containerization may help profitability in the&#13;
short term, but further depresses it in the long term. It also increases costs in the longer term, as&#13;
truck maintenance costs increase as a result of over-loading.&#13;
&#13;
2.22 In addition to the market structure, a major problem affecting the profitability of&#13;
the trucking industry is the slow rotation time. Rotation time refers to the relatively small&#13;
number of roundtrips from Abidjan to Ouagadougou undertaken by the average truck. This is&#13;
partly a function of the long time it takes to transport cargo from the port to its destination (30 to&#13;
40 days) and the excess supply of trucks available for accepting shipments. The main factors&#13;
leading to slow rotation are:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Long delays at the port in Abidjan: This is due to delays in unloading ships, the&#13;
        transfer of cargo to trucks, and clearance procedures at the port. Available statistics point&#13;
        to an average of 13 days for containers to leave the port including related clearance&#13;
        procedures (notably, exclusivity rights of certain clearing agents; the allocation of two-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
 In 2011, one third of the port traffic was containerized in the port of Abidjan. This compares with a proportion of&#13;
50 percent for Cotonou. Furthermore, for transit trade, there is only a very small degree of containerization on the&#13;
Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor.&#13;

&amp;#12;         thirds of cargo to land-locked country truckers and one-third to coastal country truckers;&#13;
         and lengthy and cumbersome customs processes).&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    The poor state of the road infrastructure: Available data point to conditions in the&#13;
         Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor being substantially inferior to those in other competitor&#13;
         corridors (Figure 2.5).&#13;

&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Roadblocks: Roadblocks are created by law enforcement (police and other security&#13;
         forces), formally to enforce compliance with applicable rules for truckers and informally&#13;
         to collect rents. With overloading of trucks beyond the axle load limit a common&#13;
         occurrence, police argue for the need to enforce applicable rules through frequent&#13;
         roadblocks. However, available literature shows that roadblocks effectively serve as a&#13;
         means to extract bribes from truckers. Roadblocks create additional transport delays and&#13;
         increase rotation time.&#13;
&#13;
2.23 Extremely slow rotation times and their pernicious effect on the profitability of the&#13;
trucking industry have been investigated in a number of studies looking at both transit&#13;
trade as well as domestic transport.7 Data from the Burkinabe Shippersâ&#128;&#153; Council (CBC) show&#13;
that truck utilization rates on regional corridors are extremely low. Out of the 15,956 trucks&#13;
having used the corridors between Burkina Faso and its neighbors in 2012, almost half did only&#13;
one trip, 80% did six trips or less and 95% did twelve trips or less (Figure 2.6). The trucks which&#13;
did twelve trips or less represented 75% of all the trips recorded on the corridor. Conversely,&#13;
only 196 trucks (1.2% of the total) were recorded as doing at least twenty trips per year. These&#13;
results confirm that transporting goods between countries is only an occasional activity for a vast&#13;
majority of truckers, who may also be active in domestic transport or have sources of revenue&#13;
other than transport. As explained in Box 2.1, the number of rotations per year is an important&#13;
factor determining transport services providersâ&#128;&#153; capacity to finance trucks.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Beyond transport time from Abidjan to Ouagadougou, assessing truck utilization rates with the number of roundtrips&#13;
per year is essential to understand trucking companiesâ&#128;&#153; capacity to acquire better trucks.&#13;
&#13;
Following Hartmann (2013), one can estimate the revenue available for truck financing as a function of the number&#13;
of roundtrips per year. Vehicle operating (variable) costs, such as driver, fuel and tires, are estimated to represent&#13;
55% of the price charged to transport a 40â&#128;&#153; container between Abidjan and Ouagadougou (with an empty backhaul&#13;
to return the container to the port). The balance is considered the amount available to: (i) cover company overhead&#13;
(e.g. licenses, staff and offices), which are higher for large/formal operators than for small/informal ones; and (ii)&#13;
finance the acquisition of trucks. A new truck, costing for instance FCFA 90 million, financed at 50% under a bank&#13;
loan over 5 years and amortized over 7 years, requires around FCFA 15 million per year. As shown in Figure 2.7, it&#13;
is only beyond twenty roundtrips per year that operations start to be compatible with the acquisition of new trucks.&#13;
Even a second-hand truck, frequently costing FCFA 18 million for a 10-year old truck, requires FCFA 6 million per&#13;
year to finance over three years, which is only possible with at least eight roundtrips per year. These thresholds can&#13;
be considered lower-bound estimates, as the calculations do not include fixed costs.&#13;

2.24 The evidence above suggests that, for most transporters, revenue from transport on&#13;
the corridors only is far from sufficient to allow for the financing of better quality trucks.&#13;
Operating new trucks is only affordable for transport companies having regular contracts with&#13;
large shippers or clearing and forwarding firms, and with transport containers between the port&#13;
terminal and the dry port. Others are likely to be excluded from that segment and to focus on&#13;

&amp;#12;2.25 The total fleet for large trucks (19 tons and over) in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire represents over&#13;
17,000 trucks.8 Vehicles registered under commercial transport represent 69%, but several&#13;
companies registered under private (or own-account) transport are actually public transport&#13;
companies. Individual operators dominate the commercial transport sector, with 62% of the fleet,&#13;
while companies dominate the own-account transport sector, with 86% of the fleet (Figure 2.8).&#13;

&#13;
2.26 Overall, a market structure dominated by a few operators, non-transparent&#13;
allocation of freight, slow rotation times and inefficient customs clearance procedures has&#13;
given rise to a suboptimal low-productivity equilibrium in transport characterized by a&#13;
large gap between prices and costs and little incentive for poorly compensated truckers to&#13;
invest, which explains the co-existence of exorbitant prices and poor service. In fact, with 71&#13;
percent of trucks in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso older than 15 years, the quality of service is&#13;
low and the operating conditions of the majority of the trucks do not generate sufficient margins&#13;
capable of financing a more modern fleet (Figure 2.9).&#13;
&#13;

                                                                   15%&#13;

                                                                         9%&#13;
                        11 to 15 years&#13;
                        Over 15 years              71%&#13;

&#13;
2.27 Reversing that situation implies shifting away from current opaque practices for access to&#13;
the transport market towards a situation in which transport operators are recognized based on&#13;
their ability to provide quality transport services in a professional manner, in view of their&#13;
compliance with a number of access criteria. If combined with measures to enhance the&#13;
transparency of the allocation of cargo to transporters, a more competitive market structure will&#13;
emerge that would lower costs and bring prices more in line with costs. Hence, the restructuring&#13;
of the road transport sector requires addressing at least these two core issues:&#13;
&#13;
      -    Access to the profession of transport operator, for which regional regulations have&#13;
           been developed which cover most aspects, but with no or limited actual adoption by&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
    Data provided by SONATT (CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire), extracted from the trucking licenses database in August 2013&#13;
&#13;
                                                         14&#13;
&amp;#12;       member states. As a result of the revision of access criteria, some informal operators with&#13;
       limited capacity to comply will no longer be able to operate, creating space for&#13;
       professional operators to operate at greater efficiency and profitability.&#13;
&#13;
   -   Liberalization of access to the transport market, both domestic and international, to&#13;
       introduce competition so as to facilitate greater efficiency. A pivotal element in achieving&#13;
       this objective is the establishment of a â&#128;&#152;bourse de fretâ&#128;&#153;, which will provide significantly&#13;
       greater transparency in allocating freight. Furthermore, the breakdown of the monopoly&#13;
       of stevedoring companies in Abidjan is of importance in creating a more competitive and&#13;
       level playing field.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Gateway and inland terminal reform agenda&#13;
&#13;
2.28 The gateway and inland terminals operational efficiency agenda comprises three&#13;
dimensions. One is associated with the physical movements of the goods, one is associated with&#13;
the documentation processes through the border management agencies, and a third comprises a&#13;
governance dimension which impacts the pricing of gateway and terminal logistics services.&#13;
&#13;
2.29 In the documentation process, the border management agencies play a critical role&#13;
in international trade as they ensure the security of trade transactions, safeguarding&#13;
government revenue and protecting citizens from inadequate goods. However, in a context&#13;
of low compliance with trade regulations, there is a tendency to over-emphasize the security role&#13;
to the detriment of the trade facilitation role, as uniform approaches are applied to all&#13;
transactions, which multiplies controls for both legitimate and fraudulent transactions without&#13;
discrimination. This is compounded by low operational efficiency: logistics services depend on&#13;
the inefficient production, circulation and use of information among traders, logistics services&#13;
providers and regulatory agencies.&#13;
&#13;
2.30 Improving the documentation process requires therefore a two-pronged approach,&#13;
focusing on the one hand on the facilitation of legitimate trade transactions through the&#13;
promotion of compliance and better risk management (notably with Authorized Economic&#13;
Operators schemes and the provision of adequate training to border management agencies and&#13;
clearing agents personnel) while ensuring adequate security, and on the other hand on&#13;
operational efficiency through automation and provision of advance information that will allow&#13;
the processing of documents prior to the arrival of goods at the gateway (in particular through&#13;
Single Windows and connection of border management agencies).&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;· Promotion of compliance&#13;
&#13;
2.31 The main challenge of compliance and risk management is to attain a situation in&#13;
which compliant operators are adequately rewarded. At present, the generally low level of&#13;
compliance of trade or transport operators in the West Africa region leads to a reluctance of&#13;
control agencies to eliminate the multiple layers of control, which have accumulated over time,&#13;
which in turn hinder the smooth movement of goods and vehicles and reduce incentives for&#13;
operators to comply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               15&#13;
&amp;#12;2.32 With a view to achieving a higher level of compliance, countries in the region have&#13;
embarked on the establishment of an Authorized Economic Operator regime . A recently&#13;
conducted feasibility study concluded that countries on the Abidjan-Lagos corridor are ready for&#13;
such a program and a pilot is currently being prepared for CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, Ghana and Burkina&#13;
Faso.9&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;· Addressing fragmentation of information&#13;
&#13;
2.33 Lack of coordination of information in West Africa increases transaction costs and&#13;
times. Three locations are key in the supply chains along the corridors: the maritime gateway,&#13;
the inland borders and at destination. Bridging the information gap across stakeholders will&#13;
require identifying for each key location what information processed by each type of logistics&#13;
operator or control agency is critical for the others and then ensuring timely availability and&#13;
access:&#13;
&#13;
    -   To increase the certainty regarding the documentation process, it is important to make&#13;
        information widely available on the formalities that traders and logistics service providers&#13;
        have to comply with. This is the purpose of systems such as Trade Information Portals&#13;
        (TIP). The development of TIPs is currently supported for the UEMOA regional through&#13;
        the TFF funded UEMOA regional facilitation program.&#13;
    -   At the maritime gateway, advance preparation of the clearance/transit process (notably&#13;
        the advance submission of the shipâ&#128;&#153;s manifest and the Customs declaration), reduces the&#13;
        duration of goods in the port. A combination of regulatory provisions for advance&#13;
        declaration and an enabling system such as Single Windows coordinating and organizing&#13;
        the exchange of information among parties are the two avenues for reducing port dwell&#13;
        time. Figure 2.10 shows the impact of advance declarations on port dwell time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
 In 2010, the World Bank, the governments of the Abidjan Lagos Corridor member countries, the ECOWAS&#13;
Secretariat and the Private Investors for Africa (PIA) 9, conducted a feasibility study for Authorized Economic&#13;
Operator (AEO) in Nigeria, Benin, Togo, and Ghana to determine their readiness for such a program. The feasibility&#13;
study covered the aspects of: political will, prerequisites, private public cooperation framework, legal basis,&#13;
integrity, potential participants, compliance measurement and post clearance audit, relationship with the other&#13;
government agencies, border operations, and truck transport under a grant from the Trade Facilitation Facility&#13;
(TFF), which paves the way for other countries, notably Burkina Faso, to join the pilot when pre-requisites are met.&#13;

                                                                Port dwell time in days&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  -              Interconnection of Customs and other border management agencies across countries&#13;
                                 along the corridors, with the active involvement of the logistics services providers, is&#13;
                                 essential to establish an effective transit system that can reduce delays and reduce&#13;
                                 transport costs (and prices, provided the right market structure is in place, as discussed&#13;
                                 earlier).&#13;
&#13;
2.34 Regarding the physical clearing process, the critical issue concerns the interface&#13;
between the port and land transport, where the movement of trucks in urban areas is often&#13;
delayed by congestion caused by loaded trucks waiting immediately outside the port due to&#13;
limited storage capacity within the port, while in the opposite direction, the opaque allocation&#13;
practices described above around inland transport impose long waiting times for trucks before&#13;
obtaining a load, adding to the number of idle trucks in the port vicinity.&#13;
&#13;
2.35 Part of the problem is currently being solved with the creation in Abidjan of a short&#13;
term parking yard for trucks due to enter the port to pick up or deliver goods. However,&#13;
this measure needs to be supplemented by additional parking space outside the metropolitan&#13;
areas for longer term parking. This additional space should also include warehousing facilities&#13;
(developed by the port authority, by private logistics service providers, or by public entities from&#13;
the hinterland countries) expanding the limited capacity at the port.10&#13;
&#13;
2.36 The governance dimension of the gateway and inland terminals agenda has&#13;
consequences for the pricing of the services. Most logistics activities undertaken at the&#13;
gateways or at inland terminals are of a monopolistic nature, with very few companies providing&#13;
services. When a proper regulatory environment is in place, this does not create problems, but in&#13;
absence of oversight or with limited oversight capabilities within the public regulatory agencies,&#13;
this leaves the door open for market distortions. Countries usually address that risk by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
   The rationale for the development of additional warehousing capacity has been developed in the World Bank&#13;
study â&#128;&#152;Why Does Cargo Spend Weeks in Sub-Sahara Africa Ports?â&#128;&#153; One of the findings of the study was that long&#13;
port dwell times are often linked to the storage strategies of the shippers preferring to take advantage of lower&#13;
storage tariffs in ports rather than relying on third party or in-house facilities. In the case of Abidjan, where storage&#13;
is constrained, developing additional capacity has both economic and operational relevance.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 17&#13;
&amp;#12;establishing a regulator for port activities, in which stakeholders have consultative or decision&#13;
making status.&#13;
&#13;
2.37 As summarized in Nathan (2013), and drawing from other sources, the primary&#13;
inefficiencies along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou road transport corridor can be summarized&#13;
as follows:&#13;
&#13;
Gateway/Port Inefficiencies&#13;
   ï&#130;· Lack of single window&#13;
   ï&#130;· Low cargo storage costs at port encouraging lengthy dwell times&#13;
   ï&#130;· Customs clearance is a mix of electronic and manual processes (physical submission of&#13;
     cargo invoices and packing lists)&#13;
   ï&#130;· Lack of equipment for the GPS tracking system&#13;
   ï&#130;· Lack of truck parking/staging facilities&#13;
   ï&#130;· Monopoly on local Abidjan area deliveries from the port&#13;
&#13;
Trucking Industry Inefficiencies&#13;
   ï&#130;· Current incentives are to strip containers and overload trucks&#13;
   ï&#130;· Powerful transporter unions where trucking freight rates are â&#128;&#156;black boxâ&#128;? types of pricing,&#13;
      with predominant fixed costs and very limited variable costs&#13;
   ï&#130;· Lack of market transparency in business practices&#13;
   ï&#130;· Old and obsolete fleet operated by poorly qualified truckers&#13;
   ï&#130;· Low annual mileage per truck due to long wait times for obtaining freight&#13;
   ï&#130;· Unfair competition from nonprofessional truckers operating old vehicles leading to low&#13;
      freight rates that do not guarantee sufficient income for fleet renewal&#13;
&#13;
Transport and Trade Facilitation Inefficiencies&#13;
   ï&#130;· High port handling charges and shipping line charges&#13;
   ï&#130;· Lack of professionalism of freight forwarders&#13;
   ï&#130;· Unreliable Internet connection going down frequently delaying the clearing processes&#13;
   ï&#130;· Trucks overloading increases load factors and reduces rates&#13;
   ï&#130;· Too many checkpoints along Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor, probably the highest&#13;
      number compared to other West Africa corridors assessed&#13;
   ï&#130;· Informal payments and corruption&#13;
&#13;
The proposed regional DPO supports a package of reforms, both regional and national, intended&#13;
to address these inefficiencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.1     The road transport sector along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor is marked by a&#13;
form of organization that hinders its development and that of the broader economy.&#13;
Regulatory failures and the multiplicity of actors and institutions, both formal and informal, are&#13;
the root cause of significant disorganization and distortion in the sector. Deteriorating transport&#13;
infrastructure, particularly road infrastructure, is an additional contributing factor to&#13;
&#13;
                                                18&#13;
&amp;#12;underperformance, itself a function of the suboptimal regulatory and institutional environment.&#13;
Furthermore, the lack of appropriate incentives and access to finance for funding the renewal of&#13;
rolling stock, solicitation of bribes and racketeering among law enforcement agencies through&#13;
roadblocks and selective enforcement, and unnecessary and low-value-added services imposed&#13;
by syndicates and other actors have further led to a vastly under-performing sector. In sum, the&#13;
road haulage sector operates in an informal and precarious environment leading to considerable&#13;
vulnerability among the various actors (CIRES, 2010). This vulnerability is further exacerbated&#13;
by the planned reform program, which seeks to directly address many of these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.2     The sector is comprised of various actors/agents whose roles are rather formalized&#13;
in a fairly well-established institutional sense, though not all are formal institutions or&#13;
actors. These actors can be categorized into two groups: first, those in charge of regulating and&#13;
organizing the various activities of the sector (largely government ministries and state or quasi-&#13;
state institutions); and second, those that are directly engaged in the provision of trucking&#13;
services (road transport companies, drivers, freight forwarders, coxeurs, shippers and&#13;
stevedores). This section describes these various actors.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Regulatory Actors&#13;
&#13;
3.3     Without getting into specific details of the various government agencies involved&#13;
and their individual responsibilities, suffice it to say that the government, as in most&#13;
economies, is integrally involved in the regulation of the sector. At the national level in both&#13;
CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso, this involves several state actors, including technical ministries&#13;
(Ministry of Transport, Ministry of State, Ministry of Interior and Security). These technical&#13;
ministries are responsible for regulation around issues such as: transport sector policy;&#13;
international transport agreements, conventions and treaties; laws and regulations on road&#13;
transport and road traffic, including issues such as axle load limits; infrastructure provision,&#13;
including road maintenance and rehabilitation; vehicle standards and licensing; driver standards&#13;
and licensing; etc.&#13;
&#13;
3.4     In addition to technical ministries, other government agencies are also involved in&#13;
road transport, particularly policing entities, military and security agencies, and health, forest&#13;
and agricultural agencies. These entities are involved largely with enforcing regulations,&#13;
enhancing road safety, ensuring public safety and furthering national health, environmental and&#13;
security interests. In this respect, state institutions in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso, while&#13;
admittedly having their own unique institutional characteristics and while there remains&#13;
considerable room for improvement, do not deviate too far from the norm in terms of the role of&#13;
official government ministries.&#13;
&#13;
3.5     Unfortunately, while the state institutional structure is broadly appropriate,&#13;
application and implementation of many of these state functions deviates considerably&#13;
from good practice. This arises at both the level of the policy and regulatory environment,&#13;
which suffers from issues of regulatory transparency, state capture, inappropriate influence&#13;
peddling and corruption issues, and at the level of implementation and enforcement of existing&#13;
regulations and control mechanisms, as there is widespread inequitable and irregular&#13;
&#13;
                                               19&#13;
&amp;#12;enforcement, blatant rent seeking (corruption) within enforcement and oversight agencies, and&#13;
frequent disregard of existing rules and regulations and broad non-compliance across the sector.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Quasi-State Actors&#13;
&#13;
Office Ivorien des Chargers (OIC) â&#128;&#147; CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire&#13;
&#13;
3.6      The Office Ivorien des Chargers (OIC) is by definition a shippersâ&#128;&#153; council. It is an&#13;
organization that represents and defends the interests of importers, exporters, shippers, and the&#13;
users of transport services in the context of the delivery of their goods. The Ivorian Shippers'&#13;
Council (CIC) was created in 1969, and became the OIC in 1975. The overall vision of the OIC&#13;
is to contribute to the competitiveness of transport services and to facilitate foreign trade in CÃ´te&#13;
dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire. To do this, it has a mission to provide: direct assistance to shippers; collection and&#13;
analysis of relevant data and information on trade flows; negotiation of transport costs;&#13;
facilitating and contributing to efficient traffic flows; the provision of supporting infrastructure&#13;
for shippers; serving as an interface between government and private sector transport interests&#13;
and transport services users.&#13;
3.7      A decade or so ago, the allocation of freight to freight carriers was very formalized&#13;
and the OIC played a key role. The OIC, on behalf of shippers, provided to the Ministry of&#13;
Transportation information on the tonnage of goods requiring transportation within or through&#13;
CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire. The Ministry then provided this information to carriers unions (syndicats) and&#13;
these in turn were responsible for informing carriers and finding vehicles capable of transporting&#13;
the goods. This was particularly the case for transit traffic that was subject to the 1/3, 2/3 rule,&#13;
whereby 1/3 of the goods were to be transported on Ivorien trucks.&#13;
&#13;
3.8      This mode of operation is no longer in effect today, largely because the Ivorien truck&#13;
fleet is aging and incapable of hauling its 1/3 quota. Therefore, other ECOWAS carriers carry&#13;
the bulk of the merchandise. Nonetheless, there continues to be substantial collaboration between&#13;
the OIC and their counterpart shippersâ&#128;&#153; councils in other countries of the sub-region and with&#13;
some syndicats.&#13;
&#13;
3.9     The OIC also provides parking areas in cooperation with several town councils and&#13;
manages a two hectare truck parking area outside the port at Vridi and a 1.5 hectares parking&#13;
area at the Port of San Pedro. These spaces are designed to decongest roads around the port.&#13;
These parking areas are of two types: areas under Customs control and oversight; and â&#128;&#156;freeâ&#128;?&#13;
parking areas. The parking areas under Customs control are provided at the port of Abidjan and&#13;
San Pedro and at border crossings, and are primarily used for trucks containing goods in transit.&#13;
These goods are exempt from customs duties and taxes and oversight must be provided to ensure&#13;
goods are not off-loaded in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire. The â&#128;&#156;freeâ&#128;? parking areas provide somewhat secure&#13;
parking for trucks and rest areas for truck drivers near regional capitals and major areas of&#13;
production and distribution. Vehicles parked in these car parks pay a fee of 2,500 CFA francs&#13;
daily. Nonetheless, truckers complain of a lack of parking and rest facilities both around the port&#13;
and along the corridor, including a lack of security.&#13;

&amp;#12;Conseil BurkinabÃ¨ des Chargeurs (CBC) â&#128;&#147; Burkina Faso&#13;
&#13;
3.10 The CBC was established in 1978 to address challenges in transport related to the&#13;
country's landlocked status by minimizing international transport costs and streamlining supply&#13;
conditions. The CBC's tasks include: directly assisting shippers in their negotiations with&#13;
transporters -- in this regard the CBC maintains offices at all regional ports through which they&#13;
arrange transport for shipments destined for Burkina Faso; coordinate the interventions of the&#13;
various players in the transport chain in transit countries and in Burkina Faso, in order to reduce&#13;
the time and cost of transport; and make available to shippers and other economic operators,&#13;
information on the organization, costs and conditions of goods transport. The various tasks&#13;
entrusted to the CBC make it a strategic link in the goods transport chain, though its role as the&#13;
primary broker between shippers and transporters is diminishing as other players increasingly&#13;
enter this space. Besides the above mentioned tasks, the CBC also plays a role in representing&#13;
the Government of Burkina Faso with certain institutions including the Academy of Science and&#13;
Technology of the Sea, the Economic and Monetary Union of West Africa (UEMOA), the Union&#13;
of African Shippers' Councils, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Chamber of Commerce and Industry â&#128;&#147; Burkina Faso (CCI-BF)&#13;
&#13;
3.11 CCI-BF was founded in 1948 and is directly involved in the transport sector. The&#13;
CCI-BF plays the usual advisory role to public authorities in the fields of trade, industry and&#13;
services, and represents the business community in various institutions and organizations such as&#13;
the Economic and Social Council, the Privatization Commission, the International Chamber of&#13;
Commerce, etc. However, somewhat atypically, the CCI-BF provides several services directly to&#13;
transport operators in general and in particular to freight operators. It provides port, rail and road&#13;
terminals with warehouses and related infrastructure. Its terminal space includes more than&#13;
78,000m2, of which 52% is located in Burkina Faso and 65,000m2 of parking space of which one&#13;
third is located in the transit countries.&#13;
&#13;
3.12 Since 1980, CCI-BF has operated a 26 hectares terminal in Ouagadougou&#13;
specialized in domestic and international freight traffic. This terminal includes: three&#13;
warehouses of 5,000m2 of which one is Customs-bonded; a parking area of 28,800m2; offices of&#13;
2100m2; a 50 ton capacity weigh bridge; a further 10,000m2 area for maneuvering and parking; a&#13;
gas station concessioned to Shell and Total; and a 20 room hotel. Furthermore, the CCI-BF has&#13;
built a 19 hectares dry port at Bobo-Dioulasso including: a Customs-bonded warehouse of&#13;
approximately 2,275mÂ² and bonded parking of 36,500mÂ² for 268 trucks and an export warehouse&#13;
of approximately 600mÂ²; a container terminal area of about 18,500m2; a maintenance workshop;&#13;
a "foreign transit" zone, which is a space for merchandise trucks and tankers; and an un-bonded&#13;
warehouse of 2,457m2 and an unbonded parking area of 8,000m2 for 48 trucks; an administrative&#13;
area consisting of offices, control stations, parking lots, a weighbridge and pathways; and a&#13;
mixed use area including a police station, hotels, restaurants, cafes, banks, insurance offices,&#13;
etc.).&#13;
&#13;
Road Transport Training Center â&#128;&#147; Burkina Faso&#13;
&#13;
3.13 This training center plays an important role in the transport sector in Burkina Faso. It is&#13;
financially dependent on the CCI-BF, but is under the technical supervision of the Department of&#13;
&#13;
                                                 21&#13;
&amp;#12;Transport. It provides pre-service and ongoing training to State personnel as well as to the&#13;
private sector in road transport related fields including: driver training; road transport business&#13;
and entrepreneurial training; mechanics training; and driving instructor and inspector training.&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Private Sector Actors&#13;
&#13;
Shippers (Chargeurs)&#13;
&#13;
3.14 The shipper is the essentially the client in need of transport services. A shipper can&#13;
be an individual, a producer of goods, a distributor, or a firm that specializes in organizing the&#13;
transport of goods for other parties. The shipper is essentially the owner and possessor of all or&#13;
part of a lot of goods transported by truck, and may be the actual importer or exporter, depending&#13;
on the nature of the commercial contract. Shippers tend to deal with multiple&#13;
carriers/transporters, many deal in significant quantities and require frequent access to transport&#13;
services. They enter into contractual relationships with transporters based on the frequency of&#13;
delivery, volume, price, quality of service, and the possible relevant penalties or compensation&#13;
clauses. According to an official of the OIC, "the shipper is a legal or natural person who exports&#13;
and imports goods."&#13;
&#13;
3.15 Shippers are not homogenous however, and they vary in terms of volumes shipped and&#13;
frequency of shipments: some are regular shippers that are registered with the OIC for example&#13;
in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, while others are occasional shippers and may not be registered by their&#13;
respective shippersâ&#128;&#153; councils. In recent years in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire shippers have created Economic&#13;
Interest Groups (GIE) as a platform for exchange of expertise, to carry out certain common&#13;
operations and activities, and to defend the social and economic interests of their members.&#13;
&#13;
Freight Forwarders (Transitaires)&#13;
&#13;
3.16 The freight forwarder is a person or company authorized by the sender or recipient&#13;
of goods to act on their behalf in managing the shipping/transport process and related&#13;
transactions, including successive transport operations. Freight forwarders essentially play an&#13;
intermediation role in the business transaction routing system. They can be responsible for&#13;
completing the Customs formalities for importers and exporters and they manage the links&#13;
between separate individual carriers and thus ensure the continuity of transportation. In their&#13;
warehouses, freight forwarders manage the entry, inventory tracking and exit of goods, and in&#13;
their bonded facilities can provide storage for goods exempt from duties and taxes pending&#13;
international shipping.&#13;
&#13;
Stevedores (Acconiers)&#13;
&#13;
3.17 A stevedore is a company (or contractor) responsible for conducting dockside&#13;
handling operations. Those employed in loading and unloading ships, i.e., the individuals&#13;
involved, are also frequently referred to as stevedores. Legally, the stevedore is responsible for&#13;
the goods during loading, unloading and storage. In CÃ´te d'Ivoire, a distinction is sometimes&#13;
made between the dock-side handling (stevedores) and land-based handling (acconiers).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Transporters and Trucking Companies&#13;
&#13;
3.18 Access to the transport profession is regulated in both CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina&#13;
Faso. In order to enter the profession, one must register in advance, for example through&#13;
SONATT in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire. This registration results in the issuance of a certificate of registration&#13;
that is personal and non-transferable. It is available to: a) natural persons of Ivorien or BurkinabÃ©&#13;
nationality registering in their respective countries; and b) to legal entities regardless of the&#13;
nationality of their members. In addition to registering as a transporter, the carrier must also&#13;
seek authorization to transport, which is issued for each vehicle.&#13;
&#13;
3.19 Registration as a carrier and an authorization to transport permit gives the carrier&#13;
the right to practice and operate along the lines or routes assigned to each vehicle.&#13;
Registration also allows the person or entity the ability to join various professional organizations&#13;
(associations, trade unions, syndicats) and the access to infrastructure, equipment and funding&#13;
from the organizations of which it is member. Any entity that, for a period of more than a year, is&#13;
not in possession of an authorization to transport is determined to have ceased transport activity&#13;
and can be removed from the register of transporters.&#13;
&#13;
3.20 With respect its obligations, each registered carrier must: a) ensure the movement of&#13;
goods in line with all safety and other transport regulations in force; b) have appropriate&#13;
insurance to cover third-party liability; c) pay all transport related taxes and fees (license, VAT,&#13;
etc.); d) declare employees to the relevant authorities (Inspectorate of Labour and Social&#13;
Legislation, National Social Security Fund); and e) respect all provisions and measures related to&#13;
the movement of traffic.&#13;
&#13;
3.21 Transporters can be classified into two distinct groups: 1. those in good standing vis-&#13;
Ã -vis all modern and professional legal requirements relating to their activities; and 2. informal&#13;
transporters operating outside of current rules and regulations and/or not meeting required&#13;
standards. Formal, professional transporters can be legally established formal companies, but&#13;
can also be individuals that meet current standards and are operating formally as independent&#13;
owner-operator entities. These are companies which generally meet legal and modern&#13;
requirements, including access to the profession conditions and professional standards&#13;
(employment conditions, division of labor, remuneration guidelines, sound financial and&#13;
technical management, etc). These operations are in possession of a registration certificate and a&#13;
transport authorization permit for each vehicle. Employees are engaged on a formal basis, often&#13;
under contract. Under the terms of their employment contract, drivers cannot exceed 40 hours&#13;
per week. Many of these formal enterprises have their own garage where vehicles can be parked&#13;
and where technical and mechanical maintenance of their vehicles can be undertaken.&#13;
Furthermore, technical and administrative management within these firms is typically supported&#13;
by some training and based on employment is based on professional competence. Wages&#13;
typically exceed minimum wage standards. However, some formal firms are family businesses&#13;
who, even in these cases, operate professional and modern operations.&#13;
&#13;
3.22 In contrast, informal transporters/truckers (the large majority of transporters in&#13;
terms of numbers) are primarily owner-operator entities operating a single truck, or very few&#13;
trucks, that are not registered, and whose vehicles are not authorized and are often non-compliant&#13;
&#13;
                                                 23&#13;
&amp;#12;with current vehicle standards and licensing requirements. Vehicles owned by informal&#13;
operators tend to be old, in poor condition and are used infrequently or only during seasonal high&#13;
demand periods. Many informal operators are only engaged in trucking on a part-time basis and&#13;
do not rely solely on trucking for their livelihood. Nonetheless, there are some informal truckers&#13;
who are engaged full-time in the transport industry and some maintain a fleet of several trucks,&#13;
though they continue to operate informally and outside of the formal, regulated system.&#13;
&#13;
Drivers&#13;
&#13;
3.23 A driver is clearly an individual engaged as the operator of a truck/vehicle involved&#13;
in road transport. He/she can be an employee of a transport company or an owner-operator of&#13;
an individual truck(s). Formally a driver must be at least 21 years of age for vehicles carrying&#13;
more than eight persons (in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire) excluding the driver, and 18 years of age for vehicles&#13;
carrying up to eight people. Licensing is subject to the demonstration of specific professional&#13;
capabilities and depends on the type of license applied for and the vehicle category for which it&#13;
is to be applied. The driver is required to perform his/her duties in conformance with applicable&#13;
laws, rules and regulations and must follow the instructions of police, security and defense forces&#13;
when he/she encounters such agents.&#13;
Unions and Syndicats&#13;
&#13;
   ï?®      Syndicats in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire&#13;
&#13;
3.24 Unions (syndicats) in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire are organizations of carriers and/or drivers&#13;
whose main formal objective is to defend the interests of its members . In practice however,&#13;
syndicats provide a wide variety of services including: allocation of freight; parking and staging&#13;
areas; protection and security services; etc. A syndicat can be easily formed by depositing at the&#13;
Interior Ministry, the town hall, or in administrative districts where the headquarters of the union&#13;
is established the syndicatâ&#128;&#153;s statutes and by-laws. Although no particular form is imposed, the&#13;
statutes must identify the unionâ&#128;&#153;s leadership and management. The statutes often contain fairly&#13;
standard clauses, namely: the purpose of the syndicat; the headquarters location; internal&#13;
organizational structure; the geographical operating area; operating rules; the conditions for&#13;
amending the statutes; and the conditions of dissolution. Given the low threshold for creating a&#13;
syndicate, with no minimum number of members required, and little monitoring or enforcement&#13;
by the Ministry of Interior, there are over 250 syndicats in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, some with very small&#13;
membership bases and others with hundreds of members. Approximately 35% of truckers do not&#13;
belong to a syndicat.&#13;
&#13;
3.25 The modus operandi of syndicats and their management practices are very non-&#13;
transparent. Some would appear to be created for the sole purpose of extracting rents from&#13;
certain truckers and trucker groups, along the lines of protection rackets, while others appear to&#13;
be meaningfully committed to providing value-added services to its members. As an example,&#13;
one syndicate representative with a stated membership of 1,130 members welcomes the&#13;
envisaged government attempts at modernising the sector. He deplored that many syndicates are&#13;
principally hunting for freight and passengers and are not fulfilling their traditional role of&#13;
primarily representing the interests of their members. Competition among syndicates has&#13;
apparently increased and in the case of passenger traffic has resulted in a number of violent&#13;
&#13;
                                                24&#13;
&amp;#12;incidents. Conflicts over passengers and market share often play out in the parking complexes&#13;
(les gares, terrains de stationnement) that are usually managed by a number of syndicates, in that&#13;
they control access to passengers (or freight for that matter) through a tour de rÃ´le system.&#13;
Managing these gares has also become a source of income for syndicates, as truckers pay a fee to&#13;
enter and leave the parking areas.&#13;
&#13;
   ï?® Syndicats in Burkina Faso&#13;
&#13;
3.26 The road transport sector in Burkina is marked by the existence of several&#13;
transport unions, the best known of which are: the Organization of Road Transporters of&#13;
Burkina Faso (Organisation des Transporteurs Routiers du Burkina Faso -- OTRAF) and the&#13;
National Union of Road Transporters of Burkina (Syndicat National des Transporteurs Routiers&#13;
de Voyageurs du Burkina -- SNTRV-B).&#13;
&#13;
3.27 OTRAF is a union of freight and passenger carriers with branches in different regions&#13;
of the country, with â&#128;&#156;commissionsâ&#128;? covering different transport areas, i.e., oil, general cargo,&#13;
passengers, etc., and it plays an influential role in the organization and functioning of the sector.&#13;
OTRAF has representatives in the ports of Abidjan, LomÃ©, Cotonou, and Tema, which coexist&#13;
with CBC offices and representation. OTRAF negotiates rates for freight carriers and arranges&#13;
freight for its members if necessary. It receives and transmits to its members transport offers&#13;
received from CBC and in this regard matches available loads with available member truckers&#13;
following a â&#128;&#156;tour de roleâ&#128;? system where this function is still practised, including to a limited&#13;
extent at the Port of Abidjan.&#13;
&#13;
3.28 The SNTRV-B is a union of road passenger transport providers, which incorporates&#13;
to some extent the transport of goods. It aims to provide assistance in the harmonization of&#13;
supply and demand for public transport vehicles and the establishment of fair prices for both the&#13;
providers and users of passenger transport services. They are also working to have&#13;
representatives in the various Burkina transit ports alongside OTRAF.&#13;
&#13;
3.29 There are other trade union-based organizations that are also involved in the industry in&#13;
Burkina Faso. However, most of these organizations are located solely within the national&#13;
territory and many are of a local or provincial character.&#13;
&#13;
Coxeurs&#13;
&#13;
3.30 In CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire access to cargo used to be institutionally regulated. In the past, the&#13;
OIC would inform the Ministry of Transport of cargo needing to be transported. It was up to the&#13;
Ministry to then inform the truckersâ&#128;&#153; trade unions of available cargo who in turn were&#13;
responsible for informing carriers and finding vehicles capable of transporting the goods. This&#13;
process has now been abolished and in theory, the market has been liberalized. Thus, shippers&#13;
now have the right to negotiate directly with the carriers.&#13;
&#13;
3.31 In practice, access to cargo and loads usually pass through a coxeur. The coxeur is&#13;
the intermediary between the carrier, or where applicable the driver, and the merchant or shipper.&#13;
Coxeurs have a contact network of several traders, loaders, drivers and carriers. Coxeurs can also&#13;
&#13;
                                                 25&#13;
&amp;#12;on occasion deal with customs procedures and can work with freight forwarders. Coxeurs charge&#13;
a variable fee depending on the nature of the relationship with the customer and the quantity and&#13;
quality of the goods transported. Usually, this commission is about 50,000 CFAF per loaded&#13;
vehicle to Ouagadougou or Bamako. The contract between the coxeur and its customers is&#13;
typically via tacit understanding and is rarely in writing. This activity is dominated in and around&#13;
the Port of Abidjan by coxeurs of BurkinabÃ© and Malian origin.&#13;
&#13;
3.32 Coxeurs however, are not a homogeneous breed and practices vary widely. Indeed,&#13;
some truckers whose vehicles are not currently available or have no vehicle also play this role of&#13;
intermediary. This activity is also practiced by drivers, shopkeepers, and people of varying&#13;
capacity and backgrounds, but with some connection and knowledge of the industry. At times&#13;
practices of coxeurs can border on the coercive, predatory, and indeed illegal. For example,&#13;
many BurkinabÃ© drivers can be stranded at the port for weeks while they wait to unload their&#13;
cargo at the port and await a return shipment. Frequently they run out of money and must borrow&#13;
funds. Coxeurs will fill this gap, but then confiscate their â&#128;&#156;carte griseâ&#128;? without which they cannot&#13;
depart and insist that they arrange their next load at often non-market prices. Others run&#13;
protection rackets whereby waiting trucks will be vandalized unless protection money is paid or&#13;
the services of particular coxeurs are used. In sum, practices vary widely and the use of coxeurs&#13;
tends to drive a price wedge in-between shippers and transporters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.33 As can be noted from the discussion above, the road transport sector is&#13;
characterized by considerable heterogeneity across companies. For example, trucking&#13;
companies, are typically unincorporated personal businesses (87.2% in CÃ´te d'Ivoire and 72.7%&#13;
in Burkina Faso), while most freight forwarders are limited liability companies (63.2% in the&#13;
Ivory Coast against 48.8% in Burkina Faso).&#13;
&#13;
3.34 This heterogeneity exists across the two countries as well. The typology of carriers&#13;
reveals that most â&#128;&#156;companiesâ&#128;? (a â&#128;&#156;companyâ&#128;? meaning an operation that is in the trucking&#13;
business as its primary activity and typically operates more than one truck and engages more&#13;
than one employee) operate in the informal sector in CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Indeed, more than two out of&#13;
three (71%) are informal, against only one in five (19%) in Burkina Faso (Figure 3.1). A&#13;
company is considered formal if it has a taxpayer's account and keeps accounts of its business.&#13;
An informal company refers to those companies who fall outside of state regulation, taxation and&#13;
other state oversight. In addition to informal and formal companies, the analysis distinguishes&#13;
â&#128;&#156;artisansâ&#128;? who are defined as truckers that usually have only one vehicle and act as both manager&#13;
and driver.&#13;

&#13;
3.35 Truckers can also be differentiated as to whether they primarily haul freight for others&#13;
(public) or whether they haul freight principally on their own account (private). They can then&#13;
be further disaggregated by whether they are officially registered as a trucking company or offer&#13;
transport services without declaring as a transport company. Figure 3.2 provides the breakdown&#13;
of trucking interests along these lines.&#13;

3.36 Trucking is frequently not a full time activity, or is not the sole activity for many&#13;
firms. About 20% of road transporters (19.1% in the CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and 17.4% in Burkina Faso)&#13;
report being involved in other types of activities (see Table 3.1). In addition, in disaggregating&#13;
the data according to the whether the company is also involved in the transport of its own goods,&#13;
&#13;
                                                                        27&#13;
&amp;#12;we observe a higher proportion of carriers that diversify their activities. Indeed, more than four&#13;
Ivorian carriers in ten (41.03%) and about three Burkinabe transporters in ten (27.5%) among&#13;
those who transport their own goods are also involved in another activity. In CÃ´te d'Ivoire, the&#13;
average share generated by freight transport in the total turnover of the company is relatively&#13;
lower than in Burkina Faso (34.62% against 46.12% respectively). Compared to Burkina Faso,&#13;
the average revenue share generated by freight transport for these companies is relatively more&#13;
important (44.44%). The main other activity in which companies are involved is general trading&#13;
activities, which represents about 50% of total revenue.&#13;

3.37 The assets of a business can be a key element in determining success . In the case of&#13;
the transport sector, assets also provide some insight into the logistical capacity available to&#13;
enterprises and a firmâ&#128;&#153;s ability to conduct business in a professional manner. This can be&#13;
measured by the number of vehicles available to transport goods, but also by the availability of&#13;
parking spaces and storage facilities. Most transport companies in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina&#13;
Faso do not have private parking areas. Indeed, more than half of them use public parking areas&#13;
(70% in Ivory Coast and 55% in Burkina Faso). About one in five leases a parking lot (22% in&#13;
CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and 12.4% in Burkina Faso). Only 11% of Ivorian carriers have their own parking&#13;
space, while in Burkina Faso, the proportion was 25% (Figure 3.3).&#13;

3.38 Many carriers do not own storage space for goods under their control. In fact, about&#13;
eight out of ten carriers have no such facility. Burkinabe carriers have slightly more of such&#13;
facilities and this may be related to their greater geographic isolation and the need to stockpile&#13;
before transport, especially in serving the internal domestic market and other Sahelian countries&#13;
(Figure 3.4).&#13;

&amp;#12;3.39 Several types of vehicles are used by carriers in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso.&#13;
Tankers and flatbeds dominate the Burkinabe fleet (respectively 49.3% and 23.2% of the fleet),&#13;
while the Ivorian fleet is dominated by semi-trailers/van trucks (49%) and dump trucks (20%)&#13;
(Figures 3.5). Formal firms in Burkina Faso have a fleet dominated by tankers (61.3% of&#13;
enterprises), while the informal and artisanal fleet includes more semi-trailers/van trucks&#13;
(respectively 27.0% and 19.7 %) and flatbeds (33.3% and 23.6%, respectively) (Figure 3.5). This&#13;
can be explained by the fact that tankers are used to transport oil and gas from producing&#13;
countries and ports, including CÃ´te d'Ivoire to Burkina Faso. Indeed, tankers are the dominant&#13;
means of transport for companies engaged in international travel (60% of companies).&#13;
Transporting hydrocarbons necessitates formal contracts that require vehicles in good condition.&#13;
In addition, the transport of hydrocarbons is an ongoing activity with few fluctuations, while in&#13;
other areas of freight, supply fluctuates considerably, sometimes causing periodic suspension of&#13;
activities. Formal freight businesses have a tendency to get into the fuel transport business and&#13;
thus require the use of tankers. National traffic meanwhile is mainly provided by flatbed trucks&#13;
and semi-trailer/van trucks.&#13;

3.40 In CÃ´te d'Ivoire, semi-trailers/vans (49%) are the most frequent followed dump trucks&#13;
(20%). Semi-trailers/van trucks dominate international routes (79%) compared to domestic&#13;
routes (42%). This can be explained by the fact that international transport is done over long&#13;
distances and requires that the goods be better protected, i.e., covered and sealed. Large vans and&#13;
semi-trailers meet these requirements. Also, flatbeds used for transporting goods packed in&#13;
containers are also increasingly used by international carriers. In contrast, dump trucks used to&#13;
transport bulk goods, such as sand, gravel, etc., are used by carriers that do not cross borders&#13;
(24%) and rarely by international carriers (2%). The transport of hydrocarbons is done with&#13;
tankers, but in the case of CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire seems confined to domestic travel only as tankers&#13;
represent only 0.3% of CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoireâ&#128;&#153;s international fleet compared to 6% for domestic carriers.&#13;
&#13;
3.41 Both public and private freight carriers generally use their own trucks . However,&#13;
they may occasionally use rental trucks or enter into lease agreements. In CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire about&#13;
98% of trucks are owned while in Burkina Faso, the proportion is 89.4%. (see Table 3.2).&#13;

3.42 Analysis of the fleet in terms of age reveals an aging fleet, especially among informal&#13;
enterprises and artisans. An aged fleet is common to freight carriers in West Africa, though it&#13;
should be noted that the Ivorian fleet is older than that of Burkina Faso (Table 3.2). In CÃ´te&#13;
dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire trucks have an average age of 21 years with 89% being more than 10 years old. In&#13;
Burkina Faso, the average age is about 13 years, with only half the fleet over 12 years old.&#13;

Strategies for Truck/Fleet Renewal&#13;
&#13;
3.43 In CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, trucks used by the majority of carriers (80%) are either second -&#13;
hand vehicles (75.6%) or rehabilitated purchased vehicles (4.4%). Only 41% of freight&#13;
carriers are currently considering acquiring one or more trucks in the next 12 months. The&#13;
acquisition of new vehicles by carriers would reduce the frequency of breakdowns, avoid delays&#13;
in the delivery of goods, contribute to improving the quality of road transport services, and&#13;
increasingly protect the environment.&#13;
&#13;
3.44 In Burkina Faso, truckers have benefited from tax relief on taxes on imported&#13;
vehicles. These measures, have allowed for some fleet renewal and this is evident in the age of&#13;
the fleet. The purchase of new vehicles and the purchase of second-hand vehicles (used) are the&#13;
two main vehicle acquisition modes in Burkina Faso. The majority (65.3%) of the vehicle fleet in&#13;
Burkina Faso are second-hand vehicles and over 85% of all freight transport companies employ&#13;
used vehicles. New vehicles represent 30% of vehicles in the fleet and are held by 10.7% of&#13;
companies.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    33&#13;
&amp;#12;3.45 Access to financing is an essential element in fleet renewal and is a concern for any&#13;
operators in both the formal and informal sectors. Financing can be a constraint at both the&#13;
start of a trucking venture and in the ongoing operation of the business. Access to finance for&#13;
most private sector actors is generally based on financial and banking institutions that require&#13;
collateral. Unfortunately, this is not always within reach of small and medium enterprises, and&#13;
appears to be a particular constraint to trucking enterprises. Most carriers are forced to finance&#13;
their vehicle purchases with own-equity, resort to informal loans, or obtain assistance from their&#13;
family. In CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, the primary modes of financing truck purchases are: first self-financing&#13;
(85.5%), followed by rent-to-own (5%), informal loans (4.5%), family loans (2%), and bank&#13;
loans (2%). In Burkina Faso vehicle purchases are funded in whole or in part by self-financing&#13;
(78%) and bank loans (26%) (Figure 3.7). These differences between the two countries may&#13;
reflect the efforts of the BurkinabÃ© government and the programs it implemented to encourage&#13;
fleet renewal.&#13;

&#13;
3.46 Limited access to the banking system can perhaps be explained by the nature of freight&#13;
carriers. Indeed, road transport freight companies in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso tend to be&#13;
micro-enterprises (with less than 5 trucks) and very few keep regular accounts and pay taxes.&#13;
This reflects the high level of informality among freight carriers and hinders access to the formal&#13;
banking system. These carriers, like most small entrepreneurs in Africa, are rarely able to meet&#13;
the requirements of financial institutions. They are considered high risk and the formal financial&#13;
sector lacks information about their repayment capacity and their ability to provide and&#13;
guarantee collateral is limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.1     In support of their national development plans, the Governments of CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire&#13;
and Burkina Faso have prepared a comprehensive program of reform for the transport&#13;
sector. The program focuses on a number of reforms, such as the reform of driversâ&#128;&#153; and vehicle&#13;
licenses, the professionalization of the trucking industry and the adoption of more stringent&#13;
                                                     34&#13;
&amp;#12;criteria for access to the profession. The common vision of the two countries for modernization&#13;
of their transport sectors is spelled out in the joint Letter of Development Policy, which&#13;
accompanies the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s program document. The LDP presents the medium-term reform&#13;
strategy of the two countries for modernization of their transport sectors and of operations along&#13;
the Abidjan-Ouagadougou, taking into account both transport and customs-related aspects.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Burkina Fasoâ&#128;&#153;s Transport Reform Program&#13;
&#13;
4.2     The transport sector is a major component of Burkin a Fasoâ&#128;&#153;s development strategy.&#13;
Noting that high transport costs remain a major impediment to Burkina's competitiveness and&#13;
growth, their Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development (SCADD)&#13;
emphasizes the necessity of improving the transport and logistics sectors in order to achieve the&#13;
country's long-term development goals. In addition to investment in better infrastructure, the&#13;
SCADD explicitly mentions the need to introduce measures enabling the emergence of&#13;
professional and efficient transport companies. Complementing the SCADD, a revised&#13;
Transport Strategy for the period 2011-2025 was adopted by the Government in December 2011&#13;
to guide the development of policies enabling profitable investment in the sector and maximizing&#13;
its contribution to growth and competitiveness.11 This document provides a diagnostic of the&#13;
constraints affecting transport in Burkina Faso, including:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Obsolete or incomplete nature of legal texts regulating access to the road transport&#13;
         profession and defining the nature of various transport sub-sectors;&#13;
     ï&#130;·   High costs and long delays on the corridors linking Burkina to the coast and at maritime&#13;
         gateways, compared to other corridors in Sub-Saharan Africa;&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Freight transport services characterized by a high number of small, unprofessional&#13;
         operators with a dilapidated fleet, poor management practices, and low profitability and&#13;
         investments;&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Inefficient practices, such as the stripping of containers at the ports and the queuing&#13;
         system (tour de rÃ´le) for trucks, which contribute to the survival of inefficient operators&#13;
         and negatively impact the profitability of the sector;&#13;
     ï&#130;·   High cost of container warranties and the short time allocated to transporters to return&#13;
         them, which creates pressures for container stripping.&#13;

plan for the transport sector. The Ministry of Transport recently presented its strategy to&#13;
improve transport in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and facilitate exchanges along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou&#13;
corridor.12 As outlined in 4.2 below, an important part of this strategy concerns policy reforms&#13;

&amp;#12;to modernize the road transport sector. The program focuses on a number of reforms, such as the&#13;
reform of driversâ&#128;&#153; and vehicle licenses and the professionalization of the trucking industry, by&#13;
adopting revised criteria for access to the profession. Fleet renewal schemes will provide&#13;
incentives for accepting and implementing the reforms.&#13;

4.4    The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Regional Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness Development Policy&#13;
Credit (RTFCC) is designed to support the reform efforts of the Burkinabe and Ivoirian&#13;
Governments. This innovative Development Policy Operation (DPO) addresses previously&#13;
unsolved issues affecting trade and transport by offering a common framework for coordinating&#13;
reforms in the two countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;4.5     The objective is to reduce trade and transport transaction costs in order to promote&#13;
development of the private sector and improve the business environment in the two&#13;
countries, with the aim of facilitating their integration with the global economy. Given the&#13;
importance of trade for the poor, both to create income opportunities and to reduce the cost of&#13;
living, this operation is fully consistent with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s twin goals of ending extreme poverty&#13;
and promoting shared prosperity. By lowering the currently high transport costs, facilitating trade&#13;
and promoting regional integration, the reforms supported by this program are expected to have&#13;
broad-based welfare gains in both countries, benefiting producers of exported products&#13;
(including farmers), consumers of imported goods and firms using imported inputs, among&#13;
others.&#13;

4.6     While there are clear economic benefits emanating from reforms areas supported&#13;
by the proposed operation, several of the measures will also likely have significant poverty&#13;
and social impacts on vulnerable segments of the population. The reforms supported by the&#13;
RTFCC series are designed to facilitate transport and trade, and are thus expected to generate&#13;
significantly positive economic, employment and welfare effects at the national level in the two&#13;
countries. To the extent that these reforms will reduce the costs of importing and exporting&#13;
goods, they should also have a positive impact on poverty reduction. These benefits should be&#13;
particularly important for Burkina Faso, where lower transport prices and enhanced efficiency of&#13;
logistics services for the movement of food staples will improve food security by preventing the&#13;
loss of crops during transport, while helping to strengthen the competitiveness of traditional&#13;
exports such as cattle from landlocked countries in the Sahel. This will benefit in particular&#13;
women, many of whom are involved in small businesses and have much to gain from lower&#13;
transport prices and better access to markets. However, given that the trucking industry in West&#13;
Africa is comprised largely of an over-supply of small independent and largely informal truckers&#13;
who operate on relatively thin profit margins, the impact of trucking sector reforms will be&#13;
considerable for those operators who may not be able or willing to comply with a stricter&#13;
regulatory framework for access to the profession.&#13;
&#13;
4.7     The assessment of the poverty and social impact will, therefore, attempt to ascertain the&#13;
extent to which different actors in the trucking business are affected and what coping&#13;
mechanisms and mitigation measures may be employed. This PSIA, in the subsequent sections,&#13;
essentially assesses the impact of this broad road transport sector reform program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        40&#13;
&amp;#12;5.1      This section draws on a study commissioned by USAID, in association with the&#13;
World Bank, and undertaken by Nathan Associates Inc.13 That report was prepared as an&#13;
initial analysis of the impact of regional road transport reform in the lead up to the consideration&#13;
and design of a regional road transport development policy operation. The report summarized&#13;
the situation of the West African trucking industry and designed and computed a model for&#13;
calculating the impact of reform on the industry and the regional economy.&#13;
&#13;
5.2     Two scenarios were explored in order to define the benefits and costs of a package of&#13;
reforms, including axle load controls, elimination of quotas, queuing and the ban on freight&#13;
transport in one country by truckers from another country, subsidies for truck fleet&#13;
modernization, and major reductions in en route checkpoints and border transit times. The first&#13;
scenario assumed that the shares of transit traffic would remain the same between coastal and&#13;
landlocked trucking fleets, while the second scenario examined shifts in those shares to lower&#13;
cost operators. Both scenarios assumed that axle load controls reduce overloading of transit&#13;
trucks by 97 percent.&#13;
&#13;
5.3     The net benefit to the regional economy from these reforms was estimated at&#13;
US$400â&#128;&#147;US$500 million per year, one-third of which would be attributable to axle load&#13;
controls and the rest to other reforms. Governments could be expected to save US$200-US$300&#13;
million in road maintenance, while the trucking industry (and especially the number of informal&#13;
operators) would shrink as a result of productivity increases and less waiting time in queues at&#13;
ports and border posts.&#13;
&#13;
5.4    Under these scenarios, transport costs per ton-km are expected to decrease by 20&#13;
percent and transport prices by 19 percent. This would create the conditions necessary for an&#13;
increase in the value of transit trade by about 8 percent. The regional trucking industry would&#13;
gain about US$60 million in net revenue, while shippers, producers, and consumers in&#13;
landlocked countries could gain US$200 million in net economic benefits.&#13;

5.5     Among individual stakeholders and industry participants, the major losers&#13;
identified would be informal sector truckers, who would be expected to lose 16,000 jobs,&#13;
although many would gain by shifting to the formal sector. According to the model, 150,000 to&#13;
650,000 trade-related jobs would be created, substantially more and an order of magnitude larger&#13;
than the jobs that would be lost in the trucking industry.&#13;
&#13;
5.6    The study cautioned that there could be resistance to lower prices for transport by&#13;
some stakeholders. This could create a critical problem since lower prices are needed to trigger&#13;
additional trade growth. If transport prices are not allowed to fall under the influence of market&#13;
pressures, there would be much less influence on trade, although a continuation of past relative&#13;

&amp;#12;modest growth is likely, even with restraints on competition. This scenario would have less&#13;
benefit for the region and policies should be targeted to avoid it.&#13;
5.7     Finally the report noted that there may be a need for a campaign to educate&#13;
stakeholders about the broader benefits of the reforms related to achieving additional&#13;
growth and its benefits. In sum, it was recommended that trucking industry reforms be initiated&#13;
in West Africa as the benefits are clearly much larger than the costs. These reforms should&#13;
include mechanisms to mitigate the impact on informal sector truckers, such as compensating&#13;
those bearing the greatest loss and providing job retraining.&#13;
&#13;
5.8    The regional DPO has taken these findings and recommendations into account and&#13;
this PSIA provides greater detail on the potential negative impact on vulnerable groups and&#13;
potential compensatory measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.9      The above brief summary of the macroeconomic impact of the planned reforms&#13;
clearly notes the significant benefits to the economies of the region that can be gained&#13;
through thoughtful road transport reform. The following discussion and tables highlight the&#13;
macroeconomic impact of the reforms on CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso specifically. It should&#13;
be noted that the impacts, both positive and negative, are magnified in Burkina Faso as compared&#13;
to CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire given the dichotomy in impacts between land-locked countries and coastal&#13;
countries. Land-locked countries stand to benefit much more at the macroeconomic level from&#13;
the provision and availability of more efficient, more effective, more reliable, and lower cost&#13;
transport services. Nonetheless, given the nature of existing road transport conventions and&#13;
institutions, individual truckers and industry players in land-locked countries currently benefiting&#13;
from a somewhat protected domestic road transport industry also stand to potentially lose more&#13;
at the individual level. In sum, the reforms imply a more meaningful change for Burkina Faso&#13;
than for CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire with resultant more positive macro impacts in Burkina Faso, but also&#13;
accompanied by more adjustment and dislocation at the micro/industry level.&#13;
&#13;
5.10 The following presentation of the estimated impacts illustrate this well and begins at&#13;
the level of the trucking/transport industry and then extends to the broader macroeconomic&#13;
impacts.&#13;
&#13;
5.11 The package of reforms supported under the Regional DPO are expected to have&#13;
the following direct impact on business practices, which will lead to the expected outcomes&#13;
noted and presented in the tables and discussion below:&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Reduction of waiting times in queues to get loads in favor of direct contracting or&#13;
       contracting through cargo brokers;&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Restriction of transit transport to operators, drivers and vehicles with modern,&#13;
       professional certification;&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Provision of either direct subsidies or reduced import tariffs for modern truck purchases&#13;
       and/or subsidized loans for truck purchases;&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Reduction of waiting times at borders and checkpoints;&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Reduction of informal payments by truckers;&#13;
&#13;
                                                42&#13;
&amp;#12;     ï&#130;·     Increases in cabotage trucking by transit operators from corridor countries.&#13;
&#13;
5.12       In addition, there will be indirect effects that are expected to result in:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·     An increase in the proportion of formal trucking operators (to 80 percent of transit&#13;
           trucks);&#13;
     ï&#130;·     An increase in the proportion of larger trucks (as transit operators trade up with new&#13;
           purchases);&#13;
     ï&#130;·     A related decrease in the percent of overloaded vehicles;&#13;
     ï&#130;·     An increase in the annual mileage for trucks engaged in transit of 20,000 km per year due&#13;
           to reduced wait times at checkpoints and borders;&#13;
     ï&#130;·     An increase in load factors by 10 percent for transit trucks due to cabotage operations.&#13;
&#13;
5.13 The impacts detailed below are centered primarily on transit trade as the original&#13;
intention of the Regional DPO was to improve transit trade and road transport efficiency&#13;
along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor. However, it should be recognized that the&#13;
supported reforms will also increase efficiency and reduce trucking prices for domestic trucking.&#13;
While the reforms are focused largely on the regional aspects of road transport reform, the&#13;
supported reforms will have a direct impact on domestic road transport as well, including a&#13;
demonstration effect on domestic truckers as the number of modern formal sector transit trucking&#13;
operators increases.&#13;

5.14 The number of trucks in the total transit trucking fleets is expected to decline with&#13;
reforms under both scenarios by about 800 to 1,000 vehicles, or some 11 to 14 percent of&#13;
the 7,100 transit vehicle fleet. This will lead to a decrease in direct trucking industry&#13;
employment of around 2,500 jobs, a loss which is more than compensated for by much larger job&#13;
increases in other sectors arising from increased trade as discussed further below. There is a&#13;

  Scenario 1 assumes no change in the current shares of landlocked country and coastal country haulage along the&#13;
corridor. Scenario 2 incorporates expected changes in the shares of haulage by coastal and landlocked countries to&#13;
favor countries with the lowest transport costs.&#13;

5.16 Net transport revenue after costs for transit truck operators calculated by the model for&#13;
the two countries is estimated to increase by about US$15 to US$60 million with a significant&#13;
shift toward CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire under scenario 2, though both countries are net beneficiaries of the&#13;
reforms. This net effect includes the combined effects of increased productivity, lower unit&#13;
operating costs and increased revenue from increased demand and cabotage operations. This is a&#13;
conservative estimate of total benefits to truckers.&#13;

5.17 Estimated cost savings to truckers following reform implementation should be&#13;
significant and should increase profitability in the industry, as illustrated in Table 5.4. An&#13;
important takeaway from this is that from a poverty perspective, while the number of truckers&#13;
may decline as noted above, those remaining in the industry will be more profitable and will&#13;
benefit from higher incomes. As such, the reforms should have a significant impact on lowering&#13;
poverty levels among the significant number of operators remaining in the industry. Cost&#13;
savings in the neighborhood of 20 percent are envisaged and when combined with increased&#13;
demand and increased utilization rates should lead to significantly increased profits and incomes&#13;
for truckers and their families.&#13;

5.18 Average transport prices should also fall as estimated in Table 5.5. Shippers should&#13;
benefit from increased efficiency in the transport industry as reflected in price decreases of&#13;
approximately 20 percent. These price savings will also be accompanied more intangible and&#13;
more difficult to quantify benefits such as improved reliability and predictability, faster delivery&#13;
periods, reduced damage to goods, etc. These additional benefits could be at least as significant&#13;
to shippers and consumer of transport services as the price reductions.&#13;

5.19 In addition to direct impacts on truckers and shippers, there will be impacts on&#13;
government expenditures. Table 5.6 summarizes these impacts and it should be noted that the&#13;
model estimated impacts on governments only from the expenditure side. There will be&#13;
additional benefits in the form of increased import and export duties and losses or gains related&#13;
to licensing fees, etc., but these are not included in the estimates. Additional expenditures are&#13;
related to compensatory measures to accommodate the reforms, such as subsidies to facilitate&#13;
truck purchases and financing costs. These could clearly vary depending on program&#13;
parameters, but are estimated here based on the expected level of fleet renewal and&#13;
modernization. Savings to governments are directly related to lower road maintenance costs&#13;
stemming from reduced axle loads. Expenditures on compensatory measures will be one-time&#13;
expenses while savings will be ongoing, as explained in footnote 11.&#13;

5.20 Of course, the impact of road transport reform go far beyond the direct impact on&#13;
truckers, shippers and governments. Approximately US$42 million annually in economic&#13;
benefits is provided to regional consumers, with shippers and producers receiving some $34&#13;
million in direct benefits annually. Burkina Faso, being landlocked, benefits the most as it&#13;
enjoys additional trade and producer and consumer price savings from improved transit trade.&#13;
Total benefits across both countries are on the order of US$140 million to US$174 million when&#13;

5.21 High transport/logistics costs paid by importers and exporters and the unreliability&#13;
of the transport/logistics system depress trade. This includes transport tariffs paid by&#13;
importers and exporters and high logistics costs paid by both importers and exporters. Increased&#13;
competition and efficiency in the road transport industry due to reform and liberalization will&#13;
decrease transport tariffs, increase reliability and predictability, decrease logistics costs and,&#13;
ultimately, expand trade. More reliable transport service and lower tariffs will also facilitate the&#13;
integration of local companies into global supply chains. Trade gains are obtained by combining&#13;
trade creation and trade substitution effects. Since transport inefficiencies are more important for&#13;
imports, they would be most affected initially and the analysis focuses on the projected impact&#13;
on imports. Nevertheless, improvement of corridor efficiency would affect exports as well as&#13;
imports. Increased import volumes would benefit local consumers (including local companies&#13;
relying on foreign inputs) by increasing their consumer surplus, but it may also create a loss for&#13;
&#13;
15&#13;
   Subsidy costs (first impact noted in the table) are a one-time expense, while savings in road maintenance and&#13;
repair are ongoing projected annual savings. Nonetheless, savings in first year more than cover the cost associated&#13;
with an accompanying measure related to purchase and interest subsidies to allow for trucker transition over the&#13;
reform period.&#13;
&#13;
                                                         46&#13;
&amp;#12;some local manufacturers, whose products could be replaced by cheaper imports. However,&#13;
increased export volume would benefit local producers by opening market opportunities.&#13;
Overall, trade creation effects are expected to be much larger than trade substitution effects.&#13;
&#13;
5.22 The increases in trade to landlocked Burkina Faso forecast in this model amount to&#13;
US$380 million annually, see Table 5.8. These are related primarily to responses to price&#13;
changes which result in an increase in demand for imports and an increase in supply of exports.&#13;
This is a conservative estimate since it does not take into account the general improvement in&#13;
logistics service which will result from these reforms. The improved logistics systems may be an&#13;
equally effective catalyst for increased trade as the lower costs. Gains from more efficient and&#13;
cost-effective road transport could be expected in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire as well, but since the model&#13;
focuses on the impact of improved transit transport, these are not estimated for CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire.&#13;

5.23 Table 5.9 presents the net employment effect of the proposed reforms â&#128;&#147; between&#13;
60,000 and 220,000 new jobs in Burkina Faso and an ambiguous outcome in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire.&#13;
The model calculates two types of indirect impact on employment: (1) the indirect effects of&#13;
direct employment changes in the trucking industry, and (2) the indirect effects on employment&#13;
related to the increase in trade.&#13;
&#13;
5.24 The trade effects are an order of magnitude larger than the trucking employment&#13;
effects. Trade increases have a variety of employment impacts. For imports of consumer goods&#13;
there are retail jobs, delivery and distribution jobs and import service jobs and their multipliers.&#13;
For intermediate goods and exports there are distribution and logistics jobs, processing and&#13;
related services with their multipliers. Research has been undertaken in West Africa in this&#13;
area,16 and the resulting multipliers were used to calculate low and high estimates of the impacts&#13;
as shown in Table 5.9. What is clear from this table is that even by these low estimates trade&#13;
impacts on employment more than compensate for losses in trucking-related industries.&#13;

Summary of Macro level Impacts&#13;
&#13;
5.25 The results presented above clearly illustrate a significantly positive macro level&#13;
impact that will increase economic activity, hence growth, reduce transport costs and prices,&#13;
hence reducing factor costs, increase imports and exports, and result in increases in consumer&#13;
and producer surplus. The macro effect on poverty should thus be unambiguously positive and&#13;
large.&#13;
&#13;
5.26 Nonetheless, the analysis also indicates that there are a variety of impacts on&#13;
different stakeholders and that these individual impacts differ between the two countries.&#13;
It is clear from the model that the biggest winners among the stakeholders are:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Shippers, consumers, and producers in landlocked Burkina Faso;&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Government road maintenance agencies;&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Formal sector truckers in all countries;&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Informal sector truckers who can afford to modernize their fleets.&#13;
&#13;
Smaller but positive gains are expected for:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Shippers, consumers, and producers in coastal CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire;&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Truckers in both countries since the sector as a whole will have increased transit earnings&#13;
        following reforms.&#13;
&#13;
The main losers appear to be informal sector truckers who cannot afford to modernize&#13;
their fleets or who do not want to join the formal sector. This is the subject of the following&#13;
section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.1     As the previous discussion has highlighted, the road transport sector in West Africa,&#13;
including in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso, suffers from a lack of competitiveness&#13;
emanating from high costs and resultant high transport prices. Transport costs directly and&#13;
indirectly affect price structures across other economic sectors and contribute to a lack of internal&#13;
and external economic competitiveness. In response, the ministries of transport in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire&#13;
and Burkina Faso have undertaken a series of reforms in the transport sector, which are being&#13;
supported through the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s regional budget support operation. The reforms are focused on six&#13;
main areas: 1. professionalization and modernization of the transport sector; 2. fleet renewal; 3.&#13;
improving corridor management and control; 4. improving port efficiency and reducing the cost&#13;
of port transit; 5. promoting containerization; and 6. improving road conditions and reducing the&#13;
cost of maintaining the infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
6.2    These reforms, while expected to have large positive economy-wide impacts, will&#13;
have differential impact on specific actors within the goods transport industries in both&#13;
countries. It is important to understand these impacts in order to properly formulate and&#13;
&#13;
                                                 48&#13;
&amp;#12;sequence reforms, but also to consider, design and implement accompanying measures in order&#13;
to mitigate potentially adverse effects on transport actors.&#13;
&#13;
6.3     As with any significant reform program, it may not be, and indeed is generally not&#13;
possible, to insulate all players from any and all negative impacts. In the end, there will be&#13;
winners and losers as is inherent in processes involving economic progress and structural&#13;
transformation. The purpose of the exercise undertaken and reported on in this section is to&#13;
identify those groups that may be most vulnerable to the changes brought about by the reform&#13;
program, to understand the scope and scale of the impact on these groups, to obtain their&#13;
perceptions on the reforms and potential impacts, and to suggest measures that could reduce or&#13;
mitigate to some extent the negative consequences identified.&#13;
&#13;
6.4     It is in this context that broad discussions were held with industry stakeholders to&#13;
identify potential impacts and suggested accompanying measures. The results of these&#13;
discussions and interviews are presented below and represent the views and perceptions of&#13;
industry participants. They largely confirm the more quantitative approach presented in the&#13;
previous section, but provide a perhaps more nuanced and personal perspective on the reforms&#13;
and potential impacts. For the most part, industry participants were positive and supported the&#13;
reforms, recognizing the necessity of the reforms though noting that for some groups adjustment&#13;
will be more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
6.5     The discussion is presented by reform area17 and industry participant groupings.&#13;
&#13;
Reform Area #1: Business environment that promotes professionalization of the freight&#13;
transport industry&#13;
&#13;
6.6     Reforms in this area, including revision of legislation and regulation concerning access to&#13;
the industryâ&#128;&#148;trucker certification, licensing, professional standards, technical requirementsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
will have an impact on jobs and livelihoods after the planned transition phase. While some&#13;
existing small informal truckers can potentially be absorbed into more formal firms as employees&#13;
or contract operators, and while others may organize into cooperative type structures or&#13;
groupement dâ&#128;&#153;intÃ©rÃªts Ã©conomiques (GIEâ&#128;&#153;s) to continue operating, some will be unable to meet&#13;
new standards and over time will exit the industry. Those most vulnerable in this regard tend to&#13;
be older, illiterate informal truckers and coxeurs unwilling or unable to find employment&#13;
elsewhere in a more professional and modernized transport industry.&#13;
&#13;
6.7     Stakeholders affected positively will include bigger, modern and more commercialized&#13;
operators. Smaller truckers (including many informal truckers) with the capacity to modernize,&#13;
professionalize and possibly expand their operations will also benefit from the reform. This&#13;
positive impact will extend to current and future employees of these more modern and&#13;
professional trucking companies. Increased demand for services, higher profits and greater&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
  The reform areas do not align exactly in their presentation with those presented in the DPO matrix of reforms as&#13;
the PSIA work proceeded concurrently with the preparation of the DPO and changes in the DPO program document&#13;
were ongoing. For purposes of the PSIA the reform groupings were maintained as originally conceived.&#13;
Nonetheless, the reforms analyzed are consistent across the PSIA and the DPO, though their presentation and&#13;
groupings may differ somewhat in how they are presented.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       49&#13;
&amp;#12;utilization of trucking assets should lead to increased returns and increased incomes among these&#13;
groups.&#13;
&#13;
6.8     Stakeholders affected negatively will include primarily informal truckers as well as&#13;
individual and small operators that are unable to modernize, including their employees, in both&#13;
Burkina Faso and CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire. Many of these informal, small and individual operators provide&#13;
services with dilapidated and poorly maintained trucking fleets and will unable to operate once&#13;
the reforms take full effect. The reforms will likely result in loss of jobs for some or the inability&#13;
of individual operators to continue in the trucking business.&#13;
&#13;
6.9     Interviews and focus group discussions identified those most vulnerable among the&#13;
vulnerable groups as being the older, illiterate, informal truckers who are nearing&#13;
â&#128;&#156;retirementâ&#128;? and are unwilling to contemplate modernization and professionalization .&#13;
Some of these felt they could continue to serve local informal markets and continue to struggle&#13;
for a period in the midst of a reforming and modernizing industry.&#13;
&#13;
6.10 Within an increasingly professionalized business environment, trucking should&#13;
become a more profitable and sustainable venture for trucking companies and individual&#13;
operators. In the current environment and under current practices, the over-supply of trucking&#13;
services (including from informal truckers) has driven prices down, making it difficult for&#13;
truckers to remain profitable. While some informal truckers may be unable or unwilling to&#13;
operate in the new environment, many of these have been finding it difficult to operate profitably&#13;
in the current environment and many were, often unknowingly, operating at a loss. As such, for&#13;
many leaving the industry this may, in a kind of perverse sense, represent a positive step from an&#13;
income, livelihood and poverty status.&#13;
&#13;
       Formal Truckers&#13;
&#13;
6.11 The impact on formal truckers is expected to be by and large positive. In both CÃ´te&#13;
dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso, big operators welcome the move towards increased&#13;
professionalization of the business environment as the current environment constrains the&#13;
profitability of transport businesses along the AOC corridor. In CÃ´te Dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, some concern&#13;
was expressed among some big operators regarding the loss of previous contracts that have&#13;
already been entered into with shippers given the impending implementation of the freight&#13;
exchange system. However, it was recognized that this system will likely benefit all truckers,&#13;
including large operators, but especially those who have difficulty gaining access to freight to&#13;
transport.&#13;
&#13;
       Informal and Artisanal Truckers&#13;
&#13;
6.11 Small and artisanal truckers, in individual interviews and focus group discussions,&#13;
expressed a strong willingness to professionalize and to be part of the modern transport&#13;
sector. In Burkina Faso, a number of small operators noted that they were unable to gain access&#13;
to freight due to the proliferation of informal intermediaries, including coxeurs. Provided that&#13;
these smaller operators can make good on their willingness to modernize and are able to adhere&#13;
to the requirements of a professionalized transport industry, they perceive the freight exchange&#13;
system as enabling them to access more freight and to remain profitable.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 50&#13;
&amp;#12;6.12 Nonetheless, the requirements for professionalization could be cumbersome for&#13;
some informal truckers, especially artisanal truckers that often tend to have just single trucks,&#13;
and for whom trucking is an additional or secondary trade (although there may be some for&#13;
whom the trucking business is their sole trade). In the absence of other activities they can&#13;
transition to, this reform area will likely have a negative impact on them.&#13;
&#13;
6.13 The possibility that informal/artisanal truckers could be hired by expanding larger&#13;
operators is a strong possibility. This was recognized and welcomed by some small truckers&#13;
and confirmed by larger operators. Wages as an employee in a larger and more professional&#13;
operation would likely exceed income earned as a small informal operator and this transition&#13;
would thus be positive from a poverty perspective.&#13;
&#13;
       Potential Mitigation Measures&#13;
&#13;
6.14 Phasing and sequencing of reforms: First, given that a number of those unable to&#13;
transition to a more modern and professional environment tend to be older operators, it may be&#13;
useful to phase in some requirements or provide â&#128;&#156;grandfatherâ&#128;? clauses to permit a logical&#13;
phasing-out period and to permit natural attrition to take its course. Second, some adjustment&#13;
will be required even among those willing and able to modernize. Appropriate timing and&#13;
sequencing of reforms could facilitate and allow for a more gradual, less disruptive and more&#13;
inclusive adjustment period.&#13;
&#13;
6.15 Re-group into groupement dâ&#128;&#153;intÃ©rÃªts Ã©conomiques (GIE): Small and artisanal&#13;
operators can organize themselves into cooperatives to attain economies of scale -- potentially&#13;
enabling them to share costs and assets as a means to attain a degree of professionalization.&#13;
Several small operators expressed an interest in this avenue and some were planning such efforts.&#13;
&#13;
6.16 Partnership with big operators: Small, informal, and artisanal operators could&#13;
potentially partner with big, formal operators, including through the sale of their trucks.&#13;
Supporting measures may be necessary to organize and bring them together with potentially&#13;
interested big operators, but this was noted as a possibility.&#13;
&#13;
6.17 Transition to other activities: If unable to professionalize, small/informal operators can&#13;
transition to other activities based on their existing skill levels or asset endowment. For&#13;
example, some have indicated the possibility of transitioning to passenger transport, which is less&#13;
cumbersome in terms of investment requirements relative to the trucking business. Others could&#13;
transition to trade in merchandise related to the trucking business such as sale of truck tires,&#13;
vehicle oil and lubricants, etc.&#13;
&#13;
6.18 Supporting policy measures: As part of the reform process, operators intending to&#13;
transition to other activities could benefit from supporting policy measures such as access to&#13;
finance as well as training opportunities to transition to other activities. Training opportunities&#13;
were noted as being very important, in particular for the small operators considering the fact that&#13;
almost all the chauffeurs are illiterate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                51&#13;
&amp;#12;6.19 Scrappage schemes: Measures to facilitate the removal of old, unreliable, unsafe, costly&#13;
and polluting trucks, including the payment of scrappage fees, could enable not only the&#13;
transformation and compliance of truckers wanting to professionalize and modernize, but also&#13;
could facilitate the movement of those truckers incapable or unwilling to modernize into other&#13;
activities. As truck numbers are expected to fall, at least initially, appropriately designed&#13;
mechanisms that provide incentives to scrap old trucks could be useful in modernizing the road&#13;
transport sector and also in providing resources for those wanting to transition to other activities.&#13;
Participation in scrappage schemes could also help identify those truckers leaving the sector and&#13;
thus facilitate their access to and participation in other programs, such as re-training programs,&#13;
that could further accommodate their transition.&#13;
&#13;
       Coxeurs&#13;
&#13;
6.20 Should the freight exchange system become operational and fully fulfill its function,&#13;
coxeurs would be expected in all likelihood to be largely out of business. Given the informal&#13;
nature of their activity in the freight transport business, it is difficult to ascertain how many are&#13;
engaged in intermediating between shippers and transporters. However, it is evident that they&#13;
are significant in number and that they play an important, though at times distortionary and&#13;
predatory, role in the absence of a professionalized system of freight transport and modern&#13;
freight allocation mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
6.21 The majority of coxeurs have little education, many are functionally illiterate, with&#13;
seemingly limited possibility to transition to other activities. Therefore, the likely negative&#13;
impact on those who solely rely on this activity will be significant. Nonetheless there was some&#13;
ambiguity here, as several coxeurs interviewed in both CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso indicated&#13;
interest in and the possibility of converting/transitioning to other activities, such as agriculture or&#13;
trade-related activities. Many appeared well-versed in transport industry operations and&#13;
expressed an interest in occupying other roles within the transport industry. Several indicated&#13;
the possibility of playing a complementary role to the freight exchange system since they already&#13;
have a roster of clients with whom they work â&#128;&#147; or otherwise have some contractual relationships.&#13;
They believe that they can work as representatives of shippers to bring business to trucking&#13;
companies.&#13;
&#13;
6.22 Despite improved freight allocation measures and the existence of a freight&#13;
exchange, virtual or otherwise, there was a general impression across industry participants&#13;
that the services of coxeurs, or similar intermediaries will be required, even if only to assist&#13;
in helping truckers and transporters initially navigate the new environment. While this&#13;
need may dissipate over time, it seems reasonable to assume that the need for coxeur-like&#13;
services will continue over the foreseeable future though at reduced levels.&#13;
&#13;
6.23 Many positive suggestions by industry participants seemed to indicate that coxeurs&#13;
could remain engaged in a fully professionalized freight transport business . However,&#13;
further consultation with all actors, including coxeurs, were noted as necessary to ensure&#13;
provision of required training, say in operation and functioning of the virtual freight exchange, as&#13;
well as public sensitization.&#13;
&#13;
       Potential Mitigation Measures:&#13;
&#13;
                                                  52&#13;
&amp;#12;6.24 Transition to other activities: Facilitation support may enable them to mitigate&#13;
negative impacts in both the medium- to long-term. Some coxeurs interviewed in both CÃ´te&#13;
dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso indicated the possibility of transitioning to other activities such as&#13;
agriculture or trade-related activities. Facilitation support may enable them to mitigate negative&#13;
impacts in both the medium- to long-term.&#13;
6.25 Participation in the transport business: Some coxeurs have indicated a willingness to&#13;
participate in the professionalized freight transport system since they are familiar with the&#13;
business. However, they would need to gain access to financing as well as further training to&#13;
adhere to the new standards of the business.&#13;
&#13;
6.26 Continued provision of brokerage services: Suggestions were made to make a&#13;
concerted effort to identify those coxeurs who would like to remain engaged in a&#13;
professionalized trucking business and provide them with a fixed commission as well as training&#13;
so that they could complement the freight exchange system. Whereas the freight exchange&#13;
system is envisaged to function virtually, some truckers believe that the coxeurs could play a&#13;
facilitation role of verification on site.&#13;
&#13;
Reform Area #2: Modernizing/Renewing fleets&#13;
&#13;
6.27 By the time a potential RDPO-3 comes into effect, the institutional framework for&#13;
technical inspection of commercial trucks will have been adopted in both Burkina Faso and CÃ´te&#13;
dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire. This implies an expectation that truckers will have modernized their fleets and&#13;
consequences and sanctions for non-compliant vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
6.28 Stakeholders expected to be affected positively include those bigger operators with the&#13;
means or ease of access to financing to renew their trucking fleets. In particular, Ivorian&#13;
operators18 that stand to benefit from potential accompanying measures to facilitate their access&#13;
to finance19 as well as operators in Burkina Faso, who stand to benefit from their governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
policy of support for fleet renewal through tax incentives and exemptions from customs duties on&#13;
trucks.20 Smaller, currently informal operators who have the capacity and desire to&#13;
professionalize and modernize through the purchase of a new truck(s) could also benefit.&#13;
Smaller operators wanting to renew their fleet will be highly dependent on accompanying&#13;
measures to facilitate the purchase or leasing of new vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
6.29 Stakeholders affected negatively will include small and individual truckers that are not&#13;
able to renew their fleets, despite anticipated policy incentives and supporting measures. There&#13;
may be a myriad of reasons for an inability to purchase or lease new trucks, but this could&#13;
include: demanding collateral requirements; inappropriate amortization periods; high cost of new&#13;
trucks; perceived limited management capacity; and a lack of professionalization among some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
   Currently, the Ivorian fleet is decimated to such an extent that CI cannot even meet the minimum requirements of&#13;
one-third of transit traffic to which it is entitled under bilateral agreements with BF.&#13;
19&#13;
   A law was voted in 2012 that exempted buyers of trucks in CI from 18% tax on new trucks, which resulted in an&#13;
upsurge of new truck imports (PEA study).&#13;
20&#13;
   Toward the end of 2013, the government of Burkina Faso facilitated fleet renewal for 400 new trucks and 200 oil&#13;
trucks through tax incentives (PEA study).&#13;
&#13;
                                                        53&#13;
&amp;#12;small truckers and their inability to adequately present loan proposals or be considered for&#13;
loans/leases.&#13;
&#13;
6.30 Focus group discussions as well as individual informant interviews with a wide&#13;
cross-section of truckers (both small and large operators) indicate a strong willingness to&#13;
take advantage of potential fleet renewal accompanying measures â&#128;&#147; in particular access to&#13;
financing schemes. If the supporting policy and accompanying measures are well coordinated&#13;
between the relevant authorities in both countries, the expectation among the trucking&#13;
community is that there will be a lot of positive benefits for the truckers, banks, insurance&#13;
companies, drivers, trainees, and other industry actors, including coxeurs (provided they are&#13;
given a role as described above).&#13;
&#13;
6.31 However, all actors have indicated the need to enforce all the reform areas to ensure&#13;
that there remain no disincentives for fleet renewal. Should the planned reform measures not&#13;
be fully implemented or adequately enforced, and should this permit the continued operation of&#13;
non-complying trucks, continued over-loading and an otherwise continuation of the status quo,&#13;
all recognize that the benefits would be seriously diminished.&#13;
&#13;
6.32 A number of small as well as large operators indicated that they were not aware of&#13;
any supporting policy and accompanying measures that could enable and facilitate fleet&#13;
renewal. Others remarked during focus group discussions that despite a strong willingness by a&#13;
majority of small operators to modernize their fleets, many were suspicious of potential&#13;
supporting measures given past experience in dealing with unaccommodating policies from the&#13;
banks themselves. This suggests the need for proper awareness campaigns backed by a targeted&#13;
communication strategy.&#13;
&#13;
       Potential Mitigation Measures&#13;
&#13;
6.33 It was suggested that organizing small operators together into cooperatives (GIE)&#13;
could enable them to achieve greater influence and access with the banking and financial&#13;
community.&#13;
&#13;
6.34 Accompanying measures, particularly measures to facilitate access to finance, will&#13;
have to be appropriately structured so as to facilitate access from across the spectrum of&#13;
truckers and companies, from large to small and from formal to informal. This will have to&#13;
include a careful determination of collateral requirements, interest charges, amortization periods,&#13;
down payment requirements, etc. In a more modern, more professional and more technically&#13;
demanding environment, the inability to access vehicles that can comply and remain compliant&#13;
with increasingly demanding standards will pose a serious barrier to entry and/or ongoing&#13;
participation in the industry.&#13;
&#13;
6.35 As noted previously, well-designed scrappage schemes could meaningfully contribute&#13;
to both fleet renewal efforts and in the provision of financial resources to those truckers&#13;
leaving the industry.&#13;
&#13;
Reform Area #3: Reduce roadblocks and improve control operations on the corridor&#13;
&#13;
                                                54&#13;
&amp;#12;6.36 There are 31 mobile and fixed checkpoints between Abidjan and Ouagadougou&#13;
(UEMOA/West Africa Trade Hub 2013). In both CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Burkina Faso, the reduction&#13;
of roadblocks and improved control operations on the transport corridor will likely have net&#13;
positive impacts as noted in previous sections.&#13;
&#13;
6.37 Stakeholders affected positively will include highly compliant operators, typically large&#13;
operators and shippers, who will benefit from streamlined and faster service and quicker turn-&#13;
around times.&#13;
&#13;
6.38 Stakeholders affected negatively will clearly be currently non-compliant operators who&#13;
do not wish to or are not capable of becoming compliant. This would typically, though not&#13;
exclusively, be small individual operators who may otherwise benefit from lax enforcement of&#13;
transport sector legal and regulatory controls.&#13;
&#13;
6.39 It was noted in the focus group discussions that the excessive number of roadblocks&#13;
and inefficient control operations cause traffic delays and expose truck operators to&#13;
extortion. In addition to the direct costs incurred in paying bribes, this time lost on the&#13;
roadblocks renders the Abidjan-Ouagadougou transport corridor highly costly, resulting in the&#13;
diversion of traffic to nearby countries â&#128;&#147; including Togo, Ghana, and Dakar. Indeed, Togo has&#13;
eliminated almost all roadblocks entirely and is quickly becoming recognized as a more efficient&#13;
and less costly corridor as a result.&#13;
&#13;
6.40 The reduction of roadblocks and more efficient and effective control operations will&#13;
also likely lead to increased traffic and merchandise trade. This should, in turn, provide more&#13;
business opportunities for truck operators, the Port Autonome dâ&#128;&#153;Abidjan;21 as well as for direct&#13;
and indirectly related employment opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
        Potential Mitigation Measures&#13;
&#13;
6.41 When fully implemented, the benefits will be largely positive for all compliant&#13;
operators. Mitigation measures for operators negatively impacted should typically include&#13;
helping them to achieve professionalization as have been previously noted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reform Area #4: Improve Port Operational efficiency and reduce gateway and terminal&#13;
prices&#13;
&#13;
6.42 The AOC is characterized by high cargo handling prices and port charges in&#13;
Abidjan. In addition, the monopolistic nature of the freight delivery business in the Abidjan&#13;
metropolitan area, coupled with an oligopolistic organization of handling companies, results in&#13;
high terminal prices. As indicated by previous studies, the de facto monopoly in freight&#13;
allocation in the Abidjan metropolitan area may stem from the poor quality, insecure and&#13;
&#13;
21&#13;
  According to some transport syndicates in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, this would potentially mean the return of importers from&#13;
Mali and Burkina Faso who attempt to circumvent the problems associated with cumbersome system of roadblocks&#13;
and control systems.&#13;
&#13;
                                                        55&#13;
&amp;#12;unreliable nature of available transport services and the risk of losing containers, i.e., from the&#13;
desire of the terminal operator to deal only with known and trusted transporters. As a result,&#13;
curbing the monopoly for local deliveries in the Abidjan metropolitan area will impact those&#13;
truckers, handlers, shippers and their employees that currently benefit from this monopoly.&#13;
&#13;
6.43 This reform area is expected to have an overall net positive benefit to most actors in&#13;
the trucking business, in particular among all compliant operators who will benefit from&#13;
increased business opportunities. It is estimated that some 650,000 containers will become&#13;
available annually for delivery in the Abidjan metropolitan area.&#13;
&#13;
6.44 In addition, the reduction in the port prices will likely incentivize importers from&#13;
Mali and Burkina Faso to frequent the AOC corridor in lieu of alternative routes (in&#13;
particular, from Dakar), thereby creating more business opportunities for all actors involved in&#13;
transport services along this corridor. To enhance this likely positive effect and accommodate&#13;
the resulting influx of traffic, a coordinated streamlining of customs and port authority&#13;
procedures would be necessary to avoid delays and traffic congestion.&#13;
&#13;
6.45 A more competitive trucking business in the Abidjan metropolitan area will likely&#13;
create more opportunities for all stakeholders in the medium- to long-term, although the&#13;
curbing of monopolies may initially cause some negative impact on those shippers, handlers,&#13;
truckers, and their employees currently benefiting from monopoly power. In addition, potential&#13;
negative effects will be offset by gains for those currently not permitted access and should also&#13;
result in significant welfare gains, to both consumers and producers, overall.&#13;
&#13;
6.46 Stakeholders affected positively will be large operators and shippers that will benefit&#13;
from a reduction in gateway and terminal prices. In addition, all compliant operators will benefit&#13;
from increased business opportunities as the monopoly is more or less dismantled.&#13;
&#13;
6.47 Stakeholders that will be affected negatively, as noted, will be those shippers, handlers,&#13;
truckers, and their employees currently benefiting from monopoly power.&#13;
&#13;
       Potential Mitigation Measures&#13;
&#13;
6.48 Mitigation measures for operators affected negatively by this reform area are largely in&#13;
line with supporting measure outlined in other reform areas, namely supporting them to&#13;
professionalize or participate in related activities.&#13;
&#13;
       Reform Area #5: Promote Containerization&#13;
&#13;
6.49 A number of current jobs in the port of Abidjan are dependent on the inefficient&#13;
practice of unloading containers and re-packing their contents into trucks. It is estimated&#13;
that of the 55,000 containers imported into Ouagadougou, only 22 % come through CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire&#13;
and only 10-20% are containerized.&#13;
&#13;
6.50 Containerization will require truck operators to adapt their trucking fleets to be&#13;
able to accommodate containers. This may be difficult for some small operators that may not&#13;
&#13;
                                                56&#13;
&amp;#12;have access to financial resources with which to modify their fleets (these issues are similar to&#13;
those related to fleet renewal in reform area #2). While large operators in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire seem to&#13;
be ready to transport containerized cargo to Burkina Faso, some small operators indicate that this&#13;
reform area may have a negative impact given their inability to modify their fleets.&#13;
&#13;
6.51 The most significant negative impact will be among dockers who are engaged in the&#13;
unloading, stripping, and re-packing containers. Although it is difficult to ascertain how&#13;
many would be directly affected, these dockers are likely to be relatively low-skilled, illiterate&#13;
and hence have limited capacity to be absorbed into other trades.&#13;
&#13;
6.52 Stakeholders affected positively will include: 1. shippers and large trucking operators&#13;
who will benefit from more efficient inland logistics; and 2. smaller operators who could also&#13;
benefit from improved efficiency, particularly from faster turn-around times, fewer delays in&#13;
loading and unloading, as well as from improved access to shipments.&#13;
&#13;
6.53 Stakeholders affected negatively will largely be those individuals engaged in stripping&#13;
and re-packing of transit containers at the ports in CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire as this practice will to a large&#13;
extent be significantly reduced, though probably not entirely eliminated. In addition, small&#13;
operators unable to upgrade or modify their fleets so that they can transport containerized freight&#13;
could also be negatively affected.&#13;
&#13;
       Potential Mitigation Measures&#13;
&#13;
6.54 Provide training for transition to other activities:                   Given that when fully&#13;
professionalized, the industry is likely to create job opportunities in industries related to the&#13;
trucking business itself as transport services respond to increased demand, some specialized&#13;
training could be provided to dockers/stevedores to allow for a transition into other activities.&#13;
However, training need not be limited to industries related to the trucking business and it could&#13;
include training in other trade-related activities, or basic skills upgrading, among others.&#13;
&#13;
Reform Area #6: Improve road conditions and reduce infrastructure maintenance costs&#13;
through enforcement of axle load regulations&#13;
&#13;
6.55 As noted, there is a general problem of overloading in the Abidjan-Ouagadougou&#13;
corridor, which incurs high road maintenance and vehicle operating costs. By reducing&#13;
these costs, this reform will have large positive net economic benefits over the medium- and&#13;
long-term. However, the enforcement of the reform areas may have immediate impact across&#13;
all operators, both small and large.&#13;
&#13;
6.56 Ex-ante one would expect that axle-load controls may affect smaller operators more&#13;
than larger operators as they may have a greater incentive to overload their fleet in order to&#13;
maximize revenue per trip. However, reaction to the policy reform measures was mixed among&#13;
all trucker groups as some, both small and large operators, would prefer not to overload while&#13;
others feel the practice is necessary. There is some fear that axle load enforcement may lead to&#13;
greater opportunities for corruption and rent seeking, a burden that my fall more heavily on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                57&#13;
&amp;#12;small, informal, and already less-compliant operators, i.e., those less able to overcome such&#13;
obstacles.&#13;
&#13;
6.57 As mentioned earlier, overloading is largely a function of the need to maximize&#13;
revenues per trip rather than over a period of time, which can be achieved through frequent&#13;
trips by newer and more efficient trucks, and is thus related to issues of fleet renewal.&#13;
&#13;
6.58 Stakeholders affected positively will include all complaint operators, both large and&#13;
small, who will benefit from improved road infrastructure, leading to a reduction in maintenance&#13;
costs, faster trip times, and potentially an increase in average mileage per truck.&#13;
&#13;
6.59 Stakeholders affected negatively, at least over the short-term, will be truckers who&#13;
decide to continue to practice over-loading, particularly single-truck and small operators along&#13;
with their employees.&#13;
&#13;
       Potential Mitigation Measures&#13;
&#13;
6.60 Re-group into groupement dâ&#128;&#153;intÃ©rÃªts Ã©conomiques (GIE): As in other areas, small&#13;
and artisanal operators could organize themselves into cooperatives to attain economies of scale -&#13;
- potentially enabling them to share costs to achieve a greater degree of professionalization in&#13;
order to be able to access financing for fleet renewal upon which this reform area depends.&#13;
&#13;
6.61 Supporting policy measures: As part of the reform process, operators intending to&#13;
comply with the reform areas could benefit from supporting policy measures such as access to&#13;
finance as well as training opportunities. Training opportunities could also be twinned with&#13;
proper communication strategies â&#128;&#147; as the specific reform areas are not yet well known by some&#13;
actors.&#13;
