latest measure at press time. As of August 2008, the World Bank was in the process of revising poverty estimates using more recent PPP conversion&#13;
factors that are based on the 2005 round of the International Comparison Program.&#13;

REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, AND STAFF&#13;
&#13;
To recruit and retain highly qualified staff, the World Bank Group has developed a compensation and benefits system designed&#13;
to be internationally competitive, to reward performance, and to take into account the special needs of a multinational and&#13;
largely expatriate staff. The Bank Group's staff salary structure is reviewed annually by the Executive Directors and, if war-&#13;
ranted, is adjusted on the basis of a comparison with salaries paid by private financial and industrial firms and by representative&#13;
public sector agencies in the U.S. market. After analyses of updated comparator salaries, the Board approved an average&#13;
increase in the salary structure of 3.5 percent for fiscal 2008, effective July 1, 2007, for Washington-appointed staff.&#13;
     The annual salaries (net of taxes) of executive management of the World Bank Group were as follows for the period July 1,&#13;
2007, through June 30, 2008:&#13;

    Although the decline in world poverty is a positive sign,&#13;
poverty reduction has been highly uneven across regions.&#13;
In East Asia the goal of halving extreme poverty has already&#13;
been achieved: the percentage of people living on $1 a day&#13;
is expected to drop to 2 percent (although the percentage of&#13;
people living on $2 a day will account for a still significant&#13;
15 percent). At the other extreme is Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
Despite a 4.7 percentage point decline in the share of people&#13;
living in extreme poverty between 1999 and 2004, some&#13;
31 percent of Africa's population will still be living on less&#13;
than$1adayby2015--higherthantheMDGtargetof23per-&#13;
cent. There are some exceptions, however; countries such&#13;
as Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda are making&#13;
solid progress toward the MDGs.&#13;
    The recent increase in food prices may set back recent&#13;
gains in reducing poverty. Preliminary estimates from the&#13;
World Bank indicate that the persistence of current food&#13;
prices may well translate into losing almost seven years of&#13;
progress in poverty reduction, with up to 105 million people in&#13;
low-income countries pushed into poverty over the next three&#13;

Authority on Development HIV/AIDS Partnership Program&#13;
Support Project, the Regional HIV/AIDS Treatment&#13;

new agenda for action in preventing and dealing with the&#13;
consequences of HIV/AIDS through 2011 (see http://www&#13;

emissions and is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate&#13;
change, the Bank is working on many fronts. A climate&#13;
change and disaster risk management strategy is being&#13;
developed for Papua New Guinea, and, with support from the&#13;
Global Environment Facility and the Global Fund for Disaster&#13;
Relief and Rehabilitation, the Bank is helping six Pacific&#13;
Island countries to draw up plans for adapting to potential&#13;
impacts from climate change. In China, five major carbon-&#13;
trade agreements are bringing financial resources to support&#13;
the introduction of cleaner technology in the steel sector,&#13;
innovations in biogas reduction from agriculture, and broader&#13;
use of lower-carbon liquefied natural gas. At the same time,&#13;
the Bank is working with China to reduce greenhouse&#13;
emissions by improving energy efficiency, restoring forests,&#13;
and investing in renewable sources of energy. In Indonesia,&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Bank Group's work focuses
            on achievement of the eight Millennium Development Goals
            (MDGs). The goals call for eliminating poverty and achieving
            inclusive and sustainable globalization. The MDGs lay out a
            blueprint for the World Bank Group, setting its priorities
            and measuring its results. The World Bank is the
            world's largest funder of education; the world's
            largest external funder of the fight against HIV/AIDS; a
            leader in the fight against corruption worldwide; a strong
            supporter of debt relief; and the largest international
            financier of biodiversity, water supply, and sanitation
            projects. The recipients of the World Bank Group's
            fiscal 2008 financial commitments are using the funds in
            more than 670 projects, many of them collaborative efforts
            of two or more of the affiliates. The projects are designed
            to overcome poverty and enhance growth by improving
            education and health services, promoting private sector
            development, building infrastructure, and strengthening
            governance and institutions. They are practical plans to
            help developing countries move from poverty and become more
            competitive in a globalizing world. The Bank Group is also
            preparing a strategic framework on climate change and
            development - a plan for integrating climate change and
            development challenges without compromising growth and
            poverty reduction efforts. The framework will include
            priorities, approaches, and a road map for action in helping
            countries mitigate or adapt to climate change. In addition,
            the Bank Group has set a goal of scaling up its portfolio of
            investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency
            projects by an annual average of 20 percent through 2010.
