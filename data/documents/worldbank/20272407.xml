S  tructural impediments slowed economic expansion to near stagnation even before the impact of&#13;
   increased policy uncertainty amid heightened geopolitical tensions took hold. GDP growth was just&#13;
0.8 percent in the first half of 2014 compared to 0.9 percent in the first half of 2013. The reasons for&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s slowdown remain on balance of structural nature, with the economy operating at close to its&#13;
potential output level. Although Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s growth was not dissimilar to that of the Euro Zone, it dipped&#13;
under that of other country comparator groups, such as emerging and high-income economies. Due&#13;
to Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s integration into the world economy with the exports of resource-intensive products to high-&#13;
income countries, their growth paths remain closely entwined. Current geopolitical tensions are adversely&#13;
impacting these trade relationships.&#13;

1.1 Growth - An Economy on the Threshold of Recession&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s growth stagnated in the first half of the year and lingers near the threshold of a recession.&#13;
Growth is negatively impacted by low business and consumer confidence in an environment in which&#13;
heightened geopolitical tensions and sanctions generate increased policy uncertainty.&#13;

&#13;
R   ussiaâ&#128;&#153;s low-level growth is not that dissimilar&#13;
    to that in the Euro zone, but it contrasts with&#13;
the cautiously firming growth in other high-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    Box 1               Recent global trends&#13;
    Global growth and trade picked up in the second quarter of 2014 after a weak start of the year (Figure 4). The second&#13;
    quarter rebound was largely driven by strengthening growth in the US, where the economy grew faster than expected,&#13;
    accelerating to 4.2 percent (q-o-q, saar) after a weather-related 2.1 percent contraction in the first quarter. In the Euro area,&#13;
    second quarter GDP growth disappointed at 0.2 percent (after 1.1 percent in quarter one) and saw Germany contracting 0.2&#13;
    percent from 0.8 percent growth in the first quarter. In Japan, GDP growth contracted by 6.8 percent in the second quarter,&#13;
    as a result of the 3-percentage-point sales tax hike in April, offsetting 6.1 percent first quarter growth. In Japan, GDP growth&#13;
    contracted by 6.8 percent in the second quarter, as a result of the 3-percentage-point sales tax hike in April, offsetting strong&#13;
    first quarter growth (6.1 percent). Accommodative monetary policies and firming import demand in high-income countries&#13;
    have supported growth and capital inflows in developing countries. Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s second-quarter GDP growth was steady at 7.5&#13;
    percent (y-o-y) supported by a rebound in exports and earlier stimulus measures. Global trade reported a healthy pick-up in&#13;
    the first half of 2014: in the three months to June it increased by 4.2 percent.&#13;
&#13;
    Gross capital flows to developing countries have remained strong since March, notwithstanding the ongoing US Fed&#13;
    tapering. Additional easing by the European Central Bank, combined with prospects of modest growth and stable inflation&#13;
    in the United States, helped depress bond yields and volatility worldwide (Figure 5). Despite geopolitical concerns in Israel,&#13;
    Syria, Ukraine and Iraq, spreads on emerging market bonds have narrowed more than 100 basis points since early February.&#13;
    The escalation of tensions in Ukraine and the payment default of Argentina pushed up Credit Default Swaps spreads for&#13;
    sovereign bonds of these countries, but the impact on other emerging economies has so far been muted.&#13;
&#13;
    Oil prices were remarkably stable through mid-year despite rising geopolitical tensions (Figure 6). Prices exceeded US$108/&#13;
    bbl in June due to geopolitical concerns in Iraq, but retreated to a 12-month low under US$100/bbl in August and September.&#13;
    Apart from the June surge, oil prices have been stable and the rising geopolitical tensions seem to have not affected the&#13;
    global oil markets significantly. Oil production from Iraqâ&#128;&#153;s Kurdistan autonomous region doubled in August and is expected&#13;
    to increase further by the end of 2014. OECD inventories rebounded from the past decadeâ&#128;&#153;s lowest level in December 2013,&#13;
    reaching 2,685 million bbl in June. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Russia will remain the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest&#13;
    crude oil supplier, with production expected to be marginally up from 10.88 mb/d in 2013 (Figure 7). However, Russia is&#13;
    advancing its strategy of recent years to divert its crude oil exports to Asian markets. During January-July 2014, those exports&#13;
    were up 27 percent compared to a year ago while deliveries to Europe declined by 10 percent during this period.&#13;

&#13;
  Box 2       Sanctions and their impact on markets and the economy&#13;
  Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine tensions, and up to September 17 when this report went to press, Russia has been&#13;
  subject to several rounds of sanctions from developed economies. First, there were sanctions introduced by the US,&#13;
  EU, and other countries aimed at specific individuals, groups and companies. They prohibit the entry of the sanctioned&#13;
  individuals, freeze their assets and ban business operations with these individuals and companies. Such sanctions were&#13;
  introduced by the US, EU, Canada, Australia, Albania, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Norway, New Zealand, Ukraine,&#13;
  Switzerland, Montenegro, and Japan. Second, sanctions aiming at Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s military, energy and financial sectors were&#13;
  introduced. In the financial sector, access of the Russian six major state banks to the EU and US financial markets was&#13;
  severely limited. Since September 12, these companies can only apply for loans and issue debt not exceeding 30 days&#13;
  maturity. In the defense sector, the US and the EU cut access to financing exceeding 30 days maturity for Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s major&#13;
  companies and introduced an export ban for dual-use goods and technology for 14 mixed-defense companies. Sanctions&#13;
  on cooperation with Russia in the military sector were introduced by Great Britain, Israel, Switzerland, and Sweden. In&#13;
  the energy sector, the US and the EU limited access to finance for Russian major oil and gas companies. Also the EU and&#13;
  the US prohibited export of goods, services (not including financial services), or technology in support of exploration&#13;
  or production for Russian deep-water, Arctic offshore, or shale projects. Norway, Canada, and Australia largely joined&#13;
  sanctions introduced by the EU. Sanctions were also introduced against Crimea and Sevastopol, including a ban on&#13;
  investment projects and mineral extraction and a trade ban on a wide range of goods (by the EU and Norway). On August&#13;
  7, Russia banned the import of meat, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit, milk, dairy products, and a wide range of processed&#13;
  foods from the US, the EU, Australia, Canada, and Norway for a year in response to their sanctions.&#13;
&#13;
  Sanctions and counter sanctions hit the economy through three channels. First, they led to increased volatility on the&#13;
  foreign exchange market and a significant depreciation of the national currency (Figure 8 and Figure 9). Massive capital&#13;
  outflows triggered by the tensions led to a deterioration of the capital and financial account balance and a decrease in net&#13;
  international reserves. Yet, despite the depreciation, non-oil exports did not increase much, and although there was a small&#13;
  impulse to import substitution, its potential appear to be limited, given that there is little spare capacity due to structural&#13;
  constraints. Depreciation also exerted additional pressure on inflation. In response to high inflation pressures, the Central&#13;
  Bank significantly tightened monetary conditions. The policy appears consistent with its long-term inflation target, yet it&#13;
  increased domestic borrowing rates and further restricted access to domestic credit for investors and consumers. Second,&#13;
  the tensions also limited Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s access to international financial markets, with markets pricing Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s higher risk into the&#13;
  cost of credit and sending sovereign Credit Default Swap spreads for Russia soaring. Foreign borrowing decreased in the&#13;
  first half of 2014. These tighter domestic and external credit conditions are likely to have negatively affected investment&#13;
  and consumption decisions, leading to a delay or a scaling back of respective plans. Finally,already low domestic business&#13;
  and consumer confidence in future growth prospects continued to diminish and reduce consumption and investment&#13;
  activities. We expect that these trends will worsen during the second half of 2014 and throughout 2015, when the impact&#13;
  of the additional sanctions will be felt, leading to a period of stagnation. We expect that these trends will worsen during&#13;
  the second half of 2014 and throughout 2015, when the impact of the additional sanctions will be felt, leading to a period&#13;
  of stagnation (see section 2).&#13;

    Growth in the non-tradable sectorâ&#128;&#149;the main growth driver in recent yearsâ&#128;&#149;moderated to a lower level (Figure 10).&#13;
    Consumer demand for non-tradable market services is increasingly constrained by slowing income growth, high inflation&#13;
    and rising household debt burden, which was in particular reflected in the slowdown in retail and wholesale trade. Negative&#13;
    investment growth is reflected in continued contraction in the construction sector. However, in the tradable sector, the&#13;
    Ruble depreciation appears to have helped to revive economic activities in the manufacturing sector, which reported&#13;
    an acceleration of output (Figure 11). Activities in other tradable sectors such as agriculture and mineral extraction&#13;
    improved marginally in the second quarter relative to the first quarter of 2014. There was some positive impulse to a few&#13;
    manufacturing sub-sectors from import substitution, which appears to be carried over into the third quarter. As a result,&#13;
    the rate of capacity utilization increased back to 2012 levels when the recent economic slowdown began. With capacity&#13;
    utilization approaching historical highs and a continuously tight labor market (see section 1.2) the positive effect of import&#13;
    substitution might be short-lived and limited by structural constraints (Box 9 in part 2).&#13;

1.2 Labor Market â&#128;&#147; Still In A Tight Spot&#13;
The economic stagnation has been accompanied by employment at near maximum historical levels&#13;
and low unemployment. Some increase in labor mobility between sectors helped reallocate scarce&#13;
labor resources. Growth in wage and transfers slowed during the first half of 2014 and negatively&#13;
impacting real disposable-income growth.&#13;

    Box 4            Recent productivity trends&#13;
    Real wages grew in line with productivity for the economy as a whole. In the first half of 2014, productivity growth was&#13;
    higher in the tradable sector than in non-tradable sectors (Figure 14). Nonetheless, favorable wage dynamics in the private&#13;
    non-tradable sector led to some improvement in the productivity gap (Figure 15). Developments in the manufacturing&#13;
    sector were more volatile than in other industries however, with productivity growth lagging wage growth in the first&#13;
    quarter before a sharp reversal in the second.&#13;

1.3 Monetary Policy and The Financial Sector â&#128;&#147; The Elusive Inflation Target&#13;
The geopolitical tensions led to increased volatility on the foreign exchange market and a significant&#13;
depreciation of the Ruble. In response to persistently high inflation pressures, the CBR significantly&#13;
tightened monetary policy. The financial sector is becoming increasingly affected by the geopolitical&#13;
tensions and related sanctions, which is eroding the depositorsâ&#128;&#153; base and limiting access to credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D    uring the first half of 2014, the exchange&#13;
     rate went through three episodes of high&#13;
volatility, leading the Central Bank to scale up&#13;
                                                                           basis points to 7.0 percent, while purchases for&#13;
                                                                           the Reserve Fund were immediately put on hold&#13;
                                                                           (Figure 18). In addition, the CBR strengthened its&#13;
its interventions significantly. First, pressure on                        intervention rule.2 Although some confidence into&#13;
the Ruble increased in January 2014 as a result                            the Ruble was restored, the CBR had to continue&#13;
of uncertainty around the impact of the US Fed                             intervening and spent close to US$25 billion in&#13;
tapering of its quantitative easing policies and                           March alone to support the Ruble. Pressure on the&#13;
speculation around CBRâ&#128;&#153;s move to a more flexible                           Ruble decreased substantially in April and May,&#13;
exchange rate regime. To support the Ruble, the                            reflecting the temporary easing of geopolitical&#13;
Central Bank more than doubled the amount                                  tensions. Consequently, the CBR discontinued&#13;
of intervention to US$8.6 billion compared to                              interventions on May 12 and relaxed the rules&#13;
December 2013, and it continued intervening                                for its foreign exchange interventions in late&#13;
in February (US$6.4 billion). On March 3, the                              May and again in June.3,4 However, at the end of&#13;
exchange rate entered a second period of increased                         July, the exchange rate entered its third round of&#13;
volatility due to the start of the Russia-Ukraine                          high volatility this year on the back of renewed&#13;
tensions. CBR hiked its main policy rates by 150                           Russia-Ukraine tensions. Yet, CBR refrained from&#13;

  	 On March 3, CBR raised the amount of cumulative interventions sufficient for moving the foreign exchange corridor by 5 kopecks from US$350&#13;
    million to US$1.5 billion, moving the currency corridor up by 35 kopecks, and intervened in the amount of US$11.3 billion which is close to the&#13;
    historical maximum of US$15 billion on January 19, 2009. CBR officially announced these changes to its exchange rate policy as temporary&#13;
    and confirmed their intention to move to a flexible exchange rate regime by 2015.&#13;

  	 On May 22, the CBR changed the rules of its foreign exchange interventions: the amount of its interventions was lowered from US$200 million&#13;
    to US$100 million when the Ruble is traded in the range of 1.5â&#128;&#147;2.5 Rubles from the center of the CBR band. In addition, it lowered the amount&#13;
    of its support from US$400 million to US$300 million when the Ruble is traded 0.95 Ruble apart from the edges of the CBR band. CBR kept its&#13;
    temporary March measure of moving the foreign exchange corridor by 5 kopecks for cumulative interventions of US$1.5 billion. The regulator&#13;
    only conducted purchases of currency for replenishment of the Reserve Fund (US$1.5 billion in June). Purchases were suspended on June 24,&#13;
    when the total amount of purchases for the Reserve Fund this year reached US$5.7 billion, close to the initially planned amount of about&#13;
    US$6.1 billion.&#13;

    On June 17, CBR moved the operational band that does not require its interference from 3.1 to 5.1 rubles, reducing the amount of interventions&#13;
    in the zone 0.95 Ruble apart from the edges of the Ruble band from US$300 million to US$200 million. Also, CBR lowered the cumulative&#13;
    amount of interventions required for shifting of the Ruble band by 5 kopecks to US$1.0 billion from US$1.5 billion.&#13;

 Box 6           The link between capital flight and FDI&#13;
 FDI performance in Russia was in the past closely intertwined with capital outflows. Historically, investors sought to&#13;
 avoid adverse features of the Russian investment climate by relocating investments offshore and engaging in round-tripping&#13;
 (Fabry and Zeghini, 2002), but off-shoring for tax reasons is also likely. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s FDI contains a large share of inbound FDI&#13;
 reported as originating from Cyprus and other countries, which is likely to be round-tripping FDI of Russian origin or, in other&#13;
 words,repatriated capital which was previously observed as capital outflows from Russia. However, round-tripping FDI of&#13;
 domestic firms that might earn additional rents from the fact that they are able to obtain tax advantages is less likely to carry&#13;
 with it benefits of growth-enhancing effects, such as technology and other productivity improving practices, as compared to&#13;
 genuinely foreign FDI. After removing FDI with a reported origin from likely tax havens, the ratio of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s FDI inflows over&#13;
 2007-2013 is around 1.8 percent, comparable to that for India and South Africa (Figure 25). This comparison may understate&#13;
 the amount of round-tripping in Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s inbound FDI since it may involve also other reported sources.&#13;
&#13;
 Non-tax haven FDI declined precipitously in 2013, but was partly replaced by FDI from tax havens (Figure 26). FDI from&#13;
 sources other than tax havens dropped in the first quarter of 2014 to US$6.6 from a record high of US$29.9 billion in the&#13;
 first quarter of 2013. FDI from tax havens has been highly volatile lately, but ticked up to US$5.5 billion in the first quarter&#13;
 of 2014. Thus, an increasing percentage of total FDI inflows are from tax havens: 45 percent in the first quarter of 2014&#13;
 as compared to 14 percent in 2012 and 25 percent in 2013. This suggests that substantial parts of the capital outflows in&#13;
 early 2014 may have returned to the country disguised as FDI.&#13;
&#13;
 Certain sectors are more attractive for round-tripping FDI. For example, 89 percent of the Russian FDI stock in basic metals&#13;
 and metal products originates in the countries of Cyprus, Bermuda and the Caribbean. Close to half of FDI in the services&#13;
 sectors and in construction is of the round-tripping type, with particularly high percentages in financial intermediation&#13;
 and real estate. By contrast, FDI in mining and quarrying and in most lines of manufacturing (other than iron and steel)&#13;
 is more likely to be high-quality FDI, proxied by the share of FDI that does not come from an obvious tax haven. Recent&#13;
 large cross-border mergers and acquisitions of Russian companies were carried out through such countries. Six of the nine&#13;
 largest transactions since 2008 have included either Cyprus or the Jersey Islands as a buyer or seller or as part of the chain&#13;
 of ownership.&#13;

1.5 The Government Budget â&#128;&#147; Currency Depreciation and Oil Windfall Mask&#13;
    Medium-Term Challenges&#13;
The budget balance improved in the first half of 2014 thanks to the depreciating Ruble, higher oil&#13;
prices than assumed in the budget, and prudent expenditure management. However, key medium-&#13;
term challenges persist. First, the non-oil deficit remains stubbornly high above 10 percent of GDP.&#13;
Second, weakness in subnational finances continues with debt levels on the rise. Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal buffers&#13;
remain below their levels before the global economic and financial crisis, yet investment rules for the&#13;
National Welfare Fund were recently loosened significantly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T   he federal budget balance for the first seven&#13;
    months of 2014 exceeded expectations&#13;
because of the currency depreciation and higher-&#13;
                                                                                    These trends resulted in a federal budget surplus&#13;
                                                                                    of 1.7 percent of GDP in January-July, three times&#13;
                                                                                    as large a year earlier. These numbers compare&#13;
than-projected oil prices, but a high non-oil                                       with a budget surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP under&#13;
deficit persists (Figure 28). Larger oil-related                                    the original budget and 0.4 percent under the&#13;
revenues helped boost federal budget revenues to                                    revised one (Box 7). However, given the weaker-&#13;
10.7 percent of GDP in January-July 2014 from 9.8                                   than-expected non-oil revenue performance,&#13;
percent a year earlier (Table 6). In line with global                               the non-oil deficit is likely to remain persistently&#13;
oil prices, the average oil price during January-                                   highâ&#128;&#149;above 10 percent of GDPâ&#128;&#149;despite the&#13;
July (US$107/bbl) remained above the $101/bbl                                       governmentâ&#128;&#153;s short- and medium-term goal of&#13;
assumed in the original 2014-2016 Budget Law                                        reducing it significantly. In fact, non-oil deficit&#13;

Federal government also tightly controlled budget                                   upwards. In addition, given the commitment of&#13;
spending during the first seven months of 2014:                                     large parts of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal buffers to growth-&#13;

expenditures for defense, administration, and                                       oil revenues and global oil price trends.&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal transfers rose from a&#13;

    Box 7      Amendments to the 2014-2016 Federal Budget Law&#13;
    In June, the amendments to the 2014-2016 Federal Budget Law were signed into law. Based on revised macroeconomic&#13;
    assumptions, including real GDP growth of 0.5 percent in 2014 instead of 3 percent and an uptick in the Urals oil price&#13;
    from US$101 to US$104 per barrel, oil revenue is projected to be 1.6 percent of GDP higher than originally budgeted and&#13;
    non-oil revenue is forecast to drop by 0.1 percent of GDP. Without changes on the expenditure side, the original budget&#13;
    deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP is projected to turn into a budget surplus of 0.4 percent, while the non-oil deficit would rise&#13;
    from the previously projected 9.4 percent of GDP again over the 10 percent mark to 10.1 percent of GDP (Table 6).&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;PART II&#13;
Economic Outlook&#13;
O   ver the medium term, growth will continue to be determined by slow progress in structural reforms&#13;
    and policy uncertainty emanating from geopolitical tensions. To account for the heightened&#13;
geopolitical risk the report presents a baseline scenario and two alternative scenarios. The challenges for&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s outlook are twofold: consumption growth is likely to weaken even further than projected in the&#13;
March version of the Russia Economic Report,11 and recovery in investment demand will be slower than&#13;
previously expected. The effects of weak growth for a second consecutive year, an increasing household&#13;
debt burden, and continued high inflation expectations, are likely to depress consumer demand further,&#13;
slowing this main engine of growth in Russia. These effects are expected to persist for the next two years.&#13;
With no major structural reforms planned, and microeconomic fundamentals unchanged, investment will&#13;
remain subdued and there will be only a limited positive effect from import substitution. Similarly, the&#13;
multiplier effect from the planned increase in public and quasi-public investment expenditures is likely to&#13;
be modest.&#13;

2.1 Global Outlook - Stagnation In The Face of Policy Uncertainty&#13;
The report presents three scenarios, the baseline, an optimistic one, and a pessimistic one. Our&#13;
baseline outlook is one of near stagnation, given the most likely path of continuing Russia-Ukraine&#13;
tensions and the persistence of related sanctions in an environment of stalling structural reforms. The&#13;
optimistic scenario projects a small recovery, facilitated by an end to geopolitical tensions and the&#13;
lifting of all sanctions by the end of 2014. The pessimistic scenario envisions an increasing intensity in&#13;
geopolitical tensions and further sanctions leading the economy into a low-level recession.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T   here are substantial risks to Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s medium-&#13;
    term growth prospects. Based on recent&#13;
developments, we see a large degree of stability&#13;
                                                        alter how the economy operates and might turn&#13;
                                                        out detrimental to its competitiveness. A return&#13;
                                                        to higher growth in Russia will depend on solid&#13;
in the economy despite the geopolitical tensions.       private investment growth and a lift in consumer&#13;
Macroeconomic stability prevailed and Russia            sentiment, which will require a predictable policy&#13;
remains in possession of large buffers to uphold        environment and addressing the unresolved&#13;
stability in the near futureâ&#128;&#149;as long as its access to   structural reform agenda (see section 3).&#13;
oil and gas markets is not restricted permanently.&#13;
The less good news is that we still see little          The key parameters for our outlook framework&#13;
movement on the structural reform agenda that           evolved from our March projections. Initially&#13;
could boost Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s growth potential in the            the geopolitical tensions brought with it much&#13;
medium-term. These observations together, result        uncertainty about how this shock would impact&#13;
in our most likely baseline scenario of a positive      the economy. After observing how the geopolitical&#13;
but low-growth outlook of near stagnation in 2015       uncertainty played out in the first half of 2014,&#13;
and 2016.                                               we expect to see continued strong but short-&#13;
                                                        lived market responses if tensions increase, with&#13;
Structural reform inertia, combined with high           a quick pricing-in of additional risks. However,&#13;
policy uncertainty related to political decisions       overall there was a fast adjustment to a relatively&#13;
around the geopolitical tensions, remains the           stable but slightly lower trajectory. This is also&#13;
deciding factors for our outlook. It is now policy      the essence of our revised scenarios. We regress&#13;
uncertainty about the economic course the               from our previous model of a one-time deep&#13;
country will take that is casting the longest shadow    shock and project now a more drawn-out impact&#13;

beginning of the geopolitical tensions, economic        view, much geopolitical uncertainty prevails. To&#13;

 Global growth is to remain subdued in 2014. Global growth estimates for 2014 have been revised further down, following&#13;
 signs of persistent stagnation in the Euro Area, Japan, parts of Latin America and emerging Europe. Conditions are gradually&#13;
 improving, but repeated forecast downgrades lead to a cautious assessment of the underlying strength of the recovery going&#13;
 forward. The world economy is forecast to grow at 2.6 percent in 2014, up from 2.4 percent in 2013. Gradually improving&#13;
 labor markets, accommodative monetary policy, and easing fiscal consolidation are expected to support growth in high-&#13;
 income countries, which in turn will benefit activity in developing countries through stronger trade, investment, and capital&#13;
 flows. From 2015, growth in both high-income and developing countries is expected to accelerate, reaching 2.4 percent&#13;
 and 5.3 percent.&#13;

 World demand for crude oil is expected to moderately increase, offset by good supply prospects from non-conventional&#13;
 sources. In 2014, global oil demand is expected to increase by 1.1 million barrel per day (mb/d) to reach 92.7 mb/d in 2014&#13;
 and 94.0 mb/din 2015. As in the recent past, all of the demand growth will originate in non-OECD countries. In fact, demand by&#13;
 OECD economies contracted during the first two quarters of 2014 (by 0.09 mb/d and 0.63 mb/d respectively).China is expected&#13;
 to be a key contributor to demand growth: during the past decade China has increased its consumption at almost 0.5 mb/da&#13;
 year. On the supply side, increase in crude output is expected for Iraq and Libya. Libya could boost its production to 1 mb/d by&#13;
 the end of September, up from 0.5 mb/d during the summer. Iraq is expected to account for 60 percent of OPECâ&#128;&#153;s additional&#13;
 capacity during the next five years (Figure 30). In the United States the Energy Information Agency forecasts US crude oil&#13;
 output to reach 9.28 mb/d day next year, the highest annual average since 1972. In fact, the crude oil shortfalls in various OPEC&#13;
 countries of the past few years have been counterbalanced almost barrel for barrel by rapid expansion of unconventional oil&#13;
 production in North America (shale oil in the US and tar sands in Canada).&#13;

 We expect the continuation of recent trends at the oil market and project an average oil price of 103/bbl in 2014 and&#13;
 of $100/bbl in 2015. Over the longer term, oil prices are expected to recede slightly in real terms due to growing supplies&#13;
 of unconventional oil, combined with efficiency gains and (to a lesser extent) substitution away from oil. The assumption&#13;
 behind such projections reflect the high cost of developing additional oil capacity, notably from the oil sands in Canada,&#13;
 which is currently assessed by the industry at about US$90/bbl in 2014 constant terms. OPEC, which usually limits supplies in&#13;
 order to sustain prices, may actually slightly increase supplies not to let prices rise too high for fear of inducing technological&#13;
 innovations that eventually could reduce oil demand. Removal of fuel subsidies, especially in Asia, is gaining momentum and&#13;
 will likely dampen further oil demand, especially in the longer termâ&#128;&#148;fossil-fuel consumption subsidies worldwide accounted&#13;
 for US$544 billion in 2012, half of which goes to oil products.&#13;

Investment and consumption activities will remain                               activity is projected to remain depressed despite&#13;

&#13;
  Box 9     The potential impact of import substitution&#13;
  Manufacturing industries took advantage of the sharp Ruble depreciation and import contraction in the first half of&#13;
  2014. The Ruble real effective exchange rate lost 6.4 percent in the first half of the year relative to the same period&#13;
  a year ago, which resulted in a contraction of imports. It appears that manufacturing industries reacted positively to&#13;
  changes in relative prices, reporting an acceleration of economic activities in the second quarter. Capacity utilization&#13;
  rates inched up (Figure 32). The positive impulse to manufacturing production from import substitution appeared to have&#13;
  been carried over into the third quarter. The seasonally adjusted HSBC Russia Manufacturing PMI remained above the 50&#13;
  threshold in July-August 2014 indicating cautious expansion, despite overall slowing consumer demand. The introduction&#13;
  of restrictions to food imports by Russia in August 2014 added to the potential positive impact of import substitution on&#13;
  economic activities.&#13;
&#13;
  However, the impact of import substitution could be short-lived and limited by structural constraints. In the third&#13;
  quarter of 2014, the Ruble stabilized around its medium-term equilibrium and the rate of depreciation slowed. This could&#13;
  close the depreciation window, through which manufacturing industries received some competitive advantage,by the&#13;
  end of 2014. Manufacturing firms might also again face capacity constraints. Although the nominal capacity utilization&#13;
  rate appears low (Figure 32), major tradable sectors were already at comparable levels of production capacity in 2013 as&#13;
  in 2007, when growth was approaching 8 percent. A further increase in the capacity utilization rate may be constrained&#13;
  and require capital investment. Firms also continue facing a tight labor market, which is reflected by steady growth in&#13;
  unit labor cost (Figure 33). As a result, import substituting firms will continue facing increasing cost pressures. Given&#13;
  constrained capacity, they may choose to increase prices rather than production. Agricultureâ&#128;&#149;in areas with relatively low&#13;
  capital intensity and shorter production cyclesâ&#128;&#149;could benefit from the import ban on food throughout 2015. Overall,&#13;
  the positive impact of import substitution will likely taper off in the second half of 2015, unless investments in capacity&#13;
  expansion are carried out.&#13;

     Box 10 Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s medium-term budget framework for 2015-2017&#13;
     The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s medium-term draft budget policy document Key directions of the budget policy for 2015 and for&#13;
     the planning period of 2016 and 2017 is currently discussed by the government and parliament. The draft contains&#13;
     a preliminary, medium-term budget forecast and some estimates for budget execution of 2014 budgets. Similar to the&#13;
     envisioned objectives of the medium-term framework documents of previous years, a gradual fiscal consolidation is&#13;
     planned. The key assumption is that the non-oil federal budget deficit will fall over time from 10.1 percent of GDP in&#13;
     2014 to 9.0 percent of GDP in 2017. The consolidated budget deficit is expected to rise to an altogether higher level than&#13;
     projected in the current Budget Law of 2014-1016 to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2015, a 1.4 percent of GDP increase over 2014.&#13;
     At the same time, consolidated revenue and expenditure are projected to decline by 1.4 percent of GDP and 0.9 percent of&#13;
     GDP respectively (Table 10). This constitutes a noticeably worsened of projections for the consolidated budget parameters&#13;
     compared to the previous framework of 2014-2016 and reflect changes in the geopolitical environment.&#13;

uncertainty and capital flight, high exchange                     in the fourth quarter of 2014 to support the Ruble&#13;

     Box 11 Recent poverty and inequality trends&#13;
     Low income growth resulted in less positive poverty dynamics during the first half of 2014. There was a small increase&#13;
     in the absolute number of poor since 2013. We estimate that the seasonally adjusted poverty rate for first quarter of 2014&#13;
     was the same as a year ago, 10.6 percent (Table 13). The total poverty rate for Russia is low compared to other countries&#13;
     in the Europe and Central Asia region, yet the variation across Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s regions remains significant (Figure 37). Among the&#13;
     regions with the lowest poverty rate are the resource-rich Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area (6.9 percent) and the Tatarstan&#13;
     Republic (7.2 percent), along with the Belgorod oblast (7.6) and Moscow oblast (7.7). The highest poverty rates are in&#13;
     the Tuva and Kalmyk republics (35.1 and 35.4 percent). Due to the strong seasonality in poverty and income dynamics,&#13;
     annual data is the more reliable indicator: the yearly poverty rate was almost flat at 11.0 percent in 2013 compared to&#13;
     10.7 percent in 2012. The average income growth was offset by faster growth in prices for goods in the poverty-line basket.&#13;

     Inequality measures for Russia remain stable. The Gini coefficient remains at the level of 0.418 (Figure 34), in line with&#13;
     the average for 2007-2013 when it stood at 0.420. Unfortunately, this indicator is not very informative in recording&#13;
     the changes in the shape of the distribution, so we also&#13;
     looked at indicators for recent middle-class dynamics in        Figure 35: Income distribution: share of population&#13;
     Russia. We defined the middle class as people with per          with per capita income in US$ PPP per day, percent&#13;
     capita income exceeding US$ 10 PPP per day . In 2011, the&#13;
                                                                 100&#13;
     share of the population belonging to this group increased&#13;
                                                                  90&#13;
     slightly to 63.3 percent from 62.6 percent in 2010 (Figure&#13;
     36). In 2012, this already high share increased further to   80&#13;
     68.4 percent. Within the Europe and Central Asia region,     70&#13;
     Russia is one of the best-performing countries when this     60&#13;
     middle-class definition is applied. However, a closer look   50&#13;
     to the distribution indicates that this growth was driven&#13;
                                                                  40&#13;

     people within that group. The share of population with a&#13;
     per capita income of US$25-50/day increased from 11.9        20&#13;
     percent in 2010 to 15.1 in 2012. The increase in the share   10&#13;
     of the population with an income of US$50/day was even        0&#13;
     steeper in relative termsâ&#128;&#149;from 3.6 percent in 2010 to 5.7      2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012&#13;

     with an income of US$10-25/day stagnated at around 47&#13;

     These estimations were done on RLMS data in the comparable approach with the Focus note of the Russia Economic Report no. 31. However,&#13;
      all this estimation should be taken with caution as survey data is usually biased downward due to underreporting of incomes and expenditures&#13;
      and under-representativeness of people with high incomes.&#13;

In addition to macroeconomic stability, this                                  increasing pressure for higher fiscal expenditure&#13;
would require a positive shift in business and                                and off-budget stimuli to the economy. Such&#13;
consumer confidence based on a predictable                                    stimuli might lead to some marginal and short-term&#13;
policy environment. Without significant structural                            growth impulses, but it would likely come at the&#13;
reforms directed towards strengthening regulatory                             cost of even higher inflation, thus not presenting a&#13;

unlikely to happen and would subdue long-term                                 best Central Bank policy or fiscal policy, and, in this&#13;
growth prospects. The current stalling of structural                          case, a fiscal stimulus could not mask them for&#13;
reforms represents a down-side risk to Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s                               long. However, adherence to a clear medium-term&#13;

&amp;#12;II. Economic Outlook&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Box 12 Russia and the World Trade Organization&#13;
     Russia formally joined the WTO on August 22, 2012, but its WTO commitments are designed to be implemented on a&#13;
     phased basis. They are laid out in a series of schedules included in the WTO Protocol of Accession. For example, tariffs are&#13;
     to be reduced gradually from the date of accession through 2019. Some liberalization in services is also on a phased-in&#13;
     basis, e.g. limitation of foreign equity for telecoms companies (2016) and market access for foreign insurance companies&#13;
     (2021). Russia has already joined the Information Technology Agreement. The country is obligated to join by 2016 the&#13;
     WTO Government Procurement Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
     Questions remain whether Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s regulatory standards affecting imports fully comply with WTO norms. During its&#13;
     accession process, Russia declared to the WTO Working Party that its regulations in the areas of technical barriers to&#13;
     trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) conform to the relevant provisions of the WTO TBT and SPS&#13;
     Agreements. However, many products that satisfy safety and health requirements in non-Russian markets appear not&#13;
     to satisfy Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s current regulatory standards.15 Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s standard-setting measures are based on a Soviet-era historical&#13;
     model, the GOST standards. The WTO Agreements require that national regulations shall be directed at legitimate objectives&#13;
     such as human health or safety; the health of animals, plants and the environment; national security requirements and&#13;
     the prevention of deceptive practices. It shall not be applied in a manner that would constitute a disguised restriction&#13;
     on international trade or create unnecessary obstacles to trade.16 There are concerns among Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s trading partners as&#13;
     to whether Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s current TBT and SPS practices conform to international standards, or provide the degree of market&#13;
     access envisioned by the relevant WTO agreements. These concerns give rise to potential challenges of such practices in&#13;
     the Dispute Settlement Mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
     In January 2014, Russia excluded the import of live pigs, pork, and pork products from the European Union by its SPS&#13;
     policy. Altogether, these products amounted in 2013 to US$1.3 billion in imports. On April 18, 2014, the EU requested&#13;
     consultations with the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) with regard to the ban of pork products. The pork product ban&#13;
     followed the detection of four cases of African swine fever in wild boar in Lithuania and Poland. However, the ban applies&#13;
     to live pigs, pork, and pork products from throughout the European Union. One issue in the dispute involves localization&#13;
     requirements, which refer to attempts by a country or customs territory (such as the EU) to impose measures for control&#13;
     of diseased animals on part of its territoryâ&#128;&#149;such as quarantinesâ&#128;&#149;and to have the rest of the territory certified as disease-&#13;
     free. Russia maintains that EU localization measures are not sufficient, that additional information is required, and the EU&#13;
     has not provided it. The EU states that it has sought to provide relevant information and that measures that would ban&#13;
     pork from, for example, Spain, because of SPS issues in Lithuania and Poland, are not scientifically grounded. It further&#13;
     states that Russia does not appear to effectively control the disease on its own territory, citing nearly 1,000 cases of the&#13;
     same disease among Russian wild boar and domesticated animals since 2007. On July 22, 2014, the DSB established a&#13;
     panel for the dispute.&#13;
&#13;
     The recent sanctions and countersanctions may pose additional challenges to the WTO. The Dispute Resolution&#13;
     Mechanism with appeal requires about 15 months to operate and, in practice, can take many years when there are strong&#13;
     disagreements between the parties. Moreover, parties have invoked national security concerns in connection to their&#13;
     sanctions. The WTO agreements contain a broad exception for countries to determine what national security measures&#13;
     they apply to trade (GATT 1947, Article XXI(b)(iii)17). Such claims have rarely been challenged historically, and there is little&#13;
     WTO jurisprudence on the potential contestability of national security measures.&#13;

W     orld Bank research on resource-rich nations suggests that economic diversification is neither&#13;
      necessary nor sufficient for economic development. Interventions to diversify economies appear&#13;
to work only when they are supported by policies to diversify their assets. There is a stronger correlation&#13;
between diversified assets and greater efficiency. This means the government needs to worry less about&#13;
the composition of exports and the profile of production, and more about the diversity of its national asset&#13;
portfolioâ&#128;&#148;the blend of natural resources, built capital, and economic institutions. This diversification&#13;
approach implies a rich reform agenda for Russia, as its portfolio is heavy in tangible assets such as oil&#13;
and gas, and even hard infrastructure such as schools, but it is still light in intangibles, such as institutions&#13;
for managing volatile resource earnings, providing high-quality social services, and even-handedly&#13;
regulating enterprises. It was investments in intangibles that allowed economies dominated by extractive&#13;
industries to become innovative and successful.&#13;

growth path in the past two decades differed in                            frontier. GDP grew by 95 percent, incomes per&#13;

To achieve higher growth Russia needs to&#13;
increase the contribution of labor and capital and     More transparent rules for investors would&#13;

            Russia economic report : policy uncertainty
            clouds medium-term prospects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Russia's economy is stagnating.
            Seasonally adjusted growth for the first two quarters of
            2014 was near zero. Consumer and business sentiments were
            already weak in 2013 due to lingering structural problems
            and contributed to the wait-and-see attitudes of households
            and companies. Heightened market volatility and policy
            uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions during the first
            half of this year exacerbated this confidence crisis. The
            Russian economy needed to internalize several rounds of
            sanctions, countersanctions and measures to stabilize the
            economy; this environment of higher risk lowered domestic
            demand. While the macroeconomic stabilization measures were
            timely and successful, medium term policy objectives are
            still being defined. This continued policy uncertainty about
            the economic course of the country is casting a shadow on
            Russia's medium-term prospects. Prospects for further
            poverty reduction and shared prosperity are limited. In the
            past, rising wages and pension transfers allowed Russia to
            reduce poverty significantly and to expand the ranks of the
            middle-class. Unless structural reforms to expand the
            economy&#146;s potential are pursued, low investment makes it
            less likely that plentiful well-paying jobs will be created.
            High inflation, moreover, will slow real income growth and
            hurt consumption growth, dimming the likelihood for further
            poverty reduction and limiting the ability of the bottom 40
            percent of the population to share in prosperity.
