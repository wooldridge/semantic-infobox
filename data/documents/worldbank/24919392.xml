&amp;#12;    Background&#13;
    Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is classified as a Fragile and Conflict-            This case study attempts to contribute to the theory that states&#13;
    Affected State. It has a complex government structure which is                   that the quality of implementation is the ultimate determiner&#13;
    plagued with significant political turmoil each election cycle. BiH              of the degree of reform success. Good laws, no matter how&#13;
    comprises the national (federal) level government, and two entities              well worded, make no difference if they are not implemented&#13;
    â&#128;&#147; the Federation BiH, Republika Srpska (RS), and Brcko District                  consistently, professionally, comprehensively. This document&#13;
    â&#128;&#147; all of which have strong legislative powers affecting day-to-day               explores the causal effect the projectâ&#128;&#153;s specific actions have had on&#13;
    business operations. The Federation BiH is further divided into 10               closing the regulatory implementation gaps identified in the areas&#13;
    cantons, each with their own government and legislative powers,                  of entrepreneurship and the construction laws in BiH.&#13;
    although ultimately they are governed by the laws of the Federation              The study consists of four parts. The first part details how the&#13;
    BiH. Both the Federation BiH and RS are further subdivided into                  team identified the existence of a regulatory implementation gap&#13;
    143 cities/municipalities, each with their own municipal councils.               and its causes. The second part analyses and describes the process&#13;
    Such a complex structure gives rise to overlapping competencies,                 of addressing the specific regulatory implementation gap identified&#13;
    conflicting legislative provisions, and a regulatory implementation              in part one. The third part provides details of the process of the&#13;
    gap at the sub-national level.                                                   regulatory simplification the team used to address the regulatory&#13;

    climate, as one of the cross-cutting tasks was to link reforms                   transparency. Finally, the study also distills the lessons learned&#13;
    at various levels of governments, to ensure the elimination of                   during this process that may be relevant for similar situations and&#13;
    contradictions and that their application is consistent at all levels.           environments elsewhere in the future. Part four cites those lessons.&#13;

    That is when it became clear that the same regulations have been&#13;
    implemented differently by the assessed three municipalities, thus&#13;
    creating this gap. In addition, a similar concern about sub-national&#13;
    regulatory implementation gaps in BiH was voiced by businesses&#13;
    and higher level authorities, but at the time no one could pin-point                                                                                              1. UNA-SANA CANTON&#13;

    results, that is to say in closing the regulatory implementation&#13;
    gaps at the sub-national level. The study also revealed the causal&#13;

     We are making a distinction between deficiencies in the way regulations are implemented/enforced and the poor quality of implementing reforms. The former&#13;
    (regulatory implementation gap) is about the system as it is currently operating while the latter (reform implementation gap) is about attempts to change the&#13;
    system. Much of the focus of this note is on the former, i.e. changing the way the existing regulations are implemented and about how reforms supported by the&#13;
    project attempted to address the issue of regulatory implementation gap as it relates to licenses and permits in the former sense. However, the case study also&#13;
    touches upon the reform implementation gap, albeit to a lesser degree, i.e. changing the existing system of implementing reforms â&#128;&#147; quality, pace, consistency.&#13;

&amp;#12;Part 1: Identifying the problem and its root causes&#13;
Defining the regulatory implementation gap&#13;
The regulatory implementation gap can be defined as the difference           Figure 1. Implementation gaps illustrated&#13;
between what the laws say on the statute books and how these laws&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                             LAW&#13;
function in reality. This is a concern for many countries worldwide&#13;
these days. The regulatory implementation gap is especially acute&#13;
in developing/transition economies. Over the years regulators have&#13;
emphasized the adoption or amendment of laws as the primary goal&#13;
of policy making. The assumption was that once a law is in place&#13;
                                                                                         Gap 1: Law vs Bylaws&#13;
its implementation will somehow automatically follow, and so the&#13;
anticipated results and impacts of reforms will be eventually gained&#13;
by the â&#128;&#152;simpleâ&#128;&#153; adoption of the law. Therefore, the majority of efforts                  Gap 2: Intended vs Actual Interpretation&#13;
have focused first and foremost on preparing good, state-of-the-&#13;
art laws.&#13;
                                                                                         Gap 3: Diï¬&#128;erent Application of a regulation&#13;
Experience has proved this assumption wrong2 . Over time the&#13;
                                                                                                within One Jurisdiction&#13;

has become evident that investing contemporaneously, in specific,                        Gap 4: Diï¬&#128;erent Application of a regulation&#13;
targeted efforts to enable implementation is equally important and                              across Diï¬&#128;erent Jurisdictions&#13;
critical, especially in countries with transition economies where&#13;
neither the institutional structures or existing incentives systems          It is important to differentiate the reasons why regulatory&#13;
nor human capacities are ready to embrace the changes introduced             implementation gaps happen. Typically there are four types of gaps.&#13;
by these new laws3 .                                                         1. Gap between laws and supporting bylaws, rules and regulations,&#13;
This regulatory implementation gap is likely to be wider in                       i.e. the latter does not follow the spirit of the former, or&#13;
countries with multi-layered government structures. Such is the                   supporting bylaws and regulations are non-existent.&#13;

cantons have the power to set their own rules, or simply bend the                 the actual interpretation. One of the causes of multiple&#13;

    The obvious question to ask is why obtaining the same permit meant       Further evidence of a regulatory implementation gap - case in point:&#13;
    addressing such different requirements in the same jurisdiction. Why     starting a craft shop in the Federation BiH&#13;
    did one municipality issue this permit within 20 days while others&#13;
    needed as much as 60 days (regardless of human capacities and IT         The Federation BiH established a requirement for a special permit to&#13;

    The real reasons underlying these application inconsistencies            implementation (based on a sample of 13 municipalities) of this law&#13;
    were poor regulatory service delivery, the lack of enforcement of        revealed that there were various inconsistencies in the number of&#13;
    procedures by higher level authorities, inadequate penalties for non-    documents asked of businesses during the application process for&#13;

The â&#128;&#152;howâ&#128;&#153; of identifying the problem and its causes&#13;
The T&amp;C team did a rigorous analysis of the problem and, more              â&#128;¢	   In general, the procedure for issuing urban permits for complex&#13;

requirements for the same regulation in the existing legislation as             buildings. This had been a huge bottleneck for companies.&#13;
well as to identify areas likely to benefit by a simplification of these   â&#128;¢	   The process and documentation for issuing a construction&#13;

Secondly, the team analyzed the practices of select municipalities&#13;

close the identified gaps by focusing on implementation.&#13;

Case in point: addressing the identified problems with BiH                 implementation. But, these regulatory changes would not be&#13;

Problem analysis provided the team with the important baseline of          the reform that the team provided to the Ministry.&#13;
the causes of inefficiencies and inconsistencies in implementation         Following the adoption of the new Law (in mid-2013) and new&#13;
as well as providing grounds for estimating the scope, depth and           unified requirements on the book, the T&amp;C team worked with the&#13;
breadth of the simplification activity needed.                             ministry to implement the reform on the ground. We helped to&#13;
In the RS, the T&amp;C team identified legal bottlenecks and a lack of         prepare rulebooks (adopted in early 2014), and a single submission&#13;
specificity in the Construction Law as causes of the inconsistencies       form for businesses (2014) which the ministry then distributed&#13;
in the regulatory requirements for obtaining a location permit             to all municipalities to use going forward. This was followed by&#13;
across municipalities. These causes refer, in addition to regulatory       further work with the ministry instructing these municipalities&#13;
implementation gap, to the reform implementation gaps, i.e.                on how to implement the new law, including two jointly organized&#13;
inconsistency and fragmented approach to implementing reforms.             technical seminars/training sessions for them on best practices&#13;
The team also identified different interpretations of the legal            implementation (in 2014). Following that, the T&amp;C team reached&#13;
provisions by some municipalities, coupled with their own additional       out to these seven municipalities together with the ministry and&#13;
requirements from businesses that added complexity. The response           checked implementation on the ground to ensure that the law was&#13;
to these deficiencies was two-fold:                                        being applied consistently across the board. Thereafter the ministry&#13;
                                                                           communicated to other municipalities to ensure the same. This has&#13;

The team worked very closely with the Ministry of Urban Planning           and a half.&#13;
and Construction RS in preparing the new law over a 10 month&#13;
period. They were instrumental in having new and innovative&#13;
provisions included in the law (none of which were present in the&#13;
old law), namely:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   The introduction of a risk-based approach: for buildings up to&#13;
     400 m2, the procedures for issuing a site/urban permit were&#13;
     abolished if a spatial/zoning plan had been adopted in a particular&#13;
     locale; this also meant that obtaining pre-approvals from utility&#13;
     companies for buildings under 400m2 was abolished.&#13;

     Closing the gap in the application of the location permits led to         with businesses. In total, compliance cost savings resulting from&#13;
     considerable monetary savings for businesses and citizens (Figure         this reform amounted to $1.1 million annually.&#13;

How this is achieved: the implementation phase - steps and timetable&#13;
&#13;
Since 2008, the WBG projects have achieved $12.4 million in                        This section describes what the typical regulatory simplification&#13;
compliance cost savings for businesses on the sub-national level                  engagement looks like at the sub-national level. This is not specific&#13;
only. Furthermore, this sub-national level work was subject to an                 to the regulations mentioned above. Rather the focus is on analyzing&#13;
independent impact assessment in 20156 which independently                        the entire spectrum of permits and licenses at the sub-national level&#13;
verified the results of the WBG efforts in closing/narrowing the                  to identify and pinpoint the gap and then set about narrowing it. The&#13;
regulatory implementation gap in this stratum. Data gathered                      idea behind this detailed and meticulous process is to: 1) reduce the&#13;
through the impact assessment revealed that there were no longer                  administrative burden for businesses; 2) increase the transparency&#13;
any variances in how the regulations governing construction                       of regulatory service delivery; and 3) reduce the regulatory&#13;
permits are applied in locales where the projects intervened and                  implementation gap.&#13;

and predictable now across these municipalities.                                  1 presents a breakdown of indicative activities as they took place&#13;
Impact assessment confirmed that in localities where these projects               during specific intervals of the project implementation.&#13;
intervened the following results were achieved:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	   A 6.41 percentage point increase in employment levels compared&#13;
     to other municipalities&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Procedure waiting times (to receive response from civil&#13;
     servants) reduced by 26 percent in localities where project was&#13;
     implemented, compared to other localities&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Increased transparency of regulatory service delivery through&#13;
     the use of electronic registers8&#13;

  Over 320 companies from 16 localities (8 where project work was done and 8 more comparable localities where there was no project work) surveyed on the&#13;
impact of 8 comparable licenses/permits per locality (the most frequent or most burdensome were selected). Moreover, detailed statistical data analysis and&#13;
interviews with municipalities and cantons were completed. Full impact assessment study and findings can be obtained separately by contacting Tarik Sahovic&#13;
at tsahovic@ifc.org.&#13;

  On average it is 4.1% cheaper on cantonal level and 23.3% on municipal level in localities where project was implemented, compared to where it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t. Also, on&#13;
average, firms spend 30% less time to file documents and complete procedure of applying for permit in localities where project was implemented.&#13;
8&#13;
  The Electronic registry is the online repository and data base of all licenses and permits in that jurisdiction. E-registry contains all information needed&#13;
regarding each of the procedures, including costs, documents, submission forms, and wait times among others. Based on impact assessment, on average, 60%&#13;
of firms use e-registers, which is significant. When comparing situations before and after e-registers, the majority of firms (2/3 of those under the survey who&#13;
used e-registers) confirmed that the time spent on procedures is now shorter and complexity has been reduced.&#13;

     Part 4: Lessons learned&#13;
     Through the process of closing the regulatory implementation gap           Hence, real determination is required from the project team to cause&#13;

     inform other similar engagements.                                          on the cooperation agreement should be done with the government&#13;

     The importance of taking a stakeholder approach. Involving a wide&#13;
                                                                                place, ministry heads are always changed; so having a single ministry&#13;
     group of stakeholders in the process from beginning to end is critical.&#13;
                                                                                sign the agreement might not be sustainable.&#13;
     Stakeholders can provide quick and realistic feedback regarding&#13;
     regulations implementation, for instance. They are also helpful in         Co-financing of project activities by the government further&#13;
     estimating how big the discrepancy in implementation is, what              improves the likelihood of efficient implementation and the&#13;
     the root causes are, is and what will be most useful in eliminating        governmentâ&#128;&#153;s determination to get results. The project on average&#13;
     the identified constraints. Engaging private sector stakeholders           charged clients with 9-10 percent of the project financial cost,&#13;
     in consultations â&#128;&#147; both in problem identification and solution             plus in-kind contribution. However, the sum of money in this case&#13;

     tougher reforms as well as assuring greater private sector impact.         to the cause and seriousness about changing the status quo. When&#13;
                                                                                clients commit any budgetary resources to project implementation,&#13;
     Similarly, the public sector must be part of the process and come to&#13;
                                                                                they treat the project much more seriously since they are accountable&#13;
     feel ownership of the reforms, to accept the proposed changes more&#13;
                                                                                for the money spent. This basically provides much more leverage for&#13;
     willingly and to ensure they are implemented properly.&#13;
                                                                                the project in the context of client priorities. It also helps to stoke&#13;
     In order to ensure stakeholders are engaged at the required level, a       reform momentum.&#13;
     mix of means and tools is recommended. These can include face-to-&#13;
                                                                                The need to involve key decision makers right from the start. One of&#13;
     face meetings/consultations or larger focus groups; or fact finding&#13;
                                                                                the main factors influencing project implementation is the inclusion&#13;
     events structured as public-private dialogue fora and surveys.&#13;
                                                                                of the main decision makers in the project, such as getting the mayor&#13;
     Needless to say, it is critical to review, update and guide stakeholder&#13;
                                                                                of a municipality or a local project coordinator to chair the working&#13;
     views and positions toward specific issues the project is dealing with&#13;
                                                                                group/body representing the client/institution. Rome was not built&#13;

     Local context matters. When designing the project delivery there is        there is a need to have somebody from the â&#128;&#152;insideâ&#128;&#153; of the municipality&#13;
     a need to ensure that it is localized and adjusted to client needs and     gain an in-depth understanding of what the team is trying to do, why&#13;
     to the local environment. Best practices, no matter how good they          it should be done and how important it is to do it now. This person&#13;
     may be and how well they have worked in many countries, should             should preferably be the decision maker in the municipality, leading&#13;
     be applied with caution and should be considered first in the local        and inspiring others to take action. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s why it is crucial for the&#13;
     context and environment. Contextualization is even more important          team to involve this person from the very beginning, and to have&#13;

     Formalizing relations with government counterparts for greater             and ensuring that he/she stays with the team, gaining a sense of&#13;

&amp;#12;      Annex 1 â&#128;&#147; step by step regulatory simplification methodology applied&#13;
&#13;
      Month 1 activities: administration, scoping and capacity building&#13;
      â&#128;¢	    Signing a cooperation/advisory agreement with the client.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	    Finalizing a clientâ&#128;&#153;s adoption of the relevant legal and regulatory decisions needed to enable the project to be implemented (establishment&#13;
            of a municipal working group; orders out to all civil servants to cooperate on the project; issuance of strict deadlines and procedures for&#13;
            civil servants to observe during project implementation, and the like).&#13;
      â&#128;¢	    Delivery of training to civil servants on the process of regulatory simplification and review.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	    Scoping the administrative procedures10 and analyzing the clientâ&#128;&#153;s capacities, followed by the identification and selection of possible&#13;
            counterparts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Month 2-3 activities: regulatory mapping and consultation process&#13;
      â&#128;¢	  Completing the regulatory mapping exercise of all administrative procedures administered by the client.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	  Collecting relevant economic data (and the frequency of all requests that the client has, fees, taxes, and any others).&#13;
      â&#128;¢	  Preparing and launching the consultation with the local business and civil community, seeking their input on the procedures, costs, and&#13;
          issues. Generally, stakeholder consultation is key throughout the entire process, from problem identification to solutions development&#13;
          to actual implementation of the solution.&#13;
      The team consults with both public sector officials at all levels and private sector companies that have undergone the process of receiving&#13;
      permits. This helps validate the problem, identify its scope and magnitude. Talking to businesses provides information that fosters&#13;
      understanding of the limitations and obstacles of specific licenses and permits and their actual implementation on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Month 4-7 activities: recommendations for regulatory simplification&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Analyzing the inventory of administrative procedures/licenses/permits.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Analyzing the legal basis for each procedure and identification of inconsistencies within higher-level regulations.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Comparing procedures with other locales within the same jurisdiction, and across jurisdictions with a view to harmonizing requirements.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Drafting recommendations for simplifying selected administrative procedures11 . The recommendations should be accompanied by&#13;
           justifications as to why the proposed solution should be seen as relevant and appropriate, what it will change if implemented and with&#13;
           what results.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Consulting with municipal officials on the quality of all recommendations, seek their feedback and input.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Completing an economic analysis (compliance cost savings) of baseline costs and estimated savings.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Finalizing recommendations for simplification and sending them for client approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Month 8 activities: implementation of regulatory simplification&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Design the E-Registry and complete the data entry.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Client adopts the recommendations for streamlining procedures.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   The relevant client governing body/council adopts all necessary decisions (if any) to enable implementation of the proposed&#13;
           recommendations.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	   Implementation procedures begin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Month 9-12 activities: ensuring the sustainability of activities&#13;
      â&#128;¢	  Establish clientâ&#128;&#153;s permanent regulatory reform bodiesâ&#128;&#153; monitoring work vis-Ã -vis the E Registry and control of the flow of the new&#13;
          administrative procedures. This body also monitors the introduction of new procedures.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Prepare the final inventory (meaning the final list of valid administrative procedures after the adoption and simplification processes are&#13;
          completed) and update the E-Registry accordingly.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Complete implementation of the proposed changes to simplify procedures for businesses.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Initiate evaluation of the projectâ&#128;&#153;s activities.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Verify the E-Registry testing. Launch the E-Registry.&#13;
      â&#128;¢	 Complete the monitoring and evaluation with businesses and verify implementation.&#13;
      The above activity list is indicative. It is provided only to give an idea of the type of activities the project has been involved in and the usual&#13;
      time line followed in their implementation. Naturally these activities, their sequence and time frames may differ depending on the context.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     10&#13;
       The term administrative procedure includes all permits, approvals, certificates, authorizations, estimates, assignments, consents, and payments of charges&#13;
     and fees, including notifications of the city/municipal administration required by third parties for operation of businesses and the day-to-day life of citizens.&#13;
     11&#13;
       Recommendations include reduction in information obligations, documentation; changing form of document submission (from original to copy, etc); reducing&#13;
     processing and waiting times; reducing fees, taxes; eliminating procedure/permit altogether.&#13;

            Closing the licensing and permit regulatory
            implementation gap at the sub-national level in Bosnia and
            Herzegovina : case study
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is
            classified as a Fragile and Conflict-Affected State. It has
            a complex government structure which is plagued with
            significant political turmoil each election cycle. BiH
            comprises the national (federal) level government, and two
            entities, the Federation BiH, Republika Srpska (RS), and
            Brcko District, all of which have strong legislative powers
            aff ecting day-to-day business operations. The Federation
            BiH is further divided into 10 cantons, each with their own
            government and legislative powers, although ultimately they
            are governed by the laws of the Federation BiH. Both the
            Federation BiH and RS are further subdivided into 143 cities
            and municipalities, each with their own municipal councils.
            Such a complex structure gives rise to overlapping
            competencies, conflicting legislative provisions, and a
            regulatory implementationgap at the sub-national level. The
            aim of this paper is to analyze and describe the approach,
            process and tools used by the team in identifying the
            problem of ambiguity in the text and the inconsistency of
            application of the same legislation across several BiH
            jurisdictions; and how the team’s decisions, activities and
            actions contributed to and influenced the results, that is
            to say in closing the regulatory implementation gaps at the
            sub-national level. The study also revealed the causal
            effect of the team’s efforts in terms of enabling the
            private sector to realize real benefits from the implemented
            reforms. The study consists of four parts. The first part
            details how the team identified the existence of a
            regulatory implementation gap and its causes. The second
            part analyses and describes the process of addressing the
            specific regulatory implementation gap identified in part
            one. The third part provides details of the process of the
            regulatory simplification the team used to address the
            regulatory implementation gap across jurisdictions, and to
            link these reforms with a reduction of the administrative
            burden and increased transparency. Finally, the study also
            distills the lessons learned during this process that may be
            relevant for similar situations and environments elsewhere
            in the future. Part four cites those lessons.
