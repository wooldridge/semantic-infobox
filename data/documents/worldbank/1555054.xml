FOSTERING THE CAPITAL-GOODS SECTOR IN LDCS&#13;
A Survey of Evidence and Requirements&#13;
The conventional arguments in favor of the production of capital&#13;
goods by LDCs are based on comparative advantage, the possibility of designs&#13;
appropriate to indigenous factor proportions, and the externalities conferred&#13;
on other sectors. Those arguments are inducing the governments of many&#13;
middle-income countries to foster the development of the capital-goods&#13;
sector. This raises questions about how, and at what pace, the production&#13;
of capital goods should be fostered. It also raises some associated questions.&#13;
o To what extent is comparative advantage in capital-goods&#13;
production attenuated by such conditions as low plantwide&#13;
productivity, adverse government policies, and weak sub-&#13;
contracting networks and materials suppliers?&#13;
o Are machinery designs in the LDCs appropriate to factor&#13;
proportions that prevail?&#13;
o What accounts for the apparent absence of design research&#13;
in the capital-goods sector of LDCs?&#13;
o What are the requirements for maintaining cost advantages&#13;
and producing appropriate machinery in a dynamic frame-&#13;
work in which product design and the production of capital-&#13;
goods are changing?&#13;
o What effect do the cost and character of marketing have on&#13;
the ability to export capital-goods?&#13;
This paper relies on a survey of the literature to shed light on,&#13;
and enable some judgments about, each of these questions.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This survey is an attempt to synthesize knowledge about the performance of&#13;
less developed countries (LDCs) in producing capital goods and the problems&#13;
associated with such production. Capital goods are here defined as including&#13;
industrial and agricultural machinery but excluding vehicles and electrical&#13;
equipment. Some of the discussion is based on a survey of evidence of the&#13;
recent experience of the principal LDCs producing capital goods: Argentina,&#13;
Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico, Pakistan, and Taiwan. Some of the discussion&#13;
is speculative. Although the evidence is far from being systematic, many of&#13;
the issues raised assume importance regardless of circumstances specific to&#13;
countries. The issues are important because of the drive in many LDCs to&#13;
foster the development of a capital-goods sector. They have implications for&#13;
the speed at which that sector should be developed.&#13;
The introductory remarks set out the conventional arguments for&#13;
establishing a capacity to produce capital goods in the LDCs: the comparative&#13;
advantage accruing from low costs of skilled labor; the capacity to produce&#13;
machines having designs that are appropriate to LDC factor proportions; the&#13;
prospect of having externalities spin off from the capital-goods sector to&#13;
increase the efficiency of the entire manufacturing sector and economy.&#13;
Issues associated with the first two arguments constitute the focus of this&#13;
survey. Externalities are ignored because of the complications in measuring&#13;
them and the undesirability of deciding to promote capital-goods production&#13;
on the basis of externalities alone.&#13;
The first section considers the evidence of comparative advantage&#13;
within a context of static cost efficiency. It is found that comparative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
advantage is attenuated by several conditions, all remediable to some extent:&#13;
low plantwide productivity; weak subcontracting networks and material sup-&#13;
pliers; and adverse government policies.    Evidence is then presented about&#13;
comparative cost structures in developed countries and in LDCs, evidence that&#13;
is consistent but at this point insufficiently systematic to permit definitive&#13;
conclusions.&#13;
The second section presents the information available on the&#13;
appropriateness of machinery design. It is found that equipment, for the&#13;
most part, has not been adapted to the factor proportions prevailing in LDCs.&#13;
This finding is b,ased, however, on an examination of major changes of factor&#13;
proportions through design adaptation, not minor changes.     Such minor changes,&#13;
while difficult to measure, potentially are at least as important as major&#13;
changes. The absence of major design alterations is undoubtedly related to&#13;
the more general absence of research activity.    In addition, it may reflect&#13;
the fact that most of the principal LDC producers have pursued policies of&#13;
intensive import substitution, which may well have decreased the derived&#13;
demand for adapted machinery.&#13;
The third section presents hypotheses about the apparent absence of&#13;
design research in the capital-goods sector of LDCs. There are numerous ad&#13;
hoc descriptions but few systematic studies of the extent of such research.&#13;
The most general impression conveyed by existing studies is the absence of&#13;
research to alter designs. The limited evidence on firms suggests that if a&#13;
research staff exists, it most often is devoted to questions not related to&#13;
design. The possibility is explored that the decision to purchase licenses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
rather than undertake local research is a rational response to current dif-&#13;
ferences in research ability. Such private decisions may not, however, be&#13;
socially optimal for a number of reasons, including capital-market imperfec-&#13;
tions and the possibility that research is an infant industry.&#13;
The fourth section considers the requirements for maintaining com-&#13;
parative advantage and producing appropriate machinery in a dynamic framework&#13;
in which product design and the production of capital goods are changing--a&#13;
framework in which LDCs producing capital goods must compete in design as well&#13;
as cost. Some of the cost-raising difficulties cited in the discussion of&#13;
comparative advantage can be ameliorated simply through greater experience&#13;
and a growing level of output; others will require special efforts. Labor&#13;
productivity on set tasks with given equipment is likely to improve over time.&#13;
Plantwide productivity should also grow as a consequence of an increase&#13;
in the output of individual plants, if it is assumed that this increase&#13;
permits greater use of special equipment and labor. In addition, greater&#13;
organizational experience should increase the ability of both the firm and the&#13;
sector to gain from subcontracting. Nevertheless x-inefficient practices--the&#13;
problems of layout, the misuse of existing machinery, the absence of conversion&#13;
guides for machine operators--are likely to require expenditure to obtain the&#13;
requisite knowledge. Although competitive pressure can provide a more recep-&#13;
tive atmosphere for the diffusion of the improved practice, explicit attention&#13;
to improving the institutional mechanisms is needed to shorten the learning&#13;
process. Reducing the performance gaps requires visits to foreign plants, the&#13;
use of external consultants, and the upgrading of both firm-level and industry-&#13;
wide research organizations to augment the knowledge of best practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
Implicit in the discussion is the greater difficulty of meeting&#13;
the requirements in the dynamic context than in the static context, for it&#13;
becomes a matter of maintaining cost advantages while at the same time acquir-&#13;
ing a design capability. To sustain or improve the competitiveness of LDC&#13;
capital goods requires a research capability to offset to some extent the&#13;
effects of improving designs in the developed countries. In the absence of a&#13;
design ability, LDCs can for a time forestall the loss of competitiveness by&#13;
reducing the costs of production through process research: that is, research&#13;
to increase productivity. Eventually, however, more fundamental efforts will&#13;
be required to increase competitiveness, particularly by making design changes.&#13;
The fifth section moves beyond production to marketing, centering&#13;
on the ability to export. For sectors other than capital goods, LDC pro-&#13;
ducers have rarely had to assume the entire marketing effort from design to&#13;
sales in the developed countries. For capital goods, however, marketing is&#13;
much more complex. Extensive networks for overseas sales and servicing need&#13;
to be established, but even the mature LDC producers have had little such&#13;
experience. Moreover the ability of equipment producers to extend credit&#13;
and provide performance bonds is a critical feature in exporting. Until&#13;
recently producers have made only limited efforts in these areas not related&#13;
to production. The character and costs of marketing may explain why most&#13;
producers concentrate on the market for industrial machinery in developed&#13;
countries, not on the smaller markets in LDCs: there are likely to be scale&#13;
economies with respect to identifying markets, tailoring products to specific&#13;
countries, and establishing sales and servicing networks. It is found that&#13;
the difficulties likely to be encountered in exporting may have important&#13;
implications for production efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-v -&#13;
The final section sets forth some policy implications derived from&#13;
the preceding analysis. These include measures to increase productive effi-&#13;
ciency and to encourage local research. Policies to increase local research&#13;
include both implicit and explicit ones, the former working indirectly through&#13;
changes in economic policies, the latter being direct efforts to build up the&#13;
research capability of local institutions. The appropriate mix of these&#13;
policies of course depends on circumstances specific to countries. But it is&#13;
important to note that the appropriate source of funding for activities asso-&#13;
ciated with such policies will be partly determined by the competitive&#13;
structure of the capital-goods sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
The conventional arguments for fostering the production of capital goods in&#13;
LDCs fall into three categories: the comparative advantage accruing from low&#13;
labor costs; the capacity to produce machines having appropriate designs; and&#13;
the prospect of externalities.&#13;
Even in advanced countries, the capital-goods sector is labor-inten-&#13;
sive, more specifically skilled labor-intensive. A number of LDCs have&#13;
a substantial supply of skilled workers available at a fraction of the wage&#13;
paid to their counterparts in developed countries. If it is assumed that&#13;
they do not exhibit commensurately lower productivity, their wage levels&#13;
should confer a cost advantage. The remuneration is relatively low not only&#13;
for skilled operatives but for engineers and technicians. Because the sector&#13;
requires substantial services from engineers and technicians--services ranging&#13;
from design to prototype production--its comparative advantage in LDCs is&#13;
further enhanced. In addition, exports often require that engineers and&#13;
technicians employed by the seller reside in the importing country for a&#13;
fairly long period (Cortes 1978). The lower expatriate allowances typical of&#13;
skilled LDC personnel constitute still another advantage.&#13;
The production of capital goods often evokes images of large, highly&#13;
mechanized plants in which scale economies, particularly in the use of capital,&#13;
may attenuate any advantage LDCs derive from lower labor costs. But many&#13;
subsectors of the capital-goods industry, even in the United States, have a&#13;
relatively large number of small firms producing a significant portion of&#13;
value added (table 1). This pattern has existed throughout the century and&#13;

is not attributable to factor market imperfections: the wage rate paid by the&#13;
smaller firms is roughly similar to that of large firms, and it seems unlikely&#13;
that the firm structure would be maintained in the face of low returns on&#13;
capital. Moreover the average product of labor is fairly similar among firms&#13;
of varying size (table 2). If it is assumed that the higher labor-capital&#13;
ratio of smaller firms is reflected in at least the same average product of&#13;
capital, total factor productivity is not likely to be lower in small&#13;
companies. 1/&#13;
Thus, insofar as the industrial structure of the United States&#13;
provides a guide, firms of varying size may be efficient, and the wage advan-&#13;
tages of LDCs need not be offset by lower productivity or the failure to&#13;
realize scale economies. It is necessary, however, to consider the two other&#13;
principal cost components in any sector: materials and capital. As will be&#13;
shown, full recognition of these components leads to a more qualified view of&#13;
the probable degree of static comparative advantage currently enjoyed by LDC&#13;
producers.&#13;
The production of appropriate machinery is the second argument. If&#13;
LDC firms produce machinery more in keeping with the relative factor endow-&#13;
ments of LDCs, that production would have a desirable effect on both income&#13;
1/   The existence of a spectrum of firms of varying size may partly reflect&#13;
the production of different commodities within the 4- or 5-digit indus-&#13;
trial classification, with each individual product being produced&#13;
by a narrower range of firms (by size) than appears in the broader&#13;
grouping. If this is the case, the potential comparative advantage in&#13;
LDCs would be in product lines for which the average firm size is small.&#13;

generation and employment opportunities. 1/ For example, India with its&#13;
large supply of unskilled labor would benefit from the local production and&#13;
adoption of equipment that, for a given investment level, uses more labor than&#13;
is required by imported equipment from the advanced countries. Cost minimiz-&#13;
ation by local users of equipment would lead to a demand for more labor-&#13;
intensive machines, a demand which domestic manufacturers might be more&#13;
likely to satisfy than would producers in developed countries. Satisfying&#13;
this demand does not imply that the equipment produced would be expected to be&#13;
frozen at a primitive level. Instead 1960 or 1965 models could be produced&#13;
and gradually updated as changing factor scarcities warranted. 2/&#13;
Production of equipment of an older vintage, augmented by the&#13;
ability to organize turnkey plants, would increase the range of factor&#13;
choice both in the equipment-producing country and the importing country.3/&#13;
As an important by-product, LDC engineering-consulting firms could provide a&#13;
range of information different from that available from firms in developed&#13;
countries, as could the salesmen of producers. Even if initial presenta-&#13;
tions do not lead to sales, reiteration by salesmen of the existence of&#13;
alternate sources of machinery could make purchasers more receptive to LDC&#13;
equipment, thus yielding externalities to LDC producers as a group.&#13;
1/   For an elaboration of this as well as other possibilities that militate&#13;
in favor of the establishment or expansion of LDC capital-goods produc-&#13;
tion, see Pack and Todaro (1969). These are only possibilities, however,&#13;
and their realization must be checked against available evidence. See&#13;
the discussion of the requirements of cost efficiency in the next section.&#13;
2/   The ability to modernize is a central issue.   It will be considered in&#13;
the section on the requirements of cost efficiency and design innovation.&#13;
3/   Turnkey plants are integrated factories designed by equipment producers&#13;
or consulting engineers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
The prospect of externalities is the third argument: the skills&#13;
generated in the mechanical-engineering sector are useful in other sectors.&#13;
Some workers engaged in the production of equipment may move to the equipment-&#13;
purchasing sectors. Given the frequent process-interruptions attributable to&#13;
poor maintenance and repair, such a diffusion of skilled workers would permit&#13;
an increase in the use of plant and unskilled workers. Moreover the willing-&#13;
ness to use second-hand equipment might be greater if firms have confidence in&#13;
their own repair skills and their ability to produce spare parts. One risk&#13;
noted in the use of second-hand equipment is the difficulty of reestablishing&#13;
the initial performance standards in a new environment after dismantling,&#13;
crating, shipping, and reinstallation (Cooper and Kaplinsky 1974). Such&#13;
obstacles can be reduced if persons with experience in machine construction&#13;
do the maintenance.&#13;
A local ability to produce capital goods could contribute to the&#13;
adaptation of imported equipment to obtain better local performance than&#13;
from an unimproved model. Just as agricultural technology requires local&#13;
adaptive efforts for maximum productivity, a similar effort is likely to be&#13;
needed in manufacturing. For example, differences in the scale of operations,&#13;
the quality of raw material, and the skills of workers may reduce the output&#13;
obtainable from an "unimproved" imported machine. Although the purveyors of&#13;
turnkey plants or individual machines might also help in these respects, the&#13;
accumulation of experience by local firms is likely to prove more effective.&#13;
Problems would not be approached on a one-shot basis, and skills obtained in&#13;
one set of adaptations would likely be transferable to others.&#13;
Although the potential for obtaining an augmented range of equip-&#13;
ment, as well as externalities, increases the attractiveness of the machinery&#13;
&#13;

industries, it should be emphasized that, even without this potential, the&#13;
efficient, labor-intensive earning of foreign exchange may offer an important,&#13;
largely neglected source of future growth for countries with the requisite&#13;
supplies of skilled labor. As shall be shown, however, such growth may&#13;
face obstacles typically neglected by the simple theory of comparative&#13;
advantage.&#13;
The focus of this paper is on the first two categories of conven-&#13;
tional arguments for fostering the production of capital goods in LDCs. The&#13;
externalities to other sectors are not considered because of the paucity of&#13;
evidence. By their nature these externalities require evidence of the benefits&#13;
the engineering sector confers on those other sectors, including the diffusion&#13;
of skills by movements of workers among industries and the design of special&#13;
devices that can improve the local performance of imported equipment. His-&#13;
torical evidence indicates that these benefits have been substantial in the&#13;
industrial countries; indeed nations with a small, backward engineering sector&#13;
have suffered. 1/ There is no reason LDCs could not derive similar benefits.&#13;
On the other hand, if the encouragement of the capital-goods sector cannot be&#13;
based on the potential for cost efficiency, on adaptive design behavior, or on&#13;
both, the invocation of externalities cannot at this stage of knowledge serve&#13;
as a justification. The empirical base is too small to argue the relative&#13;
magnitude of such benefits to other sectors.&#13;

EVIDENCE OF COST EFFICIENCY&#13;
The survey of production problems in this section is not intended to question&#13;
the eventual emergence of efficient capital-goods manufacturing in the count-&#13;
ries examined or in some even smaller producers. Instead it emphasizes that&#13;
even advanced producer-nations encounter severe production problems, which&#13;
significantly increase their costs. The amelioration of existing difficulties&#13;
offers an opportunity for the reduction of costs in the intermediate term, a&#13;
reduction that can provide a cushion in the transition to a status in which&#13;
production is efficiently executed and domestic innovation, previously of&#13;
limited significance, begins to make a contribution to the competitiveness of&#13;
the industry.&#13;
To describe and analyze the costs of production in the mechanical-&#13;
engineering sector, I draw on the recent experience of the principal LDC&#13;
producers: Argentina, Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico, Pakistan, and Taiwan. 1/&#13;
I consider both the producers of equipment and their suppliers in the metal-&#13;
products sector, particularly foundries and forges. The analysis thus centers&#13;
on the later stages of production of engineering products and does not&#13;
include iron and steel operations or specialty metal products necessary&#13;
for the sector. Although domestic production of basic metals at high cost&#13;
behind tariff protection would reduce any cost advantage inherent in the LDC&#13;
fabricating sector, this competitiveness can be restored by liberalizing the&#13;
trade regime. Any cost disadvantages on this account should not be viewed as&#13;
militating against the competitiveness of the mechanical-engineering sector.&#13;
If liberalization were not implemented, the sector would of course be penalized.&#13;
1/   The studies drawn upon are listed under country headings in the bibliography.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
The potential cost advantage among the enormously varied range of&#13;
engineering products can be rigorously analyzed only within a fully articu-&#13;
lated model of the mechanical-engineering industry. The optimum technical&#13;
organization of even a fairly simple engineering product, compared with any&#13;
process-centered production activity, is particularly difficult. In a recent&#13;
study Lamyai, Rhee, and Westphal (1978) demonstrate that optimal use of either&#13;
labor or equipment can lead, when compared with a suboptimal solution, to as&#13;
much as a 90-percent reduction in average cost. Larger batches of an identical&#13;
product reduce the set-up times of equipment and the skilled labor per unit&#13;
of output; the manufacture of different products having similar requirements&#13;
of skill and equipment can increase the rate of use of both inputs.&#13;
It might come as a surprise that the correct use of skilled labor&#13;
can be as important as the optimal use of equipment in reducing costs. If&#13;
plants in developed countries typically exhibit higher utilization rates per&#13;
hour for skilled labor and equipment than LDC firms do, they are likely to&#13;
exhibit greater plant-wide efficiency. Thus, if the LDCs are to be competi-&#13;
tive in engineering activities, productivity on individual tasks must be&#13;
sufficiently high or factor prices or material costs must be sufficiently low&#13;
to offset the probable firmwide productivity difference.&#13;
As will be shown, a considerable number of simple production&#13;
problems exist, even for products in which LDCs may have a comparative advan-&#13;
tage if reasonable levels of x-efficiency were realized. I/ Of course,&#13;
1/   A number of complex issues analyzed by Lamyai, Rhee, and Westphal (1978)&#13;
are omitted here because an adequate treatment would take the discussion&#13;
too far afield. For example, sufficiently large batches of a single&#13;
product may warrant changing the entire production process--say,&#13;
substituting special purpose equipment for general purpose equipment and&#13;
concomitantly decreasing the relative importance of skilled operatives--&#13;
rather than simply lead to reduced costs for a given regime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
similar problems of static inefficiency arise in most industrial activities&#13;
within LDCs, problems which explain the level and variation of effective&#13;
protection across sectors. Unless x-efficiency is worse and prospects for&#13;
improvement are poorer in capital goods than in other sectors, the problems&#13;
described do not constitute an argument against the sector. Instead the&#13;
following analysis is designed to move the discussion from the simple factor-&#13;
proportions model of capital, unskilled labor, and skilled labor toward a&#13;
fuller consideration of various issues. Those issues include the productivity&#13;
of workers on tasks, the low productivity of plants, the weakness of the&#13;
subcontracting network, the poor record of some supplying sectors, and&#13;
adverse policies of government. These categories are not airtight but are&#13;
adopted here for expositional convenience.&#13;
Task-level productivity&#13;
Although skilled operatives in LDCs receive lower wages than those&#13;
in developed countries, the obvious question is whether labor productivity&#13;
is proportionally lower than warranted by the smaller quantity of capital&#13;
per worker, and thus nullifies the wage difference. It is useful to dis-&#13;
tinguish two aspects of labor productivity. The first is the number of items&#13;
produced per minute by a worker on a set task, such as cutting a block of&#13;
metal, if it can be assumed that the metal is available, machines are in good&#13;
order, and so on. The second is the output per operative day, which depends&#13;
on the first aspect and on the rate at which metal is made available, the fre-&#13;
quency of mechanical breakdowns not attributable to the operative, the time&#13;
operatives spend moving material among work stations, the number of different&#13;
tasks assigned to each worker and their respective set-up times, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
The second aspect reflects the management ability of a firm and the environment&#13;
outside the firm, though capable managers may be able to mitigate such deleter-&#13;
ious external factors as irregular deliveries of raw materials.&#13;
Most observations of the factories operating in the LDCs indicate&#13;
that the performance of operatives on a given task is high, despite the use of&#13;
less sophisticated equipment. In many activities their performance equals that&#13;
of factory workers in developed countries; rarely is it less than 30 percent&#13;
of their level. 1/ Productivity on a plantwide basis, however, often is&#13;
much lower. For example, in the Indian textile-machinery sector, labor&#13;
productivity in the best firms was estimated at a third of that in European&#13;
companies and, in the worst, at a tenth. Nevertheless wages a twelfth of the&#13;
European level permit lower unit labor costs in both sets. Similarly a study&#13;
in Korea of the entire mechanical-engineering sector found labor productivity&#13;
to be 20 to 30 percent of that in Britain and the United States; wages were&#13;
less than 10 percent of those in Britain and the United States. For Indian&#13;
forging plants it has been reported that productivity on set tasks is only&#13;
slightly lower, whereas plantwide labor productivity is about a sixth of that&#13;
in developed countries.&#13;
Lower productivity at the task level, when it was observed, was&#13;
attributed to a variety of causes: inadequate instruction about the potential&#13;
cutting effectiveness of a machine tool, which workers were using at its&#13;
currently misestimated potential; poor working conditions, such as a lack of&#13;
clear floor space on which to begin a new job; the use of poor cutting tools&#13;
1/   Among the studies relevant to worker productivity are that on machinery&#13;
industries in Korea (World Bank 1978) and those for foundries (World Bank&#13;
1974a), steel forging (World Bank 1974b), and textile machinery (World&#13;
Bank 1975) in India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and tool holders; the absence of technical aids to operatives; and the failure&#13;
to employ jigs and fixtures in setting-up operations. 1/&#13;
Among these problems, it is useful to distinguish those which pos-&#13;
sibly reflect a movement along a production function in response to the low&#13;
wage-rental ratio (the use of poor-quality cutting tools and the absence of&#13;
jigs) and those which result in a failure to reach the production function or&#13;
in x-inefficiency (the misestimation of machine potential). It is not always&#13;
easy to determine the group in which a specific observation is best&#13;
placed, but the analytical distinction is important because the first group&#13;
presumably leads to a decrease in production costs while the latter increases&#13;
them. Moreover, as factor prices change, labor productivity will improve if&#13;
firms are rationally responding to relative factor prices, whereas a movement&#13;
toward the production function may not occur without some form of technical&#13;
aid.&#13;
I turn now to an example of factors impinging on task-level pro-&#13;
ductivity. Although it is drawn from the detailed account of a recent study&#13;
of machinery industries in Korea, similar examples are found in descriptions&#13;
of other countries.&#13;
In the best-run Western machinery and metal working&#13;
establishments, there is an abundance of technical&#13;
material available to the machine operator and the&#13;
first-line supervisors. These materials take the&#13;
form of wall charts, tabular materials, condensed&#13;
handbooks of technical information, etc., all of&#13;
which are designed to assist the man in making proper&#13;
measurements, making conversions from one type of&#13;
system to another (e.g., English measures into metric),&#13;
1/   A graphic description of some poor working conditions is provided in the&#13;
study of machinery industries in Korea (World Bank 1978, ch. 3). Many of&#13;
these conditions also affect the productivity of the capital and material&#13;
inputs.&#13;

to choose the right feed and speed for the machine&#13;
based on the type of material being worked and the&#13;
type of operation, and a variety of other technical&#13;
information to assist in day-to-day standard opera-&#13;
tions in the plant. This kind of material was notice-&#13;
ably lacking in the plants visited. There is, of&#13;
course, a good deal of documentation available to the&#13;
front office management, the plant engineer, the pro-&#13;
duction manager, etc., on the characteristics, design,&#13;
functions, speeds and feeds for the specific machines&#13;
in the shop, but that kind of information is at a&#13;
different level from the kind being described here,&#13;
which is standardized technical information that is&#13;
necessary on the shop floor so that the operators and&#13;
first-line supervisors will not have to do standard&#13;
calculations, nor make guesses that can lead to mis-&#13;
takes when there is a simple way to look it up&#13;
(World Bank 1978).&#13;
The foregoing example of the source and character of x-inefficiency can be&#13;
supplemented by numerical estimates, such as the observation in several plants&#13;
that the output obtained from machine tools by a given worker could be in-&#13;
creased 40 percent if improved inexpensive cutting devices were used. Simi-&#13;
larly a large milling machine which could hold a "cutter of 12 to 18 inches&#13;
in diameter was using a cutter of 3 to 4 inches, and even this cutter was not&#13;
removing metal at more than 50 percent of its potential capacity" (ibid.)&#13;
Plantwide productivity&#13;
What is the cause of the discrepancy between task-level and plant-&#13;
wide labor efficiency? What factors affect the efficiency of use of equipment&#13;
and materials?&#13;
Plant layout and scheduling have a substantial effect on produc-&#13;
tivity. In many machine-producing activities neither the order of operation&#13;
nor the placement of machines is inherent in the process. Nor is it physically&#13;
difficult simply to stop the process and hold a partly finished piece at a&#13;
work station until it again is convenient to work on it. The difficulties&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
raised by the wide latitude of choice could be solved by adequate management.&#13;
But many of the detailed studies of plant operations in LDCs indicate that the&#13;
difficulties are not avoided. The typical plant exhibits a poor layout in&#13;
which the movement of work in process interferes with operations at individual&#13;
work stations, where an accumulation of partly finished pieces is being held&#13;
until workers return to them. And despite the fact that the diversity of&#13;
products requires careful scheduling to increase the use of equipment, all of&#13;
the surveys report poor scheduling. 1/ Not only is the use of equipment and&#13;
labor reduced; there also are delays in identifying and correcting errors&#13;
(World Bank 1974b). Thus the productivity of both labor and equipment are&#13;
decreased, and the substantial work-in-process inventory generates interest&#13;
charges that are higher than necessary. Here is a description of the effect&#13;
of poor scheduling on labor productivity:&#13;
The common pattern was one of machine placement that&#13;
is haphazard rather than allowing for an orderly flow&#13;
of work. Floor space is very crowded and the operation&#13;
of machining, fabrication of components, assembly of&#13;
parts, are scattered in any place that happens to have&#13;
available room. Too much time is spent finding work,&#13;
or the next job, or material. In some cases the men&#13;
have to find their own area in which to work, perhaps&#13;
make up some form of fixtures of their own, or find&#13;
the means to obtain levels or measurements to work&#13;
from. The almost universal characteristic is one of&#13;
congestion and a mixing of operations that frequently&#13;
leads to deterioration of quality because of improper&#13;
floor planning. There is no adequate provision for&#13;
working space around the main machines and the aisle-&#13;
ways that are normally used to carry the flow of work&#13;
are completely congested with work-in-process. There&#13;
are typically about double the number of machines per&#13;
square unit of floor space than there would be in an&#13;
efficient layout. This is exacerbated by another con-&#13;
dition, namely, wherever there is some vacant space&#13;
because of temporary slowing down of poor operating&#13;
1/   For an example see the study of forging in India (World Bank 1974b,&#13;
pp. 16-17).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
practices, the tendency is for many small operations&#13;
to settle in as "squatters" doing assembly of small&#13;
components, or a welding and/or cutting operation&#13;
(World Bank 1978).&#13;
The congestion noted was not attributed to inadequate floor space and cannot&#13;
be viewed as an optimizing response to a specific factor shortage.&#13;
A recurrent finding of the studies in all countries has been the&#13;
low capacity utilization of equipment. Although it now is commonplace to&#13;
find low capacity utilization in many LDC industrial sectors, it seems likely&#13;
that the cause of the difficulty is somewhat different for nonprocess indus-&#13;
tries than for process industries.&#13;
Mechanical-engineering plants use a number of costly individual&#13;
items, such as fixures, machine tools, and welding equipment. Each can be&#13;
fully utilized if a plant produces a large number of items of a single type or&#13;
a range of products that require a similar operation--stamping, for example.&#13;
A large batch of a single item would be produced at lower cost than smaller&#13;
lots of a number of products because of the difference in set-up time. 1/&#13;
The higher cost of production in small lots would slow the long-run growth&#13;
of the product's sales, given the domestic demand curve. Although it might&#13;
be argued that the excess capacity could be used for exports and thus yield&#13;
a reduction in production costs, the difficulties of marketing mechanical-&#13;
engineering products precludes this pursuit as a short-term strategy for most&#13;
products, even though some standard products, such as simple lathes, might&#13;
respond to greater export effort. The intrinsic problem of efficiently using&#13;
1/   For a detailed discussion and sample computations see Lamyai, Rhee, and&#13;
Westphal (1978). In relatively inexperienced firms the organizational&#13;
costs of managerial time necessary to realize such sharing may offset&#13;
some of the technical economies so that the reductions in direct produc-&#13;
tion costs are greater than the net decrease. See the next subsection&#13;
on subcontracting networks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
a given machine or set of machines will become less severe with the growth of&#13;
the domestic market and, as efficiency and marketing ability increase, with&#13;
the growth of exports. At their current stage of development, however, many&#13;
LDCs producing significant quantities of machinery exhibit low rates of&#13;
capacity use, which clearly undercut their efficiency in relation to their&#13;
competitors in developed countries.&#13;
Materials management is a related area of weak performance. In&#13;
Indian foundries it was often found that scraps and castings were not returned&#13;
to their proper place for storage and that sand accumulating on the floor was&#13;
removed only when little working space was left (World Bank 1974a). The same&#13;
phenomenon was noted in Korean plants, in which as "much as 50 percent of the&#13;
total floor area [was] occupied with heaps of discarded sand which had been&#13;
knocked away from previous castings" (World Bank 1978, p. 67).&#13;
Subcontracting networks&#13;
A principal requirement of the entire mechanical-engineering sector&#13;
is the development of a subcontracting network. In the machinery sector of&#13;
the advanced countries, subcontracting has proved to be important in reducing&#13;
costs. Small firms concentrating on a few operations or components common to&#13;
a large number of producers are able to utilize special-purpose equipment&#13;
fully, as well as obtain the benefits of learning over time as a result of&#13;
specialization in a narrow area. If the volume were sufficient, such special-&#13;
ization could occur within larger firms, but quantities currently produced are&#13;
too small to allow this.&#13;
There are two requisites for obtaining the potential benefits of&#13;
subcontracting. First, the parent firm must be able to coordinate multiple&#13;
sources of supply so that production is not interrupted by the absence of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
components. Second, the subcontractors must be efficient and reliable. The&#13;
evidence in the country studies surveyed in this paper suggests that sub-&#13;
contracting, although extant in some countries and in some sectors, is limited.&#13;
This results partly from the unreliability of existing subcontractors in&#13;
meeting delivery dates and quality specifications, partly from their relatively&#13;
high costs. It is unclear whether larger firms encounter limits on their&#13;
ability to organize a subcontracting network, because the typical reason&#13;
adduced for the absence of such a network is the low quality of subcontractors.&#13;
Nevertheless the observations of plant layout and other intraplant production&#13;
difficulties suggest that some of the problem may reside in the parent firms.&#13;
That would imply that the organizational costs of subcontracting may currently&#13;
exceed the cost reductions to be derived from it--that is, from the greater&#13;
factor utilization and the learning stemming from specialization. That would&#13;
also imply that an improved sectoral division of labor is contingent upon the&#13;
accumulation oE adequate organizational ability. Those imaplications can be&#13;
set down briefly as follows.&#13;
Let C'I and C'E be the marginal costs of internal arid external&#13;
coordination, P'I and P'E the marginal costs of internal and external produc-&#13;
tion.  Unless C' I &gt; C E - (P I - P E) the firm will not engage in subcontract-&#13;
ing.  Such a decision may be short-sighted if the firm's estimnate of P'   is&#13;
based solely on the reduction in cost achievable through greater rates of use&#13;
of labor and special-purpose equipment by the subcontractor, but not on the&#13;
subcontractor's eventual reduction in cost obtainable through learning by&#13;
doing. 1/  Similarly the learning may reduce C' .   The basis for several&#13;
1/   Such benefits may also accrue to the captive operations of firms; the&#13;
existence of extensive subcontracting in advanced countries suggests&#13;
that learning is likely to be greater in more specialized firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
recent government efforts to foster subcontracting can only be the attribution&#13;
of such short-sightedness. Simple assertions of the benefits accruing from&#13;
more extensive utilization of specialized equipment are not an adeqtiate basis&#13;
for such intervention because they ignore the coordination costs. Those&#13;
coordination costs may explain some of the following phenomena.&#13;
Despite efforts to foster subcontracting in the late 1960s, the&#13;
largest Indian machine-tool producer purchased only 10 percent of its inputs&#13;
externally; for one Western European collaborator the comparable figure&#13;
was 40 percent (Frankena 1971). Similarly, of about 250 suppliers of com-&#13;
ponents to the Indian textile-machinery industry, only ten produced high-&#13;
quality components, primarily in collaboration with companies in developed&#13;
countries (World Bank 1975). 1/ The additional costs incurred by an LDC&#13;
sector characterized by large firms and limited subcontracting will clearly&#13;
be substantial in relation to those of more specialized sectors in developing&#13;
countries. 2/&#13;
Although the sectorwide loss in potential cost reduction is widely&#13;
recognized, effective solutions have not been designed. But without availing&#13;
themselves of subcontracting and the real external economies bestowed upon&#13;
the industry as a whole, LDC machine-producing sectors are subject to an&#13;
immediate cost handicap in relation to their competitors in developed coun-&#13;
tries. 3/ This may nevertheless be the best the sectors can do, given their&#13;
limited organizational ability.&#13;
1/   Also see Pakistan (1976), vol. 2, p. 103.&#13;
2/   As the study of foundries in India shows, import restrictions may also&#13;
encourage internal production of components most cheaply secured abroad&#13;
(World Bank 1974a). See the subsection on government policies below.&#13;
3/   An excellent discussion of conditions that may have fostered the&#13;
evolution of subcontracting in Japan can be found in Watanabe (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Related to the weakness of subcontracting networks is the absence&#13;
of an ability to rebuild equipment. That ability increases productivity&#13;
because the cost of rebuilding typically is low relative to the price of&#13;
new machines. Furthermore the productivity of older equipment can be raised&#13;
to high levels with the additions of features newly available.&#13;
In many cases rebuilding does not involve going&#13;
back to the original design; there are often&#13;
possibilities for adding gauges or precision&#13;
accessories, and in the process the quality of&#13;
the machine will be upgraded and its performance&#13;
characteristics will be significantly improved&#13;
(World Bank 1978, p. 85).&#13;
Although numerous firms in developed countries specialize in rebuilding,&#13;
there is none in such a country as Korea. Moreover a rebuilding capacity&#13;
would increase the comparative advantage of LDCs in machinery, because the&#13;
activity itself is skill-intensive.&#13;
Backward linkages&#13;
Castings and forgings are principal inputs used by the mechanical-&#13;
engineering sector. The production of these inputs is intensive in skilled&#13;
labor, and mechanization is not economical, except at very high volume. They&#13;
can thus contribute to the competitiveness of the machinery sector if they&#13;
are efficiently produced--that is, at less than c.i.f. prices. 1/ Two sets&#13;
of questions arise about the performance of most LDCs in this production:&#13;
first, narrow questions of intraplant efficiency; second, broad questions&#13;
arising from the complex interventions associated with import substitution.&#13;
1/   This assumes that low-volume, labor-intensive production can result in&#13;
prices competitive with high-volume, mechanized processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
To establish the relative labor intensity of foundry and forging&#13;
operations in LDCs, consider the "typical" fixed capital-labor ratios in India&#13;
and the developed countries: in India it is $3,500 per worker, in the developed&#13;
countries $25,000 per worker (World Bank 1974b). 1/    To the Indian figure must&#13;
be added $3,500 for working capital; a smaller figure is characteristic of&#13;
companies in developed countries. 2/ Nevertheless the total capital-labor&#13;
ratio remains considerably lower, reflecting the lack of conveyors, pusher-type&#13;
induction furnaces, and automated transfer lines. Despite the saving in fixed&#13;
capital of the (quite different) production process, the price of Indian&#13;
forgings similar in quality to imported forgings is, on the average, 50&#13;
percent above the c.i.f. price of comparable imports. Half this difference is&#13;
attributable to factors external to the individual firm: the high price and&#13;
erratic supply of raw materials. 3/ The remainder is attributable to internal&#13;
inefficiency and small production runs (ibid.). It has been calculated that&#13;
Indian foundries and forges--at internationally competitive input prices&#13;
(mainly of iron and steel products) and improved, achievable levels of internal&#13;
efficiency--could sell their products at about 90 percent of the world price,&#13;
thus strengthening the potential competitive position of the machinery sector.&#13;
1/   This comparison does not establish a presumptive case for comparative&#13;
advantage, which depends on the relative factor intensity across sectors&#13;
of the Indian economy.&#13;
2/   The annual turnover of inventories in Indian forges is one to two; for&#13;
companies in developed countries it is six to eight (World Bank 1974b;&#13;
Frankena 1971).&#13;
3/   Steel accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the price of forgings and castings,&#13;
and in the early 1970s India's steel was selling at 50 to 60 percent&#13;
above world prices.   Similarly high costs and their adverse impact are&#13;
found in other country studies:   for examples, that on the manufacturing&#13;
sector in Mexico (World Bank 1977), pp. 20-21, and that on the engineering&#13;
industry in Pakistan (Pakistan 1976), vol. 2, p. 290.&#13;

LDC foundries and forges suffer from technical problems, partly&#13;
as a result of the absence of earlier incentives to learn. One measure of&#13;
the technical obstacles facing even an industry with a long history, such as&#13;
the Indian foundry sector, is an estimate that 65 percent of foundries would&#13;
require more than five years, even with substantial technical aid, to produce&#13;
quality castings at international prices and another 25 percent would require&#13;
from one to five years. Even if these periods could be reduced by more&#13;
competitive pressure, they nevertheless indicate the retardation in learning&#13;
introduced by previous trade restrictions. They also indicate the obstacles&#13;
to establishing an efficient machinery sector, obstacles presented by tech-&#13;
nical difficulties ranging from procuring clean sand to the purity of heating&#13;
material and to the use of unnecessarily large amounts of metal per unit of&#13;
output. 1/ Often the smaller companies simply do not understand enough of&#13;
the production technology to produce high-quality products. To obtain such&#13;
products, larger equipment producers frequently establish captive forges and&#13;
foundries (World Bank 1974b; World Bank 1978).&#13;
1/   See the studies of manufacturing in Mexico (World Bank 1977), vol. 2,&#13;
pp. 13, 14, 18, 19; foundries in India (World Bank 1974a), p. ii; and&#13;
machinery industries in Korea (World Bank 1978), ch. 3. A typical&#13;
finding in the third study is the following: "In Korea it is common to&#13;
find the forging blank weighing two to two-and-a-half pounds per pound&#13;
of the net weight of the forged part. The wastage of material is twice&#13;
or more that occurring with good practice" (ibid., p. 78). Similarly in&#13;
closed die forging there usually is some extra metal (flashing) remaining,&#13;
which is removed with a trimming press. In many Korean forges it was&#13;
noted that the flashing was so thick it could not be shorn and a torch&#13;
was needed. "This is a slow process and leaves the forged part in a very&#13;
rough state so that at the next operation in the machine shop a great&#13;
deal of machine time is necessary in order to put the part into finished&#13;
shape" (ibid.). One interesting possibility noted in the study of&#13;
technical development in Argentina is that a faster technical upgrading&#13;
may occur if supplier industries initially sell to high-quality producers&#13;
of consumer durables such as automobile manufacturers (Cortes 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Government policies&#13;
Superimposed on the technical difficulties faced by a young&#13;
mechanical-engineering sector may be additional difficulties induced by a&#13;
policy designed to foster that sector's development. For example, in Korea&#13;
and Mexico there has been an early emphasis on the encouragement of large-scale&#13;
firms by using a variety of incentives, including low-interest loans and such&#13;
favorable tax provisions as accelerated depreciation and investment credits.&#13;
The outcome has been the purchase of equipment that is severalfold too large&#13;
for the domestic market: although medium-sized firms may initially possess&#13;
equipment that will be efficiently used with a doubling of demand, the larger&#13;
machines may be initially used at a tenth of their capacity. Production is&#13;
then saddled with high fixed costs, and an attempt is made to diversify the&#13;
product range. This diversification often competes with the product lines of&#13;
smaller and medium-scale firms, reducing the size of their production runs.&#13;
There may thus be a downward filtration of excess capacity and a loss of the&#13;
benefits of whatever specialization has occurred, increasing production&#13;
costs for smaller firms. 1/ Although this phenomenon is not limited to&#13;
the mechanical-engineering sector, it is more significant than in the process&#13;
industries, given the much larger range of products which can be manufactured&#13;
with a given set of equipment and the larger set-up costs for each run.&#13;
Another policy-induced difficulty affecting the productivity of the&#13;
machinery-producing sector arises from the appeal of restricting imports of&#13;
1/   Once the large-scale capacity is in place, the social costs of producing&#13;
a given level of output may be lower as a result of filtration: that is,&#13;
the reduction in costs by larger firms may exceed the increase imposed&#13;
on the smaller ones. The critical point is that sectorwide costs are&#13;
unnecessarily high as a result of the premature introduction of large-&#13;
scale equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
machine tools in the early stages of growth of the typical capital-goods&#13;
sector. One of the main requirements of an efficient capacity to produce&#13;
capital goods is the use of machine tools of reasonably high quality: that&#13;
is, cutters and shapers of metal which are used in the production of all&#13;
equipment. Machine tools are one of the earliest types of capital-goods&#13;
production begun in LDCs now exhibiting relatively high levels of engineering&#13;
output. They are a tempting target for import substitution, given the large&#13;
quantities imported; some types of machine tool, such as simple lathes and&#13;
presses, are fairly easy to produce and can be used in repair work outside the&#13;
equipment-producing sector and in the production of other machines. But the&#13;
locally produced tools often are not adequate for the high precision charac-&#13;
terizing much of the equipment-producing sector. This inadequacy not present&#13;
a problem as long as imported machine tools are available. But in some&#13;
countries the pressure from domestic machine-tool producers or the desire of&#13;
government to foster the more rapid growth of heavy industry has led to the&#13;
licensing of all machine-tool imports. 1/ Indeed government intervention&#13;
most often leads to the initiation of production of more complex machine-tool&#13;
production.&#13;
The import of machine tools often is permitted only when domestic&#13;
producers certify their inability to produce the imports proposed. Under&#13;
such a policy, machine-tool purchasers attempt to maintain an ability to&#13;
import, while producers are likely to argue that they can match the foreign&#13;
1/   Frankena (1971) cites a number of examples of mechanical-engineering&#13;
firms in India which undertake extensive modification of existing tools&#13;
or complete production of new machine tools because of the inability to&#13;
import specialized tools. Marny similar examples can be found in other&#13;
countries. Such activities can offset to varying degrees the adverse&#13;
impact of import restriction. For evidence in the nonengineering sectors,&#13;

product. In their anxiousness to encourage new production, some governments&#13;
may lend more weight to the claims of producers, at least until the effects&#13;
on purchasers become apparent. In the interim the resulting inability to&#13;
obtain high quality equipment may retard growth in sectors outside the machine-&#13;
tool sector. In such sectors many items are simpler to produce than machine&#13;
tools, and those items enjoy a comparative advantage relative to machine&#13;
tools. 1/ The growth of the entire mechanical-engineering sector may thus be&#13;
slowed by the premature emphasis on machine tools. 2/&#13;
The effect of restrictions on the import of equipment can be seen in&#13;
the following description of conditions in Indian textile-machine production:&#13;
With few exceptions, machine tools and equipment&#13;
are 10-25 years old and in poor condition due to&#13;
both difficulty of importing spare parts and bad&#13;
maintenance. This is particularly so in the heavy&#13;
machine tool sectors where little if any replacement&#13;
has taken place. Single purpose, non-automatic&#13;
light machine tools dominate throughout, with con-&#13;
sequently variable operator workmanship. In the early&#13;
1950s, when most Indian firms commenced manufacture,&#13;
machinery was of low speed simple construction and&#13;
had remained virtually unchanged for the previous 50&#13;
years. for these models, and with abundant cheap labor,&#13;
the original machine tools were adequate. In the&#13;
early 1960s there was a revolution in textile machinery&#13;
design leading to machines 3-4 times faster than 1950&#13;
models.  Within a few years this sophistication in&#13;
design had out-moded all existing machine tools, as&#13;
tolerance became critical, and extensive investment&#13;
in re-tooling became the order of the day in Europe&#13;
1/   Those items require less fine tolerances and less knowledge of metal-&#13;
lurgical properties.&#13;
2/   This problem is similar, of course, to that in other industries in&#13;
which inefficient, protected domestic intermediates reduce the com-&#13;
petitiveness of efficient purchasing industries. The difference is&#13;
that poor equipment leads to long-term handicaps, even if the trade&#13;
regime is liberalized. In contrast, liberalization, say, of textiles&#13;
can have an immediate effect on clothing costs.&#13;

and Japan. Indian textile machinery makers did not&#13;
follow suit and today expect to manufacture modern&#13;
products with obsolete machinery. This leads to lower&#13;
quality. In a larger number of cases rejection rates&#13;
are reportedly so high, that unless defects are over-&#13;
looked and faulty parts used, production would be&#13;
halted. The sad state of machinery has a disastrous&#13;
cascading effect. Varying tolerance and modest opera-&#13;
tional ability necessitates intensive inspection.&#13;
Usually costly remedial action has to be taken to patch&#13;
up machines. Most machines have to be erected in plant&#13;
and far too much filing was undertaken to ensure that&#13;
all the parts fit. The lack of standardization is also&#13;
a constant concern for textile mills since it is very&#13;
difficult to find spare parts that fit their machinery&#13;
(World Bank 1975, pp. 20-21).&#13;
Conclusions about comparative cost structures&#13;
The foregoing discussion of technological difficulties suggests&#13;
that the low efficiency wages of LDC equipment producers are likely to be&#13;
offset, at least partly, by a variety of inefficiencies related to production.&#13;
It also suggests that the establishment of an integrated equipment sector,&#13;
rather than a fabrication sector, is likely to be considerably more difficult&#13;
than envisioned by those calling for the end of dependence on imported&#13;
equipment and the technology it embodies. The establishment of that sector&#13;
nevertheless is possible.&#13;
In general the country studies surveyed in this paper suggest,&#13;
despite the factors which decrease plantwide productivity per day, that the&#13;
wage cost per unit of production in many products appears to be less in LDCs&#13;
than in the developed countries. Whether this is sufficient to achieve a&#13;
static cost advantage is not always clear. The following framework is useful&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
for integrating many of the preceding strands into an arithmetically consistent&#13;
framework. Denote the price of a machine by:&#13;
(1)                         p = Z W + pkk + pmm,&#13;
where z, k, and m are the labor, equipment and material (measured in physical&#13;
units) input per unit of output and w, Pk, and p     are the prices of these&#13;
inputs. Let the subscript 2 represent a developed country and the subscript 1&#13;
an LDC. Then the difference in price is:&#13;
(2)     P2 - P1 = (z2w2 - zI1w) + (k2pk     - klpk ) + (m2pm- mPm) and&#13;
2         1         21&#13;
(3)  (p2 - Pd)/p1 = [z2w2/zIw1) - 1JwI + [(k2pk /klpk)        1]k1+ [(m2Pm2 /m1PM) I     ]&#13;
where w1 = zIwI/p1 and similar terms represent the share in unit cost of each&#13;
of the factors of production in the LDC. Equation 2 simply shows that the&#13;
relative price of the product in two countries depends on relative physical&#13;
productivity, z2/z1, and relative factor prices, w2/w .&#13;
The evidence suggests that for products in which LDCs currently&#13;
are competitive, that competitiveness is attributable to w1/w2 &lt; z2/z1--that&#13;
is, the difference in the relative wage is smaller than the difference in&#13;
the relative productivity of labor.    On the other hand, Pk    is greater than&#13;
1Pk&#13;
Pk because interest costs in LDCs typically exceed those in the developed&#13;
2&#13;
countries, while the k2/k1 relation is ambiguous.     LDCs may use less expen-&#13;
sive general-purpose equipment, but their rates of capacity use are lower for&#13;
reasons set out earlier. 1/ Moreover, because of greater external uncertainties,&#13;
1/   Clearly the forgone interest component of capital cost occurs regardless&#13;
of utilization rates. Whether depreciation charges do so as well depends&#13;
on whether depreciation is attributable to obsolescence or actual use.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
requirements for working capital may be higher. In addition, most of the&#13;
evidence suggests that material costs per unit of output are somewhat higher&#13;
because of the lower physical productivity and higher unit costs of material&#13;
in LDCs.&#13;
To illustrate some of the foregoing numerically, I present data&#13;
about three groups of Indian textile machinery producers exhibiting high,&#13;
intermediate, and low efficiency as reflected by their unit costs (table 3). 1/&#13;
The firms are described as respectively using: modern manufacturing methods,&#13;
including training, layout, and equipment of recent vintage; 1940-to-1960&#13;
vintage equipment and methods to produce reasonably up-to-date equipment;&#13;
1940-vintage equipment to produce 1950 style textile equipment. The machinery&#13;
produced by the first two groups is fairly similar and sells for roughly the&#13;
same price; that produced by the third group, as would be expected, sells for&#13;
a lower price.&#13;
The evidence must be considered from the perspective of both the&#13;
producer and the purchaser. First, consider the producer. The most striking&#13;
difference among firms is the large variation in labor costs attributable to&#13;
differences in better equipment per worker--they are only partly offset by the&#13;
higher depreciation changes--and to differences in layout, scheduling, and so&#13;
on. The study indicates that variations also exist in the producitivity of&#13;
labor in specific tasks, which reflects the more intensive training in the&#13;
efficient group. That group also exhibits lower material costs. Furthermore,&#13;
interest charges are greater in the less efficient firms, despite their lower&#13;
fixed-capital intensity. Although this may be attributable to the more&#13;

reliable supply sources of the efficient firms and their reduced need for&#13;
inventories, it also is likely that the lower interest charges reflect smaller&#13;
work-in-process inventories achieved by superior management.&#13;
The private profitability of the efficient firms appears to be&#13;
high, as is evidenced by the ratio of profit to sales, but given the absence&#13;
of the respective capital-output ratios, this is not certain. The general&#13;
significance of these cost comparisons is that inefficient production largely&#13;
erodes the potential cost advantages conferred by low wages of skilled labor.&#13;
The social inefficiency of the third set of firms and its product&#13;
cannot be inferred from the data. To establish this inefficiency would&#13;
require knowledge of the status of the textile producers using each type of&#13;
equipment. It is possible that manufacturers adopting 1950-vintage equipment&#13;
exhibit lower production costs, given the structure of input prices. Or, put&#13;
another way, 1970-design machines may not be the least-cost method for at least&#13;
some of the firms within the industry.&#13;

The same source provides another useful set of comparisons that&#13;
allow some inferences about the cost competitiveness an LDC firm is likely&#13;
to enjoy if it can largely eliminate x-inefficiency and operate at the inter-&#13;
national production frontier. This condition is satisfied by a Swiss textile-&#13;
machinery producer and its Indian licensee. Both produce similar equipment:&#13;
the Swiss firm is internationally competitive; the Indian firm has benefited&#13;
from a detailed and rigorous training program, so that its productive effic-&#13;
iency is, by a substantial margin, the highest among the large number of&#13;
Indian textile-machinery producers. The figures in table 4 show a cost&#13;
comparison for a "typical" machine produced by both firms.&#13;

steel in relation to European steel at the time of the analysis. Even with&#13;
basic metals at world prices, however, the Indian firm would continue to&#13;
enjoy a cost advantage because of the lower costs of its efficient casting&#13;
and forging suppliers. The data reflect the classical argument for the com-&#13;
petitiveness of LDC equipment producers: the Indian plant is considerably&#13;
less mechanized, as is evidenced by the combined depreciation and interest&#13;
charges; it uses at least 50 percent more labor in production. But the&#13;
Indian wage level is less than a tenth that of the Swiss, and an intensive&#13;
training program has resulted in high labor productivity and hence a low&#13;
efficiency wage. Nevertheless, when the price difference of the final&#13;
product is disaggregated according to equation 3, costs of direct labor&#13;
at most account for 10 percent of the final price difference; differences in&#13;
costs of material and capital each account for roughly half the remaining&#13;
difference. 1/&#13;
EVIDENCE OF DESIGN ADAPTATION TO DOMESTIC FACTOR PROPORTIONS&#13;
Before proceeding to the evidence, I will briefly discuss some of the issues&#13;
related to innovation. The market wage-rental ratio, however distorted it may&#13;
be relative to a social optimum, is considerably lower in the principal LDCs&#13;
producing equipment than in the developed countries. If it is assumed that&#13;
purchasers of equipment are interested in reducing their production costs, the&#13;
derived demand for locally produced machinery should lead to equipment and&#13;
processes that are more labor-intensive. Nevertheless the rather thin&#13;
evidence on the existence and extent of adaptation of designs by LDC capital-&#13;
goods producers does not verify this expectation. The alternative for&#13;
1/   Nonproduction salaries are much lower in India, but this holds for all&#13;
sectors and confers no specific advantage on capital-goods suppliers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
responding to local factor prices--production of vintages of equipment no&#13;
longer produced by more advanced countries--is more widely confirmed, but&#13;
here, too, the evidence is sparse. Both mechanisms for adjusting to different&#13;
relative factor prices are discussed together, though there are important&#13;
differences between them.&#13;
There are two sets of evidence on which to draw. First, there&#13;
are detailed studies of particular LDC sectors, such as the Indian textile-&#13;
machinery industry. Because these are focused on machine production, con-&#13;
siderable information is available about the character and significance&#13;
of technical design changes of the final product as well as the production&#13;
of older designs, usually under license. These studies tend to focus on&#13;
larger producers, about which more is known. Thus any inferences drawn are&#13;
perforce limited to this class of firm. A second set of studies describes the&#13;
design activities of LDC equipment producers as a byproduct of other interests,&#13;
including analysis of export performance, the choice of technique in machine-&#13;
using industries, and the efficiency of small-scale enterprises. 1/ Neither&#13;
set is systematic in product coverage or in evaluating the economic signifi-&#13;
cance of design changes. They consequently permit only tentative inferences.&#13;
I shall limit my discussion of design adaptation to major changes&#13;
in the factor proportions that characterize equipment produced by LDC firms.&#13;
Other types of innovation, such as increased efficiency of material use or&#13;
adaptation to local materials, are important as well. Indeed numerous small&#13;
innovations that reduce the input requirement per unit of output, regardless&#13;
of their factor bias, may ultimately be of greater economic significance. The&#13;
1/   See Pack (1979) for a discussion of LDC-produced equipment in a context&#13;
of the choice of technique.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
two types of innovation are undoubtedly related. 1/ In a somewhat different&#13;
vein, if LDC producers replicate the equipment of developed countries at lower&#13;
prices, a reduction in capital intensity is thereby achieved. These extended&#13;
issues require separate treatment, however, and there currently is little&#13;
systematic evidence on them.&#13;
The predominance of information on the activities of large producers&#13;
almost certainly introduces a bias toward observing limited adaptation of&#13;
factor proportions. Purchasers of their equipment are likely to produce for&#13;
the protected segment of the domestic market; they consequently face weaker&#13;
incentives to obtain the cost advantage that more labor-intensive equipment&#13;
would confer. In addition, larger machine-producing firms often receive&#13;
their designs through licensing. These two aspects of the demand and supply&#13;
of designs are related. It is unlikely that such extensive use of labor-&#13;
saving designs of developed countries would be profitable if the ultimate&#13;
users faced more competitive markets. In turn, the availability of those&#13;
designs and the higher costs associated with their use may have generated&#13;
pressures for protection.&#13;
Smaller producers of equipment are more likely to sell to firms&#13;
facing competitive factor and product markets and, as a result, to undertake&#13;
greater adaptation of imported designs or to produce their own. Thus the&#13;
following summary, which often is pessimistic about the ability of LDCs to&#13;
engage in factor adaptation and their interest in that ability, may be too&#13;
gloomy, because efforts of small firms may have been overlooked. 2/ In a&#13;
1/   David (1975) presents a stimulating discussion of this and other related&#13;
issues.&#13;
2/   A fascinating account of an indigenous Indian tractor design, and the&#13;
many bureaucratic obstacles it encountered, is provided by Bhatt (1977).&#13;

different environment for larger firms, more appropriate machinery might be&#13;
forthcoming. As I will argue below, this outcome is far from inevitable.&#13;
Production can conveniently be classified by the source of design.&#13;
Large firms tend to rely on licenses; smaller firms on copying existing&#13;
equipment. Licensed production of unaltered equipment will broaden the&#13;
spectrum of choice over time of choice if the LDC firms do not modify their&#13;
initial designs when the licensor does. Two Indian loom producers offer&#13;
an example: one manufactured a Swiss automatic loom of the late 1950s and&#13;
early 1960s; the' second a semiautomatic loom according to a 1950 Japanese&#13;
design. The price of the semiautomatic loom was about 35 percent of that of&#13;
the locally produced automatic loom, which in turn was cheaper than Western&#13;
European looms then available (World Bank 1975). The purchase by local firms&#13;
of these looms rather than more modern ones is attributable to two circum-&#13;
stances: the sporadic availability of the high-quality yarn necessary to&#13;
realize the fast speeds of more modern looms; the lower initial equipment cost&#13;
and low wages in the cotton-textile sector. Similarly, South Korean companies&#13;
continue to produce semiautomatic looms, which are extensively used in the&#13;
domestic textile industry to produce for both the export and domestic&#13;
markets. 1/&#13;
Relying solely on equipment of older vintage, though an important&#13;
option for producers in the short or intermediate term, has important limita-&#13;
tions. Continued design improvement by machine producers in the developed&#13;
countries, not at least partly offset by similar activity in the LDCs, may&#13;
1/   These are not produced under license but are a slightly modified version&#13;
of an earlier Japanese design. See Rhee and Westphal (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
lead to a situation of technical dominance in which the equipment produced&#13;
in developed countries is less expensive to use, regardless of relative factor&#13;
prices. But reductions that can be achieved in the cost of production by&#13;
eliminating some of the inefficiencies discussed in the preceding section may&#13;
permit price reductions that allow LDC-produced equipment to continue to be&#13;
competitive for a longer period.&#13;
Design research may be less important for smaller local producers&#13;
that typically do not rely on licensing. Their evolution may reflect the&#13;
differences in creative ability as well as their links to the more competi-&#13;
tive sectors of the economy. There are a number of instances of companies&#13;
modifying imported designs, upgrading them, and producing a machine that&#13;
permits a lower capital-labor ratio in the using sector. For example,&#13;
Argentine companies are currently producing food-processing equipment that is&#13;
less mechanized than advanced-country equipment designed for the same product;&#13;
so are a number of Pakistani companies (Cortes 1978; Pakistan 1976). In these&#13;
two instances there unfortunately is no evidence of whether the adapted&#13;
equipment is economically efficient. Other pieces of evidence indicate that&#13;
smaller firms in many countries, usually not manufacturing under license, have&#13;
produced simple equipment that often is used for the production of goods&#13;
whose quality is too low for international trade. 1/&#13;
1/   See Bell (1978), Child and Kaneda (1971), Cooper and Kaplinsky (1974),&#13;
Johnston and Kilby (1975), Kaneda (1971), Pakistan (1976), Smith (n.d.),&#13;
and Timmer (1972). Many of these illustrations, such as the Child-Kaneda&#13;
documentation of the production of small engines and other equipment in&#13;
response to demands generated by the green revolution, reflect limited&#13;
adaptation of design, but confirm the existence of considerable small-&#13;
scale engineering ability. The most thorough study of adaptation by&#13;
small-scale producers is that of Bell on Thailand's generation of locally&#13;
adapted cassava-processing equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
What, then, is the evidence? In a systematic series of studies of&#13;
alternative production methods that could be used to alter factor proportions--&#13;
studies carried out by the Livingstone Institute at the University of&#13;
Strathclyde--LDC-produced equipment provides a principal source of the&#13;
increased range of choice in only a few sectors, most notably in maize&#13;
milling. 1/ In others, most of the central processing equipment was designed&#13;
and produced in developed countries, though some of the simpler structural&#13;
components of the production process, such as vats, were locally manufactured.&#13;
Moreover, in other studies of the choice of technique, the expansion of the&#13;
range of choice arises from currently produced Japanese equipment or older&#13;
vintages from developed countries, but rarely from LDC production.&#13;
Although the evidence is far from extensive, the ability and&#13;
interest in major design alterations--to increase labor intensity or to&#13;
augment the efficiency of labor-intensive alternatives--does not charac-&#13;
terize most LDC capital-goods producers. This characteristic undoubtedly&#13;
is partly related to the more general absence of research activity, which&#13;
will be discussed below. In addition, it may reflect the fact that most&#13;
of the principal LDC producers have pursued policies of intensive import&#13;
substitution, which may well have decreased the derived demand for adapted&#13;
machinery.&#13;
A comparison of textile-machinery production in Korea and India is&#13;
instructive in assessing the effect of differences in derived demand. Both&#13;
countries have a fairly substantial capacity to produce textile machinery,&#13;
with India's spanning a broader spectrum from spinning to finishing. Korea&#13;
produces semiautomatic and simple automatic looms; the principal Indian firms&#13;

no. 10 (October 1977).&#13;

manufacture modern labor-saving equipment. This discrepancy can be plausibly&#13;
attributed to the protected position of Indian textile producers, whereas&#13;
the Korean textile industry has been export-oriented from its inception.&#13;
Although there is limited pressure on Indian producers to reduce costs&#13;
by using more labor-intensive equipment, the pressure is greater on Korean&#13;
producers, who in turn demand labor-intensive equipment.&#13;
It is not possible, by using existing sources, to pursue this&#13;
hypothesis much further. Korea's machinery sector is too recent in origin and&#13;
produces too small a range of products to allow any more general verification.&#13;
A closer look at the sources of equipment for other rapidly growing export&#13;
industries would be of considerable interest. It should be noted, however,&#13;
that the Korean loom manufacturers have used conveniently available Japanese&#13;
models as the basis of their design. They have not engaged in research on&#13;
local adaptations of design. So far there is limited evidence of such activ-&#13;
ity, but its potential emergence provides a strong rationale for the encour-&#13;
agement of the machinery sector.&#13;
SOME HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE RESEARCH PROCESS&#13;
There are numerous descriptions but few systematic studies of the extent or&#13;
absence of research on design in the capital-goods sector and other sectors of&#13;
the LDCs here considered. The most general impression conveyed by the existing&#13;
studies is the absence of product research; but this impression may partly&#13;
reflect the disproportionate attention analysts have given to publicly funded&#13;
research institutes, in contrast with the activities of firms. 1/ The limited&#13;
evidence on firms suggests that if a research staff exists, it most often is&#13;
1/ Crane (1977) presents a fairly complete bibliography.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
devoted to questions not related to design. 1/ If this is assumed to be the&#13;
case, some tentative exploration of the reasons for the pattern may be useful.&#13;
The pursuit of import substitution may discourage design efforts but&#13;
encourage other cost-reducing activities. Because of the restrictions on&#13;
imports, the unpredictability of licensing procedures, and the insistence that&#13;
firms achieve specified levels of domestic content, it may be profitable to&#13;
employ research personnel in three activities: identifying local sources of&#13;
raw and intermediate materials; identifying and upgrading potential local&#13;
suppliers; and improving technical processes within the firm. In fact these&#13;
are reported to be principal activities of many engineers and technicians&#13;
employed in research and development. 2/ But if a firm has a research budget,&#13;
the allocation to that budget should equate the marginal return from design&#13;
with the return obtainable from responding to policies for import substitution.&#13;
There is little reason to believe that the marginal returns from the latter&#13;
systematically exceed the former. Other explanations are needed. 3/&#13;
1/   See Cortes (1978), Frankena (1971), Katz and Ablin (1978), Pakistan&#13;
(1976), and World Bank (1975 and 1977). Among the representative facts&#13;
gleaned from these descriptions are the following: only one Indian&#13;
textile machinery producer spent as much as 1 percent of its sales&#13;
receipts on research and development; a 1965 survey indicated that only 5&#13;
percent of Indian licensees engaged in any development activity and that&#13;
only 2 percent engaged in more general research (Frankena 1971). There&#13;
are exceptions. Some Argentine firms engage in design (Katz and Ablin&#13;
1978). Similarly a small number of Indian firms conduct research for&#13;
other purposes--for example, to allow a cotton ring frame to be used for&#13;
worsted spinning --as well as adapt equipment to perform under conditions&#13;
of high humidity (World Bank 1975).&#13;
2/   For example, one of the largest Indian machine tool producers employs&#13;
250 engineers and scientists, yet produces virtually no design work of&#13;
its own (Frankena 1971).&#13;
3/   Although it might be argued that an export orientation is conducive&#13;
to design research, the principal exporting countries have until recently&#13;
emphasized relatively simple, labor-intensive products not requiring an&#13;
intensive design effort. Whether the increasing emphasis of the East&#13;
Asian countries on engineering products will be accompanied by a local&#13;
design effort or by reliance on licenses still is unclear. In existing&#13;
technology-based industries producing mainly for the local market, such&#13;
as chemicals, the emphasis has mainly been on licensing. For an example&#13;
see World Bank (1978), ch. 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
In its simplest form a firm's calculation of whether to allocate&#13;
some of its research budget to design should weigh the costs of achieving&#13;
a given objective by carrying out its own research--say, meeting the com-&#13;
petition of a new design from the developed countries--against those of&#13;
acquisition through licensing. The ability to evaluate correctly the wisdom&#13;
of licensing as opposed to own research will depend on some prior experience&#13;
in research to allow the calculation of the likely costs of internal develop-&#13;
ment. Familiarity with the relevant licensing options and their evaluation&#13;
will also depend on a strong technical and economic staff, whose skills may&#13;
be a function of previous research. Thus even the simple choice just cited&#13;
between licensing and own research undoubtedly is too simple: it ignores&#13;
even the investment required to structure the decision correctly.&#13;
In the light of scale economies in research, the relative endowments&#13;
of research personnel and hardware in LDCs and in developed countries, and&#13;
their probable relative efficiency as a result of previous learning, a one-&#13;
time objective--say, in response to a major new design innovation--is likely&#13;
to be achieved most cheaply through licensing. In general a firm will have to&#13;
respond to a stream of ongoing innovations. For the optimal strategy, it must&#13;
not only consider the simple tradeoff associated with current costs of acquisi-&#13;
tion of a license in relation to internal research 1/. It must also consider&#13;
1/   The research decision in an export-oriented economy would differ only&#13;
insofar as the licensing costs would be higher, given the threat to&#13;
third-country markets. This may force firms in such countries as Taiwan&#13;
and Korea to pursue a local technical capacity in engineering rather&#13;
earlier than did such large import-substituting countries as India and&#13;
Brazil. Until exporting countries enter more sophisticated industries in&#13;
which competition is based upon design, it may well be optimal for them&#13;
to delay research and emphasize cheaper, labor-intensive products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
the effect of current research on the cost and effectiveness of future&#13;
research. 1/ The current paucity of research may be attributable to the&#13;
myopia of firms, to the capital market imperfections facing even the largest&#13;
LDC firms, and to risk aversion. Public intervention to foster local tech-&#13;
nical development can be justified on all of these grounds. There neverthe-&#13;
less is the possibility that LDCs may suffer from a comparative disadvantage&#13;
in research and development, and the case for public aid should plausibly&#13;
demonstrate that the appropriately discounted value of benefits from the local&#13;
effort will exceed the discounted costs. The benefits should be defined to&#13;
include additional income obtainable from the given investment if the local&#13;
sector produces more appropriate equipment than suppliers in developed coun-&#13;
tries. If technical independence is viewed as a good in itself, no such&#13;
calculation need be made, though I suspect that behind such views lies the&#13;
intuition that infant-industry arguments about technology development are&#13;
valid.&#13;
If the foregoing sketch of the probable effects of the overhang&#13;
in developed countries of a large body of innovations and effectiveness in&#13;
generating further ones is even roughly correct, the relatively small amount&#13;
of design research in the engineering sectors of LDCs becomes easier to&#13;
understand. It also would help to explain the paucity of labor-using innova-&#13;
tions: a firm successfully undertaking such research, which increases the&#13;
present discounted value of a given machine in the user-industry may find its&#13;
competitive edge removed by rivals that purchase licenses that increase the&#13;
1/   Mansfield and others (1977) have recently produced estimates showing&#13;
that research and development costs per project are negatively related&#13;
to experience. If this relation were more generally confirmed, it&#13;
would support an infant-industry view of research and development.&#13;

present discounted value of their equipment. 1/ A labor-using adaptation&#13;
might be matched by a rival's ability to incorporate material-saving features&#13;
or higher speeds. The rival need not compete in labor-saving. Although a&#13;
complete analysis would depend on the license fees, the "shelf" of licenses&#13;
available in developed countries, and the intensity and bias of innovation by&#13;
the local firm, it is possible that successful local innovators would not&#13;
realize greater profits from adaptive research. 2/&#13;
REQUIREMENTS OF COST EFFICIENCY AND DESIGN INNOVATION&#13;
The long-term competitiveness of LDC capital-goods producers depends on activi-&#13;
ties related to two capacities: reducing excess production costs attributable&#13;
to the types of inefficiencies cited earlier; undertaking research and partic-&#13;
ularly altering designs. Research to reduce the production costs of an&#13;
unchanged product usually is termed process research; efforts to alter design,&#13;
product research. In the production of equipment the two are related because&#13;
process research, by lowering the price of a machine of given design, alters&#13;
the technical choices facing purchasers. Some recent accounts of the experience&#13;
of Latin American industrial producers, all in the nonengineering sectors,&#13;
document considerable process innovation. 3/ If this is found to characterize&#13;
the engineering sector as well, it is of some importance because declines in&#13;
the price of capital goods constitute a capital-saving phenomenon for the&#13;
entire economy.&#13;
1/   See Baldwin and Childs (1969) for an explicit model of this type.&#13;
2/   Government intervention may also discourage innovation.   For example,&#13;
in India it became difficult to obtain a license to manufacture a new&#13;
product without a prior arrangement with a foreign technical colla-&#13;
borator. Similarly it was difficult to obtain foreign exchange for&#13;
the import of prototypes or for travel to trade fairs (Frankena 1971).&#13;
3/   For an example see Katz and Ablin (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Some of the excess production costs attributable to inefficiencies&#13;
will be ameliorated simply through greater experience and a growing level of&#13;
output; others will require special efforts. Labor productivity on set tasks&#13;
with given equipment is likely to improve over time; a number of studies have&#13;
demonstrated that the physical labor input per unit of output in the engineer-&#13;
ing sector declines with cumulative experience. 1/ Plantwide productivity&#13;
should also grow as a consequence of an increase in the output of individual&#13;
plants, assuming that this increase permits greater utilization of special&#13;
equipment and labor. In addition, augmented organizational experience should&#13;
increase the ability of both the firm and the sector to gain from subcontracting.&#13;
On the other hand x-inefficient practices--the absence of conversion&#13;
guides for machine operators, the misuse of existing machinery, and the prob-&#13;
lems of layout--are likely to require explicit expenditure to obtain the&#13;
requisite knowledge. Although competitive pressure can provide a more&#13;
receptive atmosphere for the diffusion of the improved practice, attention&#13;
to improving the institutional mechanisms will shorten the learning process.&#13;
Reducing these performance gaps requires visits to foreign plants, the use of&#13;
external consultants, and the upgrading of both firm level and industrywide&#13;
research organizations to augment the knowledge of best practice. 2/&#13;
1/   Among the relevant studies are those of Alchian (1963), David (1975),&#13;
Dudley (1970), Hirsch (1952), and Oi (1967). Whether experience is best&#13;
viewed as the sum of previous physical production or the time since&#13;
production began remains an open question. See, for example, David&#13;
(1975) and Fellner (1969). In addition to learning by-doing, task-level&#13;
productivity will also improve as some current productivity-depressing&#13;
practices, such as the use of limited numbers of special tools, represent&#13;
an optimal adjustment to existing factor prices. As wage-rental ratios&#13;
grow, the induced increases in capital-labor ratios will result in&#13;
greater labor productivity but not necessarily in reduced average costs.&#13;
2/   Often the best practice exhibits no factor-saving bias--low-cost cutting&#13;
blades and coolants are examples--and its adoption is warranted regardless&#13;
of local relative factor prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
In the longer term the LDC producer must compete not only in cost&#13;
but in design. The engineering sector in developing countries engages in&#13;
a considerable amount of research. This leads to a steady flow of improve-&#13;
ments which reduce operating costs at the input prices in developed countries.&#13;
Such alterations are relevant to LDC producers, particularly those producing&#13;
equipment under license. The licensee generally will not be able to obtain&#13;
complete information on new improvements that the licensor makes to enhance&#13;
the performance of equipment, often without an increase in price. Moreover&#13;
these improvements frequently are not labor-saving in the sense of requiring&#13;
fewer workers per machine. Instead the speed of the machine or its efficiency&#13;
in using materials is increased. Depending on the price of the newer machine,&#13;
potential buyers may prefer the newer design because a given investment&#13;
expenditure will result in a larger present discounted value. Thus, even if&#13;
the LDC firms initially can match or undercut the international price, there&#13;
is an inexorable attenuation of their initial cost advantage, unless their&#13;
product is upgraded.&#13;
The difficulties posed by the need for product upgrading are&#13;
not, of course, specific to the capital-goods sector. Any commodity whose&#13;
characteristics are constantly being changed will face the same difficul-&#13;
ties. This, then, is another problem in comparative advantage, which includes&#13;
research ability among the endowments. Product-cycle theorists who have&#13;
considered similar questions typically conclude that, after the technical&#13;
shakedown and the routinization of production, a country's comparative&#13;
advantage in traditional factors will eventually determine the efficiency&#13;
of production. The difference, however, between the goods considered by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
the product-cycle model and that of capital equipment is important. In the&#13;
first, after an invention occurs, a product with fairly unchanging charac-&#13;
teristics is produced. Once a niche in the structure of consumption is&#13;
established, the consumer product is not quickly replaced. Research in the&#13;
developed countries does not directly undercut its sales, unless very close&#13;
substitutes are produced. On the other hand, newer equipment, producing&#13;
as it does the same output, can completely replace unimproved equipment&#13;
once the present discounted value of the earnings stream of the former exceeds&#13;
that of the latter. Indeed the research-intensive phase early in the product&#13;
cycle continually characterizes the capital-goods producing sector, which is&#13;
innovation-intensive.&#13;
The necessity of newer designs in the longer term is not limited&#13;
to the requirements of the export market. Domestically produced equipment&#13;
may initially be available at lower cost than imported equipment. But if&#13;
foreign companies improve the design of their equipment more rapidly than&#13;
local ones, a point will be reached at which production costs arising from&#13;
the use of locally produced equipment will exceed those associated with&#13;
imported machinery. Unless the domestic engineering sector is protected,&#13;
purchasers will gravitate toward imports, and the sector will exhibit stagnant&#13;
production and excess capacity, much as the Indian textile-machinery sector&#13;
has done. 1/&#13;
1/   For a detailed description of the many types of equipment in which the&#13;
failure to upgrade design has been a deterrent to exports and a cost-&#13;
raising factor for domestic firms forced to rely on such equipment, see&#13;
Frankena (1971), pp. 339-407.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
The need for research is likely to be greater if the LDC industry&#13;
has not adapted the factor proportions of the equipment. The reason is that&#13;
research in developed countries is localized in the more capital-intensive&#13;
part of the isoquant. But even if local designs are used, the need to offset&#13;
the effects of new improvements from abroad will eventually occur. As long as&#13;
domestically produced equipment is used in the production of commodities whose&#13;
production is also possible with imported equipment, efficiency will eventually&#13;
require domestic producers to meet this competition. These considerations can&#13;
be conveniently summarized in figure 1.&#13;

Let A denote the initial unit isoquant in the developed country,&#13;
B the somewhat more labor-intensive isoquant achievable by LDC-produced&#13;
equipment, and w'w the initial wage-rental ratio. Initially minimum costs&#13;
are achieved by producing with type-B equipment. If B remains unchanged,&#13;
while A moves toward the origin as a result of ongoing research, the two&#13;
techniques yield equal costs when AI is reached. 1/ Any further improvement&#13;
leads to type-A equipment's becoming cheaper, even at LDC costs.     It can also&#13;
be seen that if considerably more labor-intensive processes, such as C, are&#13;
available, say reflecting indigenous designs, these will remain competitive&#13;
for a longer time, until A2 is achieved. But even C, an indigenous technique,&#13;
will eventually be displaced, unless it can be improved.&#13;
The role of cost reductions for LDC producers, as opposed to design&#13;
changes, could be shown by a vertical, downward shift in B or C. The lower&#13;
price lengthens the period over which LDC-produced machinery is competitive.&#13;
It also has a second benefit: reducing the capital-labor ratio of equipment&#13;
of a given design.&#13;
Figure 1 can also help to clarify one argument that has been made&#13;
in favor of establishing and strengthening LDC capital-goods production (Pack&#13;
and Todaro 1969).    One of the potential benefits is the ability to produce&#13;
technologies that are outdated in the advanced countries (such as 1960-vintage&#13;
food-processing machinery) but economically efficient in some LDCs, given&#13;
their factor-price configurations. It is plausible that such ability provides&#13;
more control over "technical destiny" than would extensive purchases of used&#13;

equipment, the sole reliance on which would require an importing nation to&#13;
continually modernize its equipment, paralleling the process that occurred,&#13;
say, fifteen years earlier in the advanced country. Premature modernization&#13;
dictated by the diminishing supply of older-vintage equipment, whether new&#13;
or used, will raise production costs in the purchasing country. 1/ Equipment&#13;
built to exploit the cost structure of U.S. manufacturing in 1960 may remain&#13;
too capital-intensive for Tanzania for many years, and a gradual, forced&#13;
modernization increases the discrepancy. Thus LDC production capable of&#13;
replicating earlier vintages presents an attractive potential for achieving&#13;
a desirable rate of technical upgrading. As Figure 1 implies, however, the&#13;
world is not this benign. Unimproved versions of B or C may not be competitive&#13;
for very long, though this is an empirical question about which little is&#13;
known. The desired goal--obtaining some indigenous control over the rate&#13;
of introduction of technology--will surely be conditioned by the continuing&#13;
design progress by equipment producers in developed countries. Without&#13;
significant abilities to reduce costs and achieve design improvements, the&#13;
scope for controlling a nation's technical evolution is limited.&#13;
A simple numerical example helps to illustrate some of the orders&#13;
of magnitude. Assume that equipment types A and B exhibit the following&#13;
1/   This outcome can be seen by assuming that A, B, and C in figure 1 con-&#13;
stitute the production alternatives facing a firm. With the indicated&#13;
factor-price ratio, C is the cost-minimizing technique and is likely&#13;
to represent either an older vintage or a local design. If C were not&#13;
available, B would become the minimum-cost choice but result in higher&#13;
average costs than C.&#13;

A                    4,000             $  400         $4,400&#13;
B                    1,333             $2,000         $3,333&#13;
If type-A equipment, produced in the advanced country, shows a 3 percent&#13;
annual decrease in both capital and labor costs while type-B equipment remains&#13;
unimproved, the total cost of production for the two types would become&#13;
equal after about nine years. But if the capital cost of type-B equipment&#13;
can be reduced by 25 percent, it would remain less expensive to use for an&#13;
additional three-and-a-half years. Gains in internal efficiency clearly can&#13;
delay the day of reckoning, but the absence of research to improve equipment&#13;
limits long-run prospects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Three characteristics affect the determination of the year in&#13;
which the catching up occurs:&#13;
*    The initial capital-labor ratios of the two types of&#13;
equipment.&#13;
e    The relative factor prices paid by potential purchasers.&#13;
e    The relative rates of "net" improvement in equipment per-&#13;
formance: that is, the increase in equipment price minus&#13;
the saving made possible in labor and material inputs.&#13;
If an LDC decides not to compete with the developed countries in their own&#13;
product lines, it should do two things: emphasize machines in which the&#13;
difference in characteristics between its equipment and that of developed&#13;
countries is considerable; search for markets in which the ratio of wages to&#13;
the cost of capital is low. 1/ Even by following this program, however,&#13;
improvements that reduce the cost of using LDC-produced equipment must event-&#13;
ually be generated. Thus, under the optimistic assumptions of our example--no&#13;
wage increase and an initial machine price a third that of the developed-&#13;
country machine--the initial cost advantage is eroded after only nine years&#13;
if no LDC improvements are forthcoming.&#13;
The arithmetic example obscures one critical point about which&#13;
little is known: the development of prices relative to cost-saving charac-&#13;
teristics in the industry in developed countries. If design modifications&#13;
increase the present discounted value of production with a machine because&#13;
productivity improvements are not reflected in commensurate increases in&#13;
the price of equipment, unimproved machines will, other things being equal,&#13;
command a lower price. At the extreme, if the price of equipment of developed&#13;
countries does not increase, the range of effective choice faced by purchas-&#13;
ing industries will be increasingly narrow. Ultimately the equipment of&#13;
1/   It also is desirable to identify sectors in which improvements in the&#13;
characteristics of equipment of developed countries will be limited,&#13;
a recommendation more easily offered than implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
developed countries may dominate that of the LDC. But if the cost of equip-&#13;
ment increases in step with the rise in machine productivity, the LDCs will&#13;
be under less pressure to do research.&#13;
The reason for my earlier emphasis on possible sources of cost&#13;
reduction in LDC equipment production should now be clear. LDC companies may,&#13;
in the absence of a design ability, for a time forestall the loss of compet-&#13;
itiveness by reducing the costs of production through process research. But&#13;
the potential efficiency gains from such improvements incur some costs and&#13;
are exhaustible. Reorganizing the flow of work, improving maintenance, and&#13;
cleaning the sand from casting-shop floors are once-and-for-all changes,&#13;
though they may have large, cost-cutting effects. 1/ Eventually more funda-&#13;
mental efforts will be required to increase competitiveness, particularly by&#13;
design changes. By maintaining short and intermediate term competitiveness,&#13;
however, disembodied efficiency gains can allow the gradual buildup of the&#13;
requisite research capacity. 2/ Building up that capacity of course is a&#13;
major undertaking that ranges from training technical personnel, to estab-&#13;
lishing institutions in which they are usefully employed, to developing&#13;
institutes of weights and measures.&#13;
1/   Continuing process innovation resulting from internal research may also&#13;
occur after the principal flaws are corrected. But there is no reason to&#13;
believe that these will be greater than those in the developed countries.&#13;
2/   Productivity growth may also encourage more research and development&#13;
insofar as lower marginal costs allow firms to increase their quantity&#13;
of output. Larger quantities encourage research and development because&#13;
the benefit of that research and development can be allocated over the&#13;
firm's entire output at zero marginal cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

REQUIREMENTS OF MARKETING EXPORTS&#13;
The focus of the foregoing discussion has been on production in the capital-&#13;
goods sector. Other issues, particularly those associated with marketing,&#13;
have been ignored. For most LDCs, however, exports will be instrumental to&#13;
the development of the sector. For capital goods for which long production&#13;
runs are typical in the developed countries, exports will be necessary to&#13;
achieve economic levels of production; for products for which small batches&#13;
are the rule, exports are desirable to increase the average rate of use of&#13;
productive capacity in the face of fluctuating domestic demand. Furthermore,&#13;
in countries whose success in exporting traditional consumer goods has led to&#13;
increasingly restrictive import policies in purchasing countries, a change to&#13;
a strategy emphasizing engineering products offers an alternative in the&#13;
intermediate term. Indeed, in their most recent plans, Korea and Taiwan&#13;
emphasize the importance of engineering industries as a source of continuing&#13;
rapid rates of export growth.&#13;
Trends in the destination of LDC exports are a bit surprising. For&#13;
the most recent years for which data are available, about half the capital-&#13;
goods exports of LDCs have been to other LDCs, despite the much larger market&#13;
in developed countries. Given my earlier argument, it seems unlikely that&#13;
much of such trade occurs because of the sale of industrial equipment which&#13;
is more appropriate--that is, labor-intensive. Instead it appears that a&#13;
principal reason is the price competitiveness of such standard items as&#13;
valves, ball bearings, and diesel engines included in the "capital goods"&#13;
category. Industrial machinery that has been adapted does not loom large in&#13;
trade between LDCs. Similarly the exports to developed countries seem to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
consist primarily of simple standardized items rather than complex industrial&#13;
machinery.&#13;
The pattern is likely to continue for several years. As was&#13;
seen earlier, research on industrial machinery in the developed countries&#13;
militates against LDC products, though this advantage may well be eroded&#13;
as various countries improve their design capacity. Equally important,&#13;
however, is the difficulty of marketing industrial machinery. At the risk&#13;
of oversimplification, the successful LDC exporters, especially in East Asia,&#13;
have concentrated on standardized consumer goods. In such industries as&#13;
textiles, clothing, and wigs, the product often is completely planned by the&#13;
ultimate importer in the developed countries. In the production of clothing,&#13;
for example, it is not unusual for the importer to specify the designs, choose&#13;
the materials, colors, and sizes, and completely finance the working capital&#13;
requirements of the producing company. In addition, the entire selling effort&#13;
in the importing nation is carried out by the buyer. Such countries as Korea&#13;
and Taiwan have locally owned trading companies that carry out similar func-&#13;
tions, but rarely have local producers had to assume the entire marketing&#13;
effort from design to sales in the developed countries.&#13;
In contrast, selling capital equipment to businesses is a much more&#13;
complex operation. Purchasers do not descend upon a country in hope of&#13;
finding a bargain. Indeed low prices seem to generate some doubts about the&#13;
quality of the equipment. Success in foreign markets depends much more on the&#13;
efforts of individual producers or their trading companies to identify trends&#13;
in products and markets. Extensive networks for overseas sales and servicing&#13;
need to be established, and even the mature LDC producers have had little such&#13;
experience. Furthermore the ability of equipment producers to extend credit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
and provide performance bonds is a critical feature in any export drive.&#13;
Until recently there has been only a limited effort in such areas not related&#13;
to production. In the light of these considerations, the engineering products&#13;
most likely to be exported in the next five or so years are those similar in&#13;
their marketing requirements to the standardized products already being sold,&#13;
such as textiles. It should be noted, however, that Argentina has recently&#13;
been successful in selling limited quantities of turnkey plants, primarily to&#13;
countries of the Latin American Free Trade Area. Whether these sales can be&#13;
replicated outside this protected environment remains to be seen, though they&#13;
are an encouraging sign of a new stage of development (Katz and Ablin 1978).&#13;
The character of marketing may explain, particularly for new pro-&#13;
ducts, why most LDC producers focus on the industrial-machinery market in the&#13;
developed countries. In particular, there are likely to be scale economies in&#13;
identifying markets, tailoring products to specific countries, and establishing&#13;
sales and servicing networks Once the major costs of these activities have&#13;
been incurred, considerable increases in sales should be possible without&#13;
commensurate increases in costs. This characteristic militates in favor of&#13;
concentrating on large markets, not the smaller markets typical of LDCs.&#13;
Marketing costs also impinge on some questions discussed earlier.&#13;
They may shift the efficiency balance toward large firms, even in product&#13;
groups in which scale economies in production are not to be found and are&#13;
likely to militate against adaptive behavior in design. If a LDC firm were&#13;
to design more labor-intensive equipment, the cost of successfully selling&#13;
it in other LDCs could reduce the net profitability of the design-production-&#13;
marketing operation below that on sales of unadapted machines to the developed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
countries. Although this result is not inevitable, it provides still another&#13;
reason for adaptive designs not to have yet become an important activity in&#13;
LDCs. It may also explain the reported reluctance of a number of Indian&#13;
machine-tool producers to undertake a sustained sales effort in any but the&#13;
large LDCs (Frankena 1971). M4any Korean manufacturers of industrial equipment&#13;
appear similarly diffident about entering the African market.&#13;
IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY&#13;
Production in the mechanical-engineering sector may provide an efficient&#13;
growth opportunity for some of the more advanced LDCs if a variety of cost-&#13;
increasing features do not offset the advantages accruing from lower costs&#13;
of skilled labor. But the sector's competitiveness in the long run requires,&#13;
in addition to improvements in static efficiency, greater effort and success&#13;
in adapting machinery designs to prevailing factor proportions.&#13;
Specific policy measures to increase static efficiency depend on&#13;
the source of the inefficiency. It is useful to emphasize the distinction&#13;
between cost-minimizing responses to existing relative factor prices and&#13;
those to such x-inefficient practices as unnecessary overcrowding in the&#13;
placement of machines. Only the latter are of policy interest, but only&#13;
insofar as increased competition, particularly from imports, is insufficient&#13;
to reduce x-inefficiency with socially optimal rapidity. In this case&#13;
x-inefficiency may warrant establishment of an industrial extension service,&#13;
efforts to provide technical materials in translation, and encouragement of&#13;
visits by local personnel to foreign factories or by the representatives of&#13;
those factories to the local industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
The financing of these activities depends on the organization of&#13;
the sector. If there is a large number of small and medium-sized firms, it is&#13;
likely that some learning will be diffused to firms that are not direct reci-&#13;
pients of technical aid. The externalities generated by this diffusion may&#13;
justify subsidization, if the conventional benefit-cost test can be met.&#13;
But if the organization of the sector is oligopolistic, as in several of the&#13;
countries currently active in capital-goods production, any externalities&#13;
will extend to only a small group of firms. It would then seem appropriate&#13;
for the costs of 'improving efficiency to be borne by these firms.&#13;
If it can be assumed that the evidence accurately conveys the&#13;
paucity of domestic research activity, it may be desirable for the public&#13;
sector to act as a catalyst for such activity. The character of the actions&#13;
required can be arrayed along a spectrum from implicit technology policies--&#13;
those working indirectly through changes in economic policies--to such explicit&#13;
policies as the subsidization of training of engineers or the establishment of&#13;
research institutes. Because the desirable mode of intervention is likely to&#13;
differ significantly by country, no universal recommendations are applicable.&#13;
In countries already possessing significant numbers of research per-&#13;
sonnel and laboratory facilities, implicit policies may be the only ones&#13;
required if the existing incentive structure, particularly the tariff regime,&#13;
leads to suboptimal levels of research. For example, a more competitive&#13;
environment in the machinery-purchasing sectors may stimulate a demand for&#13;
local adaptations of imported designs or for wholly new designs. Or the&#13;
remaval of import restrictions, whether these be quotas or high tariffs on&#13;
sectors supplying the machinery industry, would enable qualified personnel to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
engage in research rather than concentrate on bringing suppliers up to the&#13;
standards required. 1/&#13;
Other policies short of direct intervention may also affect deci-&#13;
sions about research and development. Of particular note are the tax treat-&#13;
ment of license fees and the limits on the magnitude and duration of such&#13;
payments. If the ready availability of licenses at relatively low prices&#13;
is perceived to reduce research and development below desirable levels,&#13;
policies could be designed to raise their net cost or make them more difficult&#13;
to obtain, though implementation may be difficult.&#13;
Explicit technology policies include those related to the acquisi-&#13;
tion of hardware, the subsidization of operating expenses, and the subsidiza-&#13;
tion of training for scientists, engineers, and technicians. In addition,&#13;
a variety of institutional mechanisms can be used to implement the actual&#13;
research, ranging from government-owned and industrywide institutes to&#13;
subsidies for research by private firms.&#13;
It seems likely that the newly industrialized countries, such as&#13;
South Korea and Taiwan, may require a greater emphasis on explicit policies&#13;
because of their relatively small endowments of research personnel and facili-&#13;
ties. Such countries as Argentina, Brazil, and India, on the other hand,&#13;
are more likely to derive relatively large benefits from changes in economic&#13;
policies. Just as for measures to increase x-efficiency, it Is desirable to&#13;
avoid public sector financing of activities that the private sector should&#13;
find profitable, unless there is strong evidence of significant capital-&#13;
market imperfections or excessive risk aversion. It also is important to&#13;
1/   Of course, such upgrading also is beneficial, and the benefits forgone&#13;
must be weighed against the gains from additional research.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
note that the subsidization of research is simply a variant of infant-industry&#13;
encouragement and should meet the same tests as those for commodity production.&#13;
Two other policies are desirable. First, barriers to the import&#13;
of high-quality machine tools should be removed. Although a relatively low&#13;
uniform tariff may be used to protect the entire machinery sector, prohibit-&#13;
ing the import of machine tools vital for achieving high-quality output is&#13;
counterproductive. Second, given the complexities of marketing producers'&#13;
goods, some aid may be justified if lumpy investments prevent individual&#13;
firms from establishing sufficiently large marketing efforts. Again, it is&#13;
necessary to avoid financing activities that the private sector should find&#13;
profitable.&#13;
Finally, some observations can be made about the choice of addi-&#13;
tional products. Most of the LDCs considered in this survey already produce&#13;
a fairly large range of capital goods. Any expansion of production would best&#13;
be concentrated in products exhibiting two characteristics: first, current&#13;
production techniques should not require competence in advanced sciences, such&#13;
as metallurgy, in particularly difficult production technologies; second, the&#13;
product should not be undergoing rapid design changes. An activity that&#13;
conforms to both guidelines is the production of standardized components&#13;
that producers in other countries can use: bearings, gears, and fasteners&#13;
are examples. Similarly, structural items, such as beds for machine tools&#13;
and frame bodies for engines, could be manufactured. All these product lines&#13;
require an achievable level of upgrading in foundries, forges, and stamping&#13;
operations but no major improvement in metallurgical or design skills. In&#13;
addition, expansion of these product lines provides an interim source of&#13;
export earnings as well as an incentive to achieve greater competence in&#13;
fundamental skills whose labor-intensive character must provide much of any&#13;
comparative advantage based on the low wage rates for skilled labor.&#13;

            Fostering the capital - goods sector in
            LDCs : a survey of evidence and requirements
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The conventional arguments in favor of
            the production of capital goods by LDCs are based on
            comparative advantage, the possibility of designs
            appropriate to indigenous factor proportions, and the
            externalities conferred on other sectors. Those arguments
            are inducing the governments of many middle-income countries
            to foster the development of the capital-goods sector. This
            raises questions about how, and at what pace, the production
            of capital goods should be fostered. It also raises some
            associated questions. This paper relies on a survey of the
            literature to shed light on, and enable some judgments
            about, each of these questions.
