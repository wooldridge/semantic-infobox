&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
     012 was declared the Year of                       air quality in Ulaanbaatar. Lower emission&#13;
     Sustainable Energy for All by the United           stoves are considered a short term pollution&#13;
     Nations and established universal                  abatement measure. Short term measures&#13;
access to modern energy services by 2030                can move forward more quickly than More&#13;
as a key target set for this initiative. By that        permanent solutions, such as improved&#13;
year, Mongolia already set out to achieve               housing, which take time to prepare and&#13;
access to cleaner, affordable cooking and               implement. Penetration of cleaner, low&#13;
heating appliances in peri-urban ger areas              emission models in Ulaanbaatar over the&#13;
of Ulaanbaatar. Despite initial success, a              past few years has indeed contributed&#13;
sustainable, clean stove market has not                 to better air quality. This success came&#13;
yet been established due to a number                    about with hard efforts from many&#13;
of challenges. The heating and cooking                  ministries, central government agencies,&#13;
conditions in Mongolia are relatively unique            the Ulaanbaatar municipality, Mongolian&#13;
in the world, combining a tradition to cook             universities, laboratories, donors and&#13;
and heat with the same appliance in a                   international financial institutions.&#13;
climate with extremely low temperatures,                    However, the achievements and&#13;
poor households living in thinly insulated              investments are at risk for a number&#13;
homes comprising mainly felt â&#128;&#156;gerâ&#128;&#157; tents                of factors discussed in this report. The&#13;
and small, cheaply constructed detached                 risks are sufficiently serious that they&#13;
houses, and no affordable or securely                   could even reverse hard-won air quality&#13;
supplied fuel alternatives to low quality               improvements. Stoves, fuels, usersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
coal. Because stoves are not efficient and              habits, dwelling characteristics are key&#13;
clean burning, they cause severe winter air             factors to determining fuel combustion&#13;
pollution making winter days some of the                and emissions. Prices, quality, reliable&#13;
most polluted in the world in Ulaanbaatar.              private sector supply chains, maintenance,&#13;
Some other Aimags have also reported                    standards and regulations are key building&#13;
winter air quality problems for the same                blocks for a commercial market. The right&#13;
reasons. Additionally, Mongolia achieved                combination of these factors, adjusted to&#13;
a very high penetration of cleaner, mainly              local conditions, can build a sustainable&#13;
imported, stoves in a very short period of              low emission stove market. The available&#13;
time in its largest market, Ulaanbaatar.                technologies and fuels, supply chain&#13;
This contrasts it with more gradual                     capacities, market demand segments, user&#13;
market development approaches in other                  preferences, incentives and regulations are&#13;
cookstove programs globally. With its                   key features of stove switching programs.&#13;
unique challenges and near term success                 Designing a program that considers all&#13;
story, Mongoliaâ&#128;&#153;s clean stove initiative also           these factors is not easy and requires&#13;
has the potential to significantly contribute           strong coordination across central and local&#13;
to the international body of knowledge in               government agencies, reliable private sector&#13;
development of cleaner cookstoves.                      participation, stable financing sources, and&#13;
    Reducing emissions from heating                     good program management. Monitoring&#13;
and cooking are part of the Mongolian                   and evaluation of stove switching programs&#13;
Government and Ulaanbaatar Municipalityâ&#128;&#153;s               is critical because technologies, suppliers,&#13;
multi-year, multi-sector strategy to improve            and market demand change over time.&#13;

                                 Clean Stove Initiative â&#128;&#147; Mongolia National Low Emission Stove Strategy   5&#13;
&amp;#12;        Building on six years of technical&#13;
    assistance, policy dialogue and recent&#13;
    stove switching program experience in&#13;
    Ulaanbaatar, this report sets out a proposed&#13;
    national low-emission stove strategy for&#13;
    Mongolia The objective of the strategy is&#13;
    to establish a sustainable market for low&#13;
    emission stoves in Mongolia. The report&#13;
    focuses on clean heating and cooking stoves&#13;
    as well as small water heating boilers used&#13;
    in peri-urban ger areas of Ulaanbaatar and&#13;
    other Aimags and Soum centers.&#13;
        The strategy is valid for the current&#13;
    clean stove market development situation&#13;
    and may change in the near future.&#13;
    Therefore, results should be monitored and&#13;
    fine-tuned when needed.&#13;
        This    report,    it's   asusumptions,&#13;
    suggestions and recommendations are&#13;
    valid for the clean stove market as of the&#13;
    time of writing this repor. Conditions are&#13;
    dynamic and can influence the design&#13;
    of the strategy. Recently, the Australian&#13;
    Government provided funds through&#13;
    the World Bank to sustain this dialogue&#13;
    through the Mongolia Clean Stove Initiative&#13;
    technical assistance project, which financed&#13;
    the development of this report.&#13;

    Recent air quality improvements in UB                      units, such as small water heating&#13;

   changes in the subsidy mechanism                      to stop subsidies abruptly without a&#13;
   can be substantial because it would                   comprehensive policy that supports&#13;
   introduce competition, force a change                 a transition to low-emission stoves,&#13;

US$ 2000 per household. The benefits                      clean stove market in Ulaanbaatar. If&#13;
of USD 52-96 million per year (mean of                    successful, cleaner, low emissions stoves&#13;

per year per household in Ulaanbaatar. The&#13;
actual one-time subsidy paid so far ranged&#13;
from US$ 250-350 per stove: this level of&#13;
costs is far below the annual economic&#13;
benefit obtained from using these stoves.&#13;
Annex 2 of this strategy provides additional&#13;
economic analysis.&#13;
    While stoves are only part of the&#13;
answer to solving Ulaanbaatarâ&#128;&#153;s air quality&#13;
problems, the analysis in this strategy lead&#13;
to a conclusion that a higher share of the&#13;
urban population needs to have access&#13;
to cleaner stoves in order to sustain and&#13;
increase their contributions to air quality&#13;
improvements especially in Ulaanbaatar.&#13;
The strategy calls for not only expanding&#13;
to other urban markets but also for&#13;
introducing and enforcing standards&#13;
for small water heating boilers, which&#13;
have received little attention thus far. It&#13;
recognizes there are links between stove&#13;
markets in Ulaanbaatar and other aimag&#13;
centers. This can be a threat, but it can&#13;
also be an opportunity as described above.&#13;

     Box 1: Terminology&#13;
       In this report, the term â&#128;&#156;clean stovesâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;low emission stovesâ&#128;&#157; are used interchangeably, so are&#13;
     â&#128;&#156;dirty stovesâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;traditional stovesâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
       Traditional stoves: rectangular steel stoves, originally designed for burning wood. With Nalaikh coal,&#13;
     the SEET lab showed that traditional stove emit about 600-700 mg/net MJ of PM2.5; with Baganuur&#13;
     coal this is 1400-1500 mg/net MJ.&#13;
       Low emission stoves: They emit less than 70 mg/net MJ of PM2.5, or a 90% reduction compared to&#13;
     traditional stoves operating on Nalaikh coal.&#13;
       Heating wall: a hollow, heat retaining wall that is connected to the stove, consisting of a combination&#13;
     of horizontal and vertical flue channels.&#13;
       Small water heating boilers: also called low pressure boilers. These are stoves with a heat exchanger&#13;
     and are used in somewhat larger houses; the working fluid is water that circulates through pipes and&#13;
     radiators to heat the house. More expensive systems use pumps to circulate the water, while others&#13;
     use the thermo syphon effect.&#13;

    This strategy has three sections following&#13;
this introduction. Chapter 2 is an analysis&#13;
of strengths and challenges of the stove&#13;
switching programs. Chapter 3 presents&#13;
the strategic objectives and plan. Chapter&#13;
4 presents a road map for implementing&#13;
the strategy.&#13;
    The strategy relies on several missions&#13;
observing Ulaanbaatar stove market as&#13;
well as one mission conducting a rapid&#13;
assessment of the stove market outside&#13;
Ulaanbaatar. In particular, the strategy&#13;
relies on the findings of a 1000 household&#13;
survey (referred to in the report as the CSI&#13;
survey) in the ger areas of Ulaanbaatar&#13;
as well as the rapid assessment in areas&#13;
outside Ulaanbaatar. The findings are&#13;
published in Mongolia: Heating Stove&#13;
Market Trends in Poor, Peri-Urban Ger&#13;
Areas of Ulaanbaatar and Selected Markets&#13;
Outside Ulaanbaatar (December 2013)&#13;
and translated into Mongolian. The 1000&#13;
household survey made use of a similar&#13;
1000 household survey conducted by the&#13;
Bank in 2009 (before any major stove&#13;
switching program). These two surveys&#13;
help to detect and describe impacts of the&#13;
stove switching program on the market and&#13;
user characteristics. The Surveyâ&#128;&#153;s findings&#13;
are reflected in this analysis.&#13;

                                                          driven by rising incomes.&#13;
&#13;
   Box 2 Low-emission stove market segments&#13;
      In order to successfully meet market demands, market segments need to be clearly defined. Markets&#13;
   for heating appliances, both in and outside Ulaanbaatar, consist of three distinct market segments:&#13;
   (i) stand-alone stoves used in gers (felt tents) and detached homes (made from wood and/or brick,&#13;
   occasionally with two levels, often poorly insulated); (ii) stoves attached to heating walls in medium-&#13;
   size detached homes; and (iii) SWHBs in larger detached homes with radiators and/or piped hot water&#13;
   systems in most rooms, which is the high-end of coal-fired heating appliances. Households in general&#13;
   use their heating stoves for most of their cooking, especially during the winter months, although some&#13;
   households with SWHBs also have another cooking appliance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     From 2007-2012, the number of                        are the largest (73 m2).&#13;
households in the six central ger area                         With more wealth, households move&#13;
districts has grown by 36 percent or                      into larger dwellings and upgrade their&#13;
43,990 households. In the same period,                    heating systems. This is important because&#13;
the average size of dwellings has increased               fuel use correlates with dwelling size: ger&#13;
in all market segments, correlating with                  homes reported using 3.9 tons of coal per&#13;
increases in income. According to the CSI                 year, compared to 4.84 tons for homes&#13;
household survey, about 44 percent of                     with heating walls and 6.3 tons for homes&#13;
households have a ger in their hashaa (a                  using SWHBs. Heating walls continue to be&#13;
small fenced-in plot), about 42 percent                   the most common form of heating system,&#13;
have a detached home of one or two levels,                although the proportion of detached&#13;
and about 14 percent have both a ger and                  homes with heating walls dropped from 70&#13;
a detached home. The average floor area                   percent in 2007 to 62 percent in 2012. This&#13;
of a five-walled ger is 28m2. The averaged                market share was almost entirely taken by&#13;
detached house without a heating wall that                SWHBs, which increased from 16 percent&#13;
relies on a space-heating ger stove has a                 to 23 percent. Homes with stand-alone&#13;
living area of 39 m2. The average home                    stoves without heating walls, a step above&#13;
with a heating wall is slightly larger, with              living in gers, maintained a stable share&#13;
an area of 41 m2, and homes with SWHBs                    at 15 percent of total detached-home&#13;
                                                          households.&#13;

&amp;#12;    The CSI survey furthermore shows that                 and CAF. However, it has encountered&#13;
around 67% of traditional stove users are                 production issues. Low capacity of local&#13;
interested in switching to a low-emission                 production is a function of a lack of interest&#13;

has risen significantly to 9 years, from                  low-emission stoves and SWHBs.&#13;
6 years in 2007. Because stoves have an                       Current low-e stoves are very high&#13;

the remaining households with traditional                 might have less appealing finishes or other&#13;
stoves will likely buy replacement stoves                 features. A transition to a sustainable&#13;

large, un-served segments of the ger-area                 adjustment in consumer expectations in&#13;
market that use relatively more coal.                     what they get for their money. However,&#13;
    In summary, when incomes rise,                        the private sector is innovative and may&#13;
households want larger homes and                          deliver very high quality at lower prices,&#13;
more comfortable heating solutions, i.e.,                 if given a chance to do so. Changing the&#13;
more heat, less refueling, lower fuel                     subsidy model may therefore trigger strong&#13;
consumption. Efforts to promote cleaner                   resistance from both users and suppliers of&#13;
air in Mongolia should take this into                     low-e stoves. The appearance of a local&#13;
account by providing low-emission heating                 assembly plant appears to proof this point.&#13;

This is understandable as new technologies                 and stove replacement initiatives. The ger&#13;

education and awareness campaign should                    and habits can inform the development,&#13;

to awareness campaigns, as illustrated                     and more properly usedâ&#128;&#148;when they align&#13;
by the fact that when there were a few                     more closely with the traditional patterns&#13;

awareness campaign was very effective                          Apart from producing less pollution,&#13;
in passing the right messages and even                     low-emission stoves are also seen by&#13;
households outside Ulaanbaatar - without                   their users as saving fuel, one of the&#13;

     While there is an emerging consensus                 stove. As an example, after the Government&#13;
among policy makers to base decisions on                  recently closed the Nalaikh mines, most&#13;
scientifically determined laboratory testing              households started using Baganuur coal.&#13;
of stove-fuel emissions performance,                      Unfortunately, Baganuur coal burns&#13;
some policies remain unsubstantiated                      less cleanly than Nalaikh coal: the SEET&#13;
or contradict each other. Emission                        laboratory showed that the traditional stove&#13;
performance of different fuel-stove                       roughly doubles PM2.5 emissions. Depending&#13;
combinations varies and reliable laboratory               on the number of traditional stoves in use,&#13;
emissions performance tests are essential                 this may have negative consequences on&#13;
to determine their potential contributions                air quality in Ulaanbaatar. Currently tested,&#13;
to air pollution reduction objectives. The                low emission stoves will also be affected,&#13;
impact that low-emission stoves have on                   though less so than traditional stoves.&#13;
air pollution essentially depends on three                Some low-e stoves remain very clean and&#13;
elements: (i) the stove; (ii) the fuel; and               can still reduce emissions by over 90%&#13;
(iii) the user. The combination of the three              compared to a traditional stove using&#13;
determines how cleanly the stove performs.                Nalaikh coal.The â&#128;&#156;+90% criteriaâ&#128;&#157; is one of&#13;
A fourth element exists that however is                   the eligibility criteria for support under the&#13;
not considered in this strategy: insulation               current stove switching program. However,&#13;
and heat retention characteristics of the                 after switching the dominant coal type,&#13;
dwelling. Emissions performance test results              one of the low-emission stove models that&#13;
may differ from reality, when stoves are                  had been widely sold, could not any longer&#13;
used by households due to a lack of user                  meet the +90% criteria. As a result, it is&#13;
education and ingrained habits. Emission                  not supported in the current phase of the&#13;
&#13;
30   Clean Stove Initiative â&#128;&#147; Mongolia National Low Emission Stove Strategy&#13;
&amp;#12;stove switching program.&#13;
    If policies to introduce alternative fuels&#13;
such as semi-coke coal are pursued, it is&#13;
imperative that the alternative fuels are&#13;
tested for emissions when burned in a&#13;
stove and that the results are made public.&#13;
This information helps evaluate estimated&#13;
impacts on emissions against program&#13;
costs. Mandating new fuels may also&#13;
require introducing new types of stoves that&#13;
are designed specifically for those fuels. If&#13;
the right stove is not paired with the right&#13;
fuel, emission reductions will differ. So far,&#13;
the government has provided significant&#13;
support to alternative fuel producers&#13;
(especially for semi-coke coal). Yet, the&#13;
CSI survey reveals that only 5 percent of&#13;
all households reported using semi-coke&#13;
coal on a regular basis. These include only&#13;
49 percent of households in the Bayangol&#13;
District where raw coal is formally banned.&#13;
Comparatively, 98 percent of households&#13;
in the six districts report using raw coal,&#13;
while 6 percent burn dried animal dung.&#13;
    In summary, support for different&#13;
possible air pollution solutions should be&#13;
based on PM emission performance of&#13;
fuel and stove combinations, in addition&#13;
to quality and fuel consumption criteria.&#13;
However, air pollution performance is more&#13;
stringent and takes precedence over other&#13;
criteria, which are normally satisfied for&#13;
well designed and built stoves. Households&#13;
should continue to be reminded that their&#13;
stoves need to be operated appropriately&#13;
to minimize emissions and maximize fuel&#13;
efficiency.&#13;

 c)	The current subsidized price of low-&#13;
     emission stoves is lower than traditional&#13;

     government would need to continue&#13;
     its program to sustain benefits for the&#13;
     indefinite future; (ii) it would also need&#13;
     to continue a rigorous quality control&#13;
     and verification system, which may&#13;
     be cost prohibitive when expanded&#13;
     nationally; and (iii) some households&#13;
     could have an incentive to sell their low-&#13;
     emission stove on the black market.&#13;
    Nevertheless, a consumer subsidy&#13;
appears to be necessary in the short-term&#13;
to gradually adjust distorted consumer&#13;
expectations so as to promote further&#13;
stove switching. Eliminating it in the short&#13;

&amp;#12;   Box 3 Reassessing Principles of the Current Subsidy Scheme&#13;
      The current subsidy comprises 3 elements in principle; the value is justified based on future economic&#13;
   health benefits, which are considerable. In addition to air pollution benefits, these elements could&#13;
   be brought out more in public relations campaigns to raise public awareness of the rationale for the&#13;
   subsidy:&#13;
   (i)	 Replacement component; households hand in their old stove which represents a value to them;&#13;
   (ii)	Equalization component; to render the price of the low-e-stove similar to the traditional stove;&#13;
         households are able to purchase a traditional stove, so they should be able to buy a low-emission&#13;
         stove at that price level too;&#13;
   (iii)	Promotional component; to convince households to buy a low-emission stove now rather than in&#13;
         the future.&#13;
&#13;
    One option to consider is that the                     Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s current message that high&#13;
subsidy would be a fixed amount that is                    subsidies are not to last past this winter&#13;

should avoid end user prices that are lower                     If this option is chosen, the subsidy&#13;
than current traditional stove models, taking              should be made available only for a&#13;
into account transport costs. The level of                 limited period of time, for instance&#13;
the subsidy should be set carefully as not                 about three years. Thereafter the subsidy&#13;
to introduce further market distortions,                   should be dramatically reduced or entirely&#13;
but should consider transportation costs to                discontinued.&#13;

that they have 3 years to replace their                   remaining households to switch to low&#13;
equipment before the standards will be                    emission stoves and SWHBs.&#13;
mandatory and dirty equipment cannot be&#13;
used anymore.&#13;
    Although there is a clear preference&#13;
among many government officials to&#13;
promote local production, the regulatory&#13;
framework should treat all producers and&#13;
models, whether imported or domestic,&#13;
even handedly. This will foster competition,&#13;
innovation and keep open doors to new&#13;
technologies and materials unavailable in&#13;
Mongolia. Currently, all low-emission stoves&#13;
are imported (except for one model) and&#13;
all dirty stoves are manufactured locally14.&#13;
    Stricter regulation will be easier to&#13;
apply for SWHB than for stoves. The prices&#13;
of SWHB are already fairly high and any&#13;
incremental costs due to regulation are&#13;
likely to be relatively low. Since many&#13;
SWHB are imported, it would be fairly&#13;
simple to immediately stop imports of&#13;
dirty SWHBs. It will be more difficult to&#13;
stop the local manufacturing of dirty&#13;
SWHB models, although it would fit well&#13;
in an effort to professionalize the heating&#13;
equipment market. A licensing procedure&#13;
is recommended to professionalize&#13;
local producers of SWHB and start&#13;
manufacturing only low-emission SWHB&#13;

&amp;#12;     Box 4 Local Mongolian Manufacturing Capacity&#13;
       There are several different types of stove suppliers in Mongolia: (i) backyard/garage type of&#13;
     operators with a minimum of equipment and able to manufacture a few stoves per day; (ii) semi-&#13;
     industrial operators with a small metal workshop that is used for the production of stoves and other&#13;
     products, and able to manufacture a few 10s of stoves per day; and (iii) industrial operators. The&#13;
     industrial operators have modern production facilities and can easily produce different stove models at&#13;
     a capacity of 100 per day; their core business is to produce other products.&#13;
       The one Mongolian stove model that is eligible for support under UBCAP is produced in such an&#13;
     industrial production facility. The backyard/garage operators are not likely to be able to provide the&#13;
     quality and quantity required for large-scale dissemination of low-emission stoves. In general traditional&#13;
     stoves do not necessarily have quality issues even though they are produced in several backyard/&#13;
     garage facilities throughout town: the earlier 1000 household survey found that the typical life time&#13;
     of traditional stoves is 10 years. However, the production capacity is limited. Given the small number&#13;
     of new models over the years, innovative, small scale production is not possible from the existing&#13;
     backyard/garage producers. The suppliers will also not be able to quickly satisfy demand at scale.&#13;
       It may be worthwhile to explore if a production facility could be opened to a consortium of smaller&#13;
     producers that have developed eligible models. This idea has floated among stove producers and MUB&#13;
     for some time but was never realized. With the assistance of SDC, however this is an idea to pursue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    During the transition period, a Stove                    low temperatures with poorly insulated&#13;
Development Center can assist local                          homes such as ger and small cheaply&#13;
producers with the design of cleaner models.                 constructed detached houses. This causes&#13;
The SDC can assist local stove producers                     more heating energy to be used than&#13;
in: (i) developing cleaner stove models by                   necessary, and better insulation materials&#13;
modifying the combustion characteristics                     may help to improve this. In fact, the&#13;

to establishing a SDC with the support of                    specific solutions for summer and/or&#13;
MUB/UBCAP (for equipment only) and its                       winter cooking. Longer-term solutions for&#13;
own resources (for facilities operation and                  innovation consist of the next generation of&#13;
maintenance and staffing). This should be                    clean fuel technologies, such as coal to gas&#13;

- and be a place where producers who fail                    as the technology improves and provide&#13;

can be the frontline of innovation.&#13;
Key Parliamentarians will also need to&#13;
support the strategy. The private sector&#13;
and households are ultimately critical to&#13;
success. A lead ministry should be selected&#13;

&amp;#12;For heating stoves, standards exist but these               but in addition there are safety issues that&#13;
are not stringent enough and the current                    need to be regulated as well. There no&#13;
low-emission stoves outperform them. As                     emission standards for SWHB, although&#13;
an example, the current emission standard                   there are likely similar standards in other&#13;
for heating stoves is based on European                     countries, e,g, in China for SWHB.&#13;
standards, but the currently supported                          It is proposed that the PMU initiates&#13;
eligible stoves are far cleaner because the                 and coordinates the following actions with&#13;
eligibility criteria for consumer subsidies                 relevant authorities to develop and enforce&#13;

   The standards need to be developed in a                  as possible. Producers may need time to&#13;
concerted effort between the NCAPR, the                     develop new models. As noted in Chapter 3,&#13;
MUST SEET laboratory, and the standards                     local stove producers are supported by: (a)&#13;
organization, the Mongolian Agency                          being eligible to submit models that would&#13;

agree how clean is realistically possible for               regulations and fiscal/tax incentives for&#13;

&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;    As noted in Chapter 3, local stove                will be set up at strategic locations, in&#13;
producers have not been able to develop               Ulaanbaatar as well as in other Aimag or&#13;
stoves that meet the UBCAP eligibility                Soum centers in accordance to the priorities&#13;
criteria, which are stricter than the current         as indicated by the NCAPR.&#13;
standard. The exception is one Mongolian                  With the assistance of local leaders, the&#13;
company that was able to be included in               PMU will identify the most suitable business&#13;
the current selection of eligible stoves.             or organization to host a PC in the selected&#13;
Out of the 15 stove models submitted for              location and sign an agreement. The PC&#13;
eligibility testing, only 4 qualified. Out of         should be attached to an existing, viable&#13;
the 8 submitted Mongolian stove models,               business or organization that may have&#13;
only one met the eligibility criteria. In the         an interest in operating the PC to increase&#13;
past Mongolian stove suppliers experienced            his own business, e.g., hardware stores.&#13;
a common production problem: the                      The latter could, if interested, create even&#13;
production capacity is not high enough to             more PC in different locations nationwide.&#13;
quickly satisfy the demand, and there are             At a PC all eligible stove models are on&#13;
issues with quality control of their stoves           display and can be purchased. Users can&#13;
due to the nature of the non-automated                place purchase orders at the PC, which will&#13;
production process.                                   record orders in the electronic database&#13;
    MUST has encountered delays in setting            and process paperwork as in the current&#13;
up the Stove Development Center, but it               program. Households will deposit their&#13;
should now be established shortly. Once               contribution at a participating commercial&#13;
operational, it can provide assistance to             bank branch at their location. The PMU&#13;
stove suppliers in modifying and improving            will need to approach commercial banks,&#13;
their models into low-emission stoves, as             such as XacBank, to participate and willing&#13;
well as advice on the production process. It          to offer microcredits. The PC will combine&#13;
is recommended to quickly include current             and group orders and communicate these&#13;
traditional stove producers in this process           with the suppliers for the delivery of the&#13;
as they would be out of a job once the                stoves. The participating commercial bank&#13;
enforcement starts.                                   will also arrange for payment of the&#13;
                                                      buyersâ&#128;&#153; deposit into the supplierâ&#128;&#153;s bank&#13;
Step 5: Set up supply chain of low-&#13;
                                                      account and request release of the subsidy&#13;
emission stoves outside Ulaanbaatar&#13;
                                                      from the PMU once the stoves have been&#13;
    Towards the end of the first year, such           installed.&#13;
distribution chain could be set up. Once&#13;
the suppliers have diversified the supply&#13;
of low-emission stoves in Ulaanbaatar,&#13;
these stoves should also become available&#13;
outside the capital. The state of the market&#13;
is not advanced enough to expect stove&#13;
suppliers to set up their own supply chain.&#13;
Until now, users knew that they could only&#13;
get a trusted low-emission stove for a&#13;
fixed price at a PC. The concept of Product&#13;
Centers should therefore be used until users&#13;
understand the quality difference between&#13;
low-emission and traditional stoves. PCs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Clean Stove Initiative â&#128;&#147; Mongolia National Low Emission Stove Strategy   55&#13;
&amp;#12;    The PC will thus place bulk orders                       modified. PCs are exclusive, trusted sales&#13;
with the suppliers of eligible stoves, while                 centers that prevent illegal copycat models&#13;
coordinating closely with the PMU. The PC                    from being sold. Retaining this system as&#13;
owner is paid for services rendered including                it is would incur continued costs to the&#13;
transferring client deposits to suppliers via                government, but would preserve a key part&#13;
the local bank branch, installing the stove                  of the quality control system. See Box 5 for&#13;
and training the user, removing the old                      more details about the sales and distribution&#13;
stove, liaising with the QAA (see below).                    mechanism applied in Ulaanbaatar.&#13;
The supplier will transport the stoves to&#13;
the PC and will truck out the old stoves.&#13;
All costs for these operations15 will be built&#13;
into the price of the stove. Initially a few&#13;
PCs will be set up in Ulaanbaatar, and as&#13;
quickly as some experience is obtained with&#13;
these new style PCs, the 10 cities where&#13;
air pollution problems have been reported&#13;
will also be equipped. More PCs can be&#13;
identified and set up if there is particularly&#13;
strong demand for low-emission stoves in&#13;
a particular region or location.&#13;
    In the long-run, if and when suppliers&#13;
become more professional, the Government&#13;
may wish to set up a licensing system to&#13;
replace the PC distribution system and&#13;
the quality control mechanism along the&#13;
lines as proposed for SWHBs. This would&#13;
guarantee quality at entry, i.e., stoves&#13;
sold by a licensed supplier are necessarily&#13;
low-emission stoves Stove suppliers can&#13;
obtain and maintain their license as long&#13;
as they only sell clean stoves, and provide&#13;
good services to their clients. They should&#13;
submit new models for testing the by&#13;
SEET laboratory before putting them on&#13;
the market. There should be checks and&#13;
balances to verify compliance, for which&#13;
the SSIA and MUB are responsible.&#13;
    It is proposed to gradually extend the&#13;
sales and distribution system to make low-&#13;
emission stoves available in other Aimags.&#13;
The sales and distribution system using&#13;
Product Centers should be preserved but&#13;
&#13;
15	&#13;
      Average transport costs for 800 km nationwide; transport to and installation at the client; training of the&#13;
      client; taking away the old stove; service fee for operations of the PC; cost of QAA.&#13;

&amp;#12;    Box 5 The Sales and Distribution System in UB&#13;
       Producers and stove models are selected competitively, against specific criteria. Once selected,&#13;
    Producers sign a Producers Agreement with the Project Management Unit. The Producers Agreement&#13;
    sets the rules and responsibilities of suppliers, including minimum service standards, installation&#13;
    responsibilities and penalties for non-compliance. Producers have the right to sell their eligible models&#13;
    through Product Centers. Ineligible models and producers are excluded from the Product Centers.&#13;
       Product Centers are managed by a Distribution and Sales Agent (DSA). The DSA is XacBank who&#13;
    places representative in each PC to process paperwork, offer microloans for down payments, and&#13;
    record sales. In addition, NGO staff are available at each PC to provide consumers with product&#13;
    information. Customers make payments at XacBank branches, which transfer funds to producers.&#13;
    XacBank also collects emission reduction rights from customers and sells these rights to carbon&#13;
    markets. This covers only part of the costs of the PCs and the government, through the Clean Air&#13;
    Fund, pays an additional fee for its services. XacBank representatives at the PC also make an electronic&#13;
    record of installation (and removal of old stoves) by SMS when stoves are installed, recording the&#13;
    location. It maintains a database (accessible to the PMU) of sales, installations by model number and&#13;
    location that is frequently updated. Paperwork is forwarded to the Project Management Unit which is&#13;
    used as evidence, together with the electronic verification, for paying the consumerâ&#128;&#153;s subsidy to the&#13;
    eligible stove supplier. The roles and responsibilities of the DSA are defined in a DSA Agreement signed&#13;
    between the DSA and the PMU. Verification of installation will be impossible for stoves sold during&#13;
    Phase 1 of the expansion program.&#13;
       Customers sign a User Agreement which defines the roles and responsibilities of households, including&#13;
    following the user manual, allowing the QAA to visit, and promising to use the stove and not resell it.&#13;
       Upon verified down payments by households, lists are sent to suppliers by the DSA and delivery&#13;
    schedules are arranged. As a part of their agreement, suppliers visit each household, install the new&#13;
    stove, train customers in lighting, refueling and use, and remove old stoves. Old stoves are deposited&#13;
    at collection sites managed by a company that transports them to a scrap metal and recycling facility&#13;
    in Darkhan. The installation and removal costs are included in the price of the stove. Stove disposal is&#13;
    commercially based with no additional charges to consumers or the government.&#13;
       A Quality Assurance Agent (QAA) is hired by the PMU to independently verify installation. It visits&#13;
    households at the point of installation, verifies their training and sends a separate report to the&#13;
    PMU. It also visits households a few months after installation to check on proper use and household&#13;
    satisfaction. It also makes spot checks by sending random units to the SEET laboratory for testing.&#13;
    Monitoring reports are provided to the PMU.&#13;
       A Project Management Unit is proposed to be established for the national program to supervise the&#13;
    program. The Ulaanbaatar city maintains a Steering Committee to govern the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  A phased approach is proposed to expand                  in UBâ&#128;&#153;s ger areas to continue to sell stoves&#13;
coverage by reducing the cost via making                   to ger area households, while one PC,&#13;
use of the PC based distribution system in                 possibly at the Narantuul market where&#13;
the short run. In the long run however,                    shoppers come from outside Ulaanbaatar,&#13;
as the market matures, licensed suppliers                  could be open to start the sales of stoves&#13;
should take over the sale of eligible stoves               nationally. The latter would not only serve&#13;
from PCs and operate their own distribution                the demand in Ulaanbaatar, but also the&#13;
chains. The national expansion is proposed                 rest of the country until PCs are set up&#13;
in three phases.                                           in the country side (Phase 2), but does&#13;

       Under the Rural and Renewable Energy Access Project (REAP) subsidized solar home systems (SHS)&#13;
     were sold and distributed to rural households. Service centers were set up in selected aimag and soum&#13;
     centers. The SHS were transported by suppliers to the service centers, and local technicians were used&#13;
     for the installation of the systems. The service centers were paid for the services rendered.&#13;

    The NCAPR should hire a professional PR                   It is proposed that during the initial&#13;

campaign should be considered an integral                 stove. During these three years, the subsidy&#13;
part of the program and not merely as an                  mechanism will continue to be available&#13;
added-on requirement: it is a necessary                   for users but the amounts provided are far&#13;
activity for the success of the program.                  less than before. After the 3 year period,&#13;
People need to be informed consistently                   the subsidy will no longer be provided but&#13;
over a longer period because it involves                  instead a ban on the use of traditional&#13;
changing customary habits and practices.                  stoves will be enforced. It is suggested&#13;
The campaign should be rolled out early                   that the period leading to the ban and the&#13;
on in the first year so that households and               period that the subsidy is available is the&#13;
suppliers know the approach for stove                     same, but this is not necessary: it is up to&#13;
dissemination.                                            the NCAPR to decide.&#13;
    Raising awareness of the general public                   The suggested subsidy mechanism is&#13;
(users) and suppliers of stoves is essential              similar to before, but simpler and with&#13;
to explain and gain support for regulatory                lower subsidy levels. The user visits a PC to&#13;
changes and policies that may affect their                sign a purchase order and deposits his initial&#13;
habits, product choices, pocketbooks and                  payment. He will get the subsidy assigned&#13;
in some cases jobs. Consultations should                  once the stove is installed. The subsidy&#13;
be a part of reaching out especially to                   is a fixed percentage of the retail price.&#13;
affected stakeholders like traditional                    The PC staff assumes the responsibility to&#13;
stove producers, to understand their                      communicate with the PMU in Ulaanbaatar&#13;
concerns and build up plans together on                   to request releasing the subsidy. The PC&#13;
transitions away for producing unqualified                staff also communicates with the suppliers&#13;
and polluting models (e.g. serving clean                  and the involved bank, and makes the&#13;
models). Success can be achieved only                     necessary financial transfers. The PMU&#13;
through such an approach.                                 release the subsidy once the PC provided&#13;

(i) In Ulaanbaatar in one hashaa, more                    the city but without the possibility to buy&#13;

heating stoves in herder households.                      35,000 households with a SWHB system&#13;

                                                          the number of secondary stoves; the&#13;
    In Ulaanbaatar there are four categories              Stocktaking report found that 9% of the&#13;
of additional stoves: (i) in households with              households reported 2 or more stoves,&#13;
more than one stove per household; (ii) in                which would be an additional 16000&#13;
summer homes; (iii) in households of new                  traditional stoves. Moreover, a number&#13;

their clean stove.                                        most likely has a stove as well. Based on&#13;
    Experience suggests that quite a few                  discussions with PMU, MUB and MUST&#13;
Ulaanbaatar households operate more                       staff, as a first order estimation it has&#13;
than one stove in their household, or                     been assumed that 10% of the population&#13;

households may live on a hashaa with more                 in the surroundings of Ulaanbaatar. Due&#13;
than one (heated) building, and quite a                   to the rapid expansion of the city, many&#13;
few households have a summer place that                   of these summerhouses are now located&#13;
may also occasionally be used in the winter               in the outskirts of town and could actually&#13;
time. Although the majority of households                 contribute to air pollution. One thing is&#13;
in Ulaanbaatar will soon have changed                     beyond doubt: how many summer homes&#13;

Why should the subsidy mechanism                                 prices. The applied end-user prices for&#13;
change?                                                          different models, even with different&#13;

I&#13;
  n order to sustain and increase the air                        sizes, shapes, finishes, etc., are&#13;
  quality benefits in UB and in polluted                         practically the same22.&#13;
  Aimags, (i) a reliable supply of low-e                    (iii)	 The lack of incentives to supply&#13;
stoves is needed; and (ii) households need                       lower cost models poses a significant&#13;
to be motivated to switch from using their                       risk to UB air quality. If the high&#13;
traditional stoves to a new clean stove                          level of subsidy is abruptly stopped&#13;
even before the end of the life-cycle of                         and not replaced with a modified&#13;
the traditional stove. The Government                            subsidy mechanism, and there are no&#13;
of Mongolia decided to complement the                            alternative models, traditional stoves&#13;
MCAâ&#128;&#153;s consumer subsidy so as to further                          will regain market share. In the absence&#13;
accelerate stove switching in Ulaanbaatar.                       of a modified approach, this is the&#13;
This brought about unrelistic market                             current most likely scenario that will be&#13;
expectations for a secondary market                              realized.&#13;
for re-selling stoves to residents outside                  (iv)	 Suppliers confirmed that it is&#13;
Ulaanbaatar. In addition, the subsidy                            feasible to supply different models&#13;
mechanism used in the past now forces                            of low-e stoves with good emission&#13;
the UB municipality to negotiate retail                          performance but at lower list prices.&#13;
prices and subsidy levels for each stove                         Some current models might not be&#13;
model with stove suppliers. While targeted                       suitable to produce locally, but the&#13;
subsidies can be a useful tool to promote                        private sector should be able to find&#13;
large-scale switching, the current subsidy                       ways to modify models to meet&#13;
mechanism should not be used for the                             regulations and market needs.&#13;
following reasons:                                          (v)	A larger variety of low-e stoves would&#13;
 (i)	The information on unit costs is                            be beneficial to more quickly promote&#13;
     asymmetrical â&#128;&#147; the suppliers always                         switching of stoves.&#13;
     have more information than the                         	 In principle, the current subsidy&#13;
     government on the production and                            comprises 3 separate elements that&#13;
     distribution costs of their products. As                    each motivates the end-user in its&#13;
     a possible consequence, the current                         own rights; the value of the subsidy&#13;
     subsidy mechanism may have driven                           is justified based on future economic&#13;
     list prices of currently eligible stoves                    health benefits that are considerable:&#13;
     higher than they would be if sold on&#13;

municipality and the Government of&#13;
Mongolia of negotiating directly with                     The justification for the subsidy is&#13;
stove suppliers and offer a fixed subsidy             based on health, fuel savings and comfort&#13;
amount irrespective of list prices. In this           benefits for households buying the stove,&#13;
way, the government protects its public               as well as on the benefits of improving the&#13;
interest by: (i) ensuring any stove model             air quality in the aimag or soum center and&#13;
purchased from now on complies with                   also for maintaining the air quality benefits&#13;
its emissions reduction targets and other             in UB.&#13;
regulations; (ii) stays out of commercial&#13;
considerations and leaves this entirely to&#13;
the private sector; (iii) yet provides an&#13;
incentive to stimulate demand for clean&#13;
stoves. Stove suppliers would submit&#13;
stoves for performance testing, the SEET&#13;
lab would report test results to producers&#13;
and the UB city/NCARP, and the UB city/&#13;
NCARP would evaluate the tests and other&#13;
documentation to determine if the models&#13;
and suppliers meet their eligibility criteria.&#13;
     The table below presents different&#13;
scenarios for the reformed subsidy&#13;
mechanism using the same fixed amount&#13;
of subsidy for all clean stoves. The NCARP&#13;
and UB municipality would need to use its&#13;
own judgment, informed by discussions&#13;
with suppliers and its own research, as&#13;
to the retail prices needed to stimulate&#13;
demand. It is recommended to phase out&#13;
the subsidy over a transitional period of&#13;
2-3 years.&#13;
     The table below shows approximate list&#13;
prices of different low-e stoves and the&#13;
effect of the new subsidy: both stoves that&#13;
have been supported under earlier phases&#13;

     The first line in Table 1 illustrates applied             Subsidy Mechanism Options&#13;
subsidy levels during the earlier phases                       All stove suppliers with stoves that&#13;
of the stove switching program, with a                     satisfy the eligibility criteria can be&#13;
subsidy level of around 90% and stoves                     supported. Three different options are&#13;
with list prices between 250 and 300 US$.                  distinguished.&#13;
End-users paid far less than the cost of                       Option a: fixed percentage subsidy&#13;
a traditional stove. For the next heating&#13;
season, it is proposed to apply a fixed                        Households receive a fixed subsidy&#13;
subsidy level for all stoves. The second                   percentage for a low-e stove purchase&#13;
line uses US$ 30 per stove and the third                   although this is paid directly to the supplier&#13;
line US$ 50 per stove. Depending on the                    to buy down the price. Suppliers need to&#13;
list price of the low-e stove, the end-user                transport the stove to the household, install&#13;
price is around the price of a traditional                 it, and provide training in the proper use&#13;
stove. The price fixing of the subsidy level               of the stove. The supplier needs to provide&#13;
is expected to yield a downward trend of                   proof of payment by the household and&#13;
the list prices of low-e stoves.                           evidence that the stove is installed before&#13;
                                                           he can collect his subsidy. He can request&#13;
     Although the end-user price of low-e                  subsidy payment after a certain number of&#13;
stoves under the new subsidy mechanism                     stoves have been installed (i.e., 100). Prices&#13;
is higher, this is fully justified as other                of the stoves would need to be checked&#13;
benefits prevail that are associated to the                from time to time.&#13;
use of these stoves that could be enough&#13;
to convince them to switch: longer duration                    Option b: fixed subsidy&#13;
of the heating period of the stove on a                        This is similar to option a except that&#13;
load of coal, reduced fuel consumption/                    the subsidy level is the same for all stoves.&#13;
higher efficiency, and better heat output                  This may have the added benefit that&#13;
controllability.                                           even lower-cost stoves are identified by&#13;
                                                           suppliers. Very low-priced stoves could&#13;
                                                           occur. In addition, it is less important or&#13;
                                                           necessary to monitor stove prices.&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;    The advantage is that this system is&#13;
simple to administer. A QAA should check&#13;
part of the installations, with a larger&#13;
sample early on in the program and a&#13;
smaller sample once it is established that&#13;
the supplier operates correctly; monitoring&#13;
requirements are less stringent than under&#13;
the current program because the subsidy&#13;
level is much lower and in principle all&#13;
households are eligible. If the quality of&#13;
stoves from a certain supplier declines, he&#13;
will be warned and eventually disqualified&#13;
if the problems persist.&#13;
    Option c: incentive package&#13;
    In this scenario, support is provided&#13;
to suppliers during six month campaigns&#13;
for competitively selected stove models.&#13;
This might stimulate suppliers and keep&#13;
them alert, and it is simpler to control the&#13;
quality of the stoves. The variety of stoves&#13;
available for dissemination might be more&#13;
limited, and could change after every six&#13;
months. The price of the stoves to end-&#13;
users is likely to be lowest from the three&#13;
options.&#13;
    Six contracts are issued to the lowest&#13;
bidders, two each for three different supply&#13;
quantities over a 6 month period: 10,000&#13;
stoves, 5,000 stoves, and 1,000 stoves.&#13;
For each supply level, the supplier who&#13;
requests the lowest amount of subsidy will&#13;
be selected as well as the runner up. They&#13;
can sell their stoves during 6 months; the&#13;
sales levels are capped at the supply level&#13;
for which they submitted a bid, and they&#13;
receive their subsidy once they provided&#13;
proof of sale and installation of batches&#13;
of 100 stoves. The added advantage is&#13;
that the subsidy level may change (reduce)&#13;
after six months.&#13;

            Mongolia national low emission stove
            strategy : completing the transition to a sustainable market
            for cleaner stoves
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report on Mongolia national low
            emission stove strategy points out that Mongolia has already
            set out to achieve access to cleaner, affordable cooking and
            heating appliances in peri-urban areas of Ulaanbaatar.
            Despite initial success, a sustainable, clean stove market
            has not yet been established due to a number of challenges.
            This success came about with hard efforts. However, the
            achievements and investments are at risk for a number of
            factors discussed in this report. The risks are sufficiently
            serious that they could even reverse hard-won air quality
            improvements. This report sets out a proposed national
