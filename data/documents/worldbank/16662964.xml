&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
(i) 	 The objective of this study is to identify the reasons for               significant sanitation services although they do promote&#13;
      the existence of small-scale providers of water supply                   individual systems in many cases.&#13;

      experience of these operators, with an emphasis on their              (v)	 For this study, 14 SSP serving 50,000 people in six&#13;

      evaluation also includes proposals to improve service to                   following:&#13;
      the market traditionally served by SSP.&#13;
                                                                            â&#128;¢	 The SSP are private or communal and have often been&#13;
(ii)	 The study was divided into three phases: (a) a sector                    in operation for many years. The SSP arose because the&#13;
      assessment to determine why sector policies and financial                government and its agencies could not ensure water supply&#13;
      and institutional resources have not produced service                    services to the entire population.&#13;
      provision to the entire population, particularly to the&#13;
      segments served by SSP; (b) surveys in 14 communities                 â&#128;¢	 Most SSP collect and distribute water without quality control.&#13;
      with SSP and an analysis of responses to questions                       This poses a public health risk since only half of the water&#13;
      pertaining to legal, technical, market and financial aspects,            distributed is disinfected and service is often intermittent.&#13;
      as well as consumersâ&#128;&#153; perceptions; and (c) sector policy&#13;
      recommendations with respect to SSP, and suggestions                  â&#128;¢	 Private SSP service is expensive because the companies&#13;

                                                                               can run S/. 14 per m3, or 15 times more than those of water&#13;
(iii)	 The National Plan for the Water Supply and Sanitation                   utilities, which receive government subsidies.&#13;
       Sub-sector estimates that 6.7 million (24%) of Peruâ&#128;&#153;s 27.5&#13;
       million people do not have access to water supply services           â&#128;¢	 SSP bill average S/. 19 per month per household for water,&#13;
       and 11.8 million (43%) lack sanitation services.	                       which is equivalent to 5% of the average family income&#13;
                                                                               of customers. Both the private and community SSP are&#13;
(iv)	With a view of identifying the different types of service                 financially self-sufficient. Sixty percent of SSP income goes&#13;

     Housing carried out a rapid assessment of households&#13;
     without service in the jurisdictions of water utilities in&#13;
     October 2006. This study demonstrated that nearly 20%&#13;
     of residents in the jurisdictions of water utilities do not have&#13;
     access to the utilitiesâ&#128;&#153; service and that 30% do not have&#13;
     access to sanitation services. The assessment found that&#13;
     the population not served by utilities receives water in&#13;
     four different ways in approximately equal proportions: (a)&#13;
     tanker trucks (private SSP); (b) self-supply through springs&#13;
     and streams; (c) administrative boards (community SSP);&#13;
     and (d) other types of SSP, for example, private wells. The&#13;
     SSP provide services to an estimated three million people in&#13;
     urban areas. This figure does not include rural populations&#13;
     that may be served by SSP. Available information and the&#13;
     surveys of this study indicate that SSP do not provide&#13;

â&#128;¢	 No SSP providing sanitation services were identified. Although          the service.&#13;
   some SSP had promoted latrine systems, they did not finance,&#13;
   operate or maintain them.                                               A particular concern is that water utilities do not believe they&#13;
                                                                           have a mandate to recover operating and investment costs&#13;
The communities served by SSP report that they are                         through the tariffs. As a corollary, the tariff policy mandated&#13;
satisfied with the service provided by SSP. Ninety percent of              by the regulator, SUNASS, relies on cross subsidies. Under&#13;
respondents said they were satisfied with the quantity of water            this system, tariffs for low-income groups cover only a small&#13;
received, whereas 80% were satisfied with the quality, and                 portion of SPP costs whereas the tariffs charged to the rest of&#13;
more than half believe they pay a fair price for the service. A            consumers are not high enough to make up the difference.&#13;
high level of satisfaction with the services might be explained&#13;
by the fact that the community members are aware that SSP                  In summary, the conclusions of this study are as follows:&#13;
are the only water service providers available.&#13;
                                                                           â&#128;¢	 First: Financially weak water utilities have a strong&#13;
The surveys indicate that SSP do not have a well-established                  disincentive to carry out additional investments to&#13;

believe that the SSP service quality is inadequate although they              expanding the coverage to poor unserved areas would&#13;
also acknowledge that these providers serve groups which are                  entail a considerable financial loss to the utilities.&#13;
not served by the official utilities.&#13;
                                                                           The General Law of Sanitation Services (No. 26338 of 1994)&#13;
                                                                           establishes the basic principles for fixing utility tariffs. A key&#13;
                                                                           principle is that the tariffs should guarantee the recovery of total&#13;
                                                                           operating costs of utilities, as well as their investment costs,&#13;
                                                                           under efficient administrative conditions. One of the reasons&#13;
                                                                           why costs are not covered is that mayors in the jurisdiction&#13;
                                                                           of the utilities control tariff rates. Mayors may find it politically&#13;

&#13;
                                                                           â&#128;¢	 Second: The principle of financial viability through&#13;
                                                                              tariffs that cover the full cost of service is not being&#13;

&#13;
                                                                           The process of bringing the tariff policy in line with the law will&#13;
                                                                           require strong, on-going political support at the highest levels&#13;

&#13;
                                                                       &amp;#24;&#13;
&amp;#12;of government, including the mayors. In addition, an education&#13;
campaign for consumers and political authorities would be&#13;
needed to increase support and political buy-in.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Third: Although Ministry of Economy and Finance&#13;
   is allocating substantial resources, such growing&#13;
   resources will not necessarily ensure increased&#13;
   coverage or improved service quality.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the laws, regulations and institutions of the sector, the&#13;
decisions of the MEF, MVCS, SUNASS and the utilities are&#13;
not coordinated in a transparent manner, and responsibility&#13;
for decisions taken is diluted. In particular, the utilities do not          magnitude of unserved populaton, it is likely that SSP will&#13;
feel fully committed to and responsible for achieving service                continue to provide services for many years to come.&#13;
coverage and quality targets and central government entities&#13;
have not managed to ensure sustainable utility management.                The SSP will co-exist with utilities for many more years.&#13;
                                                                          Each has comparative advantages: because of their size,&#13;
Because the utilities are financially weak, they depend on                utilities offer economies of scale and potentially better quality&#13;
government funds to finance their investments. In theory,                 services whereas SSP have successfully responded to the&#13;
the National Public Investment System (SNIP) analyzes and                 unmet demand of the poorest population. Sector officials&#13;
approves allocation of these funds. Nevertheless, allocated               should promote cooperation between utilities and SSP to&#13;
funding and subsidies are not linked in a transparent way                 avoid market segmentation and to achieve greater synergy&#13;
to increased coverage. Nor is it clear who should receive                 in service provision. This would permit authorities to benefit&#13;
subsidies and in what amount, which makes it difficult to                 from the comparative advantages of both types of service&#13;
monitor, measure and increase the efficient use of public                 providers.&#13;
resources in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Fourth: SSP should meet the same water quality                            Recommendations&#13;

Private SSP operate without adequate regulation of service                   Services to ensure that the economic regulation of&#13;
quality and tariff structures. Despite the absence of water                  SUNASS will encourage utilities to recover the full cost&#13;

(MOH) in terms of quality, SSP customers report being quite                  incentives for utilities to incorporate â&#128;&#156;SSP segmentsâ&#128;? that&#13;
satisfied with SSP services.                                                 are currently excluded. Allowing utilities to charge the&#13;

â&#128;¢	 Fifth: SSP at least equal the utilities in terms of                       tendency of mayors to gain short-term political advantage&#13;
   performance, efficiency and sustainability. In light of the               by insisting on low, unsustainable tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      &amp;#24;&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢	 Second: Create incentives to encourage utilities to                                          	&#13;
   give top priority to supplying treated water which SSP&#13;
   would later distribute, and promote coverage of all&#13;
   unserved neighborhoods through low-cost systems&#13;
   (APPJ and/or condominial systems). To this end, the&#13;
   government should modify the regulatory framework&#13;
   and incentives to obligate utilities to connect all residents&#13;
   within their jurisdiction. Using the output-based aid (OBA)&amp;#4;&#13;
   model, utilities would be authorized to raise tariffs and&#13;
   receive financing for investment based on their progress&#13;
   in reaching service coverage targets. Also using the OBA&#13;
   system, utilities/SSP could be encouraged to promote&#13;
   and offer sanitation services. These sanitation systems&#13;
   could be individual (for example, household latrines) or&#13;
   communal (operated by SSP). There are successful cases&#13;
   of community sanitation centers operated by local SSP (for&#13;
   example, the slum sanitation centers in Mumbai, India).&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Third: Harmonize financial policies with the National&#13;
   Public Investment System (SNIP) that prioritize&#13;
   increased service coverage. A policy target of increased&#13;
   coverage such as the one announced under the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   Water for All initiative should guide the development and                                        the mandate or the resource to do so. Instead, municipal&#13;
   implementation of water supply projects, starting with                                           capacity should be strengthened to regulate SSP services&#13;
   the National Investment Fund (FNI), which is expected to                                         through contracts stipulating specific performance&#13;
   become the cornerstone of the public investment program in                                       standards. Likewise, efforts should be made to strengthen&#13;
   the sector. The financial policies of the sector must be tied to                                 the capacity of the MOH to monitor and control the quality&#13;
   policies on service coverage and quality targets; otherwise,                                     of water supplied by SSP.&#13;
   there is a risk that FNI funds will be used to subsidize those&#13;
   that have always enjoyed sector subsidies: the middle and                                    â&#128;¢	 Fifth: Establish incentives for utilities to take advantage&#13;
   upper classes that are already connected.                                                       of the experience gained by SSP in water distribution&#13;
                                                                                                   and customer relations. SSP should be partners of the&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Fourth: Regulate SSP in a manner similar to utility                                             utilities given that they offer competitive advantages.&#13;
   regulation. It cannot be justified, according to the&#13;
   surveys that, the MOH does not adequately monitor water                                      The study suggests four pilot projects that would benefit: (i)&#13;
   quality and the SUNASS does not control SSP tariffs.                                         small communities that currently supply their own water from&#13;
   Nevertheless, the SUNASS should not necessarily be                                           springs or streams or receive water from inadequate SSP&#13;
   responsible for regulating SSP given that it does not have                                   systems; (ii) peri-urban areas that currently receive water&#13;
                                                                                                from tanker trucks; and (iii) peri-urban areas through an&#13;

   would justify public funding to complement or replace user-fees. OBA involves&#13;
   delegating service delivery to a third-party, typically private firms, but also public       projects represent a progression from less satisfactory to&#13;
   utilities, NGOs, and community-based organizations, under contracts that tie                 better quality services.&#13;

&amp;#12;The first pilot project would strengthen the public sector              SSP to offer a variety of technologies. The project could fully&#13;

who have always enjoyed them: the upper and middle classes.             with approximately 1,000 good quality imported trucks. Truck&#13;
To avoid this risk, a study should be undertaken to create              owners would receive the replacement trucks after payment in&#13;
explicit incentives so that public financing be tied to increased       full and after signing a formal agreement to comply with strict&#13;
service coverage. Specifically, SNIP policies and practices             quality standards. This would also require the strengthening&#13;

Furthermore, the evaluation concluded that service quality              water distribution costs by an estimated 25%, in addition&#13;
regulations lack the momentum and coverage needed to                    to improving water quality. This project is appropriate for&#13;

certainly does not have the resources to regulate numerous&#13;
SSP. Therefore, the first project should analyze and propose&#13;
alternatives to complement and strengthen quality regulation,&#13;
possibly assigning responsibility to the municipalities where&#13;
SSP operate. Measures should be analyzed and proposed&#13;
to strengthen the capacity of the MOH and municipalities to&#13;
carry out their regulatory function, which they are currently not&#13;
exercising.&#13;

The second pilot project proposes strengthening and&#13;
expanding SSP in small communities. Under this approach,&#13;
which has been successfully tested in other Latin American              The fourth pilot project proposes replicating APPJ and/or&#13;

systems to pay SSP for serving low-income populations. The              bilateral financing. The pilot projects should encourage SSP&#13;

&amp;#12;I. Introduction&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), administered by                        The current context suggests that SSP will continue to play an&#13;
the World Bank, helps countries find sustainable solutions                     important role in a service delivery to the poorest population&#13;
to ensure efficient delivery of the quality water supply and                   for many years to come. It also underscores the urgent need&#13;
sanitation services the population demands.                                    to identify sustainable solutions that are affordable for low-&#13;
                                                                               income households.&#13;
The WSP is carrying out a systematic analysis in several&#13;
countries to identify the role of small-scale providers (SSP) of&#13;
water and sanitation services to poor populations not served&#13;
by public and private entities. The study also examines how&#13;
these operators fit in and respond to sector policies and the&#13;
organization of the sector in each country.&#13;
&#13;
In 2005, more than six million people in Peru did not have&#13;
access to satisfactory water services and 11 million did not&#13;
have adequate sanitation2. In 2015, if the targets established&#13;
in the National Sanitation Plan are met, six million people will&#13;
still be without an adequate water supply and seven million will&#13;
lack sanitation service. Low-income families will be the most&#13;
affected.&#13;
&#13;
Community and/or private initiatives have arisen in the form&#13;
of SSP to respond to the demand for service of low-income&#13;
groups. Their existence is largely ignored and is not adequately&#13;
coordinated by policy makers and service operators.&#13;
Unfortunately, the lack of effective oversight, particularly of&#13;
water quality, is evident in a water supply that does not always&#13;
safeguard public health.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, the investments required to provide service to&#13;
the population without access are significantly higher than&#13;
sector investments in recent years, a trend that will not be&#13;
easily reversed. To this end, policies should be introduced&#13;
to reform the sector, particularly in the area of financing and&#13;
tariffs. These policies should include adequate incentives to&#13;
expand service coverage to the low-income population.&#13;

all levels. This challenge includes ensuring funding (69%&#13;
of the planned budget still does not have financing) and                                 1.	 Strengthen the capacity of the central government and&#13;
streamlining administrative processes, such as contracting                                   utilities to prioritize investments.&#13;
and implementation.16&#13;

In addition, the plan should establish priorities in terms of                                COVAPS, JASS and other SSP through technical and&#13;
timetables and components to establish guidelines for decision                               financial assistance to enable them to offer better quality&#13;

Although the plan for 2015 is ambitious, it would still mean                                 responsibilities are delegated, to effectively monitor the&#13;
that approximately six million people would not have access                                  quality of water supplied by SSP.&#13;

&amp;#12;5.	 Promote the use of low-cost technologies that permit, by&#13;
    definition, reducing investment and operating costs and&#13;
    providing services to more people.&#13;
	 For example, SEDAPAL achieved successful results with&#13;
    condominial water and sanitation systems, which enabled&#13;
    low-income families to reduce their investment costs by 30%.&#13;
	 These experiences should be formally evaluated (lessons&#13;

service is even more precarious in small municipalities. In               is inadequate for ensuring clean water at the delivery point. For&#13;
addition, this indicator does not reveal that the population              example, a study carried out in 200418 in Metropolitan Lima&#13;

â&#128;¢	 The debt service of the 45 utilities is approximately US$&#13;
   1.62 billion. If the reimbursable contributions to the former&#13;
   FONAVI are excluded, the debt is reduced to approximately&#13;
   US$ 1.083 billion, US$ 601 million of which corresponds to&#13;
   SEDAPAL. These obligations translate into a debt service&#13;
   equivalent to eight years of the operational margin in the&#13;
   case of SEDAPAL and 30 years for the other utilities.24&#13;

   ratio higher than 0.8 and four have a ratio higher than 1 (do&#13;

In light of the above, it is not surprising that many cities served&#13;
by these utilities have low coverage rates, non-continuous&#13;
service and deficient service quality.&#13;

&amp;#12;III. Small-scale Providers&#13;
  1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Until the 1980s, with few exceptions (such as Colombia and&#13;
Ecuador), developing countries had created a national and&#13;
centralized organizational model for urban water supply and&#13;
sanitation services. Undoubtedly, this model was preferred&#13;
because communities and small towns lacked the necessary&#13;
financial and human resources. It was believed that a central&#13;
body could overcome these deficiencies. Thus, in Peru in the&#13;
1970s, the General Directorate of Sanitation Works (DGOS) of&#13;
the Ministry of Housing operated and built water supply and&#13;
sanitation works throughout the country (with the exception&#13;
of Lima, Arequipa and Trujillo). In 1981, a newly formed state&#13;
company, the National Water Supply and Sanitation Service&#13;
(SENAPA), replaced the DGOS. SENAPA built and operated&#13;
                                                                           about its universal application. The disillusionment of leaders&#13;
sanitation works until 1990, when its branch offices and 12&#13;
                                                                           of the water and sanitation sector with the private sector&#13;
operating units were transferred to municipalities. A similar&#13;
                                                                           arose from problems occurring, for example, in Cochabamba,&#13;
decentralization process took place in most developing&#13;
                                                                           TucumÃ¡n and later in Buenos Aires. In addition, with the tariff&#13;
countries in Latin America and other regions.&#13;
                                                                           structures imposed on the private sector, the interest of the&#13;
                                                                           private sector in providing services to the poor population was&#13;
Nevertheless, when they assumed responsibility for the&#13;
                                                                           called into question.&#13;
sanitation sector, most municipalities did not have the financial&#13;
and human resources or the specialized bodies and incentives&#13;
                                                                           In response to the stateâ&#128;&#153;s inability to provide universal service,&#13;
to effectively fulfill their new mandate. Therefore, many countries&#13;
                                                                           organizational models developed in the form of small-scale&#13;
looked to private sector participation (PSP) as an alternative&#13;
                                                                           providers (SSP), which incorporated the unquestionable&#13;
model to compensate for some of these deficiencies. Latin&#13;
                                                                           advantages of the private sector with the social concern of&#13;
America once again led this global process. Nevertheless,&#13;
                                                                           providing services to the poorest population. Different types&#13;
some negative experiences with the PSP model raised doubts&#13;
                                                                           of SSP already enjoyed a long history in large Asian and&#13;

During a rapid and uncontrolled urbanization process, the                      The 2005-2015 National Plan for the Sanitation Sector&#13;
most recent low-income inhabitants will most likely settle in                  estimates that 6.7 million of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s 27.5 million&#13;
peri-urban areas. In 1940, Peru was a predominately rural                      people, or 24%, lack water supply services from official&#13;
country, with only about a third of its population living in urban             providers, including service utilities of different sizes and&#13;
areas. Forty years later, in 1981, the proportions had reversed                other providers, such as municipal or community operators.&#13;
and in 2005, 75% of the population was classified as urban                     An even larger population does not have access to the&#13;
and 25% as rural. Both the unrelenting urbanization process                    sanitation services provided by utilities or other providers.&#13;
and urban migration affect efforts to provide water supply and                 An estimated 11.8 million, or 43% of the total population, do&#13;
sanitation services to the entire population. This observation                 not have sanitation service. Table 9 details the lack of these&#13;
is even more important considering that service unit costs                     services in Peru.&#13;

                                                                          t&#13;

                                                                              	 From springs, usually through self-supply (19%+10% =&#13;

                                                                              	 From administrative boards, which are community SSP&#13;
                                                                          t&#13;

&#13;
As noted, the lack of water supply services is inversely related                (12%+10%=22%); and&#13;
to the size of the provider in urban areas. Thus, just 11% of                 	 From other types of SSP, such as distributors of private&#13;
                                                                          t&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
the population served by SEDAPAL lack services whereas                          well water (24%).&#13;
40% of the population in the jurisdictions of smaller municipal&#13;
or community providers do not have access to services.&#13;
Likewise, the percentage of the population without sanitation&#13;
services ranges from a minimum of 16% with SEDAPAL to&#13;
67% with municipal or community providers. For both types of&#13;
service, lack of access in rural areas approaches the maximum&#13;
percentage for urban areas: 38% of rural inhabitants do not&#13;
have water services and 70% have no sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
In theory, the inability of utilities and municipal or community&#13;
providers to provide water and sanitation services to the entire&#13;
population within their jurisdictions has created a market for&#13;
SSP. The SSP compete with utilities in larger communities&#13;
as well as with different forms of self-supply by consumers&#13;

&amp;#12;The SSP are apparently quite self-sufficient when confronting&#13;
operational problems. Seventy-one percent of SSP reported&#13;
having their own operators or technicians that knew how to&#13;
repair technical problems whereas 14% said they had difficulty&#13;
finding qualified technicians when operational problems&#13;
occurred. Seventy-one percent of SSP reported that their&#13;
maintenance activities were limited to cleaning their tanks&#13;
and equipment as a preventative measure. The importance&#13;
of preventive maintenance was more evident with the tanker&#13;
trucks because operators had no source of income when their&#13;
vehicles were out of service due to mechanical problems.&#13;
&#13;
A key consideration for selecting technical alternatives is the&#13;
cost of the different types of service because of their impact on&#13;
tariff structures. The relevant cost is the so-called economic&#13;
cost, which covers two categories: operation and maintenance&#13;
(operating costs) and investment costs. The annualized cost&#13;
of investment can be calculated assuming a useful life and a               Costs of the APPJ system come from the report on water&#13;

Consumption levels are based on surveys of SSP- tanker trunks, and on estimates of the study of supply and demand for water and sanitation&#13;
services of Lima and Callao carried out by Guillermo Yepes and Klas Ringskog in April 2002 for APPJ systems, and consultantsâ&#128;&#153; estimates.&#13;
Operation and maintenance costs (S/.0.70/m3) come from the SEDAPAL system, which provides water supply services to the Siglo XXI settlement&#13;
in San Juan de Lurigancho in Lima. Estimates were made for the three APPJ, condominial and conventional systems, to make data comparable.&#13;

to the tariffs charged in the case of the APPJ, condominial&#13;
and SEDAPAL conventional systems. For example, in 2005,                      Neighborhoods were an average of 50 years old and 77% of&#13;
SEDAPAL charged a social tariff of S/. 0.97/m3 in shantytowns                consumers hold titles to their property.&#13;
for consumption through household connections. In contrast,&#13;
some tanker truckers charge customers S/. 10/m3. Comparing                   Households buy water from SSP because the public sector&#13;
the costs of the tanker truck with the SEDAPAL social tariff                 does not provide the service. The SSP were formed because&#13;
(subsidized), the tariff ratio is 10:1. However, the ratio in terms          there is no utility (54% of respondents); because the utility&#13;
of economic costs of SEDAPAL service is much lower simply                    cannot provide the service (23%); or because consumers&#13;
because the economic costs of any reticulated system are                     consider the SSP tariff more attractive (15%). Thus, in most&#13;
high when consumption is low, such as in shantytowns.                        cases, the public sector has not been able to satisfy the&#13;
                                                                             demand to which SSP are responding. In just one case, the&#13;

The household income of SSP customers ranges from S/. 200&#13;
to S/. 500 monthly, with an average of S/. 360 per month. This               The low per capita consumption of the communities surveyed&#13;

vary enormously, from S/. 1 per month per household for                     service quality.&#13;
an unmeasured service to S/. 55 per month. On average,&#13;
households pay S/. 19 per month, equivalent to 5% of                        With respect to household sanitary facilities (in the case&#13;
reported household income. Tariffs can reach levels as                      of consumers with pressurized, piped water), 100% have a&#13;
high as S/. 14 per m3, but monthly charges are low since                    shower and sink, 88% a toilet and 62% a latrine. In cases&#13;
consumption levels are very low.                                            where customers do not have pressurized water, sanitation&#13;
                                                                            facilities consist of a latrine known as a silo.&#13;
In only one case is water consumption measured, although&#13;
all tanker truck service is measured because consumers pay&#13;
for their drum (200 liters) on delivery. Thirty-eight percent of&#13;
SSP offer up to three months of credit, but most do not offer&#13;
any credit. After three months of non-payment, the service is&#13;
discontinued.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                            26 The financial working ratio is defined as the ratio between revenue collected&#13;
The SSP are generally small, with an average of 12 employees,                  and operating and maintenance costs, without considering fixed asset&#13;
and a range of between one and 64 employees. The largest                       depreciation.&#13;

                                                                       32&#13;
&amp;#12;IV. Main Conclusions&#13;
The policy analysis shows the water and sanitation sector            The process of bringing the tariff policy in line with the law will&#13;
in Peru that is highly centralized, particularly with regards        require strong, on-going political support at the highest levels&#13;
to decision making, which directly affects the performance           of government, including the mayors. In addition, an education&#13;
of companies or utilities that provide the service. The fact         campaign for consumers and political authorities would be&#13;
that tariffs do not reflect the real cost of services has            needed to increase support and political buy-in.&#13;
created a dependence on investment resources from the&#13;
national budget. Responsibility for resource allocation              Third conclusion: Although the Ministry of Economy and&#13;
falls mainly on the MEF and the MVCS. The absence of                 Finance is allocating substantial, potentially increasing&#13;
effective controls to supervise planning and the quality of          resources given the countryâ&#128;&#153;s favorable macroeconomic&#13;
investments at times leads to investments with low social,           growth, it will not be easy to ensure increased coverage&#13;
economic and financial profitability, to the detriment of            or improved service quality.&#13;
consumers, particularly the poor. This also affects the&#13;
financial soundness of utilities.&#13;
&#13;
The utilities do not believe they can recover operating and&#13;
investment costs through tariffs. The problem is compounded&#13;
by the SUNASS cross-subsidy tariff policy, in which tariffs for&#13;
the lowest-income segments do not cover more than a small&#13;
portion of costs and tariffs for high-income groups do not&#13;
make up the difference for the subsidy granted.&#13;
&#13;
First conclusion: The inevitable result of the tariff policy&#13;
is that financially weak water utilities have a strong&#13;
disincentive to carry out additional investments to&#13;
provide adequate services to the poorest households:&#13;
expanding services to those households would represent&#13;
a considerable financial loss to the utilities.&#13;
&#13;
The General Law of Sanitation Services (No. 26338 of 1994)&#13;
establishes basic guidelines for setting utility tariffs. A key&#13;
guideline is that the tariffs must guarantee the recovery of&#13;
total costs and expenses incurred by the providers, as well as&#13;
their investments, under efficient administrative conditions.&#13;
This problem is perpetuated in part because mayors control&#13;
tariffs in the jurisdictions of municipal utilities. Therefore, it&#13;
is difficult for government officials and their constituents to&#13;
implement tariffs in the spirit of the law.&#13;
&#13;
Second conclusion: The principle of financial viability&#13;
through recovering the full costs of service is not being&#13;
met, in violation of the law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                33&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           Private SSP operate without adequate regulation of their&#13;
                                                                           service quality and tariffs. Despite this lack of regulation,&#13;
                                                                           which for water quality is the responsibility of the MOH, SSP&#13;
                                                                           customers are satisfied with SSP services.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           Fifth conclusion: The SSP at least equal the utilities in&#13;
                                                                           terms of performance, efficiency and sustainability. In&#13;
                                                                           light of the large unmet demand for services, it is likely&#13;
                                                                           that SPP will continue to provide services for many years&#13;
                                                                           to come.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           In Peru, SSP may be private (such as tanker truck service) or&#13;
                                                                           communal (such as JASS). Both have arisen from the inability&#13;
                                                                           of the Peruvian government and its agencies to provide&#13;
                                                                           services to certain population segments.&#13;
&#13;
Despite adequate laws, regulations and institutions of the                 Many SSP have long played a key socioeconomic role but&#13;
sector, the coordination between the MEF, MVCS, SUNASS                     without the due integration with other entities of the sector and&#13;
and the utilities is not clear, for which reason responsibility for        without enjoying the same government financial support as&#13;
the decisions taken has been diluted. In particular, the utilities         the utilities and many JASS.&#13;
do not feel fully committed to and responsible for achieving&#13;
coverage and service quality targets and any improvements of               Sixth conclusion: The utilities and SSP should cooperate&#13;
utility management have not been sustainable.                              with one another rather than segment the markets&#13;
                                                                           by working separately. In this way, the comparative&#13;
Given their financial weakness, the utilities depend on                    advantages of both types of service could be exploited.&#13;
government resources to finance their investments. In theory,&#13;
the SNIP is responsible for analyzing and approving these                  The utilities and SSP will co-exist for many years to come.&#13;
fund allocations. Nevertheless, the funds and subsidies                    Both possess comparative advantages: because of their size,&#13;
allocated are not transparently linked to quantitative objectives          utilities offer economies of scale and potentially better quality&#13;
of increased coverage, nor is it clear who should receive                  services whereas SSP have successfully responded to the&#13;
subsidies and in what amount. This makes it difficult to                   unmet demand of the lowest-income sectors.&#13;
monitor and raise the efficiency of the use of public resources&#13;
in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Fourth conclusion: The SSP should meet the same&#13;
water quality standards as the water utilities. Moreover,&#13;
the regulation of water quality and consumption&#13;
practices should be even more rigorous than for general&#13;
population, because low quality service poses greater&#13;
health risks to the socioeconomically disadvantaged&#13;
groups traditionally served by SSP.&#13;

&amp;#12;V. Policy Recommendations&#13;
Introduction                                                               First recommendation: Implement tariff and regulatory&#13;
Through its Water For All program, the Peruvian government                 policies to enable and create incentives for the utilities to&#13;

                                                                           would require eliminating many biases and practices. The&#13;

This sequential policy analysis is essential for understanding                question is: Why do higher-income groups pay lower&#13;
why policies may not produce the promised or expected                         tariffs than slum dwellers?&#13;

needed to implement them. A similar case is differentiating                   likely to reduce the level of unaccounted-for water, thereby&#13;
between what the government promises and what it actually                     benefiting the financial situation of utilities. This is because&#13;

Peru. The general observation is that Peru has managed to                     increase substantially with cost-covering tariffs which&#13;
create the necessary instruments to reform the water and                      would stimulate utilities to convert lost cubic meters into&#13;
sanitation sector but the government has failed to implement                  paying ones.&#13;

&amp;#12;Second recommendation: Create incentives for utilities                 Investment Fund (FNI) to connecting the entire population. If&#13;
to prioritize supplying service to the unserved and cover              sector financial policies are not tied to service coverage and&#13;
all unserved neighborhoods with low-cost systems (APPJ                 quality targets, FNI funds run the risk of being used to subsidize&#13;
and/or condominial systems) as soon as possible.                       those who have always enjoyed subsidies: the middle and&#13;
                                                                       upper classes that are already connected.&#13;
Comment: Currently, utility executives often focus first on&#13;
capturing, treating and distributing water, and only second            Fourth recommendation: SSP should be regulated, at least&#13;
on connecting households. This focus makes utilities lose              in terms of tariffs and water quality, in a manner similar to&#13;
sight of the goal of connecting the entire population. The             utilities. As a corollary, SSP within the jurisdictions of utilities&#13;
proof is that after many decades, populations served by SSP            should be obliged to obtain water from utilities, if the latter&#13;
are still without access to utility services. The government           can supply it, thereby ensuring water quality control.&#13;
should modify the regulatory framework and incentives to&#13;

proposed adjustment of the tariff structure.                           the SUNASS in terms of tariffs. The arguments that resources&#13;

Connecting the entire population within the jurisdiction of the        not valid since the absence of controls threatens the health of&#13;
utilities is feasible given that: (a) the necessary increase in        a large part of the Peruvian population. Once the regulatory&#13;
terms of drinking water is minimal given the low levels of             system is in place â&#128;&#147;most likely under the responsibility of&#13;
consumption of the unconnected population. In a city with a            municipalities and the MOH rather than SUNASSâ&#128;&#147; SSP should&#13;
current coverage rate of 90%, incorporating unconnected                be given financial and technical assistance to enable them to&#13;
households would increase total consumption by less than 3%.           meet water quality standards. According to the surveys, none&#13;
Incorporating the unconnected 20% (if coverage is just 80%)            of the private SSP has access to credit, most likely because&#13;

SSP to distribute water in unserved neighborhoods.&#13;

Third recommendation: Harmonize financial policies with                experience acquired by SSP in water distribution and&#13;
the National Public Investment System (SNIP) to ensure                 customer relations, SSP and the utilities should work&#13;
that water supply projects are prioritized in terms of                 together as partners to support the unserved population.&#13;
increasing the connected population.&#13;
&#13;
Comment: Applying output based aid would facilitate efforts&#13;
to ensure universal service connection. Under this system,&#13;
utilities would receive authorization for tariff increases and&#13;
funding for works based on the progress made in connecting&#13;
households.&#13;
&#13;
To meet this objective, financial policies would have to be&#13;
developed to focus the use of resources of the National&#13;

&amp;#12;VI. Pre-identified priority projects&#13;
The growth of the Peruvian economy will allow higher                        policy adjustments will be more feasible if they are combined&#13;
investments in the water supply and sanitation sector. This                 with investment projects. To this end, the consultants have&#13;

contribute to resolving the problem of the population without               investments with policy adjustments and strengthening, as&#13;
service. This study proposes four pilot projects appropriate                described below.&#13;
for external financing. However, these projects could be&#13;
implemented just as well with national funds, without the need              First pilot project: Strengthening the public sector to&#13;
for outside aid.                                                            optimize the regulatory system in support of increased&#13;
                                                                            coverage of water and sanitation services.&#13;
Any project proposed should seek to improve service to the&#13;
market traditionally served by SSP or that could be served by               Comment: The evaluation found that the regulatory system&#13;
SSP. This involves classifying projects by the types of service             does not comply with the spirit of General Law of Sanitation&#13;
that would have to be provided to the 6.7 million Peruvians                 Services (No. 26338 of 1994) in terms of the recovery of&#13;

                                                                         â&#128;¢	 Private or community SPP could bid to provide services&#13;
financing with increased service coverage. Specifically, the                to individual or groups of rural communities or peri-urban&#13;
study could analyze and propose regulations within the SNIP                 communities;&#13;
to prioritize service expansion.                                         â&#128;¢	 The benefiting community would agree to pay a maximum&#13;
                                                                            tariff for the service;&#13;
Furthermore, the evaluation concluded that service quality               â&#128;¢	 Sub-project bids would be awarded based on the lowest&#13;
regulations lack the momentum and reach needed to regulate                  subsidy required per beneficiary to make the project&#13;
the SSP service quality. In addition, the SUNASS does not                   financially viable. The subsidy would be the difference&#13;
possess the resources to regulate numerous SPP. Therefore,                  between the capitalized value of the payment to the SSP&#13;
the first project should analyze and propose alternatives                   and the capitalized value of the payments agreed upon with&#13;
to complement and strengthen quality regulation, possibly                   customers;&#13;
assigning responsibility to the municipalities where SPP&#13;
operate. Measures should be analyzed and proposed to&#13;
strengthen the capacity of the MOH and the municipalities to&#13;
carry out their regulatory function, which they are currently not&#13;
doing.&#13;
&#13;
The second, third, and fourth pilot projects would benefit: (i)&#13;
small urban and rural communities, which currently supply&#13;
themselves from springs or streams; (ii) peri-urban zones that&#13;
receive water service from tanker trucks; and (iii) peri-urban&#13;
areas with services similar to the APPJ that were successfully&#13;
implemented in Lima in the late 1990s, or to the condominial&#13;
services implemented in Lima in recent years. Thus, the three&#13;
pre-identified investment pilot projects correspond to the&#13;
three categories of the SSP service for the population without&#13;
access to utilities.&#13;

   both cases, the Peruvian government would finance the                possibility would be to introduce contracting of sanitation&#13;
   subsidies in accordance with the schedule of payments in             services, at least as a pilot program given the novelty of the&#13;
   the SSP proposal;                                                    concept. Ideally, OBA systems could be used to pay the&#13;

This type of competitive procedure stimulates the development           of water and sanitation systems. The project should not&#13;

the traditional systems for preparing, building and operating           could be partially or fully subsidized on the condition that&#13;
water systems in these communities (such as the PRONASAR,               beneficiaries would pay all operating and maintenance costs&#13;
for example), this project would have the major advantage of            to achieve sustainability of the systems.&#13;

&amp;#12;The cost percentages are typical for a truck that is almost&#13;
depreciated. The profitability of this service is precarious&#13;
because the market can disappear if the utility installs a&#13;
network; the truck is unreliable because it may require&#13;
considerable, unexpected repairs; and because other tanker&#13;
trucks may offer service in the area, driving down tariff prices.&#13;
&#13;
Given the modest gross margins of a tanker truck business,&#13;
it is unlikely that owners would be able to replace their vehicles.&#13;
Until recently, used trucks could be imported, but now it&#13;
is illegal to import vehicles over two years old. In addition,&#13;
import duties are prohibitive at 70%. Currently, already&#13;
obsolete tanker trucks are not replaced, negatively affecting&#13;
profitability, service reliability and the environment.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, used trucks are available abroad.                                  incremental costs of regulation and consolidate the financial&#13;
Environmental demands have escalated quickly, forcing                                situation of truckers;&#13;

their vehicles even though they are not old and even though                          truck owners would comit themselves to purchase water&#13;
they already meet strict environmental standards.                                    from regulated water sources, mainly from the utilities, and&#13;

Therefore, a project is proposed for the mass replacement                         â&#128;¢	 The Peruvian government would have to authorize the&#13;
of the obsolete water tankers. Assuming that each tanker                             importation of duty-free vehicles;&#13;

approximately 1,000 tanker trucks. Replacing these with                              financing, for example, from countries that manufacture&#13;
second-hand vehicles no more than five years old would be                            trucks, such as Germany, Brazil, Holland or Sweden, to&#13;

&amp;#12;from an existing SEDAPAL network or from tanker trucks.                 Another advantage of the APPJ systems is their lower cost&#13;
The key to the success of APPJ systems is the participation of          as compared with tanker trucks. Distribution costs of APPJ&#13;
the beneficiary communities, which contribute manual labor              systems are approximately 40% of those of tanker trucks. The&#13;
for building the system, equivalent to 20% of the value of              comparison clearly shows that tanker trucks are expensive for&#13;
the system. Equally important, communities are responsible              water distribution, even though they are necessary to initially&#13;
for the operation and maintenance of the system, and form               provide water in newly established settlements.&#13;

The APPJ systems are community SSP and represent the                    areas of Lima and other cities. Delegating system operation and&#13;
next step in water service after distribution by tanker trucks.         maintenance to the community, and making the community&#13;
The advantages are clear: the social capital of the community           the owner of the water system, continues to be an effective&#13;

to those who have the greatest interest in operating and                served by tanker trucks, other SSP and different types of self-&#13;
maintaining the system in a sustainable manner. The systems             supply could potentially benefit from APPJ systems.&#13;
are suitable for subsequent investments to the water supply&#13;
system, such as a sewerage system. (In the first stage, latrines        The APPJ systems represent a low-cost alternative for&#13;
are generally built). The APPJ system also can be combined              providing service to these populations. Condominial systems&#13;
with private and sub-contracted SSP to operate and maintain             could also be considered, as well as other systems to serve&#13;
the system. The APPJ system also can be combined with the               these disadvantaged groups, depending on their technical&#13;
condominial approach.                                                   and economic feasibility.&#13;

            Evaluation of small-scale providers of
            water supply and sanitation services in Peru
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP),
            administered by the World Bank, helps countries find
            sustainable solutions to ensure efficient delivery of the
            quality water supply and sanitation services the population
            demands. The WSP is carrying out a systematic analysis in
            several countries to identify the role of small-scale
            providers (SSP) of water and sanitation services to poor
            populations not served by public and private entities. The
            study also examines how these operators fit in and respond
            to sector policies and the organization of the sector in
            each country. The objective of this study is to identify the
            reasons for the existence of small-scale providers of water
            SSP in Peru and to evaluate the experience of these
            operators, with an emphasis on their coverage, service
            quality, costs and sustainability. The evaluation also
            includes proposals to improve service to the market
            traditionally served by SSP. The study was divided into
            three phases: (a) a sector assessment to determine why
            sector policies and financial and institutional resources
            have not produced service provision to the entire
            population, particularly to the segments served by SSP; (b)
            surveys in 14 communities with SSP and an analysis of
            responses to questions pertaining to legal, technical,
            market and financial aspects, as well as consumers'
            perceptions; and (c) sector policy recommendations with
            respect to SSP, and suggestions for priority projects to
            support better service delivery.
