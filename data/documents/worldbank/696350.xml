REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA&#13;
SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
BORROWER:           Republic of Bulgaria&#13;
BENEFICIARIES:    Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA), National Social Security&#13;
Institute (NSSI).&#13;
LOAN AMOUNT:   US$24.3 million equivalent&#13;
TERMS:              Twenty years, including a five-year grace period, at the IBRD standard&#13;
variable interest rate.&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
OBJECTIVES:         The overall goal of the Social Insurance Administration Project is to support&#13;
and sustain the Government's social insurance reform program. Specifically,&#13;
the project aims to support Government's current reform goals of eliminating&#13;
the budgetary subsidy for social insurance payments due through the&#13;
achievement of fiscal balance in the Social Insurance Fund and laying the&#13;
groundwork for future reforms aimed at more fundamental restructuring of&#13;
Bulgaria's system for guaranteeing income security through social insurance.&#13;
Therefore, the project will: (a) strengthen efforts to increase NSSI's overall&#13;
operational efficiency in today's emerging market economy, with a focus on&#13;
reversing the trend towards reduced tax compliance which is undermining the&#13;
financial stability of the public Pay-As-You-Go social insurance program; and&#13;
(b) strengthen the institutional capacity of the newly created NSSI to perform&#13;
key policy formulation and evaluation functions and better manage resources.&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
ESCRIPTIQN:         The proposed project will provide financing for computer and&#13;
telecommunications hardware and software, fellowships, study tours, foreign&#13;
and local training and expert advisory services, public education materials,&#13;
office upgrading, and incremental recurrent costs. The estimated total cost of&#13;
the project is US$32.3 million, of which US$24.3 million will be financed by&#13;
the Bank loan. The project will be implemented over a period of four years by&#13;
NSSI, and will consist of two components:&#13;
Increasing Compliance and Operational Efficiency (estimated base cost&#13;
US$25.8 million). This component is aimed at instituting effective operational&#13;
procedures for inter alia: (a) control and monitoring of the flow of funds into&#13;
and out of the social insurance system; (b) improved revenue/expenditure&#13;
projection and the calculation of benefits on the basis of actual contribution;&#13;
and (c) improved services to clients, including efficient payment of pensions&#13;
and short-term benefits. Improvements in each of these areas will be achieved&#13;
through creation of an integrated Social Insurance Information System (SIS),&#13;
based on the institution of a unique identifier for each individual and&#13;
enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
Strengthening Institutional Capacity (estimated base cost US$ 2.8 million).&#13;
This component is designed to support the functioning of the newly created&#13;
NSSI and especially to add institutional capacity to conduct functions that were&#13;
previously less important, including: (a) policy analysis; (b) actuarial&#13;
forecasting; (c) public information/education concerning the social insurance&#13;
program and (d) personnel management, including improvements in staff&#13;
selection, incentives, and training and career development.&#13;
BENEFITS:             The project's major benefit is its expected impact on social insurance fund&#13;
balances. The ratio of the net gain in revenue to the cost of the loan is 15.2 to&#13;
1 in the year 2000 (the first year that benefits from the new system can be&#13;
expected), even under pessimistic assumptions concerning project impact on&#13;
the tax compliance rate, and 92.8 to 1 if more optimistic assumptions are&#13;
adopted. The internal rate of return to the loan in the year 2004 is estimated&#13;
to be 38.5 percent, or 70 percent, depending on whether pessimistic or&#13;
optimistic assumptions are used, compared to a nominal interest rate of 24.25&#13;
percent. The pessimistic scenario assumes that fund revenues would increase&#13;
by 1 percent relative to the base case as a result of project activities, while the&#13;
optimistic scenario assumes a 10 percent increase in revenues, a level&#13;
commensurate with that achieved through similar projects in other countries.&#13;
Two other project benefits cannot be quantified easily but are noteworthy&#13;
nonetheless. The first of these benefits is the reduction of the administrative&#13;
burden on employers (and improved services to program clients) as a result of&#13;
the project-supported transfer of responsibilities for social insurance record-&#13;
keeping from employers to NSSI. The second benefit is the improved policy&#13;
framework for social insurance that is expected to result from project inputs to&#13;
strengthen NSSI's actuarial forecasting and policy formulation capacity.&#13;
RISKS:                The project's main risk derives from NSSI's relatively weak overall&#13;
institutional capacity and, especially, its limited experience with externally-&#13;
funded projects. To strengthen the institutional capacity and minimize this&#13;
risk, Project Coordination Unit staff will be trained in project management&#13;
prior to loan effectiveness. Further, the project will provide to NSSI staff,&#13;
extensive training related to each project component. The exceptional&#13;
commitment of Government to this project also reduces the implementation&#13;
risk. A second risk is that Government's incentives to proceed with reform of&#13;
the broader policy framework will be reduced as project implementation will&#13;
begin prior to the enactment of Government's anticipated structural pension&#13;
reform. The project's support for the establishment of permanent actuarial and&#13;
policy offices within NSSI, however, can be expected to reduce this risk by&#13;
broadening the policy dialogue beyond a few top officials and strengthening&#13;
the technical underpinnings of specific reform proposals. A third risk which&#13;
could affect the project's impact is the concern that Government failure to&#13;
address some crucial short-term macroeconomic issues could destabilize the&#13;
economy. This risk cannot be reduced through project actions, but given the&#13;
relatively long lead-time before project impact is expected (34 years from&#13;
now), it is hoped that Government will have been able to bring the economy&#13;
back under control by that time.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA&#13;
SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1          In the first four years after it embarked on its transition to a market economy,&#13;
Bulgaria experienced a more prolonged and deeper recession than most of its Central and Eastern&#13;
European (CEE) neighbors, characterized by a 30 percent decline in output, sharp deterioration of&#13;
external trade flows and a high rate of unemployment, which reached about 15 percent at its peak in&#13;
early 1994. As might be expected in this context, many Bulgarian households suffered tremendous&#13;
welfare shocks during the period, due, inter alia, to soaring inflation, job (and, hence, income)&#13;
losses, and the shrinking budget envelope which forced substantial real reductions in Government's&#13;
income transfers to beneficiaries of social protection programs. Although caused in large part by&#13;
external factors - the disintegration of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the Gulf War,&#13;
and international embargoes on neighbors and trading partners - Bulgaria's prolonged recession was&#13;
also attributable to internal political instability and the failure of successive governments to steadily&#13;
maintain favorable macroeconomic policies after an initial burst of reform in 1991. Nonetheless,&#13;
1995 indicators suggested that the economy was beginning slowly to recover. In 1995, output rose&#13;
for a second consecutive year, unemployment declined (although it still remains high, at around 11&#13;
percent), inflationary pressures were receding and foreign exchange reserves were relatively&#13;
comfortable. While some improvements also occurred in the living standards of Bulgarian households&#13;
during 1995, these were insufficient to offset the severe declines of the preceding years.&#13;
1.2          At the present time, there is concern that the economic recovery remains very fragile.&#13;
1995's stabilization gains are likely to prove transitory unless bold structural reforms are undertaken&#13;
to: (i) accelerate privatization; (ii) initiate banking sector reform; (iii) impose financial discipline on&#13;
state enterprises; and (iv) reorient and further reduce government expenditures. In the first three of&#13;
these areas, Government is in the process of designing a package of policy reforms, the details of&#13;
which remain to be formulated/evaluated to assess their likely impact on placing the economy on a&#13;
sustainable growth path. Further information concerning reform efforts in the enterprise and financial&#13;
sectors is available in a number of Bank documents, including the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),&#13;
presented to the Board in April 1996. Reform efforts in the fourth area are closely linked to&#13;
developments in Bulgaria's extensive social protection system - whose expenditures constituted&#13;
roughly one-third of total Government spending (about 15% of GDP) in 1995. However, to the&#13;
extent that expenditures on social protection programs have continued to adjust endogenously, due to&#13;
partial and ad hoc indexing for inflation throughout the transition period, actual benefits per recipient&#13;
are now relatively low (below half their 1990 levels in real terms), so that further across-the-board&#13;
reductions would be difficult to implement without jeopardizing the programs' fundamental objective&#13;
of acting as a safety net for vulnerable groups. This, in turn, means that radical reform of long-&#13;
established eligibility criteria and program administration will need to be implemented if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
Government's objectives of long-run financial viability, "fairness" to program participants, and&#13;
protection of the needy are all to be met.&#13;
1.3            The Government is well aware of the need for structural reform in the country's&#13;
social protection system and, mindful of political realities, is formulating a carefully phased program&#13;
for change. Within social protection, its primary focus thus far has been on social insurance -- an&#13;
appropriate priority, given that expenditures on social insurance programs account for over 80 percent&#13;
of total social protection spending (see para. 1.6 below) and have the most far-reaching impact on the&#13;
welfare of Bulgarian households. Issues in social protection -- especially social insurance -- together&#13;
with Government plans for reform, are discussed in some detail in Sections B and C below as they&#13;
form the background to the project proposed later in this report.&#13;
B. Social Protection in Bulgaria - An Overview&#13;
1.4           As in other Eastern and Central European countries, the pre-transition Bulgarian state&#13;
provided the country's population with high income security -- principally through guaranteed&#13;
employment, cash transfers for children and the old, and special institutional and cash assistance&#13;
programs for the small proportion of the population unable to work due to long-term illness, disability&#13;
or the like. With the exception of guaranteed employment, this system of cradle-to-grave benefits and&#13;
services, predicated on compressed wages and higher-than-warranted labor force participation rates,&#13;
remains essentially intact today (though its effectiveness has been eroded by inflation), despite the&#13;
markedly different political and economic environment prevailing in the country. Furthermore, since&#13;
the start of the transition, the existing, essentially unreconstructed, system of social benefits has been&#13;
overlaid with new, "western" categories of transfers, such as unemployment benefits and new types of&#13;
social assistance, to help households cope with the unprecedented shocks stemming from economic&#13;
reform.&#13;
1.5           Not only have the number of social protection programs increased since the start of&#13;
the transition, but the number of people receiving income support from these programs has also&#13;
increased dramatically. For example, from 1990 to 1992, the number of new pensioners averaged&#13;
around 186,000 per year, due both to the normal increase in retirement associated with economic&#13;
contraction/falling labor demand as well as a government policy of offering early retirement to those&#13;
laid off by restructuring firms. Reversal of this policy in 1993 has slowed down the pressure placed&#13;
by new retirees on the pension system (with numbers of new pensioners falling since 1993 in relation&#13;
to the 1991/92 peak), but the current stock of pensioners still remains high at 2.5 million pensioners&#13;
in 1995 as against an employed population of about 3 million1' in the formal (and, hence, tax-paying)&#13;
sector. The numbers of persons registering for benefits at unemployment offices also showed&#13;
1' The potential workforce is 3.6 million according to the 1994 Labor Force Survey, implying that about&#13;
600,000 persons in the working ages are seeking but have not secured employment. In addition, the survey&#13;
found about 3.1 million people between 15-64 years (or 47 % of the age group) who were outside the labor force&#13;
(i.e., not employed and not seeking work). While many of these are likely to be students, retirees, home-&#13;
makers and discouraged workers, it is estimated that about a third of them, or about 1 million persons, are&#13;
engaged in productive, remunerative activity in the informal, generally non-tax-paying sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
dramatic increases from 1990 through 1993, rising from about 58,000 in 1990 to 601,000 in 1993&#13;
before beginning to fall gradually. However, the proportion of registrants actually deemed eligible&#13;
for, and paid, cash benefits is relatively lower and has been falling in the past 2-3 years - from a&#13;
peak of 57 percent of registrants in 1991 to 32 percent of registrants in 1994. In addition, since the&#13;
passage of the Social Assistance Law in 1992, a significant number of Bulgarian&#13;
households/individuals are registering for benefits under this category of transfers. In 1992, about&#13;
810,000 social assistance clients received some form (often a one-time only grant) of cash assistance&#13;
with the number falling to around 550,000 in 1994, principally due to budgetary constraints at the&#13;
local level to which the financial responsibility for social assistance was transferred in 1993. Finally,&#13;
it should be noted that family allowances for children up to 18 years (or longer in the case of&#13;
students) continue to be paid to social insurance contributors and clients of unemployment and social&#13;
assistance offices.&#13;
1.6            Taken together, the three main social protection programs discussed above - social&#13;
insurance (including pensions and short-term insurance for illness/maternity), unemployment&#13;
(including cash benefits and active labor redeployment programs) and social assistance (covering cash&#13;
benefits, in-kind services and family allowances) -- are enormous in coverage, providing about 80&#13;
percent of Bulgarian households with some form of income transfer. Currently, total social protection&#13;
expenditures account for about 15 percent of GDP or about 30 percent of total public expenditures,&#13;
with pensions and short-term insurance benefits alone accounting for slightly over 12 percent of GDP.&#13;
Other programs are relatively much smaller, with social assistance (including family allowances which&#13;
form the larger portion) accounting for about 2 percent of GDP and unemployment benefits&#13;
accounting for the remainder. Financing for the social assistance programs is derived entirely from&#13;
general state and municipal budgetary resources, for the unemployment programs solely from&#13;
earmarked 5 percent payroll contributions by employers, and for social insurance programs through a&#13;
combination of payroll taxes on employers (averaging about 40% per worker) and budgetary&#13;
financing to cover what have been ever-increasing deficits over the past four years. In 1994,&#13;
budgetary support for the shortfall in social insurance revenues from earmarked payroll taxes was&#13;
around 1.5 percent of GDP.&#13;
1.7            This extensive social protection system, as currently structured, has serious&#13;
implications for sustainable and equitable growth. In the first instance, projections made using an&#13;
economic and demographic model indicate that, in the absence of any restructuring, support from the&#13;
general budget for social protection expenditures would have to grow from its 1994 level of 3.5-4.0&#13;
percent of GDP (social assistance plus social insurance deficits) to an estimated 5-6 percent of GDP in&#13;
the medium-term, even if Governmnent withstands pressures to raise the real value of benefits. This, in&#13;
turn, could contribute to unsustainable fiscal deficits and/or crowding out of needed investments in&#13;
infrastructure and human capital, with detrimental consequences for growth. Secondly, in Bulgaria,&#13;
as elsewhere, cash transfer programs and the high payroll taxes imposed to finance them have&#13;
contributed to disincentives for both work and job creation in the formal sector, contributing to rapid&#13;
informalization of the economy (with consequences extending well beyond the social protection&#13;
system itself). Bulgaria's low mandatory retirement ages have exacerbated the problem, as workers&#13;
forced to retire at still-productive ages offer their services in the informal economy. Finally, there is&#13;
some indication that, extensive as they are, the social protection programs may no longer be fulfilling&#13;
adequately the basic function of poverty reduction, due to poor targeting and constrained budgets.&#13;

C. The Social Insurance Program - Background. Recent Trends and Key Issues&#13;
Background&#13;
1.8           General Features. First instituted over 45 years ago, Bulgaria's pay-as-you-go&#13;
(PAYG) social insurance program is now well-entrenched as an integral feature of the population's&#13;
strategies for coping with adversity. Primarily functioning as an insurance program, the Social&#13;
Security Fund (SSF), financed mainly through payroll taxes, provides pensions for the aged, disabled&#13;
and survivors and short-term benefits for workers temporarily unable to work due to ill health or&#13;
maternity and child-care obligations.Y In addition, the social insurance program also performs some&#13;
poverty relief or so-called "social assistance" functions, including payment of child allowances to&#13;
contributors and payment of social pensions to elderly citizens whose work histories would not&#13;
otherwise entitle them to earned pensions. While in theory, these latter payments are intended to be&#13;
financed entirely from general revenues via state budget contributions to the SSF, the current practice&#13;
of not clearly itemizing budgetary allocations according to their purpose (i.e., social assistance,&#13;
payroll tax contributions for state employees, deficit financing, etc.) makes it difficult to determine&#13;
the degree to which they are so covered. In fact, due to the continued integration of the SSF with&#13;
general revenue accounts, it is virtually impossible to establish the level of SSF revenues or, indeed,&#13;
the actual level of state budget subsidy to the SSF, with complete precision.&#13;
1.9           Organization and Management. Until early 1996, overall responsibility for&#13;
management of the social insurance program rested with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs&#13;
(MOLSA) - and within MOLSA, with the central General Directorate of Social Insurance (GDSI)&#13;
and 28 regional social insurance offices. As such, the MOLSA was charged with: (i) setting&#13;
operational policies/guidelines for the program within the framework of the 1950 Pension Law (and&#13;
other relevant legislation); (ii) formulating/initiating needed legislative changes; (iii) monitoring and&#13;
controlling the collection of payroll tax contributions from employers and the payment to them of&#13;
short-term benefits; (iv) auditing of employer records; (v) receiving and reviewing work and salary&#13;
histories of workers on the threshold of retirement and determining their eligibility for, and level of,&#13;
pension upon retirement; (vi) ensuring regular payment of pensions in cooperation with the postal&#13;
service and selected banks; (vii) handling complaints received from program contributors and&#13;
beneficiaries; and (viii) maintaining program statistics for reporting and policy development purposes.&#13;
1.10          Government has shifted the responsibility for management of the social insurance&#13;
program from the MOLSA to a newly-created autonomous institution -- the National Social Security&#13;
Institute (NSSI) - the legislative basis for the formation of which, and for separation of the SSF from&#13;
the state budget, was put in place in November 1995. While intended eventually to manage all of&#13;
Bulgaria's social insurance programs (including unemployment, workers' compensation and health&#13;
insurance, if introduced), the NSSI, in the first instance, is assuming responsibility for the existing&#13;
1 Because unemployment did not exist in the pre-transition period, unemployment insurance was not part of the&#13;
social insurance program. Although unemployment insurance does now exist, the program remains small and is&#13;
managed separately from pensions and short-term benefits. Health insurance, a key element of social insurance&#13;
systems in many European countries, has not yet been introduced in Bulgaria, where health expenditures continue&#13;
to be financed directly from general revenues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
social insurance program and the SSF. To ensure a smooth transition, the core of NSSI has been&#13;
formed by the transfer of the GDSI and regional social insurance offices (including all staff and other&#13;
resources) from MOLSA to NSSI. This transfer of staff and resources took place during the first&#13;
quarter of 1996, once NSSI became formally operational -- i.e., following approval by Parliament of&#13;
NSSI's Governor and tripartite Supervisory Board (representing Government, employers and labor).&#13;
A more detailed description of NSSI, including a draft organogram, is given in Annex 1. The&#13;
rationale for, and expected benefits from, the establishment of NSSI are discussed in connection with&#13;
the Government's overall reform strategy in para. 1.23 below.&#13;
1.11          Administrative Processes. The administrative procedures employed in the&#13;
management of the social insurance program have been inherited from the communist period and,&#13;
thus far, little has been done to modify them to accord with market economic conditions. At present,&#13;
NSSI maintains no records on employed workers, their salary/wage histories or contribution levels.&#13;
Rather, employers are obliged to record on a regular basis work, salary and contributions information&#13;
in the workbooks of individual employees, only certifying the information (including the wage levels&#13;
to be used for pension calculations) and forwarding it to the relevant regional social insurance office&#13;
when the worker is on the threshold of retirement. Thereupon, the regional office verifies the&#13;
information given in the worker's paper records to the extent feasible and forwards it to the central&#13;
NSSI office (formerly GDS1) in Sofia where a pension calculation is made and relevant data from the&#13;
new pensioner's records are added to a central computerized data base containing similar records for&#13;
existing pensioners. On a monthly basis, payment lists are generated from the central data base&#13;
containing information on pensioners and the amounts of their pensions. In turn, these lists are&#13;
forwarded, through the regional offices, to the relevant post offices and banks where pensioners are&#13;
able to collect their pensions in person-', in cash, upon presentation of appropriate identification. One&#13;
transition-related innovation in these otherwise unmodified administrative procedures concerns a 1992&#13;
decision to maintain records on a new category of contributors, self-employed entrepreneurs, within&#13;
the NSSI/GDSI central data base. However, the procedures currently in place for monthly verification&#13;
of earnings and related contributions for self-employed entrepreneurs are extremely time-consuming&#13;
and onerous, and constitute a serious disincentive for registering with the system.&#13;
1.12          As with maintenance/reporting of pension records, the existing system also places&#13;
heavy reliance on employers' honesty in the collection of payroll tax contributions and the payment of&#13;
short-term benefits and child allowances. At present, employers simply calculate their own payroll&#13;
tax obligations to the SSF, deduct the short-term benefits and child allowance amounts that they deem&#13;
to be payable to their employees from the SSF, and deposit the remainder to the appropriate&#13;
MOF/SSF accounts in designated banks. Employers are not required to furnish the bank or the social&#13;
insurance offices with the details of their calculations, nor, in most cases, do banks provide the&#13;
relevant regional social insurance office with prompt statements concerning the source and amount of&#13;
deposits received. Although employers are subject to audit, and the social insurance system maintains&#13;
an audit service, audits are conducted almost exclusively on a scheduled basis, in theory at least, for&#13;
all employers, with no effort to target. In fact, the frequency of even these scheduled audits is&#13;
probably falling, given the large (and growing) number of employers and a limited number of&#13;
auditors. While this collection/benefit payment system has the virtue of being relatively simple and&#13;
unbureaucratic, its inability to monitor and control compliance with tax obligations and benefits&#13;
' Special arrangements for pension pick-up are available for invalids and the disabled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
deductions effectively invites evasion by a growing private sector in pursuit of profit maximization&#13;
(see para. 1.19 below).&#13;
Recent Trends and Key Issues&#13;
1.13          Declining Ratio of Contributors to Pensioners. As already alluded to in the&#13;
preceding sections, Bulgaria's social insurance program has been under considerable financial stress in&#13;
the transition period. In part, this is a direct consequence of the country's aging demographic profile&#13;
- over 21 percent of the population is aged 60 years or older -- implying that a relatively small&#13;
number of workers must support a large population of retirees even under a full employment&#13;
economic scenario. In fact, continued high rates of unemployment, increasing informalization of the&#13;
economy and the failure to adapt social insurance policies and administrative procedures to&#13;
encourage/enforce compliance in a market economy have severely aggravated the problem since 1990.&#13;
The number of contributors to the SSF has been declining steadily throughout the transition, with the&#13;
number of contributors in 1995 amounting to only 69 percent of the 1989 figure. This decline,&#13;
together with the increase in the number of pensioners in the 1991-92 period (see para. 1.15), has&#13;
meant that the number of contributors to pensioners fell from an already low ratio of 1.89 in 1989 to&#13;
about 1.16 in 1995.&#13;
1.14          Rising Payroll Tax Rates. To compensate for the drop in contributors, successive&#13;
transition governments have sought to bolster the viability of the fund by increasing payroll&#13;
contributions for remaining participants. As against a flat payroll tax rate of 28 percent in 1990,&#13;
payroll taxes on employers for social insurance are currently 37 percent for employees entitled to&#13;
normal retirement, 47 percent for those entitled to retire three years early and 52 percent on average&#13;
for those entitled to retire from 5-8 years earlyY  While these increases helped ameliorate some of&#13;
the SSF's short-term cash flow problems, there is some risk that they could exacerbate the longer-&#13;
term problem of a shrinking revenue base by raising disincentives for private employers and causing&#13;
more arrears problems on the part of many SOEs.&#13;
1.15          Low Retirement Ages. While reduced compliance has placed the SSF under financial&#13;
stress through its impact on revenues, Bulgaria's low (and mandatory) normal retirement ages (55 and&#13;
60 years for women and men respectively), policies allowing laid off workers to opt for early&#13;
retirement in the early 1990's (para. 1.5), and a dramatic expansion of the numbers of occupations&#13;
included in existing early retirement categories have placed added pressure on expenditures during the&#13;
transition. At present, as a result of successive governments' unwillingness to withstand political&#13;
pressures from occupational interest groups, nearly 30 percent of all Bulgarian workers are eligible&#13;
for early retirement. While, in theory, early retirement options are reserved for especially arduous or&#13;
dangerous occupations (e.g., miners, nuclear plant workers), in practice, a number of occupational&#13;
groups such as teachers and some drivers have sought and received early retirement privileges.&#13;
1.16          Low Value of Benefits. As previously discussed, the principal means adopted by&#13;
successive Bulgarian governments to manage pressures on expenditure has been through allowing the&#13;
real value of pension benefits to erode sharply (by nearly 55% on average between 1990 and 1995)&#13;
and at a faster rate than average wages over the past five years. Ad hoc indexing, usually with a&#13;
4' For an explanation of these early retirement categories, see para. 1.15.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
fixed sum allocated for across-the board inflation adjustments, has also meant that the distribution of&#13;
pensions has become severely compressed, so that long-service, high wage workers are not receiving&#13;
pensions which are commensurate with their contributions. This, in turn, has important disincentive&#13;
effects on voluntary payroll tax compliance, further exacerbating the SSF's fiscal difficulties.&#13;
1.17         Benefit Formula Inadequacies. Inadequate coordination of policy changes made in&#13;
the 1990-94 period and failure to adapt appropriately the rules governing benefit accrual to market&#13;
economic conditions are also causing major problems. This is especially true of efforts to increase&#13;
private sector compliance by allowing employers to base their contributions on the minimum wage for&#13;
workers employed on civil contracts (as opposed to regular labor contracts), even if actual earnings&#13;
are higher. While this measure might indeed have brought more private employers into the SSF&#13;
collections net, the short-run impact on revenues has almost certainly been outweighed by the added&#13;
burden on future expenditures, under the (unchanged) benefit formula, which is subject to&#13;
manipulation. Under the official benefit formula, pensions are tied to the best three years of earnings&#13;
out of the past 15. Consequently, the system provides an incentive for civil contract workers to make&#13;
minimum contributions until they are within three years of retirement -- at which time they can&#13;
simply make higher contributions to ensure that their pensions are higher. Similarly, given a&#13;
relatively short full contribution period of 25 years for men and 20 years for women (including time&#13;
taken for maternity and child care) and no added benefits for contributions beyond an additional six&#13;
years over and above the full contribution period, there are no incentives in a market economy to&#13;
accrue credited service for more than 31 years for men and 26 years for women. To the extent that,&#13;
based on current (very favorable) retirement ages, men who start working at age 18 have 42 years on&#13;
the job and women have 37 years (assuming maternity/child care leave is accredited), rational&#13;
workers will want to spend at least 11 years in the informal sector. Under this system, those who&#13;
play by the rules are penalized and those who do not are rewarded.&#13;
1.18         Crisis of Public Confidence. The recent trends and problems encountered in the&#13;
PAYG social insurance program (paras. 1. 13-1.17) have led to a crisis of public confidence in the&#13;
program -- initiating a vicious circle whereby people's perception of the program's weaknesses makes&#13;
them less willing to contribute to the SSF, which, in turn, weakens the program further, necessitating&#13;
undesirable actions such as further increases to payroll tax rates and/or additional erosion of the real&#13;
value of benefits in a non-transparent manner. Chief among the factors which appear to be causing&#13;
reduced confidence in the program as a reliable source of old-age income support are: (i) the&#13;
perception that pensions bear little relationship to contributions made over a lifetime of work (due to&#13;
compression); (ii) the widespread belief that the reductions in benefits are not justified by financial&#13;
exigencies but may be related to diversion of SSF collections to other public uses, including social&#13;
assistance -- a belief fueled by the well-publicized rates hikes in contributions, the dramatic decline in&#13;
the real value of pension benefits in the transition period and the incomplete separation of SSF and&#13;
general budget accounts; (iii) the view that evasion or fraud on the part of contributors/beneficiaries is&#13;
rarely punished and can lead to greater personal benefits in the immediate- and, perhaps, longer-term&#13;
than can compliance with program rules; and (iv) inadequate consultation between Government and&#13;
representatives of labor, employers, pensioners' representatives, media and other public-opinion&#13;
makers on the day-to-day operations of the social insurance program and its financial status. In this&#13;
context, it is clear that any effort to reform Bulgaria's social insurance program must overcome&#13;
current perceptions of unfairness and lack of transparency in order to be tenable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
1.19         Weaknesses in Administration. As suggested in paras. 1. 11-1.12, current&#13;
administrative procedures are ill-suited to a market economy, relying unduly on the honesty of&#13;
employers for much of the record-keeping on social insurance contributors, accurate payment of&#13;
contributions and calculation/deduction of short-term benefits and child allowances. This system was&#13;
generally workable in the pre-transition period when the numbers of employers (all state-owned) were&#13;
relatively smaller, their incentive to defraud the system was minimal, and employees tended to spend&#13;
their entire work-lives in the service of a single employer. However, it is breaking down rapidly in&#13;
today's changing econnriy characterized increasingly by profit incentives, the emergence of larger&#13;
numbers of smaller, privately-owned firms and greater labor mobility and unemployment. Indeed,&#13;
the absence, within the social insurance program, of systematic records -- in retrievable and&#13;
analyzable form -- on the contributions/claims of all participants in the system (employers,&#13;
contributors and beneficiaries) exacerbates many of the problems cited in paras. 1.13-1.18 above&#13;
and/or poses a major obstacle to their solution. Some illustrative examples follow:&#13;
*      Collections and related audit efforts are significantly weakened by the lack of computerized&#13;
monthly data on salaries, contributions and claims per employee which would enable the&#13;
routine conduct of statistical checks to identify instances of likely tax evasion/benefit abuse,&#13;
development of profiles of likely evaders, and appropriate targeting of scarce audit resources.&#13;
This, in turn, means that employers can (and do) manipulate the system to reap monetary&#13;
advantages with little fear of being identified or penalized. The downward trend in&#13;
contributions collections (even after accounting for high unemployment) accompanied by&#13;
substantial increases in claims for short-term benefits are probably mostly attributable to the&#13;
lack of control existing in the social insurance program and the changed incentives for&#13;
employers in a market economy.&#13;
-      Efforts to widen the collections net through cross-checks with tax, municipal and judicial&#13;
system records are hindered substantially by the non-availability of easily retrievable, up-to-&#13;
date records within the social insurance administration. Conversion of employer and&#13;
employee records now available only in paper form in workbooks maintained by thousands of&#13;
employers to a single computerized data base would substantially facilitate coordination with&#13;
other systems, especially if common identification numbers are used. A cooperative&#13;
framework agreement now being negotiated between the Ministry of Finance and the MOLSA&#13;
would allow for the use of common, unique identifiers (Ministry of Regional Development&#13;
EGN numbers for individuals and tax ID numbers for enterprises) and ease of coordination&#13;
between social insurance and tax authorities, provided both systems are computerized.&#13;
*      Improved services to clients (both contributors and pensioners) of the social insurance system&#13;
-- which could go a long way towards increasing public confidence in its programs - are not&#13;
feasible in the current administrative environment of scattered paper records but would be&#13;
greatly facilitated by the establishment of a central automated data base. For example,&#13;
collection of salary histories and other documentation, verification of records by regional and&#13;
then central social insurance offices, calculation of pensions and manual notification of post&#13;
offices/banks and pensioners concerning payment collection represent a considerable burden&#13;
on prospective pensioners and their employers and frequently contribute to delays in pension&#13;
receipt, imposing financial hardship on the pensioner. Moreover, there can be little doubt&#13;
that the current obligations of employers with regard to the maintenance/compilation of work,&#13;
salary and social insurance records are unduly burdensome (and getting more so as labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
mobility increases), constituting a considerable hidden tax when complied with. In relation to&#13;
contributors, the lack of records within the social insurance system implies that contributors&#13;
cannot be regularly informed of their contributions/benefit status, leaving them uncertain of&#13;
the benefits they will receive upon retirement -- and consequently less willing to contribute (or&#13;
ensure that their employers contribute on their behalf) to the system.&#13;
Proposals to close existing loopholes in the benefit formula by linking pension benefits to&#13;
contributions made over a worker's full career are not tenable under existing record-keeping&#13;
procedures, although highly desirable from a policy reform standpoint. Establishment of a&#13;
central data base containing earnings and contributions histories for every covered worker&#13;
would make possible the implementation of this crucial change to the benefit formula with&#13;
positive consequences for efforts to reduce expenditures and increase system fairness.&#13;
*     Finally, the absence of records on contributors within the social insurance system makes&#13;
accurate projection of SSF revenues and expenditures extremely difficult. This, in turn,&#13;
inhibits ongoing program evaluation, actuarial modeling and policy formulation - all crucial&#13;
functions as the market economy develops. Clearly, an up-to-date, central social insurance&#13;
information system would enable better forecasting, making realistic policy analysis a feasible&#13;
option.&#13;
D. Government Policies and Reform Proposal&#13;
1.20         The present government, given its majority in Parliament -- and hence the prospect of&#13;
relative longevity in office -- has embarked on a wide-ranging, phased reform of the social insurance&#13;
system, aimed at addressing the issues described above. The overarching objectives of the reform are&#13;
two-fold: (i) restoring the fiscal viability of the public PAYG system and adapting it to the needs of&#13;
the emerging market economy; and (ii) developing a workable and secure partnership with the private&#13;
sector in providing for old-age income security in the medium- to longer-term. The intended final&#13;
outcome of the reform is a financially sound, multi-pillar social insurance system, comprising: a&#13;
reformed, publicly-managed PAYG social insurance program providing basic coverage for about 40&#13;
percent income replacement linked strictly to (and reflecting) actual contributions; a limited number of&#13;
mandatory, but privately managed, occupational or professional funds covering inter alia some&#13;
existing early retirement categories; and voluntary, supplementary insurance provided through private&#13;
insurance companies and incentives for establishment of individual retirement accounts in banks.&#13;
Achievement of reform objectives is to be accomplished through a mix of complementary policy and&#13;
institutional reform measures incorporated in a two-phase reform process, which Government has&#13;
designed taking into account considerations of political acceptability and implementability. The&#13;
specific objectives and the modalities for implementation of each reform phase are described in the&#13;
following paragraphs.&#13;
First-Phase Reforms&#13;
1.21         The primary goal of the first reform phase, on which the Govermment is currently&#13;
embarked, is to achieve short- to medium-term fiscal balance in the SSF through concerted action on&#13;
the revenue side. An additional goal is to put in place the insitutional and administrative basis for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
more far-reaching changes in the second reform phase which will be aimed at scaling back&#13;
expenditures (and overall size) of the public PAYG system and establishing supplementary pillars as&#13;
appropriate to market economic conditions. These goals, in turn, are to be achieved by three sets of&#13;
interconnected policy and programmatic measures to: (i) introduce the notion of individual or personal&#13;
responsibility for social insurance, initially though introduction of a personal contribution to the SSF;&#13;
(ii) encourage voluntary compliance with payroll tax requirements, principally through restoring&#13;
public confidence in the system, raising incentives to comply by adjustments to the benefits formula&#13;
and leveling the playing field through closing of obvious loopholes; and (iii) improve financial&#13;
monitoring and tax enforcement through improved tracking of contributions/payments, modernization&#13;
of audit procedures and revamping of the penalty structures for delayed payments/evasion.&#13;
1.22          On a policy level, the first-phase reform measure likely to have the most direct impact&#13;
on raising SSF revenues (at least in the short-run) is legislative action to introduce a personal payroll&#13;
tax contribution to the SSF. This tax was approved by Parliament for collection as of March 1996 at&#13;
a rate of 2 percent of gross wages. Although aware of the potential long-run drawbacks inherent in a&#13;
further tax increase (see para. 1. 14), Government has argued that these are offset by (i) the immediate&#13;
boost to SSF revenues and the consequent impact on budgetary support requirements in a period of&#13;
severe pressure to contain the fiscal deficit; (ii) the introduction of the notion of personal&#13;
responsibility (however nominal) for old-age income support in that this tax increase has been levied&#13;
directly on individuals as opposed to their employers as in the past; and (iii) the opportunity that this&#13;
personal tax affords for improved tracking/monitoring of employers' contributions via routine cross-&#13;
checks of individuals' payments against the contributions made on their behalf by their employers.&#13;
1.23           With regard to encouraging voluntary compliance with SSF obligations, a key&#13;
element of Government's effort is to bolster public confidence in program management through the&#13;
creation of the separate, autonomous NSSI (para. 1.10) -- with authority to manage independently the&#13;
social insurance program and SSF under the overall supervision of Parliament and a tri-partite&#13;
Supervisory Board comprising representatives of Government (including the MOLSA and Ministry of&#13;
Finance - MOF), trade unions, employers' associations and beneficiary representatives. The&#13;
involvement of non-governmental partners in program supervision is intended to help restore public&#13;
confidence in the social insurance system by substantially increasing overall transparency and creating&#13;
a mechanism for wider consultation on program issues. Establishment of NSSI and the subsequent&#13;
separation of the SSF from the budget can also reasonably be expected to lead to greater fiscal&#13;
transparency than has as yet been possible -- especially in light of the fact that interest earned on&#13;
contributions would now be directly credited to the SSF and transfers to the SSF from the state&#13;
budget would be clearly itemized so that allocations to cover state obligations such as social assistance&#13;
payments and state employee contributions would be identified separately from any transfers to cover&#13;
SSF deficits. Within NSSI, the planned separation of the SSF into two separate funds covering long-&#13;
term and shon-term insurance respectively will further enhance fiscal transparency and program&#13;
monitoring. Finally, the legislation creating NSSI includes provision for partial capitalization of the&#13;
SSF through the transfer to NSSI of assets of former totalitarian organizations and 20 percent of the&#13;
proceeds from privatization initiatives. This asset transfer can also be expected to help signal the&#13;
population that pension promises will be met. These assets are expected to be invested in government&#13;
bonds, at least initially.&#13;
1.24          Apart from encouraging public confidence and, hence, voluntary compliance, through&#13;
improved fiscal transparency, increased stakeholder involvement and partial capitalization of the SSF,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
the Government's first reform phase includes additional measures aimed at directly strengthening&#13;
incentives for voluntary compliance. On a legislative level, two critical measures are included which&#13;
are aimed at closing loopholes that to date have allowed employers/employees to abuse the system&#13;
with impunity. First, payroll tax obligations with respect to civil contracts have been raised to the&#13;
same level as obligations with respect to labor contracts (see para. 1.17) both to enhance SSF&#13;
revenues and to provide a level playing field across individual workers and enterprises; and second,&#13;
an amendment to the existing pension law was enacted in early 1996 to lengthen the base period used&#13;
to calculate pension benefits, gradually to extend to an individual's entire contribution period. Under&#13;
the latter legislation, pension benefits will no longer be calculated on the basis of wages/contributions&#13;
in the best 36 months of a worker's career, but rather, on the best 36 months prior to 1997 plus each&#13;
month of work/contribution from January 1997 onwards5'. These measures can be expected to reduce&#13;
the currently common practice of declaring low wages and thus contributions (at least in official&#13;
documents) until a worker is within three years of retirement, with wages/contributions and hence,&#13;
eventual pension benefits, raised for the last 36 months of the worker's career. In parallel with, and&#13;
supportive of the intent of these legislative changes, steps are being taken to decompress benefit levels&#13;
by recalculating pension entitlements to better reflect actual earnings and SSF contributions. While&#13;
this latter effort will result in slightly higher pension awards for about 60 percent of pensioners,&#13;
pension levels for remaining participants are expected to stay the same or be marginally reduced. On&#13;
balance, the pension realignment effort was projected to result in some real increase in expenditure&#13;
(6% of tctal spending) in the short-rung', though on average, pensions would still remain around 45&#13;
percent below their 1990 values after implementation of the adjustment.&#13;
1.25          Concomitantly with the preceding actions to encourage directly compliance, first phase&#13;
reforms include a number of actions to better monitor and enforce compliance with SSF tax&#13;
obligations (which in turn also create an incentive for complying voluntarily). Central to this effort is&#13;
a complete overhaul of program administration (including redesign of staff functions at central and&#13;
regional NSSI offices) aimed at addressing the issues described in para. 1.19 above. The redesigned&#13;
administrative system -- the establishment of which would be supported through the project proposed&#13;
in this report -- would entail the use of information and telecommunications technology to shift the&#13;
responsibility for recording and tracking SSF contributors and contributions to NSSI and away from&#13;
employers. This shift would not only reduce the current (inappropriate) administrative burden on&#13;
employers, but would also enable NSSI to better assess and monitor the flow of funds into and out of&#13;
the SSF, cooperate with other agencies (including the MOF tax administration and municipal&#13;
authorities) in identifying and incorporating into the system the growing numbers of private employers&#13;
and the self-employed, and implement modern audit strategies based on targeted rather than scheduled&#13;
audits. To enhance the likely impact of administrative improvements, a cooperative framework&#13;
agreement is being developed between the social insurance program and the tax authorities to use&#13;
common (unique) identification numbers for individuals/firms and share information in efforts to&#13;
5' Effective implementation of this latter provision, however, is closely linked to reform of administrative processes&#13;
(para. 1. 19).&#13;
' In fact, it is unclear whether any real increase will occur as a result of this adjustment. Nominal Leva&#13;
amounts appropriated to pay for the adjustment assumed an inflation rate of 20% in 1996. Inflation is now&#13;
expected to higher, implying that an additional appropriation will be necessary if any real increases are to be&#13;
granted. Thus far, Government has not sought parliamentary approval for further appropriations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
detect/audit evaders. In addition, legislation will be developed to stiffen the consequences for SSF&#13;
contributions evasion. Regulations would also be implemented to bar banks from making short-term&#13;
loans to enterprises to meet payroll unless the enterprise is up-to-date with its SSF contributions or is&#13;
in the process of working out arrangements to clear up arrears.&#13;
1.26         A final element of first phase reform activities involves actions aimed at facilitating&#13;
changes to the benefit formula and program architecture (towards a multi-pillar approach) intended to&#13;
be implemented in the second reform phase. One key step which Government has taken in this&#13;
regard involves raising the mandatory retirement age by three years for both men and women, thereby&#13;
enabling workers to stay on the job voluntarily for a period of three years beyond the current normal&#13;
retirement (and pensionable) age. During such a voluntary extension, workers would defer collecting&#13;
accrued pensions and employers would continue to make payroll tax contributions on their behalf,&#13;
with obvious implications for SSF finances. A recent labor union poll found high support for this&#13;
voluntary retirement age increase among older workers, many of whom are likely to take the deferred&#13;
retirement/deferred pension option in the present environment where pensions are considerably below&#13;
wages. Public acceptance of this voluntary deferment of pensionable age is expected to make it easier&#13;
to implement a mandatory increase in both the pensionable and retirement ages under the second&#13;
phase of reform. Similarly, legislative action has already been taken in the first reform phase to&#13;
establish a multi-employer funded occupational insurance scheme for one major category of workers&#13;
currently eligible for early retirement. Legislation concerning the establishment of such a scheme for&#13;
teachers was approved in early 1996 and implementation is expected to begin in January 1997.&#13;
Experience with the teachers' scheme -- both political and technical -- is expected to facilitate the&#13;
introduction of similar schemes for other workers' groups entitled to early retirement under current&#13;
regulations.&#13;
Second-Phase Reforms&#13;
1.27         The second reform phase, to be implemented in the latter half of 1996 and during&#13;
1997, would be aimed at: (i) operationalizing the three-pillar social insurance system by putting in&#13;
place the regulatory framework (including tax incentives) for the privately-managed mandatory and&#13;
voluntary supplemental insurance schemes (para. 1.20); and (ii) revision of benefit eligibility criteria&#13;
and the formula for calculation of benefit levels to directly reduce PAYG social insurance program&#13;
expenditures. Details of the second phase reforms are still being refined and are expected to be&#13;
presented for parliamentary discussion/approval in the latter part of 1996. However, the basic&#13;
directions have largely been set and are expected to incorporate the following: (i) making retirement&#13;
conditions made stricter by raising the average retirement age; (ii) lengthening of work requirements&#13;
to gain eligibility for a full pension to better reflect individuals' actual work-lives; (iii) removing the&#13;
minimum pension requirement but retaining a maximum benefit level; (iv) reduction of accrual rates;&#13;
(v) removal of most early retirement categories from the publicly-managed PAYG system, to be&#13;
replaced by multi-employer funded occupational schemes, eventually to be operated on a defined&#13;
contribution basis; (vi) development of the regulatory framework and incentive schemes for the&#13;
establishment of supplementary voluntary funded pension schemes; and (vii) requirement of employers&#13;
to cover costs of sick leave for four days per sickness episode, up to a maximum of 14 days annually,&#13;
before receiving benefits from the social insurance fund.&#13;
1.28         Clearly, policy reforms included in the second phase would have a strong impact on&#13;
the PAYG program's expenditures. The reforms are likely to lead to sufficient SSF surpluses which,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
when combined with privatization revenues (see para. 1.23), would enable the partial capitalization of&#13;
the fund (Government intends to build up a three-month reserve) and still bring about gradual&#13;
reductions in payroll taxes and/or increases in benefit generosity. The most direct effect on&#13;
expenditures would derive from raising of normal retirement ages and the transfer of early retirement&#13;
categories from the PAYG system to privately-managed funded schemes, similar to that being&#13;
established for teachers in the first phase. The transfer of the early retirement categories would be&#13;
accompanied by reductions in the payroll tax obligations to the SSF of their employers, thus lowering&#13;
average payroll tax levies and reducing the overall size of the PAYG program. The system's fiscal&#13;
integrity would be further strengthened by the proposed changes in the benefit formula given the strict&#13;
links to be established between pensions and contributory years/lifetime earnings. Since workers&#13;
could no longer "game" the system to receive higher benefits, they would be more likely to ensure&#13;
that lifetime contributions would be made in their behalf. While the credibility of the fund will&#13;
primarily be established in the first phase of the reform, the process will be strengthened in the&#13;
second phase. For example, the strong linkage between contributions and benefits would strengthen&#13;
the perception that funds could not be diverted towards other uses. In addition, the proposed reforms&#13;
to the system of short-term benefits will help ensure greater vigilance on the part of employers to&#13;
prevent abuse.&#13;
Expected Impact&#13;
1.29         Evaluation of the financial impact of the social insurance reform program by means of&#13;
a Bulgaria-specific actuarial model (constructed with support from the Japanese Grant provided for&#13;
project preparation) indicates that, if implemented as currently conceived, the reform would be&#13;
successful in achieving its stated objectives as described in para. 1.20. Simulations from the actuarial&#13;
model indicate that first-phase policy measures alone -- i.e., introduction of the 2 percent individual&#13;
tax and lifting of the mandatory retirement age by three years (paras. 1.22 and 1.26 respectively) --&#13;
would eliminate the need for budgetary financing of the SSF, if compliance remains at present levels.&#13;
Improvements in compliance as a result of modernization of program administration and improved&#13;
public confidence in the PAYG system would compound this favorable impact, allowing NSSI to&#13;
build up a three-month reserve to insure against short-term fiscal distress and still leave some&#13;
surpluses in the SSF -- beginning to create room for reductions in payroll tax in the future.&#13;
Implementation of second-phase reforms would substantially reduce SSF expenditures, further&#13;
increasing fund surpluses. In fact, raising of the normal retirement age alone (by three years for both&#13;
men and women, phased in over 6 years) would imply that the PAYG system payroll tax could&#13;
conservatively be reduced by 9 percent over the projection period (1996-2019), while continuing to&#13;
maintain a fund ratio equal to 25 percent of expenditures as a cushion against fiscal uncertainty. The&#13;
financial impact of the other second-phase policy reforms has not yet been simulated, but it can be&#13;
expected to further strengthen this favorable impact on fund balances, in turn allowing further&#13;
reductions in employer payroll tax rates. These reductions in the payroll tax, if implemented by&#13;
Government, would not only reduce labor costs with positive implications for employment but also&#13;
create a more favorable environment for the growth of privately-managed funded pension schemes&#13;
with their attendant implications for savings and, hence, long-term economic growth. Further details&#13;
concerning the actuarial simulations and their results are given in Annex 2.&#13;
1.30         In conclusion, however, it should be noted that although Government's current reform&#13;
proposals can provide the foundation for a mixed system of social insurance which is consistent with&#13;
long-term economic growth and the development of a market economy, as discussed above, there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
remain important gaps in the definition of the second-phase reform actions and objectives which could&#13;
reduce the reform's positive impact. Most noteworthy in this regard is the absence to date of a&#13;
formal commitment to a specific target for benefits in terms of a maximum wage replacement rate&#13;
(e.g., 40% of wages), implying that continuous increases in benefit generosity could absorb projected&#13;
SSF surpluses, reducing or eliminating the opportunities for reductions in payroll tax rates. This, in&#13;
turn, would negate some of the potential benefits of the reform for the economy as a whole, by&#13;
maintaining high labor costs and slowing down the development of funded schemes. At this stage,&#13;
there is every indication that Government is considering these issues carefully (with appropriate&#13;
technical support from external donors, including the Bank), increasing the likelihood of favorable&#13;
decisions with regard to benefits and tax levels. Moreover, there can be little doubt that the reforms&#13;
already included in the first phase will contribute significantly to maintenance of fiscal stability by&#13;
eliminating pressures for budgetary subsidies for pension expenditures.&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.1           The overall goal of the proposed project is to support and sustain the Government's&#13;
social insurance reform program as described in the preceding Chapter and outlined in its Letter of&#13;
Sectoral Development Policy (LSDP)(Annex 3). During negotiations, assurances were provided that&#13;
the Government will iinplement the strategy contained in its ISDP. Specifically, the project aims to&#13;
support Government's current reform goals of eliminating the budgetary subsidy for social insurance&#13;
through the achievement of fiscal balance in the SSF and laying the groundwork for future reforms&#13;
aimed at more fundamental restructuring of Bulgaria's system for guaranteeing old age income&#13;
security. Therefore, the project will:&#13;
(a)    strengthen efforts to increase NSSI's overall operational efficiency in today's&#13;
emerging market economy, with a focus on reversing the trend towards reduced tax&#13;
compliance which is undermining the financial stability of the public PAYG social&#13;
insurance program; and&#13;
(b)    strengthen the institutional capacity of the newly-created NSSI to perform key policy&#13;
formulation and evaluation functions and better manage available resources.&#13;
2.2           Linked to the above objectives, the project has two main components: Increasing&#13;
Compliance and Operational Efficiency and Strengthening Institutional Capacity, and will be&#13;
implemented over a period of four years. A detailed description of these components is given below&#13;
in Section B, followed in Section C by the economic justification for the project. The Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (PIP) is given in Annex 5 and summarized in Chapter 3 of the main text of this&#13;
report.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
Component 1: Increasing Compliance and Operational Efficiency (US$25.8 million base cost)&#13;
2.3           Overview. Aimed at supporting the achievement of fiscal balance in the SSF through&#13;
improved compliance, this component of the project will restructure substantially NSSI's operations&#13;
with a view to: (i) the development and implementation of modern payroll tax collection and audit&#13;
strategies; (ii) improved services to program clients, both contributors and beneficiaries; and (iii)&#13;
improved revenue/expenditure monitoring and projection capability. A fundamental tool in the&#13;
achievement of progress in each of these areas will be the establishment/maintenance within NSSI of a&#13;
centralized data base or register containing information (in readily retrievable form) on employers,&#13;
self-employed, employees and pensioners concerning key biographical information, wages&#13;
paid/earned, contributions paid and benefits received. The central register will be developed within a&#13;
flexible software environment with capability for addition of specialized software applications to&#13;
support operational improvements. In addition to the design/implementation of the central register&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
with its attendant hardware, software and technical expertise requirements, achievement of the three&#13;
identified programmatic priorities will involve substantial foreign and local consultant services and&#13;
training/retraining of about two/thirds of NSSI's 2,500 personnel to restructure and streamline&#13;
business processes at NSSI's headquarters in Sofia and at its 28 regional offices (see Map, IBRD&#13;
No. 26532, for office locations). Details concerning project activities in relation to the three&#13;
programmatic objectives listed above are given below.&#13;
2.4           Social Insurance Information System (SIIS). As suggested in the preceding&#13;
paragraph, the transfer of information from scattered paper records (now maintained by thousands of&#13;
employers and in employee workbooks -- see paras. 1.12 and 1.19) into a single, computerized data-&#13;
base within NSSI is a basic building block for launching the efficiency improvements in tax&#13;
collection, client services and financial monitoring discussed above. Therefore, the project will&#13;
support development of an integrated SIIS, the first step in the creation of which would be the&#13;
establishment of a central re2ister containing pertinent information on all social insurance system&#13;
clients, using unique identifying numbers for each individual or firm. To avoid unnecessary&#13;
duplication and facilitate future cooperation with other agencies, the ID numbers used for social&#13;
insurance purposes will be the EGN (internal ID number issued at birth by the Ministry of Regional&#13;
Development) for individuals and the Ministry of Finance tax number for firms. Prior to loan&#13;
negotiations, Government confirmed to the Bank its decision to use EGN numbers and Tax ID&#13;
numbers as the unique identifiers for individuals and firms respectively.&#13;
2.5            In line with recent legislation enacted by parliament to extend the base for pensions&#13;
(para. 1.24), initial start-up of the central register will involve the collection from employers/self-&#13;
employed of wage and contribution information for each worker for up to 36 months in the period&#13;
prior to January 1997 and for each month thereafter. Development of reporting procedures&#13;
(electronic, for larger firms and handwritten for very small ones), design of software applications, and&#13;
training and limited purchase of computer hardware for this substantial initial data collection/entry&#13;
effort are already underway with assistance from the Technical Assistance Loan (No. 3384-BU).&#13;
Based on this advice, Government confirmed at negotiations that, prior to loan effectiveness,&#13;
regulations will be issued to employers/self-employed to provide NSSI with relevant biographical&#13;
anid historical and monthly wage and contributions data per employed person (using the EGN and&#13;
Tax ID numbers as identifiers) in a form suitable for central register development. Inputs under&#13;
this project will, therefore, focus on the national implementation of the initial data collection effort&#13;
and the design/implementation of ongoing reporting requirements to ensure that the register remains&#13;
current. Although the detailed design of the operation and management of the central register (and&#13;
related functional responsibilities at regional and central level) will be developed following&#13;
recruitment of specialized expertise under the project, it is expected that data entry and updates will&#13;
occur at the regional level for the relevant geographic area, with data forwarded to the center on a&#13;
regular (e.g., daily) basis. The center, in turn, will maintain the complete register, define and&#13;
manage system administration, including setting standards for privacy and security safeguards, and&#13;
have primary responsibility for ensuring consistency and quality of information across regions. Each&#13;
region will maintain only a subset of the central register data-base, relevant to clients in its&#13;
geographical coverage area.&#13;
2.6           Beyond establishing the central register, SIIS development will involve the design and&#13;
implementation of a number of functional software applications (Table 2.1) which will allow for use&#13;

of central register and other pertinent information to support operational improvements in the areas&#13;
of: (i) contributions collections and short-term benefits management; (ii) audit; (iii) pension&#13;
management; and (iv) customer service. Development of these applications would be closely&#13;
coordinated with, and complement, the design/implementation of strategic and operational&#13;
improvements in NSSI business procedures (the main emphases of which are described in para. 2.9).&#13;
Apart from these externally or client-oriented applications and applications for central register&#13;
maintenance, three additional software applications would be developed to improve the internal&#13;
efficiency of NSSI operations -- including applications for internal NSSI financial management&#13;
(budget control, payroll etc.), human resources or personnel management and SIIS administration. It&#13;
should be noted that for cost reasons, suitable software packages for functional applications will be&#13;
purchased off-the-shelf whenever feasible, and adapted to local needs. Development of software&#13;
applications from scratch (generally a more costly alternative) will only be undertaken when no&#13;
suitable sceftware package is commercially available.&#13;
2.7          In terms of hardware architecture for the SIIS, the design option to be supported&#13;
through the project involves adoption of a uniform UNIX-based, open commodity-type system at both&#13;
central and regional levels, the basic specifications for which are included in the PIP (Annex 5). The&#13;
proposed UNIX system archtitecture will enable the maintenance of regional data-base subsets&#13;
necessary for performance of routine regional functions such as data collection, compliance checks&#13;
and customer service. It will also allow for the regular transfer of data from each region to the&#13;
center, which will, as previously noted, maintain the entire central register and use specialized&#13;
applications for national program monitoring. finally, the proposed UNIX based architecture will be&#13;
flexible and expandable. As such, it will be able to accommodate information for additional social&#13;
insurance funds, such as the unemployment fund or a prospective health fund, when and if these&#13;
programs are incorporated into NSSI as per current plans. The decision to use the UNIX-based&#13;
technology was predicated inter alia on: (i) the growing trend in information technology towards&#13;
open systems based on UNIX rather than proprietary mainframes, implying in turn greater availability&#13;
of standard software packages for UNIX and a larger number of hardware and software suppliers;&#13;
(ii) the need to minimize recurrent telecommunications costs which are extremely high in Bulgaria&#13;
compared to many othei Eastern European countries; and (iii) the larger number of Bulgarians with&#13;
training ill UNIX-based versus mainframe-based systems. Apropos of telecommunications costs, it&#13;
should be noted that although the SIIS would be designed in a manner enabling a complete transfer to&#13;
an on-line basis if and when telecommunications costs in Bulgaria are more comparable to costs&#13;
elsewhere, it is currently anticipated that on-line functions will be kept to a minimum in the short- to&#13;
medium-term so that only updates will be transferred to the center during the day with bulk transfers&#13;
to be done at night when reduced rates are attainable.&#13;
2.8           For the establishment and development of the SIIS, the project will finance&#13;
equipment, civil works, technical support, and staff training. Hardware and systems software for&#13;
both central and regional offices will be provided, as well as a modern voice and data&#13;
communications system and a security and access control system. The project will provide financing&#13;
for a full-time management oversight team of technical experts (80 months). The team will be&#13;
composed of a social security management specialist and an information technology specialist (who&#13;
will also be responsible for quality assurance). In addition, technical expertise (54 months) in&#13;
establishment of the central register and design and implementation of functional software applications&#13;
will be financed under the project. During negotiations NSSI confirmed that a full-time counterpart&#13;
NSSI team of technical informatics staff of at least four professional staff with experience&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition of effectiveness. In addition, assurances were obtained&#13;
at loan negotiatons that the counterpart team will be maintained and fully allocated to the project&#13;
throughout project implementation. Training of NSSI staff in the use of equipment and software will&#13;
also be provided; it is estimated that approximately 65 percent of the staff will receive training in use&#13;
of the new hardware and software applications. Funds are provided for minor civil works to upgrade&#13;
the NSSI Headquarters building in Sofia and the 28 regional offices to accommodate the new&#13;
computer equipment coming in under the project. Finally, 10 vehicles - one for each of the regional&#13;
offices and Headquarters - will be provided to support communications linkages between offices.&#13;
2.9           Reform of Key Business Processes. As indicated above, the redesign of business&#13;
processes related to contributions collections, financial management, audit and customer services is of&#13;
central importance to the achievement of improvements in compliance and will be supported under the&#13;
project through the provision of specialized expertise and subsequent staff training. Project-financed&#13;
foreign and local experts will work under "twinning" arrangements with experienced NSSI staff to&#13;
ensure that proposed reforms are not only fully appropriate to the Bulgarian context but also are&#13;
backed up by practical procedures, guidelines, handbooks and other materials so that they can be&#13;
implemented in a predictable, monitorable and reasonably uniform manner. It should also be noted&#13;
that the redesign of business processes will be iterative with the establishment of the SIIS, given the&#13;
strong interdependence between the expected changes in business processes and the use of information&#13;
and telecommunications technologies to implement them. The key areas targeted for project support&#13;
are described below.&#13;
Payroll Tax Collection and Revenue/Expenditure Monitoring. As suggested in para. 1.19,&#13;
NSSI currently has only very limited ability to identify or verify the payroll tax obligations of&#13;
employers who, to date, self-assess obligations and pay taxes (with attendant forms) directly&#13;
to NSSI accounts in designated banks, without any accounting to NSSI. Moreover, periodic&#13;
statements provided by the banks to NSSI do not include information concerning deposited&#13;
amounts by depositor, making it difficult to check accuracy of payments even when payroll&#13;
tax obligations are known (e.g., in the case of some large firms). The first of these problems&#13;
will be largely ameliorated following the issuance of instructions to employers for monthly&#13;
reporting of wages/contributions in the context of central register development (para. 2.5).&#13;
To rectify the second problem, prior to loan negotiations, the Government formalized an&#13;
agreement with the bank handling the majority of NSSI accounts that individual deposits&#13;
would be separately identified in statements provided to NSSI, with depositors identified by&#13;
their name and tax ID number. At negotiations, assurances were provided that similar&#13;
agreements would be formalized with all other banks handling NSSI accounts now or in the&#13;
future. In the context of these regulatory changes, project support for monitoring/control of&#13;
payroll tax collections will focus on: (i) assisting NSSI to develop and implement procedures&#13;
(aided by SIIS software applications) for routine reconciliation of employer- and bank-&#13;
provided information to identify problems; (ii) developing reporting mechanisms and&#13;
procedures for scrutinizing short-term benefits deducted from tax contributions to minimize&#13;
manipulation by employers; (iii) reviewing filing procedures and periodicity of filing,&#13;
especially the now-burdensome requirements for self-employed entrepreneurs, with a view to&#13;
simplifying procedures and, hence, encouraging voluntary compliance; and (iv) providing&#13;
practical, hands-on training to regional and selected central office staff in the implementation&#13;
of suggested improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Following substantial establishment of these procedures (including the development/&#13;
implementation of supporting SIIS applications) and the improved monitoring/enforcement&#13;
capacity which they imply, Government intends to take further actions to curtail manipulation&#13;
of payroll tax payments via misreporting or fraud in the area of short-term benefits. In this&#13;
regard, assurances were provided during negotiations that Government would, by December&#13;
31, 1998: (i) reduce incentives for employers to claim unwarranted sick leave by making&#13;
them responsible for benefits for the first 4 days per sickness episode, up to a maximwn of&#13;
15 days per employee per year; (ii) require calculation of the average wage base for sick&#13;
and maternity leave benefits over a 12-month period; and (iii) amend the labor code so that&#13;
the payment of sick and maternity leave benefits is contingent upon payment of full payroll&#13;
tax contributions on behalf of the employee. This latter provision, coupled with the recently-&#13;
enacted extension of the pension base to cover every month of contributions from January&#13;
1997 onwards, can be expected to increase incentives for employees to ensure that full&#13;
contributions are made on their behalf.&#13;
Audit. Complementary to, and supportive of, efforts to improve routine tax collection&#13;
procedures, the project will provide technical expertise, equipment (mainly lap-top computers&#13;
for auditors and related software) and intensive staff training to reorient the audit process&#13;
from a system of scheduled audits to one of computer-assisted targeted audits, appropriate to a&#13;
market economy. Project inputs will aim at a complete overhaul of pre-audit, audit, and post-&#13;
audit procedures as follows:&#13;
(i)   Institution of Pre-audit Activities. Development of pre-audit strategies and procedures&#13;
will focus on the design and implementation of a system to obtain, and use for&#13;
targeting purposes, the profiles of employers (both large and small) most likely to&#13;
evade social insurance contributions, fully or in part. These profiles of potential non-&#13;
compliers (and potential sources of evasion) will be computer-generated via&#13;
specialized SIIS applications, building on information available within NSSI's SIIS as&#13;
a result of changes to employer and bank reporting procedures and through design and&#13;
institution of a system of cross-checks with other agencies' information, especially that&#13;
of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Administration offices at central and lower levels.&#13;
To help ensure an appropriate climate for the requisite inter-agency cooperation, prior&#13;
to loan negotiations, Government finalized a cooperative framework agreement&#13;
between the MOF and NSSI confirming both instiutions' intent to cooperate in the&#13;
area of tax enforcement.&#13;
(ii)    Development of new Auditing Strategies/Procedures. Project-supported changes to the&#13;
audit phase will involve a move away from the sole use of full physical audits of&#13;
enterprises to the adoption of a broader menu of audit techniques ranging from simple&#13;
telephone or mail inquiries for clarification of minor filing errors to complex audits&#13;
involving collection of all relevant financial information through on-site visits to&#13;
companies and incorporating computer-assisted personal interview procedures.&#13;
Project inputs will not only help design and train auditors to implement this wider&#13;
range of audit procedures but also assist in the development of criteria for use of the&#13;
different audit techniques and help develop materials (including software applications)&#13;
necessary to bolster audit performance. In addition, a review will be conducted of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
the laws and regulations governing disclosure of information by employers and&#13;
recommendations made for improvements as warranted.&#13;
(iii)   Reorientation of Post-Audit Strategies. Project assistance in the area of post-audit&#13;
activities will be oriented mainly towards increasing their potential for encouraging&#13;
voluntary compliance and greater speed in the clearance of arrears, rather than&#13;
focusing purely on punishment of evaders. Inter alia, a main focus of project support&#13;
will be the review of (and implementation of necessary changes to) strategies for&#13;
collection of arrears, the workings of the appeals process and the impact of recent&#13;
legislative changes to stiffen penalties for evaders (para. 1.24). In this context,&#13;
Government ensured that the conduct of a review of the penalty structure for non-&#13;
compliance or arrears would be completed no later than December 31, 1999, and&#13;
that modification of the penalty structure in accordance with the findings of the&#13;
review would be legislated no later than March 30, 2000.&#13;
*      ( ustomer Service. The final area of NSSI business process innovation involving intensive&#13;
project inputs relates to improving services for social insurance clients. These service&#13;
improvements will be aimed at encouraging voluntary compliance through: (i) lowering costs&#13;
to clients (both contributors and beneficiaries) of participating in the system; and&#13;
(ii) bolstering policy and institutional measures to increase public confidence in the viability of&#13;
the SSF through complementary service improvements. A key additional goal will be to&#13;
curtail the recent (costly) trend towards establishing multiple sub-offices linked to NSSI&#13;
regional offices in an effort to better reach the growing NSSI client base.2' In this context,&#13;
project support in the area of customer service will, in the first instance, focus on the&#13;
development and implementation of strategies for new operating procedures to reduce the need&#13;
for face-to-face contacts between NSSI and its clients. In large measure, this will involve&#13;
development of the capability of NSSI's customer service personnel to handle efficiently all&#13;
routine and a substantial proportion of complex customer enquiries by mail, fax and telephone&#13;
(upgraded capabilities for telephone and facsimile machines would be provided through the&#13;
project), supported by access to computerized contributor and beneficiary records via special&#13;
applications of the SIIS. Secondlv, the project will assist NSSI to design, and generate&#13;
automatically via the SIIS, periodic statements concerning the contribution and/or benefit&#13;
status of each social insurance client which would be forwarded by mail on at least an annual&#13;
basis. Finally, technical advice will be provided through the project to ensure that the full&#13;
benefits to clients of the establishment of the SIIS are realized. Inter alia, this will involve&#13;
changes to existing practices to: (i) eliminate the present burden on employers/retirees to&#13;
collect and submit wage and contributions histories at the point of retirement and develop the&#13;
requisite application to generate the information directly from the SIIS; (ii) increase the&#13;
timeliness and accuracy of pension payments through the automatic generation by the SIIS of&#13;
payment instructions to banks and post offices in place of manually-prepared lists; and (iii) as&#13;
banking conditions permit, replace the current cumbersome system of cash payments of&#13;
pensions with check or direct deposit payments issued automatically by the SIIS.&#13;
7' The growth in the client base results from the emergence of thousands of new private micro-, small-, and&#13;
medium-enterprises since the start of the transition as well as larger numbers of beneficiaries following generous&#13;
early retirement provisions in the 1991-92 period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
2.10          To improve communications linkages with the NSSI office network, the project will&#13;
finance investments to improve electronic communications between Headquarters and the 28 regional&#13;
offices. This will include rewiring of the NSSI buildings and installation of Private Branch&#13;
Exchanges (PBEs) and telephone sets. Technical assistance (16 months) will focus on developing&#13;
system design and specifications, and oversight of the new system. In addition, a security and access&#13;
control system will be introduced to improve the security of the information system. Under the&#13;
project, three months of technical assistance will be provided to develop a security policy and&#13;
administrative procedures, and necessary equipment and accessories will be provided for&#13;
establishment of a Central Security Unit and Regional Security Units.&#13;
2.11          For reform of key business processes, the project will finance eight months of&#13;
technical expertise for collections, compliance and audit functions. The project will also provide&#13;
financing for both foreign and local technical assistance in the amount of 60 months for re-&#13;
engineering of business processes and related software customization in the areas of contributions and&#13;
short-term benefits, pensions, audit, customer services, and financial management. The project will&#13;
finance requisite software packages, and related training and continuing education courses to enhance&#13;
the skills of NSSI personnel working in both headquarters and the regional offices. It is estimated&#13;
that about 60 percent of the training of NSSI staff will be done by local consultants. Periodic&#13;
seminars and/or workshops for information and exchange of experience will also be organized.&#13;
Component 2: Strengthening Institutional Capacity (US$2.8 million base cost)&#13;
2.12          Overview. The second, and smaller, component of the proposed project is designed&#13;
to support the functioning of the newly-created NSSI and especially, to add institutional capacity to&#13;
conduct functions that were previously less important, including policy analysis, actuarial forecasting,&#13;
public information/education concerning the social insurance program and personnel management&#13;
(including staff development). As the economy moves towards a more flexible labor market with&#13;
increasing private-sector employment, the social insurance system will need an expanded and&#13;
modernized capacity to analyze program performance, initiate and institute changes in policy, and&#13;
publicize program initiatives. It will also need to establish a human resource department for the&#13;
Institute to increase the effectiveness of the staff, through improvements in staff selection, incentives,&#13;
and training and career development. The recent separation of NSSI from the MOLSA creates a&#13;
unique opportunity to implement such changes. Consequently, this component will establish within&#13;
NSSI the capacity to carry out the following four functions more effectively: (i) actuarial analysis;&#13;
(ii) program evaluation and policy development; (iii) public affairs; and (iv) human resource&#13;
development (personnel management). An organizational structure for NSSI incorporating these&#13;
functions was finalized prior to project negotiations. In addition, NSSI will, prior to loan&#13;
effectiveness, appoint at least three professional staff to each of the policy analysis, actuarial&#13;
forecasting, human resources, and public affairs units to be supported through the project.&#13;
Moreover, during negotiations, assurances were provided that the annual workplans of the first&#13;
three units would be submitted to the Bank for review and technical comment prior to the start of&#13;
each calendar year within the project implementation period. Project subcomponents in each of&#13;
these areas (and their rationale) are described in paras. 2.13-2.16 below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
2.13          Statistics and Actuarial Analysis. At the present time, the Analysis and Prognosis&#13;
Department of the NSSI projects fund revenues and expenditures for social insurance programs one&#13;
year into the future. With the development of a market economy, longer-run projections are needed&#13;
to ensure that current and future policies support the financial viability of the social insurance system.&#13;
Ongoing Bulgarian efforts to develop this capacity have included a number of preparatory activities,&#13;
including model development and training, with support from the Japanese Grant for project&#13;
preparation activities. However, the full establishment of an ongoing actuarial office has not yet been&#13;
completed. Consequently, the project will assist the Government in establishing the capacity to&#13;
conduct actuarial analysis within a flexible framework. As a result, NSSI will have access to&#13;
(i) short-term and long-term projections of program revenues and expenditures under the current&#13;
social insurance system; (ii) short-term and long-term simulations of revenues and expenditures under&#13;
different economic and demographic assumptions; and (iii) short-term and long-term simulations of&#13;
revenues and expenditures under proposals for reform. Under the project, eight months of technical&#13;
assistance, training and office equipment will be provided to establish a statistics and actuarial office&#13;
to satisfy data requirements and to provide a training program in actuarial practices and the use of&#13;
actuaries in government.&#13;
2.14          Policy Evaluation and Analysis. The NSSI will need a policy evaluation and&#13;
analysis capacity that is broader in scope than that provided through actuarial analysis to ensure that&#13;
the social insurance system remains on a sound financial footing and provides equitable benefits to&#13;
recipients consistent with program objectives. The separation of the NSSI from the MOLSA&#13;
accentuates the need for a separate policy office to evaluate current and proposed policy changes and&#13;
recommend program alternatives to policy-makers. The project will assist the NSSI to develop an&#13;
ongoing capacity to provide policy makers with (i) analyses of the welfare and demographic impacts&#13;
of current programs and program changes; (ii) analyses of the impact of program changes within the&#13;
broader context of the economy; (iii) analyses of the legal implications of the proposed policy&#13;
changes; and (iv) analyses of the capacity of the system to absorb these changes. Under the project,&#13;
10 months of technical assistance, training and office equipment will be provided to establish a policy&#13;
unit within NSSI and to develop a plan for the production of studies and reports. The project will&#13;
also provide two months of technical assistance to help establish data sources and develop a training&#13;
program on the use of policy analysis in government-sponsored social insurance programs.&#13;
2.15          Public Affairs. Currently, public affairs activities are only performed sporadically&#13;
and in a reactive rather than pro-active fashion. With the establishment of NSSI as an autonomous&#13;
institute and the upcoming policy reform program, it is increasingly important that the policy reforms&#13;
be introduced in a positive environment, and that the public receive educational and informational&#13;
materials about the social insurance program. Thus the project will support the establishment of a&#13;
public affairs unit within the NSSI. The public affairs office will provide: (i) a source of ongoing&#13;
contact and outreach to the media; and (ii) direct information to fund contributors and beneficiaries.&#13;
Under the project, four months of technical assistance will be provided for the development of the&#13;
office's mission statement, procedures and activities. In addition, a training program will be&#13;
developed for the public affairs staff and NSSI managers who are the public representatives of the&#13;
social insurance system. The project will also provide support in the form of office and a limited&#13;
amount of audio-visual equipment for the new unit as well as financing for the costs of designing and&#13;
implementing three public information campaigns related to policy innovations and changing operating&#13;
practices of the social insurance program as they affect system clients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
2.16         Human Resource Development. The NSSI presently has a staff of some 2,630&#13;
people, including the regional offices. The newly established Human Resources office, consisting of&#13;
only two staff, handles all personnel administration functions. Resource management capacity is non-&#13;
existent - job classification and descriptions have not been developed, and there is no training and&#13;
career development strategy. Now that the NSSI is autonomous, a modem and efficient human&#13;
resource management capacity needs to be developed. The project will support the development of&#13;
this human resource function at NSSI. Specifically, 16 months of technical assistance and&#13;
management training for office personnel and office equipment will be provided for each of three&#13;
units as follows: (i) recruitment and placement; (ii) compensations and benefits; and (iii) training and&#13;
career development. The Recruitment and Placement Unit will be responsible for personnel planning,&#13;
job classifications and descriptions, evaluation and promotion, as well as personnel administration.&#13;
'T'he Compensations and Benefits Unit will be responsible for negotiations of contracts, salaries and&#13;
benefits packages, and monitoring of occupational safety compliance. The Training and Career&#13;
Development Unit will be responsible for preparation and management of the staff training program,&#13;
preparation of a career development strategy, and establishment of a career development information&#13;
service. Two months of technical assistance will also be provided to carry out a study of best options&#13;
for management of the assets for which the NSSI is now responsible. Funds are also planned for a&#13;
minibus to provide transport for staff involved in training activities. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were provided that training and staff development plans covering the upcoming 12-month period&#13;
will be submitted to the Bank for review and comment no later than the end of each calendar year&#13;
throughout the project implementation period.&#13;
2.17         Project Coordination. For the project to be implemented smoothly and efficiently,&#13;
the project activities have to be coordinated and monitored effectively, communications and linkages&#13;
between implementing institutions maintained, and resources made available to implementing units in&#13;
a timely and effective manner. For this purpose, a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has been&#13;
established, reporting directly to the Office of the Governor of NSSI. The PCU consists of full-time&#13;
qualified staff headed by a Project Coordinator, and supported by a project-financed core team&#13;
comprised of: (i) a project manager; (ii) a procurement officer; (iii) an accountant; and (iv) an&#13;
administrative assistant. The responsibilities, staff functions and resource requirements of the PCU&#13;
are further described in Chapter 3 and the PIP, Annex 5. The project will finance 5 months of&#13;
technical assistance for management support, workstations and other office equipment for the unit,&#13;
one vehicle to support PCU activities, and staff training in various aspects of project management.&#13;
Funds have also been included for annual audit services. To ensure prompt start-up of project&#13;
activities, NSSI, prior to loan negotiations, recruited and appointed staff to all PCU positions.&#13;
During negotiations, NSSI confirmed that the PCU will be maintained throughout the project&#13;
implementation period with staffing, functions and authorities acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
C. Project Justification&#13;
.18          Overview. The development of an affordable social insurance strategy is essential to&#13;
macroeconomic stability as social insurance expenditures frequently represent a drain on the budget&#13;
through the need for budgetary subsidies. Further, if these expenditures are financed through&#13;
excessively high payroll tax rates, either employment will fall or non-compliance will increase,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
threatening the stability of a country's entire tax base. Until recently, the social insurance program in&#13;
Bulgaria threatened macroeconomic stability by requiring substantial budgetary inflows, even as&#13;
payroll-tax rate increases were enacted. During this period, roughly covering the years 1989-1994,&#13;
discussions between the Bank and Government were generally unsuccessful, with little or no&#13;
agreement reached among the parties. Since that time, as Government has started to take steps to&#13;
rationalize the system, more fruitful dialogue has taken place. The proposed Social Insurance&#13;
Administration Project is a cost-effective strategy in its own right and is necessary for the successful&#13;
implementation of structural pension reform. Further, it can be an effective instrument for a&#13;
continuing policy dialogue.&#13;
2.19          As such, the project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),&#13;
presented to the Board in April 1996, and in particular, with the triggers it establishes for social&#13;
sector involvement by the Bank. It addresses serious issues of compliance and fiscal sustainability&#13;
which were identified through economic and sector work conducted prior to, and during, project&#13;
preparation. In supporting the redesign and modernization of fundamental social insurance business&#13;
and administrative processes, the project reaps significantly positive fiscal dividends, although the&#13;
policy framework remains incomplete. The project mix, combining fiscal savings with the&#13;
strengthening of institutional capacity, particularly in the area of policy analysis, results in savings&#13;
that are far greater than the cost of the loan on a present value basis even under conservative&#13;
assumptions. These issues are elaborated further in the economic analysis presented in the remainder&#13;
of this section, which covers the following topics: (a) linkages to the CAS; (b) linkages to economic&#13;
and sector work; (c) public/private sector justification; (d) the adequacy of the policy environment;&#13;
(e) an analysis of project alternatives; (f) cost recovery and fiscal impact; (g) institutional capacity and&#13;

2.20          Linkages to the CAS. The Bank's core lending program for Bulgaria, described in&#13;
the April 1996 CAS, includes the Social Insurance Administration Project, given the project's&#13;
expected positive long-term effect on overall economic performance and its relative insulation from&#13;
short- to medium-term macroeconomic instability should it arise (see para. 1.2). Indeed, the&#13;
proposed project is fully supportive of the low-case country assistance strategy by assisting in the&#13;
establishment of institutional capacity which would help Government to bolster the financial solvency&#13;
of the SSF, improve service delivery to clients and conduct the necessary actuarial and policy analysis&#13;
to underpin future (more fundamental) structural reform. As a result, the project will contribute to&#13;
the country's transition to a market economy by directly improving government finances, and in the&#13;
longer-run, potentially encouraging economic growth through lower taxes and the development of&#13;
funded pension plans.&#13;
2.21          It should also be noted that Government's broader initiatives in the area of social&#13;
insurance reform -- which form the context for the proposed project -- conform closely to the two-&#13;
stage program anticipated in the CAS. Government has been moving forward on schedule with the&#13;
first reform phase outlined in the CAS, having already taken actions to: (a) separate fund finances&#13;
from the budget, and, in so doing, strengthen tripartite relationships, institute partial fund&#13;
capitalization, and legislate measures to improve tax compliance (including lengthening the&#13;
wage/contributions base for pension calculation to extend gradually to cover an individual's entire&#13;
worklng career); and (b) reduce expenditures by allowing workers to continue to work three years&#13;
beyond normal retirement age. In addition, legislation was enacted to include most working&#13;
relationships under the rubric of labor contracts, thus closing a loophole that enabled many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
contributors to pay pension payroll taxes at a low rate, based on the minimum wage. Government&#13;
expects to implement the last major element of the first-phase reforms anticipated in the CAS with&#13;
support from the project proposed in this report -- i.e., modernization and automation of the social&#13;
insurance system with a view towards strengthening the monitoring and control of SSF finances,&#13;
increasing compliance and improving services to program contributors and beneficiaries. Second-&#13;
phase reform measures outlined in the CAS, and elaborated in Chapter 1 of this report, are intended&#13;
to (i) further reduce public social insurance expenditures through raising the normal retirement and&#13;
pensionable ages and making other changes to the benefit formula; (ii) put in place the legislative and&#13;
regulatory framework for the development of privately-managed funded pension schemes; and&#13;
(iii) reduce payroll taxes, at least for workers in early retirement categories and preferably for all&#13;
workers. Provided these measures, once fully defined, meet technical criteria for a viable social&#13;
insurance program supportive of economic growth, the Bank's high case assistance strategy foresees&#13;
supporting Government's efforts via an adjustment loan. Thus far, as discussed in Chapter 1&#13;
(paras. 1.26 and 1.30), indications are that Government fully intends to follow through on second&#13;
phase reforms. Social Insurance Administration Project inputs to strengthen NSSI's analytical&#13;
capabilities can be expected to improve the technical content of reform proposals. The Government's&#13;
continued adherence to a program of scheduled changes in social insurance policy is in sharp contrast&#13;
to the slow progress with respect to some other development objectives and priorities, e.g., in&#13;
banking and the enterprise sector.&#13;
2.22          Linkages to Economic and Sector Work (ESW). Bank ESW has consistently&#13;
highlighted the need for improved collection compliance and has heightened Government sensitivity to&#13;
the benefits of proposed legislative changes to contain program expenditures (and, conversely, to the&#13;
costs of inaction). A grey cover report, Bulgaria: Public Finance Reforms in the Transition, World&#13;
Bank, 1994 included an in-depth analysis/evaluation of all social benefit programs in the early years&#13;
of the transition, indicating that failure to reshape the cash benefit system was creating (and would&#13;
continue to create) serious fiscal and efficiency problems. In particular, the report demonstrated that&#13;
despite substantial erosion of the real value of benefits due to incomplete indexing for inflation during&#13;
the period, expenditures for social insurance and social assistance increased as a share of GDP, from&#13;
11.4 percent in 1990 to 13.3 percent in 1992, in part due to the sharper fall in GDP (30%) than in&#13;
social insurance expenditures. The report further noted that elimination of general revenue subsidies&#13;
to the social insurance fund could not be achieved simply by the increases in earmarked social&#13;
insurance payroll taxes which Government had already legislated but would have to complemented by&#13;
efforts to (i) further rationalize and reduce program expenditures; and (ii) halt the rapid shrinkage of&#13;
the tax base, especially via stepped up efforts to increase tax compliance in the growing private&#13;
sector'.&#13;
2.23          Informal ESW carried out during the early preparation phase of the proposed project&#13;
updated the preceding assessment of the financial framework of the social insurance system and&#13;
evaltuated the impact of several policy alternatives under consideration by government. A technical&#13;
note and subsequent addendum prepared by Bank staff in May, 1995 used a simple economic and&#13;
demographic model to simulate the impact on SSF balances of three compliance scenarios (constant,&#13;
81 As noted in Chapter 1, shrinkage of the tax base was also attributable to the decline in total employment and&#13;
labor income, but it was acknowledged that reversal of this trend was tightly linked to broader changes in the&#13;
economy, generally unrelated to actions in the social protection area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
reduced and improved compliance) and a number of other revenue-enhancing and cost-reduction&#13;
policy measures then being considered by Government. Inter alia, the analysis contained in the note&#13;
suggested that without concerted efforts to restructure payroll tax administration and enforcement&#13;
activities of the type to be supported through the proposed project, the continued growth in the private&#13;
sector (which then accounted for about 40 percent of GDP), would likely translate into continuous&#13;
reductions in the effective compliance rate. This, in turn, would imply the need for continued&#13;
budgetary support to the SSF, even if cuts to program expenditures -- e.g., increased retirement ages&#13;
for women and men - were deemed politically feasible and enacted. (By the same token, cuts in&#13;
program expenditures were found to be clearly desirable on a number of counts related to the longer&#13;
term need to scale back the PAYG program to a size more appropriate to a market economy, even if&#13;
compliance could be improved).&#13;
2.24          Finally, as mentioned in Chapter 1, the most recent technical analysis of the social&#13;
insurance program was carried out in early 1996 using a detailed actuarial model of the Bulgarian&#13;
social insurance system, which was developed during project preparation using Japanese Grant funds.&#13;
As previously noted (para. 1.29 and Annex 2), preliminary simulations from this model indicate that&#13;
the first-reform phase legislative actions to reallocate employer payroll taxes between the SSF and&#13;
unemployment fund, introduce a 2 percent tax on employees and allow workers to remain on the job&#13;
voluntarily for three years beyond the normal retirement age would eliminate the need for budgetary&#13;
subsidies to the SSF, provided compliance can be maintained at least at current levels (i.e., assuming&#13;
improvements to tax administration to keep pace with private sector growth via the proposed project).&#13;
The realization of improvements in compliance anticipated as a result of project interventions would&#13;
compound this favorable impact, enabling the build-up of a three-month reserve to insure against&#13;
temporary fiscal distress and create room for future reductions to the payroll tax.&#13;
2.25          Public/Private Justification. As discussed in a major recent World Bank study -&#13;
Averting the Old Age Crisis, A World Bank Policy Research Report, 1994 -- government intervention&#13;
in the area of pensions are usually justified on grounds that private capital and insurance markets are&#13;
inadequate and redistribution to the poor is needed. It goes on to note, however, that the forms that&#13;
government intervention might take are several -- ranging from simply dampening inflation in the&#13;
hopes of encouraging voluntary savings, to regulating private pension funds and/or mandating and&#13;
publicly-managing PAYG pension schemes. The precise mix of Government interventions in the&#13;
pensions area should necessarily vary according to specific country circumstances (e.g, stage of&#13;
development of financial institutions/markets) and the country's own historical traditions. However,&#13;
based on extensive cross-country analysis, the study recommends a mixed system, including a&#13;
publicly-managed PAYG pillar, complemented by privately-managed occupational and/or individual&#13;
funded-schemes. This pattern is evident in many industrialized countries, which have pension systems&#13;
that rely on both PAYG public plans and additional, usually privately-managed, funded plans. Such a&#13;
mix of pension programs both enhances old-age income security (by spreading risks across several&#13;
income sources) and can promote growth due to the increase in aggregate savings implied by the&#13;
existence of funded pension schemes.&#13;
2.26          Given the above context, Government's present emphasis on, and project support for,&#13;
Bulgaria's public PAYG social insurance program is appropriate, particularly in light of the present&#13;
problems in the country's banking and financial sectors which make rapid growth in complementary,&#13;
private funded plans difficult (and perhaps undesirable) in the immediate term. At the same time,&#13;
there can be little doubt that the current Bulgarian program, which was instituted prior to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
communist era and expanded during communism, is too costly for a market economy, burdening the&#13;
wage bill of employers, encouraging informal economy (untaxed) activities, and discouraging formal&#13;
sector employment. Consequently, the issue is not whether a public program should be in place, but&#13;
how its design can be made efficient and affordable and how it might be complemented by funded&#13;
schemes in the medium- to longer-term. Government's two-phase social insurance reform program&#13;
(Chapterl), to which the proposed project is integral, is aimed precisely at streamlining the PAYG&#13;
program and concomitantly diversifying programs for old-age support. By supporting administrative&#13;
changes to the PAYG system which would make it more effective and less expensive, the project&#13;
would help set the stage for future across-the-board reductions in payroll tax rates, which in turn&#13;
would imply greater room for the parallel development of a private pension system consisting of an&#13;
occupationally based component and individual funded pension plans.&#13;
2.27          Adequacy of Policy Environment. A detailed description of the policy environment&#13;
within which the proposed project has been developed and will be implemented was included in&#13;
Chapter 1, Section D (paras. 1.20-1.30), so will not be repeated here. It should be reiterated,&#13;
however, that Government has now largely put in place the legislative and regulatory framework for&#13;
its first-phase reform program which aims at eliminating the need for budgetary subsidies to the SSF&#13;
and hopes to achieve first-phase programmatic reform goals of improving tax administration and&#13;
compliance via support from the proposed project. Implementation of second-phase reforms aimed at&#13;
scaling back the PAYG program (both costs and payroll taxes) and promoting the establishment of&#13;
complementary, private, funded pension plans is essential before the overall social insurance policy&#13;
framework can be judged to be fully satisfactory. As indicated in Chapter 1, these reforms are&#13;
currently being formulated (in part with assistance being provided through the Japanese Grant for the&#13;
proposed project) and there is cause for cautious optimism that they will be enacted on schedule given&#13;
the Government's timely implementation of first-phase reforms and the political consensus it is&#13;
building in support of second-phase measures. Achievement of the goals of the proposed project is&#13;
not, however, dependent on successful implementation of second-phase reforms. In fact, restructuring&#13;
of program administration to improve compliance, reduce abuse and internalize the benefits&#13;
calculation process within NSSI must be initiated forthwith, before increasing labor mobility and rises&#13;
in enterprise bankruptciesfbusiness closures render NSSI incapable of effectively enforcing mandatory&#13;
contributions or of obtaining full work records upon which to base pension calculations. Should such&#13;
a breakdown in program management be allowed to occur, the impact of any legislated changes to tax&#13;
rates and the benefit formula would be considerably blunted, implying in turn that the proposed&#13;
project is an essential element of the effort to complete the process of policy reform rather than the&#13;
reverse. In addition to its expected impact on program administration, the project's inputs to&#13;
strengthen actuarial projection and policy formulation capacity can also be expected to facilitate the&#13;
design/implementation of second-phase reforms.&#13;
2.28          Analysis of Alternatives. Four project alternatives were considered prior to selecting&#13;
the final configuration. The first alternative considered was that of not providing any project&#13;
support. The second alternative considered was only financing Component II, the Strengthening of&#13;
Institutional Capacity. Two alternatives were considered for Component I. The first would have&#13;
provided a system of information technology without reforming procedures. The second would have&#13;
used a different technology than that recommended for the project. The reasons behind the selection&#13;
of the preferred project alternative are described below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
2.29          Project Not Financed. The most obvious alternative to the project would be not to&#13;
finance a project at all. The justification for this alternative would be the incomplete progress in the&#13;
area of policy reform. Other countries, such as Hungary, have obtained information technology&#13;
systems on the expectation of subsequent policy reforms that, so far, have not materialized. In the&#13;
case of Bulgaria, the benefits from the project outweigh the costs, even in the case of policy reform&#13;
failure. The project can be economically justified in terms of savings from improved compliance&#13;
alone (see paras. 2.32-2.36 below). Further, the strengthening of the Actuarial Office and the&#13;
institution of the Policy Analysis Offices will enable the NSSI to evaluate reform proposals,&#13;
potentially leading to greater fiscal responsibility. Third, the continuation of the current system and&#13;
the institution of a new system both require the collection of earnings records within the NSSI instead&#13;
of at the enterprise. This collection would be impossible without a new information system.&#13;
2.30          Institutional Capacity Strengthened.  If only Component II were financed, the costs&#13;
of the project would total about US$3.1 million rather than US$32.3 million. In this case, the project&#13;
would cover the strengthening of the Actuarial Office, the institution of the Policy Analysis Office&#13;
and the Public Affairs Office, and the strengthening of human resource (personnel) management. If&#13;
funding were restricted to these items, the project would aid in the development of policies for the&#13;
future and would strengthen the administration of the NSSI, but the concrete gains to the proposed&#13;
loan which derive from the development of audit and compliance procedures backed by a modern&#13;
system of information technology could not be achieved. Further, access to the data provided through&#13;
the new information technology is an integral part of the development of the Actuarial Office and the&#13;
Policy Analysis Office.&#13;
2.31          Information Technology Supported (No Procedural Change). The original request&#13;
from NSSI officials envisaged an advanced computer system that could be used to develop an&#13;
earLiings-record data base, few changes contemplated either in terms of audit and enforcement or in&#13;
terms of service delivery. Lessons have been learned from other transition economies, such as&#13;
Poland and Hungary, which have, for one reason or another, purchased computer equipment or&#13;
implemented new information systems without addressing the need for changes in operational&#13;
procedures -- resulting in little net improvement in program outcomes. Discussion of these&#13;
experiences during project preparation and pre-appraisal convinced the NSSI authorities of the need to&#13;
change the agency's service delivery and collection procedures, including audit and enforcement, in&#13;
conjunction with the implementation of technological improvements. In the area of service delivery,&#13;
new procedures are needed to provide assistance to future beneficiaries, as the responsibility for the&#13;
work-history documentation process is transferred from employers to the NSSI. Further, new audit&#13;
methods are needed to deal with the proliferation of private-sector employers. Under current&#13;
procedures, the NSSI tries to audit every employer once every 2 to 3 years. The NSSI employs some&#13;
650 auditors to cover some 260,000 registered employers and would soon have to greatly increase&#13;
their number. Modern auditing methods, based on targeting and taxpayer profiles, do not require&#13;
audits of each and every enterprise. As NSSI officials learned of modem auditing alternatives, they&#13;
quickly requested training and technical assistance as a precondition to the design of the information&#13;
technology system. Consequently, the project will implement the new information technology system&#13;
based on changes in procedures that ensure more efficient NSSI operations.&#13;
2.32          Selection of Information Technology. The technical environment for the information&#13;
system selected by the NSSI is a UNIX based client-server with Windows-based workstations&#13;
supported by a relational data base system, under UNIX, to manage data storage. Prior to deciding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
upon this environment, another technical solution had been favored by NSSI, based on an ES9000&#13;
mainframe at the center and LANs at the regional offices. Here, too, technical discussions with NSSI&#13;
staff and exposure to the experience of neighboring countries convinced NSSI officials that the&#13;
solution now proposed would be by far the most efficient and affordable, given its relatively low&#13;
system maintenance costs. The capacity provided by the UNIX system for the maintenance of data-&#13;
base subsets at regional offices also minimizes the on-line requirements of the SIIS, thereby&#13;
containing what might otherwise be near-prohibitive telecommunications costs in the current Bulgarian&#13;
environment. The choice of a UNIX based client-server for support under the project represents an&#13;
important break-through in terms of computer technology within the Bulgarian government. (By&#13;
contrast, the Bulgarian Tax Administration is upgrading its system using more expensive and&#13;
antiquated main-frame technologies.)&#13;
2.33          Cost Recovery and Fiscal Impact. The project will increase revenues through&#13;
enhanced contribution collections and reduce expenditures through more efficient benefits&#13;
administration. Further, it will reduce the time-costs of clients by the more efficient delivery of&#13;
services. The improvement in contribution collections results in savings similar to those observed in&#13;
tax administration projects funded by the Bank. One evaluation of the impact of tax reform in&#13;
Argentina (Morisset and Izquierdo, 1993) found that nearly three-fourths of the improvement in VAT&#13;
collection could be attributed to improvements in tax administration procedures. The study controlled&#13;
for the impact of increases in GDP, reductions in inflation, and increases in the rate of taxation. In&#13;
general, the institution of improved tax administration procedures can be expected to increase&#13;
revenues measurably, particularly when macro-economic policies provide a stable environment.&#13;
2.34          As the detailed cost-benefit analysis in Annex 4 shows, the project represents an&#13;
extremely cost effective use of investment funds on a benefit-cost basis comparing the net gain in&#13;
revenue to the cost of the loan. Under pessimistic assumptions, revenues are assumed to increase by 1&#13;
percent relative to the base case (while reductions in expenditures as a result of improved monitoring&#13;
are deemed negligible). This translates into a small increase in the tax compliance rate, that is, the&#13;
percentage of potential revenues that are actually collected, from 63.4 percent to 64.0 percent. In&#13;
terms of loan efficacy, the benefit-cost ratio, the present value of fiscal savings to the cost of the loan,&#13;
is 15.2 to 1 in the year 2000, the first year that benefits from the new system can be expected.&#13;
Other indicators of loan success are equally favorable, the internal rate of return to the loan is 38.5&#13;
percent in 2004 compared to a nominal interest rate of 24.25 percent. The present value of savings to&#13;
the fund is BUL 14.5 billion by 2020. Under the pessimistic scenario of project performance,&#13;
increased revenues could be used to reduce the current tax rate by 1.67 percentage points in 2004.&#13;
This represents a reduction of 0.4 percentage points more than could be considered under current&#13;
operational policies.&#13;
2.35          A more optimistic scenario of the cost effectiveness and fiscal impact of the project&#13;
was developed based on a 10 percent increase in revenues. This rate of improvement is comparable&#13;
to that achieved in other countries (primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean, given the absence&#13;
of evaluated experience in Eastern Europe) following the implementation of World Bank-supported&#13;
tax administration projects with activities similar to those included in the proposed project. In&#13;
addition to revenue increases, the optimistic scenario assumes some reduction in expenditures,&#13;
particularly for short-term benefits, due to the system's greater ability to detect fraud and abuse. The&#13;
quantification of savings from the reduction of inappropriate payments is purely judgmental, since&#13;
there is little past experience with success in this area. For purposes of the analysis, overall&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
reductions in benefit payments of 1 percent for pensions and 10 percent for short-term benefits appear&#13;
to reasonably define the potential for improvements in expenditure control. Based on these more&#13;
optimistic assumptions, the benefit-cost ratio, defined as the present value of fiscal savings to the cost&#13;
ot the loan, is 92.8 in the year 2000, (the first year that benefits from the new system can be&#13;
expected) and rising thereafter. The internal rate of return to the loan would be 70.0 percent in 2004&#13;
compared to a nominal interest rate of 24.25 percent; and, the present value of savings to the fund is&#13;
BUL 141.5 billion by 2020. These savings imply an increase in the tax compliance rate from 63.4 to&#13;
69.6 percent. Perhaps the most favorable outcome of the optimistic scenario is the finding that the&#13;
project would allow for a reduction in the tax rate of 3.5 percentage points by 2004 while continuing&#13;
to allow the build-up of a contingency reserve, implying an effective average rate of 37.8 percent.&#13;
By the end of the projection period in 2019, the effective tax rate could be reduced by 5.8 percentage&#13;
points, even when a contingency reserve is created.&#13;
2.36          The initial 63.4 percent compliance rate used in the actuarial analysis may well&#13;
represent an optimistic forecast of the revenues under current collection procedures. The growth of&#13;
the private sector will tend to reduce collections in response to current high payroll tax rates.&#13;
Nonetheless, even if reduced revenues had been incorporated into the actuarial forecasts, the project&#13;
will still significantly raise contribution collections above the base level due to stronger auditing&#13;
procedures and enhanced NSSI information. The ratio of benefits to costs might even be greater&#13;
under more pessimistic compliance assumptions, since the new system is likely to have a greater&#13;
impact on private sector collections than on collections from state owned enterprises.&#13;
2.37          The economic benefits from the project are underestimated by the fiscal analysis&#13;
presented above as staff increases that would be necessary to maintain current operational procedures&#13;
are not taken into account, nor are decreases in services and compliance that would result from static&#13;
staffing patterns. The expansion of administrative expenses in the short term is already apparent.&#13;
Administrative expenses for 1996 are budgeted to be more than 250 percent higher than their 1994&#13;
levels in nominal terms. By contrast, pension payments are budgeted to rise by just over 190 percent&#13;
compared to1994. Other economic benefits stem from long-run reductions in reporting and&#13;
administrative requirements for employers. Gains to workers and pensioners will accrue in terms of&#13;
ease of the benefits application process, better and faster responses to inquiries, faster processing of&#13;
decisions, and quicker and more accurate payment procedures. Quantification of these benefits is,&#13;
however, not practicable. Finally, it should be borne in mind that implementation of Component II&#13;
provides the means to promote public policies that will support economic growth and development.&#13;
While it is not feasible to quantitatively estimate the impact of these institutional changes on the&#13;
economy as a whole, the importance of tools to strengthen the policy framework should not be&#13;
underestimated.&#13;
2.38          Institutional Capacity and Regulatory Framework. The commitment of the NSSI&#13;
to implement the project is unusually high. While the NSSI has recently become an independent&#13;
agency, it remains fully staffed with employees who formerly worked at the Ministry of Labor.&#13;
Because project preparation has taken place in close coordination with the NSSI, the project is&#13;
designed to adjust to the limitations of the NSSI to implement and administer the new system.&#13;
Further, the project has the necessary political support (from both the Council of Ministers and NSSI)&#13;
to ensure successful implementation. Nonetheless, taking into account NSSI's relatively limited&#13;
experience with the implementation of externally-supported projects and the magnitude of the changes&#13;
to operational procedures that will be implemented, the project includes activities to strengthen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
institutional capacity as follows: (a) staff assignments will be made to the PCU and training in project&#13;
management will take place prior to implementation; (b) project-supported technical experts will work&#13;
in close twinning arrangements with appropriate NSSI staff to ensure relevance of activities and full&#13;
transfer of knowhow; and (c) extensive training (combining on-the-job and hands-on methods with in-&#13;
country classroom teaching and limited external fellowships) will be provided within each project sub-&#13;
component.&#13;
2.39          The loan specifies a number of conditions that must be met prior to effectiveness to&#13;
ensure that the regulatory framework is in place. Perhaps most important is the designation of a&#13;
unique identification number that must be used by employers, employees and banks to record and&#13;
report contributions/payments and benefits eligibility. Further, the project requires that all necessary&#13;
staff and offices for project implementation are in place prior to effectiveness. In addition,&#13;
agreements on other regulatory changes are precondition for funding. Additional changes in the&#13;
regulatory environment are contingent upon the development of the project. For example, fines and&#13;
penalties in the area of collection compliance should be redesigned, but this redesign will take place in&#13;
conjunction with the technical assistance provided in the project.&#13;
2.40          Poverty Analysis. An early preliminary analysis of the structure of income and&#13;
social protection during the transition indicated that pensions were relatively evenly distributed across&#13;
all households, with low-income households receiving only a slightly higher share relative to their&#13;
numbers in the population. More recent analysis undertaken in the context of preparing a poverty&#13;
assessment for Bulgaria (scheduled for completion later this calender year) further documents the&#13;
situation of pensioners in relation to the incidence of poverty. This analysis indicates that if pensions&#13;
had not been available, nearly 1.7 times more households currently receiving pensions would have&#13;
fallen into poverty. Further analysis indicates that pensioners over age 70 have significantly higher&#13;
poverty rates than younger pensioners or others in the Bulgarian population, corroborating the&#13;
findings of an earlier study that reform should focus on enhancing pension benefits for those above&#13;
age 65. Of course, benefits were recently realigned to wages, reducing compression that had taken&#13;
place because of ad hoc flat-rate indexing. While data are not available to conduct an analysis of the&#13;
distributional impact of decompression, NSSI experts suggest that many very elderly pensioners will&#13;
have been helped by realignment as their pension-to-wage ratios tended to decline the most over time.&#13;
Nonetheless, if pension fund revenues are allowed to erode, the incidence of poverty among&#13;
pensioners could increase because restrictive indexing measures would again become necessary.&#13;
While this project does not directly influence benefit provision, its components may help promote&#13;
policies to combat poverty among the aged and disabled. First, the outcome of the project, buoying&#13;
revenues and preventing fraud and abuse, will enable governrnent to provide a better floor of&#13;
protection where protection is needed. While some might argue that the closer monitoring of benefit&#13;
eligibility could hurt the poor, a lack of administrative control is a generally inefficient means to&#13;
target poverty. Second, the institution of an Office of Policy Analysis, with a mandate to track the&#13;
economic status of the aged and disabled, will provide policymakers information to ensure that&#13;
policies are developed to maintain a minimum floor of protection for families entitled to pension&#13;
benefits.&#13;
2.41          Environmental Analysis. Environmental category C ("no appreciable environmental&#13;
impact') has been given consistent with the provisions of Operational Directive 4.01, Annex E. The&#13;
proposed project is not expected to have any environmental impact.&#13;

3.1          This chapter provides a summary of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) which was&#13;
prepared in conjunction with the Borrower and reviewed and deemed satisfactory by the Bank. The&#13;
PIP includes detailed information on the project description, costs, financing, management and&#13;
implementation arrangements, procurement, disbursements, audit reporting, and status of preparation.&#13;
The PIP is attached as Annex 5.&#13;
B. roject Cost&#13;
3.2          The total cost of the Social Insurance Administration Project is estimated at about&#13;
US$32.3 million, or about 4.4 billion Bulgaria Leva (BGL) equivalent, including contingencies, taxes&#13;
and duties. The total base cost is estimated at US$28.6 million. Physical contingencies are estimated&#13;
at US$2.4 million. Price contingencies between negotiations (May 1996) and the end of the four-year&#13;
project implementation period will amount to about US$1.4 million, or five percent of base cost. The&#13;
foreign exchange component is estimated at about US$22.5 million, including contingencies, or about&#13;
70 percent of total project cost. Taxes and duties are estimated at US$2.9 million equivalent. The&#13;
tax exempt status of technical assistance expenditure was confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
3.3          The total project cost includes fellowships, training, technical assistance, studies,&#13;
computer hardware and software, training materials, refurbishment of facilities, and incremental&#13;
recurrent costs geneiated by the project. The estimated cost distributed among project components is&#13;
shown in Table 3 of the PIP. Project costs are summarized by expenditure category in Table 4 of the&#13;
PIP. The project costs include about Leva 790 million or US$5.1 million to cover incremental&#13;
operating costs directly attributable to the project during the four-year implementation period.&#13;
Equipment operation and maintenance, and materials and supplies account for most of the project's&#13;
incremental recurrent costs. Incremental staff costs are negligible. Table 3.1 below shows summary&#13;
costs by expenditure accounts and project components:&#13;

C. Project Financing&#13;
3.4                 The proposed Bank loan of US$24.3 million will finance 75  percent of total project&#13;
costs, comprising 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost (US$22.5 million) and 26 percent of the&#13;
local cost, excluding taxes (US$1.8 million). Co-financing is being sought to cover technical&#13;
assistance and training costs for Component 2 (actuarial development, policy planning, public affairs&#13;
and human resource management). Possible donors include EU PHARE, USAID, and UK Know-&#13;
How Fund. The NSSI will finance the balance of project costs (US$8.0 million), including duties and&#13;
taxes. Incremental operating costs comprising equipment maintenance services and annual&#13;
maintenance costs of computers and software (US$5.1 million equivalent) will be financed entirely by&#13;
NSSI. Averaged over the project life, the NSSI portion of recurrent expenditures represents less than&#13;
one percent of the projected 1996 operating budget for the NSSI. The NSSI has requested and the&#13;
Bank has agreed to retroactive financing of up to US$2.4 million equivalent to facilitate advance&#13;
purchase of goods, works and services needed for project start-up activities, available as of&#13;
July 1, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
D. Administration of Project Funds&#13;
3.5          The Bank loan of US$24.3 million will be made to the Government of Bulgaria. The&#13;
Government will enter into a subsidiary Loan Agreement with the NSSI; and, signing of the&#13;
subskUary Loan Agreement will be a condition of effectiveness. On-lending terms to NSSI will be&#13;
the same as the terms of the Bank's loan to the Government. NSSI will provide counterpart funding&#13;
of about US$8.0 million from its own revenues. NSSI will be responsible for servicing the Loan to&#13;
the Government.&#13;
E. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
3.6          The project will be implemented over a four year period. Overall responsibility for&#13;
implementation of the project rests with the newly established and independent NSSI. Responsibility&#13;
for day-to-day coordination, management and monitoring rests with the Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) which has been established within the NSSI. It is assumed that the PCU will also be&#13;
responsible for the coordination of other donor-funded activities in the social security sector. To&#13;
carry out its functions, the PCU has been staffed by a Project Coordinator, supported by a core team&#13;
financed under the project. The core team comprises: (i) a project manager; (ii) a procurement&#13;
officer; (iii) an accountant; and (iv) an administrative assistant. All PCU staff will be financed by the&#13;
Governrment. Since the PCU staff are not familiar with Bank procedures, the necessary technical&#13;
assistance will be provided to ensure compliance with Bank guidelines, particularly in the area of&#13;
procurement.&#13;
3.7           A Project Advisory Group, headed by the Governor of the NSSI, has been&#13;
established. This group will be responsible for providing policy advice and guidance concerning the&#13;
project during the implementation period. The Advisory Group consists of the NSSI Governor, the&#13;
Project Coordinator, the Project Manager, and the team leaders of the technical working groups&#13;
which prepared the project proposals. During negotiations, assurances were provided that the&#13;
Project Advisory Group will be maintained during the project implementation period. The Advisory&#13;
Group will be assisted by special task forces which it will convene as necessary.&#13;
3.8          The project will require about 25 weeks of Bank supervision per year during the four-&#13;
year implementation period, front-loaded to assist sound project launch with a new borrower. This&#13;
relatively intensive supervision is needed because of the nature of the project, whose focus on radical&#13;
changes in NSSI operating procedures necessarily implies that the detailed design work which will be&#13;
undertaken during implementation be supervised closely by appropriate Bank technical experts. A&#13;
detailed project supervision plan is shown in the PIP, para. 34.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
F. Project Procurement Arrangements&#13;
3.9          Items to be procured will be grouped into major packages to encourage competitive&#13;
bidding and permit bulk procurement. Major procurement categories include: about US$13.3 million,&#13;
predominantly for computer hardware, off-the-shelf software, and vehicles to be procured through&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures; about US$8.1 million for technical assistance and&#13;
training, to be procured in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement of consultants;&#13;
US$1.0 million through international shopping (IS); and US$0.6 million through national shopping&#13;
(NS). National shopping will be in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. It is also&#13;
expected that computer applications software estimated to cost US$3.5 million will be procured&#13;
through limited international bidding because of the limited number of suppliers available.&#13;
Paragraphs 23-27 of the PIP provide details regarding procurement arrangements envisaged under the&#13;
project, and the standard procurement information is presented in Table 5 of the PIP (Annex 5).&#13;
Appropriate Bank standard bidding documents will be used for the project, and procurement will be&#13;
carried out in accordance with World Bank Guidelines.&#13;
G. Disbursements&#13;
3.10         The proposed project is expected to be disbursed over a period of four and a half&#13;
years, which is considerably shorter than the relevant profile in the Region (about seven years). This&#13;
project will be the second operation in the human resource sector in Bulgaria, with the first (Health)&#13;
scheduled to become effective by mid-1996. Therefore, the country disbursement profile for the&#13;
sector is speculative. However, the shorter implementation period for the present project reflects the&#13;
nature of the project as a narrowly-focused institutional development project in support of the first&#13;
phase of the Government's social security reform program, as well as the simplicity of the project's&#13;
design. Implementation and related disbursements will be facilitated by having defined equipment&#13;
lists and agreed terms of reference prior to project implementation (see Chapter m, PIP). The&#13;
closing date will be June 30, 2001. A summary of the disbursement plan is shown as Table 8 of the&#13;
PIP.&#13;
3.11         All disbursements against contracts for goods and works exceeding US$300,000&#13;
equivalent, and services and training exceeding US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firms and&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultants will be fully documented. For expenditures below&#13;
that level, disbursements will be made on the basis of certified Statements of Expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
This documentation will be made available for the required audit as well as to Bank supervision&#13;
missions, and will be retained by the PCU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit&#13;
report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. The processing, disbursement and&#13;
monitoring of the allocations of the proceeds of the Bank Loan and Borrower counterpart financing&#13;
would be managed by the PCU in coordination and consultation with the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
3.12         To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government will establish, maintain&#13;
and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account denominated in US&#13;
dollars. The authorized allocation will be US$2.0 million. However, during the initial stage of the&#13;
project, an amount limited to US$0.5 million will be deposited. When the aggregate amount of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
disbursement reaches US$5.0 million, the amount deposited in the Special Account will be increased&#13;
to the full authorized allocation of US$2.0 million.&#13;
H. Project Audit Reporting and Evaluation&#13;
3.13         The PCU will be responsible for coordinating annual project audits and for fulfilling&#13;
reporting requirements. With respect to project accounts, including the Special Account, they will be&#13;
audited in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank" (March 1982), and will be provided by the Borrower within six months&#13;
of the end of each fiscal year. Further information concerning auditing is provided in para. 31 of the&#13;
PIP.&#13;
3.14          In addition, the PCU will be responsible for preparing semi-annual progress reports,&#13;
which will include: a summary of progress under each component, proposals for rescheduling of&#13;
activities where necessary, actual disbursements and projections for the subsequent six-month&#13;
reporting period, as well as a thorough analysis of progress in implementation of the social security&#13;
reform program, as outlined in the Letter of Development Policy (see Annex 2). The PIP includes a&#13;
framework for systematic monitoring and evaluation of progress in project implementation. It&#13;
identifies a set of performance indicators to be used in project supervision. Progress reporting under&#13;
the project is provided in more detail in paras. 36-39 of the PIP.&#13;
3.15         During negotiations, assurances were provided that: (i) NSSI wiU prepare semi-&#13;
annual descriptive andfinancial reports on each project component, objective and activity&#13;
(beginning from the date of Loan Effectiveness); and (ii) a mid-tern review of the project wiU be&#13;
carried out in February 1999.&#13;
1. Status of Preparation&#13;
3.16         During the initial stages of preparation, the Borrower established five technical&#13;
working groups to develop project proposals for each component. That structure has remained in&#13;
place and has been a principal contributor to the preparation process. The functioning of these&#13;
working groups has promoted staff involvement in development of the project. These working groups&#13;
will be maintained during project implementation, and the heads at these groups will participate on a&#13;
regular basis in the Project Advisory Group (see Annex 5, para. 9, page 7). The basic policy agenda&#13;
has been discussed thoroughly, with NSSI, MOLSA and MOF management, with a view to achieving&#13;
the consensus necessary for its implementation. The Project Implementation Plan has been prepared,&#13;
and will serve as the basis for the more detailed Project Operational Manual (POM) which is now&#13;
being developed for use by the project management in the implementation of the project. The PCU&#13;
has been established, and is now fully staffed to ensure a smooth start-up to project implementation.&#13;
3.17         Additionally, important start-up activities have been initiated with regard to each of&#13;
the project's two components, using other sources of financing. A key activity which is already&#13;
underway with assistance from the Bulgaria Technical Assistance Loan (#3384-BU) concerns the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
design of reporting procedures and related software applications and staff training for reporting of&#13;
wage and contributions information by employers. Completion of this activity is expected to occur&#13;
prior to effectiveness of the present project, suggesting relatively smooth and timely start-up of the&#13;
project- supported central register. Secondly, Japanese grant funds have been used to develop a&#13;
Bulgaria-specific actuarial model and to begin training NSSI staff in its structure and applications for&#13;
planning purposes. These activities can be expected to facilitate implementation of project sub-&#13;
components related to actuarial projection and policy evaluation and planning. Finally, selected NSSI&#13;
staff have already participated in study tours and informal training in the public affairs area through&#13;
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) financing and are expected to form the&#13;
core of staff of the Public Affairs Office to be established with support from the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
4.1           The project's major benefits will be to (i) improve fund balances; (ii) reduce client&#13;
burden and improve services; and (iii) improve the policy making capacity of the NSSI for&#13;
sustainable, fiscally responsible, pension reform.&#13;
4.2           Improving Fund Balances. The Social Insurance Administration Project will help to&#13;
bring about long-run fiscal balance by improving contributions collections and by establishing a more&#13;
equitable, efficient and affordable basis for pensions and other social insurance benefits. Under the&#13;
project, fund balances can be expected to improve, even under pessimistic assumptions concerning the&#13;
effectiveness of the project in increasing revenues (Chapter 2, paras. 2.33-2.37). Under pessimistic&#13;
assumptions, fund revenues are assumed to increase 1 percent over base case projections phased in&#13;
over a three year period starting in 2000. The benefit-cost ratio, as measured by the present value of&#13;
fiscal savings relative to the cost of the loan, is 15.2 to 1 in the year 2000 and rising thereafter. By&#13;
2004, the internal rate of return is 38.5 percent compared to a real interest rate of 24.25 percent.&#13;
These savings assume a small increase in the tax compliance rate from 63.4 percent to 64.0 percent.&#13;
A more optimistic scenario of the cost effectiveness and fiscal impact of the project was developed&#13;
based on a 10 percent increase in revenues (a level consistent with that achieved in other countries,&#13;
following the implementation of activities similar to those included in the proposed project). This&#13;
scenario assumes that expenditures are reduced by 1 percent for pension payments and 10 percent for&#13;
short-term benefits. In this case, the benefit-cost ratio for the loan is 92.8 to I in the year 2000 and&#13;
rising thereafter. Under these assumptions, the internal rate of return to the loan in the year 2004 is&#13;
70.0 percent. These savings imply an increase in the compliance rate to 69.6 percent. By the end of&#13;
the projection period in 2019, the effective tax rate could be reduced by 5.8 percentage, even when a&#13;
contingency reserve is created.&#13;
4.3           Reduced Client Burden and Improved Service. Once the system is implemented,&#13;
benefits to employers from reductions in administrative burdens will start to be evident. Long-term&#13;
benefits from administrative simplification will accrue as employers will no longer be required to&#13;
furnish work history documents to establish employee pension eligibility and will no longer need to&#13;
maintain employee records for purposes of benefit calculation. Gains to workers and pensioners&#13;
include improvements in the benefits application process, faster responses to inquiries, faster&#13;
processing of decisions, and faster and more accurate payment procedures. These all will result in an&#13;
expanded economic payback for the project.&#13;
4.4           Improved Policy Capacity. Improved policy making tools and public relations can&#13;
support economic growth and development as policymakers use these tools to strengthen the policy&#13;
framework toward fiscally sustainable programs. While it is not feasible to estimate the impact of&#13;
these institutional changes on the economy, it appears likely that project activities related to&#13;
strengthening NSSI's capacity for policy evaluation and planning and actuarial forecasting will&#13;
significantly strengthen the technical underpinnings of Government's policy reforms in social&#13;
insurance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
4.5           The project faces four types of risk which are related to: (i) Government history of&#13;
wavering commitment to some Bank supported projects; (ii) implementation capacity; (iii) further&#13;
policy reform; and (iv) macroeconomic stability.&#13;
4.6           Government Commitment. In the past, Government's record has been extremely&#13;
poor irn regard to the disbursement of funds provided through the Bank. For example, the TAL was&#13;
recently extended as it had substantial undisbursed funds remaining in the account. Other&#13;
Bank-financed projects have been left in limbo in advanced stages of preparation, as political changes&#13;
eroded ministerial commitment to past agreements. Further, even with sectoral ministerial&#13;
commitment, support from the Ministry of Finance is also required. Such support has not necessarily&#13;
been forthcoming in the case of some projects. With regard to the proposed Social Insurance&#13;
Administration project, however, the Bank has entered into ongoing discussions with the Ministry of&#13;
Finance to ensure that the benefits to be derived from the project are widely known. Further, the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and the NSSI have recently agreed to the coordination of collection compliance&#13;
and are planning future cooperation, as well. This represents a new positive development for both&#13;
institutions.&#13;
4.7           Other Governmental risks should be mitigated, as well, as a result of timing of the&#13;
project and the new NSSI structure. Since March 1996, the NSSI has become a separate institute,&#13;
with complete independence in terms of operational policy. Consequently, NSSI management is less&#13;
subject to political influence than a normal line Ministry. Further, a stable parliamentary majority is&#13;
currently in power, securing continuity in the Supervisory Board to whom NSSI management must&#13;
report. Lastly, there is an unusually high degree of commitment to the project on the part of the&#13;
NSSI and the MOLSA, which increases the probability that Bank funds will be disbursed in a timely&#13;
manner to meet project objectives. In other words, even though the relationship between the Bank and&#13;
Government has been problematic in the past, the prospects for timely implementation of this project&#13;
are favorable because the interests of the NSSI and the Bank are essentially the same.&#13;
4.8          Implementation Capacity. A major risk faced by the project is the fact that NSSI,&#13;
as a new organization, has relatively weak institutional capacity for project implementation. Further,&#13;
NSSI is inexperienced in implementing externally financed projects. To strengthen the institutional&#13;
capacity and minimize these risks, staff assignments have already been made to the PCU and training&#13;
in project design and management and key staff counterpart appointments will take place prior to&#13;
project effectiveness. Further, the project will provide extensive training related to each component.&#13;
The commitment of Government to this project also reduces the implementation risk. Project&#13;
preparation has taken place in close cooperation with NSSI counterparts, and the project activities&#13;
have been designed for smooth implementation. The PCU will coordinate implementation of the&#13;
proposed project, as well as other donor-funded investments to ensure coherence with the social&#13;
security reform strategy.&#13;
4.9           Policy Reform. A second issue, related principally to the timing of Bank support for&#13;
this project, concerns the risk that Government's incentive to proceed with second phase policy&#13;
reforms will be reduced following the receipt of substantial external funding for needed investments in&#13;
its social insurance program (via the proposed project). Several factors appear to combine to mitigate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
this risk: First, Government has demonstrated substantial commitment to the second reform phase&#13;
with preparations already underway to formulate requisite legislation and build political support for&#13;
enactment of the reforms; second, to the extent that external support is a factor in influencing the&#13;
reform agenda, the expectation of Bank adjustment lending in support of second-phase reforms (as&#13;
described in the CAS) should outweigh the present (more restrictive) investment support in acting as&#13;
an incentive to stay on track with the structural reform of the social insurance program; and third,&#13;
project inputs to strengthen policy planning and actuarial forecasting should broaden the policy&#13;
dialogue beyond a few top officials and strengthen the technical underpinnings of specific reform&#13;
proposals thereby enhancing the impact of the reform. Of course, it is possible that the reforms taken&#13;
by government will not cap benefits or lower payroll taxes prudently. There can be no guarantees on&#13;
these issues. Nonetheless, the project will still have a beneficial impact by maintaining the system on&#13;
a relatively efficient operating basis without precipitating a complete collapse and social unrest. In&#13;
the worst case, further pension reforms would most likely be contemplated once the deleterious&#13;
economic effects of a bloated system are recognized in the future.&#13;
4.10          Macroeconomic Framework. At the current time, macroeconomic conditions in&#13;
Bulgaria leave much to be desired, with a crisis in the banking sector and the leva exchange rate&#13;
tumbling with respect to the dollar. In conditions of severe macroeconomic instability, efforts to&#13;
improve tax compliance have frequently proven to be unsuccessful. This risk is mitigated by the fact&#13;
that, given the timing for installing the information technology system, the new audit procedures will&#13;
not be able to be fully implemented until 1999 at the earliest. By that time, it is anticipated that&#13;
Government will have been able to bring the economy under control.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA&#13;
SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTE (NSSI)&#13;
ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.           The Project will be implemented by the newly created and independent National&#13;
Social Security Institute (NSSI) which until recently was the Social Insurance Directorate of the&#13;
Ministry of Labor (MOLSA). The Social Security Law of November 15, 1995 established an&#13;
independent Social Security Fund (SSF) which is now being administered by the NSSI, whose&#13;
responsibilities encompass policy and administrative operations of the Fund and social insurance&#13;
programs throughout Bulgaria. In the future, administration of other programs like unemployment or&#13;
health insurance may come under NSSI responsibility. While the Institute is responsible for only one&#13;
fund at the present time, it is planned that future legislative changes will add two or three additional&#13;
funds to the management responsibilities of the NSSI. The Institute currently administers benefit&#13;
programs for the social insurance programs. The transfer of staff and resources from the MOLSA to&#13;
the NSSI is expected to take place once NSSI is formally operational, i.e., when the members of the&#13;
Supervisory Board for the Institute have been nominated and approved by Parliament. This approval&#13;
is expected to be secured shortly. The Governor is in place, with his selection having been approved&#13;
by Parliament in late February 1996.&#13;
B. NSSI Structur&#13;
2.           The NSSI is undergoing organizational restructuring to improve its operations and&#13;
increase public confidence. The restructuring has been developed on the basis of four principles: (i)&#13;
minimal layers and units promote efficiency and teamwork; (ii) clear lines of authority and&#13;
responsibility enhance management and increase public confidence; (iii) flexible structure allows for&#13;
assumption of new responsibilities, e.g., unemployment benefits, without the need for reorganization;&#13;
and (iv) demonstration of a clear commitment to public service and protecting the integrity of the&#13;
program and the fund(s). The Supervisory Board is now in place and the organizational structure of&#13;
the new Institute has been implemented. Table 1.1-1.3 show the organogram for the NSSI.&#13;

3.            The various aspects of the senior management level are described in the sections&#13;
below:&#13;
(a)    Governor's Office. Overall responsibility for the Institute's policies and programs&#13;
rests with the Governor, appointed by Parliament. He is chairman of the Supervisory&#13;
Board.&#13;
(b)    Supervisory Board. The Board is tripartite in structure, with 14 members,&#13;
representing government, employers, and labor. All members of the Board have&#13;
been selected. Adoption of the new organizational structure for NSSI was one of the&#13;
first items on the Board agenda.&#13;
4.            Headquarters consists of six directorates and four offices reporting directly to the&#13;
Governor. The six directorates consist of (i) Pensions; (ii) Contributions and Short-term Benefits;&#13;
(iii) Social Insurance Policy; (iv) Administration and Personnel Management; (v) Budgeting and&#13;
Financial Activities; and (vi) Property and Spa management. Operations policy is the responsibility of&#13;
the Pensions Directorate and the Contributions and Short Term Benefits Directorate. As more&#13;
programs are assumed by the Institute, Directorates responsible for unemployment and heath care&#13;
could be added. The Contributions Division in the Contributions and Short-term Benefits is&#13;
responsible for collection, compliance, audit and appeals, as well as the development of plans,&#13;
policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the contributions requirements for all employers&#13;
and self-employed entrepreneurs. The Social Insurance Policy Directorate represents a new function in&#13;
the Institute, consisting of Statistics and Actuarial Analysis; Policy Analysis and Planning and Public&#13;
Relations. The Statistics and Actuarial Division will include statisticians and actuaries and will be&#13;
responsible for developing projections and anticipating needed adjustments to the fund and the&#13;
program, as well as producing statistical reports and analysis. The Policy Analysis and Planning&#13;
Division will be responsible for preparing and developing Policy options for consideration by the&#13;
Governor and the Supervisory Board. The Public Relations Division will be responsible for the&#13;
development and dissemination of information about programs administered by the Institute and&#13;
proposed changes to these programs through the use of media. The Administration and Personnel&#13;
Management Directorate would carry out a new function for the organization - personnel&#13;
management, compensation, labor agreements, and training and career development. The Budgeting&#13;
and Financial Activities Directorate would carry out the budget development and execution functions,&#13;
as well as accounting for the administrative budget of the institute. It also has the responsibility to&#13;
ensure that adequate space, equipment, and supplies are available for all Institute employees and&#13;
customers. The Property and Spa Management Directorate has the responsibility to inventory and&#13;
manage, preferably through contractors, the properties to be transferred to the Social insurance Fund.&#13;
Spa management is also included in its mandate. Consideration is being given, however, to&#13;
transferring these functions out of the NSSI. Four offices report directly to the Governor and make&#13;
up the Secretariate. The Information Technology Directorate, includes the current information&#13;
technology staff. It is responsible for computer programming and analysis, as well as systems&#13;
requirements and specifications. The Internal Financial Control Directorate has fiscal control over&#13;
and accountability for the income and expenditures of the Social Insurance Fund. In addition, offices&#13;
are in place to handle international relations and legal services.&#13;

Page 6 of 7&#13;
5.            Regional Advisory Committee. The day-to-day operations of the NSSI will continue&#13;
through the existing network of 28 regional offices. As at least an interim measure, a Regional&#13;
Advisory Committee will be selected composed of nine current regional managers, one from each of&#13;
the territories, reporting directly to the Governor. The Committee will be responsible for providing&#13;
advice on a regular basis to the Governor concerning regional policy for the Institute. Initially, the&#13;
Committee will be responsible for reviewing the current office structure and providing feasible&#13;
options for improving its effectiveness. One particular set of recommendations will concern the&#13;
selection of a few (nine or less) well-placed and staffed "supervisory" regional offices which would&#13;
function as "hubs" for the other regional offices. These offices could also offer inter alia specialized&#13;
support staff in the functional areas of information systems, public information, training, resources&#13;
and compliance. These supervisory offices would carry out the oversight function more effectively&#13;
than would a separate operational unit at Headquarters. This structure would minimize bureaucratic&#13;
layers and would set up a direct relationship to the Governor's office. It would also enable&#13;
Headquarters functional departments to support the regional office structure more directly.&#13;
C. Budget&#13;

REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA&#13;
SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
EVALUATION OF IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT REFORMS&#13;
1.           In recent years, Government has enacted a series of legislative changes intended to&#13;
stabilize the pension system financially, improve its transparency and redefine benefits. Further&#13;
reform of the pension system is anticipated now that the NSSI has been separated from the Ministry&#13;
of Labor. These changes would separate out professional funds from the general system as a means&#13;
to continue self-funded early retirement benefits. In addition, the normal pensionable age is likely to&#13;
be increased.&#13;
2.           Analysis conducted on the economic impact of measures taken since the separation of&#13;
the NSSI indicates that they will have brought the pension fund in balance in 1996. These changes&#13;
include the transfer of the payroll tax from the overfunded unemployment fund to the underfunded&#13;
pension fund. Additionally, an employee payroll tax has been added and the structure of pensions&#13;
reconfigured to make up for past losses in real pensions relative to wages. On the expenditure side,&#13;
the mandatory retirement age has been raised by three years, permitting employees to defer their&#13;
pensions and continue working, thereby reducing the overall expenditures on pensions. As a result&#13;
of these measures, the fund will no longer require subsidies from the budget. When the normal&#13;
retirement age-the age at which employees are first eligible for a full pension if they so choose--is&#13;
increased as well, the budgetary surplus will be increased sufficiently to reduce the payroll tax by&#13;
around 9 percent, from 39 percent to 30 percent of payroll.&#13;
Analysis Prior to Fund Separation&#13;
3.           Analysis conducted in Bulgaria prior to the preparation of this project, evaluating all&#13;
social benefit programs, indicated that Bulgaria's failure to reshape the cash benefit system created&#13;
serious fiscal and efficiency problems (Fox, forthcoming). Expenditures for social insurance and&#13;
social assistance increased as a share of GDP, from 11.4 percent in 1990 to 13.3 percent in 1992.&#13;
Although social insurance expenditures as a share of GDP rose during the transition, this increase was&#13;
caused by the over 30 percent fall in GDP. To meet recurring financing crises, earmarked payroll&#13;
taxes used to finance benefits were raised several times, with continuing budgetary deficits. Even&#13;
with sharp tax increases, tax receipts as a share of GDP only held constant. The rapid shrinkage of&#13;
the tax base was attributed to two factors: (a) decline in total employment and labor income; and (b)&#13;
poor tax administration, with taxes in the growing private sector simply not collected. The growing&#13;
gap between revenues and expenditures necessitated an increase in general revenue financing from 3.4&#13;
percent in 1990 to 15.8 percent in 1992.&#13;
4.            In response to rising deficits, Government enacted certain changes through the&#13;
Pension Reform Act of 1992, restricting eligibility and amending the old-age benefit formula (Fox,&#13;
1995). Beginning January 1993, early retirement ages were raised by two years and the minimum&#13;
length of service for a fMll pension was increased. Early retirement was no longer offered to laid off&#13;
workers. Total benefits were capped at three times the social pension.&#13;

5.            Economic and sector work carried out during project preparation indicated that many&#13;
of the issues identified earlier remained, notwithstanding the measures taken by Government in 1993.&#13;
In the April 1995 Aide Memoire, the mission presented preliminary findings based on an&#13;
economic/demographic simulation model developed for that purpose. The key findings indicated that:&#13;
(a)   improvements in contribution collection rates stemming from improved compliance&#13;
could significantly strengthen the financial status of the social insurance fund;&#13;
(b)    current financial balance could not be achieved solely through improved compliance&#13;
but had to be complemented by policies to reduce long-run expenditure; and,&#13;
(c)    while improvements in benefit generosity would be fiscally feasible if tax compliance&#13;
were improved and normal retirement ages extended, such changes should be&#13;
approached with caution as small changes in the projected ratio of wages to benefits&#13;
could create a long-run shortfall.&#13;
Analysis Related to Measures Taken Since Fund Separation&#13;
6.            A more rapid program of policy change was instituted after the NSSI separated from&#13;
the Ministry of Labor -- a measure intended, in part, to improve fiscal accountability and&#13;
transparency. As part of that process, starting in 1997, family benefits will become a budgetary&#13;
obligation outside the pension fund since they do not represent an insurable condition related to&#13;
employment. Further, the mandatory retirement age has been increased as a first step towards&#13;
reducing expenditures and increasing revenue. Finally, the earnings base used to calculate pensions&#13;
will be increased from the best three out of the last 10 years to the entire worklife, phased-in in one&#13;
year increments.&#13;
7.            The payroll tax used to finance pensions and short-term benefits was raised by 2&#13;
percent in 1996, offsetting a reduction in the payroll tax rate for unemployment insurance. As a&#13;
result, the social insurance contribution rate was increased from 35 percent to 37 percent of payroll&#13;
for most enterprises, while the unemployment insurance tax was lowered from 7 percent to 5 percent.&#13;
At the same time, benefits were realigned to wages, reducing the compression that had taken place&#13;
because of ad hoc flat-rate indexing. While data are not available to conduct a analysis of the&#13;
distributional impact of decompression, NSSI experts suggest that many very elderly pensioners will&#13;
be helped by the realignment, as their pension-to-wage ratios tended to decline the most over time.&#13;
Naturally, decompression will also help pensioners of all ages, if their benefits are not constrained by&#13;
the current pension cap.&#13;
8.            Simulations of the impact of these measures without project intervention were&#13;
conducted using a Government-supported actuarial model of the social insurance system using Japan&#13;
Grant funds.1' These simulations indicate that the pension fund would have run a small deficit&#13;
1' Japan Grant funds were also used to analyze the institution of a pension plan for teachers within the National&#13;
Social Security Institute (NSSI) to pay early retirement pensions or supplementary benefits to teachers who&#13;
postponed retirement. While this model has not been used to extend the Economic Sector Work (ESW), it&#13;
provides new tools with which to conduct future ESW and with which to evaluate proposed policy options.&#13;
&#13;

throughout virtually all of the projection period given the initial measures described above (Tables 1&#13;
and 2). The increased revenues more than offset benefit gains resulting from the recalibration of&#13;
pensions. As a consequence, the funding gap narrowed. If these had been the only measures taken,&#13;
the NSSI deficit funded by budgetary subsidies would have declined to less than 1 percent of NSSI&#13;
revenues for most of the first decade of the 21st century. It would have risen to over 1 percent of&#13;
NSSI revenues for most of the second decade of the 21st century, as the numbers of pensioners&#13;
increased through further population aging. The NSSI deficit would have remained less than 0.30&#13;
percent of GDP for most of the projection period.&#13;
9.            Additional measures were taken by Government, however, including the institution of&#13;
a two percent payroll tax on employees and the lifting of the mandatory retirement age by three years.&#13;
This latter step prevents employers from forcing employees into retirement if they prefer to continue&#13;
working. Simulations of these additional measures indicate that the employee payroll tax removes the&#13;
need for any budgetary financing, assuming that compliance stays the same. In fact, this increase&#13;
over-compensates for anticipated government subsidies, leaving room for tax reductions in the future&#13;
(Tables 3 and 4). Increasing the mandatory retirement age by 3 years compounds this favorable&#13;
impact (Tables 5 and 6). In the short run, these changes allow the NSSI to start to build up a fund&#13;
reserve that insures the NSSI against fiscal distress should unanticipated contingencies lead to an&#13;
unanticipated shortfall in revenues.2 While both steps bring the fund into financial balance, the&#13;
heavy tax burden may continue to discourage collection compliance and employment.&#13;
Analysis Related to Future Structural Reforms&#13;
10.           Government has indicated its willingness to address the underlying structural&#13;
problems of the social insurance system. Legislation is being developed to establish separate plans to&#13;
fund pensions for employees now entitled to special early retirement privileges. This would reduce&#13;
the direct payroll taxes for enterprises employing these workers. Government anticipates a proposal&#13;
for the substantive structural overhaul of the pension system to be introduced in late 1996. While&#13;
plans for pension reform are not final, they are likely to include measures to increase significantly the&#13;
normal retirement age and to revise the benefit formula, potentially limiting benefits relative to the&#13;
average wage.&#13;
11.           The same actuarial model was used to simulate the impact of raising the normal&#13;
retirement age by 3 years over a 6 year period, one of the major measures under consideration by the&#13;
NSSI. If such a measure were effected, the payroll tax rate could be reduced substantially while&#13;
continuing to maintain a fund ratio equal to 25 percent of expenditures as a cushion against fiscal&#13;
uncertainty. On average over the projection period, the payroll tax rate could be conservatively&#13;
reduced by 9 percent, bringing the basic payroll tax rate down from the current 39 percent to 30&#13;
percent of payroll (Tables 7 and 8).&#13;
2' Another measure that will reduce expenditures includes the gradual lengthening of the period used to calculate&#13;
the base pension. Future simulations will be conducted to measure the impact of this measure. Expenditure&#13;
reductions will depend on the steepness of the expected earnings profiles of Bulgarian workers and on the way in&#13;
which the earnings base is indexed for inflation. Since this measure is anticipated, current simulations actually&#13;
present a financial picture that errs on the side of conservatism.&#13;

LETrER OF SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY&#13;
To: Vice President&#13;
Europe and Central Asia&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
Bulgaria is seeking a loan from the World Bank in support of&#13;
our Social Insurance Project. The goal of the proposed project is to&#13;
update and modernize the administrative and organizational&#13;
capabilities of the social insurance system to meet the challenge of&#13;
providing affordable pensions and other benefits within a post -&#13;
transition economy characterized by increasing labour force&#13;
mobility. The loan will finance investments in record keeping,&#13;
collections and payment operations through the development of&#13;
administrative reforms and the implementation of a modem&#13;
automated insurance system. It will also finance the organization&#13;
the organization of new upgraded capabilities to improve policy&#13;
making by providing management the capacity to make ongoing&#13;
long-run actuarial projections, to evaluate the social and economic&#13;
impacts of current policies and alternative proposals, and to&#13;
develop a program of public affairs to interface with media in order&#13;
to provide regular information and education of the population, as&#13;
well as to create a modern and efficient potential for human&#13;
resources management.&#13;
Background&#13;
The main objective of Government economic policy&#13;
continues to be to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and restore&#13;
economic growth. This is to be achieved by substantial fiscal&#13;
adjustment and tight monetary policy, combined with the&#13;
acceleration of structural reforms and pro-active Government&#13;
measures to stimulate growth. While progress has not been&#13;
consistent in all areas, recent successes are apparent in the&#13;
slackening of inflation in 1995. our recent history of rapid inflation&#13;
and sharply declining production since transition, however, has had&#13;
a serious impact on the social sector with reduced public&#13;

confidence in the current social security system due to sharp&#13;
declines in the purchasing power of pensions and ever higher rates&#13;
of contributions.&#13;
Our problems financing pension payments are exacerbated by&#13;
an extremely large proportion of elderly in the population and a&#13;
significant segment of the work force covered by special early&#13;
retirement provisions. As a consequence, pension payments last&#13;
year took up over 10,5% of GDP.&#13;
To address the joint issues of a lack of public confidence in&#13;
the system and an excessive fiscal burden, we are undertaking a&#13;
systematic reform of the social insurance program in order to&#13;
transform it into a modem system of affordable insurance that&#13;
relies on a multi pillar approach of public pensions and privately&#13;
managed (though publicly regulated) mandatory and voluntary&#13;
programs and individual initiatives. This reform is part of the&#13;
Concept for social insurance and public assistance reform approved&#13;
with a Resolution of the Council of Ministers of March 18, 1996.&#13;
Current Reforms&#13;
In 1995 we passed legislation creating the necessary&#13;
preconditions for further reform. In particular, we created an&#13;
independent body, the National Social Security Institute (NSSI), to&#13;
collect social insurance contributions and make pension payments.&#13;
The Institute will also pay short term insurance benefits in the cases&#13;
of absences related to sickness and maternity. By creating a&#13;
separate institution we re-established transparency in the program&#13;
by separating the Social Insurance Fund from the State Budget.&#13;
This should enable accurate accounting of Fund revenues,&#13;
including payroll contributions from the State sector. On the&#13;
expenditure side, complete transparency is yet to be achieved since&#13;
at present family allowances such as child benefit continue to be&#13;
paid through the Social Insurance Institute. It is our intention to&#13;
separate these benefits from the fund as soon as it is&#13;
administratively feasible since, by definition, they do not qualify as&#13;
social insurance payments.&#13;
The Social Insurance Institute is under the general direction&#13;
of a Supervisory Board, consisting of representatives of employers,&#13;
employees and the government . This supervision is intended to&#13;
help restore confidence in the system by providing a clear stake in&#13;

management to those parties financing an d benefiting from the&#13;
system.&#13;
Several other measures to improve income and expenditures&#13;
within the system also have been passed as first steps towards a&#13;
broader structural reform. Recently the mandatory retirement age&#13;
has been raised by three years so that women over age 55 and men&#13;
over age 60 can choose to stay on their jobs. Second, employers&#13;
must now make the entire social insurance contributions on the&#13;
wage payments. We have changed contribution requirements so&#13;
that employees directly pay a 2 percent payioll tax to finance social&#13;
insurance. This change was  adopted as a first step towards&#13;
introducing a strict connection between pension benefits and&#13;
pension contributions. Further, after years of ad hoc lump sum&#13;
indexing, we have realigned benefits to relate them more closely to&#13;
their initial relationship  with the overall distribution of wages&#13;
(while continuing to cap benefits at a maximum payment). By&#13;
restoring fairness to the benefit structure, these changes should also&#13;
help increase the credibility of the social insurance system overall.&#13;
Our Future Strategy&#13;
The guidelines for future policy changes incorporate a system&#13;
of social insurance combined with the provision of funded, privately&#13;
managed, supplementary pensions offered on an occupational,&#13;
employment, or individual basis. The pension fund would be part of&#13;
a broader Social Insurance Institute that would   eventually&#13;
encompass: (I) a pension fund; (ii) a sickness and maternity fund;&#13;
(iii) an unemployment fund and (iv) an occupational injury and&#13;
disability fund.&#13;
The system will be reformed based on classic insurance&#13;
principles in which contributions are collected based on the&#13;
earnings paid over individual's entire working lives. Further,&#13;
individuals' future pensions will depend upon their total&#13;
contributions with some limited adjustments possible for equality&#13;
reasons. Benefits that are entirely a form of social assistance will be&#13;
separated from the fund. The system will be evaluated on the basis&#13;
of actuarial forecasts which will provide information on revenue&#13;
requirements and benefit constraints. The financial stability of the&#13;
system will be ensured by policv adjustments made on the basis of&#13;
these requirements. However, the intention is that the system will&#13;

build up a sufficient level of funding reserves to enable promises to&#13;
be met. The system will be financed through employer and&#13;
employee contributions, with transfers from the state budget&#13;
eventually limited to governmental pension obligations.&#13;
The issues related to restructuring the system will be settled&#13;
with the passage of a package of material laws.&#13;
For starting and developing the reform the following bills&#13;
should be drafted and passed by the Parliament by the autumn of&#13;
1996:&#13;
In the new Pensions Act the retirement conditions should be&#13;
made stricter by raising the average retirement age and the&#13;
required years of service, and, at the same time, by providing the&#13;
possibility for early retirement with reduced pension. Through the&#13;
formula the size of the pension should be directly related to the&#13;
contributions of the employee.&#13;
The Empoymnent Incentives and Unemployment Protection&#13;
AcLwill provide for the institutionalisation of Professional&#13;
Qualification and Unemployment Fund as part of the social&#13;
insurance system. This will require setting up the fund, separating it&#13;
from the structure of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare&#13;
and establishing new administrative and financial relations with the&#13;
National Employment Office.&#13;
The Voluntary and Additional Social Insurance Act should&#13;
settle the issues resulting from the establishment of corporate,&#13;
professional and private social insurance organisations working on&#13;
the basis of free negotiations between legal entities - social security&#13;
providers and individuals and social insurance organisations as&#13;
typical market objects. The Act should determine the level and&#13;
forms of state regulation (monitoring, supervision and, if necessary&#13;

The new Act on Sickness and Maternity Fund will provide&#13;
for the rights, the procedure and the size of the social insurance&#13;
payments in the cases of temporary incapacity for work or&#13;
temporary reduced capacity for work which compensate part of the&#13;
earnings of the employees and part of the medical expences. This&#13;
bill will solve the problem of medical insurance by extending the&#13;
powers of the current system of short-term benefits. The adoption&#13;
of this idea will mean rejection of the scenarios for setting up a&#13;
separate Medical Insurance Fund. At the same time, the issue of&#13;
state budget financing of science, education and training of staff&#13;
and allowances for the state organised health agencies which&#13;
should be subordinated to the Ministry of Health and financed by&#13;
the state budget (The Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute, the&#13;
emergency medical services etc.) needs to find its positive solution.&#13;
This bill can realistically be drafted and passed in the beginning of&#13;
1997.&#13;
At the end of next year such approach will provide the&#13;
following:&#13;
- a modernized state mandatory social insurance system, managed&#13;
based on the principle of parity by all participants, financed by four&#13;
autonomous social insurance funds (Pension Fund, Unemployment&#13;
Fund, Sickness and Maternity Fund and Occupational Injury and&#13;
Illness Fund) with a joint scientific research, actuarial, information&#13;
and control systems;&#13;
- a developed market (in addition to state social insurance) of&#13;
additional voluntary insurance paid by corporate, professional&#13;
(industry branch) and private insurance institutions licensed&#13;
monitored by the state and with tax incentives from the state.&#13;
In the future the effort will be directed towards guaranteeing&#13;
the level of benefits paid by the state system and their increase on&#13;
the account of the additional and voluntary insurance.&#13;
Each year a re-distribution of weight of the participation of&#13;
state, employers and employees will be made with the objective to&#13;
stabilize the state social insurance system. In addition to that with&#13;
the growth of the level of employment conditions will be created to&#13;
reduce the size of contributions. The changed retirement conditions&#13;
- increased retirement age and increased number of years of&#13;
service - will facilitate the latter. At the same time a legal possibility&#13;
will be provided for earlier retirement with respectively reduced&#13;
pension .&#13;

The retirement obligations for the first and second categories&#13;
of labour will be changed whereby for the differences in the length&#13;
of social insurance a system of occupational insurance schemes or&#13;
schemes the place of work will be set up.&#13;
With exeption of a few selected occupational schemes such as&#13;
those for the armed forces, police etc, the bulk of the occupational&#13;
schemes will be privately managed.&#13;
Of course, throughout the reform, transitional issues will have&#13;
to be addressed as the system is transformed from the old&#13;
framework to one that is contribution-related and partly funded.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
We feel that the Social Reform Project will provide a major&#13;
source of assistance. That will allow us to implement the policy of&#13;
reforms we have started and prepare for anticipated changes to the&#13;
benefits formula.&#13;
In the absence of a system   that records individual earnings&#13;
for the working population, the social insurance reform cannot be&#13;
changed to one which will pay pensions and short-termn benefits on&#13;
the basis of contributions. Further, it is crucial that we have the&#13;
capacity to analyze the financial and economnic impact of reform&#13;
before specifying the precise levels of benefits and contributions&#13;
required in the future.&#13;
Reform notwithstanding, the Social Reform Project is crucial&#13;
to the continuation of current procedures prior to the phase-in of&#13;
the new system. With increased labour force mobility and the&#13;
possibility of periodic or sustained periods of unemployment among&#13;
the working age population, it is imperative to be able to track&#13;
pension entitlements across employers and states of labour force&#13;
activity.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA&#13;
SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
COST RECOVERY AND FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
1.            The project will increase revenues through enhanced contribution collections and&#13;
reduce expenditures through more efficient benefits administration. Further, it will reduce the time-&#13;
costs of clients through more efficient delivery of services. The improvement in contribution&#13;
collections will result in savings similar to those observed in tax administration projects funded by the&#13;
Ba,nk. One evaluation of the impact of tax reform in Argentina (Morisset and Lzquierdo, 1993) found&#13;
that nearly three-fourths of the improvement in VAT collection could be attributed to improvements in&#13;
tax administration procedures. The study controlled for the impact of increases in GDP, reductions in&#13;
inflation, and increases in the rate of taxation. In general, the institution of improved tax&#13;
administration procedures can be expected to increase revenues measurably, particularly when macro-&#13;
economic policies provide a stable environment.&#13;
2.            The project represents an extremely cost-effective use of Bank funds on a benefit-cost&#13;
basis, comparing the net gain in revenue to the cost of the loan to the Bank and other donors.1'&#13;
Under pessimistic assumptions, revenues are assumed to increase by 1 percent relative to the base&#13;
case. This translates into a small increase in the tax compliance rate, that is, the percentage of&#13;
potential revenues that are actually collected, from 63.4 percent to 64.0 percent.v In terms of loan&#13;
efficacy, the benefit-cost ratio, the present value of fiscal savings to the cost of the loan, is 15.2 to 1&#13;
in the year 2000, the first year that benefits from the new system can be expected (Table 5).-Y Other&#13;
indicators of loan success are equally favorable; the internal rate of return to the loan is 38.5 percent&#13;
in 2004 compared to a nominal interest rate of 24.25 percent. The present value of savings to the&#13;
fund is BUL 14.5 billion by 2020. Under the pessimistic scenario of project performance, increased&#13;
revenues could be used to reduce the current tax rate by 1.67 percentage points in 2004. This&#13;
represents a reduction of 0.4 percentage points more than could be considered under current&#13;
operational policies.&#13;
1' Recurring costs to the NSSI have not been considered. These would raise administrative expenses by, at most,&#13;
11 percent on an ongoing basis. These expenses would have to be balanced by countervailing personnel&#13;
expenditures if audit procedures were not changed to incorporate modem methods. Further, other operating costs&#13;
related to communications can be expected to decline over time as a result of modernized telecommunications.&#13;
v These estimates are based on the Actuarial Model constructed by John Wilken and John Patrick Wiesn for the&#13;
NSSI under Japan Grant funding. The model incorporates assumptions about real GDP growth and inflation basd&#13;
on World Bank mid-term projections to 2005, judgementally extended to 2020. Labor force estimates come from&#13;
the Wilken/Wiese model and are based on their demographic projections and labor force participation rate of 56.9&#13;
percent for men age 15 and over and 47.3 percent for women age 15 and over. Trends in these vaiabla are&#13;
provided in Table 9.&#13;
3 Tables 1 and 2, respectively, present figures on the operations and the income rates for the fund under&#13;
current policies, with no loan provided. Tables 2 and 3, respectively, present figures on the operations and the&#13;
income rates for the fund under the pessimistic assumptions.&#13;

Page 2 of 12&#13;
3.             A more optimistic scenario of the cost effectiveness and fiscal impact of the project&#13;
was developed based on a 10 percent increase in revenues. This rate of improvement derives from&#13;
World Bank experience with tax administration projects in other settings. Another source of savings&#13;
would be the reduction of expenditures, particularly for short-term benefits, due to the system's&#13;
greater ability to detect fraud and abuse. The quantification of savings from the reduction of&#13;
inappropriate payments is purely judgmental, since there is little past experience with success in this&#13;
area. Overall reductions in benefit payments of 1 percent for pensions and 10 percent for short-term&#13;
benefits appear to define reasonably the potential for improvements in expenditure control.&#13;
4.            According to the more optimistic assumptions, the benefit-cost ratio defined as the&#13;
present value of fiscal savings to the cost of the loan is 56.9 in the year 2000, the first year that&#13;
benefits from the new system can be expected (Table 8).' Under these assumptions, the internal rate&#13;
of return to the loan would be 70.0 percent in 2004, compared to a nominal interest rate of 24.25&#13;
percent. The present value of savings to the fund is BUL 141.5 billion by 2020. These savings&#13;
imply an increase in the tax compliance rate from 63.4 to 69.6 percent. Perhaps the most favorable&#13;
outcome of the optimistic scenario is the finding that the project would allow for a reduction in the&#13;
tax rate of 3.5 percentage points by 2004, while continuing to allow the build-up of a contingency&#13;
reserve, implying an effective rate of 37.8 percent.5' By the end of the projection period in 2019, the&#13;
effective tax rate could be reduced by 5.8 percentage points to 35.5 percent if a contingency reserve&#13;
had been created.@&#13;
5.            The compliance rates used in the actuarial analysis may represent an optimistic&#13;
forecast of revenues under current collection procedures. The growth of the private sector will tend&#13;
to reduce collections in response to current high payroll tax rates. In addition, to the extent that&#13;
private-sector growth is concentrated among small employers, collection rates will naturally decline as&#13;
effective audit and enforcement is more difficult to implement among small firms, particularly under&#13;
current administrative conditions. Declining compliance would have a long-term secondary impact on&#13;
expenditures, as well, as noncomplying businesses would be unlikely to keep records for their&#13;
employees for either short-term or long-term benefit eligibility. In an atmosphere of fraud and abuse,&#13;
however, revenues would be likely to decline more than expenditures, particularly since ultimate&#13;
declines in pension entitlements would only become evident in the out years. Nonetheless, even if a&#13;
declining compliance base and less favorable revenues were assumed in additional actuarial forecasts,&#13;
the impact of implementing the project with stronger auditing procedures and better information&#13;
would be to significantly raise collections above the base level. The ratio of benefits to costs might&#13;
4' Tables 6 and 7, respectively, present figures on the operations and the income rates for the fund under the&#13;
optimistic assumptions.&#13;
5 The effective tax rate reflects a basic tax rate of 39 percent for most workers and tax rates of 49 percent and&#13;
54 percent for workers entitled to special early retirement benefits. The small fluctuations in the effective tax&#13;
rate reflect fluctuations in the distribution of workers at alternative rates.&#13;
Y The payroll tax rate could be reduced even more if legislation were passed to raise the retirement age by 3 years.&#13;
Under those circumstances, the effective tax rate could be lowered from 41.2 percent of payroll to 30.1 percent by&#13;
2004 and 28.6 percent by 2019.&#13;

actually be stronger if more pessimistic compliance assumptions were used, since the new system is&#13;
likely to have a greater impact on private-sector collections than on those for state owned enterprises.&#13;
6.            The economic benefits from the project are underestimated by the fiscal analysis&#13;
presented above, as staff increases that would be necessary to maintain operational procedures are not&#13;
taken into account, nor are decreases in services and compliance that would result from static staffing&#13;
patterns. The expansion of administrative expenses in the short term is already apparent.&#13;
Administrative expenses for 1996 are budgeted to be more than 250 percent higher than their 1994&#13;
levels in nominal terms. By contrast, pension payments are budgeted to rise by just over 190 percent&#13;
compared to 1994.&#13;
7.            Odter economic benefits stem from long-run reductions in reporting and administrative&#13;
requirements for employers. Gains to workers and pensioners will accrue in terms of ease of the&#13;
benefits application process, better and faster responses to inquiries, faster processing of decisions,&#13;
and quicker and more accurate payment procedures.&#13;
8.            The implementation and expansion of analytic and information capacities within the&#13;
NSSI provide the means to promote public policies that will support economic growth and&#13;
development. While it is not feasible to estimate the impact of these institutional changes on the&#13;
economy as a whole, the importance of tools to strengthen the policy framework cannot be&#13;
underestimated.&#13;

SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISIRATION PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
This Project Implementation Plan (PIP) reflects largely the outcomes of the December&#13;
1995 and February 1996 missions, and the proposals and technical discussions with the working&#13;
groups established under the supervision of the National Social Security Institute (NSSI), as well as&#13;
subsequent discussions concerning refinements of the project scope and content." The PIP presents&#13;
the general framework for project implementation by the Borrower, and outlines: (a) the project&#13;
objectives; (b) project management and implementation responsibilities and activities; (c) project&#13;
costs and financing plan; (d) procurement arrangements; and (e) implementation, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation processes and procedures. While the implementation of the project is inherently dynamic,&#13;
this PIP seeks to clearly outlines the general principles agreed with the NSSI, according to which the&#13;
project will be carried out.&#13;
" A copy of the Government's detailed Project Proposal is available in the Project files and may be obtained from&#13;

I. THE, PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
1.           The overall goal of the proposed Project is to support and sustain the Government's&#13;
social insurance reform program, as described in Chapter 1 of the SAR and outlined in the&#13;
Government's Letter of Sectoral Development Policy. Specifically, the Project aims to support the&#13;
Government's current reform goals of eliminating the budgetary subsidy for social insurance payments&#13;
due through the achievement of fiscal balance in the Social Security Fund (SSF) and laying&#13;
groundwork for future reforms aimed at more fundamental restructuring of Bulgaria's system for&#13;
guaranteeing income security through social insurance. Therefore, the Project would:&#13;
(a)   strengthen efforts to increase the NSSI's overall operational efficiency in today's&#13;
emerging market economy, with a focus on reversing the trend towards reduced tax&#13;
compliance which is undermining the financial stability of the public PAYG social&#13;
insurance program; and&#13;
(b)   strengthen the institutional capacity of the newly created NSSI to perform key policy&#13;
formulation and evaluation functions and better manage available resources.&#13;
B. Proiect Description&#13;
2.           The proposed Project has two components: Increasing Compliance and Operational&#13;
Efficiency and Strengthening Institutional Capacity, and will be implemented over a period of four&#13;
years. Total project costs including contingencies, taxes and duties are estimated at US$32.3 million&#13;
equivalent (US$28.6 million base cost). Detailed costs of each component are shown in Appendix 1.&#13;
The Project will finance equipment, external and local training and specialist services, civil works for&#13;
NSSI office upgrading, and incremental operational costs generated by the investments.&#13;
II. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Management&#13;
3.           Overall responsibility for implementation of the Social Insurance Administration&#13;
Project rests with the newly establishcd and independent NSSI which until recently was the Social&#13;
Insurance Directorate of the Ministry of Labor. Responsibility for day-to-day coordination,&#13;
management and monitoring rests with the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which has been&#13;
established within the NSSI. It is assumed that the PCU will also be responsible for the coordination&#13;
of other donor-funded activities in the social security sector. In order to carry out its functions, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                          Annex 5&#13;
Page 5 of 31&#13;
PCU has been staffed by a Project Coordinator, supported by a core team financed under the Project.&#13;
The core team comprises: (i) a project manager; (ii) a procurement officer; (iii) an accountant; and&#13;
(iv) an administrative assistant. The Project Coordinator reports directly to the Governor of the&#13;
NSSI, and the rest of the PCU staff report directly to the Project Coordinator. The Project&#13;
Coordinator is responsible for coordination of project and other donor-related activities within the&#13;
NSSI, as well as ensuring coordination between NSSI and the MOLSA. To assist this team, limited&#13;
external technical support for the PCU will be provided for under the Project, mainly in the&#13;
development and implementation of procurement procedures and organization of training programs,&#13;
considering the limited experience of NSSI in these areas.&#13;
4.           The heads of the five technical working groups that were established within NSSI to&#13;
design project sub-components and the Project Coordinator will form a Project Advisory Group which&#13;
will be headed by the NSSI Governor. The members of the group have been appointed by the NSSI&#13;
upon recommendation of the Project Coordinator. The number of members of the Group,&#13;
units/agencies to be represented in the group, and the frequency of meetings may be revised as&#13;

D. Implementation Arrangements by Component&#13;
10.          The paragraphs below discuss implementation arrangements and activities for each of&#13;
the two components of the Project. Detailed cost tables and implementation schedules related to the&#13;
specific components are found in the Appendices to this Annex.&#13;
Component 1: Increasing Compliance and Operational Efficiency&#13;
11.          Integrated Social Insurance Administration. This component will be implemented&#13;
at the national level by the Information Technology Department of NSSI, in cooperation and&#13;
coordination with the other NSSI departments and the PCU. This Department will report directly to&#13;
the Governor of NSSI. The Information Technology Department consists of three divisions:&#13;
Operations and Information Technology, Automation, and Telecommunications. These divisions will&#13;
coordinate closely to ensure that the software programs selected meet the technical needs of benefit&#13;
computation and payment processes. The Operations and Information Technology Division,&#13;

accordance with Bank Guidelines, and will support other units of NSSI which will be receiving&#13;
computer equipment and software. The Operations and Information Technology Division will be&#13;
responsible for providing continuous support to the receiving institutions during the installation and&#13;
testing of hardware, loading of software and training of users in coordination with the suppliers. It&#13;
will also be responsible for ensuring compatibility of hardware and software for the new systems, and&#13;
coordination between suppliers. As described in paras. 2.4-2.8 of the Staff Appraisal Report, the&#13;
project will support establishment of an individual central register, and a uniform UNIX-based&#13;
information system at regional and central level social insurance offices. The preliminary data&#13;
collection activity to ensure that the data base is established before January 1997 began in March&#13;
1996, using alternative sources of funds. For both the central registry and the information system,&#13;
the Information Technology Department will be responsible for ensuring close coordination across&#13;
other NSSI Departments. Small-scale upgrading of regional offices and Headquarters to accommodate&#13;
the new technology will be the overall responsibility of the Budgetting and Financial Activities&#13;
Department. Close coordination with the Operations and Information Technology Division will also&#13;
be essential to ensure that the upgrading of facilities to accommodate the new computers takes into&#13;
account hardware and software specifications. The Facilities and Supplies experts of this department&#13;
will supervise the work of the engineering consultants, prepare bid packages and bidding documents&#13;
for the works, and in collaboration with the PCU, conduct and evaluate bids, award contracts, and&#13;
supervise the performance of contractor and supplier contracts. The Information Technology&#13;
Department will also be responsible for the organization and carrying out of the training programs for&#13;
this component. Support to the training will be provided as needed by the Personnel Management&#13;
Division of the Administration and Personnel Management Department.&#13;
Component 2: Strengthening Institutional Capacity&#13;
12.          Policy Planning and Analysis. The new Social Insurance Policy Department will&#13;
have overall responsibility for this subcomponent. The department will comprise three divisions:&#13;
Statistics and Actuarial Analysis, Policy Analysis and Planning, and Public Relations. Coordination&#13;
among all three of these divisions and the PCU will be an essential aspect of project management.&#13;
(a)    Actuarial Division. The Social Insurance Policy Department will be responsible for&#13;
implementation of project activities relating to actuarial and data base development.&#13;
The Statistics and Actuarial Analysis Division will be responsible for coordinating&#13;
activities involved in staff selection (four additional staff will be added as a result of&#13;
the Project) and the specialized training program to be carried out under the Project.&#13;
Support to this training program would be supplied as needed by the Personnel&#13;
Management Division of the Administration and Personnel Management Department.&#13;
Responsibilities will also include coordination of the technical assistance experts&#13;
supporting the development of the actuarial model and data base. In cooperation with&#13;
the Information Technology Department, the Division will be responsible for drawing&#13;
up technical specifications for additional computer equipment, and selecting&#13;
appropriate software programs.&#13;
(b)    Policy Evaluation and Analysis Division. The Social Insurance Policy Department&#13;
will have overall responsibility for implementation of project activities relating to&#13;
establishment and operation of this division. The Policy Analysis and Planning&#13;

Page 9 of 31&#13;
Division will be responsible for coordinating staff selection and specialized staff&#13;
training. Because this is a new unit, seven staff in total would be needed, either&#13;
through hiring or transfer. The Personnel Management Division of the&#13;
Administration and Personnel Management Department will provide support as needed&#13;
for these courses. Responsibilities will also include coordination of the technical&#13;
assistance experts supporting the development of a plan for the production of studies&#13;
and reports, and establishment of data sources and a training program on the use of&#13;
policy analysis in government-sponsored social insurance programs. In cooperation&#13;
with the Information Technology Department, the division will be responsible for&#13;
drawing up technical specifications for additional computer equipment and selecting&#13;
appropriate software programs.&#13;
(c)    Public Relations Division. The Social Insurance Policy Department will have overall&#13;
responsibility for implementation of project activities related to the establishment and&#13;
operation of this division. The Public Relations Division will be responsible for staff&#13;
training, and coordination of the work of technical assistance experts supporting&#13;
development of a public affairs program. Because this is new unit, six staff in total&#13;
will be needed, either through hiring or transfer. The division will also be&#13;
responsible, with support from the Information Technology Department for drawing&#13;
up technical specifications for additional computer and media equipment and selecting&#13;
appropriate software.&#13;

will have overall responsibility for implementation of this subcomponent. With coordination of the&#13;
PCU, the Department will oversee the work of technical assistance experts hired under the Project for&#13;
this component, as well as departmental staff training activities. Specific responsibility for training&#13;
courses for the NSSI will lie with the Personnel Management Division which will hold management&#13;
and staff training courses, as well as providing support to specialized training being carried out in&#13;
other divisions within NSSI.&#13;
E. Detailed Project Activities by Component&#13;
14.          Detailed activities under each component are summarized below. Detailed&#13;
information is available in the project proposals prepared by the working groups under the guidance&#13;
of NSSI. A detailed project implementation schedule is given in Appendix 3.&#13;
(a)   Increasing Compliance and Operational Efriciency&#13;
(i)    Automation Management. Overall advisory support to the establishment of&#13;
the information system will be provided by two technical assistance experts: a&#13;
Social Security Management Specialist, and an Information Technology&#13;
Management Specialist with quality assurance expertise. The Bank will&#13;
finance a technical assistance contract to cover these specializations.&#13;

Tendering the technical assistance package needs to take place before Loan&#13;
Effectiveness date.&#13;
(ii)    Organization/Apiplication Software Implementation. Technical assistance for&#13;
improving basic functions of the NSSI, e.g., collections, benefits payments,&#13;
audit and compliance, and for financial management of the NSSI, will be&#13;
financed by the Bank through one major technical assistance procurement&#13;
encompassing planning, implementation and training. The timing of the&#13;
services will be phased over the first three years of the project, with technical&#13;
assistance on key changes in NSSI procedures on collections, payments, audit&#13;
and compliance, financial management, and general system design and master&#13;
plan, coming first. The financial management software package will be put in&#13;
place in year 1, and the customer service package in year 4. Software&#13;
development for Central Register, Collections, Payments, Short Term Benefits&#13;
and Pensions will be concentrated in year 2. Staff training will be initiated&#13;
through training of the trainers in the first half of year one, followed by local&#13;
trainers doing broader training of both Headquarters and regional office staff.&#13;
(iii)   Computer System Equipment. Establishment of the integrated information&#13;
system will involve one large equipment procurement, mostly under ICB&#13;
procedures. Bidding documents for this procurement need to be drafted&#13;
before the Loan Effectiveness date, with delivery of the first lot of equipment&#13;
- central system equipment - scheduled for the second quarter of year 1. The&#13;
second lot is scheduled to be delivered at the end of year 2, and will consist of&#13;
regional systems equipment. The third lot - year 3 - will be for the 400&#13;
auditors' laptop computers. Training of staff in use of the new equipment will&#13;
be carried out by a technical expert under the overall equipment contract. The&#13;
smaller computer equipment packages, under IS procedures, will be prepared&#13;
for bidding, for the most part, around Loan Effectiveness. This would&#13;
include computer workstations for senior level managers and the initial 60&#13;
auditors' laptops. For reference, a technical description of the information&#13;
system can be found in Appendix 5.&#13;
(iv)   Voice and Data Communication. Design and installation of the new voice and&#13;
data communication system in Headquarters and all regional offices will&#13;
involve one large equipment procurement, under ICB procedures. Bidding&#13;
documents for this procurement need to be drafted before the Loan&#13;
Effectiveness date, with delivery of equipment scheduled beginning in the&#13;
third quarter of year one. Technical assistance for design of this activity will&#13;
be procured independently through short-listing, around Loan Effectiveness&#13;
date. Training of staff in use of the new equipment will be carried out by a&#13;
technical expert under the overall equipment contract.&#13;
(v)    Security and Access Control. Technical assistance for development of a&#13;
security policy and administrative handbook will begin in year 1, with&#13;
computer equipment and related accessories and materials for the Central&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Security Unit and Regional Security Units being procured during year 2.&#13;
(vi)   NSSI Offices Upgrading. Bid process for basic rehabilitation work to upgrade&#13;
regional offices and Headquarters for introduction of the automation and&#13;
communications systems will commence around the time of Loan&#13;
Effectiveness. The rehabilitation will be the responsibility of the Facilities&#13;
and Supplies Division of the NSSI Resources Department, will be carried out&#13;
through local competitive bidding procedures, and will most likely involve a&#13;
series of small contracts, not expected to exceed US$15,000/regional office&#13;
and US$80,000 for Headquarters. Provision of computer workstations and&#13;
accessories for the Governor's Office, and the offices of Department Heads,&#13;
NSSI Headquarters, will be initiated prior to Loan Effectiveness.&#13;
(b)    Strengthening Institutional Capacity&#13;
(i)    Actuarial Analysis and Data Base Development. The Statistics and Actuarial&#13;
Division will be expanded in scope and resources, and the staff will increase&#13;
by four to a total of seven. Technical assistance will be provided initially to&#13;
support development of a unified plan with mission statement, position&#13;
descriptions, the enumeration of procedures, a comprehensive staff training&#13;
plan, and reports and activities that would be undertaken on a regular basis.&#13;
Before Loan Effectiveness, office equipment needs will be fully evaluated, and&#13;
a two part plan prepared for equipment purchases. The first part of the plan&#13;
will support immediate equipment needs, and the second will ensure efficient&#13;
interface with the new system developed under Component 1. Staff training&#13;
will be initiated around Loan Effectiveness, and will be provided periodically&#13;
throughout the project life to ensure that the division can effectively use the&#13;
new equipment and software programs.&#13;
(ii)    Policy Evaluation and Analysis. Prior to Project Effectiveness, the Policy&#13;
Analysis and Planning Division will be fully staffed with seven professionals.&#13;
Technical assistance will be provided in the initial stages to support&#13;
development of a complete mission statement and position descriptions,&#13;
development of program activities, including reports and special studies to be&#13;
undertaken on a regular basis, and a comprehensive staff training program.&#13;
Before Loan Effectiveness, office equipment needs will be fully evaluated, and&#13;
a plan will be prepared for their purchase. Staff training, including study&#13;
tours and training for NSSI policy analysts in Bulgaria and abroad, will be&#13;
initiated around Loan Effectiveness, and will be provided periodically&#13;
throughout the project life. Linkages will be established with local and&#13;
foreign universities and research institutes. Data from other Governmental&#13;
and nongovernmental sources will be needed as the basis for development of&#13;
ongoing and specialized studies. These data sources need to be identified, and&#13;
computerized data bases established for the use of the new Policy Office. On-&#13;
line services and a library need to be developed to provide sufficient&#13;
information resources for the division's staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 12 of 31&#13;
(iii)   Public Affairs. Appointment of six staff to the newly established Public&#13;
Relations Division is the first task to be accomplished. It is expected that&#13;
requisite staff will be in place prior to Loan Effectiveness, at the latest. The&#13;
next priority will be to define the program and activities of the division, and&#13;
to get these operational. Provided requisite staff have been appointed, staff&#13;
training will be initiated in the third quarter of 1996, consisting of a study&#13;
tour for senior staff, a seminar and training in use of media. Following&#13;
immediately on the above, training in running of public affairs operations will&#13;
take place. All this training should be carried out before Loan Effectiveness.&#13;
Shortly after the project start-up, the three public relations campaigns,&#13;
focussing on the new agency and legislation, as well as the new automated&#13;
workers card - AWACS - will be launched. A long-term study tour (train the&#13;
trainers) for the staff will commence in the second year of the project, and&#13;
would ideally involve staff who have worked on the design and development&#13;
of one of the public relations campaigns. The program of continuing&#13;
education will span the last three years of the project, with staff selected on&#13;
the basis of defined skills needs.&#13;
(iv)   Resource Management. The newly established Administration and Personnel&#13;
Management Department, consisting of three divisions - Personnel&#13;
Management, Project Management, and Administration - will be staffed and&#13;
provided with sufficient office facilities. The first task to be carried out is a&#13;
complete inventory of NSSI staff, equipment, and facilities, in order to&#13;
provide the basis for effective planning for the Institute. The main focus of&#13;
project resources in this subcomponent will be the Personnel Management&#13;
Division. Selection process for technical assistance to support development of&#13;
the personnel and training functions will be initiated around project start-up.&#13;
This technical assistance will support development of capacity in personnel&#13;
planning, job definition and grading, personnel selection, evaluation and&#13;
promotion, career development, and personnel administration. In addition,&#13;
the Personnel Management Division will be responsible for preparation and&#13;
carrying out of training programs for the NSSI, and will play a significant&#13;
role in management and staff training early in the project, as well as&#13;
supporting the Information Technology Department in its task of training staff&#13;
in new procedures and information system. The first training courses&#13;
supported by this department will involve management training - senior&#13;
managers from Headquarters, as well as Regional Directors of NSSI offices.&#13;
These courses will be initiated early in the first year of the project, with&#13;
annual follow-up courses. In addition, there will be one-day regional staff&#13;
meetings in years one and three of the project, to familiarize staff on the&#13;
changes in the NSSI policies and programs.&#13;

F. Project Operational Manual&#13;
15.          Each implementing technical department/unit will ensure that its respective project&#13;
activities are carried out in accordance with agreed project objectives and performance targets. A&#13;
Project Operational Manual (POM) is being compiled by the PCU from documents developed during&#13;
project preparation and appraisal, using the PIP as the basis. The POM will be subject to prior&#13;
review and approval by the Bank. The POM will constitute the implementation guidelines for each&#13;
component, and will include detailed TORs for consulting services, base implementation schedules&#13;
and procedures, performance targets and monitoring indicators, detailed cost estimates, and technical&#13;
background as appropriate. Specific tasks assigned in the POM for which the implementing&#13;
departments/units will typically be responsible include:&#13;
(a)   in collaboration with the PCU: (i) finalizing TORs for the specialist services,&#13;
feasibility studies, and training required in their respective parts of the Project; (ii)&#13;
assigning bid evaluation committees; (iii) evaluating proposals received for consulting&#13;
services; and (iv) authorizing the award of contracts;&#13;
(b)    monitoring the implementation of local training and seminars; and identifying and&#13;
tapping local expertise to assist in activities such as preparation of detailed procedures&#13;
and updating implementation schedules;&#13;
(c)    preparing periodic reports on the implementation progress of their respective&#13;
components and submitting these to the PCU for inclusion in the semi-annual report&#13;
of project performance; and&#13;
(d)    preparing physical and financial forecasts of future activities required to implement the&#13;
components of the Project, and forwarding these estimates to the PCU for inclusion in&#13;
budgetary proposals for the succeeding implementation year.&#13;
MII. PROJECT COSTS. FINANCING. REPORTING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
16.          Summary of Project Costs. The total cost of the Social Insurance Administration&#13;

2' Incremental recurrent costs are due primarily to operational and maintenance costs of comiputer equipment and&#13;
vehicles for the social insurance offices.  Incremental staff costs will be minimal.  Averaged over four yanm, the&#13;
yearly requirement represents less than one percent of the projected 1996 total Government budget for the scial&#13;
insurance sector and is deemed sustainable.&#13;

18.           Bases of Cost Estimates.  Project costs were estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)    Base Costs. Base and unit cost estimates are derived from: (a) costs of consultant&#13;
services, fellowships and training based on the rates currently charged by local,&#13;
European and North American consultants and training programs; (b) recent&#13;
quotations obtained from suppliers of computer equipment; (c) applications software&#13;
costs from comparisons with ongoing software development activities and estimated&#13;
requirements for technical books and journals; (d) building and refurbishment costs&#13;
from consultants' surveys of the current costs for these items; (e) funds allocated for&#13;
the preparation of studies, estimated on the basis of the aggregated costs of local and&#13;
foreign specialized services, unit costs for internal travel and subsistence, and mission&#13;
estimates of material and logistic needs; (f) staff-unit costs from current public service&#13;
salary scales with some adjustments for the remuneration of local technical staff to a&#13;
level deemed competitive with the market for specialized services; and (g) non-salary&#13;
recurrent costs (materials and supplies) based on current Government rates. All&#13;
project costs have been estimated in US dollars on the basis of February 1996 prices&#13;
at the official exchange rate of 72 BGL per US dollar.&#13;
(b)    Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency for unforeseen physical&#13;
variations (US$2.4 million) equivalent to 5 percent of the base cost of technical&#13;
assistance, training and fellowships and 10 percent for all other project items. The&#13;
following rates were used to cover expected price escalation: local costs 40, 40, 40,&#13;
30 percent for CY1997-2000; foreign costs 2.4 percent for CY1997-2000. In&#13;
estimating the price contingencies, it is assumed that any differentials between&#13;
domestic and international inflation rates will be offset by appropriate adjustments in&#13;
exchange rates.&#13;
(c)    Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is estimated at&#13;
about US$22.5 million, including contingencies, or 70 percent of total project cost.&#13;
Calculations of the foreign exchange component were derived from an item-by-item&#13;
analysis resulting in the following: 98 percent for office equipment, computer&#13;
hardware and software, books and journals; 30 percent for civil works; 95 percent for&#13;
foreign technical assistance; and 100 percent for external training. The foreign&#13;
exchange component in incremental recurrent expenditure was estimated at 35 percent&#13;
for the operation and maintenance of computer hardware and software; 35 percent for&#13;
other equipment maintenance; and 25 percent for supplies and operations.&#13;
(d)    Customs. Duties and Taxes. With the exception of technical assistance and training&#13;
contracts, works and goods required under the Project will not be exempt from&#13;
payment of customs duties and local taxes. The NSSI will ensure that local resources&#13;
for the payment of import duties and taxes on goods and works to be purchased under&#13;
the Project are available when needed. Project costs include an estimated US$2.9&#13;
million equivalent in direct and indirect taxes and duties to be financed by the&#13;
Govermnent.&#13;

19.             Incremental Recurrent Costs. Included in the Project are about US$5.1 million to&#13;
cover incremental operating costs directly attributable to the Project during the four-year period.&#13;
These consist of incremental operation and maintenance expenditure for equipment, and supplies and&#13;
operations. During implementation, NSSI will pay extra attention to monitoring the adequacy of&#13;
recurrent funds for maintenance and operation of facilities and newly instituted programs, and take the&#13;
necessary actions to rectify any deficiencies.&#13;
B. Project Financing&#13;
20.             The proposed Bank loan of US$24.3 million will finance 75 percent of total project&#13;
costs, comprising 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost (US$22.5 million) and 26 percent of the&#13;
local cost, excluding taxes (US$1.8 million). Co-financing is being sought to cover technical&#13;
assistance and training costs for Component 2 (actuarial development, policy planning, public affairs,&#13;
and project management). Possible donors include EU PHARE, USAID, and UK Know-How Fund.&#13;
The Government will finance the balance of project costs (US$8.0 million), including duties and&#13;
taxes. Incremental operating costs comprising equipment maintenance services and annual&#13;
maintenance costs of computers and software (US$5.1 million equivalent), will be financed entirely by&#13;
the Government. Averaged over the project life, the Government portion of recurrent expenditures&#13;
represents less than one percent of the projected 1996 operating budget for the NSSI. In addition, a&#13;
PHRD Grant financed by the Government of Japan, and a portion of the on-going Technical&#13;
Assistance Loan (No. 3384-BU) - approximately US$400,000 - are being used to support project&#13;
preparation. The NSSI has requested and the Bank has agreed to retroactive financing of up to&#13;
US$2.4 million equivalent to facilitate advance purchase of goods, works and services needed for&#13;
project start-up activities, available as of July 1, 1996.&#13;

22.              The Bank Loan of US$24.3 million will be made to the Govermnent of Bulgaria. The&#13;
Government will enter into a subsidiary Loan Agreement with the NSSI (signing of the subsidiary&#13;
Loan Agreement will be a condition of effectiveness.) On-lending terms to NSSI will be the sarm as&#13;
the terms of the Bank's loan to the Government. NSSI will provide counterpart finding of about&#13;
US$8.0 million from its own revenues. NSSI will be responsible for servicing the Loan to the&#13;
Government.&#13;
D. Project Procurement Arrangements&#13;
23.              Project procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5 below. It is envisaged&#13;
that the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents of January 1995 conforming to the latest issue of the&#13;
Procurement Guidelines will be used for the procurement of Bank-financed works, goods and related&#13;
services. The General Procurement Notice (GPN) for the project was issued after negotiations in July&#13;
1996. A project launch workshop is planned for January 1997. Incremental recurrent expenditures,&#13;
which are financed entirely with Government counterpart funds, as well as technical assistance and&#13;
training financed by other donors are shown under the N.B.F. (Non-Bank Financed) column.&#13;
Procurement procedures under the Project are as follows:&#13;

24.             Procurement through ICB. Communications, computer, and other equipment&#13;
contracts which are estimated to cost more than US$300,000 equivalent per contract will be procured&#13;
following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
'Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995 amended in&#13;
January 1996). Computers, other equipment and vehicles procured through ICB will account for&#13;
about 72 percent (US$13.3 million) of the total equipment value. In the comparison of bids for&#13;
equipment to be procured through ICB, local manufacturers competing under ICB would receive a&#13;
preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or the prevailing custom duty applicable to&#13;
non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided they can establish to the satisfaction of the&#13;
purchaser and the World Bank that: (i) labor, raw material and components from within Bulgaria will&#13;
account for more than 30 percent of the EXW price of the product offered, and (ii) the production&#13;
facility in which those goods will be manufactured or assembled has been engaged in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -                          Annex 5&#13;

manufacturing/assembling of such goods at least since the time of bid submission. A detailed list of&#13;
equipment is found in Appendix 2. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Goods and for&#13;
Computers, customized for the Project, will be used for procurement of goods and equipment,&#13;
including computer-related items.&#13;
25.          Other Forrs of Procurement. The remaining 28 percent of the project requirements&#13;
value will be in packages Oisted below) suitable for procurement other than ICB (see Table 6 for&#13;
listing of all equipment packages).&#13;
(a)   International Shopping (IS). Procedures for IS will be used for small amounts of&#13;
equipment (i.e., a first batch of computer equipment, laptops, audio visuals, and&#13;
office equipment) where the cost of ICB would clearly outweigh possible price&#13;
advantages. Contracts for equipment estimated to cost less than US$300,000 per&#13;
contract, not to exceed an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million equivalent, will be&#13;
awarded under international shopping procedures, based on comparing price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three suppliers from two eligible countries in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
(b)    National Shooing (NS). Minor sundry items not exceeding US$50,000 per contract,&#13;
up to an aggregate amount of US$600,000 equivalent, could be purchased on the basis&#13;
of prudent local shopping by comparing price quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
local suppliers, in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
(c)    Limited International Bidding (LIB). Computer application software which the Bank&#13;
agrees are available only from a limited number of suppliers may be procured through&#13;
LIB. The estimated cost of such items to be procured through LIB is about US$3.5&#13;
million in the aggregate.&#13;
(d)    Civil Works. Civil works contracts include the rehabilitation and upgrading of the 28&#13;
regional offices and Headquarters building to accommodate the computer equipment&#13;
coming in under the Project. Contracts for this rehabilitation are dispersed and of&#13;
small value, with contracts for regional offices estimated to range between US$10,000&#13;
and US$20,000. Rehabilitation of Headquarters is estimated at US$80,000.&#13;
Aggregate for civil works is estimated at about US$0.7 million. It is not feasible to&#13;
create large enough packages for these contracts to attract foreign bidders, so these&#13;
contracts would be procured using lump sum, fixed price contracts, awarded on the&#13;
basis of written quotations obtained from three or more qualified domestic contractors,&#13;
and using Bank's sample contract documentation for small works.&#13;

26.           Technical Assistance. Qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals for&#13;
comprehensive packages of consultant services and management of fellowships and training in&#13;
accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). To keep the evaluation process manageable, no&#13;
more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited following a short listing acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. It is estimated that technical assistance will be procured in eleven packages at a total cost of&#13;
US$7.9 million.3' Several of these packages will include management of related training. As needed,&#13;
the services of individual specialists (mainly for management advice, specialized consulting and&#13;
quality assurance) will also be contracted on the basis of short lists of eligible candidates. It is&#13;
anticipated that about US$0.3 million of the aggregate for technical assistance would be for individual&#13;
specialists, and approximately US$7.6 million would be for firms. Table 7 shows procurement&#13;
packages for technical assistance and training.&#13;
27.          In compliance with Bank procedures, standard model bidding documents will be used&#13;
for all ICB procurement. The Bank will continue to review master lists of equipment, packaging of&#13;
bids and updated cost estimates. With respect to each contract for goods estimated to cost the&#13;
equivalent of US$300,000 or more and all LIB contracts, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and&#13;
3 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines shall apply. It is estimated that this prior review will cover about&#13;
80 percent of the value of all contracts combined for equipment and technical assistance. The&#13;
remaining 20 percent of contracts will be subject to selective post award reviews by the Bank. The&#13;
Bank will review: (i) terms of reference for all consulting assignments; and (ii) consulting contracts&#13;
above US$100,000 with firms and above US$50,000 with individual consultants. Progress of&#13;
procurement activities will be monitored by the implementing agency, and periodic reports on&#13;
procurement progress, including variations in schedule, will be reported to the Bank on a regular&#13;
basis. A matrix with basic information on responsibilities for key steps in procurement and reporting&#13;
during implementation can be found in Appendix 6.&#13;
3/ Terms of Reference for major technical assistance packages can be found in Appendix 4.&#13;

E. Disbursements&#13;
28.          The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of four and a half&#13;
years. Given the fact that this project is one of the first Bank-financed projects in the human resource&#13;
sector, the country disbursement profile is speculative. The Project has been designed within the&#13;
capacity of the NSSI to execute over a four and a half year period, and loan funds are expected to be&#13;
fully disbursed by the end of that period. The project closing date is June 30, 2001. A summary of&#13;
the disbursement plan is shown in Table 9.&#13;
Table 8: DISBURSEMENTS BY YEAR&#13;

29.          The Government will finance expenditures for incremental recurrent costs.&#13;
Disbursements against expenditure on all other items will be made at the following rates:&#13;
(a)   for civil works, 85 percent of expenditures;&#13;
(b)   for equipment and vehicles, 100 percent of foreign expenditures; 100 percent of local&#13;
expenditures (ex-factory cost); and 80 percent of local expenditures for other items&#13;
procured locally; and&#13;
(c)   for technical assistance, fellowships and study tours, and local training, 100 percent of&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
30.          All disbursements against contracts for goods and works exceeding US$300,000&#13;
equivalent, and services and training exceeding US$100,000 equivalent for consulting firms and&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultants will be fully documented. For expenditures below&#13;
those levels, disbursements will be made on the basis of certified Statements of Expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
This documentation will be made available for the required audit as well as to Bank supervision&#13;
missions, and will be retained by the PIO for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit&#13;
report for the year in which the last disbursement was made.&#13;
31.          Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government will&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account&#13;
denominated in US dollars. The authorized allocation will be US$2.0 million. However, during the&#13;
initial stage of the Project, an amount limited to US$0.5 million will be deposited. When the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -                          Annex S&#13;
Page 24 of 31&#13;
aggregate amount of disbursement reaches US$5.0 million, the amount deposited in the Special&#13;
Account will be increased to the full authorized allocation of US$2.0 million.&#13;
32.          Project Account and Audits. Separate project accounts would be maintained by the&#13;
PCU. The project accounts, including the PCU accounts and the Special Account, would be audited&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed&#13;
by the World Bank' (March 1982). The Borrower will provide the Bank (within six months of the&#13;
end of each fiscal year), an audit report of such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably&#13;
request, including a separate opinion by an Independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, on&#13;
disbursements against certified statements of expenses (SOEs). The separate opinion should&#13;
mention whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal&#13;
controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal&#13;
applications.&#13;
F. Interagency Coordination&#13;
33.          The successful implementation of the Project will depend on good coordination among&#13;
several different agencies in the public and the private sector. Component I will require close&#13;
cooperation between the selected supplying firm(s) and central and local offices of NSSI.&#13;
G. Role of the World Bank In Supervision&#13;
34.          The Project will, on average, require about 25 staff-weeks of Bank supervision per&#13;
year on average during implementation, as reflected in the proposed supervision plan below:&#13;

H. Administrative Arrangements&#13;
35.           The Project Coordinator, with support from the Project Manager, will be responsible&#13;
for carrying out all necessary administrative arrangements recommended and approved by the Project&#13;
Advisory Group. Full-time attention of the relevant senior officers will be required in development&#13;
and implementation of the new administrative systems.&#13;
I. Implementation Schedule&#13;
36.          The Project is expected to be completed within a four year implementation period&#13;
beginning January 1997. The Project Completion Date is December 31, 2000. Negotiations were&#13;
successfully completed in June 1996. Project preparation activities have been in progress since the&#13;
beginning of 1996. The TORs for major technical assistance assignments have been drafted, vehicle&#13;
and equipment lists for project institutions have been drawn up, and bidding documents for major&#13;
procurement packages are being put together. Appendix 3 includes the detailed schedule of&#13;
implementation by activity for each sub-component. The schedule takes into account the work to be&#13;
carried out during project preparation and reflects the detailed implementation activities. Based on the&#13;
&#13;

quality of the work already completed, it is planned that the implementation of project activities will&#13;
start prior to Project Effectiveness.&#13;
IV. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
A. Development Indicators&#13;
37.          Tracking key monitoring indicators is necessary to measure the impact of the project&#13;
inputs on the major development objectives of the project. Given the essential role program&#13;
monitoring and evaluation play in determining the impact of a given intervention on development&#13;
objectives, three sets of indicators will be used to monitor and evaluate progress during&#13;
implementation of the Social Insurance Administration Project - input, output and outcome indicators.&#13;
Monitoring is a continual process of assessing whether project resources (inputs) are being used&#13;
according to plan to carry out project activities (outputs). Monitoring the use of project resources&#13;
will be done by tracking input indicators according to component, activity and expenditure category,&#13;
as outlined in Table 9 below. Monitoring output indicators under the project involves tracking&#13;
implementation of project activities, as outlined in Table 10 below. Updated input and output&#13;
indicator information, using the formats provided in the tables below, will be included in the project's&#13;
semi-annual Progress Reports, to be prepared by the PCU.&#13;
38.          Outcome indicators will track whether or not the development objectives of the&#13;
Project have been met. Two criteria were used to select the basic outcome indicators: (a) that the&#13;
indicator is known to be sensitive to the intervention introduced under the Project; and (b) that data&#13;
will be readily available through routine administrative collection. NSSI will continue tracking of&#13;
indicators beyond the life of the Project as one aspect of overall monitoring of the social security&#13;
sector. Outcome indicators by subcomponent are outlined in Table 11 below.&#13;
B. Indicator Tables&#13;
39.          Tables 9, 10 and 11 below provide basic formats for tracking input, output and&#13;
outcome indicators, as described in paras. 37 and 38 above.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA&#13;
SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPERT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION OF A PENSION REGISTRATION SYSTEM&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           The Republic of Bulgaria has applied for a loan of approximately US$25 million from&#13;
the World Bank to help finance the costs of the Social Insurance Administration Project consisting of&#13;
the following two components: (a) Improving Operation and Administrative Efficiency; and&#13;
(b) Strengthening Institutional Capacity.&#13;
2.           A key objective of the project is to establish a comprehensive Social Insurance&#13;
Information System (SIIS) to support the operational activities of the Social Insurance Administration&#13;
(the Institute). A key step in the development of such a system would be the creation of a central&#13;
registry of information on employers, employees, self-employed individuals and pensioners. This key&#13;
step will be taken with the utmost urgency so that the SIIS can be fully utilized soon after the system&#13;
development is completed and automation equipment is made available to the Institute. In support of&#13;
this activity, the Institute plans to start collecting and storing on data bases registry data on employees&#13;
from all public and private sector enterprises in early 1997. It is anticipated that this will include key&#13;
biographical data, wages, and contributions for all employees. The Institute already has basic data on&#13;
enterprises and self-employed individuals.&#13;
Summary of Overall Requirements&#13;
3.           This terms-of-reference covers the services of an application systems development&#13;
expert to assist the Institute and provide technical leadership to and supervision of a small dedicated&#13;
internal application development team (estimated to consist of two analysts and two programmers) to&#13;
develop the initial registration system, specify and put in place the systems development and&#13;
production computer environment for the initial registration system, lead the application systems&#13;
development activities and the preparation of training materials for this preliminary data collection,&#13;
and train the Institute trainers in preparation for dissemination of the system to all regions and to the&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
Scope of the Required Technical Assistance&#13;
4.           Based upon the above general description, the Republic of Bulgaria seeks the service&#13;
of an information technology individual consultant with broad experience in the development of&#13;
microcomputer based application systems that are rooted on: user friendly graphical interfaces (GUI);&#13;
client-server architectures; SQL standard relational data bases; and modular development based on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -                             Appendix 4&#13;
Page 2 of 17&#13;
modern system development methodologies and languages. It is estimated that this assignment will&#13;
require about six staff months over a period of about one year, with a substantial part of the time in&#13;
Sofia, Bulgaria.&#13;
5.            The target technical environment for the SIIS is a UNIX based client-server&#13;
environment with Windows based workstations supported by a relational data base system, under&#13;
UNIX, to manage data storage. The initial registration system may be based on a different&#13;
technology but the Institute requires assurance that data migration to the target environment will be&#13;
accomplished with minimum effort. In addition, it would be desirable that as many modules as&#13;
possible of the initial registration system could be directly used or, at least, re-implemented in the&#13;
target environment with minimum effort.&#13;
Deliverables&#13;
6.            The key deliverable of this consultancy is a fully functional registration system to be&#13;
developed and be placed in operation in a collaborative venture between the Information Technology&#13;
Expert and the Institute's development team. The following major deliverables are anticipated to be&#13;
the responsibility of the Consultant:&#13;
(i)    a strategic plan for the project detailing all steps from initial systems analysis to&#13;
delivery of the system in operational mode to the central office and all regions. The&#13;
plan should include the technical specifications for all software and equipment that&#13;
must be purchased to support the system development activities.&#13;
(ii)    design of forms to be used to capture: initial registration information, past wage and&#13;
contribution information, current periodic wage and contribution information. It is&#13;
expected that most data will be delivered to the institute in electronic form. Therefore&#13;
both paper and electronic collection forms need to be designed.&#13;
(iii)   technical supervision over the installation of target equipment and software&#13;
environments and assistance to the Institute on acceptance of goods delivered.&#13;
(iv)   training of development team staff in operations and technical support providing&#13;
assistance to the Institute Informatics Management in identifying in-house technical&#13;
support requirements.&#13;
(v)    fully operational computer systems for: data entry and validation (both at the institute&#13;
and to be given to public and private firms), workflow control over returns received&#13;
and returns missing, load of received data into the registration data base, and basic&#13;
reporting from the data base.1Y&#13;
It is understood that the responsibility of the consultant is limited because most of the application developmuit&#13;
activities would be undertaken by staff of the Institute. Therefore the responsibility of the Consultant is limited to&#13;
that normally attributed to a team leader.&#13;
&#13;

- 143 -                            ARpnRdix 4&#13;
Page 3 of 17&#13;
(vi)   development of a testing plan to ensure that all systems operate properly before they&#13;
are deployed to the public and to the regions.&#13;
(vii)  development of a training plan including the training activities necessary for successful&#13;
deployment of the system. Technical supervision and quality control over the&#13;
production of training materials, that will be developed in Bulgarian language,&#13;
including:&#13;
Operational Procedures Manuals. This document should contain pertinent information&#13;
which are required for use by technical staff who will be responsible for operate and&#13;
administer the system and its data bases both centrally and at the regions. At a&#13;
minimum, it should cover the following topics: hardware and software requirements;&#13;
rules for estimation of data volume; installation procedures; system back up and&#13;
recovery procedures; security management procedures; and special operating&#13;
procedures such as month-ending, year-ending, initialization, etc. It is anticipated that&#13;
there will be two separate manuals for the data-entry modules (to be distributed to the&#13;
regions and to interested enterprises) and for the central registry loading and data base&#13;
maintenance activities.&#13;
User's Manual. This document should be prepared for use by the end users inside&#13;
and outside the Institute. It should describe all available functions of the data-entry&#13;
system and how to use them. For each function, the required inputs, expected&#13;
outputs, editing rules, limitations, and error/system messages should be fully&#13;
described. The User's manual should also describe how and when the User should&#13;
interact with the Institute's technical staff, and procedures for problem resolution.&#13;
(viii) by mid-October 1996, completion of development and testing of the software and&#13;
hardware needed for the preliminary data collection required in the Pension Law and&#13;
by end of December 1996, fully operational preliminary data system in place.&#13;
(ix)   development of a user specification for the personal registration system to cover what&#13;
information is to be collected, when and to whom the information is to be supplied.&#13;
(x)   the transfer of knowledge to the Institute staff.&#13;
Reporting and Communications&#13;
7.            The information technology expert will work closely with, receive guidance from, and&#13;
give feedback to the Institute's Informatics Management. At the end of each business trip the expert&#13;
will prepare a concise report indicating progress against schedule, major issues and making&#13;
recommendations to address them. At completion, the expert will submit a project completion report&#13;
that will accompany the delivery of the software and final documentation.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA&#13;
SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
TELEPHONE TECHNOLOGY EXPERT(S) FOR TIE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
OF SPECIFICATIONS FOR WIRING, PBX AND RELATED EQUIPMENT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           The project. The Republic of Bulgaria is receiving a loan of about US$25 million&#13;
from the World Bank to help finance improvements of the country's social insurance administration in&#13;
(a) operational and administrative efficiency; and (b) institutional capacity. The organization in&#13;
charge of the project is the National Social Security Institute (the "Institute"). Most of the loan&#13;
proceeds will be used to design and implement, practically from scratch, a comprehensive Social&#13;
Insurance Information System (SIIS) at the Institute that will gather and hold vital, wage and&#13;
contribution data on employees from all the country's public and private sector enterprises. Data on&#13;
enterprises and on self-employed individuals will also be collected and processed. Under separate&#13;
Terms of Reference, a consultant will take up an assignment comprising several longer visits to the&#13;
country, to assist the Institute with the design and piloting of the SIIS.&#13;
2.           Telephone component. As part of the loan, an amount of about $2.7 million has been&#13;
estimated for investments in improved electronic communications. Mostly this would constitute the&#13;
rewiring of the Institute's buildings, and the installation of Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs), and of&#13;
telephone sets, while a lesser fraction of the funds is earmarked for data communication equipment&#13;
and design/engineering work. The Institute comprises a headquarters (in Sofia) and 28 regional&#13;
offices, for a total of about 2,500 staff. As a rough approximation, about 500 staff work at&#13;
headquarters, and 50 to 100 in each regional office. The expectation is that the investment will&#13;
provide a PBX for each site and implement a total of 1,000 or more individual telephone&#13;
extensions/stations. Future expansion to the full complement of one station per employee (plus extra&#13;
needs) should be as straightforward as can prudently be prepared for now. The Institute's buildings&#13;
typically date from 1970, more or less.&#13;
3.           Commercial and regulatory environment. Since 1988/89, telecommunications in&#13;
Bulgaria has been largely deregulated, and private businesses are allowed to install telephone wires as&#13;
well as PBXs and telephone sets. Wires have to conform to certain specifications, and equipment has&#13;
to be approved for use in Bulgaria, under standards and procedures which have been set by a&#13;
governmental commission. A number of private businesses have sprouted serving the sector.&#13;
International firms are represented among them. The telecommunications branch of the former PT&amp;T&#13;
monopoly operates as one of the commercial players (though it currently remains fully state-owned).&#13;
Legislation towards further liberalization of the telecommunications sector is under active&#13;
consideration.&#13;
&#13;

Page 15 of 17&#13;
Summary of Overall Requirements and Delivarable&#13;
4.            These Terms of Reference cover the services of one or two experts in electronic&#13;
communications to assist the Institute in developing technical specifications for a procurement to be&#13;
conducted under World Bank International Competitive Bidding ([CB) rules. The procurement would&#13;
address, if feasible in one package, the cost-effective wiring of all offices of the Institute for voice&#13;
and data, the supply and installation of PBXs and telephone sets at headquarters and in each regional&#13;
office, and data communications interfaces and equipment to the extent indicated from progress in the&#13;
computerization part of the project. As deliverables, the consultant(s) would produce drafts of the&#13;
Technical Specifications and the Schedule of Requirements sections, provide comments on&#13;
implications, if any, on the other sections (such as Instructions to Bidders, General and Special&#13;
Conditions of Contract) of the standard bidding documents, and advise the Institute on management&#13;
and operation of the investment. The consultant(s) are expected to cover the areas detailed in the&#13;
following section ("Scope of Work") and take into account any other aspects that they deem to have a&#13;
bearing on the task.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
5.            Confirm user requirements. This would be achieved primarily through discussions&#13;
with project counterparts at the Institute. The list of requirements to be developed would need to be&#13;
mindful of the loan funds available for the procurement, while achieving a maximum of utility for the&#13;
typical conduct of Institute business (by, e.g., allowing extensions/stations to be shared within&#13;
workgroups). PBX functionality, interface types and capacities between PBXs and central telephone&#13;
offices (e.g., trunk lines), and any Institute-wide telephone interfaces, would all need to be discussed&#13;
and defined. The potential expediency of PBX alternatives such as electronic key systems for small&#13;
offices and/or Centrex-type arrangements should be judged. The data communications requirements&#13;
will also need to be ascertained, to the extent possible by progress in the computerization track of the&#13;
project. For this, the consultant(s) should interact with the SIIS consultant as feasible. It is expected&#13;
that office wiring and PBX will support the (future) implementation of data communications.&#13;
6.            Establish standards and market situation. The consultant(s) would gather the&#13;
required facts and details on Bulgarian standards and regulations - if necessary in translations - for the&#13;
telephone and data wiring of buildings, the approval status and availability of brands of PBX,&#13;
telephone set and data communications equipment, the functions and features offered by the public&#13;
telephone service, and prospective regulatory developments. They would obtain an adequate picture&#13;
of the market situation -- including an idea of the domestic and foreign firms/corporations already&#13;
active in the Bulgarian market and capable of meeting the project's requirements, public services&#13;
available or planned for wide-area communications with potential usefulness for the project such as&#13;
ISDN, X.25 and frame relay networks, and prices that can reasonably be expected. The consultant(s)&#13;
will share these findings with the Institute to improve the likelihood of eliciting a solid response to the&#13;
ICB.&#13;
7.            Ascertain the physical environment. From blueprints of the buildings as may be&#13;
available at the Institute or at the state organization with (previous) responsibility for the construction&#13;
of government property, and/or through site visits, if necessary of all 29 premises of the Institute, the&#13;
consultant(s) are expected to obtain all the required information for producing physical descriptions of&#13;
the Institute's buildings satisfactory for bidders' understanding of the wiring and installation effort.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -                           Appendix 4&#13;
Page 16 of 17&#13;
The consultant(s) would determine any need for the Institute to add photographs and/or outlines of&#13;
floor plans to the descriptions, and advise on any requirements for physical modifications in buildings&#13;
which the Institute would need to prepare for this procurement. This is a crucial aspect of the&#13;
assignment, since it would not be practical or economical to anticipate bidders to inspect more than a&#13;
few of the 29 premises of the Institute. The description of requirements for each building should take&#13;
into account plans, if any, that exist about renovations and/or replacements to ensure expedient wiring&#13;
and installation approaches. Further, although reuse of installed wires is not expected to be a&#13;
practical option, this aspect should also be probed.&#13;
8.            Draft Technical Specifications and provide related advice. Based on the&#13;
information obtained and own judgment, the consultant(s) will discuss with the Institute feasible&#13;
approaches that would meet requirements, and their funding and other implications. They would then&#13;
draft the Technical Specifications and the Schedule of Requirements (including the requirements for&#13;
installation, acceptance, manuals, and training) for inclusion in the bidding documents, and advise on&#13;
other parts of the latter such as feasible delivery schedules, warranty and spare part provisions, merit&#13;
evaluation aspects (if any), and any need for stipulating post-qualification of the lowest evaluated&#13;
bidder. To this end, the consultant(s) will perform a walkthrough with the Institute of the variable&#13;
parts of the World Bank's standard bidding documents and suggest appropriate markups. They will&#13;
also specifically advise on (a) whether and how to package the procurement into several lots (the&#13;
preference being one lot only); (b) which parts of the overall requirements, e.g., in data&#13;
communications, should rather be deferred to a future procurement; and (c) specify any extra and&#13;
separate design or planning work if a case can be identified for such work. Equally importantly, the&#13;
consultant(s) will advise the Institute on the management and organizational provisions that will need&#13;
to be in place for the implementation and operation of the new telephone system.&#13;
Timing and Level of Effort&#13;
9.            The consultant(s) should perform and complete the assignment between August and&#13;
October, 1996.9' Unless the consultants are resident, the bulk of the information gathering would take&#13;
place through a mission to Bulgaria of about three weeks duration. The stay would need to be&#13;
extended by about a week, if it were found that all 29 sites of the Institute require a personal visit.&#13;
Technical Specifications and Schedule of Requirements would need to be drafted during the visit in a&#13;
form that is comprehensive enough to be discussed with the Institute before departure. The drafts and&#13;
other inputs could be completed after the mission. The total effort, including travel times, is&#13;
estimated to take 9 staffweeks (or 45 workdays, by one, or distributed over two, experts).&#13;
Qualifications&#13;
10.          The consultant(s) should have a track record in the planning, design, and management&#13;
of private branch telephone systems, including building wiring, PBX technology, and the interface&#13;
requirements to trunk lines and central offices. They should be familiar with relevant industry&#13;
standards such as EIA/TIA 568, IEEE 802, X.25/frame relay, ISDN and T/E-series. Their expertise&#13;
must include practical up-to-date knowledge of data communications, specifically local area&#13;
V Tentative plans are for the bidding, evaluation, and contract award to complete by April 1997, and for&#13;
delivery and installation of all wiring and equipment to occur between May 1997 and March 1998.&#13;

networking using twisted pair/central wiring closets and the wiring requirements of servers (multi-user&#13;
computers). If the assignment is performed by two consultants, it is expected that one of the two&#13;
would be a resident with in-depth knowledge of the Bulgarian telephony market, regulations, and&#13;
other practical considerations.&#13;

SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
SYSTEM TECHNICAL DESCRIPHION11&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.           During the World Bank mission to Bulgaria in December 1995, a report was prepared&#13;
describing the design of a new information system for the Social Insurance Institute (ref. "Social&#13;
Insurance Reform in Bulgaria: Improvement of Operations", December 1995).&#13;
2.           In February 1996, during a new visit to the Social Insurance National Institute in&#13;
Sofia, an alternative solution for the Social Insurance Information System has been outlined, based on&#13;
further discussions and new requirements for system flexibility and expandability.&#13;
B. UNIX System Architecture&#13;
3.           The new solution is UNIX based. In this scenario, the central system is a UNIX&#13;
system according to the standard XPG4 (X/OPEN Portability Guide v.4). The national data base is&#13;
located in the central office, where also the system administration and system security are defined and&#13;
managed.&#13;
4.           The regional offices are equipped with UNIX processing capacity and a subset of&#13;
replicated data for routine operations. Only the updated data are transferred on-line to the central&#13;
data base, while periodically (daily, weekly, etc.) all data transfer will is made in batch mode.&#13;
5.           This allows a great reduction in communication lines costs, as they are tremendously&#13;
high at present to allow a completely on-line system (and the public X.25 network does not work&#13;
efficiently). It also reduces NSSI operational dependency on the quality of the Bulgarian country-&#13;
wide communications network that has not yet achieved acceptable levels of reliability.&#13;
6.           The UNIX system allows future adjustments, in case the telecommunication costs will&#13;
go down, as the system design is flexible enough to consider such changes. Adjustments are to be&#13;
effected by central decision to augment or reduce the amount of operational information from the&#13;
central data-bases that will be replicated in the regional office data bases.&#13;
7.           The two layers will communicate either in real time or in batch mode, during an&#13;

initial phase, using cheaper phone lines, due to the present expensiveness and low quality of public&#13;
and private X.25 network.&#13;
8.            Unlike the mainframe solution (detailed in the document referred to above), a period&#13;
of transition during which the old and the new systems will coexist does not seem cost effective&#13;
although feasible from a technical viewpoint. New systems will be developed in the new UNIX&#13;
environment using modem high-level programming languages. Existing IBMNVM based application&#13;
systems will be migrated to the new environment at a pace determined by the NSSI. Existing&#13;
application systems and data will transition through a parallel run phase that shall for as long as&#13;
necessary to ensure the correctness of the newly developed application system.&#13;
9.            The data-bases, currently based on VSAM file, will be restructured using relational&#13;
data base according to SQL standard as previously described and, obtaining the same results in&#13;
security and efficiency described in the mentioned document. Also the considerations about the&#13;
cooperative and distributed processing remain valid.&#13;
10.          It is necessary to underline that the mid-range systems of the identified class and the&#13;
printing tools, which can be usually connected to them, are not usually able to support the current&#13;
printing environment. Therefore, the NSSI shall take advantage of the change in computing&#13;
architecture to attempt to take advantage of recent developments in printing technology.&#13;
11.          Considering that, in this architecture, it will not be cost effective to use the old IBM&#13;
systems during the operational phase, for the central system it is advisable to foresee the acquisition&#13;
of two UNIX systems. One of the two computer systems shall be used, in the operational phase, for&#13;
maintenance of application systems and for future application systems developments. This computer&#13;
system shall also provide backup for the most critical applications.&#13;
C. Transition Period to the Second Solution&#13;
12.          In case of conversion to UNIX architecture, it is not economical to consider a period&#13;
of transition in which the current applications function both on the old and new systems. UNIX&#13;
systems, to be used, need new applications specifically developed for the new architecture. The&#13;
period of transition, therefore, exclusively consists in the implementation of the new system, the new&#13;
applications and the information data base. New versions of current applications shall be run in&#13;
parallel with the current applications until the NSSI is ensured they are correct.&#13;
1.13.        A pilot-LAN will be also implemented as described in Chapter 8.3.2.3. of the&#13;
referred document. In this context the recruitment, training and retention of technical personnel&#13;
continues to be critical for the success of the project, as the personnel in the Computer Center at&#13;
present has no experience on UNIX environment.&#13;
1.14.        The new design takes advantage of the fact that the Bulgarian universities are&#13;
preparing an increasing number of UNIX experts. Moreover, other public Administration&#13;
information system are moving towards UNIX (e.g., the EGN system and the Bulgarian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Telecommunications Company). Therefore, "ad-hoc" training for system operators and system&#13;
administrators on UNIX operation system and networking (TPC/IP, X.25, SNMP for network&#13;
management) is required but may be readily available in the country. Application programmers shall&#13;
be trained to use the new programming tools in due time in order to build the new applications&#13;
needed to set up the new system. System administrators will need also training in physically setting-&#13;
up SQL data base and in production of procedures for backups and restores of logical data.&#13;
D. Technical Summary&#13;
15.          This chapter describes the UNIX solution in terms of hardware and software&#13;
architecture according to what outlined in Chapter 8.2 of the mentioned document. For costing&#13;
purposes that document made reference to HP and other proprietary products, but the loan would&#13;
procure similar products readily available from several manufacturers. It is expected that most of&#13;
these goods and services will be procured using International Competitive Bidding procedures.&#13;

MATRIX OF PROCUREMENT AND REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
1.           The following matrix seeks to clarify responsibilities for key steps in procurement and&#13;
reporting during implementation among the various players involved in the project. The following&#13;
definitions are used in the matrix:&#13;
(a)    Project Coordination Unit (PCU) refers to the unit in the NISI responsible for the&#13;
general administration of the credit and coordination of project activities. The PCU is&#13;
comprised of a project manager, project coordinator, procurement officer, accountant,&#13;
and staff assistant. The PCU may be supported by short-term consultants in specific&#13;
areas in order that it be able to more efficiently fulfill its role.&#13;
(b)    Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) refers to the technical groups established during project&#13;
preparation for each subcomponent and maintained throughout implementation to&#13;
provide technical support to the PCU.&#13;
2.           The PCU is encouraged to organize regular meetings of representatives of the AHCs,&#13;
as well as any other individuals involved in project activities both within and outside of the NISI, in&#13;
order to keep all parties up-to-date on project status and identify obstacles early on in order to seek&#13;
mutually agreeable solutions. Meetings should ideally be organized around an established agenda,&#13;
with time allotted for questions or other open discussion. The PCU Coordinator will be responsible&#13;
for keeping the Governor of the NISI informed of the outcome of these meetings, and will seek his&#13;
guidance in resolving issues if necessary.&#13;

            Bulgaria - Social Insurance Administration Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Social Insurance Administration
            Project aims to support the government's current reform
            program goals of eliminating the social insurance budgetary
            subsidy through fiscal balance achievement and laying the
            groundwork for future reforms aimed at a fundamental
            restructuring of Bulgaria's system for guaranteeing
            income security. Therefore, the project will: a) strengthen
            efforts to increase the National Social Security
            Insitute's (NSSI) overall operational efficiency in the
            emerging market economy, focusing on reversing the reduced
            tax compliance trend which is undermining the financial
            stability of the public Pay-As-You-Go social insurance
            program; and b) strengthening the NSSI to perform key policy
            formulation and evaluation functions and better manage
            available resources. The first component is increasing
            compliance and operational efficiency. This will institute
            effective operational procedures for inter alia: a) control
            and monitoring of fund flow into and out of the social
            insurance system; b) improved revenue/ expenditure
            projection and benefit calculation on an actual contribution
            basis; and c) improved services to clients, including
            efficient payment of pensions and short term benefits. The
            second major component is strengthening Institutional
            capacity by: a) policy analysis; b) actuarial forecasting;
            c) public information/ education concerning the social
            insurance program and d) personnel management including
            improvements in staff selection, incentives, training and
            career development. The project will be implemented over a
            period of four years.
