                                             1.      INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
  After almost 20 years, the conflict inCasamance inSenegal is nearing a negotiated settlement that should&#13;
  end the violence that has inflictedhundreds o f civilian deaths and injuriesuponthe Casamance population&#13;
  and generated large numbers o f displaced persons and refugees. Although this conflict was o f low&#13;
  intensity, thus allowing "business as usual" to go on in the rest o f the country, the disruption o f the&#13;
  economic and social life o f the populace posed an unsustainable constraint on the region's potential. If&#13;
  unfettered, this potential couldbringsignificant economic development to the Casamance region and, as a&#13;
  consequence, to Senegal as a whole.&#13;
  InApril2000, anewpresidenttook office asthethirdPresidentoftheRepublicofSenegal.Asaresult of&#13;
  his commitment to resolving the thorny Casamance issue, contacts for future peace negotiations started&#13;
  anew. Since then, the situation has improved significantly, culminating in the co-signing in 2001 o f two&#13;
  peace agreements by representatives o f the Movement (Mouvement des Forces Dimocratiques de la&#13;
  Casamance (MFDC)) and the Government o f Senegal (GoS). Those sketchy peace agreements briefly&#13;
  touched on such political questions as the billeting and disarmament o f armed groups, prisoner liberation&#13;
  and freedom of movement, as well as economic and social recovery issues such as mine clearance,&#13;
  reinsertion programs and improved road access.&#13;
  Inthe wake ofthose agreements, the GoSundertookthe developmentofthe Programme deRelancedes&#13;
  Activith Economiques et Sociales en Casamance (PRAESC). The program had the financial and&#13;
  technical backing o f all donors, led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the&#13;
  EuropeanUnion (EU) and the World Bank.&#13;
  The World Bank's role will be pivotal duringthe post-conflict process. Like all o f Senegal's partners, the&#13;
  World Bank i s committed to promoting the peace process within the context o f the PRAESC. This World&#13;
  Bank presence inCasamance will manifest itself intwo ways: (i)         a project specific to Casamance, Le., the&#13;
  Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Support Project (CERSP), which will finance a portion o f the&#13;
  activities described inthe PRAESC; and (ii)       some o f its ongoing projects in Senegal, which will re-direct&#13;
  some o f their resources to Casamance.&#13;
  The CERSP will be the World Bank's primary vehicle inCasamance and i s presented inthis document.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  2.1 DESCRIPTIONOF THE CONFLICT&#13;
&#13;
  Casamance, a natural region situated along the Casamance River in southwestern Senegal consists o f two&#13;
  administrative regions: Ziguinchor and Kolda, with respective areas o f 7,339 km2 and 21,011 km2.&#13;
  Casamance i s separated from the rest o f Senegal by the enclaved Republic o f The Gambia and the&#13;
 Gambia River.&#13;
 Casamance has an estimated population o f 1,341,000 inhabitants belonging to various ethnic groups -&#13;
 Diola, Fulbe (Peuls), Mandingue, Soninke, SQkre, Wolof, Toucouleur, Bambara, Manjaque, Mankagne,&#13;
PCpel, Balantes and Bairnouk - all with distinct languages or dialects.' Separatist aspirations among the&#13;
 Casamanqais date from the colonial period, during which the populace resisted French influence. The&#13;
region's geographic and political separation, resulting from the presence o f the Gambia River and the&#13;
 former British colony o f The Gambia, has preserved its separate languages and cultures but has also&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 prevented real integration with the rest o f Senegal, from which the Casamance population has remained&#13;
 somewhat aloof.&#13;
 The Casamance region has always been known for its cosmopolitan character and ethnic diversity. The&#13;
 area known as Basse Casamance, i.e., the Ziguinchor region, and Moyenne Casamance, the SCdhiou&#13;
 department in the Kolda region, whose populations are predominantly Diola, have a relatively high&#13;
 economic potential, mainly due to agriculture and tourism. The social and economic life o f the population&#13;
 revolves around the Casamance River. The population o f Haute Casamance - the area comprised o f the&#13;
 two other departments o f the Kolda region, Kolda and VClingara                   --  i s predominantly Fulbe and&#13;
 Mandingue. Poorer and with less economic potential, its physical remoteness from Dakar limits its&#13;
 development prospects.&#13;
&#13;
 Cause of the Casamance conflict&#13;
 "At root, MFDC (Mouvement des Forces De`mocratiquesde Casamance) militancy is the outgrowth o f economic&#13;
 grievances and, secondarily, cultural ones that compound Diola rejection o f the impositions o f an alien central&#13;
 government. Though the Casamance i s Senegal's main food-producing area, the CasamanGaishave felt themselves&#13;
 neglected in terms o f investment from Dakar. They lack roads and transport to get food to market. Central&#13;
 government attempts to increase rice output by non-traditional methods gave rise to cultural resentment as well as&#13;
 labor shortages, particularly among the Diola. (Rice cultivation for the Diola combines deep religious significance&#13;
 with economic subsistence and is closely fitted to the local ecology.)&#13;
 "The keenest grievance has been expropriation o f land since independence by both the State and immigrants from&#13;
 northern Senegal. A significant migration o f Muslimfarmers and petty traders to the Casamance occurred in the&#13;
 1980s, when they encroached on Diola land and destroyed forest cover in order to plant groundnuts. Though lands&#13;
 are nominally divided between Muslims and Catholics, a common Diola religious tradition uniting the Diola with&#13;
 the land, and with the forest in particular, continues to run strong. It unifies Muslimand Catholic alike against the&#13;
heterodox Muslim settlers from the north. The latter stand accused by the Diola o f pillaging the resources o f the&#13;
Casamance with the complicity o fthe authorities."&#13;

&#13;
The conflict aimed at independence for Casamance has been impeding this region's development. The&#13;
causes are complex and include historic, economic, and social factors (e.g., youth unemployment and land&#13;
tenure problems) as well as cultural issues (e.g., the failure to acknowledge local specificities). Despite its&#13;
apparent ethnic roots, the conflict i s mainly economic and political, however. As with other recent&#13;
regional conflicts, the main cause i s the marginalization o f the region within an overly centralized&#13;
country.&#13;
The separatist insurrection is straining the government's military and political capacities and paralyzing&#13;
Senegal's most fertile region. Untilrecently, this conflict was portrayed as solely a Senegalese problem.&#13;
However, ethnic and economic factors have caused clashes between Senegalese security forces and the&#13;
MFDC guerillas to affect the stability o f neighboring countries, and particularly that o f Guinea-Bissau.&#13;
Thus, the conflict has grown from a local one to a sub-regional one. Given the cultural and economic ties&#13;
existingamong The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Casamance, a peaceful resolution in Casamance would&#13;
promote regional stability.&#13;
The conflict's intensity has varied over time, with quiet (albeit tense) periods broken by sporadic&#13;
outbreaks o f violence.&#13;
Combat zones have shifted from one area to another within the region, causing population displacements&#13;
usually o f short duration. Untilrecently, Haute Casamance - i.e., the Kolda and VClingara departments -&#13;
were spared, but an increase in livestock rustling and vandalism by armed gangs that then fled to Guinea-&#13;
Bissau led to the closing o f the border with that country in September 2002. This border has since been&#13;
re-opened.&#13;

&#13;
 Peace agreements between the Government o f Senegal and the MFDC were signed on March 16 and 23,&#13;
 2001. Those sketchy peace agreements briefly touched on such political questions as the billeting and&#13;
 disarmament o f armed groups, prisoner liberation and freedom o f movement, as well as economic and&#13;
 social recovery issues such as mine clearance, reinsertionprograms, and improvedroad access.&#13;
&#13;
 2.2    CURRENT STATUS&#13;
&#13;
 Despite the progress made, low intensity violence, some criminal and some political in nature, has&#13;
 persisted in the area. Dissension within the MFDC has sometimes provoked violence. However,&#13;
 discussions within the Movement have gone on under pressure from a Casamance population exhausted&#13;
 by more than 20 years o f fruitless conflict. After some changes at the top (including the death due to&#13;
 illness o f a major past military leader), the MFDC now seems close to the unity necessary for a peace&#13;
 process.&#13;
 Contacts between both parties resumed with a high-level meeting on May 4, 2003 between the President&#13;
 o f Senegal and the political leader o f the MFDC. The MFDC convened a conference o f the Movement's&#13;
 major leaders from October 6 to 8, 2003. The conclusions o f this meeting were quite clear about the&#13;
 commitment o f MFDCrepresentatives to ending the violence and reaching a final peace agreement.&#13;
 InJanuary 2004, the Government announced significant progresstowardspeace. While no overallpeace&#13;
 accord has been signed yet, negotiations with the three separate factions have begun. The most radical&#13;
 faction has just signed an agreement that ends combat, withdraws troops to their barracks, ends road&#13;
blockades by ex-combatants and agrees to restorehehabilitate basic social infrastructure inthe area. There&#13;
have been no significant attacks in several months; indeed, the army i s feeding the rebels as an incentive&#13;
to get them to lift roadblocks, and the Government feels that the conditions for security and peace are&#13;
present. These initiatives intensified until the adoption o f Amnesty Law No. 2004.20 on July 21, 2004.&#13;
On the same occasion, the Government established the Agence Nationale de Relance des Activitks&#13;
Economiques et Sociales en Casamance (ANRAC, created by decret o f No.2004.822 o f July 2004) to&#13;
implement, among other things, the PRAESC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.3    HUMANAND SOCIAL IMPACT&#13;
&#13;
The toll of the conflict is now fairly well documented: many thousands o f lives lost, hundreds o f people&#13;
injuredby mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), and tens of thousands displaced either internally or&#13;
externally. According to the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF), which works inCasamance, the&#13;
consequences include around 30,000 displaced persons,2 231villages deserted and 4,000 school students&#13;
displaced and accommodatedintemporary housing. Land mine victims from 1988 to 1999, as reportedby&#13;
the NGO Handicap International (HI), totaled 433, including 95 deaths. Most o f these accidents occurred&#13;
inthe latter half of the 1990s. The UnitedNations HighCommission for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates&#13;
that there are 13,000 refugees inGuinea-Bissau and The Gambia.&#13;
The area most affected lies south o fZiguinchor on the border with Guinea-Bissau. MFDCapparently had&#13;
regrouped its forces and placed land mines in fields to protect them. The mines, combined with frequent&#13;
fighting, pushed civilians out o f the region toward inner Casamance and Ziguinchor city. Other parts o f&#13;
the Ziguinchor region, especially the north, have been less affected thanks to a separate peace agreement&#13;
between the GoS and the so-called `northern wing' o f the rebellion. Violence, apparently more criminal&#13;
than military in nature, has also been reported there, however. After the battles, armed gangs leave&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
* This estimate comes from the International Organization for Migrations (IOM) after a comprehensive field survey&#13;
in2001..&#13;

&#13;
 randomly placed antipersonnel mines to prevent effective pursuit. This atmosphere o f lawlessness&#13;
 increases feelings o f insecurity among the localpopulation.&#13;
 The Kolda region i s markedly less afflicted. The impact o f the conflict decreases as distance from the&#13;
 Ziguinchor region increases. Land mines have been detected only in the SCdhiou department, for&#13;
 example, while the Kolda and VClingara departments are almost untouched.&#13;
 The health system has also suffered: many health centers have shut down and the vaccination program&#13;
 (Programme klargi de vaccination, or PEV) was unable to reach its assigned objectives. Access to the&#13;
 health system i s especially difficult inthe many rural areas inwhich infrastructure has been destroyed and&#13;
 health care workers have often left. Infrastructure not destroyed has been neglected and left unattended,&#13;
 leading to theft o f eq~ipment.~Unsafe conditions and the difficulty o f free movement, especially during&#13;
 the rainy season, make access to health facilities even more problematic. Finally, displaced persons&#13;
 cannot always afford the requiredco-payment (tickets modkrateurs) or drugs, even when health facilities&#13;
 are nearby.&#13;
 The extent o f the A I D S epidemic i s not well known, for lack o f reliable data. With few health facilities&#13;
 operating, exhaustive data collection has been impossible. In the Ziguinchor department, 3,300 AIDS-&#13;
 infected persons have been identified, for a prevalence rate o f 0.90 percent. Of these, 1,500, or 45.45&#13;
percent, are females. In the Kolda department, 4,300 adults (i.e., individuals aged 15 and older) are&#13;
 infected, for a prevalence rate o f 0.80 percent. Of these, 2000, or 45.5 1percent, are females. Indramatic&#13;
contrast, the AIDS infection rate among sex-workers i s estimated to be 20 percent.&#13;
Maternal mortality in this region is alarming: the figure in Kolda i s 1,200 maternal deaths per 100,000&#13;
birthsvs. anational average o f about 510 deathsper 100,000 births.&#13;
As for the education sector, the Ministryo f Education estimates that the Ziguinchor region has a school&#13;
deficit: 37 schools that have either closed or failed to open, for a deficit o f 96 classrooms affecting&#13;
approximately 3,840 students. As a result, most students have moved toward the city and department o f&#13;
Ziguinchor where they attend school inmakeshift buildings. Paradoxically, the Ziguinchor region has the&#13;
highest level o f school enrollment in Senegal, reflecting the Casamanqais' strong belief inthe benefits of&#13;
education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.4    ECONOMICIMPACT&#13;
&#13;
The Casamance conflict has taken a toll on the southern part o f Senegal, a region with great agricultural&#13;
potential, abundant rain, and land suited to the cultivation o f rice, fruits, and vegetables. Forestry&#13;
resources are also plentiful and include many indigenous species. Important fish resources are provided&#13;
by the 86-km-long coastline, the 300-km-long river and numerous ponds. In the mining sector,&#13;
Casamance has oil, peat bogs, gnafouran, and shell sediments inthe river's islands. The land issue, which&#13;
i s central to Casamance economic life, i s at the epicenter o f the conflict and i s therefore critical to its&#13;
resolution.&#13;

             affected by the violence.&#13;

&#13;
      (iv) Finally, the formal private sector, particularly in the tourism area, is plagued by the lack o f&#13;
             safety, and some companies have hadto cease operation.&#13;
&#13;
 It is difficult to assess the overall impact o f the Casamance conflict on the Senegalese economy. Impact&#13;
 on the government budget i s limited interms o f expenditures. Top officers inthe Senegalesearmy (Armde&#13;
Nationale Sdnkgalaise, ANS) state that defense budget increases have been small since the army opted to&#13;
transfer troops into Casamance to enforce law and order. The conflict i s therefore not consideredto have a&#13;
 significant impact onmilitary resource^.^&#13;
Beyond the capital destruction costs, most o f the economic losses for Senegal are thus opportunity costs&#13;
arising from the inability to exploit Casamance's economic potential, which has inturn had an impact on&#13;
the State's fiscalrevenues, poverty alleviation andGDP growth.&#13;
Duringthe conflict, public investmentinCasamancebythe Government o f Senegal remained constant or&#13;
even increased. However, many projects were slowed or even stopped due to the lack o f security.&#13;
It is difficult to estimate what the volume of private investments would have been under normal&#13;
circumstances and what benefits it would have brought to both the local and national economies. Still, it&#13;
seems that investments have not been commensurate with this region's potential. Tourism has been&#13;
negatively affected, with many investors shunningthe region for fear o fpotential customer flight.&#13;
The greatest economic impact has been on the poorest o f the poor in Casamance, and especially its&#13;
farmers. Inparticular, they have been unable to fully exploit the locally available agricultural potential.&#13;
The sowing o f landmines, which began in August 1997, led the NGO Rencontre Africaine pour la&#13;
Dtifense des Droits de 1'Homme (RADDHO) to assert at the Organization o f African Unity (OAU)&#13;
Summit in Ouagadougou inJune 1998 that no rice had been cultivated inCasamance during the previous&#13;
crop year and that none would likely be planted that year. Likewise, fruit and vegetable crops are also&#13;
very probably affectedbythe presence of landmines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.5     RECONSTRUCTIONEFFORTS&#13;
&#13;
There are many development projects in this region, o f which some are described in the following&#13;
paragraphs. Yet few so far have offered activities specifically aimed at post-conflict reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
     (i)    The only agencies active in mine clearance are the French NGO Handicap International (HI)&#13;
            and, to a lesser extent, UNICEF. HI offers social and medical assistance to land mine victims&#13;
            and has started mine hazard outreach and training campaigns. These activities are ongoing, and&#13;
            HIis seeking supplemental fundingto continue its activities. HIalso wishes to conduct a Level&#13;
            1 Survey o f mine-infested zones, subject to funding.6 UNICEF, whose 2001 program was&#13;
            financed by USAID, i s collaborating with HIon outreach campaigns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4 It mustbe acknowledged, however, that the tax recovery rate has always been low, even inthe absence of such a&#13;
declaration.&#13;
  This assertion is questionable since it assumes that troops stationed inCasamance do not cost more than in other&#13;
places. No data is available to refute this, however.&#13;
 "This [survey level I]is the investigation o f suspected minedareas to collect information onthe general location o f&#13;
mines. Ths information gathering process i s intended to identify general details o f where the mines may be located&#13;
and which areas are safe. I t will also establish high and low risk areas, in which case further planning can be&#13;

&#13;
    (ii)UNICEF       has also been involved in aiding displaced persons, as has the World Food Program&#13;
          (WFP), which launched a Food for Work program in 2001 in support o f Internally Displaced&#13;
          Persons (IDPs) and other affected people. UNICEF's program "aims to support people&#13;
          negatively impacted by the crisis and to create a peace-enabling environment through better&#13;
          access to basic social services."&#13;
    (iii)Althoughthereisnodedicateddemobilizationprogram,UNICEFisworkingonpeace-building&#13;
          through its program, as i s USAID, which finances similar small programs in both the&#13;
          Ziguinchor and Kolda regions.&#13;
Despite the sporadic violence in Casamance, none o f the many other development programs i s&#13;
specifically aimed at conflict resolution. For instance, the multi-donor Transport Sector Program&#13;
(Programme Sectoriel des Transports 2, PST2) is engaged inrehabilitating the Diouloulou-Bignona road&#13;
and the port o f Ziguinchor. Similarly, a few decentralization promotion projects, such as the EU's&#13;
PADEL (Projet d'appui a la dkcentralisation et au dkveloppement local) or the French Cooperation's&#13;
ADDEL (Projet d'appui au dkveloppement local en Casamance) or GTZ's PAARZ (Projet d'appui a&#13;
1'autopromotion de la Rkgion de Ziguinchor) are ongoing. They are progressing, although sometimes&#13;
very slowly. Since early 2004, many initiatives have emerged:&#13;
          These include, among others, GTZ's financial and technical support, amounting to CFAF 3.4&#13;
          billion, for the Projet d'Appui au Dkveloppement Socio-kconomique pour la Paix en&#13;
          Casamance (PROCAS), an essential component o f which i s the improvement o f basic service&#13;
          provision and infrastructures, primarily by rebuilding homes through the traditional solidarity&#13;
          system, and the rehabilitation or diggingo f modernwells to improve accessto drinking water.&#13;
          Canada recently formulated a program for the restoration o f socio-economic activities in&#13;
          Casamance through the local development fund (Fonds Local de Dkveloppement - FLD) made&#13;
          available to the Government. This program, valued at CFAF 1.3 billion and defined as part o f&#13;
          the PRAESC, revolves around support for the development o f community infrastructures and&#13;
          the promotiono f socio-economic activity.&#13;
          USAID has launched a support program to re-establish viable communities by grouping&#13;
          persons who remained invillages duringthe conflict, IDPs, refugees, as well as ex-combatants&#13;
          o f the MFDC. Financing totaling CFAF 635 million will boost water supply by improving&#13;
          wells or diggingnew ones and byrehabilitating health centers and classrooms.&#13;
          The Islamic Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in A h c a&#13;
          (Banque Arabe pour le DkveloppementEconomique de Afrique - BADEA)have resumedtheir&#13;
          financial support to the Programme de Lutte Anti-Sel (salt abatement program) in the&#13;
          Ziguinchor and Kolda regions for the construction o f anti-salinization andor water retention&#13;
          dikes.&#13;
         Italy has initiated a new program named ((Fonds Local de Dkveloppement de Skdhiou en&#13;
         Moyenne Casamance )) (local development fund for SCdhiou in Moyenne Casamance)&#13;
         amounting to CFAF 2,500 million. This program i s a follow-on o f the PRIMOCA and has two&#13;
         areas o fintervention:&#13;

           which have beenrebuilt so far.&#13;
&#13;
     (x)   Through its annual investment budget (Budget Consolide'd 'Investissemen, BCI), the GoS will&#13;
           finance over the 2003-2005 period the water management infrastructure project for Basse&#13;
            Casamance (Projet d 'Am&amp;agement Hydro-Agricole de la Basse Casamance) for a total o f&#13;
           CFAF 800 million, as well as the provisiono f public services inthe Kolda region for a total o f&#13;
           CFAF 2,200 million, which includes:&#13;

 Over the same period, the GoS will provide counterpart financing totaling CFAF 2,658 million for&#13;
 projects and programs specific to Casamance that are funded by its partners. GoS i s also contributing&#13;
 counterpart fundingfor national projects and programs of which Casamance-related activities are a part.&#13;
 Finally, a mine clearing unit from the Senegalese army has been assigned for the long term to the&#13;
 Ziguinchor region. This unit has been provided with up-to-date equipment (e.g., mine detectors) and has&#13;
received support from national service volunteers to perform humanitarian mine clearing o f villages and&#13;
roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.6    CROSS-SECTORAL NEEDSAND SECTORAL PRIORITIES&#13;
&#13;
Current and planned activities in Casamance are in urgent need o f coordination. Indeed, many activities,&#13;
however limited, are being implemented in the absence of proactive and global dialogue, despite the&#13;
Government's official stand against piecemeal approaches. As a result, comprehensive and detailed&#13;
knowledge o f the issues at stake in Casamance i s laclung and interventions occur on a case-by-case basis&#13;
depending on the agenda, capacity, and available funding o f the implementing agency. Problem-solving i s&#13;
thereby complicated, since few if any agencies can provide a comprehensive solution to any given&#13;
problem. In addition, numerous and substantial sector needs must be addressed in order to lay a solid&#13;
groundwork for economic and social recovery inCasamance.&#13;
2.6.1    Land mine clearance&#13;
The first land mines appeared in Casamance in 1991. Until 1997, their use was limited, improvised and&#13;
sporadic, usually at the initiative o f individual combatants. Since mines did not yet pose a significant&#13;
hazard, an elaborate mine clearance policy was not justified. The existence o f mine stockpiles hadnot yet&#13;
beenascertained. Between 1991and 1997, landmineincidents claimed only about a dozen victims. It was&#13;
only in 1997, i.e., about fifteen years after the conflict had begun, that the use o f land mines intensified in&#13;
Casamance, a trend manifested in the large number o f incidents noted. From 1997 onward, mines began&#13;
to be deployed according to conventional military methods.&#13;
Land mines mainly affect local populations, claiming numerous victims and causing family upheaval&#13;
through the loss o f a parent or the infliction o f a severe physical injury. Their economic impact i s also&#13;
substantial. Because many accidents occur as people are harvesting crops or collecting firewood, farmers&#13;
avoid activities on portions o f their village lands out o f fear. It i s the fear o f a potentially mined area,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Senegal - Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                                8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 more than the actual number o f mines placed, which influences the population's behavior and risk-&#13;
 avoidance strategy. Different age groups exhibit different behaviors, and women and children often pay&#13;
 the heaviest price. Behavioral changes caused by the actual or supposed presence o f land mines have a&#13;
 lasting impact on production potential.&#13;
 2.6.2     Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration (DRR)&#13;
 There are no reliable estimates o f the number o f combatants needing to be reinserted into civilian life.'&#13;
 According to information gathered (based on sightings o f combatants in the Bignona area during the&#13;
 elections, reports by NGOs onrecent MFDC activity, the existence o f four fronts, etc.), there are probably&#13;
 about 1,200-2,000 combatants' who would be subject to eventual demobilization. It i s also probable that a&#13;
 number o f young people are recruited for short-term actions, but do not actually leave their villages&#13;
 and/or families tojoin "the underground".&#13;
 In addition to these active combatants, two specific groups have been directly affected by the combat:&#13;
 namely, injured or chronically illex-combatants and the family members &amp;e., widows and orphans) o f&#13;
 those killed in combat. There are also a number o f women who may have been forcibly recruited by&#13;
 combatants. These two groups are believed to total 2,300 persons.&#13;
 These various groups are assumedto be accompaniedby their immediate families. The exact whereabouts&#13;
 o f these families are obviously not h o w n at present, but they are probably among the refugees in Guinea&#13;
 Bissau and The Gambia. Therefore, ifwe assume an average of 7 additional persons for each person to be&#13;
 demobilized, the total number o f persons would be 18,400, a figure exceeding the currently estimated&#13;
 total number o frefugees."&#13;
 2.6.3     Local development&#13;
 The effects o f the crisis have been most severe in Basse Casamance (Ziguinchor region), the southern&#13;
part o f the dkpartement o f Stdhiou (arrondissements o f Tanaff and Diattacounda) and the southeastern&#13;
part o f the dkpartement o f Kolda, where observers note that many activities contributing to the region's&#13;
wealth have been abandoned due to the hazardous conditions. The conflict has therefore contributed to a&#13;
decline incereals production (and thus to a deterioration in food security"), which went from 41,600 tons&#13;
in 1990 to 33,500 tons in 1996, a drop of 19.7 percent. The reappearance of mines in 1997 accentuated&#13;
the downward activity trend, despite rainfall that was once again "normal". Natural resource management&#13;
projects, many involving costly infrastructures, were scaled back or even stopped.&#13;
Important projects (such as the expansion o f the Ziguinchor industrial zone that was to have included the&#13;
establishment o f about fifteen SMVSMEs by 2000) have been suspended or cancelled, and tourism has&#13;
been seriously disruptedfor several years, although a modest recovery has been noted over the past few&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'ThisNovember&#13;
7      is true despite meetings with political and military leaders o f the MFDC.&#13;
  In            2003, an authorized military spokesman estimated this number at 500 combatants at most.&#13;
  According to some sources, a considerable number o f women are active inthe `underground'. They are thought to&#13;
be involved in particular in weapons trafficking and distribution (e.g., munitions transport and placement o f land&#13;
mines). Rumor has it that they are paid each time a land mine claims a victim, with the price depending on whether&#13;
the victim was a civilian or a soldier. MFDC authorities reject this claim, however, citing the Diola tradition that&#13;
bars women from combat. N o mention is made o f child soldiers.&#13;
10 This figure would be a maximum. Indeed, according to tradition, warriors (or combatants inthis case) are young&#13;
unmarried men, and warrior/combatant status ends with marriage. It is therefore possible that the direct dependents&#13;
o f combatants are few innumber.The situation is obviously different inthe case o f leaders and commanders.&#13;
I1 The special CRD report dated May 15, 1999 conceming the Prime Minister's visit at that time mentions a decline&#13;
inagricultural activity o fover 50percent, according to then-recent studies.&#13;

          -                                                                                                    9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At the socio-economic level, many private and/or community-level infrastructures -mainly homes, wells,&#13;
roads, community gardens, community centers, individual and community plantations - have been&#13;
 abandoned or even destroyed.&#13;
Inaddition, there has been a marked population movement (involving over 28,200 people) away from&#13;
villages that have become unsafe. This has led to increased population density in various townships&#13;
(communes)'2o f both regions, and especially in the regional capitals. Inthe region o f Ziguinchor, there&#13;
are indications that over 231 villages have been abandoned. In the region o f Kolda, according to a&#13;
 summary provided up by the prefect o f the department o f SCdhiou in June 2003, 69 villages in the two&#13;
arrondissements o f Diattacounda and Tanaff, which are the most affected by the conflict, with a total&#13;
population o f 21,780 inhabitants, have been abandoned.&#13;
According to government sources inZiguinchor, over 37 schools (or 96 classrooms) there have sustained&#13;
physical damage, and 31 o f those have been completely abandoned. To deal with the classroom shortage&#13;
in the region, local populations have constructed temporary shelters: 519 inthe department of Bignona,&#13;
 122 in Oussouye and 177 in Ziguinchor. Inthe department o f SCdhiou, 75 temporary shelters have been&#13;
builtinDiattacoundaand22 inTanaff, usingout-of-pocket contributions o fthe localpopulation.&#13;
Inadditiontothedamageto schools' infrastructure, theregionofZiguinchor hassustained damageto 15&#13;
youth centers, 32 shops, 15 bridges and the customs checkpoint o f SilCty (on the Gambian border). In&#13;
terms o f medical and social welfare infrastructures, available information indicates that 28 health posts&#13;
have been abandoned in the region o f Ziguinchor. Those involved in community development and the&#13;
decentralization process feel that the State has transferred skills without transferring the means, know-&#13;
how andmechanisms needed to facilitate localdevelopment.&#13;
Livestock theft, especially in the Kolda region, was regularly reported in 2001 and 2003. Revenues&#13;
derivedfrom natural resource useby the Forestry Service have also declined by 62.2 percent, from CFAF&#13;
45 millionin 1991 to CFAF 17 millionin 1997.&#13;
2.6.4    InfrastructureRehabilitationandReconstruction&#13;
Some populations face enormous difficulties due to a lack o f infrastructures or the non-functionality o f&#13;
those that do exist. Most problems are in the sectors o f transportation, education, health, hydraulics,&#13;
electricity, irrigationinfrastructures, environment, fisheries, and tourism; to name only a few.&#13;
2.6.4.1    Transportationsector&#13;
Ifthere is an issue directly relevantto the security situation inCasamance, itisthat ofthe accessibility of&#13;
the southern regionv i s - h i s the rest o f Senegal as the Gambia River i s a natural barrier. Eventhough, the&#13;
development partners o f both countries have long stated their willingness to contribute to the buildingo f a&#13;
bridgeover The Gambia River, there i s still some political disagreement betweenthe two governments on&#13;
thisissue.&#13;
Without a solution, the options for enhancing access to Casamance will mainly consist of road&#13;
rehabilitation operations. Roads in Casamance are generally in very poor shape (as they are in Senegal&#13;
generally), with 28.5 percent (1998 estimate) o f paved roads and 82 percent (1994 estimate) o f unpaved&#13;
roads inpoor condition.&#13;
Based on the general comparative situation as o f November 2000, it appears that road networks in&#13;
Casamance are in worse condition than the national average. The security situation cannot be blamed&#13;
entirely for this difference, since the regions o f Diourbel and Kaolack are also below average; the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'*According    to government authorities in Ziguinchor, 15,000 people have taken refuge in the commune of&#13;
Ziguinchor (as of May 5,2003)&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Senegal - Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                            10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 situation common to Casamance's two regions i s exacerbated, however, by the physical inaccessibility&#13;
 specific to them.&#13;
 As o f late 2003, air transport was still the safest means o ftransportation despite its relatively highcost for&#13;
 most potential customers. Indeed, the capsizing on September 26,2002 o f the ferry the "M.S. L e Diola"&#13;
 significantly slowed the maritime connection between Ziguinchor and Dakar, which had been the most&#13;
 reliable and cheapest means o f transporting people and goods between those two cities. That route i s now&#13;
 served only by a military vessel and a small cargo ship. The Govemment i s inthe process o fpurchasing a&#13;
 new boat to serve the route and has indicated its intention to bring in private participation in the&#13;
 company's management.&#13;
 Since the option initially chosen by the Ministry o f Transport and Equipment, Le., to charter a vessel by&#13;
 the end o f October 2003, has not materialized, financing was mobilized by the German Cooperation and&#13;
 the EBI to purchase a vessel. This process could take 10-12 months, however. The option o f private&#13;
 managementwill be studied for that boat.&#13;
 2.6.4.2   Educationsector&#13;
With a gross enrollment rate o f 93 percent in 1999, the region ofZiguinchor ranks second after Dakar. Its&#13;
 87,739 students are distributed among 20 pre-schools, 292 primary schools, 28 middle schools, 5&#13;
 secondary schools, and 16 technical and vocational schools.&#13;
The unsafe conditions have either closed or immobilized 37 schools in the region. They account for 96&#13;
classrooms that would serve about 3,840 students. Most (70 percent) o f this displaced student population&#13;
i s concentrated in the department and commune o f Ziguinchor, where they are accommodated in&#13;
temporary shelters.&#13;
According to the Ziguinchor school inspectors, three schools (81 classrooms in Bignona) have reopened&#13;
inthe region of Ziguinchor with the assistance of UNICEF and so-called "pioneer" teacher^.'^ In2002,&#13;
there were 27 `pioneers' inthe field. Many classrooms inthe region are still intemporary shelters: 519 in&#13;
Bignona, 122inOussouye and 177 inZiguinchor.&#13;
For the rural communes (communes ruraux, CRs) affected by the conflict in the arrondissements o f&#13;
Diattacounda (CRs o f Diattacounda, Samine, Djibanar) and Tanaff (CRs o f Tanaff Niagha, Simbanding&#13;
Brassou) in the department o f SCdhiou (Kolda region), there are 35 and 22 temporary shelters,&#13;
respectively. These two arrondissements have, respectively, 15 and 23 classrooms that lack teachers.&#13;
According to available statistics, the gross enrollment rate inthe Koldaregionwas 70 percent in 1999.&#13;
2.6.4.3    Healthsector&#13;
The health care situation is critical in Casamance, especially in the region o f Kolda, with insecurity an&#13;
aggravating factor. Populations on the move often leave everything behindintheir fear o f the fighting and&#13;
are forced to move inwith relatives. This leads to overcrowding and fosters the spread o f disease.&#13;
Insum, the healthcareinfrastructures andequipment inthe regionface the following constraints: (i)          poor&#13;
spatial distribution, inadequate number o f health posts and scarcity o f drugs; (ii)  inadequate size o f many&#13;
current public health posts; (iii)    inadequate, absent or outdated equipment; (iv) absence o f fencing,&#13;
lodging and running water in certain posts; (v) shortage, or even absence, of staff in health care centers&#13;
and health posts; (vi) shortage o f hospital beds relative to demand; (vii) shortage or absence o f logistical&#13;
means; (viii) scarcity o f hnds for the purchase o f drugs and fuel; (ix) dilapidated buildings and/or&#13;
unsanitary conditions in some public health facilities; and (x) the poor conditi8on o f roads, which makes&#13;
the evacuation o fpatients difficult.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l3These "pioneers", who are village residents, are unpaid volunteers.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Senegal - Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                        11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Inthe regionofZiguinchor the health service is poor: 28 healthposts (HPs) out of 81 are closed (5 for&#13;
 lack o f staff and/or equipment and 23 due to unsafe conditions, o f which 11 have been de~troyed)'~;3&#13;
 HPs are operating with moderate technical facilities and reduced staff; the regional hospital is&#13;
 overburdened, and the mental health center at KCnia barely hnctional (due to a lack o f staff and&#13;
 dilapidated facilities). The region o f Kolda has one o f the weakest levels o f coverage in the country in&#13;
 terms o f health care infrastructures and staff. The average radius o f a health post service area exceeds 15&#13;
 km.&#13;
 2.6.4.4    Hydraulics sector&#13;
Despite its abundant rainfall, Casamance has significant problems with safe water supply. The rate of&#13;
 coverageof the population is 38 percent in Ziguinchor and 26 percent in Kolda, which is far below the&#13;
national average o f 54 percent.&#13;
Despite the difficulties, facilities (boreholes, tubewells or wells) have been built but not in sufficient&#13;
numbers. Throughout Senegal, the State (with the help o f its development partners) and NGOs have&#13;
installed 927 motorized boreholes; 74 equipped boreholes or wells; 1,028 boreholes, tubewells or wells&#13;
equipped with manual pumps; and 2,100 wells or tubewells usingtraditional water-extraction systems.&#13;
2.6.4.5    Hydro-agricultural installationssector&#13;
Casamance possesses good potential for irrigated agriculture (throughcontrolled flooding). About 9,000&#13;
ha o f irrigated perimeters are being worked inBasse Casamance and Moyenne Casamance. On the other&#13;
hand, salt encroachment may seriously compromise this potential if the phenomenon i s not addressed.&#13;
Thisrequires substantial investment, however, inthe area o f hydro-agricultural installations.&#13;
A number o f primary works have been built under large programs, but practically no secondary works.&#13;
Secondary infrastructures should therefore be built over the short-tenn wherever they are feasible and of&#13;
immediate utilityto the population.&#13;
Over the longer term, the large-scale primary infrastructure programs should be re-launched after an in-&#13;
depth study of surface water trends in recent years. It should be noted that no hydraulic facility has&#13;
suffered any damage because o f the conflict.&#13;
2.6.4.6    Environmentalsector&#13;
With regard to the environment, the plundering of forest species is striking in Casamance. Hazardous&#13;
conditions prevent Water and Forestry Service agents from venturing into the bush. Wood-cutting i s&#13;
therefore occurring inan anarchic fashion, leading to substantial deforestation.&#13;
Inthe very short term, one can hope that improved security conditions will enable Water and Forestry&#13;
Service agents to resume their surveillance and maintenance o f wooded areas. This should stop, or at least&#13;
slow, the current deforestation. However, the long-term mode o f conservation and exploitation o f these&#13;
natural resources will needto bere-defined.&#13;

&#13;
InNovember 2000, the Ministryof Economy and Finance contacted the main donors interested inthe&#13;
Casamance issue to request their participation inrecovery activities in Casamance under the coordination&#13;
o f the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This&#13;
collaboration led to the Programme de Relance des Activitks Economiques et Sociales en Casamance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l4The district ofZiguinchor is the most affected bythese closures (11posts).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                         12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 (PRAESC). PRAESC i s a comprehensive and evolving document that defines a framework and activities&#13;
 aimed at Casamance's recovery. The document was drawn up under the leadership o f the World Bank,&#13;
 with a Japanese Government grant from the Special Fundfor Policy and HumanResources Development&#13;
 (PHRD). It i s based on high-level discussions with many individuals and organizations, both&#13;
 governmental and non-govemmental, who had solid knowledge o f field conditions.&#13;
 The PRAESC was designed with the goal o f coordinating all activities in Casamance in order to avoid&#13;
 redundancies and inefficiencies resulting from a disorderly approach by multiple donors and programs,&#13;
 and o f ensuring that Casamance's fundamental, initial reconstruction needs are properly met. The&#13;
 PRAESC will be implementedby the ANRAC.&#13;
 Priority Interventions&#13;
 The top priority i s the re-establishment o f safe conditions and basic social and infrastructure services in&#13;
 the two administrative regions that make up Casamance. Once peace agreements are signed by all parties,&#13;
 the following tasks are urgent:&#13;
     o demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants so that they can return to socially and&#13;
         economically stable civilian lives;&#13;
     o restoration o f public safety through quick and precise location o f minefields, and commencement&#13;
         o f the mine clearance process as soon as possible;&#13;
     o restoration o f effective primary and secondary economic and social infrastructure, and especially&#13;
         transport infrastructures, the lack o f which i s currently hindering Casamance's economic&#13;
         development&#13;
     o support for communities' efforts to jumpstart their local social infrastructure, as well as support&#13;
         for individuals and groups o f persons willing to initiate small business activities and thus revive&#13;
         local economies.&#13;
Preparatory studies must also be made to assess the root causes o f the conflict and to lay the groundwork&#13;
for Casamance's future development prospects, by means o f data-gathering studies needed to generate&#13;
informationon regional strengths and weaknesses.&#13;
&#13;
3.1    PR4ESC'S GENERAL OBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
PRAESC's general objectives are to (1) facilitate the quick restoration o f a beneficial economic and social&#13;
environment in Casamance, similar to that existing in the rest o f Senegal; and (2) lay the groundwork for&#13;
sustainable long-term development inthe region, while fully respecting its specificities.&#13;
&#13;
3.2    SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
The Mine Clearance (MC) program aims at minimizing as much as possible the risks linked to the&#13;
presence o f mines in some areas, to permit economic recovery and a return to normal life for refugees.&#13;
This program is a prerequisite to all other interventions, and involves at the very least the immediate&#13;
identification and marking o f potentially mine-infested areas. However, it i s estimated that complete mine&#13;
clearing o f the region may take up to five years. The program, through other donors, will launch&#13;
immediate activities to reach, as quickly as possible, a level o f security high enough to allow economic&#13;
and social recovery inhigh-priority, heavilypopulated areas.&#13;
The Demobilization, Reinsertion, and Reintegration (DRR) program aims to enable ex-combatants and&#13;
groups directly affected by the conflict make the transition to a stable civilian life. This program will&#13;
support those men and women and their families until they return to socially and economically stable&#13;
civilian positions.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                                  13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Local Development (LD) program complements the DRR program. The Business Initiative Support&#13;
 (BIS) subprogram aims at facilitating individual or group for-profit activities. Although this subprogram&#13;
will be open to everyone in Casamance, ex-combatants are expected to be its first beneficiaries. The&#13;
 Community Infrastructure        (CI) subprogram will re-start community investment in local social&#13;
infrastructure, thus increasing community access to social services, as well as access to water through the&#13;
construction or rehabilitation of village water points..&#13;
The Supra-Community Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (SCIRR) programwill allow the&#13;
resumption o f full operations o f primary and secondary infrastructure that sustained direct or indirect&#13;
damage from the conflict. The objective i s the resumption o f sustainable operation, which implies that&#13;
permanent budgetary and administrative resources for the maintenance and operation o f the&#13;
infrastructures to be rebuilt will be a prerequisite for investments.&#13;
While the aforementioned activities address urgent, short-term needs, they do not deal with the root&#13;
causes o f the conflict. To prepare more ambitious future development activities, the PRAESC will launch&#13;
studies and consultations with the actors involved for the preparation o f a long-term development project.&#13;
The PRAESC has identified the following issues as critical in terms o f addressing the causes o f the&#13;
conflict:&#13;
          Transport link between Casamance and Dakar, Senegal's political and economic capital.&#13;
         Difficulties in reaching Dakar from the Casamance heartland are a major hindrance to&#13;
         Casamance's development, preventing this region from sending its products to Dakar's markets&#13;
         and from getting the political and economic attention it deserves. Since bypassing The Gambia by&#13;
         means o f inland road transport is both time-consuming and costly, two other alternatives have to&#13;
         be developed and improved: the sea link from Ziguinchor to Dakar and land transport through&#13;
         The Gambia.&#13;
         Improved access to speciJiczones in the CasamanceRiver delta, where much o f the population&#13;
         suffers from physical isolation from the rest o f the region.&#13;
         The development of tourism. Casamance i s famous for its scenic beauty, which has always drawn&#13;
         many tourists. The future o f tourism needs to be carefully studied to maximize its benefits for&#13;
         Casamance's population.&#13;
         Water resources. Despite a heavy rainy season, access to potable water i s a problem for several&#13;
         reasons. In the Ziguinchor region, sea water has infiltrated ground water supplies and ground&#13;
         water levels have fallen due to insufficient rains over the past 30 years. The Kolda region lacks&#13;
         adequate water supply facilities. Despite its definite potential, irrigated agriculture i s also inpoor&#13;
         condition due to mismanagement.&#13;
         Natural resources are alsojeopardized by the conflict. Forests, includingthose that are classified,&#13;
         have been under intense pressure.15 Mangroves are also under attack and must be properly&#13;
         managed if they are to be preserved. According to some estimates, fishing resources are being&#13;
         over-exploited and the fisheries sector i s in need o f a general reorganization. Similarly, the&#13;
         forestry and arboriculture sector mustbe revitalized so that it can achieve its full potential.&#13;
         Finally, the land tenure issue requires in-depth study. This question is central, and many assert&#13;
         that it is largely responsible for the eruption o f violence. Although it took a dramatic turn in&#13;
         Casamance, the land issue i s not specific to Casamance, however, and must be studied&#13;
         comprehensively and nationally if a solution satisfactory to all parties is to be found.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l5Class6 means that no one may alter the object - be it a forest, monument or house -- without prior governmental&#13;
consent. The concept is similar to that o f official preservation, patrimony, or heritage status inother venues.&#13;

&#13;
 3.3     PRAESCPRINCIPLES AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
 The design o f the PRAESC i s based on the fundamental principle o f avoiding duplication o f effort. The&#13;
 PRAESC's design favors the use o f existing or upcoming operational projects to implement certain parts&#13;
 o f the program, rather than the creation o f new projects. Inaddition to avoiding duplication o f effort, this&#13;
 principle will permit speedy implementation, since the project's structures are already operational.&#13;
 However, the weakness of this strategy i s that it may hamper ongoing activities. For example, many pre-&#13;
 existing projects were not designed with post-conflict recovery in mind, and they may require some&#13;
 modification in order to be able to carry out activities corresponding to the PRAESC's objectives and&#13;
 methodologies. Inaddition, the implementation o f a given activity using different approaches can create&#13;
 divergences among the various regions, which can in turn cause problems. This potential source o f&#13;
 difficulty can be avoided through effective coordination inthe field.&#13;
 In response to the urgent need, identified during preparation o f the PRAESC, for a focal point for&#13;
 coordination, the Government has created ANRAC, an administrative entity under the authority o f the&#13;
 Prime Minister, which will implement the PRAESC.&#13;

3.5     INTERNATIONAL RESPONSEAND COORDINATIONMECHANISMS IN&#13;
        PLACE&#13;
&#13;
The Casamance conflict has been low inintensity and the Casamance regionhas received donor attention&#13;
and many projects are ongoing, albeit with some difficulties. Moreover, some donors have been directly&#13;
involved in peace-building efforts. For instance, following the 1991 and 1993 peace agreements with the&#13;
MFDC's Front Nord (Northern wing), then the movement's most important faction, a demobilization&#13;
program for young Front Nord combatants was launched in 1992 with EU funding. This program was&#13;
quite innovative in terms o f its methodology o f reinserting ex-combatants either into their original&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                          16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 villages or at least into their ethnic gr0~ps.l~  Other donors such as USAID or UNICEF are involved in&#13;
 similar peace-building and tension-abating efforts.&#13;
 Given these ongoing activities and new developments inthe negotiation process, the GoS has emphasized&#13;
 the need for all donors to work ina collaborative, integratedfashion. The donors have readily adopted this&#13;
 recommendation, and been supportive o f the approach. The EUand UNDP have been assigned the role o f&#13;
 coordinating the activities o f the government's developmentpartners.&#13;
 This coordination has ledto numerousjoint meetingsbetween all donors and GoS representatives, with a&#13;
 view to harmonizing activities, clarifying themes and defining the intervention process. In2000, a core&#13;
 group o f donors including the EU, the UNDP, the World Bank, and USAID worked closely with the&#13;
 Ministry of Finance to draw up terms of reference that described the framework and implementation&#13;
 details to revive development activities in Casamance. This core group o f donors joined the GoS' Groupe&#13;
 de Travail sur la Casamanceto supervise preparation o f the PRAESC. The donors share a willingness to&#13;
 avoid duplication and maximize their outputs to support the peace process. The active support o f most o f&#13;
 them during the PRAESC preparation, and their mobilization o f resources and time to ensure its success,&#13;
 demonstrate their commitment to full participation inpeacefullong-term solutions to Casamance's issues.&#13;
 Moreover, the PRAESC document was the basis for a United Nations (UN) document drawn up in&#13;
 preparation for a roundtable that was scheduled for mid-2001 but was cancelled due to the negotiation&#13;
 stalemate. As o f March 2004, donor commitment to the PRAESC i s strong, and many are willing to share&#13;
 its cost. We are confident that the Program will be fully funded.&#13;
&#13;
                   4.       SECTIONC: BANK'S RESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.1     OBJECTIVES, RATIONALEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
4.1.1 CurrentWorld BankInvolvementin Senegal&#13;
The project was prepared in the context o f the CAS presented to the Board in April 2003. Of the 18&#13;
credits in the portfolio in various sectors, the rural infrastructures and social development fund APLs&#13;
would be particularly usedinBank's response to the Casamance's conflict.&#13;
4.1.2 Rationalefor WorldBankinvolvementinCasamance&#13;
Although the political situation in Casamance i s not completely stabilized, since the different factions o f&#13;
the MFDC are giving contradictory signals, peace i s now regarded as inevitable. Violence has virtually&#13;
ceased and the rare incidents are o f a criminal nature. There i s sufficient progress towards peace.&#13;
The Casamancepopulationnow wants to reap the benefits o f this restoration o fpeace. The GoS intends to&#13;
meet this demand and encourage all its partners to quickly increase their involvement in Casamance, in&#13;
order to support the population inpersuading the few last holdouts to resume a peaceful civilian life.&#13;
A significant presence of the World Bank, a major partner o f the GoS, will send a strong signal to the&#13;
Casamance population that Senegal's partners are willing to support this region's development. Indeed,&#13;
the Bank's absence could be perceived as lack o f confidence or, worse, indifference to the fate o f&#13;
Casamance. Such a signal could retard the restoration o f peace and provoke frustrations that could lead to&#13;
renewed violence.&#13;
As noted above, the WorldBank will not be alone inthis approach. Manypartners have already increased&#13;
their presence inthe field. This presence lacks overall coordination, however, and certain needs are either&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l6 Inthe absenceof available documentation, the PRAESC intendsto learnabout this operation fromits former staff&#13;
currently involved in various projects inCasamance.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
not beingmet or are beingonly partially met. Quick implementation o f a programmatic approach, such as&#13;
the PRAESC, is therefore required. Through the launch of the PRAESC, the World Bank will strongly&#13;
 signal to Senegal's other partners its support for field-level cooperation and coordination, thus&#13;
 encouraging operational dialogue among them, and will help leverage other resources.&#13;
4.1.3    World BankObjectivesin Casamance&#13;
The World Bank will support the PRAESC, a program designed by the GoS for the economic recovery o f&#13;
Casamance. It will finance parts o f the identified activities as well as coordination activities through&#13;
ANRAC.. Thus, the World Bank supports the PRAESC's general objectives.&#13;
4.1.4    WorldBankStrategyin Casamance&#13;
4.1.4.1    Implementationof a CasamanceEmergencyReconstructionSupport Project(CERSP)&#13;
The CERSP will be the World Bank's primary vehicle in Casamance. As an emergency project, it will&#13;
follow the World Bank's special procedures. By definition, it only includes short-term activities. This&#13;
project i s expected to be implemented over a periodo f three (3)years.&#13;
The purpose o f this project i s to fund activities not covered by the current portfolio in Senegal. As&#13;
detailed in Section D on page 18, in addition to the participation in the establishment o f ANRAC, the&#13;
CERSP will also finance the DRR, a portion o f reconstmction and rehabilitation investments, as well as&#13;
other activities such as long-term development studies, conflict early waming and prevention,&#13;
information, monitoringand evaluation, environmental activities, etc..&#13;
4.1.4.2    Other donors' involvement inthe PR4ESC&#13;
The PRAESC i s ambitious and costly and the involvement o f all Senegal's partners i s required to&#13;
implement it fully. As described in paragraph 2.5 on page 5, many donors are willing to commit&#13;
themselves and some have already begun their activities. Therefore, PRAESC financing is, it i s hoped,&#13;
largely inplace.&#13;
Nevertheless, the mine clearance issue i s critical. UNDP has asserted its leadership in this area and the&#13;
European Union i s expected to commit a substantial amount to this component, with support from some&#13;
other bi-lateral donors.17However, it i s not clear that the mine clearing needs identifiedby the PRAESC&#13;
will be covered. Still, this should not compromise World Bank activities in Casamance, because only 5&#13;
percent o fareas will be affected.&#13;
The various PRAESC missions have clearly identified five mined zones in which the accident risk&#13;
issignificant, although limited, owing to the low density o f the mines observed so far. Although mine&#13;
clearing i s needed inthese zones prior to any development activities, they are small relative to Casamance&#13;
as a whole (3.8 percent o f the total area). Moreover, the estimate o f the potentially mined area should&#13;
decrease significant1yl8once the quick light surveys have been carried out.&#13;
&#13;
4.2    LESSONSLEARNEDFROMPASTEXPERIENCES&#13;
&#13;
After the 1991 and 1993 peace accords, a program to demobilize young resistance fighters was carried out&#13;
beginning in 1992 with EUfinancing, and involved inparticular the MFDC's Northern Front, which was&#13;
at the time its largest contingent. The program, under the neutral and fairly modest label o f "micro-&#13;
projects", incorporated some innovative methodologies for the reinsertion o f ex-combatants (not&#13;
necessarily into their home villages but withintheir ethnic group.)&#13;
Lessons learnedfrom experiences inother regions are the following:&#13;

&#13;
 0    It is important to eliminate - or at least limit the danger posedby landmines andto conduct rapid&#13;
                                                      --&#13;
      mine clearance to humanitarian standards so that local populations may return promptly to their usual&#13;
      place o fresidence.&#13;
&#13;
 0    There is a need for rapid creation o f a database o f combatants to be demobilized, so that they can be&#13;
      monitored over the monthdyears following their reintegration. These people, who have lived with&#13;
      violence for prolonged periods, expect the reintegration programto help them handle their day-to-day&#13;
      problems. It i s important to teach them to live as civilians again. This re-learning process is&#13;
      impossible unless their identities and whereabouts are precisely known. The ideal i s to register them&#13;
      upon their first contact with the demobilization program, i.e., when they are disarmed.&#13;
&#13;
0     It is important to limit as much as possible the duration o f the affected people's stay in temporary&#13;
      encampments. Apart from health and logistical issues, prolonged stays bring about behavioral&#13;
      changes in beneficiaries, including anger and passivity, making their economic and social&#13;
     reintegration and the relearning o f autonomy all the more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
0     Support for ex-combatants must be geared to their specific needs, and must at the same time avoid&#13;
      generating a feeling o f unfairness on the part o f non-combatants. It i s important that the benefits of&#13;
     peace be perceived as being equitably bestowed upon all. Differential treatment must be limited and&#13;
     great efforts mustbe made to support the receiving communities, interms o f both local infrastructures&#13;
     and income-generating activities.&#13;
&#13;
0    Quick restoration o f infrastructures is vital to the resumption o f economic activity and increased&#13;
     employment inthe region.&#13;
Since 1999, the OIM has, with World Bank financing, been operating a demobilization program in&#13;
Guinea-Bissau (including the Senegalesemilitary intervention dubbed "Operation Gabou") inthe wake o f&#13;
that country's civil war. The interconnections between events occurring in Guinea-Bissau and the&#13;
situation in Casamance will require close coordination o f post-conflict activities carried out on both sides&#13;
o f the border. For example, if the re-insertion and reintegration o f those demobilized i s done poorly,&#13;
demobilization in Casamance could spur a re-mobilization o f ex-combatants in the ranks o f resistance&#13;
fighters on the Guinea-Bissau side, assuming that the precarious political and military situation in the&#13;
border region persists.&#13;

5.1     PROJECTOBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
The objective o f the PRAESC is the rapid reintegration of the entire population of Casamance into a&#13;
favorable economic and social environment and the establishment o f a foundation for long-term&#13;
sustainable development that takes the region's specificities into account.&#13;
The overall objectives o f the CERSP are to enable the PRAESC to be implemented through its&#13;
coordination and supervisory functions and to helpthe Government o f Senegal to:&#13;
1. demobilize and reinsert 2,300 combatants and other direct victims of the conflict as well as their&#13;
     families;&#13;
2. ensure the social and economic reintegration o f ex-combatants, their families and other persons&#13;
    directly affected by the conflict;&#13;
3.  rebuildor rehabilitate major social and economic public infrashuctures in Casamance inthree major&#13;
    sectors: transport, health and education;&#13;

5.4    RATIONALE FOR THE CERSP&#13;
&#13;
An Emergency Recovery Credit under the Bank's OP/BP 8.50 guidelines is considered the most&#13;
appropriate instrument to support the critical transition process inCasamance because it enables the Bank&#13;
to quickly respond to the GoS request for support. The CERSP's objectives are to quickly restore&#13;
economic activities and social services in key sectors, with targeted spending priorities drawn up by&#13;
central andregional Senegaleseauthorities. The credit would total US$20 millionequivalent.&#13;

 The proposed project will have a high economic and humanitarian impact since its objectives are to&#13;
 (i) restorenormalsocialandeconomicactivitiestoareasdevastatedbywar; and(ii)&#13;
    quickly                                                                                       prepare for&#13;
 future regular development activities in Casamance. Indeed, the project will support the demobilization&#13;
 and reintegration o f a few thousand ex-combatants and direct victims o f the conflict and their families,&#13;
 and restoration o f important local social and economic infrastructures. These emergency actions should&#13;
 therefore contribute to a more sustainable environment in the region by reducing the scope for conflict&#13;
 generated by economic and social disparities.&#13;
&#13;
 5.5   OVERALL INSTITUTIONAL AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
       ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
 Structureofthe CERSP&#13;
 The CERSP will be implemented by ANRAC, a Senegalese administrative structure created by the&#13;
 Government to ensure smooth execution o f the PRAESC.&#13;
 Inorder to satisfy the World Bank's fiduciary requirements for implementation, however, the following&#13;
 changes will need to be made to the structure o f ANRAC.&#13;
 Organizationalset-up ofANRAC&#13;
&#13;
 ANRAC will have a Program Coordinator who will be based in Ziguinchor and will be responsible for&#13;
 implementing operational activities at the field level. Inaccordance with the decree creating ANRAC, the&#13;
 Directeur Gdndral o f ANRAC will delegate the necessary powers to the Program Coordinator. Like all&#13;
 ANRAC personnel, the Program Coordinator is under the direct authority o f the DG-ANRAC and is&#13;
 boundby the terms o f a contract signed with the DG-ANRACacting on behalfo f the Government.&#13;
 Oversight Council&#13;
An Oversight Council will handle strategic coordination at the national level o f all interventions&#13;
 associated with the economic and social recovery o f Casamance.&#13;
 SteeringCommittee&#13;
A PRAESC Steering Committee will be established by decree o f the Prime Minister to translate themes&#13;
defined by the Oversight Council into programs, and particularly to supervise the implementation of the&#13;
PRAESC. This committee, which will be headed by a representative o f the Prime Minister, will be&#13;
composed o f representatives o f the relevant administrations, parties to the reconciliation process, civil&#13;
society, the private sector and local elected officials. The DG-ANRAC, or his representative, will serve as&#13;
the Secretary o fthis Committee.&#13;
The Steering Committee will examine and approve annual work programs and budgets as well as the&#13;
activity and financial reports o f the PRAESC. It will convene meetings at least twice yearly, alternating&#13;
betweenZiguinchor and Kolda. The secretariat o f the PRAESC Steering Committee will be carried out by&#13;
the DG-ANRAC or hisrepresentative.&#13;
The World Bank will help finance the revised structure so that it can carry out the CERSP. In addition,&#13;
the CERSP will finance:&#13;
     0   most o f the activities included under the Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration (DRR)&#13;
         Component;&#13;
     0   a large portion o f the Infrastructure ReconstructiodRehabilitation (IRR) Component;&#13;
     0   preparation o f a long-term development program for Casamance ;&#13;
     0   activities associated with conflict early warning, conflict prevention, and social mobilization.&#13;
Finally, a budget line will be earmarked under the CERSP to finance certain activities resulting from the&#13;
implementation o f environmental protection and social policies.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 5.5.1 Operationalactivitiesfor the implementationof the PRAESC&#13;
 The primary role o f the ANRAC i s to harmonize all reconstruction and development activities initiated by&#13;
 all partners in Casamance. This function will be supported by cross-sectoral activities implemented by&#13;
 specialized staff.&#13;
 5.5.1.1    Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
 Monitoring o f field activities (CERSP's as well as others') will be the responsibility o f the Cellule&#13;
Information, Suivi et Evaluation (CISE).&#13;
 Standard monitoring modalities will be integrated into the CERSP's Procedures Manual in order to&#13;
 facilitate the monitoring and analysis o f the situation. These modalities will also incorporate objectively&#13;
verifiable indicators on the CERSP's performance so as to facilitate comparison. The CISE Officer will&#13;
prepare a monthly implementation monitoring report. This report will be incorporated by the Program&#13;
 Coordinator (PC) into the monthly Implementation Technical Monitoring and Financial report which i s&#13;
 also transmitted to the Director General (DG) on a monthly basis. Each quarter, the DG will prepare an&#13;
 in-depth analysis o f the situation, which will be submitted to the ANRAC Oversight Committee&#13;
 (ANRAC-OC), to the PRAESC Steering Committee and to the relevant donors.&#13;
These M&amp;E activities will be based on a comprehensive and nimble IT system o f field data collection,&#13;
local inputtingand centralization at the ANRAC level, allowing nearly real-time analysis o f activities and&#13;
identification o f needs and o f beneficiaries (especially those fiom the DRR component who will receive&#13;
IDcards inthe interest ofpreventing gaps incoverage ofthe DRRprocess.) ThisIT systemwill include a&#13;
Geographic Information System (GIS) that will, for example, quickly identify gaps in PRAESC&#13;
implementation&#13;
An evaluation o fprogram implementation will be undertaken one to three months after completion of each&#13;
phase o f each component. Each evaluation, conducted by an independent consultant or NGO, will address:&#13;
(i) resultsofprogramimplementation;(ii) impactonthose demobilized, theirfamilies, displaced&#13;
    the                                          the&#13;
persons, refugees and their receiving communities; and (iii)   the adequacy o f institutional and administrative&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
All the evaluations shallbebasedon: (i) ITsystem andthe financial monitoringreports; and(ii)survey&#13;
                                          the                                                         a&#13;
o f beneficiaries' and communities' reactions in order to gauge the impact in the field by means o f direct&#13;
observation and interviews (e.g., with key informants, ex-combatants, community leaders and members o f&#13;
the community).&#13;
5.5.1.2    Conflict early warning and prevention and activities&#13;
Activities implemented by the Cellule d'Alerte et de Pre`vention des Conflits(CAPC) will aim to mitigate&#13;
and prevent the triggering o f social conflicts in Casamance, and to lay the groundwork for sustainable&#13;
regional development at the community andregional levels.&#13;
The more specific objectives are: (i)    to make the population aware o f PRAESC activities in order to&#13;
create a consensus around its objectives and approaches; (ii)        to monitor current or potential conflict&#13;
triggers and mobilize the population and stakeholders around conflict early waming, mitigation, and&#13;
resolution instruments; (iii)to support advocacy on the part o f local actors (e.g., civil society, community&#13;
radio stations, etc.) for peace and reconstruction initiatives; (iv) to promote participatory formulation o f a&#13;
sustainable development program that will take into account potential conflict triggers and related&#13;
mitigationactivities.&#13;
The CAPC will implement a conflict early warning and mitigation system based on prior analysis, with&#13;
the relevant actors, of current and potential conflict triggers, as well as informationgathering and periodic&#13;
updating o f this analysis. Data will be collected by stakeholders belonging to the support network as well&#13;
as by AD representatives.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Senegal - Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                         22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When (current or potential) conflicts are identified at or above the community level, stakeholders will be&#13;
assigned to find appropriate solutions or to dispatch representatives o f the parties involved to the&#13;
appropriate institutions. Mobilization campaigns will be launched, in a preventive as well as reactive&#13;
manner, on sensitive issues (conflict triggers) or activities proposed under the PR4ESC. An action plan&#13;
for social mobilization activities will be updated on a regular basis.&#13;
Studies and other analytical activities aimed at formulating a long term sustainable development plan for&#13;
Casamance will be documented on the basis o f the conflict early warning and prevention system and&#13;
social mobilizationactivities.&#13;
5.5.1.3    Environmental and Socialactivities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.5.1.3.1    Social and Environmental Impact&#13;
By restoring a stable and productive economic and social life, for a direct impact on 30,000-to 40,000&#13;
people and an indirect impact on all 1.2 million inhabitants o f Casamance, the PRAESC will have a social&#13;
impact at the regional, national, and international levels. Restoration o f Casamance's optimal economic&#13;
growth potential will have very strong social repercussions on the immediate environment, including all&#13;
o f The Gambia and the northernpart o f Guinea-Bissau.&#13;
The component involving Reconstruction and Rehabilitation o f Non-Community Infrastructures should&#13;
also have minimal negative impacts since it will confine itselfto the restorationo f existing infrastructures.&#13;
On the contrary: if this work is done properly, it will correct previously existing defects in those&#13;
infrastructures. For each o f these major infrastructures, the Procedures Manual will determine the&#13;
environmental studies to be carried out prior to any intervention.&#13;
A Regional Environmental Assessment (REA) covering all o f Casamance was carried out before the start&#13;
o f the program inorder to point up potential problems. The topics covered are the following:&#13;
         0    Management o fnatural resources, and particularly ground and surface water resources;&#13;
         0    The problem o f inland infiltration o f salt water;&#13;
         0    Protection o f mangroves;&#13;
         0   Exploitation and conservation o f fisheries resources;&#13;
         0   Exploitation and conservation o f forests (whether classified or not) and o f other protected&#13;
             areas.&#13;
The main conclusions o fthe REA are the following:&#13;
     (i&gt;Both     environmentally and socially, the Mine Clearance component will have a major positive&#13;
           impact as it will allow for better management o f natural resources and prevent further&#13;
           accidents.&#13;
     (ii)The socialimpact oftheDemobilization, ReinsertionandReintegrationcomponent, ifwell&#13;
           managed, is self-evident and may well transcend the regional context. The Community&#13;
           Development component i s expected to have limitednegative impacts because o f the small size&#13;
           o f the infrastructures involved. The component will have a definite positive impact in cases&#13;
           where the interventions have a clear environmental protection objective, such as anti-&#13;
           salinization dams and measures against soil degradation. The component dealing with the&#13;
           Reconstruction and Rehabilitation o f Non-Community Infrastructures may have major negative&#13;
           impacts, even if these are limited to existing structures. On the other hand, this component&#13;
           couldhave a distinct positive impact incases where it corrects existing infrastructure problems.&#13;
     (iii)TheREAincludesaEnvironmentalandSocialManagementFrameworkofPRAESC.This&#13;
          plan (PCGES) identifies the Casamance context in terms o f regional priorities for&#13;
          environmental and social management, specifically for the two regions o f Ziguinchor and&#13;
          Kolda, and in terms o f the options allowed under the SafeguardPolicies. The PRAESC triggers&#13;

          Safeguard Policy OP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement, a special Resettlement Policy&#13;
         Framework was prepared for PRAESC and issued as a separate document. In view o f the&#13;
          several international waterways in the Casamance region, and the possible use o f these waters&#13;
         under the PRAESC program, Safeguard policy OP 7.50 requires that neighboring states and/or&#13;

&#13;
5.6.1 Program of Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration (PDRR)&#13;
5.6.1.1   Objectives&#13;
The objective o f the PDRR i s to meet the most acute needs o f groups directly affected by the conflict in&#13;
Casamance and to help them resume a stable and sustainable economic and social life. The DRR&#13;
component will be divided into two sub-components, each having specific objectives.&#13;
&#13;
0 Sub-component1:Demobilization, Reinsertion andReintegration (DRR) of Ex-Combatants&#13;
The objective o f this sub-component is to support the demobilization, reinsertion and reintegration o f ex-&#13;
combatants o f various groups (i.e., irregular forces) involved inthe Casamance conflict in order to allow&#13;
them to attain a socio-economic level comparable to that o f the majority o f the rural population o f the&#13;
region. This will consolidate the end o f the Casamance conflict, thus reducing insecurity inthe region and&#13;
allowing economic and social development to resume.&#13;
&#13;
0 Sub-Component 2:Supportfor Reintegration of Groupsdirectlyaffected by theConflict (Appui ii&#13;
     la Rbintkgration des GroupesdirectementAffect&amp; par le Conflit -ARGA)&#13;
The main objective o f this sub-component is to provide ad hoc support for the reintegration of groups&#13;
directly affected by the conflict (e.g., widows o f combatants, orphans, disabled ex-combatants, women&#13;
recruited forcibly) into a stable economic and social life, as an accompaniment to initiatives already&#13;
proposedby other parties active inthe field.&#13;

 +    Sub-component 1:Demobilization,ReinsertionandReintegration(DRR)of Ex-Combatants&#13;
   + Demobi!i?ed.~erS~Qns&#13;
 The target groups must include all active combatants irrespective o f their affiliation with the various&#13;
 military fronts or factions. Every demobilized person must be defined as a "vulnerable ex-combatant".&#13;
 The beneficiary i s to choose the assistance he/she needs. In order to bring this about, the Program o f&#13;
 Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration (PDRR) must offer a wide range o fbenefits. The details o f&#13;
 these benefits remainto be specified.&#13;
 Regarding combatants to be demobilized, the PDRR o f the PRAESC concerns active military forces&#13;
 consisting o f some 2,000 combatants. To the extent that each family includes about 8 individuals, this&#13;
 sub-component, the PDRR, would directly affect nearly 16,000 people.&#13;
 The criteria for selecting persons eligible to benefit from the demobilization and reinsertion program must&#13;
 be transparent, so as to prevent any discrimination on the basis o f ethnicity, region or gender. However,&#13;
 the identification o f combatants to be demobilized may pose problems. Inthe likely event that the MFDC&#13;
 does not have any troop rosters, the receipts issued to ex-combatants at the time they tum in their&#13;
 weapons will serve as a baseline reference. Finally, the ex-combatants may be grouped into billets for&#13;
 purposes o f determiningtheir numbers and characteristics.&#13;
 The characteristics o f every ex-combatant must be recorded with precision. Combatants will receive&#13;
 assurances that, in allowing themselves to be counted, they will not be risking any reprisals or legal&#13;
proceedings.&#13;
The liberation o f ex-combatants has important consequences for their families and communities. If the&#13;
 spouses and children are to enjoy beneficiary status, ex-combatants must declare them prior to their&#13;
liberation, at the time when data needed for monitoring i s being collected. They must also declare the&#13;
 specific location o fre-settlement, so that collectivities that mightneed specific support under the program&#13;
can be identified. Thus, complementarity between Community Development activities and activities&#13;
associated with the Reintegration o f Ex-Combatants is a fundamental aspect o f the CERSP.&#13;

This sub-component will benefit groups directly affected by the conflict, i.e., the widows o f ex-&#13;
combatants, women who were forcibly pressed into service, handicapped ex-combatants and orphans.&#13;
Estimated numbers o f people to benefit from the activities proposed under this component are roughly&#13;
300 persons.&#13;
Ifthe ex-combatants include childsoldiers (irregular forces) andifthere arenospecializedagenciesinthe&#13;

 (ii) Id.ent~ficatio.n.._slf.need~..and.o~~_sl~~t~es&#13;
 Ifthe PDRRis to be adaptedto needs, those needsmustbe identified. Informationto be gatheredwill be&#13;
 o f three types:&#13;
     0   Beneficiaries' characteristics, needs and aspirations;&#13;
     0   Opportunities and constraints that will emerge when beneficiaries enter the labor market as salaried&#13;
         workers or self-employed persons; and&#13;
     0  The civilian context inwhich the beneficiaries will be living.&#13;
&#13;
 Itis therefore crucial to carry out preliminarystudies. These mustcover the beneficiaries' socio-economic&#13;
 profile, opportunity structure, the social patrimony o f the community and the institutional and&#13;
 organizational structures neededto implement the PDRRprogram.&#13;
 Essential data includes demographic and health data, level o f education, access to resources (e.g., land,&#13;
 capital and other means o f production), work experience, place o f origin, desired resettlement locale and&#13;
 type o f work envisaged after the demobilization. On the basis o f the data gathered, a socio-economic&#13;
 profile o f the beneficiaries will be drawn up.&#13;
 The profile obtained will be usedto classify ex-combatants into the following categories: rural and urban&#13;
 mode o f subsistence, female ex-combatants, child soldiers, disabled ex-combatants, ex-combatants with&#13;
 many years o f service, retirees and particularly vulnerable ex-combatants (e.g., those belonging to ethnic&#13;
minorities). Those who joined up or who served only for short periods may not require any particular&#13;
 assistanceto re-integrate themselves, butwill still need some help with the transition.&#13;
Large-scale studies will take time. It will therefore be useful: (i)  to establish a preliminary profile based&#13;
 on informationobtained inthe context o f a billeting operation, through interviews with discussiongroups,&#13;
cross-referenced with general informationon the economic development o f the region; and (ii)      to perform&#13;
a summary qualitative evaluation o f collectivities and organizational structures. The latter i s best done&#13;
with the collaboration o fprojects and organizations that have been inCasamance for a long time and that&#13;
possess a large amount o f valuable baseline data.&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Deve~o~-mento.f.an..effective..~.arge~ln~-me.~han~Sm&#13;
Once identified, ex-combatants will need valid, non-transferable and un-falsifiable identity documents. A&#13;
certzjicate of liberation providing personal information (including a photo and signature or fingerprint)&#13;
and a section detailing the benefits entitlement may be the best way for ex-combatants to exercise their&#13;
rights. If the benefits are transferable, e.g., in the event o f the bearer's death, the document must also&#13;
include a section pertaining to reversion, including the entitlements o f close relatives. This certificate&#13;
shall be designed to be durable and portable. Documents concerningparticular target sub-groups may also&#13;
be issued: e.g., identity cards for disabled ex-combatants (cartes d'invaliditk) and (for family members)&#13;
certificates o f community residence (attestations de la collectivitk).&#13;
These identity documents fulfill two functions: (i) enable every qualified ex-combatant to exercise&#13;
                                                      they&#13;
his rights; and (ii) exclude those who are not ex-combatants (except spouses and children), i.e., they&#13;
                    they&#13;
prevent fraud. For this purpose, a clear procedure must also be established for the re-issuance o f&#13;
documents in the event of loss or theft. The issuance o f these documents will be computerized and each&#13;
individual affected will thus be entered into the SGI's database.&#13;
It will be crucial that such a system be developed inharmony with the systems and techniques used in&#13;
Guinea-Bissau for counting demobilized persons under its demobilization program.&#13;
&#13;
(iv) Re~nt.egra~l-on-.needs&#13;
Casamance i s still a rural society, with over 75 percent o f its population in rural areas. Most ex-&#13;

&#13;
 the event o f their demobilization. Overall, however, the main requirement o f combatants' families during&#13;
 the critical transition period will probably be money, since basic needs (ie., food, housing, clothing) are&#13;
 not beingmet. Poor households are also characterized by the absence o f basic social services. Finally, the&#13;
 beneficiaries, and particularly former combatants, will need help finding employment.&#13;
 Economic and social reintegration may pose a great challenge for ex-combatants. The PDRR can hope&#13;
 that many ex-combatants will be perceived by the receiving communities as community members. This&#13;
 will be reinforced if socio-cultural reinsertion measures (especially including traditional rituals often&#13;
 performed by female shamans) are well organized."&#13;
&#13;
 0 Phases of thePDRR&#13;
 The PDRR o f the PRAESC will be drawn up on the basis o f the results of the socio-economic profile of&#13;
 MFDC combatants and other beneficiaries, other preparatory work done duringthe demobilization, and&#13;
 the prior analysis o f opportunities for economic reinsertion. It i s also critical to address the need for a&#13;
 reliable mechanism for identifyingbeneficiaries inorder to ensure the program's efficacy.&#13;
 The PDRRtherefore includes four phasesneeded for a global and complete approach, namely:&#13;
 (i)headcount (military identity); (ii)  demobilization (civilian identity); (iii)reinsertion (safety net); and&#13;
 (iv) reintegration (sustainable livelihood) as shown inthe table below.&#13;

The CERSP will only finance reintegration activities and those selected by the individual from&#13;
among those indicated with an asterisk (*). Other actors are expected to participate inthe program in&#13;
the form o f logistical support (e.g., transportation supplied by the Senegalese Armed Forces), assistance&#13;
in kind (e.g., food aid for ex-combatants) and complementary activities essential to the smooth&#13;
implementation o f the program(e.g., support for housing construction for ex-combatants).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20 In the context of projects aimed at education for peace and peace promotion, some intemational projects (e.g.,&#13;
GTZ-PAARZ, CRS, WFD), with their local partners (e.g., NGOs) have already developed such strategies and&#13;
approaches. A program involving a group o ftraditional female shamans seems particularly noteworthy.&#13;

&#13;
 +   Phase 1: Headcountand disarmament&#13;
 An adequate system o f identification i s necessary to avoid delays in implementation o f the PDRR. The&#13;
 Direction de la Ddmobilisation, la Rdinsertion et la Re`inte`gration (DDRR). will begin a process o f&#13;
 identification and counting o f all MFDC combatants in order to computerize them. Demobilization&#13;
 criteria must be defined clearly and precisely by the MFDC. Vulnerability criteria must also be defined&#13;
 without ambiguity by civil authorities after consultation with civil society. An exhaustive headcount o f&#13;
 the target group will allow the PDRRto direct resources to persons who were actually combatants.&#13;
 All combatants will be identified, registered and issued secure identity papers prior to the first phase of&#13;
 demobilization. Data will be processed and entered into a database that will be the basis for the&#13;
 organization o f the demobilizationprocess.&#13;
 This headcount phase is expected to occur during the disarmament process. Combatants will appear&#13;
 before a Disarmament Committee composed o f high-ranking representatives o f the MFDC and&#13;
 Senegalese Army, and by a neutral (non-Senegalese) third party. The combatant will be identified as&#13;
 subject to demobilization and entered into the database. The individual will then trade his weapon for an&#13;
 identity document. Arms will be collected by the weapons-disposal team," which will tally the weapons&#13;
 in the database before destroying them on a daily basis.       22 It has been decided that the disarmament&#13;
team(s) will be mobile so as to limit the need for groups o f armed men to move about.&#13;
The DDRR will be charged with the operational implementation o f this phase, with support and advice&#13;
from the Office o f Demobilization.&#13;
 +   Phase2: Demobilization&#13;
The DDRR will participate in the organization o f start-up procedures and will coordinate them with the&#13;
Office o f Demobilization. These procedures will integrate planning (including schedules, locations,&#13;
number o f persons involved, etc.),          administration (e.g.,    validation o f combatants'      identities,&#13;
documentation, departure certificates and databases) and transportation logistics (including security&#13;
measures). The first o f three disbursements from the amount provisionally earmarked for safety net&#13;
allowances will also occur duringthis period and will be organized and managedby the DDRR.&#13;
&#13;
From a practical standpoint, a database on individual combatants to be demobilized will need to be&#13;
developedby the DDRR, with the help o f the CGI, on the basis o f lists suppliedby the MFDC and survey&#13;
forms. An identification (ID) system with a code to be used for the database will also need to be&#13;
developed and implemented, along with accompanying files containing basic information about the&#13;
demobilized individual and the composition o f his family, hisprofession and/or training, final destination,&#13;
and demobilization benefits to which he i s entitled. This general data file o f the PDRR will be used for the&#13;
subsequent stages (i.e., reinsertion and reintegration) and updated on an ongoing basis with the needed&#13;
information.&#13;
The DDDR, on the basis o f information from the MFDC, will need to develop the demobilization plan&#13;
and calendar. In theory, several options may be examined.&#13;
The assumption used in the present document is, a priori, that demobilization will occur in "wave~",2~&#13;
with the most vulnerable groups having priority. This option would allow for demobilization by locality&#13;
and by group. It i s theoretically recommended, once the combatants to be demobilized have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21Made up o fANS personnel.&#13;
22The method of weapons disposal (via explosives or other means) needs to be chosen so as to ensure daily&#13;
destruction without any stockpiling. Senegalese laws pertaining to the transportation of explosives and weapons&#13;
must also be respected.&#13;
23To the extent that events permit this.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

 identified, that the receiving zones (i.e., the camps) be emptied as quickly as possible so as to avoid the&#13;
 burdeno f managingthese groups (housing, food, medical assistance, etc.) and possible trouble that could&#13;
 emerge over time due to uncertaintiesabout their future.&#13;
 The demobilization plan and calendar must also be analyzed in relation to the subsequent stages and&#13;
 especially inrelationto the schedule for preparation o f the PRAESC structures.&#13;
 During the period in which candidates for demobilization are being assembled, specific food aid&#13;
 programs, as well as medical assistance and prescreening, will need to be provided. A campaign o f civic&#13;
 education and introduction to the PDRR and to the sequential steps inthe process o f reinsertion (benefits&#13;
 and safety net services; eligibility criteria) and reintegration (economic reintegration services and&#13;
 opportunities; eligibility criteria by category) will need to be implemented. The DDRR will be&#13;
 responsible for developing all the documents and procedures manuals relative to the above-mentioned&#13;
points and for training the staffo f the implementing agencies responsible for the activities.&#13;
  + Medica!.examination&#13;
 Medical exams will be an important part o f the departure process. Their objective will be to identify&#13;
 serious ailments or disabilities that could affect ex-combatants' future ability to achieve economic and&#13;
 social reinsertion. They will also make it possible to identify specific needs in terms o f various lunds o f&#13;
rehabilitation. Medical examinations will be conducted using the technical resources available on-site.&#13;
Financial concerns preclude more sophisticated procedures such as blood tests or x-rays.&#13;
The questionnaire will include questions on the patient's socio-economic characteristics, general health,&#13;
injuries and main traumatic experiences, previous operations and hospitalizations, as well as known&#13;
ailments. The list o f symptoms will include, among others: cough, chronic diarrhea, fever, symptoms o f&#13;
venereal disease, alcohol consumption, psychiatric symptoms associated with previous traumas, and&#13;
symptoms o f epilepsy. The examination will also include visible injuries, missing limbs, seriously&#13;
diminished sight or hearing, paralysis and signs indicative o f substance abuse.&#13;
The local team in charge o f medical examinations will receive a brief preparatory training. The data&#13;
obtained will be processed and computerized in the context o f the PRAESC's monitoring system.&#13;
Relevant results o f these examinations will be noted on the departure certificates in order to entitle the&#13;
bearer to specific services. These results will be conveyed quickly to the medical authorities and NGOs&#13;
active inthis area.&#13;
  + Pre&amp;?a!?!-K!?. c!i!?ntation&#13;
The responsibility o f the DDRR, supported by the Conflict Early Warning (CAPC) Unit, in terms o f&#13;
advising combatants, takes effect from the time the combatants are at the Demobilization Center.&#13;
Informationwill be supplied on the PRAESC's PDRR, indemnities, rights and obligations o f combatants&#13;
as well as on the role and functions o f the Decentralized Branches o f the PRAESC and the authorities.&#13;
Advice concerning the proper utilization o f the help provided and codes o f civilian conduct will be an&#13;
integral part o fthe pre-departure orientation.&#13;
The orientation program will be implemented in modules, each dealing with one o f the aforementioned&#13;
themes. Methods will be developed to encourage demobilized persons (as well as their spouses, if they&#13;
were present at the demobilization center) to participate actively in the PDRR program, and joint&#13;
participation o f men and women wiI1be encouraged wherever possible. A consultant and an NGO will be&#13;
recruited to develop and implement the pre-departure orientation program. Total cost o f the pre-departure&#13;
orientationprogram is estimated at CFAF 16.8million, or CFAF 5,600 per demobilized individual.&#13;

&#13;
     + .TranX?ortation&#13;
 Physical settlement will be handled by the centralized organization responsible for transporting&#13;
 demobilized combatants and their familiesz4fiom the Demobilization Center to the chosen destination.&#13;
 Two guidingprinciples underlie the centralization o f the provision o f means o f transportation. One i s the&#13;
 large number and concentration of persons needing transportation as well as security considerations. The&#13;
 other i s that, if transport i s facilitated, people are more likely to actually arrive where they say they want&#13;
 to go, instead o f remaining in the vicinity o f the departure centers. Transport will not be funded by the&#13;
 CERSP. It i s expected that the Senegalesearmy will provide the required means o f transport.&#13;
    + Counselingx???l        KriYa!&#13;
 Local authorities and communities will be made aware o f the needs of combatants' families prior to the&#13;
 implementation o f the PDRR o f the PRAESC. Inaddition, local administrative structures will be charged&#13;
 with receivingand counseling demobilized combatants and their families ifnecessary. Counseling will be&#13;
 organized shortly after the ex-combatants have arrived intheir respective communes or villages, and will&#13;
 deal with most o f the issues already touched upon in the pre-departure orientation program. This work&#13;
 will beperformedbythe ReintegrationCounselors o fthe AD.&#13;
 +     Phase3: Reinsertion&#13;
Any delay inthe demobilization process makes the reinsertion assistance to demobilized persons all the&#13;
more crucial.&#13;
The period between the demobilization and the start o f the economic reintegration process must be the&#13;
focus o f particular attention on the part o f the DG-ANRAC. In planning its programs, it will aim to&#13;
develop an approach adapted to the social, economic and cultural context. The duration o f this stage, as&#13;
well as the benefits (which may be differentiated by category of demobilized person), the modalities and&#13;
schedule o f their distribution must also be the subject o f an in-depthanalysis.&#13;
The primary target o f the reintegration assistance i s not only the ex-combatant himself, but his household&#13;
as well. Duringthe first few months, the household o f the ex-combatant is very vulnerable: basic needs&#13;
such as shelter and a minimumof food security must be met immediately upon arrival inthe receiving&#13;
community. Shelter and food are not enough, however, to allow the demobilized combatant and his&#13;
family to establish themselves as a viable economic and social unit. Additional support is needed to&#13;
ensure that the family's health expenditures for non-chronic illnesses are covered at a level similar to that&#13;
o f the neighbors. In addition, support i s needed to pay the urgent costs o f resettlement until the ex-&#13;
combatant's household begins to produce its ownrevenues.&#13;
   + Calculatlon.ofbaslc-needs&#13;
The regions of Casamance (i.e., Kolda and Ziguinchor), which are among the most disadvantaged, have&#13;
the largest number o f households living below the poverty level: 69 and 51 percent, respectively,&#13;
according to poverty indicators (UNDP Human Development Report, 1998) calculated on the basis o f&#13;
health, education and access to basic services.&#13;
The PDRR o f the PRAESC will provide families o f ex-combatants with temporary relocation funds&#13;
intendedto facilitate the most difficult phase o freintegration into civilian life. This fundallocation willbe&#13;
divided into two parts intendedto : (i)       cover the food needs o f an entire family for one yea?5; and (ii)a&#13;
direct financial allowance for investment in housing (lodging and furnishings) and the non-food&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 consumption (e.g., clothing, health care, education and local transportation). The CERSP will only&#13;
 finance the second part o fthe resettlement allowance, for a total o f CFAF 192,500 per household.&#13;
 Since the safety nets are calculated on the basis o f the needs o f ex-combatants' households, their rationale&#13;
 and utilization should be explained during the pre-departure orientation. Ongoing counseling in the&#13;
 receiving communities should help ensure proper use o f these funds.&#13;
   + Mo&amp;!ities .OfJ?w?"&#13;
 The relocation expenses will be paid in cash in order to allow ex-combatants to exercise some options.&#13;
 This mechanismalso responds to the need, generally expressed by ex-combatants, for cash at the time of&#13;
 their departure. Payinga monetary equivalent of essential goods also reduces transaction costs that could&#13;
 be generated by the provision, transportation, storage and preservation o f goods. This also has the&#13;
 advantage o f introducing purchasing power into the bottom o f the system, i.e., the village, thereby&#13;
 stimulating the production o f localproviders o f goods and services, and energizing the local economy.&#13;
 The temporary relocation allowance will be paid inthree equal installments: the first upon departure, the&#13;
 second about 3 or 4 months later and the third about 6 to 8 months after departure.&#13;
 The first payment will be administered by the DDRR upon the combatants' departure from the&#13;
 Demobilization Center, as will the second and thirdpayments.&#13;
 +   Phase4: Reintegration&#13;
 Inorder to respondto needs expressed by the target groups (i.e., ex-combatants, their dependants as well&#13;
 as other beneficiaries), the PDRR o f the PRAESC includes support to allow the most rapid possible&#13;
 resumption o f stable and sustainable economic activity.&#13;
 Inthe interestofbothefficiency andsocialjustice, there willbenofunds, apart fromthe safetynetfunds,&#13;
 specifically provided for the financing o f economic or social activities undertaken by the beneficiaries.&#13;
 Beneficiaries will therefore be encouraged to avail themselves o f opportunities offered under the other&#13;
 PRAESC components, and particularly the Local Development (LD) component, the purpose o f which i s&#13;
 to support all communities and individuals inCasamance wishingto invest intheir own initiatives.&#13;
 However, since vulnerability i s the main characteristic o f the target groups, certain specific support&#13;
 activities will be undertaken.&#13;
   +   hdividua!ized.monitolingofeachbeneficiKYby.Re.ktegG!tior?. GO-WSE1-0IS&#13;
 The programprovides for enough reintegration counselors so that each beneficiary can meet with one on&#13;
 a regular basis (e.g., monthly), at home if possible. The counselors will inform beneficiaries o f their&#13;
rights, point out local activities likely to be o f interest to them and relevant to their personal aspirations,&#13;
and direct them to locally availablejobs26and training that mightprepare them for a stable and adequately&#13;
remuneratedjob. They will also listen to their grievances and, if necessary, serve as mediators vis-a-vis&#13;
groups or agencies that pose problems. Finally, they will help beneficiaries to assemble the dossiers&#13;
requiredby the development and financing agencies to which they may wishto submit applications.&#13;
This latter work is identical to that which is to be done by the economic promotion agents (Agents de&#13;
Coordination pour la Promotion des Activitis Economiques, AC-PAE). Inthe interest o f coherence and&#13;
continuity, it i s thus proposed that these two positions be merged. The function o f supporting retumees'&#13;
reintegration i s impermanent by nature and PAE activities should move to the forefront within a few&#13;
months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26 Itshould be noted that the Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction component will encourage labor-&#13;
intensive construction methods, thereby fostering localjob creation.&#13;

Following the preliminary study on the opportunity structure, a number o f economic opportunities that&#13;
may lead to beneficiary employment will be identified.&#13;
The DDRR will facilitate training adapted both to beneficiaries' current capacities and to the economic&#13;
opportunities that may be open to them. This training will, to the extent possible, be dispensed by&#13;
agencies already present in Casamance (e.g., projects, NGOs or others). The goal is still the same: i.e.,&#13;
avoiding redundancy andmaximizingthe use o f locally available expertise.&#13;
The CERSP will finance such activities to an amount o f CFAF 137,500 perbeneficiary.&#13;
  + specific.targetgo.up3&#13;
Apart from the support detailed above, specific target groups will benefit from targeted support measures.&#13;
Disabled ex-combatants, victims o f combat and land mines, female soldiers and child soldiers will be&#13;
offered appropriate counseling, medical rehabilitation and support for reintegration through specialized&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
Those medical costs will not be financed by the CERSP.&#13;
Widows o f ex-combatants, orphans, and forcibly recruited women will also receive appropriate&#13;
counseling. The CESRP will finance job training similar to those given to ex-combatants at&#13;
CFAF 137,500 par beneficiary. These groups will also have privileged access to community reinsertion&#13;
funds.&#13;
The ANRAC will collaborate closely with the ministries relevant to disabled ex-combatants, widows, the&#13;
chronically illand victims o f war.&#13;

5.6.2    Infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction&#13;
5.6.2.1    Objectives&#13;
0 Transportationsector&#13;
Regardingroads, the PRAESC aims to address the specific accessibility issues o f Casamance vis-a-vis the&#13;
rest o f Senegal. Casamance's longer rainy season, the greater degree o f danger for the populace, its&#13;
geographic location on a national border and the imperatives o f re-starting economic and social activity&#13;
couldnot be addressedunder the PAST or the PST2.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 Interms of internal andborder access improvement, the programtherefore aims to enhance access for as&#13;
 many rural communities as possible. As for external access improvement, including the option o f going&#13;
 eastward around The Gambia, the program i s engaged in rehabilitating all national and regional roads&#13;
 serving the main towns o f departments, and is therefore inharmony with the objectives o f the PST2.&#13;
 0 Educationandhealthsectors&#13;
 Inorder to encourage the return ofdisplaced populations andretain those that haveremained, the PRRI&#13;
 will aim, in the sectors o f education and health, to rehabilitate staff to existing school and healthcare&#13;
 infrastructuresrehabilitated by local communities, thereby puttingthem back into operation.&#13;
 5.6.2.2    Description&#13;
 The program concerns the rehabilitation or reconstruction o f infrastructures damaged in the conflict. It&#13;
 covers healthcare, educational and transport infrastructures.The electricity sector i s addressedby the rural&#13;
 electrification component o f the ASER, particularly inthe departments o f Kolda and VClingara.&#13;
 5.6.2.2.1     Needs identified by the PRAESC&#13;
 The PRAESC document lists a set o f infrastructures in the areas o f transportation, health and education&#13;
 that require refurbishment so that economic and social activity can resume. These infrastructures have&#13;
beenranked, according to a methodology specific to each sector, inorder o f the urgency o f their repair.&#13;
&#13;
 0 Transportationsector&#13;
Inthe areaoftransportation, the PRAESChasidentified works valued at CFAF 11,063 million, directly&#13;
relating to periodic maintenance, rehabilitation or reconstruction o f roads inCasamance and some bridges&#13;
and works, includingtwo access bridges inthe town o f Kolda.&#13;
&#13;
(0E.~te-~al.access..~rz~~.~ement&#13;
Regarding external access, i.e., the linkage between Casamance and the rest o f Senegal, including the&#13;
option o f going eastward around The Gambia, the rehabilitation o f all national roads i s required, as i s that&#13;
o f the regional roads serving the main towns of departments.&#13;
Inthe area of maritime transport, the rehabilitation ofthe piers at the port of Ziguinchor may be deemed&#13;
sufficient for the short-term, pendingthe reconstruction o f the port with AFD financing, with the goal o f&#13;
attracting private investment for the acquisition o f additional vessels and the privatization o f the&#13;
management o f the vessel that i s to replace the capsized ferry the `Diola'. These investments are&#13;
essentially covered by ongoing national, bilateral or multilateral financing operations.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Inte-~.al.acces.s..!~o.~ement&#13;
Improved internal access is a matter o f connections between and within communities. Interms o f roads,&#13;
the main towns o f rural communities need to be made accessible; the program also involves the&#13;
rehabilitation o f feeder roads incertain pilot villages.&#13;
&#13;
(iii).Enhanced..access.i~l~.O~.~s~~.ated.-~e.a~&#13;
Roads serving rural border areas are to be rehabilitated in order to prevent these areas from being&#13;
exclusively geared to the production and consumption o f goods and services from neighboring countries,&#13;
and also to promote community transportation services using traditional pirogues and to foster improved&#13;
organization and safety o f services providing accessto the islands o f Basse Casamance.&#13;
Inthis connection, 6 woodenpontoonbridges are tobebuiltin6 islandvillages ofBasse Casamance(4&#13;
inthe Carones islands and 2 inthe Bandial area). The construction costs ofthese basic infiastructures are&#13;

 Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                      35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 covered under the PRAESC with a view to attracting private sector interest in the acquisition o f one or&#13;
 several river ferries.&#13;
&#13;
 0 Educationsector&#13;
 Inthe education sector, 138 classrooms have beenidentifiedas needingreconstruction. These classrooms&#13;
 are to be rebuilt over a three-year period. A margin o f 12 classrooms to be built was added to&#13;
 accommodate eventual changes in population density resulting from migrations due to the conflict. The&#13;
 estimated total cost is CFAF 750 million for the entire PRAESC, or CFAF 250 million each year for years&#13;
 1through 3.&#13;
&#13;
 0 Health sector&#13;
 Total investment under the PRAESC in the area o f health in Casamance totals CFAF 1,126 million,&#13;
 distributed equally over years 1through 3 of the PRAESC program. This sum corresponds to about 50&#13;
 healthposts, 3 matemity clinics and the rehabilitation o f the psychiatric center inKCnia.&#13;
 5.6.2.3   InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements&#13;
 5.6.2.3.1 Implementationstrategy of the InfrastructureReconstructionandRehabilitation&#13;
            Program(ProgrammedeReconstructionet deRihabilitation desInfrastructures, PRRI)&#13;
The PRAESC will not be directly involved in carrying out investment programs. On the contrary, it will&#13;
rely on the whole array o f programs supporting infrastructure investment that are already active in the&#13;
area, or even on delegated implementing agencies that are already operational.&#13;
 0 Transportsector&#13;
The program should be implemented within the framework o f convention between the Road Agency&#13;
(AATR) and the Ministries of Highways and Finance. For investment expenditures, includingthe CERSP&#13;
roads component, the agreement to be signed will either be for delegated works oversight or an&#13;
implementing agency contract, botho f which are provided for inthe future procedures manual.&#13;
0 Health andeducationsector&#13;
The CERSP will establish conventions or memoranda o f understanding with the Ministries o f Health and&#13;
Education, to which they will hand over the reconstructed or rehabilitated works. CERSP will delegate&#13;
works oversight to AGETIP which has an office inZiguinchor .&#13;
These reconstructions and rehabilitations will be contingent upon the actual availability o f teaching or&#13;
health staff for each o f them. The works will be requestedjointly by the health or education services and&#13;
beneficiary representatives. Contract management will then be contracted out to the regional office o f&#13;
AGETIF'.&#13;
Contracting for works oversight will be done locally. Labor-intensive techniques will be favored to&#13;
maximize positive impact on local populations.&#13;
5.6.2.3.2   Implementationstructure of the PRRI&#13;
The Direction de la Rkhabilitation des infrastructures (DRI)) will be responsible for developing&#13;
investment plans, establishing contracts for delegated implementing agencies and then for ensuring their&#13;
smooth implementation. In addition, the DRIwill rely on the joint services o f ANRAC, particularly for&#13;
procurement.&#13;
5.6.2.4   ImplementationRisks&#13;

 5.6.3   Preparation of the Long-Term RegionalDevelopment Program&#13;
 5.6.3.1   Objectives&#13;
 The objectives o f these activities are to identify, and then to study in depth, the future sustainable&#13;
 development themes speciJic to Casamance. This work should result in concrete proposals for the&#13;
 government of Senegal and its development partnersregarding interventions to be carried out.&#13;
 5.6.3.2  Description&#13;
 The selected areas o f investigation meet two simple criteria:&#13;
     0   They are crucial to sustainable development inCasamance;&#13;
     0   They are not an outgrowth o fnational sectoral policies and can be resolved by interventions at the&#13;
         level o f the natural region.&#13;
This latter point is important since Casamance suffers fiom problems common to all of Senegal. These&#13;
must be resolved at the countrywide level. The function o f the PRAESC is not to address these national&#13;
problems, muchless to launch activities aimed at resolving them inCasamance.&#13;
The specific areas are the following:&#13;
     0  enhancing accessibility o f Casamance;&#13;
        tourism;&#13;
        private sector promotion;&#13;
     0  environment and naturalresource management;&#13;
     0  hydraulics;&#13;
     0  landtenure.&#13;
5.6.3.3   InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements&#13;
The start-up of studies and other analytical activities for the formulation o f a sustainable development&#13;
program in Casamance must be supported by useful information gathered in connection with the system&#13;
o f early waming, and conflict-prevention. Activities will be carried out by the CEDLT under the&#13;
supervision o f the ProgramCoordinator.&#13;
5.6.3.4   ProcurementArrangements andActionPlan&#13;
Procurement will be handled by the CPM o f the ANRAC according to the manual o f administrative&#13;
procedure. Studies will be launched during the first year o f the CERSP so that they can be presented by&#13;
the DG-ANRAC to Senegal's development partners, who may then put together the recommended&#13;
programs at the end o f the thirdyear o f the CERSP.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  7.1    GENERAL&#13;
&#13;
  Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
  "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines for&#13;
  the Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the&#13;
  provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. A general description o f the various procurements i s&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 procurement will be done using the Bank's Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) for all ICB and National&#13;
 SBD agreedwith (or satisfactory to) theBank.&#13;
 Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include: Vehicles, motorcycles, office&#13;
 equipment, and computers. Procurement will be conducted using the Bank's SBD for all ICB and&#13;
National SBD as agreed with the Bank.&#13;

 OperationalCosts: operating costs covered under the Project would be financed inaccordance withthe&#13;
procedures o f ANRAC, which are satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
7.2    ASSESSMENT OFTHE IMPLEMENTINGAGENCY'S CAPACITY TO&#13;
       CONDUCT PROCUREMENT&#13;
&#13;
7.2.1 Procurement arrangements&#13;
Procurement activities would be handled by the Program Coordinator under the supervision o f a&#13;
Procurement specialist (SPM), including: (i)    preparation o f the General Procurement Notice and its&#13;
annual update; (ii) preparation o f the specific procurement notices; (iii)    preparation and update o f the&#13;
half-yearly procurement plans; (iv) drafting bidding documents and requests for proposals; (v) awarding&#13;
o f contracts and requests for IDA'Snon-objection when required; and (vi) drafting o f contracts and&#13;
ensuring that contracts are implemented properly.&#13;
Since ANRAC has no experience with World Bank procurement procedures, the project i s considered&#13;
highrisk.Consequently, agreement was reached on the following measures prior to Credit Effectiveness:&#13;
(i)recruitment o f a consultant to prepare the Project's administrative, accounting and financial&#13;
procedures; and (ii) recruitment o f the procurement specialist. These activities would be financed under&#13;
the Project PreparationFacility (PPF). The adoption o f a procedures manual satisfactory to IDA would be&#13;
a condition o f Credit effectiveness.&#13;
7.2.2   Assessment of the procurementunit&#13;
Because ANRAC staff has not yet beenrecruited, it was not possible to fully assesstheir capacities.&#13;
As soon as all the staff have been recruited, ANRAC will be evaluated to determine whether all&#13;
conditions are inplace to carry out procurement in accordance with World Bank procedures. The staff at&#13;
the ANRAC would include a Procurement Specialist familiar with World Bank procurement procedures&#13;
who would: (a) prepare and update the procurement plan for the project; (b) monitor the progress of&#13;
procurement; (c) assist the implementing agencies in the preparation o f bidding documents and bidding&#13;
announcements for goods and works contracts and requests for consultants' services; and (d) be&#13;
responsible for bid opening and evaluation. The Procurement Specialist will also advise the implementing&#13;
agencies on procedural matters. These conditions will be an important part o f the specialist's TOR and&#13;
contract, which i s to be drawn up with the assistance o f the World Bank's procurement team in&#13;
Washington and Dakar.&#13;
The overall project risk for procurement i s rated high until there i s sufficient evidence that procurement&#13;
has beenhandled satisfactorily.&#13;

&#13;
            8.      SECTIONG: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 8.1    GENERALREMARKS&#13;
&#13;
 The project's financial management arrangements are based on World Bank guidelines in this area, and&#13;
 particularly on "Guidelines: Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank"&#13;
 and "Guidelines for SimplifiedProcurement and Disbursement for Community-Based Investments". They&#13;
 also take into account the fiduciary arrangements o f World Bank projects inSenegal.&#13;
 Financial management o f the Project will be handled by the Director General o f ANRAC, who will&#13;
 delegate expenditure authorization functions to the Program Coordinator (Coordonnateur des&#13;
programmes, CP) based inZiguinchor. Accounting functions under the Project will be performed by the&#13;
Administration, Personnel and Finance Department (Service Administration, Personnel et Finances,&#13;
 SAPF) .&#13;
 Since this team i s not yet operational, the assessment o f financial management capacities consisted o f&#13;
defining the logistics o f implementing the financial management plan. This assessment therefore covered:&#13;
(i) resources; (ii)&#13;
    human                    accounting and financial procedures and periodic reporting; (iii)       audits;&#13;
(iv) disbursements; and (v) other specific arrangements giventhe nature ofthe project.&#13;
&#13;
8.2    ARRANGEMENTS FORFINANCIALAND ACCOUNTS MANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
8.2.1    Human resources&#13;
Interms of human resources, management of project accounts and finances will rely primarily on the&#13;
Administration, Personnel and Finance Department (SAPF). Terms o f reference for the head o f the SAPF&#13;
have been drawn up and recruitment o f this administrative and financial officer i s in progress. This&#13;
individualwill, like the team, be based inZiguinchor. He will be assisted by an accountant. One year after&#13;
project effectiveness, the work load will be evaluated in order to determine what reinforcement i s needed&#13;
at the central accounting and regional office levels.&#13;
Possible financing needs for activities in Dakar will be handled by the Directorate for Debt and&#13;
Investment (DDI) of the Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF), which will be responsible for&#13;
managingthe Special Account (see paragraph 8.2.4.1 on disbursement arrangements).&#13;
8.2.2   Accounting and financial management procedures and computerized management&#13;
         information system&#13;
A procedures manual now being developed will provide all the required details on accounting and&#13;
financial procedures. It will set out inparticular the flow o f accounting and financial informationbetween&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Senegal - CasamanceEmergencyReconstruction Support Project - MOP Technical Annex                         42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 the General Directorate o f ANRAC and project beneficiaries, as well as the modalities and formats o f&#13;
 periodic reports. An overview o f funding flows and cash management mechanisms i s provided in the&#13;
 paragraphon disbursements.&#13;
 Interms ofbudgets, eachyear the CP will, after consultation withthe other operationaldirectors, draw up&#13;
 a detailed budget for activities to be carried out under the CERSP. This budget, after its validation by the&#13;
 DG-ANRAC in a meeting o f the management committee, will be submitted to the World Bank for&#13;
 analysis and then to the CP-PRAESC for approval. It will then be incorporated into the general State&#13;
 budget submitted to the National Assembly for approval.&#13;
 The budget will be executed by the CP under the supervision of the DG-ANRAC. Thus, with regard to&#13;
 activities under the CERSP, the DG-ANRAC will delegate the relevant powers to the CP for the&#13;
 execution o f all activities approvedbythe CP-ANRAC. A monthly activity report will be producedby the&#13;
 CP and conveyed to the DG-ANRAC. This report will inparticular summarize the status o f financial and&#13;
 technical execution and the volume o fprocurement for the monthended, and will also contain forecasts.&#13;
 Every quarter, a Financial Monitoring Report (FMR) will be produced by the CP, validated by the DG-&#13;
 ANRAC, and conveyedto the WorldBank.&#13;
 Inthe area ofreporting, the CP will also be required to produce, no later than March 31 of the following&#13;
 fiscal year, annual statements o f accounting and financial execution. These financial statements will be&#13;
 subject to periodic audits (see paragraph on audits). Formats for the FMRs and financial statements will&#13;
be defined inthe procedures manual.&#13;
 The computerized information systemwill be set up in such a way as to furnish all o f the above data, in&#13;
 addition to providing analytical accounting for purposes o f monitoring beneficiaries, and particularly ex-&#13;
 combatants and target groups.&#13;
8.2.3    Audits&#13;
An annual audit o f ANRAC, including activities under the CERSP, and particularly those carried out by&#13;
the CP, will be conducted.&#13;
This audit will, on the one hand, be ofnormal scope interms o fproviding an opinion on annual financial&#13;
statements, and its scope will also be broadenedto cover the specific risks enumeratedbelow:&#13;
     (i)theactivitydescribedunderPhase3 (i.e., reinsertion) concerningthepaymentofatemporary&#13;
         safety net allowance. The auditor will be required to ensure that the payment procedures&#13;
         described inthe procedures manual have been observed and that the duly identified beneficiaries&#13;
         have received the funds to which they are entitled. The auditor will express a special opinion on&#13;
         this point;&#13;
     (ii)theactivitydescribedunderPhase4(i.e., reintegration)concerningspecifictrainingforre-entry&#13;
         into the workforce. The auditor will be required to express a special opinion on the training&#13;
         dispensed by the selected entities (NGOs or others), so that its effectiveness may be assessed.&#13;
Finally, it should be noted that the auditor will furnish, as an annex to ANRAC's financial statements, a&#13;
report on the implementation status o f activities under the CERSP that will in particular detail, by&#13;
category, funds receivedas well as executed and verified expenditures.&#13;
The audit report for the fiscal year ended must be submitted no later than June 30 following the end o f&#13;
that fiscal year.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
8.2.4    Proposeddisbursement arrangements&#13;
8.2.4.1    Disbursement methodand SpecialAccounts&#13;
The project will use the traditional disbursement method based on Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
This method will be used for an 18-month period, during which time the project will produce quarterly&#13;
FMRs.After 18 months, capacities will be assessed inorder to determine whether disbursements can be&#13;
basedupon FMRs.&#13;
 0 SpecialAccount:&#13;
A Special Account will be opened and management primarily by the Borrowers' designated&#13;
representative, who i s the main authorizer (ordonnateur) o f capital expenditures inSenegal.&#13;
The total allocation o fthis Special Account will be US$2 million equivalent and will cover approximately&#13;
four months o f expenditures. Upon credit effectiveness, the World Bank will deposit in this account an&#13;
advance representing 50 percent o f the initial allocation, or US$1million equivalent. The balance o f the&#13;
advance will be deposited when total expenditures plus special commitments are equal to SDR 3,000,000.&#13;
The Special Account will be used for all expenditures equivalent to less than 20 percent o f the authorized&#13;
allocation, and requests for reimbursement will be submitted monthly. Reimbursements deposited by the&#13;
Bank into this Special Account will be made against these requests supported by appropriate&#13;
documentation.&#13;
0 90-day advanceaccount:&#13;
Out o f this account, a documented 90-day advance not to exceed CFAF 50,000,000 will be deposited in&#13;
an account held by the CP o f the CERSP inZiguinchor. This 90-day advance account will be managed by&#13;
the CP, who will be the primary authorizer o f expenditures f?om it, and by the CSAPF, its accountant.&#13;
The CSAPF and CP will be the joint signers on this account. The 90-day advance account will be&#13;
reconciled on a monthly basis.&#13;
0 Useof Statementsof Expenditures (SOEs):&#13;
Disbursements for all expenditures will be made by the Bank against full documentation, with the&#13;
following exceptions: (a) contracts for works in an amount not exceeding US$500,000; (b) contracts for&#13;
goods in an amount not exceeding US$150,000; (c) consulting contracts in an amount not exceeding&#13;
US$lOO,OOO;    (d) contracts for individualconsultants inan amount not exceedingUS$50,000; and (e) cash&#13;
payments, training and operating costs, which will be reimbursed on the basis o f SOEs.&#13;
All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained at ANRAC and must be made available for&#13;
review by periodic WorldBank review missions and external auditors.&#13;
The schema o f funding flows will be describedinthe procedures manual and appended to the MOP as an&#13;
annex; it will also specify the various modes o f disbursement.&#13;
0 Disbursementsby category:&#13;
The table below sets out the expenditure categories to be financed out of the Credit proceeds. The&#13;
allocations for each expenditurecategory are the following:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 8.2.4.2   Counterpartfunds&#13;
 The Government must make all arrangements necessary to ensure the timely mobilization o f the&#13;
 counterpart funds needed for project implementation, and particularly for the operating and equipment&#13;
 expenditures o f the DG-ANRAC. An account will be opened inthe books o f the General Directorate for&#13;
 Public Accounts and Treasury to receive the counterpart funds. The DG-ANRAC will administer the&#13;
 Government's counterpart funds.&#13;
 The DG-ANRAC will open a regional account inZiguinchor to cover petty expenditures associated with&#13;
ProgramCoordination.&#13;
8.2.4.3    Other disbursement arrangements&#13;
The new Country Financing Parameters for Senegal (OP 600) adopted inJuly 30,2004 allows the funding&#13;
o f :&#13;
     0    the relocation expensesto the ex-combatants,&#13;
     0   the increase o f the disbursement percentage for the Operating Cost Category.&#13;
Regarding the second point, it has been stated that Counterpart Funds are not an issue in Senegal for Bank&#13;
funded operation. However, the mobilization o f counterpart funds for small expenditures and at the&#13;
decentralized level i s constraining. Thus the Bank agreed to increase the disbursement percentage for this&#13;
category up to 100%.Furthermore, the Counterpart Funds was increased accordingly to match the 10%.&#13;
8.2.5    Other financialmanagementarrangements&#13;
8.2.5.1    Relocationexpenseallowance for ex-combatants&#13;
A relocation expenses allowance is to be paid to ex-combatants (see description o f Phase 3 inparagraph&#13;
5.6.1.2), o f which CFAF 192,500 i s to be borne by the project. This amount will be paid out inthree equal&#13;
installments: the first at the time o f departure from the Demobilization Center, the second 3 to 4 months&#13;
later and the last 6 to 8 months after the departure.&#13;
Regarding the financial management arrangements, the CSAPFwill, after identification o f ex-combatants,&#13;
establish for each one a file, both electronic and physical, for payment and monitoring purposes. These&#13;
files must in particular contain the relevant identification papers and all documentary evidence o f&#13;
payments. Payments will be made through a commercial bank or through any other acceptable financial&#13;
intermediary (e.g., a funds transfer company or a micro-financing institution such as a cooperative,&#13;
savings bank or credit union.)&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Senegal - CasamanceEmergency Reconstruction Support Project - MOP TechnicalAnnex                        45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The CSAPF, in agreement with the CP, will identify the financial intermediaries closest to the project&#13;
areas and will proceed to assign ex-combatants to them for direct payment o f this expense allowance. An&#13;
agreement will be signed with these financial intermediaries specifying: (i) list o f beneficiaries as well&#13;
                                                                               the&#13;
as the required identity documents; (ii)   the modalities o f payment; (iii) modalities and deadlines for&#13;
                                                                            the&#13;
reporting on the execution o f payments.&#13;
The CSAPF will check the list of ex-combatants on aregular basis against the payment receipts. A report&#13;
will be prepared on this basis after each tranche and submittedto the World Bank. The validation o f this&#13;
report by the Project Officer will trigger the disbursement o f future tranches.&#13;
The Credit Agreement will include a `Grant' category to cover these payments. Expenditures under this&#13;
category will bereimbursed on a 100percent basis.&#13;
8.2.5.2   Supportfor reintegration&#13;
Support for reintegration will be provided during project implementation (see description o f Phase 4 in&#13;
paragraph 5.6.1.2). This support will be provided in accordance with the "Guidelines for Simplified&#13;
Procurement and Disbursement for Community-Based Investments". This support will be provided&#13;
through subprojects and will include training and capacity-building activities for reinsertion. It will&#13;
include the occasional purchase o f small equipment.&#13;
A detailed description will be provided inthe administrative, accountingand financial procedures manual.&#13;

&#13;
   Inthe absenceofreliable data onthe impact ofthe conflict onthe economies of Senegal and Casamance,&#13;
   it is currently impossible to calculate any economic rate of return for the PRAESC. It is obvious,&#13;
   however, that the development o f Casamance would be seriously compromised without such a program.&#13;
   The lack o f aid for the demobilization o f MFDC combatants would, inthe best case, cause some o f them&#13;
   to resort to banditry and civil violence, and at worst could re-ignite aspirations to achieve independence&#13;
   byviolent means.&#13;
   Similarly, failure to conduct mine clearance activities would amount to allowing a large part o f the land&#13;
   area o f Casamance's two regions to remain devoid of human presence, whereas these areas were an&#13;
   important source o frevenue for the population prior to the conflict.&#13;
   Finally, a minimum o f upgrading o f essential infrastructures, at the community level as well as at the&#13;
   higher levels, i s essential for economy recovery.&#13;
   Inorder to have an exact ideaofthese opportunity costs, anin-depth study wouldberequired.&#13;
   Itis also important to point out that unless this local conflict is resolved, the neighboring countries ofThe&#13;
   Gambia and Guinea-Bissau couldbecome even more unstable than they already are.&#13;

            Senegal - Casamance Emergency
            Reconstruction Support Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Casamance Emergency Reconstruction
            Support Project aims to support the Government of Senegal
            in: (a) facilitating a speedy restoration in Casamance of a
            productive economic and social environment similar to that
            existing in the rest of Senegal; and (b) laying the
            groundwork for sustainable long-term development in the
            region, while fully respecting its specificities. To achieve
            its objectives, the project will have three components: (1)
            demobilization and reinsertion of combatants and other
            conflict victims; (2) infrastructure reconstruction and
            rehabilitation; and (3) technical support for the
            preparation o f a long-term development program. In
            addition, the National Agency for the Recovery o f Social
            and Economic Activities in Casamance (ANRAC) will directly
            implement other cross-cutting activities, such as
            instituting a management information system. The project
            will benefit Senegal as a whole and the Casamance region in
            particular. All ex-combatants and their families will be
            offered opportunities to resume normal civilian lives with
            appropriate economic activities. Approximately 30,000
            displaced persons will be supported in their return to
            normal life in their original homes. After project
            completion, Casamance is expected to be an exporter of
            agricultural products abroad and a supplier to the local
            Senegalese market. Significant foreign direct investment in
            the tourism sector should also occur once regional stability
            is secured. External risks to the project include: 1. A
            full-scale rebellion because of disagreements between the
            Rebellion Movement in Casamance (MFDC) and the Government;
            and repeated attacks staged by gangs of former combatants.
            Project risks comprise the following: 1) Poor coordination
            among the various efforts taking place in Casamance; 2) Lack
            of collaboration/trust between the administration and the
            beneficiaries.; 3) Slowness of implementation and
            disbursement; and 4) Inability of displaced persons to
            return to their original homes.
