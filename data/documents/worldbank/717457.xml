government and the Malaysian sponsors of another private power project. Now that this&#13;
dispute is being resolved, preparation of the proposed Songo Songo project has resumed. The&#13;
World Bank's support for the Currency Convertibility Fund is not due to go before the Bank's&#13;
board for approval until 2000. Still, the fund may be a replicable mechanism that, by mitigating&#13;
sovereign risks that investors are unwilling to bear and unable to hedge against, could help&#13;
catalyze foreign equity investment in other IDA countries and in projects that generate local&#13;

        <abstracts>
            A proposed Currency Convertibility Fund,
            backstopped by a contingent credit from the International
            Development Association (IDA)-the World Bank's
            concessionary window for the world's poorest
            countries-has been designed for the Songo Songo Gas
            Development and Power Generation Project in Tanzania. The
            fund is a transitional mechanism aimed at supporting the
            Tanzanian government's efforts to attract foreign
            equity in circumstances where the private sector perceives a
            high level of risk and is otherwise unwilling to invest. The
            fund may be a replicable mechanism that, by mitigating
            sovereign risks that investors are unwilling to bear and
            unable to hedge against, could help catalyze foreign equity
            investment in other IDA countries and in projects that
            generate local currency.
