TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
0.1    Chapter 1 presents the country background to place the proposed project in the context of past and&#13;
current economic adjustment. Chapter 2 presents the transport sector institutional assessment. Chapter 3&#13;
describes the reform program prepared by the Government, as of mid-1995, to address the issues identified&#13;
in the sector institutional assessment. The chapter also presents the sector investment program, provides&#13;
the reform and investment programs' benefits and risks, including those related to environment, and the&#13;
programs implementation arrangements. Chapter 4 proposes the IDA's assistance strategy to the transport&#13;
sector in Cameroon based on lessons learned from Bank Group involvement in Cameroon. Chapter 5 lists&#13;
the agreements reached. Figures in the report derive from studies carried out to prepare the project.&#13;
1. COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Throughout the 1970s and until 1985, Cameroon registered an average real growth rate of about 8&#13;
percent per annum. Production of oil, which accounted for about 45 percent of Government revenues, was&#13;
a major factor of growth. Three external shocks, starting in 1985-1986, revealed the fragility of the oil-&#13;
dependent economy: decline in external terms of trade (coffee, cocoa and oil), depreciation of the dollar,&#13;
and decline in oil production. As a result, the economy and living standards started to deteriorate in 1986-&#13;
87. Per capita income declined by 55 percent between 1986 and 1993. The population living in poverty&#13;
increased from 40 percent of households in 1983 to 48 percent in 1993. To reverse this decline, the&#13;
Government launched a first Structural Adjustment Program in 1989 supported by a World Bank&#13;
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL1, Ln. 3089-CM, June 1989). In the absence of a real depreciation of the&#13;
CFA franc, however, these efforts proved ineffective. As a result, the economy contracted by an average&#13;
5.3 percent per annum between 1990-91 and 1992-93. Per capita income decreased by an average 8.6&#13;
percent per annum over the same period.&#13;
1.2   The CFAF devaluation in January 1994 created a pre-condition for the resumption of positive real&#13;
growth and an improvement in the country's external competitiveness. In parallel, the Government&#13;
implemented the Central Africa Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC) tax and tariff reform to simplify&#13;
the tariff structure and eliminate all remaining quantitative restrictions on merchandises imports. However,&#13;
without deepening of the adjustment effort, the economy did not fully benefit from the devaluation. As a&#13;
result, Cameroon's long-term development has continued to be plagued by three main constraints: (a) a&#13;
fiscal crisis with inadequate resource mobilization, poor quality of public expenditure and a crippling&#13;
internal debt; (b) an external debt overhang with, in 1994, the external debt service accounting for 63&#13;
percent of total Government revenues, or, taking into account payment arrears, total debt service&#13;
accounting for 111 percent of Government revenues; and (c) uneven ownership and commitment to the&#13;
adjustment agenda.&#13;
1.3   Since early 1995, the Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to reverse past trends.&#13;
All outstanding undertakings agreed under the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) financed by IDA and due&#13;
for implementation by December 1995 have been completed. The Head of State announced additional&#13;
adjustment measures such as: (a) acceleration of the privatization program including utilities; (b)&#13;
improvement of the privatization procedure under the auspices of a committee at the Presidency responsible&#13;
for ensuring transparency; (c) making the preshipment inspection company responsible for customs duties&#13;
assessments and monitoring of actual collection; and (d) imposition of sanctions on civil servants guilty of&#13;
corruption or embezzlement. In line with IDA or IMF concems, the FY96 Finance Law contains a series&#13;
of revenue-raising measures as well as increased budget allocations to development sectors such as&#13;
education and health. As a result, the IMF concluded negotiations of its Standby Agreement. A letter of&#13;
intent was signed on August 1995. A new Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) in the amount of US$150&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

million was approved by the Board of the Association on February 8, 1996, and became effective on&#13;
February 22, 1996.&#13;
2. TRANSPORT SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
2.1    This chapter assesses the transport sector issues as identified in the Transport Sector Strategy&#13;
Memorandum (Report No. 11430-CM, June 30, 1993) with data updated as of fiscal year 94. The&#13;
memorandum was prepared after long discussions with public and private sector stakeholders and its&#13;
recommendations were the basis of the transport sector reform program adopted by the Government in&#13;
1995 and presented in Chapter 3. Since the report was completed, the Government has started to&#13;
restructure the transport sector and has launched several actions. These recent developments have not been&#13;
taken into account in the following description of the transport sector issues to maintain consistency with&#13;
the reform program presented in Chapter 3 as well as for the sake of comparing 1993 and 1995 and&#13;
evidencing the Government commitment to the reform of the transport sector.&#13;
2.2    Overall Sector Performance. Weak management of institutions and an unsatisfactory regulatory&#13;
framework have caused the transport sector to have a major negative impact on the overall economy,&#13;
especially for the poor for which poor transport infrastructure has become one of the major impediment to&#13;
their participation in economic development. The Government gave priority to investment and to protection&#13;
of PEs. As a result, transport infrastructure has lacked maintenance and PEs have drained scarce State&#13;
resources. The consequences are a lack of competitiveness within the transport sector, the running down of&#13;
existing assets, and a lack of resources for investment.&#13;
2.3   Impact on the Poor. Improvement of transport infrastructure, particularly main roads and farm-&#13;
to-market roads, was one of the priority actions identified during the national workshop on poverty held in&#13;
Cameroon in November 1994. In the South-West province, 86 percent of the people interviewed during the&#13;
Participatory Poverty Analysis (PPA) carried out in 1994 indicated that poor transport was the major cause&#13;
of poverty. Many of the problems of the poor were found to be compounded by the limited or non-existent&#13;
road infrastructure which cut off many villages or make some inaccessible for up to four months during the&#13;
rainy season, which is the time of high agricultural activity (Figure 1). Limited mobility, especially in rural&#13;
areas, greatly reduces inter-village and ruraL/urban trade and commerce. The absence of efficient&#13;
communication facilities in their regions in general means that the poor have to pay proportionally higher&#13;
prices for travel.&#13;
2.4    Physical isolation also is a factor of economic and social isolation. Women in a village on a main&#13;
road with direct access to wholesalers were able to spend more time producing food to sell and made an&#13;
average income of US$570, more than twice the US$225 income earned by women in an isolated village&#13;
located 1.5 hours from the main road. Poor transport infrastructure makes access of women to transport&#13;
even more out of step with their transport responsibilities embedded in the gender division of labor.&#13;
2.5    Poor transport infrastructure also contributes to food insecurity in poor rural areas by hampering&#13;
movements between areas of surplus and areas of shortage, as well as making transportation costs so high&#13;
that movements in relative prices required to stimulate the transport of food to areas of shortage become so&#13;
large that many of the poor in afflicted regions cannot afford marketed food. During the PPA survey, a&#13;
respondent who sells foodstuffs in the Northern province pointed out that plantains selling for CFAF 500 in&#13;
Yaounde would cost CFAF 2,000 in Maroua, due principally to transportation costs. Poor urban transport&#13;
infrastructure is also a major constraint for the poor who have to walk on long distances to access urban&#13;
transport services in addition to the proportionally higher prices for travel that they have to pay to use these&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;

2.6    Weak Sector Management and Institutions. Sector ministries are overstaffed and have interfered&#13;
negatively with PE management and decisions on staffing, operations and investments. The Government&#13;
institutions involved are the Ministry of Public Works (MINTP), with about 6,700 employees, and the&#13;
Ministry of Transport (MINT), with about 880 employees. MINTP runs an inefficient, unaccountable&#13;
road maintenance system driven by force account. MINT's role is to oversee transport PEs, but instead, it&#13;
has interfered with their management, hindering both their autonomy and performance. MINT initiates and&#13;
supervises regulations for road, rail, air, and transit and maritime transport. It also oversees the Shippers'&#13;
Council (CNCC), which controls the distribution of Cameroon's maritime traffic under the United Nations&#13;
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)'s Code of Conduct (40-40-20), negotiates liner&#13;
conference tariffs, and represents Cameroonian shippers' interests.&#13;
2.7    The functions of the Directorate of Large Works of Cameroon (DGTC), which has about 110&#13;
employees, overlap with those of the other sector institutions. DGTC is a public enterprise under the&#13;
tutelage of the Prime Ministry. DGTC serves as a secretariat to the National Tender Board on&#13;
procurement decisions. Until the 1994 restructuring, it also prepared and supervised large works, including&#13;
road civil works. DGTC has given priority to investment to the detriment of maintenance. Road&#13;
investment has not been coordinated between DGTC and MINTP. DGTC has not achieved its objectives&#13;
of reducing construction costs and making enterprises comply with contractual time stipulations. The&#13;
Government has not allocated resources to DGTC since 1993. DGTC's revenues have derived from civil&#13;
works contracts, which caused lack of transparency and conflict of interest. In March 1994, DGTC's debt&#13;
to suppliers, employees, the Social Security Fund and the Government amounted to US$3.5 million. The&#13;
country procurement review carried out by IDA in 1993, qualified the local procurement procedures as&#13;
critically deficient because of little transparency in bid evaluation and award of contracts, resulting in long&#13;
procurement processing and high costs.  In June 1995, the Government adopted a new national&#13;
procurement code in consultation with IDA and procurement procedures have been decentralized. Technical&#13;
ministries and PEs are autonomous for procurement activities below about US$1 million equivalent for&#13;
works, US$0.6 million for goods, and US$0.4 million for consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                    Transport Sector Project&#13;
2.8    Unsatisfactory Regulatory Framework.  The current framework is an obstacle to effective&#13;
competition in some transport subsectors:&#13;
(a)    Civil Aviation: Although the regulatory framework is overall satisfactory, its provisions&#13;
are not applied consistently. The Government intervenes in CAMAIR's operational&#13;
management. Other domestic companies were authorized in 1994 to operate regular or&#13;
charter flights within Cameroon and between Camneroon and neighboring countries, but the&#13;
Govemment is unwilling to allow competition between these companies and CAMAIR.&#13;
Regional and international air cargo services are not developed, although the market does&#13;
exist. High aviation fuel prices in Cameroon due to local taxes impede civil aviation&#13;
development.&#13;
(b)   Interurban Road Transport: A bureau of freight was created in 1994 to control the&#13;
distribution of transit traffic to Chad and the Central African Republic between&#13;
Cameroonian, Chadian and Central African transporters. The Shippers' Council, the&#13;
railway company and the road transport associations participate in the bureau. This is&#13;
likely to reduce sector efficiency and increase transport costs. The road taxation system is&#13;
complex and cumbersome, with about 15 taxes collected at different stages, by different&#13;
institutions. Tax revenues are insufficient. Road transport benefits from the price structure&#13;
for petroleum products which does not promote competition and does not encourage&#13;
petroleum companies to use the least-cost mode of transport. The regulation to control axle&#13;
loads is not applied. Road insecurity increases.&#13;
(c)    Maritime transport: The negotiations of tariffs between shipping lines and the shippers'&#13;
council have kept tariffs at the same official level for several years, although they have&#13;
decreased in the rest of the world on average by an annual 4 percent between 1980 and&#13;
1992, and by an annual 7 percent since 1989. These negotiations and confidential rebates&#13;
proposed by the shipping lines result in lack of transparency in the transport market. The&#13;
current regulation protects the national shipping lines, and its application causes delays&#13;
and increases costs of international maritime transport, thereby impeding the country's&#13;
competitiveness. A background note on maritime transport regulation in sub-Saharan&#13;
countries can be found in the Technical Annex of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) of the&#13;
Transport Sector Technical Assistance Credit (SAR No. P-6559-CM) presented to the&#13;
Board on April 11, 1995.&#13;
2.9    Non-Performing Transport Sector Public Enterprises. Seven PEs are under the jurisdiction of&#13;
MINT: the national airline (CAMAIR), with about 1,600 employees; the railway company&#13;
(REGIFERCAM) with about 3,600 employees, operating about 1,000 km of railways; the urban bus&#13;
company (SOTUC) with about 1,050 employees, operating bus lines in Yaounde and Douala until&#13;
February 1995; the national shipping line (CAMSHIP) with about 270 employees, including 80 sailors; the&#13;
national freight forwarder and road transport company (CAMTAINER) with about 200 employees; the&#13;
National Port Authority (ONPC) with about 1,000 employees, managing Cameroon's main port at Douala&#13;
and three secondary ports, and the national dockyard (CNIC) with about 130 employees, operating a&#13;
maritime workshop and dry-dock. Two PEs fall under the jurisdiction of MINTP: the equipment pool for&#13;
road maitenance (MATGENIE) with about 400 employees, and the road laboratory (LABOGENIE) with&#13;
about 440 employees, which controls the norms and standards of road and building construction, and&#13;
carries out research.&#13;
2.10   Six out of nine transport sector PEs are bankrupt and drain huge resources from the State budget.&#13;
The transport sector PEs' debts and arrears severely constrain the State Treasury. At the end of FY93,&#13;
direct subsidies needed to cover transport PEs' deficit amounted to US$55 million, equivalent to 8 percent&#13;
of the State revenues. About US$240 million of subsidies had been allocated to transport sector PEs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 2 - Transport Sector Institutional Assessment                                        5&#13;
between FY90 and FY92, of which 84 percent to CAMAIR. As of 1994, the total domestic debt for the&#13;
nine sector PEs amounted to CFAF 122 billion, US$236 million equivalent (Table 1). This accounted for&#13;
about 24 percent of the total debt of the 34 major PEs in Carneroon, 6 percent of the total domestic debt&#13;
and 3 percent of the gross domestic product. REGIFERCAM, CAMSHIP and SOTUC are the most&#13;
important debtors to the State among transport PEs. Transport PEs owe US$74 million to the State, which&#13;
accounts for 19 percent of the total PE debt due to the State. SOTUC, MATGENIE, ONPC and&#13;
LABOGENIE are the most important creditors of the State among transport PEs. The State owes US$93&#13;
million to these enterprises which accounts for 22 percent of the total State's debt due to PEs.&#13;

2.11   In 1993/94, CAMAIR had an estimated debt of about US$78 million, with arrears of about&#13;
US$55 mnillion, and a negative net worth of US$20 million, against assets of US$50 million. On the basis&#13;
of projected operating losses and debt service requirements, the company would need an annual US$10&#13;
rmillion subsidy to continue, and still be unable to renew its equipment when it reaches the end of its&#13;
economic life in five years. Financial and operational management is poor and lacks transparency. Fraud&#13;
is widespread. The company is overstaffed by about 800 employees. CAMAIR operates one B-747, and&#13;
two short haul carriers (B-737) for regional and domestic flights, after one crashed in 1995.&#13;
2.12   Several attempts to restructure the company failed because the Government interfered with&#13;
management, in particular with respect to staffing decision. The company maintains the presidential fleet&#13;
without being paid for the service, and civil servants use CAMAIR without the Government paying for all&#13;
tickets. The agreements under the performance contract concluded between the Government and CAMAIR&#13;
as part of the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL1) conditionalities were largely unfulfilled. The agreement&#13;
to prepare a sale and lease-back arrangement for CAMAIR's long haul carrier (B-747), signed by the&#13;
Minister of Finance under the SAL, was rescinded by the President of Cameroon. Despite the appointment,&#13;
in October 1992, of a Director-General from Air France, which is a minority shareholder (25 percent), the&#13;
situation has started only recently to improve, thanks to the devaluation of the CFAF franc. Since 1992,&#13;
when Air France purchased UTA, the former French airline which serviced Cameroon, Air France's&#13;
participation and technical assistance entail a conflict of interest as the airline competes with CAMAIR on&#13;
the Douala-Paris line.&#13;
2.13   REGIFERCAM's long-term debt (mostly in foreign currency) stood at about US$75 million&#13;
equivalent on June 30, 1994. Arrears to various bilateral donors, suppliers, and local banks amount to&#13;
about US$40 million equivalent. Arrears to the Social Security system amount to about US$15 million.&#13;
During FY93, the enterprise incurred an operating loss, before subsidies, of about US$20 million (down&#13;
from about US$52 mnillion in 1988). Growth of log and timber traffic in 1994 has improved the cash-flow&#13;
situation but the long-term situation remains the same because of the importance of the debt. The company&#13;
plays an important role in domestic freight and transit transport. Logs, wheat and flour, petroleum&#13;
products, cotton, and transit goods are the largest items using railway services. The construction of the&#13;
pipe line between Chad and Cameroon should boost rail transport during the next two years. In addition,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                    Transport Sector Project&#13;
the company provides passenger services to and from Northern Cameroon (at 620 km from Yaounde and&#13;
880 km from Douala), which is linked to other regions by an earth road in poor condition.&#13;
2.14   The company made substantial efforts within the framework of the performance contract signed&#13;
with the Government under the SAL in 1989. The management has been more commercially oriented and&#13;
has full autonomy to set tariffs and negotiate contracts. The number of employees was reduced from 6,350&#13;
to about 3,600. REGIFERCAM concluded agreements with the State on compensation for operating&#13;
unprofitable passenger transport services under public service obligations. Some auxiliary activities were&#13;
privatized. But Govemment still interferes with some management and procurement decisions, therefore&#13;
limiting the potential for further efforts which would be required in view of the still weak financial situation&#13;
of the company.&#13;
2.15   SOTUC, which owned 229 buses (107 in Yaounde and 122 in Douala), has been unprofitable&#13;
since its creation. In 1994, only about half of its buses were operational, and this number was rapidly&#13;
dwindling because of lack of maintenance. In FY93, SOTUC's net loss amounted to about US$7 million&#13;
equivalent, with a tumover of US$4 million. By June 30, 1993, its negative net worth amounted to about&#13;
US$56 million equivalent, against assets with a book value of US$12 million. Its arrears to banks,&#13;
employees, suppliers, the Treasury, and the Social Security system amounted to about US$45 million. The&#13;
Govermment's policy of maintaining a high number of staff, insisting on operating uneconomic routes, and&#13;
setting preferential tariffs for certain segments of the population has been the principal cause of SOTUC's&#13;
failure. It would have cost the State about US$7 million annually to continue operating SOTUC over the&#13;
next few years. A perfomance contract signed under the SAL was never implemented. In 1994, because&#13;
salaries had not been paid for more than one year, the company had been de facto taken over by its&#13;
employees who ran the buses for their own account.&#13;
2.16   In 1993, SOTUC's market share was less than 5 percent of total urban transport, which is very&#13;
low compared, for example, to 22 percent in Conakry and 41 percent in Abidjan for similar public bus&#13;
transport. The police and military accounted for 28 percent of SOTUC's passengers, but only 8 percent of&#13;
its revenues. Students also paid reduced fares or no fare at all. The Govemment never fully compensated&#13;
SOTUC for the deficit caused by public service. Between 1986 and 1991, passenger volume dropped from&#13;
152,000 per day to 44,000, a decline of 70 percent in five years. Most urban trips were then done by&#13;
private vehicles, by taxis or by foot. Until 1994, the taxi fleet was estimated at about 5,000 in Yaounde&#13;
and 5,500 in Douala. It is now shrinking and the condition of vehicles is deteriorating quickly after the&#13;
devaluation. Transport tariffs cannot be increased because the revenue per capita decreased significantly&#13;
following salary reductions in 1993. The cost of spare parts and new vehicles is now too expensive for&#13;
owners to maintain or renew the fleet. The share of the population walking is now estimated at around 40&#13;
percent.&#13;
2.17   CAMSHIP is recovering from several years of poor efficiency and weak management due to&#13;
political interference. Until FY89, CAMSHIP made profits of about US$6 million on sales of about&#13;
US$80 million. In 1991, its operating loss reached US$4.4 million, which increased to US$6 million&#13;
before taxes in 1992. Its working capital was negative by US$1 million in 1991. CAMSHIP owns two&#13;
vessels and charters ships for petroleum and clinker. In June 1993, net equity stood at below 75 percent of&#13;
the company's initial capital, thus implying bankruptcy. The company's liquidation value was estimated at&#13;
US$20 million in 1993, below its cash-flow of US$32 million, calculated on a net present value basis of 20&#13;
years at the 20 percent annual interest rate prevailing in Cameroon.&#13;
2.18   CAMSHIP's debt was substantially restructured in an amount of US$21 million in a convention&#13;
concluded with the State in September 1993. The Government agreed to: (a) transfer to the State the&#13;
additional US$11 million debt incurred in the purchase, arranged by the Government, of two vessels at&#13;
above market value; and (b) reschedule over eight years the remaining bilateral debt due by CAMSHIP,&#13;
and assume that debt. As a result, the June 30, 1995, balance sheet shows a profit. However, this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 2 - Transport Sector Institutional Assessment                                 7&#13;
agreement was not signed by the private shareholders of CAMSHIP, who do not agree to participate in the&#13;
capital increase as intended in the agreement. In addition, the company remains burdened by its lead share&#13;
(27 percent, US$2.6 million) in a real estate holding (SIMAR) created by the Government to build a&#13;
maritime office building, which has substantial arrears on its mortgage payments (US$13 million). The&#13;
mortgage banks could call the entire loan balance. Besides being a financial burden on the State Treasury,&#13;
the company impacts adversely on the maritime sector's efficiency and competitiveness and on the country's&#13;
economy. This is because application of quotas to shippers under the UNCTAD's Code of Conduct results&#13;
in high transport costs due to the absence of competition between shipping lines servicing Cameroon. In&#13;
addition, delays in transport operations arise from cumbersome procedures created by the efforts of&#13;
Cameroonian authorities to allocate its full quota of traffic to CAMSHIP. The Government considers that&#13;
the presence of CAMSHIP increases competition.&#13;
2.19   CAMTAINER is heavily leveraged with an 87/13 debt/equity ratio, and has insufficient revenues&#13;
to meet debt service obligations. As a result of competition with other companies and its overdesign at its&#13;
creation, CAMTAINER has been unable to recover the cost of the initial investment and is unprofitable. In&#13;
early-1995, its foreign partners (45% German and Danish institutional investors) agreed to debt-relief to&#13;
improve the company's cash-flow.&#13;
2.20   ONPC breaks even, but at much too high costs and tariffs, and without providing efficient&#13;
services. Expenditures are estimated at one third above the normal level for the services rendered, because&#13;
of overstaffing and past over-investment. ONPC's management lacks both autonomy and accountability.&#13;
ONPC has been unable to maintain the access channel, whose depth was reduced from 7.2 m after&#13;
rehabilitation in 1989, to 5.4 m in 1992. Until 1995, the investment policy was not based on financial&#13;
return and capacity to service the debt. ONPC was considering an unrealistic five-year US$275 million&#13;
investment program, the equivalent of 40% of overall Government investment, to finance a new dredger, a&#13;
new container terminal, the rehabilitation of the channel and construction of calibration dikes, the&#13;
rehabilitation of the Douala port infrastructure, the renovation of secondary ports, and the construction of&#13;
two deep-sea ports. This plan was supported by the Government for political reasons, but the financing&#13;
was not available for its most important components. In FY93, salaries increased by 12 percent, although&#13;
port traffic remained the same than in FY92.&#13;
2.21   ONPC's tariffs are set arbitrarily and do not reflect costs. The implementation of the analytical&#13;
accounting system and the management information system, which would provide the basis for a more&#13;
accurate calculation of tariffs, has incurred long delays and is not yet completed. ONPC increased its&#13;
tariffs for ships up to 300 percent after devaluation, and intends to increase its other tariffs on goods.&#13;
ONPC revenues totaled US$33 million after devaluation, down from US$48 million before devaluation,&#13;
and were obtained from ships (piloting, tug boat services, occupation of berth space) for about US$18&#13;
million, from goods for US$8 million, from renting-out warehouses and port space for about US$6 million,&#13;
and from non-port activities, such as the production and sale of ice, utilities and other items. The net&#13;
operating income ranged between slightly positive and slightly negative during the FY89-94 period.&#13;
However, until 1993, ONPC experienced serious liquidity shortages due to partial transfers of port&#13;
revenues from the Treasury to ONPC on port dues collected by customs. A substantial portion of ONPC's&#13;
costs were derived from short-term bank lending to cover the shortfall, amounting to about 30 percent of&#13;
ONPC's revenues. At the end of 1993, the Ministry of Economy and Finance agreed to let ONPC collect&#13;
these revenues itself.&#13;
2.22   CNIC is subsidized by using the dry-dock without amortizing it in its accounts, and not paying a&#13;
lease to the State as the owner. It is reasonably well managed, but tends to seek Government's assistance&#13;
and favored treatment for work orders. Its development plan is not consistent with its financial capacity to&#13;
service the debt, and CNIC expects the Government to cover the financing gap. In 1994, CNIC's tariffs&#13;
became more competitive because of the devaluation. The balance sheet has continually improved since the&#13;
creation of the dockyard, and showed profits for FY94.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                    Transport Sector Project&#13;
2.23   MATGENIE has faced a liquidity crisis for several years because of accumulating Government&#13;
debts for services rendered in road construction and maintenance. In 1993, the Government's outstanding&#13;
debt amounted to US$25 million. The company was overstaffed by about one third. Unpaid salaries for&#13;
more than one year led to low morale and strikes. The Government and MATGENIE's management took&#13;
measures to improve the situation in 1994, when a new manager was appointed and a restructuring plan&#13;
prepared. The plan was implemented in September 1994 with a new administrative chart and staff&#13;
reduction by about 50 percent, equivalent to 40 percent of the total salary bill. Also, the management&#13;
reduced salaries by 10 percent in January 1995.&#13;
2.24   Although LABOGENIE monopolized defacto road laboratory works in Cameroon until recently,&#13;
its financial performance has deteriorated. Arrears from the Government, which was the only client,&#13;
amount to US$7 million. Due to external donor pressure, the market was opened to competition, and&#13;
LABOGENIE has benefited from externally-financed contracts, reducing its dependency on Government&#13;
financing. However, the volume of road construction works has severely decreased, thereby strengthening&#13;
the need for restructuring the company. Although LABOGENIE's staff was reduced from 821 to 526 in&#13;
1991 and 443 in 1996, the company remains overstaffed. With the Bank's assistance under the Sixth&#13;
Highway Project (Loan 2584-CM), financial management and commercial orientation have improved.&#13;
2.25  Investnents Opportunities Poorly Apprehended. Sector investments were oversized and did not&#13;
take recurrent costs into account. The Public Investment Program (PIP) has not reflected sector priorities&#13;
or been based on economic criteria and availability of local funds. For example, a new airport built in&#13;
Yaound6 for 1.5 million passengers per year is used by less than 100,000 passengers. In Maroua, the&#13;
airport's rehabilitation is incomplete due to a lack of funds. Meanwhile, the main airport in Douala, with&#13;
about 400,000 passengers per year, is not maintained and is deteriorating. In 1992-1993, the Government&#13;
sought financing for a new four-lane expressway between Yaounde and the new airport, while it lacked the&#13;
funds to maintain the road network. Until 1995, the port authority of Douala gave priority to the&#13;
modernization of the container terminal with expensive, sophisticated cranes, while the access channel to&#13;
the port was insufficiently dredged. A 6 billion CFA dry-yard, purchased in 1988, is used well below its&#13;
capacity because the demand for ship repair is low, and the dry-yard is located in shallow waters which&#13;
limit its operating capacity. Finally, several investments in the transport sector were begun but not&#13;
completed for lack of financing, resulting in the loss of what had been executed.&#13;
2.26  Insufficient Maintenance of Existing Infrastructure. During the past ten years, priority given to&#13;
investments has resulted in neglect of transport infrastructure maintenance. In addition, several weaknesses&#13;
hamper maintenance:&#13;
(a)    Poor management. Procedures do not exist to establish consistent annual objectives and&#13;
monitor the performance of maintenance units. This results in inefficient use of force&#13;
account for routine and periodic road maintenance, and the maintenance of the access&#13;
channel to the port of Douala.&#13;
(b)    Weak institutions. The institutional framework has never encouraged accountability&#13;
within the institutions responsible for maintenance, nor from these institutions to the&#13;
Government, nor from the Government to infrastructure users beyond the budget&#13;
procedure.&#13;
(c)    Poor funding procedures. The local budget for road maintenance is insufficient due to the&#13;
State budget crisis which barely allows for payment of salaries to civil servants. The port&#13;
does not have a specific funding procedure for the maintenance of the channel and gives&#13;
priority to the payment of salaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 2 - Transport Sector Institutional Assessment                                 9&#13;
(d)   Inadequate donor strategy. Until recently, donor assistance focused on investments rather&#13;
than maintenance.&#13;
2.27   Although ONPC's (National Port Authority) dredging crew has technical capacity, the current&#13;
institutional framework in which ONPC's dredging departrnent operates, and the technical constraints of its&#13;
dredger, make it impossible for ONPC to satisfactorily perform such dredging. The dredging performance&#13;
has rapidly declined since 1988 when the contract with foreign expertise was terminated. This contract&#13;
provided for rehabilitation and maintenance of the 22 km long access channel through the Wouri river,&#13;
from the sea to the port of Douala. Heavy siltation of the Wouri river has reduced the depth of the channel&#13;
from -7.5 m after rehabilitation, to about -5.4 m at the end of 1992. Shipping lines are forced to enter and&#13;
depart with reduced loads, and to spend costly idle time at the quay or at the channel entrance awaiting high&#13;
tides. CAMSHIP's vessels depart with about 3,000 tons below load capacity. In 1993 and 1994,&#13;
following the dredger's overhaul and donor pressure, the channel depth was increased to about -5.9 m, but&#13;
is still well below the minimum of -6.5 m needed for satisfactory port performance.&#13;
2.28   The low productivity of road maintenance is caused by inefficient planning and management, slow&#13;
budgeting and payment procedures, non performiing force account teams, defective equipment and, for the&#13;
past three years, a lack of financing. MINTP has insufficient knowledge of the status of the road network&#13;
or the actual cost of maintenance. The 4,054 km of paved road network is mosdy in fair condition because&#13;
it is relatively recent and has been well maintained with German assistance until 1992, but is now&#13;
beginning to deteriorate. The 17,289 km-long earth road network is now mostly in poor to very poor&#13;
condition. During FY93, only some 6,000 km of roads were maintained, while maintenance almost ceased&#13;
in FY94. In 1990-1991, the availability rate of equipment leased by MATGENIE to the Department of&#13;
Highway Maintenance was only 56 percent. The rate has since decreased because of MATGENEE's lack&#13;
of maintenance of equipment.&#13;
2.29   The poor condition of the rural transport infrastructure is due to the ad-hoc consideration that has&#13;
been given to its development. Thousands of km of roads were constructed as part of rural development,&#13;
agricultural or other projects without a common strategy, consultation with appropriate road agencies and&#13;
due consideration to maintenance requirements after construction. The 28,000 km-long rural transport&#13;
infrastructure, which has not been maintained for several years because of lack of financing, is now in very&#13;
poor condition, and will need to be rehabilitated or rebuilt. About 12,500 km of rural roads are under&#13;
MINTP's responsibility. Although MINTP's budget includes some funds for rural transport infrastructure,&#13;
priority is given to the primary road network and almost no maintenance works are executed on rural roads.&#13;
The remaining rural roads (15,500 km) fall under the responsibility of local governments or communities&#13;
and agricultural development companies. Local governments or communities do not have fiscal autonomy&#13;
and do not have resources to maintain the rural roads. They were rarely involved in the decision to build&#13;
these roads. Agricultural development companies have built about 10,000 km of rural roads. Some were&#13;
transferred to MINTP and some are still maintained by the companies. The agricultural development&#13;
companies also maintain some rural roads under MINTP's responsibility, as well as some primary roads.&#13;
Village and farm access tracks are unaccounted. Their construction and maintenance is the sole&#13;
responsibility of villagers.&#13;
2.30   The weak fiscal situation and priority given by the Government to the payment of salaries and to&#13;
the service of the external debt are the reasons for the lack of financing for road maintenance. In&#13;
1993/1994, total government revenue amounted to US$650 million against US$1,245 million of planned&#13;
expenditure. Salaries and the service of the external debt accounted for US$1,000 million, 50 percent more&#13;
than Government revenue. Although the Government has acknowledged that road maintenance is the&#13;
second priority after salaries in the allocation of resources, it has been unable to make the necessary&#13;
resources available. In 1985/1986, about US$100 million, excluding salaries of MENTP staff, were&#13;
allocated from local and external resources to the road subsector for routine and periodic road maintenance,&#13;
including some openings of feeder roads. In 1991, this allocation was reduced to about US$27 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                                   Transport Sector Project&#13;
That year, the shortfall in the annual volume of maintenance works (i.e., the difference between road&#13;
maintenance expenditure necessary to maintain the entire network and the amount actually spent) was&#13;
estimated at USS144 million. In 1992-1993, the actual amount spent for routine and periodic road&#13;
maintenance was about US$10 million. Salaries amounted to about US$7 million in 1993-1994. In&#13;
comparison, the fiscal revenues collected from the transport sector were estimated at US$130 million in&#13;
1993-1994, about 20% of government revenue. US$60 million (46 percent) were collected from taxes&#13;
specific to the transport sector, of which US$53 million from taxation on petroleum products. Table 2&#13;
details the discrepancies between revenues collected form the road sector and financial requirements for&#13;
road maintenance.&#13;

2.31   Lack of Competiveness. The costs caused by weak port management, protection of the national&#13;
shipping line, together with the inadequate legal, fiscal, and regulatory framework, and poorly maintained&#13;
nfrastructure, aggravate Cameroon's lack of competitiveness in transit transport, both within the country,&#13;
as well as to and from the neighboring hinterland (Chad and Central African Republic-CAR). Before&#13;
devaluation, the cost of road transport was high (about four times the cost in Pakistan and twice the cost in&#13;
France) and hindered the competitiveness of export products of the Central African countries. The many&#13;
cumbersome customs regulations to control evasion of customs duties cause delays in transit. In spite of&#13;
these regulations, about half of the customs revenues are lost because of fiaud and an inefficient&#13;
bureaucracy. Financial transactions associated with clearing and transiting import freight into and out of&#13;
the region significantly increase the cost of transit transport. Transaction costs paid by transit and&#13;
transport operators to customs and police agents to ease transit operations range between 6 percent and 29&#13;
percent of land transport for a 15-ton container in transit to CAR and Chad. According to IMF data, the&#13;
cost of regional non-factor services on imports in 1992-1993 was 16 percent for Cameroon, 39 percent for&#13;
Chad and 31 percent for the Central African Republic.&#13;
2.32   The main obstacles in the transit chain are summarized below:&#13;
(a)    Freight-forwarders charge 1.25 percent of the shipment's value to shippers to cover posting&#13;
a bond, although the actual cost of the bond charged by a bank is 0.25 percent per quarter.&#13;
(b)    Premiums for transport insurance must be paid to local insurance companies which have&#13;
insufficient resources and competence to settle damages, and are also often paid to foreign&#13;
companies.&#13;
(c)    The signature of customs documents by the Minister of Finance is compulsory for transit&#13;
of "sensitive" goods (textiles, alcoholic beverages, goods produced in Cameroon at higher&#13;
than world market prices).&#13;
(d)    Customs escorts are compulsory for transit transport until the border, at the cost of the&#13;
importer, to ensure that goods exit Cameroon.&#13;
2.33   Lack of security in the port of Douala also impedes Cameroon's competitiveness for transit traffic&#13;
and increases port transit costs. Port facilities and areas are openly accessible to non-authorized persons,&#13;
as check points are not efficiently manned. The presence of the administrative offices of Customs in the&#13;
center of the port generates uncontrolled traffic. Police do not effectively control the port area. Pilferage is&#13;
common during unloading of general merchandise, and containers selected by Customs for inspection are&#13;
often found vandalized thereafter. Although ONPC is legally empowered to protect the port against theft&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

and disorder, it shifts the responsibility to the Government. The port handling companies have made their&#13;
own private arrangements at additional costs for the goods.&#13;
3. TRANSPORT SECTOR PROGRAM&#13;
3.1    The Government has developed an overall transport sector program to complete the adjustment of&#13;
the sector institutions and address the financial issues in the sector. It has been designed to replace the past&#13;
project-by-project approach with a sustained process of sound sector policy making and rational investment&#13;
decision tied to Cameroon's macroeconomic performance and absorptive capacity. The program was&#13;
established after a 4-year consultation process with sector stakeholders:&#13;
(a)    A thorough analysis of all transport subsectors was carried out in close association with&#13;
the Government to arrive at a broadly internalized consensus on sector issues and the need&#13;
for reform. The analysis was translated in a Transport Sector Strategy Memorandum&#13;
(Report No. 11430-CM, June 30, 1993).&#13;
(b)    Several seminars were organized to involve pluri-disciplinary groups of public and private&#13;
sector representatives to discuss sector issues, formulate policy measures and outline a&#13;
new sector reform program.&#13;
(c)    An interministerial group was created to foster inter-ministerial concurrence, prepare a&#13;
draft reform program including a matrix of action for discussion within their own&#13;
ministries, and produce a truly internalized program.&#13;
(d)    Several donors meetings were organized by the Government to keep the donors informed&#13;
on as well as discuss with them the transport sector reform program. Meetings internal to&#13;
the donors' community were also held to forge closer alliance among donors and adopt a&#13;
common approach.&#13;
3.2    Section A describes the overarching program objectives. Section B details the reform program and&#13;
its implementation timetable. Section C presents the investment program which will be executed during the&#13;
1995/1996-1999/2000 period in parallel with the implementation of the reform program. Section D&#13;
summarizes the benefits and the risks associated to the program, including those related to the&#13;
environmental impact of the program. Section E describes the implementation arrangements.&#13;
A. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.3    The program, as stated in the Government letter of sector policy (Schedule 1), aims at improved&#13;
efficiency and sustainable and coherent development in the transport sector to enable it to resume its&#13;
contribution to development, poverty alleviation and protection of the environment. These objectives would&#13;
be achieved by: (a) State divestiture from transport operations in favor of a greater involvement of private&#13;
operators, and institutions more focused on planning, regulation and definition of sector policies; (b) better&#13;
balance in resource allocation between prudent investments and maintenance expenditures, and sustainable&#13;
resource mobilization; (c) improved regulatory framework resulting in more liberalization, increased&#13;
competitiveness and more competition; and (d) development and implementation of a sector policy to&#13;
protect the environment. The letter of sector policy and its matrix of action agreed during negotiations&#13;
should be adopted by the Government before Boardpresentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                      Transport Sector Project&#13;
B. PROGRAm DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.4    Civil Aviation.  In September 1994, the Government agreed to privatize both domestic and&#13;
international air transport operations in Cameroon. The agreed strategy consists in the winding-down of&#13;
CAMAIR and the creation of a new company for the provision of air services. Control and ownership of&#13;
the new company to the private sector would be transferred through a management contract with deferred&#13;
privatization option or by capitalizing the new company by a group of private investors. There is a&#13;
potential for private provision of air services, both by national investors or in partnership with foreign&#13;
carriers. Since 1994, four national air carrier were authorized to operate in Cameroon. South African&#13;
Airways has also hinted at possible cooperation. However, if the private sector was not interested in&#13;
participating in the ownership of the new company, the Government would divest the aviation related assets&#13;
and auction the traffic rights to domestic/regional air carriers. The strategy for the privatization of air&#13;
services and key financial data are presented in the Technical Annex of the SAR for the Transport Sector&#13;
Technical Assistance Credit. Timing targets for the critical steps of the process are in the matrix of action&#13;
attached to the letter of sector policy. Benefits resulting from this privatization are presented in Schedule 2.&#13;
Bidding for the selection of the private strategic partner is expected to be launched before August 1996.&#13;
Status of progress: The financial adviser which will assist the Government in the privatization process was&#13;
appointed in February 1996.&#13;
3.5   In conjunction with the privatization of air services, CAMAIR is preparing to reduce its number of&#13;
employees. On the basis of typical ratios for airline companies, it is estimated that CAMAIR is overstaffed&#13;
by 600 to 800 employees or about half of its personnel. When funds for severance payment are available, a&#13;
first group of employees would be laid off. A second group would be laid off after a decision is taken by&#13;
the management team of the new company on the number of staff which would be rehired by the new&#13;
company. Status of Progress. A consultant, hired under the Transport Sector Technical Assistance&#13;
Project, is evaluating CAMAIR's employees to provide the basis for staff reduction.&#13;
3.6    An outright liquidation of CAMAIR would have been politically unacceptable. The Government&#13;
attaches great importance to CAMAIR as the national flag carrier, not only because it services domestic&#13;
routes, but also because it puts Cameroon on the map regionally and internationally. The Government also&#13;
considers that Cameroon, a country with a population of 12 million, needs a domestic air service. The&#13;
Government recognizes that a solution needs to be found, which would be compatible with political&#13;
constraints, to stop subsidizing air services. IDA's position is that Carneroon is entitled to an air service&#13;
provided that it is efficient, not subsidized, and operates on market principles, preferably with a majority of&#13;
private shareholders. Following the detailed studies carried out on CAMAIR, the Government requested&#13;
that concrete proposals be presented, which resulted in the strategy mentioned above. Two options were&#13;
also considered but rejected: (a) elimination of budget support, which would cut spending in vital sectors;&#13;
and (b) execution of another performance contract, which was unsuccessfully attempted under the SAL&#13;
(1989).&#13;
3.7   In order to increase the efficiency for the provision of air transport services in Cameroon, and to&#13;
promote private sector participation, the regulatory framework should be revised before completion of&#13;
privatization. The status of the revision is the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3 -Transport Sector Program                                                         13&#13;

Short term: less than one year; medium term: between 1 and 3 years; long term: more than three years.&#13;
3.8    Railway. The Governnent has agreed to separate the ownership of the infrastructure from railway&#13;
operations by creating a new private company to commercially operate railway services for freight through&#13;
a concession agreement. The core shareholders of the new operating company would be selected following&#13;
intemational bidding procedures. The Government has still to choose the conditions of operations for&#13;
passenger services from four options: (a) include the services in the concession agreement as public service&#13;
obligations; (b) contract an agreement with a private company distinct from the concessionary company for&#13;
freight; (c) replace rail passenger services by bus services and contract a private company for the operation&#13;
of these services; and (d) stop providing passenger services while maintaining the roads accessing the&#13;
villages along the railway track. The strategy for the privatization of railway operations, key financial data&#13;
after privatization and a preliminary risk analysis for both Govemment and private investors are presented&#13;
in the Technical Annex of the SAR for the Transport Sector Technical Assistance Credit. Timing targets&#13;
for the critical steps of the process are in the matrix of action attached to the letter of sector policy.&#13;
Benefits resulting from the privatization are presented in Schedule 2. Preselection of the potential private&#13;
majority shareholders of the concessionary company is expected to be launched in April 1996. Status of&#13;
progress: A decision on passenger services has to be taken before launching the tender for the selection of&#13;
the private majority shareholder. The financial adviser which will assist the Govermment in the&#13;
privatization process was appointed in December 1995.&#13;
3.9    Revision of the regulatory framework is needed to accompany the privatization of railway&#13;
operations. The status of the revision is as follows:&#13;
Action                                   Status                  Timetable&#13;

of transport.&#13;
The railway transit procedures should be improved.   The reform will be implemented as part Long term&#13;
of the UDEAC Transport Reform&#13;
Program (see paras. 3.16-3.17).&#13;
3.10   Urban Transport.  The Government has decided to liquidate SOTUC, the public urban bus&#13;
company and divest of urban transport. On February 22, 1995, the General Assembly of shareholders&#13;
officially announced SOTUC's liquidation, and services were stopped. A liquidator was appointed in April&#13;
1995, whose terms of reference sought the completion of liquidation within sixth months, once the&#13;
procedure has begun. Benefits to the Cameroonian economy resulting from the liquidation, are presented in&#13;
Schedule 2. The conditions of access to the industry, related to vehicle insurance, vehicle certification,&#13;
taxation of activity and vehicle safety should be revised accordingly. Status of Progress. The liquidation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                      Transport Sector Project&#13;
has been delayed because of lack of decision by MINEFI regarding the settlement of SOTUC's debts and&#13;
arrears and because of procurement issues in the sale of the buses. Draft recommendations on the new&#13;
regulatory and institutional framework for urban transport were discussed during a seminar held in&#13;
November 1995. The seminar was attended by private urban transport operators, representatives of local&#13;
governments, the Administration, commercial bankers and donors. Based on the outcome of the seminar, a&#13;
new regulation was drafted. The Government should enact the new institutional and regulatory framework&#13;
for urban transport before effectiveness.&#13;
3.11   Interurban Transport. The Government is studying simplification of the taxation system for road&#13;
transport, through the creation of a road tax collected by one institution only (thus replacing several taxes&#13;
collected at different stages, by several institutions), as well as a road user charge, clearly identified in the&#13;
price of petroleum products, to be used to finance road maintenance (see para. 3.24). The Ministry of&#13;
Economy and Finance (MINEFI) has not yet agreed to such a simplification, or to the implementation&#13;
arrangements. Status of Progress. Recommendations on the simplification of the road taxation system&#13;
prepared by a task force created by MINEFI are being reviewed by the Government. Once decision is&#13;
taken by the Government, implementation arrangements have to be defined, especially the responsibilities&#13;
of both MINEFI and MINT.&#13;
3.12   A presidential decree was taken in 1995 to remove illegal road controls by the administration&#13;
(police, customs, etc.). The experience shows that such decree has a temporary impact and illegal controls&#13;
reappear soon.  MINT intends to follow up on the compliance with the decree to prevent such&#13;
reappearance. Toll roads were created in 1993, but revenues have been far lower than expected because of&#13;
fraud, estimated at 50 percent. A decision on their privatization or removal will be taken as part of the&#13;
simplification of the road taxation system. In parallel to the simplification of the road taxation system,&#13;
truck loads should be limited to reduce considerable overloads especially on timber trucks. Four weighing&#13;
stations on the Douala-Yaoundd road were rehabilitated under the Sixth Highway Project (Loan BO 18-CM)&#13;
in 1994. Status of Progress. The operation of two weighing stations which was going to be started by&#13;
MINT was postponed by the Government. MINT wants to fine overloaded trucks, but the trucking industry&#13;
is complaining that the axle load regulation is inadequate and that its application would hamper the&#13;
competitiveness of the industry. Collection of statistics on truck loads should start at least at two weighing&#13;
stations on the Douala-Yaounde road as a condition for disbursement of the paved road component of the&#13;
IDA credit. The Government should enact a new regulation based on data collected and after discussions&#13;
with the trucking industry.&#13;
3.13   Maritime Transport. The Government has agreed to privatize CAMSHIP, the national shipping&#13;
line, and to privatize or liquidate CAMTAINER, the national road carrier and freight forwarder. Key&#13;
financial data after privatization are presented in the Technical Annex of the SAR for the Transport Sector&#13;
Technical Assistance Credit. Timing targets for the critical steps of the process are in the matrix of action&#13;
attached to the letter of sector policy. Benefits to the Cameroonian economy resulting from the privatization&#13;
are presented in Schedule 2. Status of Progress. The financial adviser which will assist the Government&#13;
in the privatization process was appointed in October 1995.&#13;
3.14   Early 1995, the National Assembly adopted a law which liberalizes access to the maritime industry&#13;
by Cameroonian shipping lines. Although the Government agrees to the final objective of fully liberalizing&#13;
maritime transport, it wants to maintain the current regulation on cargo distribution during a transitory&#13;
period. The 1995 law suppresses CAMSHIP's monopoly, but maintains the application of the Code of&#13;
Conduct (see paras. 2.8 and 2.18 above) and the protection of Cameroonian shipping lines. As an&#13;
immediate step of the liberalization process and to set up an acceptable regulatory framework in parallel to&#13;
the privatization of CAMSHIP, the manner in which the Code of Conduct is applied should be revised in&#13;
order to comply with the clauses of the Code. Accordingly, the quota system would be applied to the Liner&#13;
Conference traffic and no more to the entire Cameroonian maritime traffic, especially not to bulk traffic.&#13;
Terms and conditions for freight transport outside of the Liner Conference traffic, and currently contracted-&#13;
&#13;

Chapter 3 -Transport Sector Program                                                    15&#13;
out to CAMSHIP (clinker and petroleum products), should also be reviewed to decide whether or not these&#13;
contracts should be abolished and retendered. Further steps in the liberalization process should be&#13;
coordinated at the regional level, as part of the Trade and Transport component of the Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
Transport Policy Program (SSATP), which involves Sub-Saharan African countries and most of the donors&#13;
involved in transport in this area. The Trade and Transport component aims at establishing a new maritime&#13;
transport policy for Sub-Saharan African countries. Status of Progress. The decrees defining the&#13;
modalities of application of the 1995 law were approved by the Government in April 1996. The&#13;
preparation of a new regional maritime policy is still at the studies stage under the SSATP. Studies are&#13;
expected to be completed, and recommendations discussed during a regional seminar of SSATP countries&#13;
and donors in 1996. The discussion between the Govermment and IDA will continue as part of the&#13;
discussions on the overall adjustment program. A study is included in the Transport Sector Technical&#13;
Assistance Project to identify the bottlenecks in the intemational chain of transport and to estimate their&#13;
costs to prioritize reform actions. This study will support the discussions on the timetable for the full&#13;
liberalization of maritime transport. The contract with the consultant which will carry out the study is at the&#13;
negotiation stage.&#13;
3.15   To be consistent with the sector policy, the role of CNCC, the Shippers' Council, should be&#13;
revised. As a first step, CNCC should control a posteriori the application of the Code of Conduct.&#13;
Financing of CNCC by a 0.3 percent surcharge on importlexport by sea and waivers paid by shipping lines&#13;
to transport freight toward Africa should be stopped, and CNCC should be financed from the State's&#13;
budget. Further steps will be defined as part of the Trade and Transport SSATP component. The role of&#13;
CNCC was discussed by CNCC, public and private shippers, CAMSHIP, and the Cameroonian&#13;
Administration during a seminar, and during several meetings of a committee created to follow up on&#13;
recommendations made during this seminar. However, the committee's recommendations maintain the&#13;
current role of CNCC and financing means while adding the roles of economic observer of the transport&#13;
sector and strengthening the services to shippers. Status ofProgress. The draft decree defining the control&#13;
a posteriori is being reviewed by the Government.&#13;
3.16   Transit Transport. Within the Union of Central African States (UDEAC) framework, the 1989&#13;
Joint EU-World Bank initiative launched a transit transport facilitation program in the Central Africa&#13;
subregion. The obstacles to trade and facilitation prevalent throughout the UDEAC customs were analyzed&#13;
by the UDEAC countries during preparation of the transport component of the UDEAC Regional Policy&#13;
Reform Program (Report No. 1 1296-AFR dated April 30, 1993) in collaboration with the EU and IDA. In&#13;
joint workshops held in November 1991, and in March and December 1993, the UDEAC countries agreed&#13;
to a Program of Regional Reforms to improve transit conditions. National Transit Commnittees were&#13;
created in the six UDEAC countries to draw up plans to: (a) simplify customs documents and devise a&#13;
system of regional transit under customs bonds (TIPAC); (b) review the criteria for establishing bonded&#13;
customs centers; (c) redefine transit requirements for intermodal transport (rail/road, rail/river) and&#13;
containers; and (d) improve road transport conditions and regulations (maintenance of international&#13;
itineraries, trucking liabilities, vehicle inspection, and cost recovery).&#13;
3.17   The TIPAC mechanism is a procedure whereby goods travel duty free across the border under&#13;
customs bonds, accompanied by a bill of lading, with the liability for possible loss of customs duties held&#13;
by the transport operator. The Manual of Procedures for the TIPAC was adopted by the UDEAC&#13;
countries in March 1993. The mechanism is similar to the transit system in Europe (TIR), where this&#13;
liability is guaranteed and surveyed by the International Road Union (IRU). For the liability to be credible&#13;
to customs in UDEAC countries, the bill of lading and the transporter must be covered by a regional&#13;
insurance policy which would reimburse customs for lost duties should the transport operator or the&#13;
importer abuse the mechanism by evading import duties. The insurance policy would be funded from the&#13;
sale of vouchers attached to the bill of lading. The regional insurance policy is being designed and&#13;
candidate institutions were identified to manage the insurance policy. EU financing is available to provide&#13;
assistance for the implementation of the TIPAC, which is expected to be completed two years after&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                   Transport Sector Project&#13;
commencement of the assistance. An action plan and a timetable are provided in Schedule 3. Delays in&#13;
implementation of the TIPAC are due to the difficulty to hire the international coordinator who will assist&#13;
the regional and national committees.&#13;
3.18   The policy measures to complement the TIPAC system are the following:&#13;
(a)   streamline road transport regulations to harmonize national and UDEAC transport&#13;
regulations and vehicle standards; harmonize the structure of road user charges; enforce&#13;
control of truck overloading to prevent road deterioration;&#13;
(b)   seek legal registration of customs agents, forwarding agents, and international road&#13;
transporters, and agree to and enforce criteria underlying the approval of such registration;&#13;
(c)    harmonize and liberalize freight insurance in UDEAC.&#13;
3.19   As most of the obstacles to transit transport occur in Cameroon, the success of this program&#13;
depends to a large extent on the willingness of the Cameroonian authorities to take the necessary measures&#13;
to overcome these obstacles. In addition to the measures to be taken at the regional level, Cameroon should&#13;
shorten the list of sensitive goods which require a customs clearance for transit; limit road controls by the&#13;
administration to those specified in the UDEAC legislation; and suppress requirements for customs escorts&#13;
for transit goods through Cameroon. The requirement to domicile invoices and import licenses in Chad and&#13;
the Central African Republic was removed in 1994. The continued dialogue between UDEAC countries&#13;
within the framework of the UDEAC Regional Policy Reform Program and its transport component will be&#13;
key to the success of the TIPAC as well as to the removal of obstacles to transit in Cameroon.&#13;
3.20   The Cameroonian customs need a comprehensive overhaul. In March 1995, the French Ministry&#13;
of Cooperation (FAC) prepared a plan for improving customs' performance and efficiency. The plan&#13;
includes the following measures: (a) carry out a human resource development plan; (b) improve human&#13;
resource management; (c) revise the organizational chart based on actual workloads; (d) rehabilitate the&#13;
customs computerized system; (e) transfer customs headquarters to new offices outside from the port,&#13;
rehabilitate existing buildings and provide telecommunication equipment; and (f) maximize the input of the&#13;
preshipment inspection company (para. 1.3). Details are provided in Schedule 4. Status of Progress. The&#13;
preshipment inspection company was made responsible for customs duties assessments and monitoring of&#13;
actual collection in 1995. The Government is in the process to choose the new customs computerized&#13;
system. Arrangements to implement the remaining measures in the plan described above have still to be&#13;
worked out. The financing to support the restructuring of customs is still sought. FAC and CFD have&#13;
expressed an interest. The discussion between the Government and donors will continue as part of the&#13;
general discussion on structural adjustment.&#13;
3.21   The physical component of the transport component of the UDEAC reform program consists of:&#13;
(a) rehabilitation and maintenance of international road itineraries to CAR and Chad, as agreed by the&#13;
UDEAC Steering Committee in June 1993; (b) improvement of the customs facilities in Douala and at&#13;
border crossings with CAR and Chad; (c) rehabilitation of the computerized customs declaration system in&#13;
Douala, and provision of a modem telecommunication system; and (d) provision of international trucking&#13;
facilities at Douala port. The rehabilitation of the Cameroon-CAR road itinerary and provision of a&#13;
modem telecommunication system are being executed with EU financing. Status of Progress. Detailed&#13;
engineering studies for the rehabilitation of the intemational itineraries are underway.&#13;

Chapter 3 -Transport Sector Program                                                   17&#13;
3.22   Primary Roads Maintenance.  The Government has agreed to a new strategy for road&#13;
maintenance to improve its efficiency and its sustainability:&#13;
(a)    To adjust the road maintenance program to management and financing capacity: A 13,738&#13;
km priority network out of 21,343 km of primary paved and earth roads (see Maps IBRD&#13;
Nos. 24837 and 24838) has been identified based on: economic importance (traffic flows);&#13;
consistency of the network and needs for links between urban centers and regions of&#13;
agricultural production; communication between administrative centers; and regional&#13;
equity. The priority network includes all paved roads (4,054 kIn), 8,568 km of earth roads&#13;
of economic importance and 1,136 km of earth roads responding to the above criteria other&#13;
than economic importance. Detailed characteristics of the priority network are available in&#13;
the project file.&#13;
Type of network                           Total network   Priority network&#13;
(km)           (km)&#13;

Rural Transport Infrastructure              27,935          10,952&#13;
Total                                       49,278          24,710&#13;
(b)    To disengage itself progressively from maintenance execution: Periodic maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation of all paved roads, as well as periodic maintenance of earth roads, and&#13;
progressively routine maintenance of earth and paved roads would be contracted-out to&#13;
private contractors, including the local construction industry, small contractors, village&#13;
workers, and communities, using labor-intensive methods and local materials, where&#13;
possible.&#13;
(c)    To  improve planning  and  programming  capacity: A  pluri-annual maintenance&#13;
programming system will be established using as criteria the existing level of service of the&#13;
priority road network, and also climatological, geographical and geotechnical parameters.&#13;
The system is being defined under an IDA-financed study for earth roads, and Germany-&#13;
financed study for paved roads.&#13;
(d)    To focus MINTP's role on planning, programming and budgeting, supervising works and&#13;
controlling objectives: External audits of technical and financial performance and of&#13;
procurement procedures would be carried out to ensure accountability.&#13;
(e)    To encourage development of small and medium contractors by providing training in&#13;
technical and financial management; by creating a stable market; by defining policies to&#13;
eliminate present constraints to private sector participation; by revising procurement&#13;
regulations; and by establishing a rapid payment system because small contractors do not&#13;
have sufficient working capital to prefinance expenditures for works: Use of small and&#13;
medium enterprises for road maintenance was tested under EU financing. A road&#13;
maintenance program amounting to about US$26 million was contracted out to 38 small&#13;
and medium enterprises (SMEs). SMEs which had been preselected, were trained on&#13;
procurement and management of road works. Lessons learned from this project were used&#13;
to prepare the application of the new strategy to the entire priority network.&#13;
(f)    To ensure sustainability of road maintenance financing and transparency and&#13;
accountability in the use of funds. A Road Maintenance Account would be used as a&#13;
mechanism to achieve these objectives (see para. 3.24).&#13;
&#13;

3.23   The status of preparation of the strategy and the timetable for its implementation are the following:&#13;

3.24   The Ministry of Economy and Finance has created a Road Maintenance Account in a commercial&#13;
bank to which funds would be allocated from the budget to finance road maintenance expenditures. A task&#13;
force created by the Ministry of Finance on the financing of road maintenance endorsed the&#13;
recommendation made during a national seminar and several regional seminars on the road maintenance&#13;
strategy to create a Road Fund funded by a road user charge under the supervision of a committee&#13;
constituted of representatives of road users, local Governments and central Government. Status of&#13;
progress. The Government has defined management procedures, including annual audits, of the Road&#13;
Maintenance Account. The account should be opened and an initial deposit paid before effectiveness. In&#13;
April 1996, the Government approved the principle of a Road Fund and is reviewing the recommendations&#13;
mentioned above.&#13;
3.25   The Government has adopted a program to progressively contract out road maintenance (see&#13;
matrix of action attached to the letter of sector policy). However, the experience from previous highway&#13;
projects in Cameroon points to the difficulty to ensure compliance with as well as monitor such program,&#13;
especially with respect to routine maintenance. This is due to the geographical spreading out of the works,&#13;
their variety, the need to implement the monitoring system involving large amounts of training and&#13;
equipment as well as technical assistance. Experience under the Sixth Highway Project also shows the&#13;
difficulty to sustain the organization necessary to execute and monitor such program. Therefore, it is&#13;
proposed to adopt a progressive approach with realistic objectives easy to monitor aimed at sustaining the&#13;
maintenance of invested capital. Starting when the Road Maintenance Account is created, the minimum of&#13;
funds allocated to the Account for maintenance by contract during each fiscal year would be equal to&#13;
resources needed to maintain by contract roads which were built, rehabilitated or maintained by contract&#13;
since January 1st, 1990. Such approach would lead to a progressive increase in the minimum amount of&#13;
resources allocated to road maintenance by contract. A programn of allocation of funds was established in&#13;
accordance with the proposed approach. Funds should be allocated in accordance with the program before&#13;
effectiveness. Fund allocation and use of these funds to maintain the roads defined as above, will be closely&#13;
monitored during project execution in order to decide on financing a second- and third-year slice of the road&#13;
maintenance program under the IDA credit.&#13;
3.26   Rural Transport Infrastructure. Improvement of rural transport infrastructure is one of the&#13;
actions to reduce poverty that was identified during a national workshop on poverty held in November&#13;
1994. To achieve this objective, delegation of authority for the management of rural transport&#13;
infrastructure should be entailed to local govermnents, local communities down to village level and&#13;
community groups depending on the type of rural roads.  To make rural transport infrastructure&#13;
manageable, the not-homogenous and vast rural transport infrastructure has to be divided into clearly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3 -Transport Sector Program                                                   19&#13;
defined sub-categories which fall under the responsibility of these various institutions. This would be a&#13;
significant shift from the current centralized system regarding decision-making and execution, and has to be&#13;
implemented in conjunction with the overall decentralization process where the central government would&#13;
divest of implementation and execution of investment projects of local importance.&#13;
3.27   Because full decentralization cannot be achieved in a short period of time, the objective for the&#13;
period covered by the program is to launch the decentralization process in the management of rural&#13;
infrastructure and to set up an institutional framework which involves beneficiaries at the various steps m&#13;
the management of rural transport infrastructure maintenance: (a) planning: in the choice of itineraries to be&#13;
maintained; (b) periodic maintenance and rehabilitation: in the procurement process for contracting out&#13;
rehabilitation works; and (c) maintenance: in the financing of maintenance works as well as in their&#13;
execution. Itineraries would be chosen in accordance with pre-established criteria within a 10,952 km&#13;
priority network agreed by the Government. The priority network consists of rural roads whose&#13;
rehabilitation would generate a rate of return above 10 percent. Details on the priority network are&#13;
available in the project file. Rehabilitation would be limited to critical spots in order to make the roads&#13;
passable in all season and adapt their characteristics to the maintenance capacity of local communities.&#13;
Periodic maintenance and rehabilitation would be financed by the State; routine maintenance would be&#13;
financed by the local communities. Such strategy should be discussed in several regional seminars and a&#13;
national seminar and disseminated during a sensitization and training program aimed at the rural road&#13;
administration, the local governments and direct beneficiaries.&#13;
3.28   Priority for the execution of maintenance works should be given to small and medium enterprises&#13;
and to the use of labor-based methods and local materials. The emphasis on execution of routine&#13;
maintenance supports these objectives as these works, such as brush-clearing are labor intensive. The&#13;
critical-spot approach for rehabilitation is also suited to these objectives. Works are scattered resulting in&#13;
small contracts that can be executed by the local SMEs, which have a limited capacity. Road standards&#13;
and norms for the execution of maintenance works should also be defined with the objective of promoting&#13;
labor-based methods and the use of local materials.&#13;
3.29   AMTGENIE. The Government has agreed to retrench on its equipment rental activity. The&#13;
strategy consists in splitting MATGENIE into five separate entities and progressively privatizing these&#13;
entities. Critical steps and timing targets are in the matrix of action attached to the letter of sector policy.&#13;
This would make it easier to privatize MATGENIE in accordance with the financial capacity of local&#13;
investors. Both direct privatization through sale of public participation in the entities, or privatization of&#13;
management could be considered. This option would also introduce an element of competition among the&#13;
five entities. Although liquidation of MATGENIE and sale of the equipment was initially considered, this&#13;
option was not retained as the road maintenance organization and financing still need to be sustained before&#13;
local investors can be expected to invest in equipment rental, and supply the full equipment required for&#13;
road maintenance. The regional managers should be appointed before effectiveness.&#13;
3.30   The number of items of equipment needed for the maintenance of the priority network is estimated&#13;
at 941. Depending on the capacity of private entrepreneurs to provide their own equipment, the number of&#13;
items of equipment to be provided by MATGENIE in the future ranges from 130 to 190. The number of&#13;
employees is estimated at 300, against 385 after the 1994 restructuring. In April 1995, MATGENIE&#13;
owned 734 items of equipment of which 55 percent were operational (up from 31 percent in April 1994),&#13;
26 percent needed heavy repairs (down from 49 percent in April 1994), and 19 percent should be scrapped.&#13;
MATGENIE and MINTP are preparing the auction of the equipment to be scrapped which should take&#13;
place before the end of 1995.&#13;
3.31 LABOGENIE. The Government has agreed to restructure LABOGENIE. The process will&#13;
consist in financial restructuring and dismissal of about 300 employees. This is expected to result in the&#13;
creation of local consulting firms specialized in the field of geotechnics and foster competition for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                                                   Transport Sector Project&#13;
geotechnical supervision of road works. The legal statute of LABOGENIE for the long term has still to be&#13;
defined and the potential participation of private investors in the company to be established.&#13;
LABOGENIE's operating expenditures should be reduced by 30 percent in relation to LABOGENIE's&#13;
FY94 accounts before effectiveness.&#13;
3.32   Port Activities. The Government has defined a new strategy for port operations:&#13;
(a)    Dredging of the access channel will be contracted out to ensure efficient and sustainable&#13;
performance of the activity. The Govermnent is considering two options to contract out&#13;
dredging: (a) select a firm through international competitive bidding; or (b) promote the&#13;
creation of a local firm with participation of local and foreign private and public partners.&#13;
Status of Progress: A consultant is being selected to compare the two options and provide&#13;
the elements of decision to the Government. Implementation of the option would be a&#13;
condition for any further IDA involvement in the port sector.&#13;
(b)    Port operators should be more involved in the management of the port authority and im the&#13;
definition of strategies in the sector by redefining the relationships between stakeholders&#13;
within the port community and by increasing the participation of port users in the Board of&#13;
Directors of the port authority. The contractual relationships between the port authority&#13;
and port operators need to be revised to provide investment incentives, and to encourage&#13;
the commitment of port operators to the long-term development of Cameroonian ports.&#13;
Status of Progress. The arrangements related to the new role of port operators are being&#13;
defined. Their implementation would be a condition for further IDA involvement in the&#13;
port sector.&#13;
(c)    The port authority will be restructured to reduce operating costs and tariffs on the basis of&#13;
the analytical accounting being implemented. A human resource development plan should&#13;
be established and implemented in conjunction with the restructuring. Status of Progress.&#13;
The action plan prepared by ONPC for FY96 and FY97 is attached to the letter of sector&#13;
policy. Technical assistance is being selected as part of the Transport Sector TA Project to&#13;
support the port authority during the restructuring process. Operational and financial&#13;
targets to be met by the port authority within one year after the start of the technical&#13;
assistance should be established before Board presentation.&#13;
(d)    The investment plan is being revised to reflect economic priorities and ONPC's capacity to&#13;
finance the plan. This capacity was assessed in a study available in project files. The&#13;
order of priority is: dredging of the channel, rehabilitation of port infrastructure,&#13;
construction of a berth for timber vessels, implementation of the management information&#13;
system, modernization of the container terninal, and construction of dikes to calibrate the&#13;
access channel. Including on-going investments, the five-year investment plan amounts to&#13;
US$116 million (CFAF57.7 billion), of which 51% is available external financing, 19% is&#13;
own financing and 30% is sought from external donors. The investment plan agreed&#13;
between the Ministry of Transport and ONPC is attached in Schedule 5.&#13;
3.33  Institutions. As mentioned above, MINTP's role would be to program, manage and supervise road&#13;
muintenance works, most of which will be contracted to private contractors. Following the 1995 revision&#13;
of the national procurement code, MINTP became autonomous in procurement decisions on maintenance&#13;
works below a certain amount to ensure efficient execution of road maintenance by small and medium-size&#13;
contractors (para. 2.7). MINT would focus on sector strategy, policy formulation and transport regulation.&#13;
Status of Progress. An IDA-financed study was carried out to prepare MINTP's shift toward its new role.&#13;
MlNTP's procurement committee should be created before Board presentation. The Government should&#13;
decide before effectiveness on an action plan for restructuring of MINTP. Progress in restructuring of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3 -Transport Sector Program                                                  21&#13;
MINTP according to the action plan would be reviewed by IDA before agreeing to finance subsequent&#13;
slices of road maintenance works. A FAC-financed study will be carried out to prepare MINT&#13;
restructuring. MINT restructuring would be implemented as part of the project to accompany the&#13;
privatization of transport PEs. MINTP's restructuring is expected to be completed before August 31, 1996,&#13;
and MINT's restructuring before December 31, 1996.&#13;
C. SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM&#13;
3.34   Public Expenditures. The Government policy is to substantially change the structure and quality&#13;
of public expenditures by allocating and increasing proportion of spending to non-wage current and capital&#13;
expenditures, particularly primary and secondary education, basic health, agriculture services, maintenance&#13;
of transport infrastructure and special poverty reduction measures. This policy was reflected in the FY96&#13;
Finance Law which increased non-wage current expenditures for key development sectors from 30.5&#13;
percent of total non-wage expenditures in FY95 to 37 percent.&#13;
3.35   The distribution of the FY96 budget among ministries was prepared by the Government in&#13;
consultation with IDA as part of the SAL preparation. The operating and investment budgets of MINT&#13;
and MINTP are provided in table 3. The investment budget is split into two priorities to allow adjustment&#13;
in accordance with the actual fiscal revenues. Determination of priorities by Goverrnment remain ad-hoc.&#13;
The Government provided assurance durtng negotiations that subsequent budgets and PIP for both&#13;
ministries would be adopted in the annual Finance Laws in consultation with IDA.&#13;

3.36   Two issues in relation with MINTP's budget are being addressed under the program:&#13;
(a)    Budget preparation: The budget should be established on the basis of actual maintenance&#13;
needs for the priority network. Currently, MINTP's budget in its presentation is scattered&#13;
among all roads with the political objective to satisfy all demands. The on-going road&#13;
programming study should provide the tool to establish more realistic budgets and help in&#13;
determining priorities.&#13;
(b)    Budget execution: Budget execution is less than satisfactory. Most of the budget is&#13;
executed by decentralized services of MINTP. MINTP is unable to consolidate the budget&#13;
execution at the end of year because of uneven information transmitted by its decentralized&#13;
services. Payments are made from the Treasury without the information being transmitted&#13;
to MINTP. Suppliers cover the risk of delays in payment by artificially increasing the&#13;
amount of invoices. MINEFI's information on the budget execution is not reliable because&#13;
of the absence of relation between the financial commitment and the actual execution of the&#13;
works of supply of the goods. The creation of the Road Maintenance Account (para. 3.24)&#13;
should significantly improve the quality of MINTP's budget execution by identifying the&#13;
expenditures prior to the allocation of resources to the Account and requesting a&#13;
justification for previous expenditures before replenishing the Account.&#13;
3.37   Recurrent Costs. Recurrent costs have been calculated for the priority network only. They include&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance costs. The average amounts of annual recurrent costs are estimated at&#13;
CFAF18.0 billion (US$35.4 million) (Table 4). This is CFAF2.7 billion above MINTP's budget for&#13;
FY96. This does not include resources required for urban roads (about 3,000 kIn) which are estimated at&#13;

are based on a network in good condition and maintained in accordance with reasonable standards. The&#13;
actual needs are much higher in the short term because most of the network is in fair to very poor condition,&#13;
and maintenance requirements are thus much higher to bring back the network to a good condition in a&#13;
short period of time. Actual costs are being estimated in the on-going road programming study. However,&#13;
it is clear that resources available from the Government and donors are insufficient to bring back the&#13;
network to a good condition and maintain the priority network with reasonable standards.&#13;

3.38   During the next four years at least, the Government will have to manage the political sensitive issue&#13;
resulting from the inadequacy between scarce resources and the financial requirements for road&#13;
maintenance. In addition, unaccountable force account will still continue to exist during this period,&#13;
although road maintenance will be progressively executed by contract. For these two reasons, targets have&#13;
not been established for the entire budget for road maintenance including force account. Assurance should&#13;
be sought during the annual review of the road maintenance budget by IDA that financial targets have been&#13;
established based on the evolution of the macro-economic situation, costs of road maintenance by contract&#13;
and the targets established in the matrix of action of the letter of sector policy for the progressive transfer&#13;
of road maintenance execution from force account to contract (para. 3.25) and that funds to be deposited&#13;
on the Road Maintenance Account should not be less that these financial targets.&#13;
3.39   Public Investment Program.  After having been subject to lengthy unsuccessful discussions&#13;
between the Bank and the Government for several years, the 1995/1996-1999/2000 Public Investment&#13;
Program (PIP) for the transport sector prepared in conjunction with the FY96 Finance Law represents an&#13;
improvement in comparison of the previous years. It is a first step toward an effective programming tool.&#13;
It includes only on-going projects and projects for which a preliminary agreement already exists between&#13;
the Government and the external donor. Most projects were or are being submitted to an economic&#13;
analysis. The PIP also includes taxes in accordance with the new tax regulation adopted in 1995. Further&#13;
improvement is needed to update more regularly data and reflect the actual execution of projects.&#13;
3.40   The total cost of the sector investment program, including taxes, is estimated at US$722.7 million.&#13;
The cost, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at US$614.1 million with a foreign exchange component of&#13;
US$410.1 million or 67 percent. The Government and transport public enterprises would bear the cost,&#13;
estimated at US$108.7 million, of taxes and duties levied on works, consulting services and goods.&#13;
Investments carried out by public enterprises and listed in the program are those for which Government&#13;
guarantee is required although the PEs will service the debt. Investments, such as for REGIFERCAM,&#13;
which will not service the debt, are listed as Government investments. Detailed program costs are provided&#13;
in Schedule 7. A summary breakdown of the program costs is given below.&#13;

3.42   On-going investmnents have been included in the program to start the process of globalizing the&#13;
approach in ternis of transport sector investment. It is also to take into account projects that have been&#13;
prepared in line with the new transport sector strategy as well as to reflect efforts made by the Government&#13;
and donors to adapt these projects to the sector program approach. On-going projects in line with the new&#13;
transport sector strategy include the Road Maintenance Project financed by EU and the Transport Sector&#13;
Technical Assistance Project financed by EU, FAC, BMZ and IDA. As an exarnple of on-going projects&#13;
which were adjusted, supply of road maintenance equipment under the AfDB highway project was modified&#13;
to focus on equipment used for routine maintenance and supply of heavy equipment was canceled. Also, a&#13;

dredger to be purchased under a BMZ project is being redesigned to make it simpler and more coherent&#13;
with the privatization of dredging underway. The container terminal modernization project financed by&#13;
OECF was also downsized to adjust to the diminution of port traffic. All these modifications are also&#13;
expected to result in a decrease of recurrent costs.&#13;

3.44   IDA Contribution to the Sector Investment Program. The proposed contribution would consist in&#13;
the following components:&#13;
(a)     Execution of a three-year time-slice of the maintenance program on primary roads of the&#13;
priority network: During the first year, rehabilitation or periodic maintenance will be&#13;
executed on 915 km  (300 km  paved, 615 kn unpaved).  Rehabilitation and periodic&#13;
maintenance requirements for the second and third year of the time-slice will be determined&#13;
on the basis of the road maintenance programming mechanism being established under two&#13;
on-going studies financed by IDA for earth roads and by Germany for paved roads under&#13;
the Transport Sector Technical Assistance Project. All roads are part of the priority&#13;
network.&#13;
(b)     Execution of a rural transport infrastructure maintenance program: The program aims at&#13;
rehabilitating about 1,500 km within the 10,952 km priority network of rural roads, and at&#13;
involving beneficiaries in the management of rural transport infrastructure.&#13;
(c)     Construction of two weighing stations, the first on the RN3 road at the exit of Douala, the&#13;
second on the RNI road between maltam and Kousseri.&#13;
(d)     Purchase of data processing supplies and equipment of related offices.&#13;

(e)    Provision of technical assistance and consulting services: (i) assistance during the&#13;
restructuring of the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Transport, especially for&#13;
the establishment of a planning mechanism and for the improvement of human resource&#13;
management; (ii) execution of a plan to improve road safety; (iii) supervision of civil&#13;
works execution; (iv) execution of a sensitization program to involve beneficiaries in the&#13;
management of rural transport infrastructure; (vi) preparation of an action plan to develop&#13;
the international trucking industry; (vii) detailed engineering studies for the preparation of&#13;
further time-slices of the sector investment program; (viii) project audits and&#13;
implementation completion report.&#13;
(f)    Training to support MINTP's and MINT's restructuring, the execution of a plan to&#13;
improve road safety, the implementation of the new maintenance strategy for rural roads,&#13;
development of SMEs in the road maintenance sector, and to strengthen the Merchant&#13;
Shipping Department in environmental concerns.&#13;
(g)    Surveys and seminars, including annual consultation between sector stakeholders,&#13;
Government and donors, and as part of the Systematic Client Consultation process.&#13;
D. TECENICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAIIING AND SEMINARS&#13;
3.45   Although there is no common strategy yet among donors regarding technical assistance and&#13;
training, there is a growing awareness of the need to reduce long-term technical assistance. Currently, long-&#13;
term technical assistance consists of: (a) one adviser to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Public&#13;
Works financed by FAC; (b) one adviser to the customs department financed by FAC; (c) several&#13;
consultants to manage the on-going road maintenance project financed by EU: the purpose of the project&#13;
was not to build local capacity to manage such projects but to encourage the emergence of small and&#13;
medium enterprises through a pilot operation, transitory between previous projects where road maintenance&#13;
was executed by force account and future projects where it will be executed by SMEs; the lessons learned&#13;
from this operation were used in the design of the present program; and (d) one adviser to the paved roads&#13;
department financed by BMZ, which can be considered as substitute to local staff. Additional long-term&#13;
technical assistance would be financed by: (a) EU to assist the regional and national committees in UDEAC&#13;
countries to implement the TIPAC system; and (b) AfDB to strengthen MATGENIE's management&#13;
capacity; the Government and AfDB agreed that this assistance should be designed consistently with the&#13;
process of State divestiture of equipment rental activities. Other technical assistance identified in the&#13;
program would consist in short-term missions, studies or assignments which require capacity that is not&#13;
found or insufficient in Cameroon.&#13;
3.46   The Government and donors are making efforts to promote local consultants. A review of local&#13;
consulting capacity in auditing, accounting and data processing was initiated by three donors (CFD, CIDA,&#13;
UNDP) and APECCAM (Association Professionnelle des Etablissements de Credits du Cameroun) in&#13;
1993. A similar review of local capacity in transport and public works will be carried out under the&#13;
Transport Sector Technical Assistance Project. A market of consulting services is developed in parallel&#13;
with the development of local public works SMEs to sustain the development of local consulting firms.&#13;
3.47   The IDA credit would finance 414 person-months of consulting services to support institutional&#13;
development and to assist in project implementation (Table 8) at a cost of about US$5.4 million.&#13;
Consulting services would consist in detailed engineering studies and supervision of works (200 person-&#13;
months), studies (64 person-months) and short-term missions (150 person-months).&#13;

3.48   The list of consulting services to be financed by the credit and the most important terms of&#13;
reference were agreed at appraisal. The list would be regularly reviewed and updated, if necessary in the&#13;
course of IDA's supervision missions, and in light of studies' outcomes, and of developments in the sector.&#13;
Draft terms of reference are presented in Schedule 8. When appropriate, they will be revised to indicate&#13;
that transfer of know-how is expected in the core output, and evaluation of consultants by the counterparts,&#13;
and of the counterparts by consultants should be made. Performance of consultants will be reviewed to&#13;
determine how assignments' objectives were achieved and how well consultants were able to transfer skills&#13;
and know-how to their counterparts, and to strengthen the local agencies to which they were assigned.&#13;
Counterparts should be designated before the start of major consulting assignments, with qualifications and&#13;
ternns of reference acceptable to IDA, and should remain in post until the completion of the activity, in&#13;
accordance with the strategy regarding counterparts adopted under the Transport Sector Technical&#13;
Assistance project (TSTA). These counterparts will be responsible for preparing seminars related to&#13;
project activities and for presenting papers on the conclusions and recommendations of studies. Terms of&#13;
reference will detail tasks to be carried out by the counterpart staff as part of their training. Consultants'&#13;
proposals should include the time necessary to train counterparts during execution of studies, and the&#13;
corresponding budget.&#13;
3.49   Training needs to support the restructuring of MINTP are being defined under an on-going study&#13;
financed by the TSTA project. Training in procurement, civil works supervision and environmental issues&#13;
in road maintenance will be carried out under the TSTA project. Additional training will be carried out&#13;
under the TSP. Training needs to support the restructuring of MINT will be defined under a study to be&#13;
launched as part of the TSTA project. Training in the civil aviation sector, maritime sector, meteo sector,&#13;
and on the restructuring of the Ministry will be carried out under the TSTA project. Additional training&#13;
will be carried out under the TSP. Training activities to support the rehabilitation of the customs&#13;
computerized system and the training strategy to develop SMEs in the road maintenance sector are&#13;
described in Schedule 9. Total cost of training to be financed from the credit is estimated at US$3.1&#13;
million.&#13;
E. PROGRAM ILEMENTATION&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.50   Procurement procedures are not actually harmonized among donors. However, the Transport&#13;
Interninisterial Coordination Unit (para. 3.75 below) uses IDA standard documents for the selection of&#13;
consultants for other donors as well. IDA standard bidding documents were also used in the preparation&#13;
for the tender of civil works in the Douala port channel although the Government decided to postpone the&#13;
execution of the works after 2000. The creation of the Ministerial Tender Board in MINTP should&#13;
harmonize the decision-making process in procurement and prevent the creation of various ad-hoc&#13;
committees at the request of donors. The following paragraphs describe procedures to be used for&#13;
procurement of works and goods and selection of consultants under the IDA credit.&#13;
3.51   During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to the procurement procedures described hereafter.&#13;
Goods and works will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). Consultants will be selected in accordance with the Guidelines&#13;
&#13;

Procurement of Civil Works&#13;
3.52   Contracts estimated to cost US$ 500,000 equivalent or more per contract for the rehabilitation of&#13;
paved and earth roads will be awarded based on ICB in accordance with IDA's procurement guidelines.&#13;
All ICBs will be advertised in national newspapers and in Development Business. Bank Group's standard&#13;
bidding documents shall be used. A 7.5 percent margin of preference may be granted in the evaluation of&#13;
bids to domestic contractors.&#13;
3.53   In order to achieve the project's objective of promoting national small and medium enterprises,&#13;
about 5 contracts estimated to cost less than US$500,000 equivalent per contract for earth road&#13;
rehabilitation up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$1.7 million equivalent will be awarded based on&#13;
NCB in accordance with IDA's procurement guidelines. There is adequate local capacity among local&#13;
contractors and enough competition is expected from them at competitive prices which would justify NCB.&#13;
Foreign bidders will not be excluded from participating in NCB. Standard bidding documents shall be&#13;
used. They shall be reviewed and approved by IDA before their use.&#13;
3.54   Rehabilitation of rural transport infrastructure will be limnited to critical spots. Contracts will be&#13;
scattered in nine districts to be carried out over a project period of 4 years and it is difficult to package&#13;
them for bigger lots. Contract amounts are estimated to range between US$2,000 and US$250,000. They&#13;
will therefore be awarded based on NCB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                   Transport Sector Project&#13;
3.55   Contracts specifying completion time more than 18 months will provide for a price adjustment&#13;
clause. All bids will be opened in public. Evaluation criteria will be included in the standard bidding&#13;
documents. Contract negotiation will not be permitted. The contract will be awarded to the lowest&#13;
evaluated responsive bidder.&#13;
Employment of Consultants&#13;
3.56  In order to ensure the satisfactory execution of the project, the Borrower agreed during&#13;
negotiations that qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment of consultants shall&#13;
be satisfactory to IDA. The model letter of invitation issued by the Bank Group shall be used. For&#13;
complex, time-based assignments, and lump-sum contracts, the Borrower will employ such consultants&#13;
under contracts, using the standard form of contract for consultants' services issued by the Bank Group,&#13;
with such modifications as shall have been agreed by IDA. Where no relevant standard contract documents&#13;
have been issued by the Bank Group, the Borrower will use other forms agreed with IDA prior to inviting&#13;
proposals.&#13;
3.57   Following the recommendations of the Country Procurement Assessment Report issued in April&#13;
1994, which concluded that procurement practices in Cameroon were inadequate, and to enable a&#13;
satisfactory procurement process, the following measures were agreed during negotiations:&#13;
(a)    Short-lists shall be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 firms with no more than two&#13;
firms from the same country.&#13;
(b)    The practice of requesting bid, performance securities and other retention guarantees shall&#13;
be discontinued.&#13;
(c)    Quality shall be the main criterion for the selection of consultants.&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
3.58   Goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 equivalent or more per contract will be&#13;
procured by ICB. Tenders will be advertised in a national newspaper and in Development Business. Use&#13;
of standard bidding documents is mandatory. Goods estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$208,000 equivalent may be procured under contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of NCB, advertised locally, in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA,&#13;
including: (a) bids will be opened in public in the presence of bidders or their representatives; (b) there will&#13;
be no negotiation with bidders between bid opening and contract award; (c) bid evaluation and post-&#13;
qualification criteria will be defined in precise quantitative and monetary terms; and (d) award will be made&#13;
to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder. For ICB, a 15 percent margin of preference may be granted in&#13;
the evaluation of bids offering domestically manufactured goods.&#13;
Review by IDA of Procurement Decisions&#13;
3.59   Prior review by IDA of bid and contract documents will be required for all consultants' services,&#13;
civil works contracts above US$200,000 equivalent (about 32 contracts) and goods contracts above&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent (one contract).&#13;
&#13;

Additional Arrangements&#13;
3.60   Contracts will be awarded within the agreed bid validity period and only exceptionally, bid validity&#13;
extension may be requested. In the case of fixed price contracts, requests for second and subsequent&#13;
extensions will be permissible only if the request for extension provides for an appropriate adjustment&#13;
mechanism of the quoted price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs for the contract over the period of&#13;
extension.&#13;
Procurement Times&#13;
3.61   Procurement processing times for major steps up to contract signing were agreed during&#13;
negotiations. For consultants, time between the transmission of the letter of invitation and the deadline for&#13;
the submission of proposals should not be less than 45 days. Time between the deadline for the submission&#13;
of proposals and contract's signature should not exceed 120 days. For goods and works, time between&#13;
notification of the tender or availability of bidding documents, whichever is later, and deadline for&#13;
submission of bids should not be less than 45 days. Time between the opening of bids and contract's&#13;
signature should not exceed 120 days. A first General Procurement Notice was issued after negotiations.&#13;
General Procurement Notices will be updated annually.&#13;
DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.62   Schedule 7 provides the estimated annual financial commitments for the overall sector investment&#13;
program during the 1995/1996-1999/2000 period. Actual disbursements should take place on a period&#13;
longer by at least one year. Based on the assumption that a commitment will be disbursed by 30 percent&#13;
the first year, 50 percent the second year and 20 percent the third year, the disbursements would be as&#13;
follows:&#13;

3.64   The Government will finance taxes, including TCA (Taxe sur le Chiffre dAffaires), and duties on&#13;
all contracts. Counterpart funds will be deposited on a Primary Roads Account in a commercial bank prior&#13;
to the signature of any works contract financed from the credit. This account will be audited as part of the&#13;
project activities. All contracts will be established including taxes and withdrawal applications will identify&#13;
TCA. The mid-term review (para. 3.81) will assess the overall Government contribution to the project and&#13;
revise disbursement percentages accordingly.&#13;
3.65   To facilitate disbursements and to ensure that funds are available on time to finance the costs of&#13;
services to be provided under the project, the Government will establish a Special Account in a comnmercial&#13;
bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The Special Account will be managed by Caisse&#13;
Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), the Government debt management agency, while withdrawal&#13;
applications will be prepared by the Transport Interministerial Coordination Unit. The authorized amount&#13;
of the Special Account is CFA 250 million. Requests for replenishing the account will be submitted to IDA&#13;
monthly or at such intervals as IDA shall specify.&#13;
3.66   Disbursements will be made against standard Bank documentation, except for contracts of less&#13;
than US$100,000 for civil works and less than US$50,000 for consultants and goods, for which certified&#13;
statements of expenditure would be used. These statements of expenditure will be subject to review by&#13;
supervision missions and periodic financial audits. The minimum application size for payments directly&#13;
from the credit account will be US$50,000.&#13;
3.67   The credit is expected to be disbursed on a 6-year period. Based on an expected effectiveness in&#13;
December 1996, the closing date would be December 31, 2002. This is two-year less than the standard&#13;
disbursement profiles for the transportation sector in Cameroon (see following graph). A shorter period is&#13;
justified by the execution of maintenance works, which are simpler than new road constructions executed&#13;
under the previous IBRD highway projects. In addition, the process is underway to select consultants&#13;
which will carry out the detailed engineering studies, assist MINTP in the bidding process to award the&#13;
civil works contract, as well as supervise the works.&#13;

ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
3.68   The Transport Interministerial Coordination Unit (TICU) will consolidate data on program costs&#13;
and disbursements in order to ensure accurate cost analysis for annual planning. The following paragraphs&#13;
describe the disbursement procedures for the IDA credit.&#13;
3.69   Accounting. TICU will maintain records and accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with&#13;
sound accounting practices, the operations, resources and expenditures in respect of the IDA credit.&#13;
Accounting procedures will be defined in a manual prepared by the unit, to be part of the Project&#13;
Inplementation Plan (para. 3.76) and to be agreed by IDA before effectiveness.&#13;
3.70   Auditing.  The signature of a contract with the project auditors is a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness. During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to:&#13;
(a)    have the records and accounts referred to in the preceding paragraph including those for&#13;
the Special Account year for each fiscal audited, in accordance with appropriate auditing&#13;
principles consistently applied, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA;&#13;
(b)    furnish to IDA as soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the end&#13;
of each such year, a certified copy of the report of such audit by said auditors, of such&#13;
scope and in such detail as IDA shall have reasonably requested; and&#13;
(c)    furnish to IDA such other information concerning said records and accounts and the audit&#13;
thereof as IDA shall from time to time reasonably request.&#13;
3.71   For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Credit Account were made on the&#13;
basis of statements of expenditure, the Borrower shall:&#13;
(a)    maintain or cause to be maintained, in accordance with paragraph 3.69, records and&#13;
accounts reflecting such expenditures;&#13;
(b)    retain, until at least one year after IDA has received the audit report for the fiscal year in&#13;
which the last withdrawal from the Credit Account or payment out of the Special Account&#13;
was made, all records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills, receipts and other documents)&#13;
evidencing such expenditures;&#13;
(c)    enable IDA's representatives to examine such records; and&#13;
(d)    ensure that such records and accounts are included in the annual audit referred to in&#13;
paragraph 3.70 and that the report of such audit contains a separate opinion by said&#13;
auditors as to whether the statements of expenditure submitted during such fiscal year,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                                         Transport Sector Project&#13;
together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be&#13;
relied upon to support the related withdrawals.&#13;
PROGRAM AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.72   The transport sector reform program would be implemented on a long-term (more than 3 years)&#13;
period, to reflect the limited capacity of implementation, the order of priority of the reforms and the various&#13;
progress either in their preparation or in the decision-making process within the Govermnent. The matrix&#13;
of action in Schedule I details the implementation schedule of the transport sector reform program and&#13;
identifies the entities responsible for this implementation. The matrix is summarized in table 11.&#13;

divestiture of transport public enterprises, and for the restructuring of customs and computerization of the&#13;
customs information system. MINT will be responsible for the definition and implementation of policies&#13;
and regulations and for planning in the transport sector. In the road sector, this will require a close&#13;
collaboration with MINTP, for example regarding the regulation of truck overload and the planning of road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3 -Transport Sector Program                                                  33&#13;
works. MINT in collaboration with sector PEs will be responsible for the planning of investments carried&#13;
out by public enterprises, when the State guarantee is required. Public enterprises will responsible for the&#13;
execution of these investments.&#13;
3.74 MINTP will be responsible for the public works component of the project and other related&#13;
activities. In the sector, there is a general agreement among donors that DGTC should no more be involved&#13;
as executing agency. With respect to the proposed IDA credit, the Government agreed during&#13;
negotiations that MINTP would be solely responsible for the road rehabilitation and maintenance&#13;
component. Thus DGTC shall have no investment execution responsibilities under the Project, nor any&#13;
procurement responsibilities except those allowed under the Borrower's procurement code.  The&#13;
Government is considering a revision of the institutional framework for NGOs to take into account their&#13;
increasing role in the country's economic development. Should the revision authorize NGOs to become&#13;
executing agencies for projects, such arrangements would be implemented under the rural transport&#13;
infrastructure component of the project.&#13;
3.75   The existing Transport Interministerial Coordination Unit which helped the Government prepare&#13;
the reform program, will continue its coordinating role between externally-financed projects. TICU is well&#13;
accepted by most donors. It will also be responsible for reporting progress in the execution of the reform&#13;
program, and consolidating financial data on the execution of the investment program. In collaboration&#13;
with MINEFI, MINT and MINTP, TICU will prepare annual stakeholders' meetings to assess progress in&#13;
the execution of the reform program. CAA will manage the IDA credit.&#13;
3.76   A Program Implementation Plan will be prepared to help the project coordinator implement and&#13;
monitor the project. The Plan will be distributed to all executing agencies. The plan would include all&#13;
procedures agreed with donors, standard bidding documents for works, goods and consultants, the list of&#13;
goods and semces to be procured and the type of procurement, detailed program costs, the terms of&#13;
reference of the studies and support services to be carried out, and standard forms for progress reports.&#13;
The IDA section of the plan should be completed as a condition of credit effectiveness. The sections&#13;
related to the other donors should be completed as part of the program.&#13;
3.77   The Program Implementation Plan will include an implementation schedule for the activities&#13;
covered by the program. A draft schedule is provided in Schedule 10 for the implementation of activities&#13;
supported by the IDA credit. It was prepared on the assumption that the credit would become effective in&#13;
December 1996. The project would be completed over a five and a half-year period on June 30, 2002.&#13;
REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
3.78   Program implementation as well as success in achieving program objectives will be evaluated and&#13;
monitored through a two-fold process:&#13;
(a)    Sector stakeholders, the Government and donors will participate in annual meetings&#13;
organized to: (i) review adherence to the agreed sector development strategy and progress&#13;
in implementation of policy measures; and (ii) update the transport component of the&#13;
Public Investment Program and determine new financing requirements.&#13;
(b)    Systematic Client Consultation will be carried out to obtain feedback from beneficiaries on&#13;
the improvement of road maintenance, at various stages of the rural transport&#13;
infrastructure maintenance program (choice of itineraries, type of works, level of&#13;
satisfaction), and during the preparation of additional policy measures in the transport&#13;
sector.&#13;
3.79   Reporting. The content and timing of progress reports was agreed during negotiations. A draft&#13;
standard form of progress report is available in project files. The final form would be included in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                                   Transport Sector Project&#13;
Project Implementation Plan. With respect to the IDA credit, progress reports would be prepared quarterly&#13;
and in advance of each IDA's supervision mission. The reports would review progress on financial&#13;
execution and studies. The Borrower would submit an Implementation Completion Report to IDA no later&#13;
than six months after the closing date of the credit.&#13;
3.80   Supervision Plan. IDA staff input into the supervision of the project would take the following&#13;
form:&#13;
(a)    Portfolio Management. Procurement documents and project-related reports (progress,&#13;
final, studies, financial statements) would be reviewed at IDA headquarters.&#13;
(b)    Field Supervision. Missions would: (i) review the progress in project inplementation,&#13;
execution of civil works and consultants' services; (ii) discuss outcome of the Systematic&#13;
Client Consultation to monitor project's impact; and (iii) monitor key project performance&#13;
indicators and compare these indicators to agreed targets (Schedule 11).&#13;
(c)    Donor Coordination. Every year, IDA will participate in a coordination meeting attended&#13;
by sector stakeholders, Government representatives and donors. The objectives of these&#13;
meetings would be: (i) to follow up on the implementation of the transport sector reform&#13;
program, on compliance with the Letter of Sector Policy and targets established in the&#13;
matrix of action; and to agree on necessary adjustments and additional steps; and (ii)&#13;
review the execution of the sector budget and investment program and agree on an updated&#13;
program financing plan.&#13;
A supervision plan for the 1997-2001 IDA fiscal years is proposed in Schedule 12.&#13;
3.81   Mid-Term Review. Not later than December 31, 1998, the project coordinator in the Transport&#13;
Interninisterial Coordination Unit should prepare and hold a mid-term review of the project execution. The&#13;
review would be organized in collaboration with the Administration, public enterprises, IDA's supervision&#13;
mission, and representatives of donor agencies involved in the transport sector. The review process would&#13;
include progress in meeting project's objectives, overall project perfonmance against established and agreed&#13;
key performance indicators. The mid-term review would provide the opportunity for IDA to assess the&#13;
Government's continued commitment to the project's objectives and the reform in the transport sector.&#13;
During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to the carrying-out of a mid-term review and to its objectives.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
Port Rehabilitation&#13;
3.82   Environmental protection of the Wouri river which gives access to the port of Douala, of the&#13;
Douala port area and coastal waters will be improved by the implementation of an Action Plan for port&#13;
environmental protection. Preparation of the plan and implementation of key recommendations are&#13;
supported by the IDA credit. A summary environmental assessment was carried out under the Transport&#13;
Sector Technical Assistance Project. In addition to the impact of dredging (see para. 3.83), environmental&#13;
concerns are related to:&#13;
(a)    Pollution of water due to urban wastes. Urban wastes are disposed in the channel and are&#13;
the major cause of pollution. This issue should be addressed as part of the rehabilitation&#13;
of the sewage system.&#13;
(b)    Oil pollution generated by ships, refineries, and oil plants. This issue requires a revision of&#13;
the regulation as well as an improvement of the capacity of the institutions (Ministry of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3 -Transport Sector Program                                                   35&#13;
Environment, Department of Merchant Shipping (DMS) in MINT) to monitor the pollution&#13;
and enforce the regulation.&#13;
(c)    Fire hazards due to hazardous materials. The port authority is preparing an emergency&#13;
plan.&#13;
3.83   An environmental assessment of dredging activities did not qualify environmental impacts as&#13;
adverse. The following impacts will be monitored as part of the project activities:&#13;
(a)    Salinity intrusion. Although salinity intrusion might result from the rehabilitation of the&#13;
access channel, which would increase its depth from -5.8m to -7.5m, this has not been a&#13;
problem in the past, when the channel depth was at -7.5m.&#13;
(b)    Aquatic fauna. Dredging is not expected to create major disturbance in the existing&#13;
maritime habitats. The aquatic fauna is already distributed over the estuary according to&#13;
the salinity rate and should adapt to the evolution of the rate. Dredging may improve the&#13;
quality of the habitats by replacing silt by sand.&#13;
(c)    Disposal of dredged materials. No contamination of the silt in the channel has, thus far,&#13;
been noted. Should the on-going analysis carried out under the TSTA project validate the&#13;
analysis carried out in 1990, dredged materials can continue to be safely dumped in the&#13;
deep sea in the outer channel. Refuse and waste generated by Douala and its industries,&#13;
which are disposed in the channel and may pollute dredging materials, should be treated as&#13;
part of the rehabilitation of the sewage system.&#13;
3.84   The IDA credit would provide assistance to the Department of Merchant Shipping (DMS) in&#13;
MINT: (a) to revise the institutional framework and the share of responsibilities between DMS and the port&#13;
authority; (b) to strengthen DMS's capacity to prepare regulation related to environment and monitor its&#13;
implementation. This would include preparation of the signature of the MARPOL convention by the&#13;
Cameroonian Government and implementation of the convention.&#13;
Road Rehabilitation&#13;
3.85   A mitigation plan to address environmental issues in road maintenance is being carried out under&#13;
the Transport Sector Technical Assistance Project. The plan will include guidelines for the integration of&#13;
environmental considerations in the design, implementation and monitoring of road rehabilitation projects.&#13;
A seminar will be organized to disseminate the mitigation plan and the guidelines.&#13;
PROGRAM BENEFITS&#13;
Poverty Alleviation&#13;
3.86   The program will address the issue of inadequate infrastructure, which is one of the key concem to&#13;
urban and rural communities identified in the participatory poverty analysis (PPA) carried out in early&#13;
1994. The adverse impact of poor transport infrastructure on the poor have been identified in paras. 2.3 to&#13;
2.5 above. Appropriate infrastructure maintenance is the third element of the food security strategy which&#13;
is aimed at the rural poor and where the key objective is to enhance production and to link more efficiently&#13;
produces to markets. The impact of the transport sector investment programn on the poor will be monitored&#13;
during project execution through several indicators (number of villagers in the area of influence of the rural&#13;
roads rehabilitated, number of markets, health centers, and schools to which the access is improved).&#13;
3.87   Labor-intensive methods have many benefits: (a) they provide a cost-effective altemative to&#13;
equipment-based methods for appropriate rehabilitation and maintenance tasks, especially since the CFA&#13;
devaluation; (b) they generate employment for both men and women; (c) they save in foreign exchange and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                    Transport Sector Project&#13;
inject cash in the local economy; (d) they facilitate the use of local materials; (e) they transfer the&#13;
knowledge of road maintenance execution methods to local communities; and (f) they have environmental&#13;
advantages.&#13;
3.88   The road component of the project should mitigate the short-term impact of the restructuring of&#13;
public enterprises and ministries on employment. The increased amount of financing for road maintenance&#13;
will create employment opportunities. The promotion of the local construction industry should also have a&#13;
favorable impact on the labor market, which has been stagnant since 1987. Development of labor-based&#13;
methods will provide employment opportunities for unskilled workers. Emerging SMEs will provide new&#13;
opportunities for educated people, for which unemployment has increased from 1.5 percent in 1983 to 30&#13;
percent in 1993. The number of person-days generated by the road works included in the program is&#13;
estimated at 15.5 million, equivalent to about 10,000 jobs during three years. This is about 2,000 jobs&#13;
more than those which are expected to be lost in the transport sector after restructuring the public&#13;
enterprises and the ministries. About 3.5 million person-days would be generated by the IDA contribution&#13;
to the program equivalent to 2,000 jobs during three years. The number of person-days generated by the&#13;
transport sector investment program will be monitored during program execution.&#13;
Program Contribution to Improved Efficiency and Sustainable and Coherent Development of the&#13;
Transport Sector.&#13;
3.89   Road Maintenance. Without the program, road infrastructure would continue to deteriorate and its&#13;
worsening condition would aggravate the adverse impact on the poor. Producers' profits would decrease&#13;
because of the increase in transport costs combined with the stagnation of produce prices on the local&#13;
market due to the economic crisis. The competitiveness of export products would decrease or local&#13;
producers would lose their incentive to produce. In the absence of donors' contribution to the road&#13;
maintenance program, development of local small and medium enterprises would lack sustainability and the&#13;
risk would increase of shifting back to execution of road maintenance by inefficient and unaccountable&#13;
force account. Resources would be largely insufficient and would be inefficiently used by giving priority to&#13;
costly rehabilitation on a small number of roads or by being scattered all over the network for political&#13;
reasons making it impossible in both cases to maintain the road network in a sustainable manner. In&#13;
addition, all rural road programs would be canceled, such programs being almost entirely financed by&#13;
donors. The on-going programming study will provide a comparison between various maintenance&#13;
strategies depending on traffic, road condition, and other parameters. The results will have to be&#13;
continuously adjusted thereafter to take into account the budget constraint.&#13;
3.90   The fiscal impact of the road maintenance program has not been quantified. Although revenues&#13;
from fuel taxes collected from the existing traffic are expected to decrease because of the reduction of&#13;
vehicle operating costs due to the improvement of road condition, additional revenues will be generated by&#13;
the induced traffic as well as by the economic activities induced by the improvement of road condition. In&#13;
addition, it is desirable to reduce the current high level of taxation on road transport which hampers the&#13;
overall competitiveness of the economy. This is consistent with the fiscal reform prepared under the SAC&#13;
which aims at simplifyring and streamlining the rate structure, broadening the tax base and reducing&#13;
distortions. The simplification of the road taxation system (para. 3.11) aims at these objectives as well as&#13;
at improving tax recovery.&#13;
3.91   Privatization and Liquidation of Priority Public Enterprises. After privatization, CAMAIR,&#13;
REGIFERCAM, CAMSHIP and CAMTALNER are expected to generate profits due to a more&#13;
autonomous and commercially-oriented management, cost-cutting, and financial restructuring resulting in&#13;
greater competitiveness. Subsidies should be stopped resulting in savings for the Treasury. In addition,&#13;
after privatization, the enterprises will generate fiscal revenues which they have not done for several years.&#13;
Accumulated savings for the Treasury three years after privatization/liquidation compared to the without&#13;
privatization/liquidation scenario, would amount to US$60 million, and would be equivalent to the&#13;
additional cost borne by the State for the restructuring (table 12, details are in Schedule 2).&#13;

3.92   Port Restructuring and Rehabilitation. This component of the program aims at improving the&#13;
overall competitiveness of the economy. Port tariffs should decrease as a result of the streamlining of the&#13;
port authority. Contracting out of dredging would result in better efficiency and increased depth of the&#13;
channel would save waiting-time for the ships entering the channel or leaving the port (see economic&#13;
justification below). The costs of maintenance dredging would be fully recovered from shipping lines&#13;
through a specific port duty.&#13;
3.93   Regulatory Framework. Progressive liberalization of maritime transport, simplification of the road&#13;
taxation system, revision of the transport component of the price structure for petroleum products, as well&#13;
as other measures mentioned above would result in a reduction of transport costs and greater&#13;
competitiveness of the country's economy. As an example, in CMte d'Ivoire, liberalization of maritime&#13;
transport cut prices of maritime transport for bananas by half.&#13;
3.94   Transit. The rehabilitation of the computerized customs declaration system in Douala would&#13;
improve customs revenues by reducing fraud. The new procedures to be implemented to accompany the&#13;
rehabilitation would make the system more efficient, and save time in the transit of goods through the port.&#13;
Implementation of the transport component of the UDEAC Program of Regional Reforms, including the&#13;
TIPAC system, would make transit procedures more efficient, and reduce the cost of non-factor services on&#13;
transit goods.&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
3.95   Rehabilitation of Primary Roads. The main benefit of the component would be a more efficient&#13;
and cost effective transport system. The maintenance works carried out under the project will reduce&#13;
vehicle operating costs and their timely execution will postpone a costly reconstruction. Because there are&#13;
no regulatory obstacles in the transport market, road users are expected to pass to shippers and consumers&#13;
most of savings they will derive from the improved network.&#13;
3.96   In the scenario "with project", the road maintenance strategy is based on several criteria: (a) level&#13;
of service of the road; (b) traffic volume; (c) geotechnical aspects (relief, type of soil); and (d)&#13;
climatological conditions. To take into account the scarce resources available for road maintenance,&#13;
standards and norms of maintenance have been adjusted downwards in departure from the high standards&#13;
previously applied in Cameroon. Elements on the strategy, norms and standards, unit prices and cost-&#13;
benefits flows are provided in Schedule 13. The rate of return obtained by applying the strategy to the&#13;
priority network is well above 40% (Table 13). Such high rates of return are justified because they are&#13;
calculated for an overall road maintenance program, including routine maintenance, periodic maintenance&#13;
and rehabilitation on roads in good, fair, poor and very poor condition. Results are based on costs before&#13;
the January 1994 devaluation. The strategy and its economic evaluation are being updated after&#13;
devaluation as part of the on-going road maintenance progranuning study carried out under the Transport&#13;
Sector Technical Assistance Project.&#13;

3.97   A first-year program of road works was appraised. Roads were chosen within the priority network&#13;
on the basis of their national importance and their poor condition. The earth-road program is consistent&#13;
and complementary with a program which began in 1993 with EU financing. The rate of return is 74&#13;
percent for the overall program, 100 percent for earth roads and 52 percent for paved roads. Details on&#13;
the calculation are provided in Schedule 14. Results from sensitivity analysis are shown in the following&#13;

3.98   Rehabilitation of Rural Roads.  Roads included in the project will be detennined after&#13;
consultation with the beneficiaries, but will have to be selected within the 10,952 km priority network&#13;
agreed by the Government on the basis of the economic justification of the maintenance works. Benefits&#13;
calculated in the economic analysis were derived from savings in transport costs, increase in agricultural&#13;
production, and reduction of product losses during transport. The average rate of return of the maintenance&#13;
works on roads within the priority network is 36 percent (see schedule 15). The economic analysis was&#13;
carried out in 1987 and updated in 1990 in order to prepare an action plan for the development of rural&#13;
roads. It has not been updated since then because of the difficulty and the high cost to obtain reliable&#13;
information on the condition of the entire 28,000 kn-long rural roads network, on the population living&#13;
along the rural roads, and on the agricultural production. Consultation with beneficiaries should prevent&#13;
major discrepancies between the rural roads included in the program and the most economically important&#13;
roads.&#13;
3.99   Rehabilitation of the Channel. The benefits of the project are derived from savings in maritime&#13;
transport costs resulting from an increased number of turnarounds per ship, reduced waiting time for high&#13;
tide to enter the channel, reduced waiting time at berths and reduced costs of ship calls. Schedule 16&#13;
provides the assumptions and the outcome of the economic analysis. Five scenarios (channel depth at&#13;
-6.5m, -7.0m, -7.5m, -8.0m, -8.5m) were compared to the existing situation (channel depth at -6.0m).&#13;
Three assumptions were made for the cost of maintenance dredging after rehabilitation (CFAF2,000/m3,&#13;
CFAF2,500/m3, CFAF3,000/m3). Three traffic scenarios were considered:&#13;
Table 15: 1995-2010 Average Annual Port Traffic Growth&#13;
Scenario Mini Medium Scenario Scenario Maxi&#13;
Import Traffic      0.1%             1.2%            1.8%&#13;

one, which indicates that the project is   &gt; o                            -4-/CFAF2,0001m3&#13;
largely justified. The net present value is   ' as-/CFAF2,6001n3&#13;
maximum at a -7.5m depth. The following    U. 8      _                    --CFAF3,0001m3&#13;
chart presents the net present value of the   z t  3 0.&#13;
benefits generated by the dredging in the   2    2 I                  4&#13;
minimum-traffic scenario. The net present      6.6    7    7.5   8    3.5&#13;
value at -7.5m  remains positive when                Channel Depth (m)&#13;
benefits are reduced by 50 percent assuming&#13;
that all benefits gained by foreign shipping lines are not transferred to the Cameroonian economy.&#13;
3.101 The rehabilitation of the channel was compared to the construction of dikes which would accelerate&#13;
water flows, increase auto-dredging and decrease maintenance dredging requirements. The net present&#13;
value is higher for the rehabilitation than for the calibration when the cost of maintenance is CFAF2,000&#13;
per cubic meter. It is slightly lower when the cost of maintenance is CFAF2,500 or 3,000 per cubic meter.&#13;
The preference given to the rehabilitation is justified by this uncertainty on the cost of dredging and by the&#13;
large difference between the investment costs of the two alternatives estimated at US$76 million for the&#13;
calibration and US$13 million for the rehabilitation at a depth of -7.5 meters which does not result in a&#13;
significant difference between the benefits estimated for both alternatives.&#13;
3.102 Other Investments.&#13;
(a)    Air Transport: The rehabilitation of the Douala airport was included in a CFD credit&#13;
provided to Cameroon to accompany the privatization of management of five major&#13;
airports in 1994. The detailed engineering study needs to be carried out to estimate the&#13;
cost of the operation. The capacity of the airport management company to service the debt&#13;
following this investment will be assessed when the cost is estimated.&#13;
(b)    Rail Transport: The feasibility studies for the modernization of telecommunications and&#13;
the rehabilitation of the track are to be launched as part of the Transport Sector Technical&#13;
Assistance Credit.  Modemization of the telecommunications and rehabilitation of&#13;
Yaounde-Kaa are included in two on-going projects financed by BMZ.&#13;
(c)    Port: The feasibility study for the modemization of the container terminal was carried out&#13;
in 1990. The rate of return of 10 percent was expected to be attained with a container&#13;
traffic above 100,000 TEUs (ton equivalent units). The container traffic has continuously&#13;
decreased since 1991 and was of 67,285 containers in 1994. The project has been subject&#13;
to several revisions and its technical content is not definitive yet. It is financed by a 1987&#13;
OECF loan. The rehabilitation of berths, aprons and carriageways and the extension of&#13;
the timber storage area have no financing and have not been subject to feasibility studies&#13;
yet. The studies should be carried out before the financing of the investments is confirmed.&#13;
Investments in equipment have not been subject to an economic analysis but to a financial&#13;
analysis (see below).&#13;
(d)    Customs: The experience in other countries hints at a significant increase in Govemment&#13;
revenues, as well as at a reduction of transport costs due to reduced delays resulting from&#13;
inproved procedures. A more detailed assessment of financing requirements than the&#13;
estimate provided in this report should be carried out and subject to economic analysis.&#13;
The restructuring of customs and the modemization of the computerized management&#13;
information system have no financing yet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                                                      Transport Sector Project&#13;
ONPC's Financial Perspectives&#13;
3.103 A financial evaluation of the port authority (ONPC) was carried out to assess its capacity to&#13;
absorb financially its investrnent plan (Schedule 5) and to service the debt. The investment plan includes&#13;
on-going projects (purchase of a new dredger and a tug-boat, rehabilitation of the carriageways,&#13;
implementation of a computerized management information system, modernization of the container&#13;
terminal) as well as new projects (channel rehabilitation; berth rehabilitation; purchase of a service boat;&#13;
equipment, building and warehouse rehabilitation; and extension of the timber storage area). The financial&#13;
analysis was carried out assuming three traffic scenarios as in the economic analysis, five self-financing&#13;
percentages of new investment, two interest rates corresponding to concessional and commercial&#13;
borrowing. A sensitivity study assumed a 20-percent increase in the investment cost. Detailed results are&#13;
available in the Project File. Schedule 17 provides during the 1995/1996-2010/2011 period the annual&#13;
income statement for the base case, assuming a minimum traffic growth of 0.6 percent annually, a 40&#13;
percent self-financing, concessional borrowing and the current tariff structure, and cash-flow statements for&#13;
scenarios assuming two traffic growths, two self-financing percentages, two interest rates and an increase&#13;
in investment costs by 20 percent.&#13;
3.104 Under the base case, the port would generate sufficient cash-flow to contribute by 40 percent to the&#13;
financing of the investment program. Commercial borrowing would result in a negative net income starting&#13;
in 1999 and a negative net cash flow starting in 2006. The outcomes of the financial evaluation in the base&#13;
case scenario as well as in the sensitivity analysis, however, evidence the inefficiencies of the current cost&#13;
and tariff structure as indicated in para. 2.21. To improve this situation and preserve the financial viability&#13;
and competitiveness of the port, the port needs to implement the action plan described in para. 3.32 starting&#13;
by completing the implementation underway of the cost accounting and management information system.&#13;
PROGRAM RISKS&#13;
3.105  Lack of Government commitment is a risk common to the overall transport sector reform program,&#13;
and the Government may be inclined to delay implementation of the adjustment measures because of the&#13;
risk of social unrest. This risk is mitigated by the adoption of the reform program by the Government and&#13;
its internalization during the long preparation process. The absence of such program was among the causes&#13;
for the failure of the institutional component in the previous transport projects (para. 4.3). Government is&#13;
also aware that delays in the implementation of adjustment measures would have negative consequences on&#13;
the recovery of the economy. These consequences would be worsened by donors becoming reluctant to&#13;
provide financial support to the Government. Progress in the implementation of the transport reform&#13;
program will be closely monitored. Beneficiaries will be consulted during the program implementation to&#13;
generate a constituency for reform. Annual meetings will be organized with participation of sector&#13;
stakeholders, the Government and donors to assess reform implementation and define action plans in order&#13;
to meet reform targets.&#13;
3.106 Lack of local resources due to the current financial constraints is also a risk for the program,&#13;
should counterpart funds to externally-financed projects be insufficient. In the specific case of IDA's&#13;
contribution to the transport reform program, the risk of insufficient counterpart funds will be mitigated by:&#13;
(a)    Making a satisfactory macro-economic framework a condition for presentation of the IDA&#13;
credit to the Board: The Credit is presented to the Board after an agreement was reached&#13;
between the Government, the IMF and IDA and after a new Structural Adjustment Credit&#13;
was approved by the Board of the Association on February 8, 1996.&#13;
(b)    Improving the resource allocation process: The Government will be requested to deposit&#13;
the counterpart funds for any works contract financed from the credit on a project account&#13;
in a commercial bank prior to the signature of the contract (para 3.64). This is expected to&#13;
reduce the unit prices of the civil works contracts and increase the quantities of works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3 -Transport Sector Program                                                     41&#13;
which can be carried out with given resources compared to the quantities of works&#13;
estimated based on current unit prices, therefore is expected to be an incentive for the&#13;
Government to provide the counterpart funds.&#13;
3.107 The risk of insufficient resources to finance recurrent costs is a second risk related to the current&#13;
financial constraints. This risk will be progressively mitigated in the road maintenance sector by&#13;
establishing reasonable and sustainable targets in view of the financial constraints, by progressively raising&#13;
these targets, and by linking external donor's financing of road civil works to the Government meeting these&#13;
targets (para. 3.25). Timely allocation of funds and execution of maintenance contracts in accordance with&#13;
the targets would be a condition for IDA financing subsequent slices of road maintenance works. Improved&#13;
planning, a more transparent use of funds resulting from the creation of the Road Maintenance Account,&#13;
and a satisfactory macro-economic framework will also alleviate the risk of insufficient resources to&#13;
finance recurrent costs. The second risk will be mitigated in the port sector by increasing involvement, in&#13;
the management of the port authority, of port users, which have an incentive to maintain the channel, and&#13;
by creating a transparent mechanism to collect revenues and to pay dredging maintenance executed by&#13;
contract.&#13;
3.108 Other risks identified are related to:&#13;
(a)    Economic Justification of Investments Included in the Project: To mitigate the risk of&#13;
executing investment with a negative net present value, the economic analysis for each&#13;
investment will be updated on the basis of cost estimates resulting from the procurement of&#13;
contracts. Consistency will be verified between road rehabilitation works proposed in the&#13;
program and the outcome of the on-going planning and programming study. Rehabilitation&#13;
standards will be reduced if necessary to provide a positive net present value. Annual&#13;
traffic counts are included in the TSTA project to provide recent traffic data to update the&#13;
economic analysis, the programming of works, as well as assess the project justification&#13;
after completion. These arrangements will be included in the program implementation&#13;
plan.&#13;
(b)    Rural Transport Infrastructure: The risk is that improvement of rural transport&#13;
infrastructure will not benefit women although women are responsible for most transport&#13;
activities in the household. Load carrying is considered women's work. Entrenched&#13;
cultural and attitudinal barriers need to be overcome to prevent this attitude to prevail.&#13;
The risk will be mitigated by carefully paying attention to include women into the planning&#13;
and consultation process for the establishment of the rural transport infrastructure&#13;
program. A sociologist will be included in IDA's supervision team to ensure that&#13;
representative groups will be consulted and key target groups will benefit from the training&#13;
and sensitization program related to the participation of communities in rural transport&#13;
infrastructure management.&#13;
(c)    Privatization of PEs: (i) CAMAIR: Some actors in the Government are still reluctant to&#13;
accept the proposed restructuring of air services in Cameroon, and have still to be&#13;
convinced that new market-based air services will be viable. The proposal to engage an&#13;
interim management team to manage airline operations commercially with full autonomy&#13;
while a new market-based air service is being set up, constitutes an interim and realistic&#13;
solution to avoid a protracted debate with the Government on up-front full liquidation of&#13;
CAMAIR. It would satisfy the immediate political objective of maintaining the flag&#13;
carrier as a national symbol. (ii) REGIFERCAM: The risk is that potential private&#13;
investors might be uninterested in operating the railway. Should privatization appear&#13;
impossible, the situation would have to be reassessed in order to agree on the parameters&#13;
under which the company could continue to operate with a minimum of subsidies. (iii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                                                                  Transport Sector Project&#13;
CAMSHIP, CAMTAINER: Several potential investors have expressed interest in&#13;
investing in CAMSHIP. Should the privatization be unsuccessful, however, the company&#13;
should be given full autonomy as indicated in the Cameroonian Law on Public Enterprises&#13;
enacted in 1995 and would have to compete and survive or disappear on a market which is&#13;
going to be liberalized as part of the transport sector reform program. Should the&#13;
privatization of CAMTAINER fail, the company should be liquidated due to the presence&#13;
of private competitors on the market.&#13;
(d)    Restructuring of PEs (ONPC, MATGENIE, LABOGENIE): The risk is that the&#13;
restructuring be not implemented or that it fail. Implementation of restructuring depends on&#13;
the Government commitment (see para. 3.105 above). In the case of ONPC, the second&#13;
risk is mitigated by the involvement of private operators in ONPC's Board of Directors.&#13;
In the case of LABOGENIE, the impact of failure would be mitigated by the opening of&#13;
the market for road laboratory works to private competitors. In the case of MATGENIE,&#13;
the risk of failure is mitigated by distributing it among several entities to be progressively&#13;
privatized.&#13;
(e)    Financing of severance payment: Lack of financing is a risk of delay in the execution of the&#13;
restructuring and privatization program mentioned above. Mitigation of this risk is among&#13;
the measures to mitigate the risk of failure of the overall adjustment program.&#13;
(f)    Transit: The risk is that the transport component of the UDEAC Regional Policy Reform&#13;
Program be stalled for several reasons: (i) difficulties for the UDEAC countries to&#13;
coordinate a reform program that has to be implemented in several countries; (ii)&#13;
obstruction because of the inefficiency or vested interests in customs; and (iii) difficulty to&#13;
find the expertise required to support implementation of the TIPAC. These risk can hardly&#13;
be mitigated by specific countermeasures. Competition between countries, especially the&#13;
reopening of the Congolese itinerary which can be used for the transit of Central African&#13;
Republic goods should be an incentive for Cameroon to improve its transit procedures.&#13;
This incentive, however, remains weak as shown by the competition between Cameroon&#13;
and Nigeria for the transit of Chadian goods which has had no effect on procedures in&#13;
Cameroon. The macro-economic incentive is likely to be the stronger for Cameroon, due&#13;
to the necessity to restructure and make customs more efficient, which would benefit to the&#13;
land-locked countries.&#13;
(g)    Environmental Impacts: Although, as mentioned above, no major adverse environmental&#13;
impact is expected, a monitoring procedure will be put in place in order to take preventive&#13;
mitigation measures when necessary.&#13;

Chapter 4 - IDA Assistance Strategy to the Transport Sector                            43&#13;
4.  IDA ASSISTANCE STRATEGY TO THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST EXPERIENCE&#13;
4.1    Structural Adjustment. Experience in PE restructuring under the Structural Adjustment Program&#13;
(SAP) underlines the importance of State divestiture from PEs in commercial sectors, and implementing a&#13;
satisfactory institutional framework to ensure such divestiture. Performance contracts used to restructure&#13;
PEs under the SAP failed because of a lack of commitment from both Government and PEs. Privatization&#13;
and liquidation operations launched at the same time also failed for the same reason, and because of an&#13;
unsatisfactory institutional framework.&#13;
4.2    Projects in the Transport Sector. Since 1970, the Bank Group has contributed to transport sector&#13;
development in Cameroon, with 13 projects totaling US$500 million equivalent. Projects were mostly in&#13;
the highway (75 percent of the amount lent), railway, and port subsectors. Ten projects were audited after&#13;
completion. Five transport sector memoranda provided the sector analysis to prepare the projects.&#13;
4.3    Although the audit reports observed that the Bank's objectives for the sector had been "consistent,&#13;
sound and transparent, improving efficiency and strengthening self-financing operations", it concluded that&#13;
while, generally, all physically measurable targets were successfully met, no comparable success was&#13;
registered in the areas of financial performance, maintenance activities, and institution building. The audits&#13;
attributed the poor institutional and financial performance of the transport sector to the Government's lack&#13;
of commitment to genuine change and, more importantly, to the lack of a coherent sector program. The&#13;
audits underlined that the Bank had advocated a comprehensive program, and that its absence had meant&#13;
that individual subsector operations were neither integrated nor additive. The 1989 audit of the Feeder&#13;
Roads, Highway IV, and Railway projects concluded that an overall sectoral approach was overdue, and&#13;
recommended preparation of an action program pursuing a coherent approach of sector investment&#13;
planning and PE reform, and the adoption of this program by Government and donors as a basis for&#13;
integrated sector financing.&#13;
4.4    These lessons have led to IDA contributing to the preparation of a Transport Sector Reform&#13;
Program, described above, which places transport sector development and investment in a policy-based,&#13;
sectorwide framework supported by Government and donors. The preparation of this program was a&#13;
critical contribution to Cameroon's efforts to restore the performance of its economy and competitiveness.&#13;
The Government and IDA carried out a joint economic and sector work to analyze issues in the transport&#13;
sector in order to devise action plans and priorities to restore sector efficiency (Transport Sector&#13;
Memorandum, dated June 30, 1993, Report No. 11430-CM). The process for sector analysis, and the&#13;
preparation of the Transport Sector Reform Program, aimed at internalizing the rationale for reform and&#13;
recommendations by broadly involving Government institutions and staff, private operators and donors. To&#13;
marshal the necessary understanding and political commitment needed to implement the proposed reforms,&#13;
a Transport Interministerial Group was created to represent all Government organizations involved in the&#13;
transport sector. Several seminars were organized to discuss with the private sector the reform in the road&#13;
maintenance, port, transit and maritime subsectors. The Government also called several donor meetings to&#13;
discuss sector issues and action plans. The Government intends to organize a donor meeting to present its&#13;
declaration of policy for the transport sector, the matrix of actions to implement this policy and the&#13;
investment plan to support this implementation. MINEFI is coordinating the preparation of this donor&#13;
meeting with meetings in other sectors, which could be consolidated in a single Consultative Group&#13;
meeting.&#13;
4.5    The most recent Implementation Completion Report (Six Highway Project, Ln. 2584-CM)&#13;
indicated the following additional lessons:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44                                                         Cameroon - Transport Sector Project&#13;
(a)    Road Maintenance Organization: When the sector lacks strong leadership and commitment&#13;
to efficiency and accountability, the role of the institution in charge of road maintenance&#13;
needs to be concentrated on planning, programming, budgeting and supervising road&#13;
maintenance works. Work execution should be contracted-out to achieve better efficiency&#13;
and adequacy between the program of works and available resources. Financing of inputs&#13;
as done under the Sixth Highway Project should definitely be discarded.&#13;
(b)    Project Design and Implementation: To continue in a direction which has become&#13;
inappropriate is likely to result in poor implementation and performance and lack of&#13;
achievement of the project objectives. In such a case, the project ought to be adjusted or&#13;
restructured where necessary.&#13;
(c)    Technical Assistance, Capacity Building and Human Resource Development: Technical&#13;
assistance should be provided in an environment which is committed to building on the&#13;
expertise thus provided. This requires a strong leadership capable of developing and&#13;
implementing a human resource development strategy. Capacity building has to be&#13;
considered on a long-term basis. Training is most useful when immediately applicable in&#13;
the day-to-day work environment.&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
4.6    The proposed program is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The CAS was&#13;
discussed by the Board in conjunction with the SAC on February 8, 1996. It is designed to draw Cameroon&#13;
out of its current fiscal impasse and to progressively bring the economy onto a path of higher and&#13;
continuous growth. The Government and IDA agreed that long-term development can only be achieved by&#13;
substantially improving fiscal perfonnance in order to generate additional resources to finance priority&#13;
development expenditures and to cover debt service obligations. IDA assistance will thus concentrate on:&#13;
(a) stabilizing public finance and improving public sector efficiency; (b) creating an environment conducive&#13;
to private sector development; and (c) targeting poverty alleviation. The strategy was based on a Public&#13;
Expenditure Review conducted in April 1995, a Poverty Assessment carried out in April 1995, a Private&#13;
Sector Assessment to be completed in FY96 and a National Education Forum held in May 1995.&#13;
4.7   IDA's participation in the program will help achieve the CAS's objectives by: (a) contributing to&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization through divestiture of transport public enterprises aimed at reducing the drain&#13;
on the budget caused by subsidies and at increasing fiscal revenues generated by the profit-making public&#13;
enterprises after privatization; (b) promoting a favorable environment for private sector development by&#13;
revising the institutional framework in the public works' subsector, and shifting road maintenance&#13;
execution from force account to contract; and (c) alleviating poverty by developing labor-intensive methods&#13;
in road maintenance works and promoting participation of beneficiaries in sector management.&#13;
4.8   Four main reasons justify IDA involvement in the transport sector:&#13;
(a)    Because of the importance of the transport sector in the economy, the transport reform&#13;
program is at the core of adjustment. Therefore, IDA involvement in the transport sector&#13;
will strengthen the macroeconomic adjustment supported by the adjustment credit which&#13;
was recently approved.&#13;
(b)   IDA has built a wealth of experience in all aspects of transport management and services&#13;
delivery outside as well as in Cameroon. The Government will benefit from this&#13;
experience through IDA involvement in the seftor.&#13;
(c)   IDA presence in the sector has been and will continue to be catalytic among the donor&#13;
community. Although most donors support the sector-wide approach taken by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 4 - IDA Assistance Strategy to the Transport Sector                          45&#13;
Government to prepare the transport reform program, this support remains fragile. The&#13;
chance of success of the reform program will increase if encouraged by donors coordinated&#13;
and committed by culture to the sector-wide approach involving donor coordination.&#13;
IDA's withdrawing from the sector would send to other donors active in the sector an&#13;
unjustified negative message on the capacity and commitment of the Government to carry&#13;
out its reform program.&#13;
(d)    The dialogue with the Cameroonian Government would be jeopardized would IDA&#13;
withdraw from the transport sector after several years of discussion on the transport sector&#13;
reform program and when the Government is committed to the transport sector reform and&#13;
expresses financing needs in support of the reform, that cannot be entirely fulfilled by&#13;
other donors. IDA's withdrawing would weaken those in the country who support the&#13;
reform and reduce the chance of success of the reform.&#13;
4.9    Although some Government decisions on the transport sector reform program are still pending, and&#13;
the ways some decisions taken by the Government are going to be implemented are still to be established,&#13;
the proposed project is justified by an overall satisfactory status of the reform process. Most important&#13;
decisions were taken by the Government, such as on the State divestiture of operations executed by public&#13;
enterprises. Liquidation of SOTUC shows the Government commitment to the implementation of its&#13;
decisions. Several other reforms will be implemented in the short term, such as contracting out the&#13;
dredging of the Douala port access channel and sale of public participation in CAMSHIP and&#13;
CAMTAINER. Other reforms to be implemented in the longer term are well underway, such as the&#13;
privatization of air and rail services. Postponement of the project until additional reforms are implemented&#13;
would unnecessarily increase the burden on the economy caused by the poor condition of infrastructure and&#13;
put the implementation of the program at risk by not providing the much needed financial relief to&#13;
accompany the short-term adverse impact of the reform.&#13;
C. IDA's ASSISTANCE STRATEGY TO THE TRANSPORT SECTOR.&#13;
4.10  IDA would assist the Government in implementing the transport sector reform program through&#13;
several instruments:&#13;
(a)    Transport Sector Technical Assistance Credit (Cr. 2703-CM, April 11, 1995): The credit&#13;
provided support in policy preparation, institutional development and helped to prepare the&#13;
sector investment plan. It finances the financial advisers who assist the Government in the&#13;
privatization or liquidation of CAMAIR, REGIFERCAM, CAMSHIP, CAMTAINER and&#13;
SOTUC. It will continue to accompany the implementation of the transport sector reform&#13;
program through various training activities, seminars, and provide additional technical&#13;
assistance to continue to prepare reforms that are going to be implemented on a long-term&#13;
period. The project status is summnarized in Schedule 6.&#13;
(b)    Transport Sector Project: The project will support the road maintenance component of the&#13;
sectoral investment plan and, in conjunction with the Transport Sector Technical&#13;
Assistance Credit, reform implementation in the road maintenance subsector.&#13;
(c)    Enterprise Divestiture and Competition Credit (FY97): The proposed credit would support&#13;
State divestiture of public enterprises including the civil aviation company and the railway&#13;
company.&#13;
(d)    Social Development Credit (FY98): The proposed credit would support poverty alleviation&#13;
through measures to stimulate growth and through a program of targeted interventions&#13;
which would include urban labor intensive civil works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Schedule 1: Letter of Sector Policy and Matrix of Actions&#13;
I/     INTRODUCTION&#13;
a)     Cadre macro-economique&#13;
Dans le cadre du Programme de Relance Economique, le Gouvemement camerounais a adopte un&#13;
nouveau programme de r6formes au niveau des politiques, des institutions et des allocations des ressources,&#13;
pour restaurer la comp6titivite de 1'economie et, ainsi (i)inverser son d6clin et celui de la pauperisation de&#13;
ses populations de ces huit demi&amp;res ann6es,(ii) r6tablir les equilibres macro-6conomiques, intra-sectoriels&#13;
et financiers et (iii) sortir de la crise economique que connait le pays.&#13;
Ce progranmme de reformes comporte quatre volets essentiels, A savoir: (i) le realignement de la&#13;
parit6 du franc CFA aux fins de ramener le taux de change effectif reel A un niveau compatible avec le&#13;
retablissement des 6quilibres macro-economiques et une croissance 6conomique durable; (ii) I'adoption&#13;
d'une politique de gestion de la demande interieure qui permette de juguler l'inflation, une fois effectu6s les&#13;
ajustements des prix resultant de la d6valuation; (iii) la reduction de l'intervention de l'Etat dans l'economie&#13;
et (iv) la poursuite du processus de liberalisation du commerce exterieur et 1'61imination de toutes les&#13;
contraintes pesant sur le libre fonctionnement des marches de l'emploi des biens et des services. Ce&#13;
programme de r6formes consacr6 dans le memorandum du Gouveonement de Mai 1994, marque un&#13;
tournant par rapport aux politiques menees dans le passe et qui, malgre certains progres, n'ont pu sortir le&#13;
pays du declin economique dans lequel ii est plonge depuis le milieu des anndes 1980. Il vise aussi a&#13;
corriger les desequilibres internes et a restaurer un climat propice au retour a la croissance.&#13;
Le programme de reformes a recu l'appui du F.M.I. dans le cadre du 4eme accord de confirmation&#13;
de septembre 1995, de la Banque Mondiale avec le cr6dit d'ajustement structurel approuv6 en f6vrier 1996&#13;
ainsi que d'autres bailleurs de fonds par des prets A l'ajustement structurel.&#13;
b)     Depenses publiques et investissements publics&#13;
Le nouveau programme de reformes eablit les priorit6s en matiere de d6penses de fonctionnement&#13;
et d'investissement et alloue une plus grande proportion des ressources aux d6penses non salariales et&#13;
particulierement aux secteurs cruciaux pour le d6veloppement a long terme A savoir: I'eucation, la sante,&#13;
I'agriculture et l'entretien des infrastructures de transport.&#13;
A cet egard une plus grande part des investissements publics devra etre financee sur des fonds&#13;
exterieurs et &amp;re orientee vers des secteurs porteurs de developpement, s6lectionn6s sur la base de criteres&#13;
stricts de rentabilite conomique en consultation avec la Banque Mondiale.&#13;
c)     R6forme des entroprises publiques&#13;
Le d6sengagement de 1'Etat des entreprises publiques par le biais de la privatisation ou la&#13;
liquidation, constitue aussi un element de ce programme.  Les entreprises qui resteraient dans le&#13;
portefeuille de l'Etat auront, du fait de ce d6sengagement, une tres grande autonomie de gestion.&#13;
d)     Dettes et arrier6s des ontreprises publiques&#13;
Les dettes et les arri6r6s des entreprises publiques, d6ja repris par le Gouvernement, doivent etre&#13;
traites globalement dans le cadre des accords conclus avec la Banque Mondiale et le F.M.I. Les autres&#13;
dettes, y compris les indemnites de licenciement des personnels de ces entreprises, devront 6tro traitees dlans&#13;
le cadre de leur privatisation ou liquidation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

50                                                           Cameroon - Transport Sector Project&#13;
e)     Mise en oeuvre du Programme de Relance Economigue&#13;
Le premiere phase du programme de relance economique vise au retablissement de 1'equilibre&#13;
mon6taire et fiscal, a la liberalisation des marches, aux encouragements a la production, pour soutenir la&#13;
croissance et reduire la pauvrete.&#13;
La deuxieme phase est basee sur des reformes structurelles dans les secteurs productifs,&#13;
particulierement l'agriculture, de facon a assurer l'augmentation des exportations dans un nouvel&#13;
environnement economique competitif&#13;
f)     Traduction du Programme de Relance Econonique dans le Secteur des Transports&#13;
Des reformes structurelles et financieres fondamentales doivent etre entreprises dans le secteur des&#13;
transports qui est un secteur clef de l'economie, indispensable a la relance.&#13;
En effet, le secteur des transports souffre d'une faible perfornance des institutions, d'une politique&#13;
privilegiant les investissements a 1'entretien et d'une allocation des ressources inadequate. L'absence de ces&#13;
reformes constituerait une contrainte majeure pour le programme de relance.&#13;
De plus, les principaux modes de transport presentent une faible efficacite et des couits eleves&#13;
resultant: (i) d'un entretien insuffisant des infrastructures et des equipements, et (ii) d'une detdrioration des&#13;
perfornances techniques et financieres des entreprises publiques du secteur, ce qui constitue un obstacle&#13;
majeur a la competitivite de l'economie et un lourd fardeau pour les finances publiques.&#13;
Le Gouvemement adopte la presente strategie pour l'ensemble du secteur des transports, en&#13;
coherence avec le programme de Relance Economique.&#13;
II/    STRATEGIE DU SECTEUR DES TRANSPORTS&#13;
a)     Objectif&#13;
L'objectif du Gouvemement est d'assurer une meilleure efficacit6 et un d6veloppement durable et&#13;
coherent du secteur des transports pour que celui-ci contribue a la croissance de l'economie du pays, a la&#13;
r6duction de la pauvret6 et a la protection de l'environnement.&#13;
b)     Strateie&#13;
La strat6gie pour atteindre cet objectif est: (a) d'am6liorer la gestion des politiques sectorielles en&#13;
redefinissant le r8le de l'Etat pour le desengager des operations transferables au secteur prive et le&#13;
concentrer sur les taches de planification, de reglementation et d'laboration des politiques, (b) d'equilibrer&#13;
l'allocation des ressources entre investissements prudents et d6penses d'entretien en renfor,ant la capacitd&#13;
institutionnelle et en assurant une mobilisation permanente des ressources, (c) d'ameliorer l'efficacite du&#13;
secteur par une r6forme du cadre reglementaire visant la liberalisation, une meilleure competitivite et la&#13;
mise en place des mecanismes incitatifs de march6s et (d) de mettre en place une politique de protection de&#13;
l'environnement.&#13;
La strategie pour le secteur des transports est partie integrante et depend des programmes macro-&#13;
economiques et financiers y compris la strategie concemant les d6penses courantes, les investissements&#13;
publics, le nouveau cadre institutionnel du Gouvemement et le reglement des dettes et des arri6r6s des&#13;
entreprises publiques.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Schedule 1                                                                             51&#13;
III/ PROGRAMME SECTORIEL DES TRANSPORTS&#13;
Pour la mise en oeuvre de cette strategie, le Gouvemement a prepare un programme global, a&#13;
moyen terme a executer en plusieurs phases:&#13;
La premiere conceme la privatisation ou la liquidation des entreprises suivantes du secteur des&#13;
transports aerien, ferroviaire, urbain et maritime (CAMAIR, REGIFERCAM, SOTUC, CAMSHIP et&#13;
CAMTAINER), qui ont un grand impact sur l'efficacit6 du systeme des transports et les finances&#13;
publiques. Cette phase porte egalement sur la liberalisation du transport urbain.&#13;
La deuxieme phase portera entre autre sur:&#13;
1-    Un programme de rehabilitation du reseau routier, du chenal d'acces au port de Douala, du&#13;
chemin de fer et de l'outil portuaire,&#13;
2-    Un programme d'entretien de ces infrastructures de transport faisant recours a une plus&#13;
large privatisation de l'execution des travaux, au developpement des techniques a haute&#13;
intensite de main d'oeuvre et, pour l'entretien routier, a la definition d'un reseau prioritaire.&#13;
3-    Le desengagement de l'Etat du Matgenie et la restructuration du Labogenie et sa mise en&#13;
concurrence.&#13;
4-    La clarification des missions et la reorganisation des Ministeres charges des routes et des&#13;
transports.&#13;
5-    La restructuration de l'ONPC pour ameliorer les perfomiances portuaires et assurer les&#13;
services au moindre cout.&#13;
6-    La redefinition des missions du CNCC dans le sens d'un meilleur appui aux chargeurs.&#13;
7-    La liberalisation du transport maritime et du transport aerien.&#13;
8-   La facilitation du transport en transit dans le cadre du Programme R6gional de R6forme de&#13;
l'UDEAC.&#13;
9-    Une mise en coherence des differentes reglementations avec le programme de reformes.&#13;

62                                                          Cameroon - Transport Sector Project&#13;
Schedule 4: Action Plan to Overhaul the Customs System&#13;
1.    Proposals Concerning Personnel.&#13;
*      Organization of a seminar for senior Customs staff, focusing on remotivation and exercise of&#13;
leadership. Sensitization to professional ethics, preparation of disciplinary actions. Initiation to&#13;
management methods and preparation of performance charts. Participation by external specialists&#13;
(IMF, French Cooperation, IDA).&#13;
*      Campaign to ensure personnel are informed regarding behavior and its consequences in the&#13;
disciplinary arena: general information memorandum distributed to each staff member and&#13;
organization of meetings on the topic of discipline in all units, to be addressed by the office and&#13;
unit chiefs.&#13;
*      Publication in the media of the first results of the discipline campaign, and distribution of an&#13;
information memorandum to staff enumerating and detailing the cases considered. Disciplinary&#13;
assessment of all staff, both permanent and contract personnel.&#13;
*     Training plan for contract staff and for those engaged in surveillance.&#13;
2.    Proposals Concerning Organization.&#13;
*      tReactivation of supervisory structures; Inspectorate staff must participate in the actual supervision&#13;
of the services and propose both technical improvements and disciplinary action for flagrant cases.&#13;
*     In the context of the new organization chart of the Customs Directorate, a senior supervisory&#13;
officer responsible for "policing" the services should be assigned to the sector chiefs (equivalent to&#13;
regional or provincial directors). The first position created should be that of Douala. A temporary&#13;
alternative could be to assign members of the Inspectorate staff to detached duty in the sectors, on&#13;
the twofold condition that the officers thus detached not be "unwanted rejects" and that they be&#13;
provided with the necessary means (vehicles, gasoline, per diem).&#13;
*     Review of the draft new organization chart to consider:&#13;
* the need for reviewing the organization of the port of Douala (3 or 2 offices?);&#13;
* the actual workload of the services;&#13;
* the limitation on higher-level positions.&#13;
The reorganization project studied should not be viewed as a reduction of services to obtain a&#13;
larger number of management positions but as a concentration of resources on the points of&#13;
significance in terms of efficiency and budget performance, as regards both available staff (public&#13;
service constraint) and means (limited budget of the Customs).&#13;
*     Revision of the structure of the Douala services to prevent formation of a bloc outweighing the&#13;
Directorate.&#13;
Restudy of the port and airport offices' workload as measured by computerized means.&#13;
3.    Proposals Concerning Customs Computerization.&#13;
In addition to the highly technical proposals presented in the specific report on Pagode by the&#13;
technical assistant assigned to the Customs by French Cooperation, the following proposals should&#13;
be adopted:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Scheduk 4                                                                               63&#13;
Restoration of the terminals and essential links in the port and airport, particularly for manifests&#13;
and inspection in the port.&#13;
Production of daily statements of the services' activity and uncompleted operations.&#13;
Indication of duty and tax rates on declarations (will now be easier with application of the UDEAC&#13;
tariff, only four rates).&#13;
Progressive introduction of the computer module for selection of declarations, technical study and&#13;
choice of goods for streamlined inspection, establishment of a section for inspection guidance&#13;
staffed by officers from the inspection service and a section to handle admission on documents.&#13;
Progressive elimination of check-inspections and replacement by inspection structures (senior&#13;
inspection officer) assigned to the sector chief.&#13;
Creation of a task force made up of technicians and Customs officers to come up with proposals&#13;
for preparing the services for the new system.&#13;
Elimination of waiting time and study of future patterns.&#13;
Progressive implementation of the new patterns in preparation for the introduction of the new&#13;
computerized system.&#13;
Preparation of the specifications for the new computerized Customs clearance system.&#13;
Establishment of three or four control units based on the simple principle:&#13;
1 item unloaded = 1 manifest line = 1 declaration = 1 payment slip = 1 collection by means of&#13;
computerized and manual checking of manifests, by production and checking upon inspection of&#13;
declarations which have not yet been inspected or signed off, by verifying the signatures and&#13;
payment slips and by confirmation from the Treasury that payment has actually been made&#13;
(checking of slips against receipts).&#13;
*      Choice of inspection of goods on leaving warehouse or at the port gate; officers will no longer be&#13;
assigned to warehouses, which would free up 30 officers for assignment elsewhere; control of&#13;
outgoing goods could be based on declaration numbers and possibly computerized.&#13;
4.    Proposals Concerning Equipment.&#13;
*      In the context of the new computer options and the cost of essential rehabilitation work, transfer of&#13;
the services to more suitable premnises available in the immediate vicinity of the port should be&#13;
studied.&#13;
*      Special multiyear Customs reequipment program, 3 to 5 years, premises and equipment.&#13;
Specific effort by Finance Ministry and possibly donors for Douala as a priority, but also for the&#13;
most strategic points (major border offices).&#13;
*      Selection of data-transfer equipment, with emphasis on mobility of data rather than mobility of&#13;
staff.&#13;
Establishment of a radio network, provision of fax equipment for the major starting and crossing&#13;
points (particularly for transit traffic).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Reequipping of officers with weapons, truncheons, etc.&#13;
Reequipment with vehicles and motorcycles adapted for off-road use, pooling of vehicles and&#13;
surveillance of vehicle and cycle use to prevent private usage.&#13;
S.    Proposals for Maximizing Services Received Under the Contract with the Soci9te  Generale de&#13;
Surveillance (SGS).&#13;
Effective fbllow-up of abnornal cases reported by SGS.&#13;
Absolute obligation for inspectors to use at least the value indicated by SGS.&#13;
Performance by SGS of an additional random check of 20-39% of dossiers under the value&#13;
threshold to ascertain whether there has been excessive subdivision.&#13;
Improvement of the monitoring of coffee and cocoa exports by more frequent checks, and&#13;
elimination of the provisional declarations for wood.&#13;
Cancellation of specific exemptions from SGS checks granted to certain exporters.&#13;
Systematic weekly SGS-Customs coordination meetings, with official minutes to the Minister.&#13;
Provision of a Pagode terminal for SGS use for supervision of operations (observation without&#13;
intervention).&#13;
Ensuring security of the taking over of goods by assignment to SGS of the cargo and Pagode&#13;
manifests and the Customs clearance statements.&#13;
In the extreme case, transfer to SGS of the taking over of goods if the Customs does not&#13;
demonstrate its will in the matter within six months.&#13;
6     Miscellaneous Measures&#13;
Establishment of an emergency procedure for goods in transit to Chad and the CAR, with the aim&#13;
of reducing the hold-up time in the port of Douala from the present 30 days to 10 days.&#13;
Single bond for warehousing and temporary admission operations. Reduction of releases to banks.&#13;
Limitation or even elimination of the free point system, use of appropriate Customs systems.&#13;

the routine maintenance of their road system. This is accomplished as follows: (a) By conducting a local&#13;
prornotional campaign centered on the opportunities available to rural communities to obtain outside financing&#13;
and the criteria goveming eligibility for it. (b) An NGO that is well established in Cameroon and offers a wide&#13;
range of activities to local participants (missions, projects, existing groups, communities...) will be selected for&#13;
this promotional campaign. (c) Government experts from subdivisions of pilot zones will be included in the taget&#13;
groups to demonstrate the uniqueness of the content of the stategy.&#13;
-  By setting up and organizng local road maintenance commitees (CLER) as an expression of community&#13;
interest, so that they may receive technical and management training from the "operator-desiger" NGO, through&#13;
its representatives. Local road maintenance committees will set up their own organization, including statutes,&#13;
operating procedures, and so forth. They will advise the 'Vtrainer/sensitizer" NGO of the proposed roads for&#13;
which they are requesting outside financing.&#13;
Details on the target groups involved, information channels, primauy messages to convey, and an estimate of&#13;
the cost for promotional activities are provided in the project files.&#13;

Schedule 9                                                                            77&#13;
Schedule 9: Training&#13;
A. Support to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)&#13;
Available Experience&#13;
1.    A training program of SMEs was carried out under the Road Maintenance Program financed by&#13;
the European Union. This program consisted of:&#13;
(a)    Enterprise management and determination of prices during the period where bids were&#13;
prepared: The training was provided by a consulting firm.&#13;
(b)    Execution of civil works: The training was provided by the consulting firm supervising the&#13;
execution of the works.&#13;
2.    The use of foreign expatriates made the cost of training very expensive and unsustainable on a long&#13;
period. Therefore, a different approach is proposed:&#13;
(a)    A local training firm would be appointed to prepare a training program based on short&#13;
units (for example half an hour per theme).&#13;
(b)    The program would be prepared in consultation with the SMEs to determine the training&#13;
needs. It would be extended on the basis of new requirements identified by SMEs.&#13;
(c)    Training would be open to all SMEs and not only SMEs which have been selected to&#13;
execute works. SMEs would have to contribute to the cost of training.&#13;
(d)    Training would be carried out at a decentralized level. Regional NGOs would be appointed&#13;
to provide training to SMEs.&#13;
(e)    The local training firm would coordinate training activities carried out by NGOs. The&#13;
training firm would receive assistance from local consultants highway engineers.&#13;
(f)    A Steering committee would be created to monitor the implementation of the training&#13;
program. The committee would consist in representatives of the private sector (Syndicate&#13;
of civil engineers, private banks among others) and the public sector (Ministry in charge of&#13;
SMEs, Ministry of Public Works). The committee would be supported by short-term&#13;
experts (training specialist, highway engineer).&#13;
B. Restructuring of Customs&#13;
The project would include training of customs' agents both in technical computer-related skills and&#13;
in the new customs administration procedures being introduced in conjunction with the new computer&#13;
system. The training would focus on on-the-job training to improve capacity of customs' agents in overall&#13;
customs administration and operations, as well as enable customs' agents to participate in and assume&#13;
progressive responsibility in computer administration and operations, software maintenance and&#13;
enhancements, and communication management.&#13;
The information technology training would include:&#13;
(a)    project management, system analysis;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                                                         Cameroon - Transport Sector Project&#13;
(b)    hardware and system software operations, remote diagnostics, file back-up, network&#13;
configuration and management;&#13;
(c)    application software modalities and operations, programming logic and structure,&#13;
maintenance, and enhancement techniques;&#13;
(d)    database management; and&#13;
(e)    computer-based auditing techniques.&#13;

Schedule 14: Economic Evaluation of the First-Year Road Maintenance Program&#13;
1.      The economic evaluation was carried out using the H1DM  Model set up by the World Bank. For&#13;
each year of the economic analysis period, the model calculates the road deterioration due to the traffic and&#13;
the maintenance strategy applied to the road, the cost of the maintenance, and the vehicle operating costs&#13;
based on the new road condition. The model compares the total costs, including rehabilitation costs,&#13;
maintenance costs and vehicle operating costs, in the with- and without-project scenarios. Table 1 presents&#13;
the maintenance strategy in the with-project scenario. Table 2 presents key parameters of the economic&#13;
analysis and provides the Economic Rate of Retum and the Net Present Value for each road in the&#13;
program. Table 3 presents the cost-benefits flows. Table 4 presents the results of the sensitivity studies.&#13;

Schedule 15: Economic Analysis of the Rural Transport Infrastructure Program&#13;
1.     Three benefits were quantified in the economic analysis: (a) value added in new agricultural&#13;
production; (b) reduction in product losses during transport; and (c) savings in transport costs for both&#13;
normal and induced traffic other than resulting from (a) and (b). Several benefits were not quantified, such&#13;
as enhanced food security and enhanced ease of access to health services, extension and teaching.&#13;
2.     The first benefit is the most important in quantitative terms, as it represents about three fourths of&#13;
the benefits that the rural infrastructure program is expected to generate. Restricted access to areas of&#13;
agricultural production to inadequate infrastructure has three consequences: (a) during all seasons of the&#13;
year, but especially during the rainy season, farmers cannot conveniently access to their fields and are&#13;
unable to fully harvest their crops which are left to perish; (b) in areas where transportation has to be head&#13;
loaded, the quantities that can be taken out of the fields are limnited, which hamper on any desire to expand&#13;
production; and (c) the quality of the produce which reaches the markets is lower because produce was not&#13;
harvested in time or because of deficient transportation. The study assumed that the country's food&#13;
production would increase by 1.6 percent per annum without the program and 3.1 percent per annum with&#13;
the program. The percentage of value added per type of agricultural product and per type of road condition&#13;
is given in table 1.&#13;

3.     Induced traffic benefits account for an additional 15 percent of total program benefits. Induced&#13;
traffic is generated by increased non-farm earnings. As the mobility of small holder farming households&#13;
and small scale businesses increases through the availability of cheaper transportation and higher level of&#13;
transport services, added value will result from increased supply and demand of goods and services.&#13;
Demand for non-farm services which are important to the rural poor and are especially provided by women&#13;
include food processing, such as cooked snacks, processed roots, beverages, palm oil extraction, brewing,&#13;
and manufactured produce, which have low investment requirements. Also, demand for wage labor for&#13;
weeding, planting and harvesting, and fbr field leveling, ridging and preparation, should increase. So will&#13;
demand for farm inputs.&#13;

Schedule 16: Economic Evaluation of the Rehabilitation of the Access Channel&#13;
to the Port of Douala&#13;
1.     Benefits expected from the rehabilitation of the channel are the following:&#13;
(a)    for cargo ships, an increase in the average freight transported to and from Cameroon&#13;
resulting either in a reduced number of ships or in an higher occupancy ratio of ships, both&#13;
resulting in a reduction of the average maritime transport cost per ton of freight;&#13;
(b)    for tramps, an increase in the size of the ships resulting in a reduction of the average&#13;
maritime transport cost per tone of freight;&#13;
(c)    reduced waiting time bome by the ships when entering the channel or leaving the port;&#13;
(d)    reduced waiting time for berths.&#13;
2.     Key parameters of the economic study are:&#13;
(a)    Traffic: Three scenarios were considered.&#13;

(b)    Ships characteristics. 18 types of ships were considered.  Their characteristics vary&#13;
depending on the channel depth. The evolution between characteristics is progressive&#13;
depending on the type of ships. Detailed data are in the Project Files.&#13;
(c)    Transport costs: Costs were estimated at sea and at berth, depending of the size of the&#13;
ships. Detailed data are in the Project Files.&#13;
(d)    Waiting time for high tide and for berth. Detailed data are in the Project Files.&#13;
3.     Dredging costs include the rehabilitation cost and the annual maintenance cost. Quantities were&#13;
estimated on the basis of a physical model to simulate the channel.&#13;

Schedule 17: Financial Evaluation of ONPC&#13;
1.    The following tables assess ONPC's financial capacity to support its 1995/1996-2009/2010&#13;
investment plan. Three traffic scenarios were considered as in the economic study. Two rates of interests&#13;
were considered corresponding to concessional and commercial borrowing. Five assumptions were made&#13;
for the percentage of self financing (40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent and 85 percent). Port&#13;
tariffs are those of 1994 kept constant during the entire period of analysis. Table 1 presents the annual&#13;
income statement during the investment period in the minimum traffic scenario assuming concessional&#13;
borrowing and a 40-percent of self financing. Table 2 presents the annual net cash-flow assuming a 40&#13;
percent and 85 percent self financing, concessional and commercial borrowing, and a minimum and&#13;
medium traffic. An additional sensitivity study was carried out assuming a 20 percent increase in the&#13;
investment cost.&#13;
2.    In addition to the investment plan provided in Schedule 10, investments executed after 2000 consist&#13;
in the completion of berth rehabilitation started in FY99, construction of a new building for the harbor&#13;
master CFAF2.3 billion) and construction of dikes to calibrate the channel (CFAF40 billion). The income&#13;
statements are extrapolated from the FY94 data. They are conservative and do not assume any significant&#13;
reduction of the charges.&#13;
3.    The financial analysis was carried out with maintenance dredging costs for the optimum depth of -&#13;
7.5 meters estimated in the economic analysis. Maintenance dredging is expected to start in 1998. The&#13;
cost of dredging the channel including along the quays is estimated at CFAF4,768 million, CFAF2,373&#13;
mnillion above the operating cost of the dredger Youpwe used by ONPC to maintain the channel at its&#13;
current depth of -5.8m. The income statements do not take into account the impact of the reevaluation of&#13;
the assets to take into account the January 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc, as well as the impact of the&#13;
recent modification of the fiscal regime which suppress ONPC's tax exoneration and require ONPC to pay&#13;
a 16.5 percent tax on its revenues. If necessary, tariffs will have to be adjusted to reflect these&#13;
modifications. The debt service does not include current arrears estimated at CFAF5.3 billion. It is&#13;
assumed that after compensation of cross-debts between ONPC and the State, the remaining balance will&#13;
be affected to the capital.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Transport Sector Project aims at
            improved efficiency and sustainable and coherent development
            in the transport sector to enable it to resume its
            contribution to development, poverty alleviation and
            protection of the environment. These objectives will be
            achieved by: 1) state divestiture from transport operations
            in favor of a greater involvement of private operators, and
            institutions more focused on planning, regulation and
            definition of sector policies; 2) better balance in resource
            allocation between prudent investments and maintenance
            expenditures, and sustainable resource mobilization; 3)
            improved regulatory framework resulting in more
            liberalization, increased competitiveness and more
            competition; and 4) development and implementation of a
            sector policy to protect the environment. The project
            comprises the following components: 1) civil works on paved
            roads, unpaved roads, rural roads, port, and the rail and
            air transports; 2) goods; and 3) technical assistance and
            training. More specifically, the project will consist of: 1)
            execution of a three-year time-slice of the road
            rehabilitation and maintenance program and bridge
            maintenance program on primary roads of the priority
            network; 2) execution of a rural transport infrastructure
            maintenance program; 3) construction of two weighing
            stations; 4) purchase of data processing supplies and
            equipment of related offices; 5) provision of technical
            assistance and consulting services; 6) training; and 7)
            surveys and seminars.
