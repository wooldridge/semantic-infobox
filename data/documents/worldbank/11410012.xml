Foreword&#13;
The gap between funds available to water utilities            2.   Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company&#13;
and the demand for water infrastructure has grown.                 (Kenya)&#13;
There is therefore a need to facilitate the process&#13;
                                                              3.   National Water and Sewerage Corporation&#13;
of mobilizing additional funding for developing the&#13;
                                                                   (Uganda)&#13;
water sector and ensuring that these investments&#13;
result in sustainable service delivery. One of the key        4.   Office National de L'eau et de L'assainissement&#13;
actions taken in this regard has been to conduct                   (Burkina Faso)&#13;
credit ratings so as to develop a better understanding&#13;
of the credit worthiness water utilities in Africa. The       5.   Sènègalaise des Eaux (Senegal)&#13;
findings from a sample study are presented in this            6.   Sociètè Nationale des Eaux du Sènègal&#13;
regional report.                                                   (Senegal)&#13;
The analysis is based on data sourced from seven              7.   Société Nationale d'Exploitation         et   de&#13;
participating water utilities across five African                  Distribution des Eaux (Tunisia)&#13;
countries ­ Burkina Faso, Kenya, Senegal, Tunisia&#13;
and Uganda. The data is then used to calculate&#13;
proxies for industry statistics.&#13;
                                                             It is expected that the ratings process will be&#13;

than those available in the local market. These funds&#13;
are, however, characterised by long approval lead&#13;
times, frequent currency risks, and again onerous&#13;
loan covenants.&#13;
&#13;
The demand for infrastructure finance is to some&#13;
degree linked to its availability locally as well as to&#13;
competition between commercial and concessional&#13;
finance. However in Uganda the condition of potential&#13;
issuers is the key demand driver for infrastructure&#13;
finance.&#13;
&#13;
In Uganda the unreformed pension sector has led to&#13;
a concentration of liquidity with the National Social&#13;
Security Fund (NSSF). There are other smaller&#13;
pension funds that have also participated in bond&#13;
issuances in the past, but the NSSF has acted as&#13;
a de facto underwriter for most issues. Recently,&#13;
the NSSF has been engaged in an enquiry into&#13;
its investment decisions. This enquiry has left the&#13;
Fund without a functioning investment committee,&#13;
essentially removing the considerable liquidity it&#13;
holds from the market. Given the dearth of corporate&#13;
bond issues in the country, however, the appetite of&#13;
remaining investors for corporate and infrastructure&#13;
debt is considerable. But this short-term limitation&#13;
of NSSF's ability to invest in debt instruments may&#13;
limit the success of bond issuances in the country.&#13;
In the longer term, an unreformed pension sector&#13;
obviously poses a liquidity risk to potential issuers&#13;
of debt instruments.&#13;

the final workshop in Dakar, Senegal in November          financial viability.&#13;
2008. This is particularly encouraging given that the&#13;
financial sector in Africa has typically perceived the&#13;
water sector to be of a very high risk.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to this, given the current global financial&#13;
turmoil and re-assessment of lending criteria by&#13;
many international banks and/or donors, the&#13;
accordance of domestic currency ratings provides&#13;
the water utilities with an opportunity to source&#13;
funding domestically, thereby eliminating currency&#13;
conversion risk. While increased and ongoing&#13;
interaction between the water and financial sector&#13;
is required to better understand the various risks,&#13;
the progress made of late is very encouraging.&#13;
Global Credit Ratings (GCR) also notes that most&#13;
of the water utilities reviewed during this initial&#13;
credit ratings exercise were considering or already&#13;
in the process of raising debt funding through their&#13;
respective domestic capital markets.&#13;
&#13;
It is important that independent assessment through&#13;
credit ratings continues (water utilities must engage&#13;
directly with credit rating agencies to improve their&#13;
self assessment) so as to improve each utility's&#13;
credit rating and hence financial attractiveness to&#13;
investors. An annual review (or more frequently if&#13;
required) of each water utility's credit rating is also&#13;
crucial in terms of maintaining transparency through&#13;
regular monitoring, as well as widening the investor&#13;
base available to each entity. This is particularly&#13;
pertinent in light of the fact that the capital markets&#13;
in many African countries have excess liquidity&#13;
and are continuously seeking alternative long-term&#13;
investments. Finally, benchmarking of water utilities&#13;
across the African continent must continue so as&#13;
to enable continuous learning and improvement. It&#13;
is also hoped that the ratings and benchmarking&#13;
process will be extended to include additional&#13;

first 9 months of F08 is also noted. Finance charges&#13;
will remain low as finance is to be provided at low&#13;
interest rates, relative to the commercial market.&#13;
Although a portion of the AFD funding is to be&#13;
disbursed as grant funding, gearing levels are&#13;
expected to rise significantly over the next three&#13;
years. Moreover, the water board has a number of&#13;
pending project proposals for the development of&#13;
water sources and production capacity, although&#13;
funding for this has not been secured.&#13;

The operating budget predicts moderate water and&#13;
sewerage revenue growth over the three years to&#13;
F10, while grant income is expected to remain&#13;
unchanged at KShs86m. Although revenue&#13;
projections are deemed achievable assuming that&#13;
the current tariffs prevail, it is expected that&#13;
operating expenses are likely to exceed budget&#13;
(particularly staff costs). NCWSC project fairly&#13;
moderate increases in operating expenses, which&#13;
are not reflective of the planned operational&#13;
expansion. NCWSC projects borrowings to decline&#13;
to KShs14m in F08, from KShs888m in F07,&#13;
declining to zero in F09. This assumes the full&#13;
repayment of inherited debt in F08 as well as the&#13;
short    term     loan     of     KShs200m.     This&#13;
notwithstanding, cash flow forecasts suggest this is&#13;
not the case; with debt in fact remaining on balance&#13;
sheet (despite debt repayments of KShs213m and&#13;
KShs6m in F08 and F09 respectively). As reflected&#13;
in the balance sheet extract below, the company&#13;
expects the amount of trade receivables to increase&#13;
significantly, while a substantial drop in cash&#13;
holdings is projected. However, a significant&#13;
increase in payables is also forecast, implying the&#13;
withholding of amounts due to AWSB. Overall, the&#13;
company reflects a weaker liquidity profile over the&#13;
three-year period.&#13;

&amp;#12;Key challenges in achieving these objectives&#13;
include:&#13;
· Tariffs are structured whereby household&#13;
     consumers are in fact purchasing water below&#13;
     the cost of production, with profitability&#13;
     deriving from large-scale consumers (such as&#13;
     government and other commercial users) who&#13;
     are charged higher rates. As such, with the&#13;
     rollout of services being largely to&#13;
     households, this is likely to place further&#13;
     downward pressure on the sectors margins.&#13;
     Tariffs should be restructured such that&#13;
     households are purchasing water on a cost-&#13;
     reflective basis.&#13;
· Given government's stated intention of&#13;
     eventually moving away from direct&#13;
     investment in the water sector, establishing a&#13;
     transparent, indexed and long term pricing&#13;
     structure is crucial in order for ONEA to&#13;
     provide services in accordance with its&#13;
     mandate and to make the necessary long term&#13;
     plans with greater certainty. This requires co-&#13;
     ordination and buy in from all key roll&#13;
     players, particularly government.&#13;
· The inability of ONEA to implement a&#13;
     stringent credit collections policy (and cut off&#13;
     supply) to government entities is a concern,&#13;
     which needs to be addressed. This will, in&#13;
     turn, require the necessary political support&#13;
     from the government.&#13;
· Deteriorating exogenous factors of late&#13;
     (higher average oil price, inflation etc) present&#13;
     a risk to the utility in the short term.&#13;

&#13;
The above operating budget derives from the&#13;
financial model - updated to include SONES's&#13;
2007 results. The model predicts stable growth in&#13;
total revenue (including insignificant ancillary&#13;
incomes), with revenue rising at a compound&#13;
annual growth rate of 5.8% to CFA23bn by F11&#13;
(largely in line with new connections and stable&#13;
tariff increases). Operating expenses, and notably&#13;
staff costs, are expected to increase moderately.&#13;
Accordingly, the EBITDA margin is set to dip in&#13;
F08, before increasing thereafter. In contrast, given&#13;
the ongoing capital formation, depreciation charges&#13;
are expected to rise faster than revenue, resulting&#13;
in compression in the operating margin.&#13;
Nonetheless, debt serviceability is expected to&#13;
remain stable, with an interest cover of around 1.3x&#13;
through to F11.&#13;

Notwithstanding the good operational progress&#13;
made by SONEDE over time, the perceived&#13;
strength of management, and virtual monopolistic&#13;
position it holds, the utility faces various&#13;
challenges going forward, including:&#13;
· The relative level of expenditure on staff costs&#13;
     remains high, impeding the organisations&#13;
     ability to allocate financial resources to other&#13;
     key operating functions. Staff costs should be&#13;
     reduced to the lowest possible level, to&#13;
     improve the financial position and flexibility&#13;
     of the organisation.&#13;
· In addition to this, deteriorating exogenous&#13;
     factors of late (higher average oil price,&#13;
     inflation etc) present a risk to the utility in the&#13;
     short term.&#13;
· Tariffs are structured whereby household&#13;
     consumers are in fact purchasing water below&#13;
     the cost of production, with profitability&#13;
     deriving from large-scale consumers (such as&#13;
     government, farmers and other commercial&#13;
     users) who are charged higher rates. As such,&#13;
     with the rollout of services being largely to&#13;
     households, this is likely to place further&#13;
     downward pressure on margins. Tariffs should&#13;
     be restructured such that households are&#13;
     purchasing water on a cost-reflective basis.&#13;
·    Working capital management remains&#13;
     constrained by the challenges experienced&#13;
     with regards to debtors management, in&#13;
     particular government entities. This directly&#13;
     impacts cash generation. As such, a key&#13;

            African water utilities : regional
            comparative utility creditworthiness assessment report
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The gap between funds available to water
            utilities and the demand for water infrastructure has grown.
            There is therefore a need to facilitate the process of
            mobilizing additional funding for developing the water
            sector and ensuring that these investments result in
            sustainable service delivery. One of the key actions taken
            in this regard has been to conduct credit ratings so as to
            develop a better understanding of the credit worthiness
            water utilities in Africa. The findings from a sample study
            are presented in this regional report. The analysis is based
            on data sourced from seven participating water utilities
            across five African countries: Burkina Faso, Kenya, Senegal,
            Tunisia and Uganda. The bulletin's three main sections
            are: 1) an economic and regulatory overview of water
            utilities; 2) a comparative water utility analysis - this
            compares the relative position of the water utilities
            included in the analysis in terms of their size, efficiency,
            debt and liquidity measures, and detailed credit protection
            measures; and 3) individual water utility ratings and
            reports - a summary of rating reports undertaken by Global
            Credit Ratings (GCR).
