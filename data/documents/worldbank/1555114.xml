APPLICATION OF SHADOW PRICING TO COUNTRY&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WITH AN ILLUSTRATION&#13;
FROM PAKISTAN&#13;
This paper, completed in March 1978, demonstrates the role of&#13;
shadow pricing in country economic analysis. It is argued that: first,&#13;
shadow prices serve as summary measures which help the country economist&#13;
to channel the substance of a variety of otherwise disparate and unlinked&#13;
sector studies into subsequent policy analysis; and second, a number of&#13;
issues commonly discussed in country economic reports are shown to be&#13;
amenable to analysis by. the techniques of shadow pricing more usually&#13;
associated with project evaluation. This latter point is the main topic&#13;
of a variety of examples from Pakistan which involve the analysis of such&#13;
diverse policy issues as the optimal level of foreign borrowing, the net&#13;
social benefit of emigration, the social worth of subsidizing wheat and&#13;
the social value of increasing public sector salaries. In order to analyze&#13;
these issues and make the main point of the paper, it is, of course,&#13;
necessary to estimate certain shadow prices. It is stressed, however, that&#13;
while every attempt has been made to make the estimates as accurate as&#13;
possible, in this respect the contribution remains no more than an initial&#13;
desk study in which the primary purpose was to demonstrate the use of shadow&#13;
prices in country economic work rather than to estimate the shadow prices&#13;
themselves.&#13;

APPLICATION OF SHADOW PRICING TO COUNTRY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WITH AN&#13;
ILLUSTRATION FROM PAKISTAN&#13;
I. Purpose of the Paper&#13;
1.        The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the value of shadow pricing,&#13;
and of the work required for the production of shadow prices, in the context&#13;
of country economic analysis. The example of Pakistan is used and a set of&#13;
shadow prices are derived for that country. 1/ The estimated prices were&#13;
based on an unusual period (the early to mid 1970s) and in Pakistan's case it&#13;
may be unwise to assume too readily that the future will be like the recent&#13;
past. Furthermore, there were serious informational gaps in the data used for&#13;
the study, none of the authors being familiar with Pakistan or its data base.&#13;
Other workers on Pakistan have in certain instances come up with significantly&#13;
different estimates and further work is clearly required before an agreed set&#13;
can be presented for use in project appraisal.&#13;
2.        It follows that the policy recommendations derived from the shadow&#13;
prices presented in this paper should be treated with some reserve. In many&#13;
instances these differ sharply from those based on more traditional country&#13;
economic analysis (e.g., those presented in successive Bank economic reports&#13;
on Pakistan). However, this need not detract from the main aim of the paper&#13;
which, as will be seen, raises important issues that need to be faced. Not&#13;
only does it treat these issues in a new light but in some cases the issues&#13;
themselves would not have been raised without the effort to shadow price.&#13;
1/   The main shadow prices are reported in Table 5 and discussed in the&#13;
Appendices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2&#13;
II. The Common Ground Between Country Reporting and Cost-Benefit Analysis&#13;
3.         There is already much common ground between the areas of concern&#13;
in country economic reporting and those areas which require some investigation&#13;
for shadow-pricing purposes. The latter most notably include:&#13;
(a) tariffs and subsidies on imports and exports; trade controls&#13;
and the resulting premia and price distortions;&#13;
(b) the extent of underemployment of labor; the working of labor&#13;
markets, including internal and external migration; labor force projections&#13;
and employment prospects;&#13;
(c)  the uses of government incomes;&#13;
(d) the uses of private income--taxes, savings, and the pattern&#13;
of consumption at different levels, and in rural and urban areas;&#13;
(e) the cost of, and opportunities for, foreign borrowing, and&#13;
(f). the profitability of investment, both public and private, in&#13;
different sectors.&#13;
In addition, if social pricing is used, as in the present paper, one may add:&#13;
.(g) income distribution, and the Government's stated and revealed&#13;
attitudes to growth and equality. This in turn suggests studying consumer&#13;
subsidies, wages policy, land reform, the direct tax system, and savings&#13;
incentives.&#13;
4.        All these subjects find a place in country economic work, though&#13;
not of course in every case, and in some respects less thoroughly than in&#13;
others. For Pakistan, for example, there were special reports in 1977 involv-&#13;
ing labor markets, public industrial investment, and tariffs and subsidies. 1/&#13;
1/   Our estimates of shadow prices for labor, of the value of public income&#13;
and the discount rate, and of conversion factors draw heavily on these&#13;
sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Similarly, the presence of extensive common ground between country reporting&#13;
and shadow pricing work implies considerable overlap in information require-&#13;
ments, and shadow pricing work may throw light on areas of research which&#13;
should be given priority. In our case, we did not have access to reliable&#13;
evidence on, for instance, the profitability of private investment; the social&#13;
profitability of public infrastructural and agricultural investment; the level&#13;
of private savings; or the elasticity of supply and demand for labor. It is&#13;
quite possible that such information exists and would be available to others&#13;
working in this field.&#13;
5.        The need to estimate shadow prices should help to provide some&#13;
focuis to mainly descriptive studies of sectors and aspects of the economy, by&#13;
providing an analytic purpose for the description. It would suggest the&#13;
expansion of some work, and compression in other areas where the description&#13;
is unlikely to be useful in suggesting answers to any question. As we discuss&#13;
below, the shadow price estimates arising out of sector and other studies are&#13;
a primary input into the cost-benefit analysis of policies as well as invest-&#13;
ments.&#13;
III. Shadow Prices and the Analysis of Particular Policies and Issues&#13;
6.         Studies of particular sectors and markets often imply, or are at&#13;
least relevant to, shadow price estimation. But if this is not brought&#13;
out explicitly, then there is no mechanism by which the study can be linked&#13;
to any analysis of policy issues. For instances, if a study of employment&#13;
and labor markets does not end up with estimates of shadow wages, which&#13;
are essentially quantifications of the real scarcity of different kinds-of&#13;
labor, then it is hard to link the study, not only to the value of parti-&#13;
cular investments, but also to any analysis of such issues as wage polic%,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
public works, the overemployment of workers by pwblic industry, or the value&#13;
of emigration or immigration. Shadow prices provide this linking mechanism;&#13;
they are summary measures of the social costs of using particular resources,&#13;
of paying for them at different rates, and of the benefits of using them in&#13;
particular ways. It does not always follow that the estimation of shadow&#13;
prices will result in more conclusive discussions. Sometimes it will tend&#13;
to show that conventional views are inadequately supported, and that no view&#13;
can be taken. The important point, however, is that all available informa-&#13;
tion from sector and other studies be brought to bear on policy analysis;&#13;
shadow pricing is a convenient means of achieving this end.&#13;
7.        Essentially, the same point may be reached by a slightly different&#13;
line of argument. Most country level work is of a "partial" nature. But,&#13;
in. theory, many of the issues addressed can be properly analyzed, if at all,&#13;
only in a general equilibrium framework.   Quantification then requires the&#13;
solution of an appropriate model, and more and better modelling is thus to&#13;
be urged. on the other hand, some of the issues addressed by shadow pricing&#13;
involve quite disaggregated variables, and of course project analysis itself&#13;
often requires very detailed estimations. Estimable models can seldom include&#13;
many variables, and the level of aggregation must remain.high. They are&#13;
general only in the very partial sense of simultaneous solution of a limited&#13;
set of aggregated endogenous variables.&#13;
8.        The shadow pricing system advocated and used in this paper seeks a&#13;
way between the horns of the eternal dilemma posed by the fear that partial&#13;
analysis may leave out important repercussions, and the frequent impossibility&#13;
of applying formal modelling procedures (and the occasional incredibility of&#13;
the results if they are applied). It constitutes a relatively informal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
attempt to capture general equilibrium effects and embody them in the&#13;
particular "national parameters" (as the main shadow prices, to be esti-&#13;
mated at the country level, are sometimes called). 1/&#13;
9.         Thus, an estimate of the social value of public income is an&#13;
explicit attempt to capture some of the general equilibrium effects of changes&#13;
in public sector expenditure. Similarly, the consumption conversion factor&#13;
(CCF) captures a variety of general equilibrium effects, including multiplier&#13;
effects, arising from private expenditure. The lack of any estimate of these&#13;
numbers in the earlier descriptive analyses covering these areas has conse-&#13;
quently limited the usefulness of such work for the assessment of a variety of&#13;
policy issues. As a result, different pieces of work are not integrated in a&#13;
useful fashion, and policy analysis is not as definitive as it might be with&#13;
shadow pricing. Of course, it may not be definitive with shadow pricing&#13;
either, but, in such cases, the particular areas where additional information&#13;
or more refined estimates are required would be immediately apparent as a&#13;
result of the attempt to shadow price.&#13;
10.       Apart from this, shadow pricing also instills a way of thinking&#13;
about economic issues which may often be helpful. For example, the "gap"&#13;
view of external financing requirements leads to an analysis of foreign&#13;
borrowing in terms of a residual and not in terms of the economic rationality&#13;
of foreign borrowing. Similarly, advice such as "It is desirable to restrict&#13;
the external gap to the amount of assistance that can be raised on concessional&#13;
terms," also abstracts from the economic rationality of foreign borrowing.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Closelv related to this is the view that remittances offer an immediate and&#13;
dir :ct means )f imprvxing the balance of payments, without adequate considera-&#13;
tion being given to the increase in private consumption or savings resulting&#13;
from the remittances (which will cause increased imports and reduced exports)&#13;
or tc the foregone output (and hence loss of foreign exchange) of the emigrat-&#13;
ing labor. Some examples of analyzing particular internal policies through&#13;
shadow pricing are given below, and concern the value of wheat subsidies, of&#13;
pay increases, and of permitting the emigration of artisans. The value of&#13;
foreign borrowing is also analyzed.&#13;
IV. Some Tentative Findings for Pakistan&#13;
11.        Some of the findings in this section may surprise the reader.     Their&#13;
surprising nature flows directly from the very low best estimate for the&#13;
accounting rate of interest (ARI) of 2%. Other shadow prices estimated are&#13;
not surprising in the light of analyses conducted in other counties.&#13;
Accounting Rate of Interest&#13;
12.       The ARI is defined as the rate of fall over time in the welfare&#13;
value of public sector income measured at border prices. It can be calcu-&#13;
lated through the formula&#13;
ARI = CRI d-      1 &#13;
dt   v&#13;
where CRI denotes the consumption rate of interest and v the welfare value of&#13;
public sector income at border prices relative to private consumption. 1/&#13;
1/   The formula is intuitively transparent:    the ARI is by definition the rate&#13;
of fall in the value of public income; the CRI the rate of fall in the&#13;
value of private consumption; therefore, their difference measures the&#13;
rate of fall in the relative value of public income to private consump-&#13;
tion (i.e., -       .v )I The CRI, which measures how much more valuable a&#13;
unit of consumption now is than a unit received a year hence, is discussed&#13;
in Appendix A, paras. 1.5 and 1.6; the discussion of the ARI and v&#13;
occupies us extensively in Appendix A, paras. 1.9 through 1.26.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
The low level of the estimated ARI is the result of a low rate of growth&#13;
of income per head, suggesting a low CRI at 3%, and a slightly increasing&#13;
value of v arising mainly from the very low rate of return to public indus-&#13;
trial investment (around 1%).&#13;
13.       It would have been better if we could have estimated the return&#13;
to public investment from a broader base, since public sector industrial&#13;
investment is only 30% of total public investment. Other public investment,&#13;
e.g., in agriculture or in primary education, may be much more valuable. But&#13;
the economic report on Pakistan also suggests that some infrastructural&#13;
investment may have little value. Be this all as it may, we have taken the&#13;
figure of 2% for the ARI as our best estimate of the discount rate prevailing&#13;
in the recent past.&#13;
14.       The ARI is normally the rate of discount which should be applied to&#13;
investments whose inputs and outputs have been valued at our shadow prices.&#13;
In the present case, however, the estimated ARI is not the rate which we would&#13;
necessarily recommend for use in future project analysis either by the World&#13;
Bank or the Pakistan authorities. The World Bank should not use this rate&#13;
unless it regards its loans as wholly fungible and expects no improvement in&#13;
the social profitability of investment compared to the recent past. As for&#13;
the Pakistan authorities, it would be a correct rate of discount to usc Lnly&#13;
for a public agency which had no influence on government policy in other&#13;
spheres of activity and which knew that the alternative to its own invest,aent&#13;
was another public industrial investment similar to those of the recer last.&#13;
If, however, it is thought that Pakistan is seriously committed to an improved&#13;
program of project formulation and selection, then, as part of that 1roiram,&#13;
it would be appropriate to recoiamend a higher ARI than that prevailing _ii the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
recent past, since the purpose of the ARI is to weed out inferior projects.&#13;
Accordingly, in some of our policy analyses, we experiment with ARIs higher&#13;
than 2%.&#13;
Foreign Borrowing&#13;
15.       With such low returns it may well be thought that Pakistan should&#13;
not be borrowing abroad, or anyway, not borrowing as much. Indeed, the&#13;
"Updating Memorandum" recommends that "hard" borrowing should be verydlimited.&#13;
However, such a hunch can be questioned unless it is given more precise&#13;
analytic support. Inflation implies that "hard" borrowirfg may really be very&#13;
soft. Not only is the interest rate reduced by the rate of inflation, but&#13;
there is a further gain from any waiver period for repayment of the principal.&#13;
16.       The procedure adopted here is to estimate the present cost of the&#13;
loan by discounting future repayments and interest by the ARI and the expected&#13;
rate of inflation of the prices of imports and exports. If, at the margin of&#13;
borrowing, a loan has a grace period of t years, matures after T years, and&#13;
carries an interest rate which implies annual debt servicing in the period&#13;
after the waiver of s%, it is economically rational to expand public sector&#13;
expenditure provided:&#13;
I &gt;     __S---   [1 - (1 + AR' +  )(Tt)    (1 +ARI + p)-t&#13;
"'ARI + p&#13;
where p is the expected rate of inflation for Pakistan's imports and ex-&#13;
ports. 1/ The beauty of the ARI in this context is that it is the appropriate&#13;
rate to discount public income expressed in foreign echange or its equivalent.&#13;
1/   A more detailed exposition is given in Appendix A, paras. 1.35, and 1.37.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
In principle at least, future foreign exchange shortages and the "transfer&#13;
problem" are also fully allowed for. 1/&#13;
17.       We examined loans on two sets of terms.    The first set comprises&#13;
loans of 15 years' maturity with a waiver of 3 years and 8% interest rate,&#13;
and roughly corresponds to World Bank loans. The second set includes loans&#13;
of 10 years' maturity with a waiver of 2 years at 10% interest rate, and&#13;
roughly corresponds to hard commercial borrowing. The results are quite&#13;
sensitive to the exact terms of the waiver. We have assumed that interest&#13;
is compounded to the start of the repayment period, and then paid on equal&#13;
annual installments without further "interest on interest".     The results tend&#13;
to confirm that Pakistan should not be borrowing on "hard" terms.&#13;
18.       More precisely, the "Bank-type" loan will have a positive present&#13;
value provided the inflation rate exceeds 5.3% p.a. for 15 years even if the&#13;
ARI is as low as 2%. It is clear that even if actual Bank loans are fully&#13;
fungible, then, at an expected rate of inflation of over 6%, there is little&#13;
risk that they will not be socially beneficial. On the other hand, the hardel&#13;
type loan would have a negative present value at 5.3% inflation rate unless&#13;
the ARI were as high as 4%. If the rate of inflation was as high as 7.2%&#13;
p.a. for 10 years, then the present value would just be positive with an&#13;
ARI of 2%. Table 1 presents a sensitivity analysis of the value of foreign&#13;
borrowing, and the method is explained in detail in Appendix A.&#13;
1/   No allowance, however, has been made for the possibility that the terms&#13;
of trade might change in response to a change in debt service. We have&#13;
no reason to believe that any possible effect here would be significant.&#13;

a/   The matrix figures are the value of the RHS of the equation on page 8.&#13;
19.       The terms of the "Bank-type" loan examined above are fairly close&#13;
to the average cost of borrowing of all loans at an interest rate of over&#13;
6.0% in the years FY74-FY77 (the average maturity was 14.6 years, average&#13;
waiver 3.1 years, and average interest rate 8.4%). 1/ This suggests that&#13;
there are some loans at harder terms, and that it may be better for Pakistan&#13;
to repay these rather than use foreign currency for other public expenditures&#13;
including investment. However, 85% of Pakistan's borrowing was at interest&#13;
rates below 6%, so that only a very small fraction of the total borrowing&#13;
is likely to be in this class. Thus, Pakistan has probably been quite&#13;
close to optimum borrowing. This conclusion, however, could not have been&#13;
reached as convincingly as it is done here without using an estimate of&#13;
the ARI, and by the same token if the ARI exceeds 2% foreign borrowing&#13;
should be expanded.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Domestic Borrowing&#13;
20.        A rather stranger consequence of a low ARI is that government&#13;
borrowing at home may have a negative social-value. The social value of&#13;
saving one rupee and lending it to the government, assuming no taxation on&#13;
the interest (r) paid, is calculated through the following formula:&#13;
(I -  r )CCF - (1-    rI) di&#13;
ARI             CRI  v&#13;
The first term is the resource gain: the government gains the CCF in the&#13;
present, and loses r. CCF in each future year, which latter has a present&#13;
cost of  R   CCF.  The second term is the social cost of private abstention:&#13;
ARI&#13;
the loss of one rupee's consumption in the present is offset by the present&#13;
value of an annual gain of r in the future, both being weighted by the appro-&#13;
priate distribution weight (d- ). Where r = CRI, as is thought to be the&#13;
case in Pakistan recently, the second term vanishes. The social value of&#13;
private savings lent to the government is then positive or negative depend-&#13;
ing on whether the ARI exceeds r or vice versa. Our best estimate of the&#13;
ARI is 2%, which is less than r (3%).&#13;
21.        It appears that the government may be offering private savers a&#13;
higher real rate of return than it gains through its own expenditure (espe-&#13;
cially if it is assumed that marginal borrowing results wholly in increased&#13;
public investment). This loss is not offset by any social value arising&#13;
from pushing consumption into the future, because the social discount rate&#13;
for future consumption is thought to be about equal to the private real&#13;
rate of return on savings deposits (both about 3%). The best remedy for&#13;
this situation, of course, is not to offer savers less (as in the past),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
but to raise the return on. public investment (see Appendix A, paras. 1.31 -&#13;
1.33). As in the case of foreign borrowing, an analysis of domestic borrowing&#13;
by the public sector is seen to depend on the existence of prior estimates of&#13;
the ARI and the CRI.&#13;
The Relative Value of Investment and Consumption Increases--Equity vs. Growth&#13;
22.       The low rate of return on public investment also makes it interesting&#13;
to compare, at the margin, the social value of such investment with the social&#13;
value of public expenditure for consumption (wheat) subsidies. We have esti-&#13;
mated the social value of a unit of income allocated to investment by discount-&#13;
ing the stream of future returns expressed in terms of consumption by the CRI&#13;
(see Appendix A, para. 1.23). The social value of a unit of public income&#13;
allocated to consumption subsidies was obtained by taking a weighted average of&#13;
the shares of a marginal increase in the subsidy accruing to various income&#13;
classes, the weights being the consumption distribution weights of each income&#13;
class (see Appendix A, paras. 109 - 1.13). This comparison relates directly&#13;
to the concept of a trade-off between equity (consumption subsidies) and growth&#13;
(investment). In this instance, we find that there is little to choose be-&#13;
tween these alternative uses of public income, if concern for equity is&#13;
expressed by taking the social elasticity of the marginal utility of income&#13;
(n) to be equal to 1. If n = 2 (that is, if equity is given a higher weight),&#13;
wheat subsidies are slightly preferred (Table 2)o The relatively favorable&#13;
verdict for wheat subsidies is partly due to the fairly equal distribution&#13;
of income in Pakistan, as seen from Table 3, so that the loss involved in&#13;
subsidizing the well-off is not very great. But mainly, of course, it&#13;
stems from the poor returns to public industrial investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13-&#13;
23.        Although less clearly related to any consideration of equity, we&#13;
also examined the social value of the extra consumption arising from recent&#13;
public sector pay rises relative to that of public sector investment. For&#13;
the lowest paid public sector workers, a unit of public income assigned to&#13;
public pay increases is socially more valuable than a unit assigned to public&#13;
investment even if n = 1 (Table 2).&#13;
Table 2: THE RATIO OF THE VALUE OF PUBLIC CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE TO THE&#13;
VALUE OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT&#13;
n=                     n =2&#13;
Wheat subsidies            0.99                    1.17&#13;
Public pay increases        1.17                   1.58&#13;
24.        As before, these results could easily be reversed if either our&#13;
estimates of public sector profitability are too low, or if profitability&#13;
is expected to increase in the future. An increase in the rate of return&#13;
to public sector investment from 1% to 4% would reverse conclusions, even&#13;
for n = 2 (see Appendix A, Tables 1.7 and 1.10). In this event it would pay&#13;
to shift the balance in favor of growth by increasing investment. On the&#13;
other hand, if our estimate of 1% rate of return is accurate, then public&#13;
investment should be cut back. The moral is that if one cannot grow fast,&#13;
then it does not pay to try!&#13;
25.        We also calculated the critical consumption level (CCL), i.e..,&#13;
that level of consumption where an extra unit of consumption is deemed to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
be exactly as valuable as public income. The CCL may be calculated from&#13;
-      1~~/n-&#13;
the formula:  c (v.CCF)     where c is average per capita consumption and&#13;
CCF is the consumption conversion factor (0.80). The CCL is that point&#13;
at which d/v = CCF, which occurs at the fourth population quintile as seen&#13;
in Table 3. Whether n = 1 or n = 2, the CCL is almost exactly equal to&#13;
average per capita consumption (Rs 1,620 p.a.), which occurs in the fourth&#13;
population quintile. The calculation of this parameter has important impli-&#13;
cations for a number of policies including cost recovery for public seivices,&#13;
tax allowances and consumption subsidies. For instance, the CCL would indicate&#13;
the appropriate level of household income below which the cost recovery charges&#13;
for public services should not, on purely equity grounds, be imposed--the other&#13;
considerations, however, (e.g., efficiency and political and administrative&#13;
feasibility) may outweigh the equity consideration.&#13;

Emigration&#13;
26.        It is assumed in country reports that emigration is a net social&#13;
benefit, and also that it benefits the balance of payments. This latter&#13;
assumption is probably correct, but it clearly need not be so in all cir-&#13;
cumstances, especially, of course, where the emigrants are skilled. For&#13;
this reason and also because of the wide interest in this subject, we have&#13;
attempted a cost benefit analysis of marginal emigration. We take an artisan&#13;
as being the typical recent emigrant to OPEC, and examine the repercussions&#13;
of expanding the flow by one person for one year both in the short-run, when&#13;
the supply is ex-hypothesi fixed, and in the long run in which more artisans&#13;
may be trained. If the methods, as outlined here and in Appendix B, seem&#13;
appropriate they could be used elsewhere. The actual results are not as&#13;
definitive as we would have liked, for the usual reason or inadequate infor-&#13;
mation.&#13;
Short-Run Analysis of Migration&#13;
27.        The social benefit (B) or shadow wage rate (SWR ) or a migrant&#13;
is taken to be the remittances generated, plus the net social benefits of&#13;
the changes caused in consumption and savings in the domestic economy. The&#13;
social cost (C) of a migrant is equated with the fall in domestic output,&#13;
plus or minus the social value of any resultant change in the wage rate.&#13;
28.        In the present case it is assumed that there are no barriers to&#13;
emigration so that, at the margin, there should be no change in the welfare&#13;
of the marginal migrant or his family. The social benefit thus defined is&#13;
estimated in Appendix B, paras. 2.25-2.27. Remittances are straightforward,&#13;
but the changes caused in domestic savings and consumption are almost entirely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
a matter of guesswork. Remittances per emigrant are higher than the wage&#13;
the artisan would have earned in Pakistan. There is no information on how&#13;
much of remittances is saved, nor in what form. If one could assume that&#13;
the private savings and consumption of artisans were equally valuable, or&#13;
if there were no savings, then the simple formula&#13;
B = SWR = R - (R-W) CCF&#13;
would apply, where R is remittances, (R-W) is the change (rise) in consump-&#13;
tion plus savings resulting from migration, and CCF is the consumption con-&#13;
version factor.&#13;
29.        We do not, however, think that either of the assumptions validating&#13;
such a formula is safe to make. Assuming there are savings, their social&#13;
value then depends on the use to which they are put--if they go into savings&#13;
deposits, then, as already suggested above, the social value may be less than&#13;
if the same amount had been consumed, while if they are otherwise invested&#13;
the reverse is probably the case.    The upshot is that SWR /W is very uncertain,&#13;
and we produce estimates ranging from 0.75 to 1.12.     Regarding the upper end&#13;
of the range as more likely, we make a best guess that SWR     = W.&#13;
30.        We then turn to the social costs (C) of migration.    The following&#13;
formula is used:&#13;
C = W.SCF + W W*&#13;
nd&#13;
where nd is the elasticity of the domestic demand for labor, and W* is&#13;
the social cost per rupee of the transfer of income implied by a change&#13;
in the wage rate. The first term is the border-price value of the foregone&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
output, assuming that the artisan's marginal product is equal to his wage.&#13;
The second term is the social cost of the income transfer resulting from&#13;
the change in the wage rate.&#13;
31.        The balance of payments effect can be investigated by setting&#13;
W* = 0, which yields the simple expression:&#13;
SWR&#13;
B - C = W( W m    - SCF)&#13;
SWR&#13;
Our best estimate of     m  exceeds that of the SCF (.85), so that B-C is&#13;
positive. In other words, this suggests a small positive balance of pay-&#13;
ments benefit from marginal emigration. But it is far less than remittances,&#13;
being surely no more than a small fraction of the wage, whereas remittances&#13;
are larger than the wage.&#13;
32.        However, total benefit should not be equated with balance of pay-&#13;
ments benefit. We, therefore, present below two sensitivity analyses of&#13;
the B/C ratio of emigration and nd and SWR , the two variables which are&#13;
most uncertain. The first is for the balance of payments effect, and the&#13;
second for all benefits. The second uses our best estimate for W* (.35),&#13;
corresponding to n = 2, and shows the effect of introducing distributional&#13;
considerations. Both use SCF = .85.&#13;

33.        The upshot is that there is probably a small positive balance of&#13;
payments gain from emigration, but that if income distribution is allowed for&#13;
there is quite a heavy net social cost to emigration. The elasticity of&#13;
SWR&#13;
demand for labor has to be quite high (2.33 if       m = 1.0) to stop costs&#13;
w&#13;
outweighing benefits. However, in the longer run the very sharp rises in&#13;
artisan wages which have occurred in recent years, and which have worsened&#13;
the distribution of income as artisans earn far more than average incomes,&#13;
could be reversed as the supply increases.&#13;
Emigration--Long Run Analysis&#13;
34.        This is simpler because we assume that there is no change in the&#13;
domestic wage of unskilled workers and that training is expanded so as to&#13;
leave the domestic supply of skilled labor unchanged. The cost of a migrant&#13;
becomes:&#13;
C =  SWR  + a W(CCF - d) + T&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
where SWR is the shadow wage rate of an unskilled worker, t&amp;W is the increase&#13;
in wage income resulting from training, CCF is the consumption conversion&#13;
factor, - is the social value of the increased earnings, T is the public&#13;
V&#13;
expenditure on training evaluated at border prices. The benefit of a migrant&#13;
remains as before.&#13;
35.        Figures are estimated, and a sensitivity analysis is conducted in&#13;
Appendix B. For a very wide range of assumptions it can be concluded that&#13;
training is a good investment, either specifically for migration, or to&#13;
increase the supply of artisans assuming that a proportion of them migrate&#13;
as determined by the demand elasticities. However, both results depend on the&#13;
foreign demand for Pakistan labor being sustained. If demand tapers off,&#13;
an expansion in training programs could result in falling domestic wages&#13;
for artisans, and this has not been allowed for. As with any export activity,&#13;
a careful assessment of foreign demand is essential in analysing the emigra-&#13;
tion issue.&#13;

V. Conclusions&#13;
36.        The issues addressed above are frequently the subject of discussion&#13;
in country economic reporting. In contrast to their usual treatment in&#13;
country economic reports, however, our approach has emphasized the role of&#13;
shadow prices in addressing them and in arriving at policy conclusions. In&#13;
particular, we have suggested that an adequate treatment of the issue of&#13;
Government borrowing requires an estimate of the ARI. Similarly, our analysis&#13;
of emigration was based on prior estimates of the CCF, distribution weights&#13;
and shadow wage rates. While the list of issues addressed here is clearly&#13;
not exhaustive, we have, nevertheless, made use of virtually all the shadow&#13;
prices which are usually required for project analysis. The main shadow&#13;
prices estimated in this exercise are reported in Table 5. As noted in the&#13;
Introduction, our estimates are based on incomplete data supplemented by&#13;
guesswork on the part of those who are unfamiliar with the Pakistani economy.&#13;
The estimates should, therefore, be used with caution, and, as additional&#13;
data become available, be reestimated and refined.&#13;
37.        The primary point that we endeavored to put forth in this paper&#13;
was that the estimation of shadow prices should not be regarded as merely&#13;
an addition to country-level work. The work involved in estimation itself&#13;
gives insights into the operation of the economy, and to a large extent&#13;
overlaps with normal country-level work. Moreover, the need to come up&#13;
with shadow prices can provide a focus for country work, and may even&#13;
help to cut down some descriptions which have no analytic purpose.&#13;
38.        The shadow prices also provide analytic linkages.    By summarizing&#13;
the work on a particular sector through the calculation of a relevant&#13;
parameter (e.g., the social value of public industrial investment relative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22 -&#13;
to private consumption), they allow its results to be fed into the analysis&#13;
of variqus issues, and not merely into investment decisions. Thus, they&#13;
either make such analyses more definitive, or at least point to what is needed&#13;
in order to come-up with an answer.&#13;
39.       To sum up, it seems to us that tne incorporation'of shadow prices&#13;
into country reports should make their-compilation more interesting, would&#13;
help to call attention to important issues, and would bring the economic&#13;
rationale of different policies into the limelight.&#13;

DISCOUNT RATES, THE VALUE OF PUBLIC INCOME, CONSUMPTION&#13;
DISTRIBUTION WEIGHTS, PRIVATE SAVINGS, AND FOREIGN BORROWING&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.1       In this appendix we describe the methods and data sources under-&#13;
lying our estimates of discount rates (the consumption and accounting rates of&#13;
interest), the value of pulic income and the consumption distribution weights.&#13;
First we present an assessment of the Government's social objectives, from&#13;
which we deduce the likely range of values for the consumption rate of interest.&#13;
We then describe recent trends in public income and expenditures (paras. 1.5&#13;
and 1.6), and present estimates of the value of public income based on its&#13;
three different uses: wheat subsidies (paras. 1.0 to 1.13), public sector&#13;
wage increases (paras. 1.14 to 1.16) and public sector industrial investment&#13;
(paras. 1.17 to 1.27). Based on the preceding analysis, we then make an&#13;
estimate of the accounting rate of interest (paras. 1.28 to 1.29). We finallv&#13;
estimate the values of domestic sa-ings and government borrowing (paras.&#13;
1.30-1.41). Our main results are presented in tabular form at the end of the&#13;
appendix.&#13;
Government Objectives 1/&#13;
1.2        After the secession of Bangladesh-and the consequent abandonment&#13;
of the Fourth Five Year Plan (FY 1970-75), Pakistan has produced a series&#13;
of Annual Development Plans which focus primarily on the Government's develop-&#13;
ment budget. A draft Fifth Plan is under preparation but has already undergone&#13;

three. revisions in the light of changing. circum'stances.  Despite the revi-&#13;
sions, the Government's` overall objectives have remained constant and will&#13;
probably appear intact. iL. the next version of the. Fifth Plan (FY 1978-83).&#13;
1.3       The! Plant's' statedi objectives are' t.he! reduction of poverty,, an&#13;
increase in' epio.ymen't, and the attainment of regional integration, self-&#13;
sufficiency in food, and a low rate of population growth,. The macro-economic&#13;
targets. are:&#13;
(i)' An, output growth rate of 8% per year based' on a 12Z growth&#13;
o'f large scalie manufacturing and' a 5.5% growth in agricul-&#13;
ture.&#13;
(ii)  A\ rate of investment of 19' of GDP.&#13;
(iii)' .X growth. r.ate of 6.5%' in real private consumption, implying&#13;
a per capita growth rate of over 3:X.&#13;
(iv)  A. decline in foreign financing from. 49% to 20% of total&#13;
investmentt.&#13;
(.v) A marginal savings rate of' 27%t implying an average savings&#13;
rate of' 16' of GNP by FY 1983.&#13;
(vi) An, average growth rate in merchandise exports of 10% per year.&#13;
(vii) A rapid expansion of the 'social sectors,. especially rural&#13;
health and primary education facilities.&#13;
(viii) A population growth rate of 2.4% by 1983.&#13;
1.4       Wi-th; respect to output growth and the rate of' investment, the plan&#13;
can very quickly be put into perspective by a comparison' wi-th past achieve-&#13;
ments.  For example, between FY 1971. and FY 1976 manufacturing output grew&#13;
at an annual. rate of only 2..1%' while agriculture' grew at about 2.3%.  The&#13;
average growth of GDP since FY 1971 has been about 4%. Over the same period&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- .25 -&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
Page 3&#13;
the population growth rate is estimated to be 3.0%,implying that GDP per&#13;
capita has grown at about 1%. The growth of per capita consumption, however,&#13;
has been somewhat greater: in real terms private consumption has increased&#13;
at an annual rate of about 5% implying a per capita growth rate of 2%. The&#13;
Plan objectives thus reveal a strong desire to increase the growth rate of the&#13;
economy. Investment has ranged from 14.3% of GNP in FY 1970 to 12.2% in&#13;
FY 1974 and 17.1% in FY 1976; savings, however, have ranged from 12.7% in&#13;
FY 1970 to 6.9% in FY 1974 and 9.8% in FY 1976. Again, compared to recent&#13;
achievements, the Plan targets reveal a desire to increase investment and&#13;
savings. Tlus, whether one looks at planned growth rates or planned levels&#13;
of investment and savings, the government objectives would seem to indicate&#13;
a very low consumption rate of interest, since the lower this rate the less&#13;
one discounts future relative to current consumption, and hence the greater&#13;
the premium one assigns to resources which promote growth.&#13;
Trends in Public Income and Expenditure&#13;
1.5       Table A-1 shows the trends in the sources of public income and its&#13;
allocation to different expenditure categories for the period FY72 to FY76.&#13;
As a percentage of total (current and capital) expenditure, public revenue&#13;
has fallen from 72% in FY72 to 54% in FY76 whereas external financing has&#13;
increased from 8% to 26% over the same period. This implies that at the&#13;
margin foreign borrowing has recently been the most important means of&#13;
financing the expansion of public sector expenditure. On the expenditure&#13;
side, development expenditure 'current and capital account) has increased&#13;
from 22% of total expenditure ;n FY72 to 38% in FY76.&#13;

1.6       Table A-2 contains a more detailed breakdown of public expenditure.&#13;
With regard to nondevelopment expenditure, defense, internal security and&#13;
interest payments have fallen from about 67% in FY72 and FY73 to around 56% in&#13;
FY77 and FY78. If these three items are considered noneconomic (defense and&#13;
internal security) or fixed (interest payments) expenditure, then it is&#13;
appropriate to focus attention on the remaining items. Of the remainder, the&#13;
percentage allocated to wheat subsidies has varied dramatically: it accounted&#13;
for 5% of the remainder in FY72; 33% in FY74; and in FY78 it is expected to&#13;
account for 6%. The big increase in FY74 (and surrounding years) mirrors the&#13;
large increases in the world price of wheat occuring at that time, and repre-&#13;
sents an attempt by the government to insulate private consumers from the&#13;
effect of a rising import price. The Government has also attempted to offset&#13;
the effects of inflation on consumers by allocating-Rs. 1,770m. in the FY78&#13;
budget to wage increases for all government employees including those in the&#13;
armed forces. If the wage increase to the armed forces is netted out of the&#13;
total wage increase, the remaining wage increase (Rs. 1,300) is 13% of discre-&#13;
tionary nondevelopment expenditure (i.e., total development expenditure less&#13;
that assigned to defense, internal security, and interest payments). These&#13;
two policies, wheat subsidies and public sector wage increases, are analyzed&#13;
in more detail below. With regard to capital expenditure, the annual develop-&#13;
ment plan reveals that public expenditure in the industrial sector has in-&#13;
creased from 9% of total development spending in FY72 and FY73 to 33% in FY77&#13;
and a planned 27% in FY78. The very rapid increase reflects the Government's&#13;
nationalization policy especially with respect to large scale manufacturing.&#13;
The use of public sector income for this purpose is also analyzed below.&#13;

Consumption Rate of Interest&#13;
1.7       The consumption rate of interest (CRI) is the sum of pure time&#13;
preference and the product of the growth rate of real per capita consumption&#13;
and the social elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption. Of the&#13;
three elements of the CRI, only the growth rate of real per capita consumption&#13;
can be estimated objectively. For the period FY72 to FY77, total private&#13;
consumption at constant prices grew at an annual rate of 4.5% 1/,implying an&#13;
average growth rate of real per capita consumption of 1.5%.&#13;
1.8       With regard to the subjective parameters, Pakistan's draft Fifth&#13;
Plan makes it quite clear that growth is the primary objective of the next few&#13;
years, although equity is not neglected. This suggests a zero or very low&#13;
value for the rate of pure time preference (0 - 1%), because an increase in&#13;
this parameter reduces, other things being equal, the extent to which the&#13;
weighting system favors growth. It also suggests a positive, but not large,&#13;
value for the social elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption (n).&#13;
It must be positive in order to reflect some degree of concern for distribu-&#13;
tion. But it should not be taken to be very large. The higher its value the&#13;
higher is the consumption rate of interest (CRI), and the latter partly&#13;
determines the appropriate discount rate for investment (ARI) which directly&#13;
influences growth. 2/ As our best estimates, we set the rate of pure time&#13;
1/   Private sector consumption at constant 1970 prices is estimated by the&#13;
Country Programs Division to be Rs. 38,284m. in FY72 and Rs. 47,995m.&#13;
in FY77.&#13;
2/   Accounting Rate of Interest (ARI) = CRI plus the rate of fall of the&#13;
value of public income relative to consumption.&#13;

preference equal to 0 and choose a value of 2 for the social elasticity. But&#13;
throughout we also experiment with n - 1. Table A-1 presents the range of&#13;
values for the CRI implied by the above.    Within the resulting range&#13;
(1.5X &#143;t CRI    - 4.0%), our best estimate for the CRI is 3.0%.&#13;

The Social Value of Wheat Subsidies&#13;
1.9       Subsidizing wheat (an important staple) represents an effort by&#13;
the Government to protect consumers from rising import prices. In choosing&#13;
the extent of the subsidy, the Government has made an explicit judgement&#13;
concerning the value of public income relative to the value of private consump-&#13;
tion. It is possible, therefore, to estimate the value of public income&#13;
relative to average private consumption implied by this policy by means of a&#13;
comparison of the costs and benefits of the transfer. The benefit of the&#13;
transfer (that is, the increase in welfare enjoyed by wheat consumers) is&#13;
measured by the quantity consumed times the subsidy per unit of consumption&#13;
times the relevant distribution weight (d - which relates the particular level&#13;
of consumption to the average). The cost of the transfer (that is, the&#13;
reduction in public income in terms of foreign exchange equivalents) is given&#13;
by the subsidy times the consumption conversion factor. The relative value of&#13;
public income is then given by the ratio of benefits to costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

1.10      The calculation of benefits is set out in Table A-4.    In columns&#13;
1 and 2 we present the percentage of urban households by income class. The&#13;
analysis is confined to urban consumers since rural households are believed&#13;
to rely mainly on own-consumption. To the extent that rural households buy&#13;
and consume subsidized wheat and to the extent that rural households are&#13;
poorer than urban households, the estimate presented here will understate&#13;
the true value of the subsidy. Dividing total household consumption expendi-&#13;
ture (column 3) by household size yields the per capita consumption levels&#13;
reported in column 5, which are used to arrive at the weights (d) shown in&#13;
columns 6 and 7 by means of the formula, d. = (c / ci) , where c is average&#13;
per capita consumption, and n is the social elasticity of the marginal utility&#13;
of consumption, and c   is the i   consumption level.   Finally, the value of&#13;
the subsidy (columns 8 and 9) was obtained by multiplying the proportion of&#13;
wheat consumption (shown in parentheses in column 4) by the appropriate weight&#13;
for each consumption class and summing over all percentiles. The resulting&#13;
value of the transfer is 0.88 for n = 1 and 0.84 for n = 2.&#13;
1.11      The cost of the transfer per unit of subsidy is equated with the&#13;
consumption conversion factor (CCF) which is estimated to be 0.80 for urban&#13;
consumers (see Appendix C). 1/ We, therefore, arrive at an implied value&#13;
of public income of 1.10 (0.88 4 0.80) for n = 1 and 1.05 (0.84 4 0.80)&#13;
for n = 2. On the basis of this analysis, we conclude that the value of public&#13;
income implied by the wheat subsidy is 1.10 for n = 1 and 1.05 for n = 2.&#13;
I/   In principle a different factor is required for each population percen-&#13;
tile. This refinement is ignored here.&#13;

1.12      In evaluating this result several possible limitations should&#13;
be kept in mind. First, the subsidy may have been introduced for some reason&#13;
other than the transfer of income to wheat consumers. However, a recent&#13;
assessment of the wheat subsidy describes it as an effort "to insure low&#13;
income consumers--especially those in major urban areas--access to nominally&#13;
priced grain products especially atta (a whole wheat flour)." 1/ Secondly,&#13;
the effect of the wheat subsidy may have differed from the Government' inten-&#13;
tions. Money wages, for example, may have been reduced (or may not have&#13;
increased as quickly) as a result of the subsidy. In the short run, however,&#13;
it is probably safe to conclude that the benefits accrued to wheat consumers&#13;
especially if the analysis is confined to FY74 to FY76 when subsidies were&#13;
substantial in response to the rising import price. (see paragraph 3.10).&#13;
Thirdly, some of the benefit to wheat consumers may have resulted in additional&#13;
saving rather than additional consumption. According to the Household Income&#13;
and Expenditure Survey FY72, however, on average urban households saved only&#13;
1% of their income. It is unlikely, therefore, that any major error has been&#13;
introduced on this score. Fourthly, since the subsidy scheme works by means&#13;
of ration shops, it may be more appropriate to calculate the value of the&#13;
subsidy on the assumption that subsidized wheat consumption per person is&#13;
the same for everybody and is determined by the Government rationing policy.&#13;
This assumption, however, does not significantly change the value of the&#13;
subsidy as calculted above, indicating a very low income elasticity of&#13;
wheat consumption.&#13;

1-13      Finally, it is possible that high income consumers do not patronize&#13;
the ration shops and instead purchase higher quality flour on the free market.&#13;
This appears to be the most important objection to our procedure.    We, there-&#13;
fore, recalculated the benefit of the transfer on the assumption that the top&#13;
10% of the population do not consume subsidized wheat. Proceeding in the same&#13;
fashion as before, we arrive at measures of the benefit of 0.96 if n = 1 and&#13;
0.95 if n = 2. Dividing by the CCF(=0.80), the value of public income rela-&#13;
tive to private consumption as implied by the wheat subsidy policy is 1.20 for&#13;
n = 1 and 1.19 for n = 2. These values are taken as our best estimates.&#13;
The. Social Value of Public Sector Wage Increases&#13;
1.14      The Government's decision to increase public sector wages presents&#13;
another opportunity to examine the Government's own perception of the value of&#13;
public income relative to the value of private consumption. In this case,&#13;
however, the Government has been able to influence the distribution of&#13;
increases by allowing different wage and salary increases at different levels.&#13;
The ratio of the emoluments at the lowest grade to those at the highest grade&#13;
has been reduced from 1:26 in 1972 to 1:13 as a result of the current change&#13;
in salaries. Unlike the analysis of the wheat subsidy, it would seem appro-&#13;
priate for this analysis to equate the cost and benefit of supplying a marginal&#13;
unit of consumption to the lowest-paid government employee. This appears to&#13;
be in line with the Government's stated objective to give maximum relief to&#13;
civil servants, particularly the low paid ones. 1/&#13;

1.15      The minimum emolument of the lowest paid worker will be increased&#13;
as a result of the present legislation to Rs. 385 per month. Assuming that&#13;
there are 1.27 wage earners per family and a family size of 4.12 members, a&#13;
monthly income of Rs. 385 per month implies a per capita consumption level of&#13;
Rs. 119 on the assumption that savings are zero. 1/ Average per capita&#13;
consumption in FY77 is estimated to be Rs. 135 per month 2/ so that at the&#13;
margin the value of the wage increase is 1.13 if n = 1 and 1.29 if n = 2.&#13;
Since the cost to the government is given by the consumption conversion factor&#13;
(0.80), the value of public income in terms of consumption as implied by this&#13;
policy is 1.41 (1.13 - 0.80) if n = 1 and 1.61 (1.29 t 0.80) if n = 2.&#13;
1.16      The two components of public current expenditure which we have&#13;
analyzed yield values of public income in the range 1.2 to 1.41 for n = 1&#13;
and 1.19 to 1.61 for n = 2. It has not been possible to assess the value of&#13;
other types of current public expenditure, 3/ but, if we are prepared to&#13;
accept that their value lies somewhere in the ranges established above, it&#13;
is probably most appropriate to take a simple average of the extreme estimates&#13;
1/   For urban households in the bottom four population quintiles there are&#13;
1.27 income earners and 4.12 members. See, "Household Income and Expendi-&#13;
ture Survey FY72," Ministry of Finance, Planning and Development,&#13;
Pakistan, 1973.&#13;
2/   Since the pay rise is effective from May 1, 1977 we use FY77 figures to&#13;
calculate per capita consumption. Private consumption in FY77 is esti-&#13;
mated by the Country Desk to be Rs. 118,548m. FY75 population is esti-&#13;
mated to be 69.229m. which, assuming a 3% growth rate, implies a FY77&#13;
population of 73,445m. Thus, per capita consumption in FY77 is Rs.&#13;
134.51 per month.&#13;

as our best estimate. We thus arrive at a best estimate of that part of&#13;
public income which is allocated to current expenditure of 1.3 for n = 1 and&#13;
1.4 for n = 2.&#13;
The Social Value of Public Sector Industrial Investment&#13;
1.17      To derive the social value of public capital expenditure we calculate&#13;
the average return to public industrial investment. This implies that the&#13;
average new investment will be not better nor worse than in the recent past.&#13;
Of course, any improvement--and there is undoubtedly room for improvement--&#13;
would make an important difference. But we choose not to make any arbitrarily&#13;
optimistic assumption. This procedure also assumes that social returns on&#13;
public sector investment as a whole can be equated to returns on industrial&#13;
investment. It might be argued that our resultant estimate is biased down-&#13;
wards, but we have no information to back up such a hunch,&#13;
1.18      Average profit after interest but before tax for the public indus-&#13;
trial sector was Rs. 160m in FY74, Rs. 262m in FY75 and Rs. 218m in FY76, 1/&#13;
Our calculation of profitability is for FY75. Since, however, FY75 appears&#13;
to be an exceptional year, we take a simple average of real profits for the&#13;
three years shown above, Using the wholesale price index to convert current&#13;
price values to FY75 prices, we obtain an adjusted level of real profits of&#13;
Rs. 213m. for FY75. Interest payments in FY75 amounted to Rs. 347m, so that&#13;
the return to capital in FY75 at market prices is Rs. 560m. To obtain the&#13;

return to capital in FY75 at market prices is Rs. 560m. To obtain the&#13;
return at accounting prices we multiply by a CF of 0.80, 1/ which yields&#13;
a figure of Rs. 449m. as the return to capital at accounting prices.&#13;
1.19      As usual, information on capital stock is much more uncertain.&#13;
The procedure adopted here is to use an estimate of the FY75 book-value&#13;
of fixed assets and information on depreciation rates, inflation rates,&#13;
and conversion factors, to arrive at an estimate of the replacement cost&#13;
of the capital stock. The detailed calculations are presented in Tables&#13;
A-5 and A-6. Table A-5 shows the manner in which the reported book-value&#13;
of assets in FY75 was transformed into a series of annual investment flows.&#13;
Three pieces of information were used. First, during the period FY64-74&#13;
total industrial investment remained roughly constant at current prices. 2/&#13;
We have, therefore, assumed that the investment which went into the creation&#13;
of the capital stock which is now in the public sector also remained con-&#13;
stant at current prices. Second, after nationalization public sector&#13;
industrial investment increased rapidly, reached Rs. 390m. in FY74 and&#13;
Rs. 1065m. in FY75. 3/ We have removed these investments from the end-of-&#13;
year FY75 value of public sector industrial assets (Rs. 4,714m.) on the&#13;
grounds that such recent investment is not yet contributing to output. As&#13;
a result, the relevant year-end value of assets is taken to be Rs. 3,258m,&#13;
1/   The SCF is estimated in Appendix C to be 0.85.     We use a figure of&#13;
.80 here because some public industries enjoy high rates of protec-&#13;
tion. If sufficient information were available, a more specific&#13;
CF could be calculated by estimating CF's for individual public&#13;
sector industries and using the proportion of each industry's profit&#13;
in total profits as weights.&#13;

Thirdly, the tax holidays and depreciation allowances combined to produce&#13;
a zero effective depreciation rate during the first four years of the asset's&#13;
lifet, 15% for the next 5 years and 8% thereafter. 1/    It follows that, given&#13;
ani FY75 value of assets of Rs. 3,258m. annual investment at current market&#13;
prices must have been Rs. 399.26m. per year. 2/&#13;
1.20      Annual investment was then expressed at border prices by using a&#13;
conversion factor of 0.66 for the pre-devaluation (pre-FY73) figures and&#13;
0.78 thereafter (see Appendix C). The factor of 0.66 was based on data&#13;
for the 60s as shown in Table 1.6. During this period the official exchange&#13;
rate was Rs. 4.76 per US dollar so that for those projects importing directly&#13;
under industrial licenses the relevant conversion factor is .0.71 (4.76 ' 6.66).&#13;
For those buying domestically, however, the relevant conversion factor must&#13;
allow for quantitative restrictions and hence the relevant factor is 0.51&#13;
(4.76 a 9.33). Weighting by the proportion of capital goods imported under&#13;
commerical license and, therefore, available for resale, we arrive at an&#13;
average conversion factor of 0.66. Finally, the investment flows were&#13;

2/   We have arbitrarily assumed a cut-off period for this analysis of 15&#13;
years. That is, capital's value is zero after 15 years. The figure&#13;
of Rs. 399.26m. for annual investment is reasonably consistent with&#13;
the figure of annual private investment in large-scale manufacturing&#13;
of Rs. 1,100m. during FY64-FY72 and the assessment that the FY72&#13;
nationalization involved approximately one-third of Pakistan's manu-&#13;
facturing assets.&#13;

also reported the percentage of capital goods imported under commercial&#13;
license for resale in Pakistan. The official exchange rate during this&#13;
period was Rs. 4.76 per collar.&#13;
Source: S. R. Lewis, Pakistan: Industrialization and Trade Policies,&#13;
Oxford University Press, 1970, Tables 4.6 and 4.7.&#13;
arrive at an average conversion factor of 0.66. Finally, the investment&#13;
flows were expressed at FY75 prices and summed (see footnote to Table A-5).&#13;
The resulting value of the capital stock is thus estimated to be Rs. 7500&#13;
and the annual profit of public sector investment to be 6% for a period&#13;
of 15 years.&#13;
1.21      There are several obvious weaknesses in this estimation procedure.&#13;
First, to the extent that tariffs are waived on imported capital goods, the&#13;
conversion factors used in calculating the border value of capital will be&#13;
too low. Secondly, to the extent that importers of capital goods practice&#13;
over-invoicing, the conversion factors will be too high. (Point one tends&#13;
to reduce the return to capital by increasing the value of the capital&#13;
stock, whereas point two works in the opposite direction.)     Thirdly, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
Page 19&#13;
conversion factor applied to profits may be too high, since some of the&#13;
public sector industries enjoy high rates of nominal protection. Fourthly,&#13;
since the capital stock figure as estimated is undepreciated, it is appropriate&#13;
to relate it to gross profit. On balance, the shift to gross profit may be&#13;
the most needed adjustment. This would probably raise the estimate to about&#13;
7%. But the uncertainty of the procedures lead us to experi Lent with the&#13;
range 5-9% in Table A-7.&#13;
1.22      A final objection is that the life of capital assumed (15 years)&#13;
may be too short. On the assumption of a 20-year life, which increases&#13;
the estimate of the value of the capital stock, the figure of 6% would be&#13;
reduced to 4.8%. Adding 1% in accordance with the argument of the previous&#13;
paragraph, we arrive at a best estimate of 5.8%, but again experiment with the&#13;
range 3.8% to 7.8% in Table A-7.&#13;
1.23      To determine the value of public sector investment in terms of&#13;
consumption, we need to identify the uses made of the return to public sector&#13;
investment. We note first that any leakage to the private sector through&#13;
increased wage payments is likely to be small since the large-scale manufactur-&#13;
ing sector is highly capital intensive. We, therefore, assume that the entire&#13;
return accrues to the public sector. During the period FY72-78 the marginal&#13;
propensity to reinvest public sector income (through the Annual Development&#13;
Plan) is estimated to be 0.52. 1/ Each unit of public income generated by&#13;
public sector investment is assumed, therefore, to be allocated in the propor-&#13;
tions 0.52 to reinvestment and 0.48 to current expenditure. The value of&#13;
public investment (vinv) may now be expressed as:&#13;
1/   Estimated by regressing expenditure allocated to the Annual Development&#13;
Plan on the sum of this expenditure and non-development revenue expendi-&#13;
ture for the Deriod FY72-78.&#13;

Appendix A&#13;
Page 21&#13;
1.24      Table A-7 reveals that the value of public industrial investment&#13;
is most sensitive to the annual percentage profit earned in the public&#13;
sector.  For our best estimate of the profit rate (q = 7% for T = 15 and&#13;
q = 5.8% for T = 20), vi     varies between 1.13 and 1.29 for n = 1 and 0.99&#13;
and 1.05 for n = 2. Taking a simple average, we arrive at best estimates&#13;
of v.   of 1.21 for n = 1 and 1.02 for n = 2.&#13;
inv&#13;
1.25      The results are summarized in Table A-8, which assumes for lack&#13;
of other evidence that wheat subsidies and public pay rises can be taken as&#13;
typical of current expenditure, and that industrial investment has the same&#13;
social yield as other public capital expenditures.&#13;

Industrial investment                            1.21            1.02&#13;
It can be seen that for n = 1, the estimated value of industrial investment,&#13;
at the margin, is less than that of the pay increases but more than the wheat&#13;
subsidies. For n = 2, even the wheat subsidies are more valuable than indus-&#13;
trial investment. The rather greater consistency for n = 1 could be taken as&#13;
a very weak argument for favoring n = 1. It must, however, be remembered that&#13;
our estimates of the value of industrial investment are very weak. If, for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
Page 22&#13;
instance q = 7.8% and T = 20, then the value of industrial investment com-&#13;
fortably exceeds the value of both the types of current expenditure examined.&#13;
Further analysis of the value of public investment is of high priority for&#13;
research.&#13;
1.26      We are now in a position to arrive at a poor overall estimate of the&#13;
value of public income (v) relative to average additional consumption by first&#13;
averaging the results for wheat subsidies and pay rises, and then taking a&#13;
weighted average of the resultant values of public current expenditure and&#13;
public investment expenditure, where the weights are the proportions of each&#13;
at the margin of public expenditure. Setting the weights equal to 0.48 for&#13;
curre.i. - .,iditure and 0.52 for investment, we obtain best estimates of&#13;
the value of public income of 1.25 for n = 1 and 1.20 for n = 2. Thus,&#13;
whether n = 1 or n = 2, the resulting value of public income is not very&#13;
different because the value of capital expenditure (vi    ) falls as n  in-&#13;
creases, and the value of current expenditure (v ) increases with n, and&#13;
v is a weighted average of viny and v . Using our best estimate of v, we&#13;
present in Table A-9 the resulting consumption distribution weights by&#13;
population quintile. The table reveals the increased concern with equity&#13;
implied by the higher value of n, but in general shows that the distribu-&#13;
tion weights do not vary greatly over income classes; this is a consequence&#13;
of the relatively egalitarian distribution of personal income in Pakistan.&#13;

1.27      We can also use are results to calculate the critical consumption&#13;
level (CCL); that is, that point on the income distribution scale at which&#13;
private consumption is considered as socially valuable as public income.&#13;
For n = I and n = 2 the CCL is almost exactly equal to average per capita&#13;
consumption. 1/ Thus, consumption by those above the national average of&#13;
Rsl620 pa. is considered socially less valuable than public income. This&#13;
1/   The CCL may be calculated from the formula:&#13;
1 /n&#13;
c(v.CCF)&#13;
where c is average per capita consumption and CCF is the consumption&#13;
conversion factor (0.80). The CCL is that point at which d/v = CCF&#13;
which, from Table A-9, is seen to occur in the fourth population quin-&#13;
tile.&#13;

figure must be rather lower than the per capita consumption of the family&#13;
of the average person earning RsI2,000, the point at which direct income&#13;
tax. starts. But this is not an inconsistency. It can be regarded as normal&#13;
for the implied tax exemption point to be higher than the CCL, if only because&#13;
considerations of incentives are relevant to the former but not the latter.&#13;
Accounting Rate of Interest&#13;
1.28      The accounting rate of interest is defined as the rate of fall&#13;
over time in the social value of public sector income measured at border&#13;
prices. Since v is the relative value of public income in terms of con-&#13;
sumption it follows that:&#13;
ARI = CRI - dv       I&#13;
dt      v&#13;
We, therefore, need to examine the rate of fall of v. If it is assumed that&#13;
the marginal allocation of public income between current expenditure and&#13;
investment remains constant, the only components of v which will change over&#13;
time are v   and v in    With respect to vc, we assume that the Government&#13;
maintains the value of its consumption subsidies and wage increases relative&#13;
to the value of national per capita consumption; that is, dv /dt = 0.    We&#13;
further know that v     falls at a rate equal to the difference between the&#13;
rate at which current public investment can be transformed into future&#13;
public income and the CRI. Thus,&#13;
ARI = 0.52 [R - CR1 + CRI&#13;
where R is the average internal rate of return on public sector investment,&#13;
and depends on both q (annual profit) and T (the length of life of capital).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
Page 25&#13;
It is lower than the rate of return and makes no allowance for a finite&#13;
life of capital goods. A sensitivity analysis of the ARI is presented in&#13;
Table A-10.&#13;
1.29      Table A-10 reveals that the ARI is very low and could conceivably&#13;
be negative. For our best estimate of the annual profit on public sector&#13;
investment, the ARI varies from 1.24% for n = 1 to 1.96 for n = 2. The low&#13;
values for R should not be interpreted to mean that all public sector invest-&#13;
ments produces low returns. Nor should it be interpreted to mean that future&#13;
investment must also produce low returns. Projects have been identified&#13;
with high internal rates of returns. 1/ But other large investments, such&#13;
as the Karachi Steel Mills Project, may show very low or negative returns.&#13;
The Values of Domestic Savings and Government Borrowing&#13;
a. Saving and Lending to Government&#13;
1.30      We investigate the value of a person's saving of one rupee for&#13;
lending it to the Government forever at a rate of interest r. There are two&#13;
effects to consider. The first is the resultant redistribution of consumption&#13;
through time. There is a social loss from reduced consumption equal to&#13;
d /v (the social weight attaching to consumption of this i       person).  The&#13;
i&#13;
person's consumption rises in the future by r. The social present value of&#13;
this is ( r ) d./v, assuming no change in the future distribution of income,&#13;
CR1   i.&#13;
or the weighting system.    The net social loss is therefore (1 - C) d./v.&#13;
CR1   i&#13;
This assumes no tax paid on r.&#13;
1/   For example, the internal rate of return for the Multin Expansion Project&#13;
(Fertilizer) is estimated to be 28%, while the Dandot and Thatta Projects&#13;
(Cement) are shown to have positive NPVs at a 12% rate of discount, as is&#13;
the Textile Winding Machinery Project. See "Pakistan: Development Issues&#13;
and Policies", World Bank, April 1978 (attachments 5 and 6 to Volume I).&#13;

the present an amount equal to the CCF. In the future it loses r.CCF, which&#13;
has a social present value (      ) CCF.  The net gain is therefore&#13;

1.32      It appears that, after a period when real rates of interest on&#13;
savings deposits were negative, they have been restored to about 3%. This&#13;
is also our best estimate of the CRI. If, as would be reasonable, the&#13;
Government intends that real interest rates on savings deposits should remain&#13;
equal to the CRI, the second term vanishes. The social value of private&#13;
savings lent to the government is then positive or negative depending on&#13;
whether the ART exceeds (net of tax) r, or vice versa. Our best estimate&#13;
of the ARI is 2%, less than r. In consequence our best estimate of the&#13;
social value of private savings lent to the Government is negative, at&#13;
least for persons below the income tax limit. Indeed, the expression would&#13;
remain negative up to quite high marginal tax rates. People at such implied&#13;
high income levels are unlikely to devote much of their savings to the&#13;
'funds'. Thus a high proportion of private savings lent to the Government&#13;
results in social loss.&#13;
b. The Value of Private Savings Invested in Private Enterprise&#13;
1.33      We shall merely try to establish whether such savings/investment&#13;
has a positive or negative social value. For this purpose, we can, as before,&#13;
assume that the whole of the yield is consumed (reinvestment would merely&#13;
magnify the negativeness or positiveness of the result).&#13;
1.34      The social loss resulting from the changed intertemporal consump-&#13;
tion pattern is now (1 -   X              where r    is the private financial&#13;
tionpatern  s nw (  CRT  v                 p&#13;
rate of return.   It seems very probable that r &gt;    CRI, so that this&#13;
expression is very probably negative, i.e., there is a social gain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Appendix A&#13;

1.35      In terms of resources, the cost of a rupee spent on investment&#13;
is given by the capital goods conversion factor. The annual return is R,&#13;
signifying the social internal rate of return to private investment. This&#13;
should be discounted by the ARI, and converted to border prices by the SCF.&#13;
The gain in resources is therefore:&#13;
(R/ARI) SCF - Capital Goods Conversion Factor&#13;
Although we have not estimated R, it is almost inconceivable that it does&#13;
not exceed the ARI (2%). In Appendix B the SCF is also estimated to be&#13;
greater than the capital goods conversion factor. There is, therefore,&#13;
good reason to suppose that private savings which result in increased private&#13;
investment are socially beneficial.&#13;
The Value of Foreign Borrowing&#13;
1.36      In this section we investigate whether the accrual of an additional&#13;
unit of foreign exchange to the public sector should be used to expand expendi-&#13;
ture or to reduce foreign borrowing. Let the value of a marginal unit of&#13;
public sector expenditure in terms of average consumption be v and assume&#13;
initially that v is constant over time. The benefit of reducing foreign&#13;
borrowing is given by the net present value of the debt servicing which&#13;
has been avoided. If, at the margin of borrowing, a loan has a grace period&#13;
of t years, matures after T years, and carries an interest rate which implies&#13;
annual debt servicing in the period after the waiver of s%, it is economically&#13;
rational to expand public sector expenditure if:&#13;

where    i   is the consumption rate of interest and p      is the expected rate of&#13;
inflation for Pakistan's imports and exports. 1/&#13;
1.37       The above result is derived on the assumption that the value of&#13;
public income relative to consumption remains constant over time. It may&#13;
well be the case, however, that over time the value of public income changes.&#13;
Since the rate of change over time in the value of public income relative&#13;
to consumption is defined by the difference between the ARI and the CRI,&#13;
it follows that if we redefine i as the ARI, we have an expression which&#13;
allows explicitly for the need to discount (by the CRI) as well as the need&#13;
to allow for a changing value of v.&#13;
Nominal Cost of Foreign Borrowing&#13;
1.38       Pakistan's foreign borrowing by interest rate is shown in Table A-11.&#13;
Since FY74 over 15% of annual borrowing has been at rates of interest in excess&#13;
of 6%. Using the value of loans as weights, the average cost of borrowing for&#13;
loans at more than 6% is 8.4% for the period FY74 - FY77 inclusive, the number&#13;
of years to maturity (T) is 14.61 and the number of years' grace (t) is 3.10.&#13;
1/   We shall assume that during the grace period interest is not paid, but is&#13;
compounded to the end of the grace period and the resultant sum is repaid&#13;
in equal installments over subsequent years without any additional&#13;
"interest on interest."&#13;

Expected Rate of Inflation&#13;
1.39      Loans made now have to be repaid in the future.     In assessing the&#13;
real cost of borrowing, therefore, it is necessary to deflate by some expected&#13;
rate-of-inflation index. Since foreign loans have to be repaid in foreign&#13;
currency, it is appropriate to deflate by a weighted index of import and export&#13;
prices. Expected rates of inflation over the period FY78 - FY85 are assumed&#13;
to be 6.94% for all non-oil imports, 7.06% for oil imports, and 4.82% for&#13;
exports. 1/ Using the estimated FY77 and the projected FY78 and FY79 values&#13;
1/   These estimates are based on the price indices for petroleum, developed&#13;
countries' manufactured exports to all destinations and developing&#13;
countries' exports other than petroleum, as reported in " Commodity Price&#13;
Forecasts," World Bank, 1977.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

of imports and exports as weights, 1/ the resulting expected rate of&#13;
inflation is 6.26%.&#13;
1.40      These estimates are subject to two qualifications.     First, any&#13;
increase in borrowing may increase the ratio of annual (actual and pro-&#13;
jected) interest plus repayment of official foreign debt to actual and&#13;
projected export receipts or the ratio of debt service to public savings,&#13;
and both ratios are thought to influence the supply of loans; this may&#13;
render it more difficult or more expensive to borrow in the future. In&#13;
this event, one would want to use higher cost of borrowing than the one&#13;
reported here. A priori, however, it is not clear in which direction&#13;
increased foreign borrowing would affect these ratios, since it may be&#13;
presumed that the loans will have a positive effect on the numerator and&#13;
denominator of both ratios. Secondly, the projections involved in the&#13;
estimate of future inflation may be wrong. If our estimate is in error&#13;
by, say, +15%, the likely range of inflation rates is 7.20% to 5.32%.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis is employed to test the significance of these alter-&#13;
native assumptions concerning the rate of inflation.&#13;
1.41      Table A-12 presents a sensitivity analysis of the value of&#13;
foreign borrowing. Only if the value reported in the table is less than&#13;
one should the accrual of an additional unit of foreign exchange be used&#13;
to expand public sector expenditure rather than reduce foreign loans with&#13;
the given specifications. The table considers two types of loan. The first&#13;
is roughly equivalent to the average hard borrowing by Pakistan in the recent&#13;
1/   As reported in "Pakistan:    Current Developments and Issues - An Up-&#13;
dating Memorandum," World Bank, 1977. The weights are: 0.57 for&#13;
non-oil imports, 0.10 for oil imports and 0.33 for exports.&#13;

SHADOW WAGE RATE ESTIMATES&#13;
Introduction&#13;
2.1       The shadow wage rate estimates presented here are based on a&#13;
variety of data sources and assumptions. While care has been taken to&#13;
make the estimates as realistic as possible, it nevertheless remains the&#13;
case that additional information would be of considerable value in refining&#13;
the estimates and removing doubts and uncertainties. Wherever possible,&#13;
we indicate the major weaknesses, and hence areas of potential improve-&#13;
ment, throughout the text.&#13;
2.2       Estimates are presented for three different types of labor:&#13;
skilled and semi-skilled artisans, unskilled rural labor, and unskilled&#13;
urban labor. This categorization has the following rationale. First,&#13;
the recent increase in emigration to OPEC has mainly involved skilled and&#13;
semi-skilled artisans such as plumbers, carpenters, and bricklayers. To&#13;
assess the social worth of emigration it thus becomes important to estimate&#13;
the SWR of the migrating labor. Secondly, unskilled labor in large-scale&#13;
manufacturing and the public sector is protected by minimum wage legisla-&#13;
tion, which may lead to a distortion in the overall market for unskilled&#13;
labor. We have, therefore, estimated separate SWRs for unskilled labor in&#13;
rural and urban areas, the latter being further disaggregated according to&#13;
whether or not the labor is employed in sectors where wages are controlled&#13;
by the Government. Clearly, the rural SWR also warrants further disaggre-&#13;
gation especially by location. Given the limited data, the estimate&#13;
presented here should be considered appropriate for the Central Punjab, and&#13;
only illustrative for other regions. 1/&#13;
1/   The 1977 Agricultural Economic Survey of the Indus Basic being con-&#13;
ducted by the Water and Power Development Authority should provide a&#13;
rich source of data for updating and improving the estimates.&#13;

Population, Labor Force and Employment&#13;
2.3       Estimates of Pakistan's population vary considerably depending&#13;
on whether or not corrections are made for the suspected underenumeration&#13;
in the 1972 census. The figure cited by the Bank for 1977 is 79.75 million. 1/&#13;
However, it is a fact that population has been growing very rapidly: the&#13;
average intercensal (1961-72) growth rate is reported to be 3.5% p.a., while&#13;
the post-1972 growth rate is projected to be 3.1% p.a.&#13;
2.4        Participation rates are both low and apparently falling:    the&#13;
1961 census yields a participation rate of 32.4% compared to a Labor Force&#13;
Survey estimate of 29.5% for 1974/75. 2/ The low participation rate reflects&#13;
the very few women in the labor force: in 1972 women accounted for only&#13;
8.8% of the total labor force. Despite the declining participation rate,&#13;
the labor force has increased at a rate of 2.6 to 2.7% p.a. between 1961&#13;
and 1975.&#13;
2.5       Table B-1 presents the available information on the sectoral&#13;
distribution of employment. According to the 1969/70 and 1974/75 Labor&#13;
Force Surveys, total employment increased at a rate of 2.5% p.a., with&#13;
most of the growth occurring in large-scale industry, construction and&#13;
services. Agricultural employment grew at a rate of 1.9% p.a., while&#13;
employment in small-scale manufacturing apparently declined.&#13;

2.8        Information on labor utilization in rural areas is limited to a&#13;
FY72 survey 1/ of the Punjab which covered 40 villages with an average&#13;
population of 280 households and a land area of 1.366 acres. Within each&#13;
village 10 separate households were interviewed giving a total sample size&#13;
of only 400 households. The survey revealed that 54.5% of households owned&#13;
land, 15.0% were tenants, 11.7% were landless and 18.8% were artisans,&#13;
shopkeepers and others.&#13;
2.9       The rural labor market is most active during the harvesting season.&#13;
The survey reports that 5.4 man-days of hired labor are required for harvesting&#13;
an acre of w7heat; 3.3 man-days to transplant an acre of paddy and a furt.aer&#13;
6.3 for harvesting; 11.9 man-days are required for cotton picking; 3.7 days&#13;
for sugarcane cutting, and 10.9 man-days for making native sugar. Despi.e&#13;
the apparent concentration on harvesting activities, seasonal variations in&#13;
employment of landless laborers are not great. Permanent laborers (tho,&#13;
hired for an entire cropping cycle or longer) worked, on average, 29.0&#13;
days per month with minimal seasonal variation, and casual laborers (those&#13;
hired on a daily basis) 11.3 days per month with a maximum of 16.4 days in&#13;
October and a minimum of 8.6 days in December. Of the total of 136 days&#13;
worked per year by casual laborers, 54 were in nonagricultural activities&#13;

and 82 in agriculture. Nonagricultural activities probably allow the land-&#13;
less laborer at least some opportunity to even out his labor supply through&#13;
the year.&#13;
2.10      With such low levels of labor utilization among the landless, 1/&#13;
the role of rural-urban migration and changes in real wage rates become&#13;
important subjects for investigation. With regard to migration, 19% of&#13;
households claimed at least one outmigrant, but only 4.9% had one or more&#13;
members of the household working outside, but still residing within the&#13;
village. Twenty-one percent of landowner households, 13% of tenant house-&#13;
holds, 18% of landless households and 21% of artisan and shopkeeping house-&#13;
holds reported at least one migrant. Those migrating from landowning house-&#13;
holds were usually relatively well educated and took jobs almost exclusively&#13;
in the military or government service. Tenants and landless laborers, on the&#13;
other hand, had received minimal education and were only able to find work as&#13;
unskilled laborers.&#13;
2.11      Overall internal migration rates are low.   Census information&#13;
on lifetime migrants reveals that between 1961 and 1972 the most important&#13;
migration stream was from Baluchistan to Punjab (443,000 persons). The&#13;
two most economically advanced provinces, Punjab and Sind are attracting&#13;
population from the other two provinces , North West Frontier Province (NWFP)&#13;
and Baluchistan. During the same period, the urban population increased&#13;
from 22.5% to 25.5% with the greatest expansion occurring in the three&#13;
largest cities (Karachi, Lahore, and Lyallpur).&#13;
1/   The Labor Force Survey suggests higher levels of rural labor utiliza-&#13;
tion. The 1969/70 LFS reports 9.53% of the rural labor force working&#13;
less than 35 hours in the reference week and the 1971-72 LFS reports&#13;
a similar figure of 9.34%.&#13;

2.12      Apart from Census data, several studies appearing in the early&#13;
1970s suggest that annual migration out of the rural sector is at least&#13;
100,000 laborers: 60,000 in Punjab, 25,000 in NWFP, and 15,000 in Sind, no&#13;
data being available for Baluchistan. 1/ Looked at from the urban side, the&#13;
1971-72 Labor Force Survey reports that 2.5% of the urban population of&#13;
Pakistan migrated there within the last year. The 1975 Rawalpindi Survey&#13;
also yields a low rate of annual immigration (roughly 1.5%). 2/&#13;
Trends in Real Wage Rates 3/&#13;
2.13      Time series data on real wage rates for selected years are pre-&#13;
sented in Table B-2. While the reported data are subject to a number of&#13;
qualifications, the general direction of wage rate movements is clear.&#13;
The real wage of production workers in large scale private manufacturing&#13;
has increased at a rate of around 3% p.a. since 1960; public sector real&#13;
wage rates, on the other hand, declined, with senior civil servants experi-&#13;
encing a much larger decrease than their juniors; wages in the urban informal&#13;
sector are less well doucmented, but evidence from the Rawalpindi surveys&#13;
suggests that urban informal workers did not suffer a deterioration in living&#13;
standards over the period 1960-75, and may even have enjoyed a slight&#13;
improvement; and finally, data on agricultural wage rates for the Punjab&#13;
reveal real rates of increase of approximately 1.3% p.a.&#13;

2.14      From Table B-2 we calculated that real wages for casual labor in&#13;
agriculture increased at a rate of 2.6% p.a. between 1966/67 and 1972/73&#13;
whereas production workers in large scale private manufacturing enjoyed&#13;
a rate of increase of 4.5% p.a. during the same period. Taking the agri-&#13;
cultural wage as an index of labor's supply price, on the grounds that it&#13;
is unlikely to be subject to non-market forces, the question arises as to&#13;
why the manufacturing wage has increased at a faster rate than labor's&#13;
supply price. One possibility is that the change in the manufacturing&#13;
wage represents a change in the skill composition of the labor force.&#13;
However, there is good reason to believe that at least part of the 26%&#13;
increase in money wages (21% increase in real wages) 1/ between 1967-68&#13;
and 1969-70 can be attributed to non-market forces since in 1969 the&#13;
Government issued the Industrial Relations Ordinance, which, among other&#13;
things, included a new minimum wage which was rigorously enforced. Further&#13;
reforms in February 1972 are reported to have added more than 22% to the&#13;
earnings of workers during FY73. In August 1973 the Employee Cost of&#13;
Living (Relief) Ordinance was adopted which has since resulted in three&#13;
cost-of-living adjustments; Rs. 35 per month in August 1973; Rs. 50 in&#13;
June 1974; and Rs. 25 in April 1975. Thus, a worker in an industrial&#13;
area outside Karachi earning the statutory minimum wage of Rs. 125 in&#13;
June 1973 was earning Rs. 235 by June 1975; that is, an increase of&#13;
88% in two years. It is unlikely that such rapid increases can be&#13;
attributed to market forces.&#13;

2.15      As shown in Table B-2, public sector wages have not followed the&#13;
same pattern as private sector wages. This may reflect a decision to bring&#13;
public sector wages more in line with private sector wages. Thus, in 1959&#13;
unskilled public sector workers 1/ received wages that were 37% higher than&#13;
the average wage of all production workers in manufacturing. By 1971/72&#13;
unskilled public sector workers received 3% less than production workers and&#13;
by the mid-seventies they received more than 20% less than the average pro-&#13;
duction workers. Whether intentional or not, the changing public sector&#13;
salary scales have probably removed a distortion between the private and&#13;
public sectors.&#13;
2.16      The data on rural wages are clearly less reliable than those&#13;
for the manufacturing and public sectors. The timing of the wage surveys&#13;
is thought by some to have resulted in an overestimate of the growth rate. 2/&#13;
But the survey of Rural Labor in Punjab suggests some increase in rural&#13;
wages. Most payments at harvesting time are in kind in terms of fixed&#13;
shares (e.g., 7.75% for rice harvesting), but for rice transplanting a cash&#13;
payment is involved. The average wage for this activity was Rs. 8.68 per&#13;
acre in FY66 but had increased to Rs. 13.19 by FY71, an increase of 18% in&#13;
real terms. Eckert also reports a 20% increase in real wages for village&#13;
construction labor. Again the evidence is not as reliable as one would&#13;
like, but what evidence there is suggests an increasing real wage rate for&#13;
rural labor, although the rate of increase remains uncertain.&#13;

2.17      The same survey provides some interesting information on rural-&#13;
urban migration. Most of the migrants were assured, or reasonably confident&#13;
of obtaining, a job before they left. The wages received by migrants fell&#13;
in the range of Rs. 90-300 monthly with a mean of Rs. 128.6. By way of&#13;
comparison, average monthly incomes for landless workers were Rs. 39 for&#13;
permanent laborers and Rs. 35 for casual laborers. The benefits of migra-&#13;
tion thus appear to be considerable. The landless laborers, however, as noted&#13;
earlier, can obtain employment only as unskilled laborers and must, therefore,&#13;
earn less-than the average wage reported above (but still more than Rs. 90).&#13;
In addition, several respondents suggested that Rs. 2.00 in the town was worth&#13;
only as much as Rs. 1.00 in the village, implying that an urban wage of&#13;
Rs. 90 is really only equivalent to a rural wage of Rs. 45. When offered&#13;
the hypothetical choice of the same job and the same wage in the town or in&#13;
the village, 96% chose the village and of these 61% cited the cost-of-living&#13;
differential as the main reason for their preference. Such factors probably&#13;
account for the low rate of migration, even though the monetary returns are&#13;
large and relatively secure. 1/&#13;
Recent Developments&#13;
2.18      The increasing rate of emigration to OPEC countries has apparently&#13;
led to a tightening of the market for skilled and semi-skilled artisans.&#13;
Table B-3 presents wage data for masons and carpenters employed in the con-&#13;
struction sector. In both Karachi and Lahore real wage rates remained more&#13;
or less constant through the period July 1974 to July 1975, but then increased&#13;
1/   Data from the Rawalpindi Survey 1975 indicate that recent migrants are&#13;
not any worse off in terms of employment or income than the resident&#13;
population.&#13;
&#13;

during FY76 (the real wage increasing by 12% in Karachi and 13X in Lahore),&#13;
and again in the first half of FY77 (by 9% in Karachi and 4% to 25% in Lahore).&#13;
For Islamabad, however, the period July 1974 to July 1975 witnesses a very&#13;
rapid increase in regl wage rates (over 20%) but from relatively low initial&#13;
levels.  The increase in FY76 (nearly 40%) is also very large, but that in&#13;
the first half of FY77 (6%) is similar to that of the other cities. Whether&#13;
the FY75 data for Islamabad are incorrect, or whether they reflect a local&#13;
adjustment process, i8 not clear. However, it is clear that real wages for&#13;
artisans increased rapidly during FY76 and the first half of FY77.    That these&#13;
increases in real wage rates should occur at a time when emigration was&#13;
increasing rapidly is convincing evidence that foreign 4emand was exerting&#13;
an upward pressure on wage rates.   Thus, official emigration rose from 3,534&#13;
in FY71 to 16,328 in FY74, and to an estimated 30,000 in FY76.    Illegal&#13;
emigration may increase the true FY76 figure to 50,000 or 60,000 migrants.&#13;
Of recorded migrants- between 1971 and 1975, 5.5% were professional (doctors,&#13;
engineers, accountants), 2.4X were teachers, 43.3%.were skilled and.semi-&#13;
skilled artisans (welders, masons, carpenters, plumbers, mechanics), 15.4%&#13;
were laborers, and 33.4% were not categorized. With an allowance made for&#13;
returning migrants, there are thought to be 720,000 Pakistanis living&#13;
abroad, of which 350,000 are resident in the UK, and 250,000 in OPEC&#13;
countries. 1/  Moreover, whereas the UK migrant population is now stable,&#13;
much of the OPEC migrant population is thought to be of relatively recent&#13;
origin.&#13;

2.19       An increasing rate of emigration may also have affected wage rates&#13;
and'employment of other types of labor. This does not, however, appear to&#13;
be the case as far as teachers are concerned. A recent study of teacher&#13;
training institutions in Karachi revealed that, after more than a year after&#13;
graduation, 56% of teachers were unemployed. 1/ The excess supply is presumably&#13;
a direct consequence of the expansion in educational facilities described&#13;
earlier.&#13;
2.20      With regard to unskilled construction labor, the wage rate data&#13;
presented in Table B-4 suggest that emigration has not yet caused a serious&#13;
tightening of the market, although the latest observations for Karachi indicate&#13;
that such a tightening may occur in the second half of FY77 and in FY78. That&#13;
emigration has had a more significant impact on skilled and semi-skilled labor&#13;
than on unskilled labor is not surprising; the proportion of migrants in total&#13;
labor is much larger for the former group than for the latter group, and the&#13;
former's supply curve must be at least in the short run, less elastic than&#13;
that of the latter.&#13;
2.21      The other recent development in the labor market has been the intro-&#13;
duction of new pay scales for government employees in late FY77. For the&#13;
lowest paid worker the increase amounts to Rs. 140 per month compared to an&#13;
existing wage (including benefits) of Rs. 245 per month. Increases at other&#13;
levels, however, have not been (relatively) so large; the ratio of the lowest&#13;
to the highest wage which was 1:26 in 1972 will now be lowered to 1:13. The&#13;

SWR for Skilled and Semi-Skilled Artisans&#13;
2.22      Based on the evidence on rates of emigration and wage rates for&#13;
skilled and semi-skilled artisans in the construction sector, wage deter-&#13;
mination for such labor is assumed to be subject to the forces of supply and&#13;
demand. 1/ We further assume that in the short-run the relevant labor supply&#13;
curve is perfectly inelastic: that is, Pakistan has a given supply of artisans&#13;
which has to,be distributed between domestic and foreign demanders. 2/ In the&#13;
long run, however, supply will presumably expand. Accordingly, we first esti-&#13;
mate a short-run SWR (supply perfectly inelastic) and then estimate a long-run&#13;
SWR (supply perfectly elastic).&#13;
2.23      In the short-run analysis, therefore, an increase in demand (for&#13;
example, from a new project) will be satisfied by an increase in the wage&#13;
which will both reduce emigration and draw labor from domestic employment. 3/&#13;
1/ The construction sector is not covered by mi'nimum wage legislation.&#13;
2/   This is not implausible given the dramatic increase in emigration&#13;
(a 100% increase between FY74 and FY76), and the associated increase&#13;
in the real wage for artisans (30% from November 1974 to December 1976&#13;
in Karachi; see Table B-4).&#13;
3/   An actual return of migrants would be inhibited by contracts, so the&#13;
short run analysis presumes a continuing outflow which would be influ-&#13;
enced by wages in Pakistan.&#13;

If  nF    and    nD   are the demand elasticities (defined so as to be positive)&#13;

where    a    is the proportion of labor working abroad,     w  is the market wage,&#13;
and dE/E is the proportionate increase in demand.&#13;
2.24.     The SWR for an artisan, therefore, should comprise the cost to tL.&#13;
economy of foregoing     w   migrants, plus the cost of withdrawing (1-,)&#13;
workers from other domestic employment, plus the cost of an increase in the&#13;
(1-~') w dE&#13;
domestic wage of (l~U)n    E d      Each of these elements is considered bel.w.&#13;
D&#13;
2.25      Since there are no constraints on emigration, it may be argued&#13;
that at the margin an artisan is indifferent between emigrating and renm- ning&#13;
in Pakistan; that is we assume that at the margin there is no private (c-&#13;
social) benefit accruing to the emigrant. If we also assume that remit ances&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

are entirely consumed then the social cost of foregoing one migrant (SWR ) is&#13;
m&#13;
given by:&#13;
SWR      R + (w - R) CCF&#13;
where R is remittances, (w-R) is the increase in consumption in the domestic&#13;
economy as a result of non-migration, and CCF is the consumption conversion&#13;
factor. For FY77 average remittances from emigrants in OPEC are estimated&#13;
to be Rs. 17,028. 1/ By December, the mid-point of FY77, the daily wage for&#13;
masons and carpenters in Karachi was Rs. 41 (see Table B-4), which, on the&#13;
assumption of a 26 day working month, yields an annual wage income of Rs.&#13;
12,792. The CCF for urban households was estimated to be approximately 0.8&#13;
(see Appendix C, para. 3.21). On this basis, the SWR for migrants work out&#13;
at 1.07w.&#13;
2.26      But the assumption of zero savings from remittances is probably&#13;
objectionable on two grounds. First, most emigrants expect to return, since&#13;
they are on limited contracts. In this event one can expect a considerable&#13;
part of remittances to be saved as a nest-egg for their return (this has been&#13;
found to be the case in other countries with emigrant labor, such as Portugal).&#13;
Secondly, it would be surprising if the emigrant deliberately increased t-he&#13;
standard of living of the family left behind by as much as the above figures&#13;
suggest. A more reasonable assumption might be to suppose that emigrants'&#13;
1/   The country economist estimates 250,000 emigrants residing in OPEC&#13;
in FY77 and a figure of $430 million for total FY77 remittances from&#13;
OPEC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
Appendix B&#13;
Page 18&#13;
family maintained the same standard of living as when the emigrant was at&#13;
home. In this case, there are savings and it becomes necessary to make a&#13;
further assumption about how these savings are used.     If they are lent to&#13;
the Government we can use the estimation procedure of Appendix A, paras.&#13;
1.30-1.32. The resource cost of non-migration can then be written:&#13;
R + CCF [wa - {R-w(l-a)} ARI&#13;
where       is an emigrant's share in family consumption, and     r    is the&#13;
real rate of interest on money lent to the Government. The first term is&#13;
remittances, the second is the cost of extra domestic consumption in the&#13;
first year, and the third term is the benefit of reduced future consumption.&#13;
If r = ARI the expression reduces to the previous one, since savings and&#13;
consumption become socially indifferent.&#13;
2.27      Arbitrarily assuming that a = 1/4, taking the values of r = .03&#13;
and ARI = .02 from Appendix A, and otherwise using the same estimates as&#13;
before we get the result that SWR       .83w.  This, however, may well be too&#13;
low, since savings may well, after the migrant returns, be more productively&#13;
used than lent to the government. It is also possible that the assumption of&#13;
a 26-day working month for migrants was too high. If we instead assume a&#13;
5-day week the annual income becomes Rs. 9,840.     The estimates of SWR /w&#13;
corresponding to the above two formulae become 1.12 and .75. There is so&#13;
much guess work involved here that one might as well choose one as the best&#13;
estimate, while noting that one could err quite a lot.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Appendix P&#13;
Page 19&#13;
2.28      We next look at the cost of drawing this type of labor from domestic&#13;
employment. If we assume that labor is drawn from a variety of sectors, both&#13;
tradable and nontradable, it is probably most appropriate to identify the value&#13;
of output foregone with the market wage multiplied by the standard conversion&#13;
factor (SCF).   The shadow wage of domestic labor (SWR D), therefore, is given&#13;
by:.&#13;
SWR   = w SCF&#13;
D&#13;
Our estimate of the SCF is 0.85, so that:&#13;
SWRD&#13;
- = 0.85&#13;
w&#13;
That is, the opportunity cost of labor drawn from domestic employment is 85%&#13;
of the market wage.&#13;
2.29      We next have to estimate the social cost of the change in the wage&#13;
rate, which implies a transfer of income from employees or consumers to&#13;
employees equal to &#143;(1-7f) dE  . We estimated previously that the income of&#13;
artisans in FY77 is Rs. 12,792. This indicates a high income compared to&#13;
the average per capita consumption of Rs. 1,614 in FY77. If we assume that&#13;
artisans lie in the fourth population quintile, then average household size&#13;
is 6.9 and each household possesses 1.7 earners. 1/ Assuming that the other&#13;

Survey, 1971-72," Ministry of Finance, Planning and Development,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Appendix B&#13;
Page 20&#13;
0.7 earners are unskilled workers with an annual income of Rs. 4,704, I/&#13;
total family income is Rs. 16,085 and per capita income is Rs. 2,331. The&#13;
distribution weight (d/v) appropriate for such an income is 0.55 if n=1 and&#13;
0.40 if n=2. 2/&#13;
2.30      Next we need the income distriution weight for those losing income.&#13;
If we assume that wage increases in the non-tradable construction sectors are&#13;
passed on to consumers, as a first approximation we can say that as a result&#13;
of higher prices for construction services consumers throughout the economy&#13;
suffer a loss of real income If this is assumed to be in proportion to their&#13;
existing income, then, using the summary income distribution parameter, 3/&#13;
the weight (D/v) to be attached to the loss of income is 0.80 if n=1 and&#13;
1.08 if n=2.&#13;
2.31      This, however, clearly cannot be considered a very satisfactory&#13;
estimate for a number of reasons. First, construction services are a much&#13;
more important item in the budget of urban consumers than in that of rural&#13;
consumers. Since expenditure of urban households is on average 30% higher&#13;
than that for rural consumers, the social value of their loss of income&#13;
should be 0.62 if n=1 and 0.50 if n=2. 4/ Secondly, expenditure on coa-&#13;
struction services increases with income. The loss of income, therefore,&#13;
1/   Calculated assuming a wage of Rs. 19.6 per day in FY77 (see Table B-5)&#13;
and 20 working days per month.&#13;
2/   Calculated from the formula W = (c/c) /v where v = 1.25 for n=1 and&#13;
1.2 for n=2. If we assume that an artisan's wage income is only&#13;
Rs. 9,840 (see above) but retain the other assumptions, the distribu-&#13;
tion weight is 0.68 if n=1 and 0.60 if n=2.&#13;

Page 21&#13;
increases more than proportionately with income. The above analysis conse-&#13;
quently overestimates the true value of the income loss and the overestimation&#13;
is greater for n=2 than for n=1. Thirdly, some of the transfer will be from&#13;
the public sector if it now has to pay higher prices either directly or in-&#13;
directly for construction services.   The cost to the Government is then equal&#13;
to its loss in real income which may be evaluated by application of the SCF&#13;
(=0.85).  Finally, if wage increases are not passed on completely there will&#13;
be a reduction in profits in the construction sector; and, even if they are&#13;
completely passed on, profit loss may occur in other sectors using construc-&#13;
tion services. We have not calculated a weight for private profits but it&#13;
is clear that it will depend on the allocation of profits between consumption&#13;
and reinvestment. That part consumed will receive a low 'weight if it is&#13;
thought that profits accrue to the relatively rich, but private reinvestment&#13;
may warrant a fairly high weight. We have no information on this latter&#13;
weight but note that private investment is estimated to be only 4.7% of GDP&#13;
and private saving to be only 9.5% of GNP in FY78. It may not be too mislead-&#13;
ing, therefore, if we argue that the weight to be attached to private profits&#13;
is not likely to be large since the major proportion presumably accrues to&#13;
consumption. For example, if 50% of profits is consumed and profits accrue&#13;
to those in the top quintile (d = 005 for n=1 and 0.3 for n=2) the weight on&#13;
v&#13;
private savings would have to be in excess of 1.5 if n=1 and in excess of 1.7&#13;
if n=2 before the weight assigned to profits would exceed unity.&#13;

2.32      All the possibilities described above are likely to occur to some&#13;
extent. On the basis of the above arguments, and in the absence of any more&#13;
concrete information, we choose to experiment with weights for the loss in&#13;
income of between 0.6 and 0.9 for both n=1 and n=2. Given the value of the&#13;
income transfer to artisans as computed above, the net cost of any transfer&#13;
can be obtained by weighting the market price value of the transfer by 0.35&#13;
to 0.05 if n=1 and by 0.50 to 0.20 if n=2.&#13;
2.33      Our SWR for artisans as a proportion of the market wage may now&#13;
be written as:&#13;
S    WR   +  (1-7T) [0.85 + W- &#13;
where W* is the weight assigned to the income transfer. The income transfer&#13;
may also cause a change in the real resource content of expenditure if the&#13;
CCFs for the two groups are different. This possibility has been ignored&#13;
here, on the grounds that it is unlikely to be of any quantitative signifi-&#13;
cance. Sensitivity analysis is conducted with respect to the elasticity of&#13;
foreign demand ( nF which determines iT), the elasticity of domestic demand&#13;
( ND) and the weight (W*) to be assigned to income transfers. For the&#13;
SWR&#13;

2.34      To interpret Tables B-5 we first note that, if foreign demand is&#13;
perfectly elastic (n F- e ), it = 1.0, and  w  = 1.00, there being no with-&#13;
drawal of labor from domestic employment and no increase in the domestic wage.&#13;
It seems reasonable to postulate a highly elastic foreign demand but it may&#13;
1/&#13;
not be perfectly so.    Accordingly, we experiment with values of n = 0.9 and&#13;
0.8.  Ilowever, even if we set nF &lt; - (but assume that it is large relative to n )D&#13;
and allow for an increase in the domestic wage, SWR still falls in the range&#13;
0.98 to 1.11 for n=1 and 1.00 to 1.17 for n=2. For our best estimates, we&#13;
take SWR = 1.05 for n=1 and n=2 with a range of 1.00 to 1.10. The choice of&#13;

l/  A recent (1975) Bank staff estimate suggests that Pakistanis constitute&#13;
only 21% of the emigrant (Asia and Arab only) labor force in Libya, Iran,&#13;
Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, U.A.R. and Oman. If the&#13;
proportion (a) of emigrant artisans in Pakistan's total complement of&#13;
artisans is 0.2, the f=0.9 requires that    nF  be 36 times as large as&#13;
nD; and if  n=0.8, nF must be 16 times as large as nD.     These numbers&#13;
are not implausible since the elasticity of foreign demand facing&#13;
Pakistan is given by [nw + (l-a)c]/a    where  n   is the elasticity of&#13;
demand for all migrants, E is the elasticity of foreign supply and a&#13;
is Pakistan's share in total migration.    If nw  and  e both equal 4&#13;
and a = 0.2, then the elasticity facing Pal:istan is 36.&#13;

best estimates is based on the views that, first the elasticity of foreign&#13;
demand is probably highly elastic (i.e., ir&gt;0.9) and, second, the estimated&#13;
income of artisans may be on the high side. 1/ Both these arguments lead to&#13;
the conclusion that the best estimate should be located in the lower half of&#13;
the range.   The estimates are, however, very sensitive to the value of     w m&#13;
SWR&#13;
For example, if      m = 0.8  rather than 1.0 (see para. 2.27), the estimates in&#13;
Table B-5 have to be reduced by 0.18 for T=O.9 and by 0.16 for n    = 0.8.   Alter-&#13;
SWR&#13;
natively, if the true value of           1.1, the estimates in Table B-5 should&#13;
w&#13;
be increased by 0.09 for U=0.9    and by 0.08 for n = 0.8.    This sensitivity&#13;
underlines the importance of additional information on income levels of emi-&#13;
grants and the use made of remittances. For the purposes of this analysis,&#13;
we note the uncertainty of our estimates but retain the best estimates des-&#13;
cribed above.&#13;
2.35       In the longer run, however, Pakistan can meet increased demand for&#13;
labor by expanding supply. We turn now, therefore, to a calculation of the&#13;
long-run SWR for artisans. Essentially, this involves calculating the social&#13;
cost of taking one worker from the ranks of the unskilled and training him to&#13;
the appropriate skill level. The SWR for an artisan in this instance may be&#13;
written as:&#13;
1/   A 1975 Survey of those employed in the construction of the Indus Super-&#13;
highway revealed that 61.7% of skilled and semi-construction workers&#13;
received between Rs. 10 and Rs. 20 per day and that only 25.8% received&#13;
more than Rs. 20. Since then money wages have increased by Rs. 10 to&#13;
Rs. 15 but it may still be the case that our use of a figure of Rs. 41&#13;
per day is too high. If, however, we reduce the assumed income of arti-&#13;
sans by 25% (see para. 2.27), SWR/w stays in the range 1.00 to l.2C for W=0.9&#13;
and for n=l and n=2. These estimates are, however, slightly higher than&#13;
those reported in Table B-5.&#13;

where SWR is the social cost of employing a worker as an artisan if the con-&#13;
U&#13;
ditions of employment were the same as those enjoyed in his previous occupation&#13;
(i.e., the SWR of an unskilled worker), Aw is the increase in wage income as a&#13;
result of the worker's movement up the skill ladder, CCF is the consumption&#13;
conversion factor, w the relevant distribution weight and T represents training&#13;
costs. If the labor is required for a period of one year, T may be interpreted&#13;
as K, total investment cost per trained worker, less K/(1+r) where r is the&#13;
ARI; that is, if, after one year, the worker is available for employment else-&#13;
where, the economy can afford to train one less workers, so that the training&#13;
costs implied by the use of an artisan for one year are given by:&#13;
T    (l+r)&#13;
2.36     Aw is given by the difference between an artisan's annual wage income&#13;
(Rs. 12,792) and an unskilled worker's annual wage income (Rs. 4,707); that is,&#13;

worker comprises 1.27 wage earners and 4.12 family members, 1/ per capita&#13;
income before training is Rs. 1,451 and Rs. 3,412 after training. Using the&#13;
formula for non-marginal changes in income, 2/ the relevant distribution&#13;
weight (w) is computed to be 0.57 if n=1 and 0O44 if n=2      We retain the value&#13;

mated to be Rs. 3,561. 1/ In addition, the removal of one worker from unskilled&#13;
employment leads to the hiring of another worker which involves a cost equal to&#13;
SWR .   If the ARI is thought to be 2%, SCF = 0.85, and training is assumed to&#13;
last one year, we can calculate T as:&#13;
T = [K x SCF + SWRj] &#13;
l+r&#13;
= 133.2 if n=l, and&#13;
= 128.6 if n=2.&#13;
2.38      Using the SWR equation in para. 2.35, we can now arrive at the follow-&#13;
ing estimates of the SWR for artisans.    First, if n=1,         0.44; second, if&#13;
w                                   w&#13;
n=2, SwR = 0.52. On the basis of this estimate it is clearly profitable to&#13;
produce artisans, since the short run marginal social benefit of an artisan was&#13;
estimated earlier to be 1.05w for n=1 and n=2 (that is, the SWR for artisans if&#13;
supply is perfectly inelastic).&#13;
2.39      Our estimate of training costs may, however, be based on very&#13;
imperfect information. We calculate, therefore, the maximum training cost&#13;
consistent with a positive social profit for labor emigration. Whether n-1&#13;
or n=2, training costs would have to be in excess of Rs. 300,000 before&#13;
emigration would cease to be socially profitable. By way of comparison,&#13;
government costs for engineers and physicians are estimated to be Rs. 43,643&#13;
and Rs. 52,461, respectively. It is unlikely, therefore, that our conclusion&#13;
1/   "Pakistan: Economic Development and Prospects," World Bank, 1977, p. 48.&#13;
It is not clear what has been included in this estimate, but it is clear&#13;
that it excludes labor's opportunity cost. Nor is it clear how long the&#13;
training is supposed to last.&#13;

will be reversed even if training costs are considerably higher than the&#13;
figures used here.&#13;
2.40      A more important source of error arises if the estimate of the&#13;
wage increase is incorrect. We have suggested earlier that an estimate of&#13;
Rs. 12,792 for artisan wage income may be too high and have experimented with&#13;
a lower figure of Rs. 9,840. On this assumption, the increase in wage income&#13;
is Rs. 5,133 and     w     for n=1 increases to 0.48 but that for n=2 falls to&#13;
0.50 (cf. para. 2.38). -Training artisans, nevertheless, still appears to be&#13;
socially profitable.&#13;
SWR Estimates for Unskilled Rural Labor&#13;
2.41       Our estimates of SWRs for unskilled labor are based on the following&#13;
assumptions concerning the operation of the labor market. First, we assume&#13;
that labor supply at the unskilled level is highly elastic even in the short&#13;
run; the evidence here is primarily the low levels of labor utilization exper-&#13;
ienced by casual laborers in the rural sector. Secondly, labor supply is not&#13;
thought to be perfectly elastic since the real wage has been increasing,&#13;
albeit slightly, in the late 60s and early 70s. Third, migration to villages&#13;
and towns is assumed to be completely unrestricted. Since migrants can&#13;
apparently find jobs in various sectors of the village or town economy rela-&#13;
tively easily, urban-rural wage differentials are thought to reflect the pri-&#13;
vate costs of migration.&#13;
2.42      Armed with these assumptions, an expansion in the demand for&#13;
unskilled labor in the rural sector (e.g., from a new project) will result&#13;
in a small increase in the wage rate. If s is the elasticity of labor supply&#13;
for all sectors, nR the elasticity of labor demand in rural areas and n      the&#13;
corresponding elasticity in the urban sector, and a is the proportion of&#13;
the unskilled labor force in the rural sector, we can deduce that:&#13;

proportionate increase in demand. We need, therefore, to evaluate the social&#13;
cost of drawing labor from non-work activities, from rural and urban employment,&#13;
as well as the social cost of the income transfer implied by the rise in the&#13;
wage rate. 2/&#13;
2.43      Provided we accept the assumption that there is no institutional&#13;
constraint limiting migration and that there is no institutional constraint&#13;
on the rural wage, at the margin no private benefit accrues to a newly&#13;
recruited worker; that is, the loss in terms of leisure is exactly compen-&#13;
sated by the wage payment. Consumption, however, will increase by the extent&#13;
of the wage payment. The appropriate measure of social cost, therefore, is&#13;
the wage payment multiplied by the consumption conversion factor for rural&#13;
households which we have estimated to be 0.8.&#13;
1/   This derivation rests on the assumption that the percentage change in the&#13;
wage for urban employment is the same as that for rural employment.&#13;
2/   As in the emigration analysis, we assume that any change in the real&#13;
resource content of expenditure caused by the rise in the wage rate is&#13;
quantitatively insignificant.&#13;

2.44      The cost of withdrawing labor from rural employment is computed on&#13;
the assumption that hired (casual) labor is withdrawn from different activi-&#13;
ties in the same proportion as they are used in those activities. The relevant&#13;
calculation is set out in Table B-6. Since two of the most ij,portant crops&#13;
(rice and cotton) are subject to export taxes and the major imported crop&#13;
(wheat) is subsidized, the social cost of foregone output is 1.08 times its&#13;
market cost.&#13;
2.45      The social cost of withdrawing labor from urban employment is&#13;
assumed to be given by the SCF = 0.85. In addition, total,consumption declines&#13;
because rural wages are lower than urban wages, 1/ the value of which is given&#13;
by (w  - wR ) CCF, where CCF is the consumption conversion factor and equals&#13;
0.8.&#13;

wage rate may be computed as follows.   First,&#13;
Wu (1-w 1I 2)  dE&#13;
nu&#13;
represents the transfer from urban employers to urban employees where is the&#13;
urban wage. As before, we assume that the cost to urban employers is in the&#13;
range 0.6 to 0.9 for n=1 and n=2 (see paragraph 2.32 above). According to Rural&#13;
Labor Survey unskilled labor could earn approximately Rs. 90.0 per month in the&#13;
urban sector in FY72. Assuming 1.27 income earners and 4.12 family members, 2/&#13;

tion on migration.&#13;

this translates into a per capita income of Rs. 27.7 per month. This compares&#13;
with average per capita income of Rs. 46.1 per month, which implies weights&#13;
of 1.33 for n=1 and 2.31 for n=2.     The net weight (W*u), therefore, applicable&#13;
to the income transfer in the urban sector is -0.73 to -0.43 for n=1 and -1.71&#13;
to -1.41 for n=2.&#13;
WR2 2dE&#13;
2.47       Second,        represents the transfer from rural employers to rural&#13;
iR&#13;
employees where wR is the rural wage. Income data on employers and emRloyees&#13;
is taken from the Survey of Rural Labor. Annual per capita incomes in FY72 are&#13;
estimated to be Rs. 1,102 for large farmers, Rs. 318 for small farmers, Rs. 200&#13;
for tenant farmers, and Rs. 192 for permanent laborers and Rs. 173 for casual&#13;
laborers. On the employer side, according to Eckert, large farmers account&#13;
for 0.26 of the wage bill, small farmers 0.53 and tenant farmers 0.21. And&#13;
on the employee side, permanent laborers receive 0.40 of the wage bill and&#13;
casual laborers receive 0.60. With average annual per capita income equal to&#13;
Rs. 553 (Rs. 46.1 x 12), the cost of the transfer is given by the sum of the&#13;
shares in the wage bill times the relevant distribution weight, that is, by&#13;
(.26 x .40) + (.53 x 1.39) + (.21 x 2.21) = 1.30 for n=l and by (.26 x .21)&#13;
+ (.53 x 2.52) + (G21 x 6.37) = 2.73 for n=2. And, similarly, the benefit&#13;
of the transfer is given by (.40 x 2.31) + (.60 x 2.56) = 2.46 for n=1 and&#13;
by (.40 x 6.91) + (o60 x 8.52) = 7.87. It follows that the net benefit&#13;
(W*r) applicable to the income transfer in the rural sector is -1.16 for&#13;
n=l and -5.14 for n=2.&#13;

income in urban areas is approximately Rs. 90 compared to that of casual&#13;
laborers of Rs. 35. 2/ This is not altogether implausible since Eckert,&#13;
as noted earlier, reports that villagers consider Rs. 2 in the town equal&#13;
to Rs. I in the village. It is not clear, however, whether this reflects&#13;
urban-rural price differentials or a preference for rural life or a measure&#13;
of the risk involved in migration. To the extent that the wage differential&#13;
reflects cost of living differences, the estimates of    SWR   presented above&#13;
wR&#13;
are too high; that is, any reduction in migration will not imply such a&#13;
1/   The reason why we choose a best estimate for n=2 which is the upper&#13;
limit of the values reported in Table B-7 is explained below.&#13;

large reduction in consumption as a simple comparison of wage incomes will&#13;
suggest. 1/ More important, however, is the low level of casual labor incomes&#13;
compared to the Pakistan national average. Thus, monthly per capita income&#13;
for casual laborers is Rs. 14.4 compared to a national per capita income of&#13;
Rs. 46.1 in FY72. The transfer of income, implied by the increase in the wage&#13;
rate, to such poor members of society has a major impact on     SWR espe-&#13;
WR&#13;
cially as society's concern with income distribution increases (i.e., as n&#13;
increases). If, however, casual laborers' income has been underestimated,&#13;
the-significance of the income transfers will decrease. According to the&#13;
Household Income and Expenditure Survey of FY72 those in the bottom 10% of&#13;
the rural population had a monthly per capita income of Rs. 25.8 which sug-&#13;
gests that Eckert's estimate may be on the low side. These considerations&#13;
would lead to higher SWR   estimates.2/&#13;
wR&#13;
2.51      Many of the uncertainties in the above estimate can probably be&#13;
removed when the results of the 1977 Agricultural Economics Survey of the Indus&#13;
Basin become available. Updated and more systematically collected information&#13;
on labor incomes and labor utilization would be particularly useful. For&#13;
example, we have not estimated seasonal wage-rates. This reflects our guess&#13;
that casual laborers obtain employment throughout the year but experience&#13;
low levels of utilization. 3/ This guess may not be confirmed by the 1977&#13;
survey.&#13;
1/   This is relatively unimportant in the context of the rural SWR because&#13;
so little labor is assumed to be drawn from urban to rural employmen,t.&#13;
It does, however, assume importance in the urban SWR. See below.&#13;
2/   For this reason we chose 0.65 as our best estimate (see para 2.49) of&#13;
SWR-  for n=2 even though this equals the relevant maximum reported in&#13;
Table B-7.&#13;
3/   Mean-monthly labor utilization was 11.3 days and the range was 8.6 to&#13;
16.4 days. See J. D. Eckert, op. cit.&#13;

SWR for Unskilled Urban Labor&#13;
2.52      We present two estimates of SWR for unskilled urban labor.    The first&#13;
is for that labor which finds employment in sectors other than those covered by&#13;
the minmum wage legislation. The second is for that labor employed in the large-&#13;
scale manufacturing sector and the public sector, sectors where wages are mainly&#13;
determined by the Government.&#13;
2.53      Since the ultimate source of labor is the rural sector, our previous&#13;
estimate of the SWR for rural labor, with one important exception, serve equally&#13;
well for estimating the SWR of urban labor in sectors where wages are not con-&#13;
trolled. The exception is that the flow of labor from rural to urban areas&#13;
occasioned by an expansion in the demand for urban labor causes an increase&#13;
in total consumption equal to the urban-rural wage differential multiplied&#13;
by the proportion of migrating laborers, and does not generate any consumption&#13;
saving through reduced migration. The appropriate formula, therefore, is:&#13;
u  =   w    WR  +   0.8 (w  wu)&#13;
wu       WR   au               u&#13;
Sensitivity analysis is presented in Table B-8.&#13;
2.54      Accepting the arguments advanced in connection with SWRR (i.e.,&#13;
that E &gt; 19n and n &gt; l)we may conclude that SWR is in the range 0.70 to 0.80&#13;
wu&#13;
with a best esimate of 0.80 if n=1 and 0.75 if n=2. The qualifications noted&#13;
in the discussion of the SWRR, however, apply equally here. In particular,&#13;
is very dependent on the consumption cost of migration. If in fact the&#13;
urban-rural wage differential reflects, at least in part, price differentials&#13;
for consumption goods., the estimates presented in Table B-8 are too high. For&#13;

example, if urban prices are 25% 1/ higher than rural prices, the estimates&#13;
presented in Table B-8 must be reduced throughout by 0.12. On the other hand,&#13;
as we suggested earlier, the Eckert Survey may have produced estimates of the&#13;
urban-rural wage differential which are too high. An adjustment on this score&#13;
would tend to make `WRu more similar to SWRR . In the absence of additional&#13;
Wu                     wR&#13;
information, we assume that errors arising from a failure to allow for urban-&#13;
rural price differentials and a possible overestimate of urban-rural wage&#13;
differentials are roughly offsetting and stay with the best estimates of&#13;
0.80 for n=1 and 0.75 for n=2.&#13;
2.55      In the sectors where wages are controlled or strongly influenced by&#13;
the Government (large-scale manufacturing and public sectors) the SWR must&#13;
also include an element to allow for the increase in consumption which results&#13;
when an additional worker is engaged. That is,&#13;
SWR_     SIR    w      w-    w&#13;
wu  -    u   w   +       wu      (CCF - w*)&#13;
Wu    u         u&#13;
where the bar over the u distinguishes the urban sectors in which wages are&#13;
controlled. According to the latest Government press release, the lowest&#13;
paid workers in the public sector in Islamabad will receive wages of Rs. 385&#13;
per month in FY77. For unskilled construction labor monthly wages in Islama-&#13;
bad in FY77 were of the order of Rs. 300 to Rs. 360 per month. 2/ Setting&#13;
CCF = 0.80 and using the previously estimated values of SWi-u , the implied&#13;

ILO, 1976, p. I-II but is not supported by any evidence.&#13;
2/   Wages in Islamabad are Rs. 14 per day.   If unskilled labor obtains 22&#13;
to 26 days employment per month, monthly wage income is approximately&#13;
Rs. 300 to Rs. 360.&#13;

0.65 for n=l and 0.55 for n=2. These estimates are, of course, lower than&#13;
those for Â§Wau precisely because the wage in the public and large-scale&#13;
wu&#13;
manufacturing sector is above its market-clearing level, and the implied&#13;
income transfer is socially beneficial since the income per head of the&#13;
workers' families are below the critical consumption level.&#13;
Summary&#13;
2.56      Table B-10 contains a summary of our best estimates of SWRs rounded&#13;
to the nearest 0.05. We have commented on the limitations of the estimates&#13;
at various points in the text and have tried to make it clear which assump-&#13;
tions are of most importance for any particular estimate.&#13;
2.57      With these reservations in mind, we may summarize our conclusions&#13;
as follows. With regard to skilled and semi-skilled artisans a SWR slightly&#13;
in excess of the market wage may be appropriate as long as the current tight-&#13;
ness in the labor market continues. With regard to unskilled labor, a SWR in&#13;
the range 65% to 80% of market wages whether in the rural or urban sector&#13;
would seem to be appropriate. For the public sector, however, where the&#13;
recent wage legislation has created a distortion in the unskilled labor&#13;
market, SWRs of about 60% of the market wage appear appropriate.&#13;

GENERAL CONVERSION FACTORS FOR GOODS AND CONSUMPTION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
3.1       In this appendix we estimate the standard conversion factor (SCF),&#13;
the conversion factors (CFs) for tradables as grouped into the categories of&#13;
consumption, intermediate, and capital goods, and the consumption conversion&#13;
factor (CCF). For this purpose we shall first present a brief review of the&#13;
import and export duties and subsidies since these account for the main part&#13;
of the difference between the domestic and border prices.&#13;
3.2       The conversion factors in this paper are calculated by using two&#13;
different approaches. The first approach takes account only of the tariffs&#13;
and subsidies which were in effect during 1974-76, and omits all the other&#13;
"domestic cost elements" (e.g., trade margins, transportation, etc.) that&#13;
also contribute to the divergence of domestic prices from border prices. Our&#13;
conversion factors for commodities thus need to be supplemented by the con-&#13;
version factors for trade margins and various transportation services. Simi-&#13;
larly, non-traded goods are neglected in the calculation of the SCF. We,&#13;
however, make some crude guesses as to the required adjustments when moving&#13;
from the calculations to the best guesses (para. 3.18).&#13;
3.3       When calculating the CCF, we use, for instructive purposes, another&#13;
approach, which differs from the former on the following points: (a) Instead&#13;
of the observed rates of tariffs and subsidies, we use the rates that are&#13;
expected to hold during FY77 and FY78; (b) when calculating CFs for goods,&#13;
separate estimates are made for major commodity items within the main cate-&#13;
gories of consumer, intermediate and capital goods; (c) in the estimation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
Appendix C&#13;
Page 2&#13;
subsidies, the two approaches use different methods to net out the effect of&#13;
"domestic cost components" (cf. paras. 3.16 and 3.19), and (d) we have to be&#13;
more specific, than in the former approach, in our guesses about the shares&#13;
of distribution margins and non-tradables in the cost structure of commodi-&#13;
ties (compare para. 3.18 and paras. 3.20 and 3.21). Because of these dif-&#13;
ferences, the two approaches lead to different results for the same concepts.&#13;
As further work improves the data and fills the gaps in the coverage of the&#13;
analysis, the results of the two approaches should converge and become compar-&#13;
able.&#13;
Imports Regime 1/&#13;
3.4        The 1972 devaluation ushered in a new phase in Pakistan's balance&#13;
of payments policies. Prior to 1972 imports were restricted by tariffs and&#13;
quotas and exports were encouraged through a number of incentive schemes.&#13;
In May 1972 Pakistan devalued its currency from Rs. 4.76 to Rs. 11.0 per U.S.&#13;
dollar and switched to a much greater reliance on import tariffs and export&#13;
duties. The present rates of exchange with the U.S. dollar is approximately&#13;
Rs. 9.9 per US$1.&#13;
3.5       All imports by the private sector are subject to licenses which&#13;
are granted usually within a short period of time after the application is&#13;
lodged. Licenses for imports of a value exceeding Rs. 500 incur a fee of&#13;
up to 2% of the value of the license payable at the time of issue. Import-&#13;
able items are classified into two lists: a free list and a tied list. Items&#13;
1/   This section is based on "Pakistan: Recent Economic Development," IMF&#13;
1976; "Pakistan - Supplementary Background Material for GATT," IMF,&#13;
1977; and "Public Sector Resource Mobilization." World Bank, April&#13;

&#13;

Page 3&#13;
on the free list may be procured without restriction, while items on the tied&#13;
list may, in principle, be procured only from tied and barter trade sources.&#13;
Import items not appearing on the two lists are effectively prohibited. A&#13;
recent item-by-item check of the import categorization against the list of&#13;
permitted imports has resulted in the compilation of a rather exhaustive list&#13;
of banned items, which, it is expected, will be used to further rationalize&#13;
the system. In FY1974, 97.1% of the c.i.f. value of imports was comprised of&#13;
items on the free list. The present tendency is to reduce items on the tied&#13;
list, as well as to reduce the number of banned items. 1/ Imported commodities&#13;
are subject to two different types of taxation - import duties proper and sales&#13;
tax. In addition, some of the major consumer items (for example, wheat) are&#13;
subsidized.&#13;
Import Duties&#13;
3.6       A breakdown of import duties by commodity group is shown in Table&#13;
C-i. For both FY74 and FY75 the incidence of import duties is least for con-&#13;
sumer goods, greater for raw materials for consumer goods, still greater for&#13;
raw materials for capital goods, and is heaviest for capital goods. The low&#13;
rates of incidence for consumer goods and raw materials for consumer goods&#13;
reflect the importance of duty-free items such as wheat, edible oil, ferti-&#13;
lizer, and POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants). These four items accounted&#13;
for approximately one-third of total imports in FY74 and FY75 and almost 90%&#13;
and 80% of duty-free imports in FY74 and FY75, respectively. Overall inci-&#13;
dence of duties was 16% in FY74 and 18% in FY75.&#13;
1/   The banned items are not produced in Pakistan, i.e., the ban is for&#13;
social reasons and not for protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
Appendix C&#13;
Page 4&#13;
3.7       During FY75 and FY76 duty rates were increased and new duties&#13;
imposed on a number of items (e.g., automobiles, synthetic fibres, consumer&#13;
durable, pig iron, iron and steel scrap, iron and steel products). More&#13;
recently, in July 1976 an additional 10% duty was levied on all dutiable&#13;
imports other than POL products, tea, machinery, tractors, and second-hand&#13;
garments. As a result, roughly one third of imports (mainly wheat, edible&#13;
oil, fertilizer, POL and imports for the steel mill and fertilizer factories)&#13;
remained exempt from duty. Another one third of imports (POL products, tea,&#13;
machinery, tractors and second-hand garments) bears an average incidence of&#13;
33%, and the rest 43%. Compared to the overall incidence rates for FY74 and&#13;
FY75 of 16% and 18% respectively, the incidence is 22% in FY76 and 25% in&#13;
FY77. Finally, new measures announced in the budget include a 20% increase&#13;
in import duties for FY78.&#13;
3.8       The recent changes described above have been used to make projec-&#13;
tions of tariff incidence for FY77 and FY78 in Table C-2. The weights are&#13;
based on FY75 import data and the tariff rates are drawn from the preceding&#13;
discussion. The overall incidence for FY77 is 26% compared to the figure&#13;
of 25% cited above. The overall incidence rises to 31% in FY78.&#13;
Sales Tax&#13;
3.9        Although initially designed as a general tax, sales tax is now&#13;
essentially a surcharge on the "duty-paid" value of selected imports; three-&#13;
fourths of sales tax receipts are now derived from imports. It is also levied&#13;
as a selective production tax on some domestic manufacturers when goods are&#13;
released by producers or wholz alers for retail sale.     The standard rate of&#13;
sales tax since FY1974 is 20% bu.. semi-necessities are taxed at lower rates&#13;

ranging from 7.5 to 15% and luxuries are taxed at 25 to 30%. Certain imported&#13;
goods (mostly raw materials) are taxed at the reduced rate of 10%. As a per-&#13;
centage of the c.i.f. value of imports, sales tax was 3.5Z in FY74, 3.6% in&#13;
FY75 and 4.0% in FY76.&#13;
Import Subsidies&#13;
3.10      The international inflation of recent years raised import prices of&#13;
wheat, vegetable ghee, and sugar, several-fold. The Government, however,&#13;
refrained from adjusting domestic prices of food and agricultural inputs for&#13;
a while so that subsidies rose sharply during FY74 and FY75. Table C-3 shows&#13;
the importance of the major import subsidies during the period of very rapid&#13;
increases in world prices. Towards the end of FY75, subsidies on sugar and&#13;
vegetable ghee were eliminated and the wheat subsidy was reduced. Neverthe-&#13;
less, subsidies (mainly on wheat) remain about 10% of nondevelopment revenue&#13;
expenditures, the current issue price of wheat being only a little over half&#13;
the cost of imported wheat. For FY77 and FY78 subsidies shown under nondevel-&#13;
opment revenue expenditures (mainly for wheat) are estimated to be Rs. 594&#13;
million and Rs. 584 million respectively. Direct price comparisons reveal&#13;
that the subsidy is around 40% of the c.i.f. price for FY77 and FY78. 1/ The&#13;
fertilizer subsidy in FY77 is estimated to be Rs. 370 million, resulting in&#13;
a subsidy of around 30% on the estimated import value of $125 million.&#13;

Export Duties&#13;
3.11       Some of the major exports (rice, cotton) are handled by the Govern-&#13;
ment. Exports of rice are subject to state trading under the control of the&#13;
Rice Export Corporation, and exports of raw cotton are handled by the Cotton&#13;
Export Corporation. Other exports (except cement) are allowed freely. Export&#13;
duties are levied on a range of items, including raw cotton, rice, oil cakes,&#13;
and hides and skins. The rate of income tax and corporate profit tax is&#13;
reduced by 50% on all income and profits derived from exports, except on raw&#13;
cotton and certain other goods.&#13;
3.12      Table C-4 shows the incidence of export duties by major exports.&#13;
Over 80% in FY74 and 90% in FY75 of total export duty revenue was derived&#13;
from cotton and rice. As international commodity prices began falling in&#13;
FY1975 and 1976 most export duties were reduced or eliminated.     Some of the&#13;

a/   There is no parallelism between the year-to-year changes in import values&#13;
and that in subsidies because of lack of correspondence between the&#13;
changes in domestic prices and that in import unit costs and also because&#13;
of varying stock levels from one year to the next. In the case of ferti-&#13;
lizer, the subsidy shown is for the total consumption, almost two-thirds&#13;
of which come from domestic production; this is an additional reasoiL for&#13;
the lack of correspondence between yearly values of imports and subsidies.&#13;

main revenue-earners in previous years, i.e., cotton yarn, cloth and "desi"&#13;
variety of raw cottonl, are now exported duty-free, and the duty on staple raw&#13;
cotton has been reduced to 25% and on semi-tanned leather to 15%. In the&#13;
case of staple raw cptton and rice, whieh now provide the bulk of export&#13;
duties, the Government nationalized the export trade in FY74. Since the&#13;
Government also sets the procurement prices for these commodities, export&#13;
taxes as a means of raising revenue have become superfluous; the surplus of&#13;
revenue over procurement and handling costs in any case accrues to the Govern-&#13;
ment as trading profits.&#13;
3.13      The major current export duties are as follows:    raw cotton (other&#13;
than desi cotton) is taxed at 25%; rice (Basmati) at Rs. 34.00 per cwt and&#13;
other rice at 30%; 1/ hides (raw) at 40%; oil cakes at 40%; semi-tanned and&#13;
tanned hides and skins at 20%; oil cakes at 45%; and molasses at-30%. 2/&#13;
3.14      In addition, Pakistan offers several ingentives to producers of&#13;
manufactured exports.   Import duties and sales tax paid on imported raw mate-&#13;
rials are refundable if the taxed materials are used in the production of&#13;
exported goods. Rebates of excise duties and sales tax on domestically&#13;
produced goods used in the production of exports are also allowed. However,&#13;
less than 2% of import duty and sales tax collections have been rebated on&#13;
average, and even if they had been fully rebated on manufactured exports this&#13;
would amount to less than 1% of the vlaue of manufactured exports. In the&#13;
case of excise duties, the experience has been somewhat different. Admin-&#13;
istrative regulations permit manufacturer-exporters to export directly without&#13;
1/   The FY77 f.o.b. price of Basmati rice is $350 per ton, so that the Rs.&#13;
34 per cwt duty translates into a 20% ad valorem duty.&#13;
2/   Duties are levied ad valorem, that is, as a percentage of the f.o.b.&#13;
values of imports.&#13;

payment of excise duty, and to use inputs from within the factory for the&#13;
production of exports without paying excise duty. This concession, however,&#13;
is not available when inputs are purchased domestically or when products&#13;
containing excisable inputs are exported by someone other than the manufac-&#13;
turer. In such instances, the normal rebate procedures apply, and this has&#13;
been no more efficient than in the case of import duties and sales tax&#13;
rebates. Refunds amounted to less than 1% of gross collections in FY76.&#13;
And since a large part of the "new" manufactured exports are produced within&#13;
the small-scale sector and are exported primarily by commercial exporters,&#13;
it is reasonable to assume that most exports do not benefit significantly&#13;
from these incentives.&#13;

Conversion Factors for Goods&#13;
3.15      We shall calculate the standard conversion factor (SCF) and conver-&#13;
sion factors for tradables as grouped into the categories of consumption,&#13;
intermediate, and capital goods. The standard conversion factor may be use-&#13;
ful in converting to border prices the value of minor non-traded costs and&#13;
benefits and the prices of goods which cannot be revalued at border prices&#13;
because of constraints on data, time, etc. We shall make the usual set of&#13;
simplifying assumptions 1/ and use the following formula for the calculation&#13;
of the standard as well as the specific conversion factors. 2/&#13;
M + X&#13;
B-&#13;
M + T + X-T&#13;
in     x&#13;
where M is imports; X is exports; and T and T    are net taxes on imports and&#13;
exports, respectively.&#13;
3.16      Table C-5 gives the yearly values of the necessary data to calculate&#13;
the SCF for the fiscal years 1974, 1975 and 1976. We also calculated the SCF&#13;
by using the three years' averages of trade and tax data. Taxes on imports&#13;
include import duties and sales tax on imported goods but excludes the license&#13;
1/   The assumptions are as follows:   (a) export demand and import supply are&#13;
infinitely elastic; (b) marginal changes in expenditure on non-tradables&#13;
can be neglected; (c) all income elasticities of spending are unit or the&#13;
relative size of the average propensities to spend on importables and on&#13;
exportables are approximately reflected by the relative size of imports&#13;
and exports, and (d) the existing extent and degree of protection is not&#13;
likely to change significantly.&#13;
2/   Mr. M.Z. Khan has recently used a more elaborate version of this formula&#13;
which incorporated the price elasticities of supply and demand of exports&#13;
and estimated that the shadow exchange rate was equal to .948 times the&#13;
official exchange rate. This result is almost identical with our SCF&#13;
shown in Table C-5 here. (MoZo Khan, Estimation of the Shadow Exchange&#13;
Rate for Pakistan, the draft distributed on 12/23/77),&#13;

fees of up to 2% of the value of imported because of the lack of data and&#13;
their relatively small size. Import subsidies comprise those for wheat,&#13;
fertilizer and edible oil (there was a subsidy on edible oil imports only in&#13;
1973/74 and 1974/75). To calculate subsidies on a similar basis to tariff&#13;
revenue, the unit subsidy should be expressed as the difference between the&#13;
unit import cost and the ration shop price, multipled by the import volume of&#13;
the commodity in question. 1/ The available data, however, allowed this&#13;
approach to be used only for the calculation of the wheat import subsidy; for&#13;
edible oil and fertilizer 2/ subsidies we took the actual amounts given in the&#13;
Government accounts.&#13;
3.17      The data we have show the breakdown of imports by the three main&#13;
categories of goods. Exports data are available by major commodities, includ-&#13;
ing a large item of "Others". We took cement as the only exported capital good&#13;
and brought cotton (raw, yarn and cloth), raw wool and tanned leather exports&#13;
together under intermediate goods exports; the rest we treated as consumer&#13;
goods exports. Obviously, a more detailed commodity breakdown of exports is&#13;
required to obtain more reliable estimates of the conversion factors. Simi-&#13;
larly, the information on the incidence of import taxes by the three major&#13;
1/   We adopt this approach instead of taking the full amount of subsidy on&#13;
particular import goods. The reason for this is that the subsidy amount&#13;
in the Government budget shows the difference between the sale revenue&#13;
and total cost of supplying the particular good, which may includ( trans-&#13;
portation and other domestic costs as well as the trade margins of various&#13;
government agencies and private traders. The approach taken here implies&#13;
that only that part of the unit subsidy which is above the domestic cost&#13;
component of the unit cost is regarded as a subsidy towards the import&#13;
cost of the g-ood in question.&#13;
2/   Because of the data constraint, we could not ascertain what part, if any,&#13;
of the fertilizer subsidy was arising from the consumption of domestically&#13;
produced fertilizer.&#13;

3.18      We thus obtained, in Tables C-5 through C-8, the SCF as well as&#13;
the CFs for capital, intermediate and consumer goods. The conversion factors&#13;
for consumer and intermediate goods probably slightly overstate the true&#13;
figures since trade margins have been excluded, and their conversion factors&#13;
are likely to be lower than unit value. Using 1975/76 estimates, and making&#13;
a rough allowance for trade margins, we suggest the following conversion&#13;
factors for goods.&#13;

The estimate fqr the SCF still makes no allowance for non-tradables other&#13;
than trading margins.   We have pn infor4ation concerning the cost of non-&#13;
tradables.   Put it is very likely that the SCF would be further reduced by&#13;
their inclusion.   We h,ve therefore used elsewhere in this paper a roun,ded&#13;
figure for the SCF of 85,&#13;

Consumption Conversion Factor&#13;
3.19      In this section we derived a general conversion factor for consump-&#13;
tion. For this purpose we use the conversion factors for particular import-&#13;
ables and exportables estimated in Tables C-9 and C-1O.   For these estimates&#13;
we used the tariff and subsidy rates calculated for FY77 and FY78 (see Table&#13;
C-2 and para. 3.10 above).   The calculation assumes that the domestic price&#13;
of imports at the dockside (Karachi) equals the c.i.f. price plus tariff.    To&#13;
obtain the conversion factor at any other location, appropriate allowance&#13;
would have to be made for transport and other costs associated with wholesal-&#13;
ing and retailing. In the case of government subsidized commodities (wheat&#13;
and fertilizer), however, the estimation of the tariff rate (negative) already&#13;
includes an element of distribution costs, since the government handles distri-&#13;
bution itself. Two alternative assumptions are used in order to net out the&#13;
distribution margin. Since imported wheat is presumably milled in or around&#13;
Karachi we experiment with port-to-mill margins of'5% and 10% of the c.i.f.&#13;
price. For fertilizer, which is presumably distributed throughout the country&#13;
through government outlets, we experiment with margins of 10% and 15%. A&#13;
similar approach is used for exportables. As such the resulting conversion&#13;
factor allows only for export duties; no allowance is made for transport and&#13;
other trade margins.&#13;
3.20      The allocation of consumer expenditure for urban and rural households&#13;
is shown in Table C-llo A further breakdown by income class is also possible&#13;
but, since inspection revealed that income elasticities were not greatly dif-&#13;
ferent from unity, this refinement was not pursued. In Table C-12 we have&#13;
removed the unspecified category by assuming that the conversion factor for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
Appendix C&#13;
Page 20&#13;
unspecified consumption is the same as that for specified consumption, and&#13;
we have made an allowance for trade margins. In particular, we assume that&#13;
30% of the price of wheat represents transport, milling and other distribu-&#13;
tion costs, and that a 20% mark-up is appropriate for all other tradables.&#13;
3.21      No information is available on the cost structure of consumer ser-&#13;
vices and distribution. We have, therefore, assumed that on average non-&#13;
tradables entering consumption comprise 5% taxes, 35% labor, 10% POL, 25%&#13;
other raw materials and 25% capital goods. 1/ This allocation is reflected&#13;
in the weights reproduced in Table C-13. Taking the conversion factor for&#13;
labor as 0.7 (see Appendix B), the resulting consumption conversion factor&#13;
is 0.78 for urban households and 0.82 for rural households. 2/ A national&#13;
consumption conversion factor may be derived by weighting the urban and&#13;
rural conversion factors by their respective consumption shares. This pro-&#13;
cedure yields a national consumption conversion factor of 0.81, which we&#13;
round to 0.80. Given the similarity of the CCF for different groups, through-&#13;
out the paper we used 0.80 for all groups.&#13;
1/   These proportions are based loosely on other studies of this kind in&#13;
different countries. They should obviously be revised if additional&#13;
data are forthcoming.&#13;
2/   The weights are 0.66 for rural consumption and 0.34 for urban consump-&#13;
tion and were obtained on the basis of information on the urban-rural&#13;
distribution of population ("Towards an Employment Strategy in Pakistan,"&#13;
ILO, 1976), and on household consumption expenditure (Household Income&#13;
and Expenditure Survey, FY72, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Develop-&#13;
ment, Pakistan, 1973).&#13;

            Application of shadow pricing to country
            economic analysis with an illustration from Pakistan
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper demonstrates the role of
            shadow pricing in country economic analysis. It is argued
            that: first, shadow prices serve as summary measures which
            help the country economist to channel the substance of a
            variety of otherwise disparate and unlinked sector studies
            into subsequent policy analysis; and second, a number of
            issues commonly discussed in country economic reports are
            shown to be amenable to analysis by the techniques of shadow
            pricing more usually associated with project evaluation.
            This latter point is the main topic of a variety of examples
            from Pakistan which involve the analysis of such diverse
            policy issues as the optimal level of foreign borrowing, the
            net social benefit of emigration, the social worth of
            subsidizing wheat and the social value of increasing public
            sector salaries. In order to analyze these issues and make
            the main point of the paper, it is, of course, necessary to
            estimate certain shadow prices. It is stressed, however,
            that while every attempt has been made to make the estimates
            as accurate as possible, in this respect the contribution
            remains no more than an initial desk study in which the
            primary purpose was to demonstrate the use of shadow prices
            in country economic work rather than to estimate the shadow
            prices themselves.
