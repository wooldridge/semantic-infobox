            Optimal size for utilities?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Using data from 270 water and sanitation
            providers, this Note investigates the relationship between a
            utility's size and its operating costs. The current
            trend toward transferring responsibility for providing
            services to the municipal level is driven in part by the
            assumption that this will make providers more responsive to
            customers' needs. But findings reported here suggest
            that smaller municipalities may face higher per-customer
            costs and could lower costs (and prices for consumers) by merging.
