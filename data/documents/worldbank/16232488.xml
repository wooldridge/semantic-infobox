The Government of Bangladesh has already shown it is highly committed&#13;
to these goals through its national â&#128;&#152;Sanitation for All by 2013â&#128;&#153; campaign,&#13;
under which there has been increasing budgetary allocations for sanitation&#13;
(hygienic/improved latrines): BDT 4,080 million in ï¬?nancial year 2006â&#128;&#147;07,&#13;
BDT 5,510 million in 2007â&#128;&#147;08, and BDT 6,370 million in 2008â&#128;&#147;09.&#13;
&#13;
How does Better Sanitation Move Bangladesh&#13;
Society Forward?&#13;
Good sanitation and hygiene practices make major differences in&#13;
health, education, and socioeconomic development. They increase life&#13;
expectancy and reduce morbidity, in turn leading to other beneï¬?ts such&#13;
as decreased healthcare costs, increased worker productivity, higher&#13;
school attendance, reduced water treatment costs, and more (Figure&#13;
1). Their impact on girls and women is especially large: lack of latrines&#13;
in households makes women vulnerable to harassment and assault,&#13;
particularly at night, and many girls and women drop out of schools and&#13;
miss work due to inadequate sanitation facilities.4&#13;
&#13;
What is the Status of Sanitation in Bangladesh Today?&#13;
According to the Joint Monitoring Program of the World Health&#13;
Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;s sanitation coverage&#13;
rose from 20 percent in 1990 to 39 percent in 2004 and 53 percent in&#13;

Data sources:7 National data on incidence or actual numbers for the indicators under the three broad impact components&#13;
were compiled from the following data sources: Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2007, Health Bulletin (2008),&#13;
WHOâ&#128;&#153;s Global Burden of Disease (2004), Household Income and Expenditure Survey (2005), Sample Vital Registration&#13;
System (2007), Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) (2006), Population Census (2001), National Accounts and&#13;
GDP (2007), Labor Force Survey (2005-06), and Statistical Yearbook (2007). Based on the review of relevant scientiï¬?c&#13;
literature, attribution factors were used to estimate the populations impacted by inadequate sanitation and, ï¬?nally, the&#13;
economic valuation was done using costs/prices based on other secondary sources. Conservative assumptions have been&#13;
used in economic valuation and the pertinent analysis has been carried out for 2007 for want of comprehensive data for&#13;
later years.&#13;

  The poorest 40 percent of households are those in the lowest two wealth quintiles. In Bangladesh, the poverty ratio based on the direct calorie intake method was 40&#13;
percent in 2007. In estimating the poor householdâ&#128;&#153;s share in the total losses due to inadequate sanitation, the poor/non-poor ratio of diarrheal morbidity (2.73) and that&#13;
for ALRI (common cold, URI, acute cough, bronchitis; 2.04) were considered in weighted form. Source: Barkat Abul. â&#128;&#152;Political Economy of Health Care in Bangladeshâ&#128;&#153;,&#13;

What can Bangladesh Gain by Improving Sanitation?&#13;
This study estimates that a package of comprehensive sanitation and&#13;
hygiene interventions can result in preventing 61 percent of the economic&#13;
loss due to health impacts linked with sanitation and all the adverse&#13;
impacts of inadequate sanitation related to water and welfare losses.&#13;
Such a comprehensive package would need to address increased use&#13;
of sanitary toilets, hygiene promotion (including hand washing and safe&#13;
water management), safe disposal of human excreta, and improved&#13;
access to safe water.&#13;

WSP is a multi-donor partnership created in 1978 and administered by the World Bank to support poor people&#13;
in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSP provides technical&#13;
assistance, facilitates knowledge exchange, and promotes evidence-based advancements in sector dialog. WSP has&#13;
ofï¬?ces in 25 countries across Africa, East Asia and the Paciï¬?c, Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and in&#13;
Washington, DC. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s donors include Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill and Melinda&#13;

 Economics of Sanitation&#13;
The Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) is a multi-country initiative of the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP).&#13;
ESI was launched in 2007 as a response by the Water and Sanitation Program (www.wsp.org) to address major&#13;
gaps in evidence among developing countries on the economic aspects of sanitation. The study aims to provide&#13;
evidence that supports sanitation advocacy, elevates the proï¬?le of sanitation, and acts as an effective tool to convince&#13;
governments to take action. The ï¬?rst study completed in Southeast Asia found that the economic costs of poor&#13;
sanitation and hygiene amounted to over US$9.2 billion a year (2005 prices) in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR,&#13;
the Philippines, and Vietnam. Its second phase analyzes the cost-beneï¬?t of alternative sanitation interventions and&#13;
will enable stakeholders to make decisions on how to spend funds allocated to sanitation more efï¬?ciently. Due to that&#13;
studyâ&#128;&#153;s successful traction, WSP has now carried out ESI studies in India and Pakistan as well as the Bangladesh&#13;
study summarized here. ESI studies are also planned for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&#13;

            Inadequate sanitation costs Bangladesh

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The economic impact of inadequate
            sanitation in Bangladesh finds that substantial economic
            losses are incurred ever year in Bangladesh as a result of
            inadequate sanitation. While the Government of Bangladesh
            has made significant investments to achieve its
            'sanitation for all by 2013' goals, much work
            remains to be done. The study's estimation of economic
            losses shows that inadequate sanitation has serious
            implications for Bangladesh's overall socioeconomic and
            cultural development. Its findings are also highly
            encouraging in the measurable gains that sanitation and
            hygiene interventions could achieve by reducing premature
            deaths and related morbidity, eliminating domestic
            water-related costs, reducing absentee time at schools and
            workplaces, and improving welfare and productivity.
            Therefore, to derive maximum benefits from sanitation, the
            study recommends the following: a) increase investment in
            sanitation; b) increase investment in hygiene interventions;
            c) launch vigorous communication campaign; and d) devise an
            appropriate monitoring framework.
