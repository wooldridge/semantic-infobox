Dear Mrs. Glad:&#13;
1.    We are pleased to acknowledge on behalf of the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development ("IBRD") and the International Development Association ("IDA")&#13;
(collectively, the "Bank") that the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the&#13;
"Donor") has agreed to make available as a grant, subject to Parliamentary appropriations, the&#13;
sum not exceeding six million Norwegian Kroner (NOK 6,000,000) (the "Contribution") for&#13;
the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Program ("PEFA"), Phase IV Multi-&#13;
Donor Trust Fund (the "Trust Fund") in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for the&#13;
period 2013-2015. Other donors are also expected to contribute to the Trust Fund on the&#13;
terms and conditions specified in the Annexes to this Agreement.&#13;
2.    The Contribution shall be used to finance the activities and the categories of&#13;
expenditure set forth in the "Description of Activities, Expenditures and Governance&#13;
Arrangements under the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Program, Phase IV&#13;
Multi-Donor Trust Fund" attached hereto as Annex 1, and shall be administered by the Bank&#13;
on behalf of the Donor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement including the&#13;
"Standard Provisions Applicable to the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability&#13;

Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-2-&#13;
3.    The Donor shall deposit the Contribution into such bank account designated by the&#13;
Bank in installments based on the financial needs of the Trust Fund and in accordance with&#13;
the following schedule:&#13;
(a)   promptly following countersignature of this Agreement by the Donor and upon&#13;
submission of a payment request by the Bank, two million Norwegian Kroner&#13;
(NOK 2,000,000);&#13;
(b)   on or before March 1, 2014 and upon submission of a payment request by the&#13;

If the speed of the implementation of the activities to be financed by the Trust Fund&#13;
makes it necessary to either bring payments forward or to delay them, changes in the above&#13;
schedule will be agreed by the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
4.    When making each such deposit, the Donor shall instruct its bank to include in its&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
Description of Activities, Expenditures and Governance Arrangements under the Public&#13;
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Program, Phase IV&#13;
Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements entered&#13;
into between the Bank and entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide contributions (the&#13;
aggregate of all contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to be administered by the&#13;
Bank for the Trust Fund.&#13;
A.    DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
1.    Purpose and Objective&#13;
The strengthening of public expenditure, procurement and financial accountability systems is&#13;
a key element in the efforts towards the promotion of economic development, poverty&#13;
reduction and good governance. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability&#13;
Program ("PEFA Program") was established in December, 2001 to support the development&#13;
of integrated and coordinated approaches to assessment and reform in the field of public&#13;
expenditure, procurement and financial accountability, with the particular goals to:&#13;
(a)   develop an approach to improve public financial management ("PFM") system&#13;
reform outcomes and learn lessons of successful and unsuccessful PFM&#13;
reforms; and&#13;
(b)   reduce transaction costs to countries from  duplicative and overlapping&#13;
diagnostics while ensuring that the information needs of donors can still be&#13;
met.&#13;
Following the development of the PFM Performance Measurement Framework (the "PFM&#13;
Framework") and the Strengthened Approach to supporting PFM reform (the "Strengthened&#13;
Approach") during the first four years (under the PEFA Program, Phase I), the PEFA Program&#13;
has, during Phases II and III aimed to monitor and provide technical support on the&#13;
application of the PFM Framework, to provide a common information pool on PFM systems&#13;
based on completed PEFA Program assessments, to fine-tune the PFM Framework and to&#13;
support dissemination, training and lesson learning on the PFM Framework and the&#13;
Strengthened Approach, in order to meet its goals. Phase IV of the PEFA Program will&#13;
continue to support these activities while expanding its focus on the use of assessments for&#13;
multiple purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-&#13;
The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Program, Phase IV Multi-Donor Trust&#13;
Fund supports the strengthening of partnerships between development agencies that&#13;
contribute to the achievements of the goals of the PEFA Program mentioned above. The&#13;
Trust Fund's global, intermediate and direct objectives are as follows:&#13;
(a)   to improve PFM system performance for strengthened economic growth and&#13;
government service delivery (global objective);&#13;
(b)   to have PEFA assessments used for PFM reform formulation, donor support&#13;
decisions and research (intermediate objective); and&#13;
(c)   to expand and update the global, common and credible information pool on&#13;
PFM systems performance (direct objective).&#13;
2.    Eligible Activities&#13;
The Trust Fund will finance the activities set forth in Section V.4 of the Program Document&#13;
for the PEFA Program, Phase IV (2012-2017) approved by the Steering Committee of the&#13;
PEFA Program on April 25, 2012 (the "Program Document"), as amended from time to time&#13;
by decision of the Steering Committee in accordance with the Governance Arrangements (as&#13;
defined below) (the "Eligible Activities").&#13;
B.    CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURE&#13;

approved by the Steering Committee.&#13;
The foregoing categories of expenditures may include the financing of taxes.&#13;
&#13;

C.    GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
The "Program Governance Arrangements" set forth in Section VI of the Program Document,&#13;
as amended from time to time by decision of the Steering Committee, shall apply to the Trust&#13;
Fund (the "Governance Arrangements").&#13;
