Capacity Building and Diagnostics The World Bank&#13;
Institute (WBI) helps policy makers from client countries&#13;
develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities that will enable&#13;
them to improve governance and stem corruption. In&#13;
cooperation with the Bank's lending program and partner&#13;
institutions, the Institute delivers participatory learning&#13;
programs that help local government leaders formulate&#13;
specific institutional reforms. In fiscal 2005 WBI helped&#13;
civil society organizations from Benin, Guatemala, Guinea,&#13;
Sierra Leone, and Zambia to develop governance and&#13;
anticorruption assessments.&#13;
   WBI and the Bank's Development Economics Group&#13;
produce the Worldwide Governance Indicators, which assess&#13;
more than 200 countries and territories on key dimensions&#13;
of governance.These indicators are widely used by policy&#13;
makers, donor agencies, and social science researchers.&#13;

Tackling Risks and Uncertainties Affecting Developing&#13;
Countries&#13;
Poor countries face risks and vulnerabilities that stand&#13;
in the way of sustainable development.Water insecurity,&#13;
commodity price volatility, extreme weather variability,&#13;
and natural disasters affect growth prospects. Ecological&#13;
risks--caused by climate change, biodiversity loss, depletion&#13;
of fisheries stock, and unsustainable practices such as illegal&#13;
logging--threaten the availability of natural resources for&#13;
productive purposes and wealth creation. Social imbalances,&#13;
weak institutions, and political instability lead to conflicts,&#13;
which deter development efforts.&#13;
   The Bank is addressing these issues with a suite of&#13;
interrelated sector strategies on agriculture and rural&#13;

these development and poverty reduction issues. A review of&#13;

global level than at the country level. But linkages between&#13;
global programs and the Bank's country operations are weak.&#13;
   A joint evaluation with the IMF's Independent Evaluation&#13;
Office found that the poverty reduction strategy process has&#13;
helped focus stakeholders in low-income countries on poverty,&#13;
results, and an overarching framework for aid management.&#13;

   The Bank's strategy for assisting Africa is outlined in        ment of the African Institutes for Science and Technology,&#13;
the Strategic Framework for IDA's Assistance to Africa,           which seek to increase scientific and technical achievement&#13;
which draws on the report Can Africa Claim the 21st               through regional approaches.&#13;
Century? The framework focuses on reducing conflict,&#13;
improving governance, increasing economic growth, enhancing       INCREASING ECONOMIC GROWTH,COMPETITIVENESS,&#13;
competitiveness and trade, and improving aid effectiveness.       AND TRADE&#13;
The strategy is complemented by a vision of "hopeful real-        Fifteen African countries averaged economic growth of 5&#13;
ism" about Africa's capacity to reduce poverty.This vision        percent a year over the past decade, but their success was not&#13;
focuses on five areas: developing the private sector, increasing  enough to offset the continuing drop in Africa's share of world&#13;
regional integration, building capacity, doubling aid flows,      trade.Trade expansion requires strengthening the agriculture&#13;
and increasing Africa's share of world trade.                     sector, which employs 70 percent of Africa's labor force and&#13;

Africa's huge infrastructure needs. More than 200 policy&#13;

representatives attended.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
REDUCING CONFLICT&#13;
Conflict is estimated to cost affected African countries 2.2&#13;
percentage points of economic growth each year. In collabora-&#13;
tion with NEPAD, the Bank is working to achieve peace and&#13;
stability.These conditions are needed if countries in the region&#13;
are to attract foreign investment and increase their exports.&#13;
    In fiscal 2005 the Bank provided assistance to 17 conflict-&#13;
affected countries and low-income countries under stress (see&#13;
chapter 3). It also worked to increase transparency and reduce&#13;
incentives for illegal trade in commodities linked to conflict,&#13;
such as oil, gas, diamonds, timber, and precious metals.&#13;
   A key objective of NEPAD is to help build capable and&#13;
effective states that provide basic services, promote equity and&#13;
security, and create an enabling environment for investment,&#13;
wealth creation, and wealth sharing, particularly through the&#13;
peer review mechanism. In support of this objective, the Bank&#13;
directs more than 20 percent of its new lending toward public&#13;
sector governance. Interventions cover expenditure manage-&#13;
ment, civil service reform, decentralization, accountability&#13;
mechanisms, and legal and judicial reform.&#13;

BUILDING THE CLIMATE FOR INVESTMENT&#13;
Across the region the Bank is assisting countries in their&#13;
efforts to reduce the red tape that hinders private sector&#13;
development and to address the poor logistics that make&#13;
products costly and businesses unprofitable. Major financing&#13;
to the region in fiscal 2005 included a $658 million loan to&#13;
Brazil for programmatic fiscal reform and social security&#13;
reform; a $250 million loan to Mexico to support innovation&#13;

   To help identify priorities for public expenditure&#13;
reform, the Bank carried out public expenditure reviews of&#13;
Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, St. Lucia, St.Vincent and&#13;
the Grenadines, and Uruguay in fiscal 2005. It completed&#13;
investment climate surveys for Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador,&#13;
and Guatemala and launched surveys for Costa Rica and&#13;
Jamaica.The results of the survey for El Salvador were used&#13;
to design the first development policy loan for the country&#13;
and provide benchmarks for monitoring and evaluating the&#13;
loan.The Bank conducted other analytic work on growth&#13;

     region's rural activities to national development is twice as large&#13;

     problems has been underestimated.The implication: the countries&#13;

   The two most prominent themes were human development&#13;
and rural development, accounting for 19 and 17 percent&#13;
of IDA commitments, respectively. Major attention was also&#13;
paid to financial and private sector development (16 percent),&#13;
public sector governance (16 percent), and social protection&#13;
and risk management (8 percent). Figures 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6&#13;
show IDA commitments by region, theme, and sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IDA Resources&#13;
IDA is financed by its own resources and by donor govern-&#13;
ments. Every three years donor governments and representa-&#13;
tives of borrower countries meet to discuss IDA's policies&#13;
and priorities and to agree on the amount of new resources&#13;
required to fund IDA's lending program. Historically, the&#13;
major industrial nations have been the largest contributors&#13;
to IDA. Donor nations also include developing countries and&#13;
transition economies--some of them current IBRD borrowers&#13;
and former IDA borrowers.&#13;
   Negotiations for the 14th Replenishment of IDA (IDA14)&#13;
concluded in February 2005.The IDA14 agreement, which&#13;
governs the use of IDA resources for fiscal years 2006-8,&#13;
provides 24.2 billion in special drawing rights (SDRs)(about&#13;
$35.3 billion).This amount includes SDR14.1 billion (about&#13;
$20.7 billion) in new donor contributions; SDR8.7 billion&#13;
(about $12.7 billion) in internal resources, including repay-&#13;
ments of principal from past credits and investment income;&#13;
and SDR1.1 billion (about $1.5 billion) in IBRD net income&#13;
transfers, subject to approval by IDA's Board of Governors.&#13;
Donor countries made firm financial commitments to the&#13;
replenishment, but some are still exploring the possibility of&#13;
increasing pledges to reach the 30 percent target increase in&#13;
commitment authority supported by IDA donors. (See figure&#13;
3.7 for the sources of IDA funding, and figure 3.8 for IDA's&#13;
impact on social sector efforts.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Low-Income Countries under Stress&#13;
Effective engagement with low-income countries under stress&#13;
(LICUS) is essential for long-term development and global&#13;
security.Work continued this year on increasing the effective-&#13;
ness of aid, with the Bank providing close oversight of progress&#13;
in the 25 most fragile states. Heightened operational readi-&#13;
ness and close partnerships with other donors allowed fast&#13;
and flexible support in postconflict countries such as Haiti,&#13;
Liberia, and Sudan.To improve links between security and&#13;
development, the Bank and the United Nations Development&#13;
Group developed the Transitional Results Matrix, a planning&#13;
tool that helps countries prioritize and enhance the coherence&#13;
of international support across political, security, economic,&#13;
development, and humanitarian arenas.&#13;

                                             The Bank implemented several institutional reforms to&#13;

                                          countries meet the MDGs.&#13;
                                             Under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)&#13;
                                          Initiative (www.worldbank.org/debt), 27 countries are now&#13;
                                          receiving debt relief that is expected to total more than&#13;
                                          $54 billion over time. Eighteen countries have reached the&#13;
                                          "completion point," where debt relief becomes irrevocable.&#13;
                                          In fiscal 2005 the boards of the Bank and the International&#13;
                                          Monetary Fund voted to extend the HIPC Initiative through&#13;
                                          December 31, 2006. Unlike previous extensions, this one&#13;
                                          applies only to countries that satisfied HIPC income and&#13;
                                          indebtedness criteria as of the end of 2004.&#13;
                                             The debt relief program has significantly reduced debt stock&#13;
                                          in HIPCs (see figure 3.9) and has allowed poverty-reducing&#13;
                                          spending in those countries to rise (figure 3.10).&#13;
                                             Together with the International Monetary Fund, the Bank&#13;
                                          has developed a framework for assessing debt sustainability&#13;
                                          in low-income countries that will guide lending decisions in a&#13;
                                          way that balances a country's need for funds with its ability&#13;
                                          to service debt, and in a manner tailored to the country's&#13;
                                          circumstances.The framework reflects feedback from exten-&#13;

productive employment; reducing poverty and inequality;&#13;
reducing volatility, particularly in their access to private&#13;
financial markets; and strengthening the institutional and&#13;
governance structures that underpin viable market-based&#13;
economies.The Bank is uniquely placed to help these countries&#13;
craft institutional reforms, attract infrastructure investment&#13;
across the public-private spectrum, improve social service&#13;
delivery, and cope with volatility.&#13;
   To support the development efforts of middle-income&#13;
countries, the Bank began implementing an action plan in&#13;
fiscal 2005 designed to strengthen the ability of its staff&#13;
to respond to these countries' borrowing needs. Initiatives&#13;
include piloting the use of countries' own environmental and&#13;
social safeguards and fiduciary systems, where applicable;&#13;
streamlining policy conditionality; and making greater use of&#13;
the flexibility of Country Assistance Strategies to customize&#13;
support to country circumstances, respond quickly to emerg-&#13;
ing opportunities, and realign investment lending instruments&#13;
and disbursement mechanisms with the evolving needs of&#13;
clients.The plan leverages Bank resources and skills to&#13;
provide timely, relevant, and high-quality knowledge services&#13;
that draw on Bank Group synergies and partnerships with&#13;
bilateral and multilateral agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Role of IBRD&#13;
IBRD is a AAA-rated financial institution--with some&#13;
unusual characteristics. Its shareholders are sovereign&#13;
governments, each of which has a voice in setting its policies&#13;
and many of which are eligible to borrow from it. IBRD's&#13;
main goal is to reduce poverty by promoting sustainable&#13;
economic development in middle-income and creditworthy&#13;
low-income borrowing countries. It provides financing (loans,&#13;
guarantees, and related risk management tools) and expertise&#13;
in development-related technical disciplines.&#13;
   It helps clients gain access to capital and financial risk&#13;
management tools in larger volumes, on better terms, at&#13;
longer maturities, and in a more sustainable manner than&#13;
they could receive from other sources. Unlike commercial&#13;
banks, IBRD is driven by development impact rather than&#13;
profit maximization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Eligibility to Borrow from IBRD&#13;
In fiscal 2005 countries with a per capita income of less than&#13;
$5,295 that were not IDA-only borrowers were eligible to&#13;
borrow from IBRD. Countries with higher per capita incomes&#13;
were able to borrow from IBRD under special circumstances&#13;
or as part of a graduation strategy.The amount IBRD is willing&#13;
to lend eligible countries depends on their creditworthiness;&#13;
some countries with poor creditworthiness may not have&#13;

                                                                  SUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR ACTIVITIES   61&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                          access to IBRD resources. Some countries that are&#13;
                                          eligible for IDA lending as a result of their low per capita&#13;
                                          incomes are also able to borrow from IBRD. IBRD loans&#13;
                                          outstanding to any individual borrowing country may not&#13;
                                          exceed $13.5 billion.&#13;

                                          At $13.6 billion for 118 operations, new loans, guarantees,&#13;
                                          and guarantee facilities by IBRD in fiscal 2005 exceeded the&#13;
                                          previous year's level by over $2 billion.This represents the&#13;
                                          highest volume of IBRD lending in the past six fiscal years.&#13;
                                          The share of development policy­based lending was slightly&#13;
                                          lower than in fiscal 2004.&#13;
                                             Latin America and the Caribbean received the highest level&#13;
                                          of IBRD loans and guarantees, with $4.9 billion or 36 percent&#13;
                                          of total IBRD commitments, followed by Europe and Central&#13;
                                          Asia with $3.6 billion and South Asia with $2.1 billion.&#13;
                                          Lending was slightly less concentrated than it was in fiscal&#13;
                                          2004.Whereas five countries received roughly 57 percent&#13;
                                          of total lending in fiscal 2004, five countries--Brazil, China,&#13;
                                          Colombia, India, and Turkey--received a combined commit-&#13;
                                          ment volume equaling 53 percent of total IBRD lending in&#13;
                                          fiscal 2005.&#13;
                                             Among sectors, public administration, including law and&#13;
                                          justice, received the highest volume of IBRD lending ($3.4&#13;
                                          billion), followed by transportation ($2.1 billion), and water,&#13;
                                          sanitation, and flood protection ($1.6 billion).&#13;
                                             The thematic composition of lending in fiscal 2005 was&#13;
                                          led by financial and private sector development, followed&#13;
                                          by environmental and natural resource management and&#13;
                                          social protection and risk management. Figures 3.11, 3.12,&#13;

                                          IBRD Resources&#13;
                                          IBRD obtains most of its funds by selling bonds in interna-&#13;
                                          tional capital markets. In fiscal 2005 it raised $13 billion&#13;
                                          at medium- to long-term maturities, roughly the same as in&#13;
                                          fiscal 2004. Debt securities, with a wide range of maturities&#13;
                                          and structures, were issued in 13 currencies.&#13;
                                             IBRD is able to borrow high volumes for long maturities&#13;
                                          on very favorable terms. IBRD's financial strength is based on&#13;
                                          its prudent financial policies and practices.These help IBRD&#13;
                                          maintain its high credit rating.&#13;
                                             As a cooperative institution, IBRD seeks not to maximize&#13;
                                          profit but to earn enough income to ensure its financial&#13;
                                          strength and sustain its development activities. IBRD's net&#13;

ing (borrowings related) derivative instruments, as required&#13;
by Financial Accounting Standard 133 and International&#13;
Accounting Standard 39, was $1,320 million in fiscal 2005.&#13;
IBRD retained $589.5 million in its general reserve and&#13;
$68 million in its pension reserve, added $52.5 million to&#13;
the surplus account, and transferred $400 million to IDA&#13;
and $210 million to the HIPC Trust Fund. (See Financial&#13;
Statements on the accompanying CD-ROM.)&#13;
    IBRD maintained adequate liquidity in fiscal 2005 to&#13;
ensure its ability to meet its obligations. As of June 30, 2005,&#13;
it held about $26.4 billion in liquid assets.&#13;
   As of June 30, 2005, IBRD's outstanding borrowings from&#13;
capital markets were about $91.5 billion (net of swaps) (see&#13;
figure 3.14).Total disbursed and outstanding loans were&#13;
$104.4 billion. Borrowings exceeded equity by a factor of&#13;
about three.&#13;
   Consistent with IBRD's development mandate, the principal&#13;
risk it takes is the country credit risk inherent in its portfolio&#13;
of loans and guarantees. Risks related to interest and exchange&#13;
rates are minimized. One summary measure of the Bank's risk&#13;
profile is the ratio of balance sheet equity to outstanding net&#13;
loans, which is closely managed in line with the Bank's finan-&#13;
cial and risk outlook.This stood at 31.4 percent as of June 30,&#13;
2005 (see figure 3.15).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PARTNERSHIPS&#13;
Globalization has brought about dramatic changes that&#13;
require collective action by public, private, and civil society&#13;
stakeholders.The Bank works with partners to manage&#13;
global, regional, and country programs where partners share&#13;
knowledge and play a joint role in funding, governance, or&#13;
management.These programs have become an important line&#13;
of business for the Bank. During fiscal 2005 the Bank worked&#13;
in consultation with key partners to develop a strategic&#13;
framework that will improve the Bank's selectivity and guide&#13;
its support to high-priority programs with potential for strong&#13;
development impact. (See "Evaluating the Bank's Work" in&#13;
chapter 1.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trust Funds&#13;
World Bank­administered trust funds foster partnerships by&#13;
mobilizing and directing concessional resources to support&#13;
poverty reduction across a wide range of sectors and regions,&#13;
supporting clients in achieving development results at the&#13;
global, regional, and country levels. Much of the recent growth&#13;
in these funds reflects the international community's desire&#13;
for the Bank to help manage broad global initiatives through&#13;
multilateral partnerships, such as the Global Fund to Combat&#13;
AIDS,Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Global Environment&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This World Bank Annual Report highlights
            the focus of the Bank activities in addressing worldwide
            poverty, describing the Bank work in promoting sustainable,
            economic growth, and in channeling needed services to poor
            people. Also detailed is the Bank's work toward
            achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); its
            institutional and global efforts toward effective
            development; and, its outreach to clients through Public
            Information Centers, and on the Web. Regional Perspectives
            are reviewed, through a breakdown of the Bank's lending
            and activities across the developing world, featuring
            highlights of projects in borrowing countries within each of
            the Bank's six regions. The Summary of Fiscal Year
            Activities provides a description of the Bank's
            development knowledge-sharing over the fiscal year 2005; a
            discussion of the Bank's approach to lending in low
            income, and middle-income countries; the Bank's
            resources; and a summary of the Bank's lending by
            region, theme, and sector, such as environmental programs
            and infrastructure projects. This section also describes the
            Bank's partnerships with public, private, and civil
            society stakeholders. The fiscal 2005 financial statements,
            organizational information, income by region, new operations
            approved in fiscal 2005, and various lending data are
            included on a CD inserted inside the back cover of this report.
