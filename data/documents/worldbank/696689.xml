PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE (IL&amp;FS) PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I - ECONOMIC AND SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
India's economic policies and performance&#13;
1.01  In mid-1991 India's development strategy took a radical turn when, in response to a&#13;
severe macroeconomic crisis, the new government launched an ambitious program of&#13;
economic reforms. The program did not limit itself to restoring macroeconomic stability. It&#13;
also reoriented structural policies governing the investment regime, foreign trade, the&#13;
financial sector, taxation, and public enterprises. As a result, almost all areas of the economy&#13;
have been opened to domestic and foreign private investment. Import licensing restrictions&#13;
on intermediate and capital goods have been virtually eliminated. Tariffs have been&#13;
significantly reduced and full convertibility has been established for current account&#13;
transactions. In the financial sector, prudential regulations that meet international standards&#13;
have been introduced; banks now have significantly more discretion in their lending&#13;
decisions; financial markets have been liberalized; and entry restrictions have been&#13;
eliminated. The external accounts have strengthened considerably and, although still a major&#13;
obstacle to higher growth, central fiscal imbalances have been lowered. The result has been a&#13;
rebouncing of the economy, helped by an unprecedented sequence of good monsoons and a&#13;
strong industrial recovery. GDP growth has been steadily increasing, from 1% p.a. in 1991-&#13;
92 to an estimated 5.8% in the current financial year. The robust performance of the Indian&#13;
economy is thus a testimony to the continuing favorable impacts of the liberalization and&#13;
reform efforts.&#13;
1.02  There are daunting challenges ahead. Paramount among them is that of meeting the&#13;
needs of a rapidly-growing population while reducing the incidence of poverty, in a country&#13;
with limited land and water resources, limited capital, and enormous social needs. In the next&#13;
30 years, even taking into account ongoing family planning efforts, India's population is&#13;
expected to increase by another 450 million. This "third India" will put enormous additional&#13;
pressure on the country's natural resources, social programs, and already strained&#13;
infrastructure. With the pace of urbanization accelerating, the consequences of population&#13;
growth will be particularly serious in urban areas where the provision of sanitation and public&#13;
health services as well as infrastructure is already below standard, and the absolute number of&#13;
poor is increasing.&#13;
1.03  The structural reforms introduced over the last four years have gone a long way in&#13;
reorienting India's development strategy to meet these challenges. For example, the private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
sector now plays a much more important role in India's development process, and an&#13;
incentive regime more conducive to a pattern of labor-intensive growth is being established.&#13;
However, there still remains a large "unfinished" reform agenda which will take several more&#13;
years to implement. Improving the fiscal situation, particularly with regard to states'&#13;
finances, is of critical importance. Equally important is the need to conclude the process of&#13;
structural reforms started in 1991 (e.g., in international trade, the financial system, the tax&#13;
regime, and public enterprises). Finally, reforms need to be extended to key sectors of the&#13;
economy, an issue where the participation of the states is critical because of their important&#13;
role in formulating and implementing sector policies. This is the case in agriculture, the&#13;
social sectors, and particularly infrastructure.&#13;
Evolving a policy and an institutionalframework/for private investment in infrastructure&#13;
1.04  The expansion and efficient use of infrastructure is fast becoming one of India's key&#13;
development issues. Of grave concern today is the risk that poor infrastructure will&#13;
undermine severely India's ability to achieve its medium- and long-term objectives of higher&#13;
and sustainable economic growth. At the root of the problem is a severe absorptive capacity&#13;
and implementation constraint which, combined with a financial constraint, has led to&#13;
chronic underinvestment in the sector and a less than optimal use of the funds available.&#13;
Implementation of public sector infrastructure projects has generally been slow, with frequent&#13;
cost overruns and inadequate construction quality. Addressing the situation requires, above&#13;
all, a redefinition of the role of the public sector in the provision of infrastructure and the&#13;
establishment of an appropriate legal, regulatory and administrative framework for private&#13;
investment so that the latter can assume a dynamic role in areas from which it has been&#13;
mostly excluded so far (telecommunications, power, ports, roads, urban infrastructure, water&#13;
supply). The impetus for change has to come primarily from the central and state&#13;
governments. A number of legislative steps and policy announcements have already been&#13;
made in that direction. In September 1991, the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 was&#13;
amended to permit private domestic and foreign investment in power. GOI's Telecom Policy&#13;
statement of May 1994 launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector. Finally,&#13;
the May 1995 amendment to the National Highway Act, 1956 permits private sector&#13;
participation in the development and maintenance of national highways and expressways.&#13;
The removal offormal barriers to private investment must now be followed by the&#13;
establishment of policy and institutional frameworks fully supportive of such investment.&#13;
1.05  The existing regulatory framework was formulated with the public sector in mind and&#13;
is not appropriate to encourage the massive private investments India needs in these areas.&#13;
Regulations governing entry, pricing in monopolistic conditions, the conduct of regulatory&#13;
authorities, dispute resolution and arbitration are either aimed at preventing private&#13;
investment or, in cases where the private sector is allowed, lead to inefficient investment.&#13;
The lack of finance on terms commensurate with the typical long gestation and revenue-&#13;
earning capacity of infrastructure projects is also slowing down the pace of private&#13;
investment in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Bank's assistance strategy in the infrastructure sector&#13;
1.06  Assistance on these policy issues has therefore received growing importance in the&#13;
Bank's work. The Bank group has pursued it through a variety of means. A substantial&#13;
amount of technical assistance has been provided in the context of loans or through the&#13;
administration of bilateral grants. In power for example, through the combination of project&#13;
preparation (e.g., proposed Orissa state power restructuring project, and similar operations in&#13;
Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan), bilaterally-funded technical assistance&#13;
programs, the ongoing technical assistance project for private power development, and the&#13;
preparation of a guarantee framework for private investments in power, considerable progress&#13;
has been achieved towards fundamental power sector reforms and the removal of essential&#13;
barriers to private investment. Similarly, in the telecoms sector, bilaterally-funded technical&#13;
assistance has enabled the Bank to assist in laying the ground for a regulatory framework&#13;
conducive to private sector entry. A port sector report provided the basis for our policy&#13;
dialogue in this area. In its sequel, the Bank has extended technical advice on the preparation&#13;
of international standard tender documents to induce private investment in new facilities and&#13;
in the management of existing facilities.&#13;
1.07   By contrast, our involvement in assisting in the establishment of an enabling&#13;
environment for private investment has been comparatively less intensive in the roads, water&#13;
supply and urban infrastructure sectors, partly because of the diversity of counterparts with&#13;
whom one needs to work (GOI, state governments, local governments, municipal&#13;
authorities). This is where the Bank's technical assistance is turning to now. A transport&#13;
sector report as well as the specific review, in the 1995 Country Economic Memorandum&#13;
(CEM), of bottlenecks to private investment in the roads sector have provided a valuable&#13;
opening for a dialogue on these issues. An urban infrastructure review is now under&#13;
preparation. Discussions are also underway for putting in place a program of assistance to&#13;
the Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST) to help develop a comprehensive regulatory and&#13;
administrative framework for private investment in the national highway sector and&#13;
providing technical advice to GOI for facilitating such private investment. In this sector,&#13;
however, as well as in water supply and urban infrastructure, much more needs to be done at&#13;
the state and local levels to enable efficient planning and implementation of private&#13;
investments.&#13;
1.08  In response to a request by Indian authorities, the Bank's latest country assistance&#13;
strategy (CAS) for FY96-98 proposes to increase the Bank's assistance in establishing an&#13;
environment conducive to efficient private investment in infrastructure. Direct lending&#13;
continues to be envisaged to power, roads and urban infrastructure but all loans in these areas&#13;
would be policy-based investment operations. At the Government's request, in those sectors&#13;
as well as in telecommunications and ports where there is already considerable private sector&#13;
willingness to invest, the Bank is considering providing private investors in infrastructure&#13;
with term financing through financial intermediaries. Such operations are designed to&#13;
support the establishment of policies and regulations conducive to efficient private&#13;
investment in infrastructure, using the intermediaries' interest in getting the framework right&#13;
(as tested in the telecoms sector). They are expected to play a catalytical role in mobilizing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
finance for private investment in infrastructure with more appropriate maturities than those&#13;
currently available. They will also assist financial intermediaries in developing appraisal and&#13;
risk evaluation procedures for large private infrastructure projects -- an area in which India's&#13;
financial sector has limited experience.&#13;
1.09  In this context, the first step was taken in September 1995 by restructuring the&#13;
ongoing Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project (Cr. 1923-IN) and promoting the entry of a&#13;
private fund manager to commercially manage the mix of public and private sources of&#13;
finance provided to the Municipal Development Fund. This is the first attempt made in one&#13;
state to establish a joint public-private partnership in the municipal infrastructure area. This&#13;
project is expected to provide a replicable regulatory and administrative environment for&#13;
investment -- public, private or mixed -- in municipal infrastructure.&#13;
1.10   The proposed Project is the second initiative. It seizes upon a unique opportunity&#13;
provided by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&amp;FS), a 51% privately-&#13;
owned finance company with strong ties to the public sector. By supporting IL&amp;FS's&#13;
expansion in this area, the focus of the Bank is to assist first hand in the development of&#13;
prototype contractual arrangements for private investment in IL&amp;FS's areas of involvement&#13;
(urban bypasses and bridges, water supply and sewerage, effluent treatment, and other&#13;
municipal infrastructure), thereby facilitating entry of the private sector on a much larger&#13;
scale in areas heretofore dominated by the public sector. It is a "process" operation whereby&#13;
the Bank uses IL&amp;FS as a vehicle to build up India's capacity to attract private investment in&#13;
infrastructure, pilot-test institutional and contractual arrangements in a variety of subprojects&#13;
under various administrative and political conditions, and help establish a track record as a&#13;
pre-requisite for large-scale private investment in the sector. GOI has selected IL&amp;FS as the&#13;
first financial intermediary to receive the Bank's support given the pioneering role it is&#13;
already playing in promoting private investment in infrastructure, its exceptional&#13;
understanding of the synergy required between public and private interests for successful&#13;
infrastructure development, its highly competent and innovative staff, and its high-quality&#13;
Board.&#13;
1.11   The third and much larger operation is the proposed Infrastructure Financing Project&#13;
(IFP) (FY98). With the removal of major policy and administrative barriers to private&#13;
investment in infrastructure through previous lending operations, sector work and TA&#13;
programs, financing on a much larger scale will then be possible. It is envisaged therefore to&#13;
expand the scope of the Bank's assistance significantly by involving several public financial&#13;
institutions and use the IFP as a vehicle to promote financial policy reforms aimed at&#13;
developing a domestic long-term debt market. The proposed agenda of reforms contains the&#13;
following key elements: (i) changing the investment guidelines applicable to, and increasing&#13;
competition among, contractual savings institutions; (ii) fostering the development of&#13;
benchmark interest rates; (iii) encouraging active management by institutions of their&#13;
securities portfolios; (iv) reducing transaction taxes; (v) rationalizing debt market regulations;&#13;
and (vi) establishing a secure clearing and settlement system for corporate debt services.&#13;
The sequencing and pace of the reforms will influence the speed at which the proposed&#13;
operation can be processed.&#13;

2.01  Ownership. In 1983, the Banking Regulation Act of 1949 was amended to allow&#13;
Indian commercial banks to enter the leasing business through separate subsidiaries. Central&#13;
Bank of India (CBI), a major nationalized commercial bank, decided to promote its leasing&#13;
activities through a joint venture with Unit Trust of India (UTI), a public sector mutual fund&#13;
management, and Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd. (HDFC), the country's&#13;
leading private housing finance institution. The result was the establishment of Infrastructure&#13;
Leasing and Financial Services Limited (IL&amp;FS) in 1987. Actual operations began in 1988&#13;
with the owners contributing Rs.60 million (about US$2 million) in the following&#13;
proportions: CBI (50.5%), UTI (30.5%), and HDFC (19%).&#13;
2.02  IL&amp;FS has since broadened its shareholder base not only to increase capital, but also&#13;
to strengthen business relationships and develop strategic alliances. For example, the&#13;
Intemational Finance Corporation (IFC) and, subsequently, ORIX Corporation, a Japanese&#13;
financial services company, were inducted as new shareholders in 1993 when the original&#13;
promoters diluted their equity stake in the company. More recently, in order to: (a) raise&#13;
capital, (b) broaden its name recognition in the public eye for further business development,&#13;
and (c) establish a "market" price for its shares, IL&amp;FS decided to proceed with an initial&#13;
public offering (IPO) equivalent to 25% of its enlarged capital. Due to the poor performance&#13;
of the capital markets, this issue has been temporarily warehoused with UTI; its launching is&#13;
now expected to take place in mid-1996. Once the IPO is completed, the ownership structure&#13;
of IL&amp;FS will be as shown in Figure 2. 1.&#13;

2.03  Board of Directors. The Board of Directors was initially constituted solely by&#13;
representatives of the three promoting institutions. In 1990, it was broadened to include a&#13;
number of prominent individuals from both the private and public sectors. It was again&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
restructured in 1995 to create 4 executive directorships that were filled by senior management&#13;
of the company. Annex 2.1 provides the current composition of IL&amp;FS's Board. The Board&#13;
meets every two months; it takes all policy decisions for the company and considers&#13;
approvals of business transactions of a significant value. It is well structured, with&#13;
representatives of all shareholders, government, private sector and employees. As IL&amp;FS's&#13;
business expands into commercial infrastructure projects, and to enhance the Board's&#13;
oversight function in this area, it might soon be desirable to appoint to the Board one or two&#13;
individuals with a strong private sector background in infrastructure development, finance or&#13;
construction. As a complement, IL&amp;FS may expand the practice of setting up panels of local&#13;
and international experts to assist Board members and senior management in decision-&#13;
making and implementation'. Given the significant role the Board plays in the conduct of&#13;
IL&amp;FS's operations, it would be beneficial to the Bank to be kept informed of the Board's&#13;
agenda of deliberations. Agreement was reached at negotiations that IL&amp;FS will provide to&#13;
the Bank, within 30 days after any meeting of its Board, the agenda of such meeting,&#13;
including all documents that were forwarded and considered at such meeting.&#13;
2.04   Management. Day-to-day management of the company, including major credit&#13;
investment and underwriting proposals subject to Board-established guidelines, is entrusted&#13;
to the Managing Director, who is assisted by four Executive Directors (EDs), who together&#13;
form the Committee of Directors (COD). Annex 2.2 provides a summary of the&#13;
organizational structure of the company. IL&amp;FS is managed in a flexible manner such that&#13;
assignments are often handled by ad hoc, interdisciplinary task groups. Considerable effort&#13;
has gone into corporate planning and management philosophy resulting in a well thought-out&#13;
corporate business plan and well-executed strategic plans (para. 2.14). The management&#13;
team (which has virtually been intact since the founding of the company) is aware of the&#13;
strengths and weaknesses of the corporation and has formulated strategies to compete with&#13;
much larger organizations both for new business and for human resources. One pillar of&#13;
IL&amp;FS's development strategy has been to forge relationships with a wide array of&#13;
international partners, either through joint ventures or cooperation agreements, so that the&#13;
company can position itself as a quality player in its mandated areas of operations and ensure&#13;
it has access to international technology and training2.&#13;
2.05    Staff and training. IL&amp;FS is a relatively lean organization; it employs a total of 189&#13;
staff, of which 126 are professional. The company has tended to bring in professionals with&#13;
substantial experience and has refrained from campus-based recruitment. Professional&#13;
careers are managed to give individuals varied exposure to the company's activities; to&#13;
facilitate this, IL&amp;FS has developed a modular organization structure with a high degree of&#13;
autonomy, and a work ethos which fosters independence and entrepreneurial behavior. To&#13;
Expert panels are already being established in the area of urban infrastructure and telecoms. Similar panels should be&#13;
considered for roads and water supply projects for example.&#13;
2   One example of such relationship has been the appointment of IL&amp;FS as country advisor to Oppenheimer &amp;&#13;
Company Inc. (USA) for their offshore country fund, the "India Fund Inc.". In that process, IL&amp;FS has registered&#13;
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an "Investment Advisor", an impressive achievement&#13;
given the rigorous SEC filing criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
motivate and retain competent professionals in a highly-competitive job market, the company&#13;
has evolved a variety of forward-looking remuneration strategies such as stock options, a&#13;
performance-related pay (PRP) program involving an appropriation of 5% of yearly net&#13;
profits -- the first such program to be offered in India by a financial institution -- and career&#13;
growth through joint ventures. As the company recruits only experienced staff, it does not&#13;
have a systematic training program for new entrants. However, it does provide training on&#13;
an ad hoc basis. Until now, training expenditures have remained relatively low. As IL&amp;FS&#13;
is embarking on a major move into the infrastructure business where little experience has yet&#13;
been gathered in India, it is building up its institutional capacity and plans to provide its&#13;
Projects staff with structured training programs to help them in the delivery of their&#13;
responsibilities, particularly in identification, evaluation, implementation monitoring, and&#13;
quality assurance functions (para. 3.07).&#13;
2.06   Systems and controls. financial reporting and audit. IL&amp;FS has in place well-&#13;
developed, high-quality accounting systems and internal auditing arrangements. The&#13;
principal instrument for management control is a budget which is approved by the Board.&#13;
IL&amp;FS uses a reputable firm of chartered accountants as external auditor. A formal system&#13;
has been in place since January 1993 to ensure compliance with: (i) the covenants and&#13;
investment agreements entered into with creditors and shareholders; (ii) the company's credit&#13;
policies and procedures, including those stipulated in its Operating Framework (para. 2.10);&#13;
and (iii) statutory and regulatory requirements. Following the establishment of regional&#13;
offices in Delhi and Bangalore, the company has further strengthened its accounting system&#13;
to better monitor the operations of its various profit centers from a geographical perspective.&#13;
It now needs to build up its capacity to carefully monitor the profitability of individual&#13;
products marketed by the company. This has clearly not been a problem until now: the&#13;
company has remained of a manageable size, thus enabling its senior management to keep&#13;
good track of the various business activities and their relative profitability. As the company&#13;
grows rapidly and the number of product lines multiplies -- as is currently anticipated -- such&#13;
monitoring will become increasingly difficult and therefore needs to be cast within a more&#13;
systematic framework. A comprehensive cost accounting system by product line thus needs&#13;
to be put in place (Annex 2.3 provides details on the general purpose of such a system).&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached that IL&amp;FS will establish and implement a&#13;
comprehensive cost accounting system by product line no later than March 31, 1997.&#13;
2.07  IL&amp;FS follows internationally accepted commercial accounting standards in&#13;
preparing its financial statements. The latter are presented in a format that meets the&#13;
requirements of the Indian Companies Act, 1956. These requirements, however, are better&#13;
suited for manufacturing companies than for financial institutions such as IL&amp;FS and make it&#13;
more difficult to interpret the company's financial situation. The reports submitted to the&#13;
Board for the annual budget provide a more comprehensible picture of IL&amp;FS's financial&#13;
performance. Agreement was reached at negotiations that IL&amp;FS will submit to the Bank by&#13;
June 30 of each year its annual audited accounts in the format required by the Companies Act&#13;
as well as its financial statements presented in the budget format and duly certified by the&#13;
auditor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9-&#13;
Regulations and operating policies&#13;
2.08   IL&amp;FS is a non-banking financial company (NBFC) regulated by the Reserve Bank&#13;
of India (RBI) under its NBFC (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1977, as amended (the&#13;
Directions). In addition, it is a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1956.&#13;
IL&amp;FS is recognized as a Category I Merchant Banker under the Security Exchange Board of&#13;
India (SEBI) Act. Its activities are monitored by the Department of Financial Companies of&#13;
the RBI, which performs inspections and reviews the portfolio and quarterly reports&#13;
submitted by IL&amp;FS for capital adequacy, asset quality, etc. IL&amp;FS is in general compliance&#13;
with all the applicable regulations.&#13;
2.09   Under the Directions, IL&amp;FS has been historically classified as an equipment leasing&#13;
company. In November 1994 it applied to RBI seeking a new NBFC classification given its&#13;
unique positioning in the infrastructure sector. This initiative was taken by IL&amp;FS as the&#13;
company is not currently meeting the RBI standards applicable to equipment leasing&#13;
companies3. In January 1996, RBI informed IL&amp;FS of its decision to retain the existing&#13;
classification of the company as an equipment leasing company until March 31, 1997 while&#13;
acknowledging IL&amp;FS's intention to make leasing and infrastructure finance its principal&#13;
business4. During negotiations, agreement was reached that any material modification to the&#13;
existing regulatory framework applicable to IL&amp;FS, that adversely affects the operations of&#13;
the company, will be an event of default under the loan.&#13;
2.10   In addition to the guidelines contained in the above-mentioned regulations, IL&amp;FS&#13;
has developed a comprehensive Operating Framework that spells out (i) the company's&#13;
operating policy, (ii) its risk management framework and policies, and (iii) guidelines and&#13;
framework of operations. The Framework was updated in July 1995 to reflect the company's&#13;
planned expanded involvement in commercial infrastructure projects. In particular, its risk&#13;
management framework and policies now set out in an extensive manner IL&amp;FS's risk&#13;
management philosophy and process, provides a detailed analysis of the types of risks&#13;
associated with its various activities, and proposes an array of risk mitigation measures to be&#13;
carefully monitored internally through a well-defined allocation of responsibilities5. In&#13;
general, the Operating Framework sets sound management principles. However, in some&#13;
instances, investment exposure limits are presented more as guidelines than strict ceilings&#13;
beyond which no further exposure should be taken. In these cases, the language of the&#13;
3   Such companies are required to have at least 50% of their assets in equipment leasing and hire-purchase business&#13;
taken together and earn at least 50% of their income from such business activities. IL&amp;FS does not wish to undertake&#13;
hire-purchase activities to meet the 50% requirement as the corporate sector (its main client base) is not amenable to&#13;
such activity. Given applicable fiscal and accounting norms, it is also not feasible ordinarily for an NBFC to have&#13;
leased assets equivalent to 50% of its portfolio.&#13;
4   As a result. leasing and infrastructure assets will be considered together in the calculation of the applicable standards.&#13;
5   Because of the increasing complexity of risk management. IL&amp;FS is planning to institute a "Risk Management&#13;
System" that would be entrusted to a Risk Management Group (RMG). The responsibility of the RMG, inter alia,&#13;
would include assisting IL&amp;FS's business managers in evaluating various risks in their business areas, initiate risk&#13;
mitigation steps. reporting risks to the various management levels for corrective actions, and ensuring compliance of&#13;
directives laid by the Board or the COD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Framework needs to be tightened accordingly. Furthermore, three specific aspects related to&#13;
the company's investment in commercial infrastructure projects need to be revised: (i)&#13;
because of the inherent risks associated with this type of projects, particularly with India's&#13;
and IL&amp;FS's limited track record in this area, it is considered more prudent that IL&amp;FS limit&#13;
its credit exposure to infrastructure projects to one third of the company's total credit&#13;
exposure (instead of the 40% of total assets currently provided for in the Framework). This&#13;
would ensure a careful balance between leaving enough room for IL&amp;FS to develop its&#13;
infrastructure business and ensuring that, as a result, it does not take excessive risks that&#13;
could threaten its fundamentally sound financial position; (ii) it is important to preserve the&#13;
integrity of lending decisions in those cases where IL&amp;FS may be both a significant equity&#13;
investor in and a lender to the same commercial infrastructure project entities; thus the sum&#13;
total of investments (including equity, loans and guarantees) in affiliates of the company&#13;
should not exceed 30% of IL&amp;FS's net worth; and (iii) when considering IL&amp;FS's total&#13;
equity investments -- which should not exceed its net worth -- all expenditures incurred by&#13;
IL&amp;FS on commercial infrastructure projects prior to financial closure should be treated as&#13;
equity. In close consultation with IFC, the Bank discussed with IL&amp;FS a proposal for&#13;
revising the related sections of the risk management framework that reflects the specific&#13;
conditions under which these projects will be implemented and the risks they will entail. The&#13;
agreed version is presented in Annex 2.4. During negotiations, agreement was reached that,&#13;
as a condition of loan effectiveness, IL&amp;FS will revise its Operating Framework to (i) set&#13;
definite investment exposure limits instead of guidelines, (ii) limit to one third of its total&#13;
credit exposure, IL&amp;FS's credit exposure to infrastructure projects, as calculated in&#13;
accordance with a methodology satisfactory to the Bank, (iii) limit to 30% of the company's&#13;
net worth its aggregate investments in entities in which its share in the paid-in capital is more&#13;
than 33 1/3%, and (iv) treat as equity all expenditures incurred by IL&amp;FS on infrastructure&#13;
projects prior to financial closure. In addition, agreement was reached that (i) IL&amp;FS will&#13;
continue to conduct its operations in accordance with the principles and procedures&#13;
enunciated in its revised Operating Framework, and (ii) any material modification to the&#13;
Operating Framework, without prior approval of the Bank, will be an event of default under&#13;
the loan.&#13;
IL&amp;FS's current operations&#13;
2.11   Assets. IL&amp;FS is engaged in lease and loan financing -- which constitutes its core&#13;
business -- as well as merchant banking and other financial activities. It is today one of the 5&#13;
largest and best regarded non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) in India; it is currently rated&#13;
"AAA" by Credit Analysis and Research Ltd. (CARE), one of the 3 Indian credit rating&#13;
agencies. Since the company was founded, revenues and net profit after tax have increased at&#13;
an average annual rate of 56% and 57%, respectively. Its assets have grown from Rs.734&#13;
million (US$44 million) in its first year of operation (FY88/89) to Rs. 13.2 billion (US$418&#13;
million) in FY94/95 -- an impressive growth rate of over 50% per year in local currency and&#13;
over 40% in US$ dollar terms. It has successfully built up its balance sheet with a safe, but&#13;
not overly profitable, lending and leasing business. As of March 31, 1995, loans and leases&#13;
accounted for 77% of the company's total assets and 76% of its income. The leasing&#13;
business is attractive to IL&amp;FS as the company benefits from accelerated tax depreciation on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Il -&#13;
its leased assets6. The core lending and leasing business is restricted to the country's top 60&#13;
corporate groups as well as creditworthy public sector agencies, which has meant that,&#13;
although risks are low, competition in this segment has limited profitability. IL&amp;FS tries to&#13;
differentiate itself from its competitors by providing products which are customized to client&#13;
needs. The quality of the lease and loan portfolio is good and has seen a marked&#13;
improvement over the last three years; it reflects not only the large, high-quality client base,&#13;
but also the company's tight credit control and portfolio management.7 In parallel with the&#13;
core business of lending and leasing, an investment banking business has evolved since&#13;
IL&amp;FS's inception. Asset-based investment banking activities are mainly securities&#13;
investment and trading, and property development. A growing area of business for IL&amp;FS is&#13;
now its fee-based investment banking activities: asset management, corporate and project&#13;
advisory work, and underwriting and issue management. To date, the contribution of the&#13;
bottom line of these activities has been modest, but its growth is a key component of&#13;
IL&amp;FS's business strategy (para. 2.15). IL&amp;FS is also engaged in the development of&#13;
various new businesses -- through the establishment of joint ventures -- most of which are a&#13;
logical extension of current activities that will give rise to new financial products or will&#13;
increase investment banking services that IL&amp;FS can offer. The breakdown of IL&amp;FS's&#13;
assets as of March 31, 1995 is presented in Figure 2.2 below.&#13;

2.12   Funding. Historically, IL&amp;FS has sourced its resource requirements through the&#13;
induction of new shareholders, and through its credit lines from commercial banks, Indian&#13;
financial institutions and multilateral agencies. Over the past few years, it has dramatically&#13;
changed its resource base. IL&amp;FS began as a subsidiary of a bank (CBI), which, along with&#13;
6   The volume of leasing in each year is set in order to bring IL&amp;FS's taxable income to zero.&#13;
7   As of March 3 I. 1995, arrears on leases over 90 days represented 0.3% of total lease receivables; arrears on loans&#13;
over 90 days accounted for 0. 1% of total loan receivables. Loans and leases affected by arrears over 90 days&#13;
represented 2.2% and 1.5% of total loan and leasing assets respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the company's other major shareholders, served as the main source of funds. The opening of&#13;
its capital to new strategic shareholders (IFC and ORIX) not only broadened its equity base&#13;
but also facilitated the company's access to a wider range of debt funds. At present, IL&amp;FS&#13;
borrows from multilaterals8 (IFC and the Asian Development Bank), local banks (it has&#13;
obtained renewable credit lines from a consortium of 19 banks), domestic financial and&#13;
investmnent institutions and insurance companies (an important source of medium- to long-&#13;
term fimds9). IL&amp;FS has also been successful in mobilizing funds through the placement of&#13;
commercial paper (CP) and issue of debentures to select corporate groups in an attempt to&#13;
diversify its resource base. Figure 2.3 presents IL&amp;FS's liability profile as of March 31,&#13;

Future strategy andfinancial performance&#13;
2.13 One of IL&amp;FS 's primary mandates was to establish itself as a premier institution to&#13;
structure and finance, both directly and through syndication, private infrastructure projects.&#13;
The fulfilment of this objective was deferred to allow the company to build up its balance&#13;
sheet to a size sufficient to enable it to take on the requisite risks associated with lumpy&#13;
infrastructure investments. With total assets estimated to reach Rs. 16,307 million (US$470&#13;
million) at the end of the current financial year and a net worth of Rs.3,732 million (US$110&#13;
million), it is now in a position to start financing infrastructure projects. To reinforce this&#13;
state of readiness is the strength derived from a unique combination of public and private&#13;
sector influences that have defined the company's development until now. IL&amp;FS has&#13;
consistently built upon the special position it has enjoyed from having been promoted by&#13;
public-sector institutions and being overseen by an influential Board of Directors. At the&#13;
same time, its management and professional staff, having been recruited largely from the&#13;
8   The average tenor of these borrowings, which are mainly for lending towards import of capital assets, is 10 years.&#13;
9   The tenor of these facilities is typically between 5 and 8 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
private sector rather than the promoting institutions, have left the company with a distinctly&#13;
private sector culture. This unique characteristic is seen as a key strength to enable IL&amp;FS to&#13;
enter the commercial infrastructure business in a major way. It has started to position itself&#13;
as the leader in developing the concept for commercializing infrastructure projects, the&#13;
associated legal framework as well as financing alternatives. Over the last few years, IL&amp;FS&#13;
has been actively engaged in creating and developing frameworks to enable such&#13;
commercialization, and has been in continuous dialogue with the relevant authorities in order&#13;
to develop policy as well as the recommended legislative changes that promote such intent.&#13;
The sectors chosen by IL&amp;FS for initial development were power and telecommunications,&#13;
surface transport and transportation systems. As explained earlier (para. 1.06), power and&#13;
telecommunications are somewhat better positioned for commercial implementation;&#13;
IL&amp;FS's initial focus in these sectors has therefore been towards providing investment&#13;
banking services. The surface transport sector has been far different in that IL&amp;FS has had to&#13;
develop models which are sought to be replicable across the sector and structured to facilitate&#13;
market borrowings. Thus, in these areas, IL&amp;FS has been required to undertake a&#13;
multiplicity of roles in a project, including initial conceptualization, development, financing,&#13;
implementation and management. Its record to date in this area is limited to the successful&#13;
implementation of a small toll road in Madhya Pradesh (the 11.5-km Rau-Pithampur bypass);&#13;
it has also advanced significantly the preparation of three additional projects, two of which&#13;
(Delhi-NOIDA bridge and Panvel bypass) are in the final stages of development.&#13;
2.14  Corporate business plan. IL&amp;FS has developed a comprehensive corporate business&#13;
plan for the next five years to manage a successful move into infrastructure. The plan has&#13;
been conceived in the light of the prevailing economic environment in India, and IL&amp;FS's&#13;
perception that the changes over the last few years would continue into the foreseeable future.&#13;
It reflects IL&amp;FS's keen interest in preserving its position in the market as a prudently&#13;
managed, commercially oriented and profitable institution, and maintaining its track record&#13;
of innovation and delivery. A summary of IL&amp;FS's projected financial performance is&#13;
presented in Table 2.1 below. Past and projected income statements, cash flow statements&#13;
and balance sheets are provided in Annex 2.5.&#13;

2.15   The main thrust of IL&amp;FS's growth over the next 5 years will be the dramatic&#13;
expansion of its commercial infrastructure project portfolio, which, for the moment, is&#13;
limited to the Rau-Pithampur toll road'". Commercial infrastructure assets are projected to&#13;
amount to about Rs.9.863 million (US$280 million) by the end of 2000/01 as compared to&#13;
Rs.275 million (US$8 million) as of March 31, 1995. To sustain this growth, IL&amp;FS has&#13;
forecasted a robust expansion of its core loan and leasing business that would increase by&#13;
about 24% p.a. over the period, a pace considered achievable in light of the projected overall&#13;
economic and industrial growth in India. Another important feature of IL&amp;FS's corporate&#13;
plan is the significant growth in non-fund based business derived from a conscious effort at&#13;
developing a wide range of advisory services". The impact of such development would be&#13;
0   The Rau-Pithampur toll road, being the first commercial infrastructure project arranged by IL&amp;FS, was actually&#13;
implemented by the company acting as project developer; the total cost of the project appears therefore as an asset on&#13;
IL&amp;FS's balance sheet. IL&amp;FS has just received approval to domicile the asset into a special purpose vehicle in&#13;
which the Government of Madhya Pradesh will take a 20% stake. The SPV will then issue toll revenue bonds, a first&#13;
for India.&#13;
l  IL&amp;FS plans to offer a range of advisory services encompassing: (i) corporate advisory services (structured finance,&#13;
capital markets, project financing), (ii) securities management, and (iii) infrastructure advisory services. For example,&#13;
with the experience gained as country advisor to the Oppenheimer "India Fund", is now spearheading the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
reflected in a relatively rapid growth in fee income (28% p.a.). Finally, the plan assumes&#13;
that the existing fiscal regime applicable to leasing activities would be maintained. In the&#13;
event the prevailing incentives are either reduced or eliminated, IL&amp;FS could, to a certain&#13;
extent, pass on the associated additional costs through an increase in its spread. However, it&#13;
would also likely face stiffer competition and see a slower growth in its leasing assets. To&#13;
evaluate the impact of possible events on IL&amp;FS's financial performance, a sensitivity&#13;
analysis was carried out using different scenarios (Annex2..6). If IL&amp;FS's growth in assets&#13;
were significantly curtailed as compared to the base case scenario presented above, and and if&#13;
there were no income from capital gains and no growth in fee income -- a worst case scenario&#13;
-- the company's return on net worth would basically remain at its present level (about 14-&#13;
15%), while its debt service capability, as measured by its debt service coverage ratio, would&#13;
actually improve as a result of lower funding requirements.&#13;
2.16   The company's move into the infrastructure sector means that the average maturity&#13;
of its assets will grow. In order to manage its liquidity risk, the average maturity of its&#13;
borrowings must also be increased. IL&amp;FS is therefore looking to take up more medium-&#13;
and long-term debt. Although it is already raising medium-term funding from domestic&#13;
commercial banks, their capacity to provide longer maturity debt is limited. In the absence of&#13;
a well-functioning long-term debt market in India, IL&amp;FS has no other option but tap foreign&#13;
sources for long-term funds. IFC is not in a position to provide additional funds with&#13;
maturities and on the substantially-increased scale that is now being sought by the company -&#13;
- IL&amp;FS is already the largest exposure of IFC's Asia Capital Markets Department. The&#13;
Bank is thus considered to be the main source of funds to meet the pressing needs for long-&#13;
term financing. In addition to the Bank loan, USAID has approved a US$25 million line of&#13;
credit to IL&amp;FS in support of one of the projects in the pipeline (Tirupur integrated area&#13;
development program). The company is discussing further non-rupee lines with other&#13;
foreign agencies (DEG of Germany, USEximbank, FMO of Holland) as well as a number of&#13;
international commercial banks interested in the Indian market (ING Bank, Bank of America,&#13;
Chase Manhattan, Societe Generale, Fuji Bank and Deutsche Bank). While the potential&#13;
sources of foreign funding are wide and numerous, a significant constraint may be the ability&#13;
to swap these funds into rupees.&#13;
2.17 The development of IL&amp;FS's infrastructure business will modify the risk profile of&#13;
what is currently a very prudently managed enterprise. The prudential guidelines embedded&#13;
in RBI's Directions are certainly appropriate for IL&amp;FS's current set of activities, essentially&#13;
low-risk lending and leasing to top Indian corporates, but they are insufficient for higher-risk&#13;
and lumpier infrastructure development and financing. IL&amp;FS's risk management&#13;
framework addresses by and large this concern (para. 2. 10). As a complement, agreement&#13;
was reached during negotiations on the following two financial performance targets for&#13;
IL&amp;FS: (i) maintain at all times a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.25; and (ii)&#13;
maintain at all times a debt to equity ratio of not more than 6:1.&#13;
development of specialty funds for the infrastructure sector, the first of which is being established with American&#13;
Insurance Group (AIG) (USA). The first tranche of US$70 million was closed on January 10, 1996 and included&#13;
anchor investors such as ADB, Orix and Tata Industries; the second, of US$80 million, is expected to close in April&#13;
1996.&#13;
&#13;

III - THE PROJECT&#13;
Project objectives&#13;
3.01   The Project aims to develop prototype contractual arrangements for private&#13;
investment in IL&amp;FS's areas of involvement, thereby facilitating entry of the private sector&#13;
on a much larger scale in areas heretore dominated by the public sector. In the process, it&#13;
would build up India's capacity to attract private investment in infrastructure, pilot-test&#13;
institutional and contractual arrangements in a variety of subprojects under various&#13;
administrative and political conditions, and help establish a track record as a prerequisite for&#13;
large scale private investment in the sector. The Project would also meet the pressing needs&#13;
of commercial infrastructure project entities for long-term rupee financing. pending the&#13;
implementation of financial sector reforms for the development of a domestic long-term debt&#13;
market, currently under preparation. Equally important, it would foster efficiency in the&#13;
delivery and use of selected infrastructure services, encourage the establishment of more&#13;
efficient practices in the construction and operation of infrastructure project, and assist in&#13;
alleviating the severe financial and institutional constraints to the expansion of infrastructure&#13;
in India.&#13;
Project description&#13;
3.02   The Project will assist IL&amp;FS in financing infrastructure subprojects such as major&#13;
bridges, urban bypasses, port facilities, water supply and effluent treatment schemes, and&#13;
integrated area development projects, to be implemented on a build-operate-and-transfer&#13;
(BOT) basis (or a variation thereof) and expected to be started within the next three years. It&#13;
consists of three interrelated components:&#13;
+  an investment component in the forn of a line of credit to IL&amp;FS, the proceeds of which&#13;
will be used to provide long-term finance to special purpose entities established for the&#13;
construction and operation of commercial infrastructure projects in IL&amp;FS's pipeline&#13;
(para. 3.04);&#13;
*  a subproject preparation component to cover specialized consultancy services to advise&#13;
the public authorities granting the subproject concessions or to assist project developers&#13;
in preparing their subprojects (para. 3.05); and&#13;
*  a training and technical assistance component to cover (i) IL&amp;FS's staff development for&#13;
its staff, (ii) specific studies that IL&amp;FS is undertaking to facilitate the evaluation and&#13;
implementation of commercial infrastructure projects (e.g., legal and regulatory&#13;
framework applicable to BOT projects in sectors of IL&amp;FS's interest, innovative&#13;
financing for environmental infrastructure in medium-sized cities and townships, traffic&#13;
forecasting, willingness to pay and fixation of user charges for water supply and road&#13;
projects) (para. 3.07).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
Indicative pipeline of subprojects&#13;
3.03  IL&amp;FS has identified a long list of subprojects which it may eventually consider for&#13;
financing and which provides valuable information on the potential size of the market.&#13;
However, it is clear that some of the projects in that list may either slip or not be executed at&#13;
all, while new subprojects may be incorporated at a later date. In the course of preparing the&#13;
Project, the Bank and IL&amp;FS agreed that, to achieve the maximum results, it would be best to&#13;
focus on certain priority sectors and establish a track record in India, that would then&#13;
facilitate replicability in future. A set of eligibility criteria for the line of credit has thus been&#13;
developed and is presented in Annex 3.1. Agreement was reached at negotiations that these&#13;
eligibility criteria will be applicable to all subprojects to be funded under the line of credit&#13;
unless otherwise agreed by the Bank on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
3.04  Given the above criteria and after reviewing the state of preparedness of each&#13;
subproject, IL&amp;FS has drawn up an indicative pipeline of subprojects (Annex 3.2)&#13;
tentatively considered for financing under the Project. It is a scaled-down version of the&#13;
above-mentioned list, bearing in mind that (i) commercial infrastructure projects take a&#13;
considerable time to develop, and (ii) IL&amp;FS can only gradually build up its capacity to&#13;
handle the correspondingly large volume of appraisal work. The pipeline includes 18&#13;
geographically dispersed subprojects, distributed as follows: (i) 10 are in transport (urban&#13;
bypasses and bridges, roads and highways, railways), (ii) 6 are area development projects&#13;
(including a combination of water supply, effluent treatment, power supply and road&#13;
development schemes). (iii) one is a port facility, and (iv) the last one is a large area&#13;
development project to be developed in stages (Bay of Cambay). Some of the subprojects are&#13;
at a relatively advanced stage of preparation and have a high probability of being&#13;
implemented under the Project, they are expected to start construction within the next 18&#13;
months. By contrast, others are only at the preliminary development stage and the&#13;
probability that they will be ready for implementation within the next three years is, at the&#13;
moment, somewhat lower. Any slippage on these projects is expected to be made up by other&#13;
projects currently under development and not included in the pipeline.&#13;
Project cost and financing plan&#13;
3.05  The aggregate cost of the subprojects in the pipeline (including development costs) is&#13;
estimated at about Rs.58,000 million (US$1.6 billion). The figures indicated above provide&#13;
an order of magnitude of the investments envisaged. Out of this aggregate cost, development&#13;
expenses for projects still at their initial stage of development and envisaged to be financed&#13;
under the Project are estimated at about US$19 million, US$5 million of which would&#13;
correspond to the cost of advisory services (including computer hardware and software)&#13;
which public sector authorities (e.g., GOI, state governments, municipalities) could avail of&#13;
to select BOT operators and negotiate concession agreements. It is proposed to finance this&#13;
latter subcomponent through an IDA credit to GOI, the proceeds of which would be utilized&#13;
by the concerned GOI or state government agencies. Agreement was reached at negotiations&#13;
that the IDA credit will become effective only once the loan to IL&amp;FS has been made&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
effective. It is still too early to provide a reasonable estimate of the breakdown of costs&#13;
between local and direct or indirect foreign currrency expenditures; this will likely vary&#13;
considerably from subproject to subproject, depending on the nature of the subproject, the&#13;
BOT operator, and the extent to which the contractor imports construction equipment. Given&#13;
the experience gathered so far on the first two subprojects in the pipeline, the foreign cost&#13;
component is likely to be higher than for public sector projects as great emphasis is placed in&#13;
introducing best international practices through a careful selection of consortium members&#13;
for the special purpose entities. It has thus been assumed that about 40% of the subproject&#13;
costs would be in foreign currency.&#13;
3.06   The subprojects would be developed with a mix of financing comprising: equity from&#13;
project sponsors and other partners such as institutional investors (through specialty equity&#13;
funds), debt financing from contractors or suppliers, term financing from other domestic&#13;
financial institutions, banks and the domestic markets (e.g., through the offering of "toll&#13;
revenue bonds"), and long-term financing from multilateral agencies such as the proposed&#13;
Bank loan and bilateral funds such as the US$25 million line of credit from USAID. As part&#13;
of its review of each individual subproject (paras. 3.08 and 3.13), the Bank will also assess&#13;
whether a World Bank guarantee might be an appropriate vehicle for Bank support to the&#13;
subproject, either as a complement to or a substitute for a subloan from IL&amp;FS. The amnount&#13;
of the Bank loan has been deliberately set at a relatively conservative level to reflect&#13;
uncertainties as to the pace of implementation of the subprojects and hence of disbursement&#13;
from the loan. However, should the subprojects materialize more rapidly than anticipated,&#13;
additional commitments could be envisaged through guarantees and/or a second line of credit&#13;
to IL&amp;FS. Bringing the subprojects to financial closure will require a mix of project&#13;
development expertise and relatively novel and complex financial engineering. IL&amp;FS is&#13;
expected to play a key catalytic role in the process. It will build on its proven record of&#13;
success in investment banking and financial services, and the strategic alliances it has&#13;
established with foreign institutional investors'2. For all subprojects in its pipeline, IL&amp;FS is&#13;
also laying great emphasis on aligning the interests of the major stakeholders and the local&#13;
governments in the success of the projects. Table 3.1 below provides an indicative project&#13;
cost and financing plan.&#13;
12  For example, IL&amp;FS will offer to the AIG equity fund all the infrastructure projects it is aware of. It has also been in&#13;
discussion with General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC) for a relationship for infrastructure deal referrals for&#13;
which IL&amp;FS would receive a fee.&#13;

Project implementation and monitoring&#13;
3.07  The Project will be implemented by IL&amp;FS, acting as equity investor and lender to&#13;
the special purpose entities. During project preparation, the Bank reviewed in detail IL&amp;FS's&#13;
project appraisal procedures and capabilities and suggested a number of adjustments to be&#13;
made in the company's organizational structure, staffing and processes so that it would be&#13;
better equipped to handle the anticipated large volume of infrastructure business. Key&#13;
reassignment and recruitment decisions were subsequently made by IL&amp;FS's management,&#13;
internal processes and procedures have since been clearly formulated, and greater recourse is&#13;
being made to outside expertise to assist in project appraisal. In addition, a comprehensive&#13;
planning exercise has been carried out by IL&amp;FS to assess the manpower requirements --&#13;
both internal and external -- of its infrastructure business, evaluate training needs and&#13;
estimate the cost of consultancy services. A summary of the training program and technical&#13;
assistance activities envisaged by IL&amp;FS is provided in Annex 3.3.&#13;
3.08  IL&amp;FS has designed a comprehensive system of steps and procedures to be followed&#13;
by its staff for appraising subprojects and evaluating subloan applications. The resulting&#13;
project cycle is an elaborate and well-thought out project evaluation system (Annx3.4).&#13;
However, for IL&amp;FS, some of the subproject appraisal activities will be undertaken for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
first time in a structured format. Systems must therefore be in place that are of a standard&#13;
and quality that can withstand the scrutiny of all potential financiers. Because of the size,&#13;
relative complexity and novelty of the subprojects which the proposed loan will finance, it is&#13;
highly desirable that all subproject appraisal activities be carried out in close consultation&#13;
with the Bank. It has been agreed with IL&amp;FS that, for the first two subprojects in each&#13;
sector category (e.g., roads, water supply, integrated area development)'3, there would be&#13;
close interaction with the Bank as appraisal of infrastructure projects is still an area where the&#13;
company has least experience and where the Bank can contribute most. In particular, the full&#13;
documentation on the contractual framework for the subprojects (e.g., concession agreement,&#13;
construction contract, O&amp;M contract, lenders' agreement, shareholders' agreement) will be&#13;
reviewed in detail by the Bank for their risk mitigation aspects. This is critical as IL&amp;FS is&#13;
breaking new grounds in India and is thereby setting precedents that may potentially become&#13;
government policies. For all subprojects, IL&amp;FS will prepare a detailed subproject&#13;
evaluation report, an outline of which is provided in Annex 3.5. These arrangements were&#13;
confirmed during loan negotiations.&#13;
3.09   Performance monitoring indicators have been established that will provide tools for&#13;
monitoring progress of the Project and the extent to which it is meeting its development&#13;
objectives (Annex 3.6). A comprehensive management review of all aspects of the Project,&#13;
including IL&amp;FS's operations, financial performance and annual budget, will be carried out&#13;
before April 30 of each year. In addition, a mid-term review of the Project will be held&#13;
before April 30, 1998 to take stock of the progress to date and identify any appropriate&#13;
measures to improve implementation of the Project, as the need may arise. These&#13;
arrangements were confirmed during loan negotiations. Given the Bank's expected intensive&#13;
involvement throughout the life of the Project, and especially in the first two years where&#13;
considerable efforts will be deployed to put in place an appropriate contractual framework&#13;
that would be replicated for subsequent projects, unusually large supervision resources will&#13;
be required to monitor project implementation. An indicative supervision plan is provided in&#13;
Annex 3.7; it may be reviewed and updated as appropriate during project implementation.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.10   In line with the Bank's revised procurement guidelines, two courses of action are&#13;
envisaged for the procurement of goods and services under the Project. Whenever possible,&#13;
and particularly for those subprojects in which IL&amp;FS's involvement is identified at an early&#13;
stage, it is envisaged that BOT operators will be selected through international competitive&#13;
bidding, following which the selected operator will be free to procure goods, works and&#13;
services required for the facility using its own procedures. As part of the advisory services&#13;
IL&amp;FS is providing to state and local governments for the preparation of subprojects, IL&amp;FS&#13;
has sought consultants' advice to develop the basic documentation for selecting a BOT&#13;
operator. It is also looking to the Bank for assistance in developing acceptable procedures for&#13;
13 Namely, the Panvel bypass, the Delhi-NOIDA bridge, the Tirupur area development program and the Dewas water&#13;
supply scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
inviting and evaluating proposals. During project preparation, the Bank already provided&#13;
some inputs. General guidelines were discussed with IL&amp;FS which, in some instances, is&#13;
acting as advisor to state governments or other public agencies that will eventually manage&#13;
the competitive bidding process (Annex 3.8). Given the diversity of subprojects, the lack of&#13;
experience with competitive selection of private infrastructure operators in India and the&#13;
limited availability of reference documents in the Bank to guide IL&amp;FS in carrying out such&#13;
procurement, it is anticipated that extensive work will be required in this area in the early&#13;
stage of project implementation. In those cases where the BOT operator will not be selected&#13;
on a competitive basis, construction contracts or supply of construction materials and&#13;
equipment will be procured following normal World Bank ICB procedures, unless otherwise&#13;
agreed with the Bank on a case-by-case basis. During project preparation, the Bank reviewed&#13;
the procurement and contracting activities for two of such cases and suggested a number of&#13;
improvements to be made in the area of procurement procedures and bid documentation to&#13;
ensure that IL&amp;FS adopts international best practices. Technical assistance and consultancy&#13;
services would be procured in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's guidelines for the&#13;
use of consultants. Table 3.2 below provides a summary of the procurement arrangements&#13;
envisaged under the project.&#13;

Security arrangements&#13;
3.11   The Bank loan will be a US$ LIBOR-based loan. It will be extended directly to&#13;
IL&amp;FS and guaranteed by GOI. The provision of GOI guarantees in support of&#13;
infrastructure development in general is under active consideration by a high-powered&#13;
working group within the Ministry of Finance. Its recommendations are expected to be&#13;
submitted before the end of March 1996. At that time only will the detailed terms and&#13;
conditions of GOI's guarantee of the Bank loan to IL&amp;FS be finalized. However, agreement&#13;
was reached at negotiations that GOI will levy a guarantee fee of not less than 1.2% on the&#13;
4  The amounts shown correspond to IBRD/IDA financing; as of the appraisal date the respective total cost of the&#13;
individual subprojects is not known and therefore not shown in the procurement table.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
amounts outstanding and disbursed, a level considered appropriate considering the pioneering&#13;
role IL&amp;FS is expected to play in establishing a track record for India in the area of private&#13;
investment in infrastructure. Agreement was also reached that, as a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness, GOI and IL&amp;FS will enter into an indemnity agreement on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. In addition to the GOI guarantee, the Bank will take a&#13;
pari passu interest in the security structure currently in force in respect of the present lenders&#13;
to IL&amp;FS (Annex 3.9). To complete the security package, an inter-creditor agreement needs&#13;
to be in place. IL&amp;FS has finalized the agreement to the satisfaction of the Bank and will&#13;
circulate it shortly to all the other lenders for their comments. Agreement was reached at&#13;
negotiations that, as a condition of loan effectiveness, the security arrangements for the&#13;
World Bank loan will be completed, including the placement of the loan under the mortgage&#13;
shared equally with other lenders and the execution of the inter-creditor agreement.&#13;
Onlending and disbursement&#13;
3.12   The proposed loan to IL&amp;FS is meant to meet the pressing needs of commercial&#13;
infrastructure project entities for long-term rupee financing, pending the implementation of&#13;
financial sector reforms for the development of a domestic long-term debt market (para.&#13;
1. 11). Furthermore, given the intrinsic risks of infrastructure projects and the fact that cost&#13;
recovery will, in most if not all cases, be in local currency, it is considered more prudent not&#13;
to pass on the foreign exchange risk to the final beneficiaries of the loan so as to preserve the&#13;
financial viability of the subprojects. Proceeds of the loan to IL&amp;FS will therefore be onlent&#13;
to the subproject entities, mainly in the form of rupee term loans with maturities matching&#13;
that of the original loan to IL&amp;FS as closely as possible (17-20 years) and a market-&#13;
determined rate'5. Only in exceptional cases will IL&amp;FS onlend in US dollars in which case&#13;
it will charge a market-determined variable rate'6. These onlending arrangements were&#13;
confirmed at negotiations. For subloans made in rupees, IL&amp;FS will bear the foreign&#13;
exchange risk. The company plans to hedge the currency risk by swapping the proceeds of&#13;
the Bank loan into back-to-back rupee-denominated loans with the same repayment&#13;
structures as the Bank loan. For this to be cost-effective in the absence of a swap market in&#13;
India, IL&amp;FS will need to do it in amounts of at least US$25 million at the minimum. To&#13;
enable IL&amp;FS to arrange these swap transactions, a Special Account, with an authorized&#13;
allocation of US$25 million, will be established in a commercial bank, on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The amounts deposited in the Special Account will be&#13;
used exclusively for executing the swap transactions, and the rupees obtained therefrom will&#13;
be deposited into a Swap Account, to be used for eligible expenditures. Annex 3.1 0 provides&#13;
further details on such arrangements. They were confirmed at negotiations. Depending on&#13;
the terms of the swap agreement, IL&amp;FS may onlend the proceeds of the loan at a fixed or&#13;
variable rate. In either event IL&amp;FS will not bear the interest rate risk. The IDA credit will&#13;
5  IL&amp;FS estimates that, under prevailing conditions, it would onlend at a spread of 400 basis points over the lending&#13;
rate obtained from the swap counterparty.&#13;
16  Under present conditions and given the cost of the funds to IL&amp;FS, the company reckons that it would onlend at a&#13;
spread of 400 basis points over LIBOR.&#13;

be onlent on the standard terms and conditions applicable to central assistance to the states at&#13;
the time.&#13;
3.13  As indicated earlier, subprojects financed by the line of credit will need to meet&#13;
specific eligibility criteria (para. 3.03). In particular, subprojects will need to comply with&#13;
the following financial performance benchmarks:&#13;
* a capital structure for the SPV of no more than 75% debt, with the promoter's&#13;
contribution representing at least 25% of the paid-in capital;&#13;
* a project debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.25 on an annual cash-flow basis;&#13;
and&#13;
* the entire financing package to have been finalized (committed or raised) or promoter&#13;
guarantees of high quality to have been provided prior to the finalization of the financial&#13;
package.&#13;
These will need to be fully documented in the subproject evaluation report prepared by&#13;
IL&amp;FS, which will form the basis for the Bank's review of individual subprojects.&#13;
Agreement was reached at negotiations that, as conditions of disbursement for the investment&#13;
component, (i) IL&amp;FS will submit to the Bank, for its review and approval, the final project&#13;
evaluation report, including the environmental and social (EA/SA) assessment reports, and&#13;
(ii) the contracts for the financing of the subproject will have been executed together with all&#13;
the other contracts associated with the implementation of the subproject.&#13;
3.14  Drawdowns from each subloan will be contingent on the SPV meeting conditions&#13;
precedent relative to progress of construction. Such conditions would be specified in the&#13;
lender's agreement between IL&amp;FS and the SPV and would be spelled out in the evaluation&#13;
report submitted by IL&amp;FS to the Bank. Disbursements under the loan will be made for&#13;
100% of the amounts paid by IL&amp;FS for expenditures incurred under eligible subloans;&#13;
disbursements for consultancy services and training will be for 100% of expenditures.&#13;
Disbursements under the credit will be for: (i) 100% of expenditures for consultancy services,&#13;
and (ii) for equipment and software, 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local&#13;
expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 80% of local expenditures for other items procured locally.&#13;
As indicated in the eligibility criteria, proceeds of the Bank loan would not cover more than&#13;
25% of the total cost of individual subprojects. The loan is expected to disburse over a five-&#13;
year period. An indicative schedule of disbursements has been assumed in the financial&#13;
projections for IL&amp;FS (Annex 2.5). The cut-off date for new loan commitments to be&#13;
financed under the Project would be December 31, 1998. The Project would be completed&#13;
by March 31, 2001 and the closing date for the loan would be September 30, 2001.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Environmental and social considerations&#13;
3.15  IL&amp;FS, with assistance from an NGO, has prepared an Environmental and Social&#13;
Report (ESR), the objective of which was to put in place an environmental and social&#13;
assessment process which adequately responds to GOI requirements and, for subprojects&#13;
involving Bank financing, the Bank's operational directives (ODs). Organized in 3&#13;
volumes'7, the ESR: (a) states the company's environmental and social goals; (b) provides&#13;
the contextual setting for the environmental and social assessment process; (c) identifies the&#13;
major issues in the priority sectors; (d) details the environmental assessment and social&#13;
assessment (EA/SA) process that IL&amp;FS will follow when appraising suprojects; (e) outlines&#13;
methods to moderate risks and liabilities due to environmental and social factors; (f) specifies&#13;
the organizational arrangements in IL&amp;FS to manage the environmental and social&#13;
assessment process; and (g) spells out the staff development plan. Relevant regulations,&#13;
guidelines (including the Bank's relevant operational directives), checklists and protocols are&#13;
provided as an attachment to the report. Land acquisition and resettlement procedures&#13;
described in the ESR will apply only to land acquired, whether by public or private sector&#13;
agencies, on or after June 15, 1995 (the date of commencement of preparation of the ESR).&#13;
During project preparation, the Bank "field-tested" the ESR approach in the context of one&#13;
subproject (para. 3.17) and met with various government officials and NGOs to assess their&#13;
concurrence with the approach proposed in the ESR. The Executive Summary of the ESR is&#13;
presented in Annex 3.1 1.&#13;
3.16  In the process of preparing the document, IL&amp;FS's management has demonstrated a&#13;
strong commitment to implement the ESR and taken a proactive stand for tackling&#13;
environmental and social issues. IL&amp;FS clearly sees the EA/SA process as an integral part of&#13;
its risk management framework: specific environmental and social risks are identified upfront&#13;
and mitigation measures fully integrated into the project design, thereby reducing the risks of&#13;
delays during contruction and operation that could threaten the project's financial viability.&#13;
It also enables IL&amp;FS to screen projects and avoid financing investments for which, for&#13;
example, land acquisition may result in costly resettlement and rehabilitation (R&amp;R). IL&amp;FS&#13;
has brought a few innovative features into the environmental and social assessment process,&#13;
such as the establishment of neighbourhood committees or the preparation of annual&#13;
environmental and social audits for the company. It has set an example of best practice that&#13;
might well be considered for other operations supported by the Bank in India and elsewhere.&#13;
3.17  IL&amp;FS, with the assistance of local consultants, prepared an environmental and social&#13;
assessment for the proposed Delhi-NOIDA link bridge subproject. The draft report was&#13;
reviewed by the Bank and the final version incorporates all the comments. The Delhi&#13;
Administration, NOIDA and the project SPV have all committed to implement the mitigation&#13;
actions. Air pollution and noise have emerged as the major environmental issues in certain&#13;
localities adjacent to the project location. A greenbelt, noise barriers and air quality&#13;

documents.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
monitoring are included in the project design. Five per cent of the total landfall area is under&#13;
dispute, the remaining is unencumbered land. A negotiated settlement with the affected&#13;
people is being pursued by the Delhi Administration. The compensation will be based on the&#13;
entitlement framework contained in the ESR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
IV - PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
Project sustainability&#13;
4.01  In this particular case, project sustainability must be looked at from three inter-related&#13;
angles: (i) from the point of the individual subprojects; (ii) from the institutional IL&amp;FS&#13;
viewpoint; and (iii) from a broad sectoral perspective. The proposed project will support the&#13;
implementation of commercial infrastructure projects which IL&amp;FS is and will continue to be&#13;
carefully screening for their financial, economic, technical, environmental and social merits.&#13;
Among the eligibility criteria agreed with the Bank, IL&amp;FS has set a minimum real financial&#13;
rate of return of 14% which it considers to be the minimum for attracting private finance.&#13;
The subprojects are structured to generate sufficient revenues to recover capital as well as&#13;
operating and maintenance costs through the duration of the concessions. Particular attention&#13;
is also given by IL&amp;FS for establishing an appropriate institutional framework for the&#13;
implementation of the individual projects, through a pro-active dialogue with GOI on&#13;
regulatory and legal issues and by encouraging public/private partnerships with state&#13;
governments and their agencies. Since the financial viability of the proposed investments&#13;
depends on the cost-effective design, implementation and operation of individual projects,&#13;
the incentives for sustainability are greater than in the case of similar investments&#13;
implemented by the public sector. The agreed procedures for Bank review of subprojects&#13;
(paras. 3.08, 3.09 and 3.13) should also enhance the likelihood of sustainability of the&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
4.02   With regard to IL&amp;FS's sustainability, the company has developed an Operating&#13;
Framework which inter alia sets out a risk management framework and related policies as&#13;
well as the company's guidelines and framework of operations (para. 2. 10). To ensure that&#13;
IL&amp;FS's expanded involvement in infrastructure is sustainable in the long run, the Project&#13;
includes the following safeguards: (i) IL&amp;FS's risk management framework, as revised, will&#13;
set prudent limits to the company's exposure to infrastructure projects; (ii) financial&#13;
covenants will provide additional prudential guidelines for IL&amp;FS's overall operations; and&#13;
(iii) the agreed financial eligibility criteria for onlending to individual subprojects are&#13;
expected to contain the credit risks of individual subprojects.&#13;
4.03   By supporting IL&amp;FS' efforts in the development of private infrastructure&#13;
investments, in collaboration with the concerned agencies of GOI and individual states, the&#13;
project will assist in defining an improved regulatory and institutional framework for the&#13;
sector and hence establishing the sustainability of private infrastructure investments in India.&#13;
Economic analysis&#13;
4.04   The economic analysis of the Project will be carried out at the subproject level, on an&#13;
investment-by-investment basis. As indicated earlier, each subproject will be subject to both&#13;
a detailed financial analysis and a conventional economic evaluation by IL&amp;FS, assisted, as&#13;
necessary, by specialized consultants. During project preparation, the Bank reviewed the&#13;
preliminary economic evaluations carried out by IL&amp;FS for a sample of subprojects in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
transport and water supply sectors. While IL&amp;FS's staff demonstrated extensive knowledge&#13;
of the principles of economic analysis of projects, some improvements were suggested to&#13;
enhance the coverage, thoroughness and rigor of the evaluations. The Bank agreed with&#13;
IL&amp;FS a methodology to be followed for investments in each sector, including: (i) a clear&#13;
articulation of the underlying rationale for the choice of each subproject, (ii) the consistency&#13;
of the subproject within future sectoral development plans, (iii) the identification of the&#13;
expected beneficiary groups, (iv) the valuation of economic benefits and costs using&#13;
appropriate shadow prices, (vi) the identification of the risks of the subproject and the&#13;
associated mitigation measures, (vii) the establishment of a minimum economic rate of return&#13;
(ERR), (viii) the test of first-year benefits (FYB) to check appropriate timing of the&#13;
investment, and (ix) the use of incremental analysis in the context of a phased project.&#13;
During loan negotiations IL&amp;FS confirmed that it will follow an acceptable methodology&#13;
when carrying out the economic evaluation of subprojects and that it will fully document&#13;
such analysis in the evaluation report to be submitted to the Bank for each subproject.&#13;
Benefits&#13;
4.05   At the subproject level, the project will achieve the benefits normally attributed to&#13;
specific infrastructure projects; these will be clearly identified and measured on a case-by-&#13;
case basis in the economic evaluation of individual subprojects. At the macroeconomic level,&#13;
the Project should be seen as a precursor for greater involvement of domestic financial&#13;
institutions and the capital markets in the infrastructure sector. It will help overcome one of&#13;
the major obstacles to a satisfactory market response to GOI's economic reform efforts and&#13;
promote increased capital availability for infrastructure, improved efficiency in the use of&#13;
these resources and overall faster economic growth. The Project will enable IL&amp;FS to&#13;
promote commercially-viable infrastructure projects on a much wider scale than heretofore.&#13;
By giving such investments a clear commercial orientation, the concept adopted by IL&amp;FS&#13;
for their implementation is expected to induce better cost recovery, faster construction, the&#13;
application of improved maintenance policies, the introduction of technological&#13;
improvements, better utilization of the infrastructure capacity, and better interaction between&#13;
users and providers of services. The project will also provide the company with the&#13;
appropriate institution-building and technical assistance support required to develop it into a&#13;
successful infrastructure company. IL&amp;FS will thus have become a rare institution in the&#13;
developing world, achieving what it does as a purely indigenous enterprise.&#13;
Risks&#13;
4.06   The Project -- innovative in its concept and design -- entails certain risks which are&#13;
proposed to be mitigated in the following manner:&#13;
* first, the Project is breaking new grounds. The pioneering of commercial infrastructure&#13;
projects in India in itself constitutes a key risk, particularly in the absence of a well-&#13;
established administrative, legal and regulatory regime. To mitigate this risk, IL&amp;FS is&#13;
using great care in selecting ("cherry-picking") only those projects which it considers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
commercially viable, in establishing close partnerships with local authorities and other&#13;
stakeholders, and spending significant resources in developing appropriate contractual&#13;
frameworks (e.g., concession agreements) for these projects. The Project will also&#13;
ensure that the public contracting parties will have access, whenever required, to expert&#13;
advisory services to ensure that the subprojects supported under the operation are the&#13;
result of a fair and responsible contracting and negotiating process;&#13;
secondly, BOT-type infrastructure projects are still relatively new to IL&amp;FS and raise&#13;
credit risk issues quite different from the more traditional corporate finance and&#13;
investment banking business in which IL&amp;FS has so far excelled. IL&amp;FS is building up a&#13;
core team of professional staff and has agreed to build into its appraisal process a greater&#13;
degree of reliance on outside consultants to complement its own resources. Systems are&#13;
being put in place to ensure careful and comprehensive appraisal of projects which will&#13;
be reinforced by a close interaction with the Bank and specific financial eligibility&#13;
criteria;&#13;
thirdly, there is a risk that IL&amp;FS may have set excessively optimistic targets for&#13;
implementation of the subprojects in its pipeline. Thus, embedded in the project is also a&#13;
risk of delays in disbursing the proposed loan. This could in turn induce IL&amp;FS to either&#13;
shift towards simpler and less productive projects or rush the procedures and deviate from&#13;
a proper contractual framework. A reasonable degree of conservatism has been built into&#13;
the financial projections discussed in Chapter 11. The close working relationship&#13;
between the Bank and IL&amp;FS, the proposed covenants and onlending arrangements,&#13;
including milestone provisions for disbursements, and Bank reviews and approvals of&#13;
individual subprojects should also minimize the risk of IL&amp;FS deviating from the priority&#13;
sector and project types as well as the agreed procedures. In addition, to secure an&#13;
effective role for the Bank in monitoring progress of implementation of the project, the&#13;
supervision plan provides for a significantly enhanced supervision effort by the Bank,&#13;
particularly during the first two years of project implementation. (para. 3.09);&#13;
fourthly, IL&amp;FS's involvement in a number of large and relatively complex projects,&#13;
raises the risk of too rapid an expansion of its infrastructure operations. While it has&#13;
followed until now prudent management practices, it must continue to maintain a proper&#13;
balance between growth and sound investments. The financial covenants proposed for&#13;
this project should provide appropriate checks on IL&amp;FS's growth in infrastructure assets&#13;
and future exposure to infrastructure projects;&#13;
finally, the loan to IL&amp;FS includes a new feature whereby the company will be allowed&#13;
to use proceeds from the loan account and immediately swap them into Rupees in order&#13;
to protect itself from the foreign exchange risk on repayment of the loan. Appropriate&#13;
safeguards have been built into the terms and conditions of such Special Account and the&#13;
associated Swap Account so that the funds disbursed from the loan account are used&#13;
exclusively for the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4.07  It is also worth noting that IL&amp;FS itself, as a commercial entity, is well aware of the&#13;
issues related to risks and risk management; this has been extensively reflected in its&#13;
Operating Framework (para. 2.09). The risk management framework and policies set out in&#13;
detail (i) IL&amp;FS' risk management philosophy; (ii) the objectives of risk management; (iii)&#13;
the company's risk management process; (iv) the internal allocation of responsibilities; and&#13;
(v) definition and types of risks incurred in IL&amp;FS's various business activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
V - AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
Agreements&#13;
5.01   Agreement has been reached with IL&amp;FS that:&#13;

2.07);&#13;
(iv)  any material modification to the existing regulatory framework applicable to&#13;
IL&amp;FS, that adversely affects the operations of the company, will be an event of&#13;
default under the loan (para. 2.09);&#13;
(v)  it will continue to conduct its operations in accordance with the principles and&#13;
procedures enunciated in its Operating Framework, as suitably revised, and that any&#13;
material modification to the Operating Framework, without prior approval of the&#13;

(vi)  it will maintain at all times a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 (para.&#13;
2.17);&#13;
(vii) it will maintain at all times a debt to equity ratio of not more than 6:1 (para. 2.17);&#13;
(viii) it will apply eligibility criteria, acceptable to the Bank, to all subprojects to be&#13;

(ix)  it will onlend the proceeds of the loan on terms and conditions acceptable to the&#13;
Bank (para. 3.12);&#13;
(x)  it will use the amounts deposited in the Special Account exclusively for executing&#13;
swap transactions, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, and it will&#13;
deposit the rupees obtained thereby in a Swap Account, payments out of which will&#13;
be used exclusively for eligible expenditures under the Project (para. 3.12); and&#13;
(xi)  it will follow a methodology acceptable to the Bank for the economic analysis of&#13;
subprojects (para. 4.04).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31-&#13;
5.02  Agreement has been reached with GOI that it will guarantee the proposed loan to&#13;
IL&amp;FS under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including the levy of a guarantee&#13;
fee of not less than 1.2% on amounts outstanding and disbursed (para. 3.11).&#13;
5.03  Agreement has been reached with GOI and IL&amp;FS that annual management reviews&#13;
of the Project will be carried out by April 30 of each year and that a mid-term review of the&#13;
Project will be carried out no later than April 30, 1998 (para. 3.09).&#13;
5.04  Conditions of effectiveness of the loan to IL&amp;FS will be that:&#13;
(i)  IL&amp;FS's Operating Framework has been revised to (a) set definite investment&#13;
exposure limits instead of guidelines, (b) limit to one third of its total credit&#13;
exposure, IL&amp;FS's credit exposure to infrastructure projects, as suitably defined, (c)&#13;
limit to 30% of the company's net worth its aggregate investments in affiliates, as&#13;
suitably defined, and (d) treat as equity all expenditures incurred by IL&amp;FS on&#13;
infrastructure projects prior to their financial closure (para. 2.10);&#13;
(ii)  GOI and IL&amp;FS have entered into an indemnity agreement on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.1 1); and&#13;
(iii) the security arrangements for the loan have been completed by IL&amp;FS, including&#13;
the placement of the loan under the mortgage shared equally with other lenders and&#13;
the execution of the intercreditor agreement (para. 3.1 1).&#13;
5.05  A condition of effectiveness of the development credit will be that the loan to IL&amp;FS&#13;
has been made effective (para. 3.05).&#13;
5.06  Conditions of disbursement for the investment component of the loan to IL&amp;FS will&#13;
be, with respect to all subprojects, that the Bank will have reviewed and approved each&#13;
subproject and that all contracts associated with the implementation of the subproject will&#13;
have been executed (para. 3.13).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
5.06  With the above assurances, agreements and conditions, the proposed Project would be&#13;
suitable for a Bank loan of US$200 million to IL&amp;FS, to be repaid over a period of 20 years&#13;
(including 5 years of grace) at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based single&#13;
currency loans, and an IDA credit of SDR3.4 million (US$5 million equivalent) to India, to&#13;
be repaid over 35 years.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
PROPOSED PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE (IL&amp;FS) PROJECT&#13;
Implementation of a cost accounting system&#13;
1.   IL&amp;FS has in place well-developed high-quality accounting systems and internal&#13;
auditing arrangements. Following the establishment of regional offices in Delhi and&#13;
Bangalore, the company has further strengthened its accounting system to better monitor&#13;
the operations of its various profit centers from a geographical perspective. What is&#13;
needed however is the capacity to carefully monitor the profitability of individual&#13;
products marketed by the company. This has clearly not been a problem until now as the&#13;
company has remained of a manageable size, thus enabling its senior management to&#13;
keep good track of the various business activities and their relative profitability, but not&#13;
yet in a systematic manner. As the company grows rapidly and the number of product&#13;
lines multiplies -- as is currently anticipated -- such monitoring will become increasingly&#13;
difficult. It is therefore necessary that, in anticipation of future growth, IL&amp;FS start&#13;
implementing a comprehensive cost accounting system by product line so that it is fully&#13;
operational by 3/31/97.&#13;
2.    On an annual basis, the company's statutory auditor should certify to the Bank&#13;
that an adequate system of accounting for costs per product line is in place (to be certified&#13;
as of 3/31/97). Such system shall be throughout the company for all major product lines&#13;
and shall make available to senior management, division managers and the Board (as well&#13;
as the Bank) sufficient information to determine "gross" and "net" spreads per major&#13;
product line. Such a system shall take into account overhead costs, including marketing,&#13;
product and project development, finanncing costs and other administrative burdens and&#13;
shall require the development of a transfer pricing model or other formula for appropriate&#13;
allocations. The "gross" spreads shall be before the allocation of overhead expenditures.&#13;
If appropriate, IL&amp;FS shall work with its statutory auditor or others to develop an&#13;
appropriate transfer pricing model to determine such spreads.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE (IL&amp;FS) PROJECT&#13;
IL&amp;FS: exposure limits for commercial infrastructure projects&#13;
and&#13;
limits to investments in affiliates&#13;
* With regard to infrastructure investments, credits extended to infrastructure projects&#13;
will not exceed one third (33 1/3%) of the Company's total credit exposure.&#13;
Infrastructure investments are those projects of a utility nature (e.g., power&#13;
generation, power distribution; water supply, water distribution, transport facilities&#13;
including roads, bridges, tunnels; airports, port facilities, water and air transport&#13;
operators or systems, passenger and freight handling facilities, rail systems and&#13;
railway operators; telecommunication operators, equipment and systems) which bear&#13;
a greenfield startup/major expansion risk or where the pricing of output or services is&#13;
subject to Government approval. Excluded from this list will be infrastructure&#13;
investments extended to creditworthy industrial houses where the infrastructure&#13;
investment constitutes no more than 25% of the assets of the industrial house, or for&#13;
which full and unconditional guarantees have been given by such industrial houses.&#13;
Total credit exposure will include all forms of investment which are made by means&#13;
of instruments (including loans', lease contracts, guarantees, debt underwritings and&#13;
other similar financial obligations) which are not counted as equity (as defined&#13;
elsewhere in the risk management framework). Appropriate adjustments to a credit&#13;
exposure will be made to reflect the proportion of debt service coverage met by a firm&#13;
offtake contract of a creditworthy industrial house. Compliance with this covenant&#13;
will be reviewed in its entirety annually.&#13;
* Aggregate investments (including total credit exposure and equity as referred to&#13;
above) in affiliates of IL&amp;FS will not exceed 30% of IL&amp;FS's paid-in share capital&#13;
and unimpaired reserves. For purposes of this section, an IL&amp;FS affiliate is to be&#13;
defined as an entity where IL&amp;FS's share of the paid in equity capital is more than 33&#13;
1/3%. Excluded from this limit are long-term strategic investments made by IL&amp;FS&#13;
in developing its business activities2.&#13;
including subordinated loans.&#13;
2   These include investments in the share capital of its stock-broking venture, asset management venture, auto&#13;
finance venture, Kampsax India, Transroute.&#13;

IL&amp;FS's financial forecast: sensitivity analysis&#13;
A sensitivity analysis was carried out on IL&amp;FS's financial forecast to assess the&#13;
impact of certain events on its future financial performance, as compared to the base case&#13;
scenario discussed in Chapter II and Annex 2.5. The following scenarios are presented&#13;
below. Their respective outcomes are summarized in Attachment 1.&#13;
Scenario A: (a)  commercial infrastructure assets grow at a slower pace to reach Rs.&#13;
7,923 million (US$226 million) by March 31, 2001; US$150 million,&#13;
instead of the projected US$200 million, is disbursed from the Bank&#13;
loan;&#13;
(b)  fee income increases by Rs. 150 million only over the 1995/96 figures;&#13;
(c)  no income provision is made for capital gains on the proprietary&#13;
portfolio, the size of which remains the same over the entire period;&#13;
(d)  leasing and investment banking assets are 20% lower than in the base&#13;
case through the entire period.&#13;
Scenario B: (a)  same as above;&#13;
(b)  fee income increases by Rs.65 million over 1995/96 (the establishment&#13;
of the AIG fund has already secured the receipt of such additional&#13;
income);&#13;
(c)  same as above;&#13;
(d)  leasing and investment banking assets are one third lower than in the&#13;
base case.&#13;
Scenario C: (a)  same as above;&#13;
(b)  no increase in fee income as compared to 1995/96 results;&#13;
(c)  same as above;&#13;
(d)  leasing and investment banking assets are 50% lower than in the base&#13;
case.&#13;

PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE (IL&amp;FS) PROJECT&#13;
Subproject eligibility criteria&#13;
1.    IL&amp;FS, through a specialized group called Infrastructure Project Advisory Services, is&#13;
constantly developing a pipeline of projects, which constitutes the source of future business for&#13;
its investment banking activities. The identification of potential investments is made through&#13;
permanent contacts held by the company with major actors in the infrastructure field. Their&#13;
action could be characterized as follows: (i) the continuous infrastructure needs search&#13;
conducted, on a regular basis, by relevant agencies in GOI and State governments; (ii) the&#13;
identification work being carried out by regional and local organizations, private as well as&#13;
public, which also detect deficiencies and/or identify infrastructure requirements; and (iii)&#13;
proposals raised by private groups interested in developing a certain undertaking which already&#13;
has a tentative official approval. Upon receipt of the different ideas, IL&amp;FS will screen the&#13;
identified projects, and start with the project appraisal cycle.&#13;
2.    For the proposed Bank loan, eligibility criteria (Attachment 1) have been developed to&#13;
sort out priorities for Bank lending and ensure replicability of subprojects. The latter will&#13;
simplify the processing of onlending requests, through obvious economies of scales that would&#13;
undoubtedly occur. The eligibility criteria will be applicable to all subprojects to be funded with&#13;
the assistance of the proposed line of credit to IL&amp;FS, unless otherwise agreed by the Bank on a&#13;
case-by-case basis. These subprojects would involve private investments for capacity&#13;
augmentation and/or new facilities. The criteria specify, as an illustration, the priority sectors&#13;
and give examples of the types of subprojects in each sector. They also include essential&#13;
financial eligibility criteria for onlending.&#13;

PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE (IL&amp;FS) PROJECT&#13;
Subproject pipeline and implementation schedule&#13;
1.    IL&amp;FS has identified a long list of projects in transport, mass transit systems, power,&#13;
telecommunications, water supply, sewage and effluent treatment and integrated area&#13;
development1. Some of these projects are large, like the multi-purpose road bridge across the&#13;
Gulf of Cambay connecting the eastern and western regions of the State of Gujarat (total&#13;
estimated cost when all phases are completed: US$1.6 billion), or the Bangalore Mass Rapid&#13;
Transit System involving the construction of 90 km of light rail at a total estimated cost of&#13;
US$1.4 billion. However, the more typical IL&amp;FS project ranges from about US$60 million&#13;
(Delhi-Noida bridge, Panvel bypass) to around US$200 million (Tirupur, Mangalore area&#13;
development projects). The projects vary also with respect to project preparation, with some&#13;
already reaching the final stages prior to start of construction (Panvel bypass and, to a lesser&#13;
extent, Delhi-Noida bridge), while others are still at a preliminary stage (Adityapur intra-city&#13;
link, Gujarat roads and Mangalore area development). Most of the projects are being&#13;
promoted by state governmnents. Some, for example, are promoted by a group of industries to&#13;
enhance the infrastructure facilities within and around their location; this is the case, for&#13;
example, of the Tirupur area development progran, which is promoted by the Tirupur&#13;
Exporters' Association (combined annual turnover: US$1 billion), or the Dewas water supply&#13;
project, promoted by a large pharmaceutical company.&#13;
2.    The company is aware that some of these projects may either slip or not be executed&#13;
at all, while new subprojects may be incorporated in the course of implementing the proposed&#13;
Project. The atttached indicative pipeline of subprojects form the core group of investments&#13;
identified for possible financing under the Project. It is a scaled down version of the above-&#13;
mentioned list, bearing in mind that (a) commercial infrastructure projects take a considerable&#13;
time to develop, and (b) IL&amp;FS can only gradually build up its capacity to handle the&#13;
correspondingly large volume of appraisal work. This pipeline should be considered as&#13;
indicative as further changes may occur during the implementation of the Project.&#13;
3.    The attached tables show the individual projects with a brief description, the estimated&#13;
cost, the current status and the planned construction period. Each table includes projects to&#13;
be started in three successive IL&amp;FS fiscal years, the first one covering the period April 1,&#13;
1996 to March 31, 1997. Subprojects in the 1996/97 group, for example, are quite advanced&#13;
in general and have a high probability of being implemented soon: this is the case, for&#13;
example, of the Panvel bypass and the Delhi-NOIDA bridge where IL&amp;FS is acting as project&#13;
sponsor and setting up joint ventures with other parties (contractors, toll operators) for the&#13;
Normally, it means the development of an area to facilitate industrial growth. Typically, an integrated area&#13;
development program envisages the provision of several infrastructure services such as: surface transport,&#13;
power, telecom, water supply, drainage and effluent treatment, and commercial and/or housing&#13;
development.&#13;

implementation of the projects. Subprojects in the latter two groups vary in their degree of&#13;
complexity of preparation; hence the probability of their being started within the&#13;
implementation period of the Project varies significantly.&#13;

PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE (IL&amp;FS) PROJECT&#13;
IL&amp;FS proposed training and technical assistance activities&#13;
(summary)&#13;
Training&#13;
The development of infrastructure projects typically involves three distinct phases: (i)&#13;
project identification and platning, (ii) detailed design and execution, and (iii) operation and&#13;
maintenance. Given the range of activities, IL&amp;FS needs to deliver from within its ranks a&#13;
diverse range of skills across infrastructure development and project management, including inter&#13;
alia, financial engineering, economic, legal and support functions. IL&amp;FS has formulated a&#13;
comprehensive staff development program, the details of which are contained in the project files.&#13;
In order to provide the appropriate skills to its personnel, the company proposes to have a&#13;
three-tier staff development program aimed at providing specialized training based on the&#13;
functional responsibilities of the staff. The method of achieving skill upgradation at various&#13;
levels are as elaborated below:&#13;
* Junior level: IL&amp;FS personnel would attend structured training courses, generally for a&#13;
duration of 2-3 weeks, to familiarize themselves with techniques of project development and&#13;
commercialization of infrastructure projects, mainly as a public/private partnership. Courses&#13;
would consist of classroom training and case study presentations;&#13;
* Middle level: IL&amp;FS personnel need to attend advanced courses on the formulation of&#13;
infrastructure projects as well as develop expertise in designing innovative debt instruments&#13;
and securitisation. The training program for such personnel would mainly be through&#13;
providing avenues for interaction with experienced practitioners at workshops/seminars.&#13;
Additionally, specially designed advanced courses would be delivered;&#13;
*  Senior level: IL&amp;FS personnel would be provided with an opportunity to visit projects&#13;
implemented on a commercial format and interact with major bankers, suppliers, contractors,&#13;
consultants, operators and concessionaires. Such interactions would expose them to the latest&#13;
thinking on the nature and form of agreements reached, for implementation and operation of&#13;
such projects.&#13;
Additionally, it is proposed that international experts be invited to work along with&#13;
IL&amp;FS personnel on a focused basis in areas like risk assessment and allocation, bid evaluation,&#13;
contracts and performance monitoring.&#13;
&#13;

Technical assistance&#13;
IL&amp;FS has identified a number of areas where detailed studies or focussed advisory&#13;
services would be required to facilitate the evaluation and implementation of commercial&#13;
infrastructure projects. These are, for example, legal and regulatory framework applicable to&#13;
BOT projects in sectors of IL&amp;FS's interest, innovative financing for environmental&#13;
infrastructure in medium-sized cities and townships, traffic forecasting, willingness to pay and&#13;
fixation of user charges for water supply and road projects. A brief description of the proposed&#13;
studies is provided below. The results of these studies would be used by IL&amp;FS and would be&#13;
available to others on a selective basis.&#13;
Specific Studies:&#13;
* Contractual and legal documents: The main objective would be to examine the legal and&#13;
regulatory framework applicable to sectors of IL&amp;FS interest. Additionally the assignment&#13;
would include preparation of an outline bid document to invite BOT operators. As a part of&#13;
this document, evaluation criteria for selection of BOT operator in the sectors where IL&amp;FS&#13;
is actively involved would also be included.&#13;
* Financing environmental infrastructure in industrial townships: The main objective would be&#13;
to examine innovative approaches to financing water supply, wastewater treatment and&#13;
garbage disposal as an integrated package. IL&amp;FS has initiated some work as part of the&#13;
preparatory activities of the Tirupur integrated area development project, but this needs to be&#13;
significantly enhanced. The resulting model could be replicated in other industrial&#13;
townships. IL&amp;FS will draw extensively from international experience, as there is none&#13;
comparable locally. The scope of the assignment would include: (a) literature review and&#13;
study of international experiences; (b) researching financial and regulatory instruments such&#13;
as municipal bonds, water tariffs, effluent charges, tradable pollution permits and self-&#13;
enforcement; (c) applying these in two suprojects -- Tirupur and Mangalore; (d) negotiateing&#13;
with the Government to mainstream these instruments as an integral part of municipal&#13;
financing; and (e) preparing the commercial documents for the two suprojects.&#13;
* Traffic forecasting: The principal objective of this study is to establish an appropriate&#13;
method for forecasting traffic on the road network by relating it to population and socio-&#13;
economic characteristics in its catchment area. It should be based either on a travel demand&#13;
model, or other suitable method, that allows the analysis of the relationship between traffic&#13;
volume for each type of vehicles and specific economic variables. The study would include&#13;
analysis of traffic and other information on two typical road stretches, where MOST has&#13;
already undertaken traffic counts. The study should evolve a methodology using data bases&#13;
as are generally available in the country, collection of specific primary information, and&#13;
verify its consistency on the sample stretches.&#13;

* User charge estimation - Willingness to Pay: The main objective is to determine viable user&#13;
charges based on a willingness-to-pay assessment of users. The study would cover two&#13;
sectors - water supply and roads. The consultant would be required to undertake user surveys&#13;
and relate willingness to pay with service levels and income in the case of water supply and&#13;
with respect to perceived congestion and trip purpose in the case of road users. The study&#13;
would take into account the past literature and studies conducted abroad, and suggest an&#13;
appropriate methodology for the conduct of such studies in India. It would be desirable if the&#13;
study results in the construction of willingness-to-pay curves similar to indifference curves.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE (IL&amp;FS) PROJECT&#13;
Subproject evaluation report&#13;
1.    The development and financing of commercial infrastructure projects are highly complex&#13;
operations. IL&amp;FS is expanding not only onto new grounds, but also into a demanding line of&#13;
activities, where no experience is available in India. Because of its early involvement in the&#13;
design of some projects, its extensive role in bringing them to financial close and their inherent&#13;
complexity, IL&amp;FS is compelled to set for itself high standards of project appraisal.&#13;
2.    A project report will be the document that includes all necessary supporting data, analysis&#13;
and recommendations for a proposed onlending operation to become a subproject of the&#13;
proposed Bank loan. It will be the basic document that IL&amp;FS submits to the Bank for review&#13;
and. if applicable. for issuance of the Bank's no objection for the operation to become a&#13;
subproject. To avoid duplications and possible misunderstandings, the project reports will&#13;
resemble to a large extent what IL&amp;FS will submit to its Board for project approval.&#13;
3.    Attachment I shows, schematically, the agreed content of a typical project report. With&#13;
respect to the section on "Sectoral Framework", IL&amp;FS may have a problem in covering this&#13;
area, in a comprehensive manner, in those cases where there is no official sectoral plan or&#13;
strategy, as its staff is not mandated, nor has the capacity to undertake this type of background&#13;
study. In such cases, IL&amp;FS would strive to collect as much sectoral information as possible&#13;
through meetings with government officials and lending agencies, and review of relevant&#13;
documents, and would take the results as a framework to check the overall economic viability of&#13;
the sub-projects.&#13;
4.    IL&amp;FS is adequately getting organized to prepare project reports for each case. Most of&#13;
the contents of such reports are already being covered by the company, although not in a&#13;
systematic way. As indicated elsewhere in this SAR, IL&amp;FS currently has an advanced input in&#13;
individual projects by providing advisory services to public agencies extending the concessions.&#13;
These public agencies do not yet have the capabilities, nor the financial means to develop&#13;
projects on their own in India. Thus, IL&amp;FS is temporarily filling a vacuum, but at the same&#13;
time is getting valuable experience in project appraisal. The project report, in most cases, will be&#13;
the culmination of a lot of works that IL&amp;FS will have been involved in through those advisory&#13;
services.&#13;

Notes:&#13;
The plan is prepared on a rolling basis with subprojects moving from one phase to&#13;
another -- preparation, construction and operation -- over the successive years. A&#13;
further 9 projects are expected to enter the preparation phase in FY96/97.&#13;
Tasks in subproject preparation will include the review of initial screening report,&#13;
terms of reference for studies, study outputs (e.g., detailed feasibility reports, EA/SA,&#13;
EMP, RAP, IPDP), project agreements and other legal instruments. During&#13;
subproject construction and operation, execution of construction contracts,&#13;
implementation of EMP, RAP and IPDP will be monitored.&#13;
The Bank review function will progressively reduce as IL&amp;FS develops in-house&#13;
expertise. As regards environmental and social considerations, an in-depth review of&#13;
the ESR and IL&amp;FS organizational arrangements will be reexamined during the mid-&#13;
term review of the Project. Following the review, the supervision plan may need to&#13;
be modified.&#13;

PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE (IL&amp;FS) PROJECT&#13;
Selection of BOT operators&#13;
1.    In several cases, it is proposed that the BOT operator for the subprojects to be financed&#13;
under the loan will be selected competitively, following which the selected entrepreneur will be&#13;
free to procure the goods. works and services required for the facility, from eligible sources,&#13;
using its own procedures. It is essential then that, to enable IL&amp;FS to use the proceeds of the&#13;
Bank loan to onlend to the subprojects, transparent and explicit procedures be followed in the&#13;
selection of the BOT operator. Below is an outline of the general guidelines applicable to what&#13;
should be an open and competitive process for selecting BOT operators. Naturally, the specifics&#13;
of individual subproject specifics would bear heavily on the actual application of these&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
2.     Selection of operators would normally be on the basis of price'. As such selection&#13;
involves operational and financial issues not usually faced in the procurement of goods and&#13;
therefore requires considerable effort from the operators as well as the entity in charge of&#13;
managing the competitive bidding process, it is recommended that a two-stage process be&#13;
followed that involves prequalification and selection from the prequalified bidders.&#13;
3.     Stage I -- Prequalification. This involves the solicitation of interested private operators to&#13;
construct, own and operate the subproject. Solicitation should be made through an&#13;
announcement published in the international and Indian press and also distributed to the&#13;
embassies of member countries of the Bank. Interested firms would submit prequalification&#13;
statements based on a prequalification document (Request for qualification -- RFQ) which sets&#13;
out the information required from the developers and the evaluation criteria which are based on&#13;
the operators': (a) ability to raise equity and implement the subproject; (b) the operator's&#13;
financial condition, capacity to borrow and experience in raising equity; (c) technical&#13;
qualifications, including key personnel and experience with similar technology; and (d) project&#13;
development experience, which includes development of projects of a similar nature and&#13;
experience with private sector projects in developing countries. In their response, firms would&#13;
outline their experience and qualifications as they relate to implementing the proposed&#13;
subproject. The prequalification statements would then be evaluated using a "pass-fail criteria"&#13;
approach based on the criteria set out, enabling the establishment of a short list of prequalified&#13;
bidders.&#13;
This would typically be the case for water distribution systems, waste disposal, effluent treatment plants, power plants. etc.&#13;
Variations thereon could also he used for tolls charged on road or bridge projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 3.8&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
4.    Stage II -- Selection. The prequalified operators would be required to respond to a&#13;
Request for Proposals (RFP) (bidding documents). The list of prequalified applicants could also&#13;
be published in the international press to ensure that qualified manufacturers are aware of the&#13;
subproject. The RFP would be broadly structured under the following headings:&#13;
* Invitation to prequalified applicants&#13;
* Information for applicants&#13;
*  Instructions to applicants&#13;
*  Security package and financing structure&#13;
*  Proposal evaluation and criteria for evaluation&#13;
*  Applicants' proposal and supporting data&#13;
*  Mandatory performance requirements and drawings&#13;
5.    The RFP should also contain drafts of the contractual framework (e.g., concession&#13;
agreement and other relevant documents), feasibility and investment banking report, risk&#13;
identification, environmental and social assessment reports, and management plans. The RFP&#13;
should clearly define operating requirements, evaluation methodology, technical requirements,&#13;
capital structure conditions for obtaining resources from IL&amp;FS under the proposed World Bank&#13;
loan, etc. The operators would submit their bid to develop the subproject based on the RFP. A&#13;
pre-bid meeting of the prequalified applicants could be held to elicit their comments on the RFP.&#13;
Clarifications based on the issues raised during the pre-bid meeting would then be issued to all&#13;
prequalified applicants. Bids for the subproject would be evaluated and ranked based on the&#13;
price quoted for the service to be rendered. The responsive proposal with the lowest evaluated&#13;
tariff would be selected and given an exclusive right -- for a limited time -- to develop the&#13;
project. The selected operator would be required to finalize the subproject agreements with&#13;
concerned parties (Government. lenders, etc). The second and third ranked candidates would,&#13;
however, be requested to keep their bids valid in the event the selected candidate does not fulfill&#13;
an agreement satisfactorily. The RFP would stipulate a project implementation schedule which&#13;
the selected operator would be required to adhere to and would be enforced through liquidated&#13;
damages contained in the subproject agreements. A minimum level of equity financing from the&#13;
operators could be required.&#13;
6.    Evaluation Methodology. The evaluation methodology would of course vary with the&#13;
type of subproject and service to be provided. In general, the price of the service required (e.g.,&#13;
price of water delivered) is a function of the operating efficiency and cost of the infrastructure&#13;
facility, as well as financing terms and operating regime. The concession agreement and&#13;
accompanying documents define the operating regime. The operators, in response to the RFP,&#13;
are required to quote for each year of the concession, the price for the service to be rendered,&#13;
based on prices for equipment, goods and services, as of 30 days prior to bid opening for&#13;
example. and other prices that might have already been furnished in the RFP. Based on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-&#13;
ANNEX 3.8&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
quantity of service that will have been specified in the bidding documents (e.g., quantity of water&#13;
to be supplied to the distribution system, traffic volume, plant capacity and annual energy to be&#13;
generated) and the bidder's quoted prices, the revenue stream is computed for each year over the&#13;
life of the concession. The revenue streams are then discounted using a discounting rate&#13;
specified in the bidding documents to arrive at the "averaged discounted price or levelized tariff'&#13;
which forms the basis of selection. The investors are also required, in their proposal, to furnish:&#13;
(a) details of the cost of the investment; (b); construction schedule; (c) financing plan; (d) terms&#13;
of financing; and (e) details of the calculation of the price of the service to be rendered. The loan&#13;
proceeds will be disbursed against construction costs. The developer is therefore required to&#13;
provide details of the construction cost, i.e., cost of supply, civil works and installation, and the&#13;
calculation for arriving at the quoted price. Moreover, as a condition for obtaining finance from&#13;
IL&amp;FS, the operator should be required to submit a construction contract satisfactory to IL&amp;FS.&#13;

IL&amp;FS pari passu security structure&#13;
1.    Security offered to the initial lenders to IL&amp;FS was in the nature of a negative lien on the&#13;
company's assets. With effect from November 30, 1993, security in the nature of a negative lien&#13;
was substituted by way of a pari passu security structure. The structure envisages that all the&#13;
present and future assets (except those specifically exempted) of the company stand&#13;
hypothecated/mortgaged to Central Bank of India (CBI) acting as trustee to the present and&#13;
future senior lenders. It is illustrated in the figure below.&#13;

2.    The responsibilities of the trustee are as follows:&#13;
*     Effective and valid creation of the security on the movable assets by IL&amp;FS&#13;
by way of registration of the charge with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) (other than the&#13;
assets specifically excluded).&#13;
+     To ensure that the security coverage of 1.33 times the outstanding mortgage debt&#13;
thereby secured is maintained throughout the currency of trust security.&#13;
*     Effective and valid insurance cover for normal risk and for assignment of&#13;
assurance policies or registration of bank clause thereon in favour of the trustee/ existing and&#13;
future lenders.&#13;
*     Safe custody of all original documents of title, lease agreements, invoices,&#13;
registration books and other documents of title, to ensure the due recognition of the interest of&#13;
the Agent and Trustee and the existing and future senior lenders in respect of the leased assets by&#13;
the lessees and hirers and the due noting of the creation and registration of security created in&#13;
favour of the trustee and various other matters as may be provided.&#13;
*     Issue of periodical statements and certificates by the Agent and Trustee after&#13;
due verification and various other matters as may be provided therein.&#13;
3.    Under the security structure the company is required to maintain an asset cover of 1.33&#13;
times the borrowings. IL&amp;FS has to submit to the trustee each quarter an auditors' certificate&#13;
confirming that the asset cover is being maintained.&#13;

IL&amp;FS: foreign exchange risk management and treasury operations&#13;
Until now, IL&amp;FS has hedged against foreign exchange (F/X) risk incurred in&#13;
borrowing long term in foreign exchange (from IFC and ADB) by arranging with local&#13;
counterparties back-to-back loan swaps. In these transactions, the company exchanges a&#13;
F/X liability for a rupee-denominated liability with repayment structures identical to the&#13;
original foreign exchange loan. In this fashion, the swap counterparty agrees, in a&#13;
commercial sense, to take over the F/X obligations of IL&amp;FS and directly services the&#13;
lender. However, IL&amp;FS remains the borrower on record and is liable for the loan and all&#13;
other obligations and covenants.&#13;
So far, IL&amp;FS has successfully executed three such swaps: one with IFCI and two&#13;
with the Export-Import Bank of India for F/X loans bearing maturities of 10 or 15 years.&#13;
It is currently finalizing a fourth one with Bank of India for a USAID-guaranteed 30-year&#13;
US$-denominated borrowing. Because there is no market in India for such hedging&#13;
mechanisms, loan swaps are strictly negotiated transactions subject to exchange rules and&#13;
regulations imposed by both the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Reserve Bank of&#13;
India (RBI). Arranging a swap is a relatively time-consuming process as a creditworthy&#13;
swap counterparty needs to be identified, the terns of the swap negotiated on a&#13;
transaction-by-transaction basis, and approval of the proposed swap obtained from MOF&#13;
and RBI,. Therefore, two basic conditions need to be met for these swaps to be cost-&#13;
effective: (i) there must be a minimum size to the transaction, in the order of US$20-25&#13;
million; and (ii) there must be predictability in the timing of the F/X liability so that&#13;
IL&amp;FS can manage the transaction as efficiently as possible and avoid finding itself in a&#13;
supplier's market.&#13;
IL&amp;FS will use the same mechanism for managing its foreign exchange risk under&#13;
the Project. To facilitate the execution of swap transactions, a Special Account, with an&#13;
authorized allocation of US$25 million, will be established by IL&amp;FS in a commercial&#13;
bank, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Amounts deposited into the&#13;
Special Account will be withdrawn exclusively for the purpose of executing swap&#13;
transactions; the rupees obtained thereby will be deposited in a Swap Account, payments&#13;
out of which will be used exclusively for eligible expenditures under the Project.&#13;
For the first deposit into the Special Account, IL&amp;FS will submit to the Bank&#13;
copy of the draft negotiated swap agreement as documentation for the withdrawal of the&#13;
authorized allocation from the loan account. Within seven working days of disbursement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-                        ANNEX31D&#13;

by the Bank, the swap transaction will have to be executed and the rupees thus obtained&#13;
by IL&amp;FS deposited in the Swap Account. If the swap is not executed within seven&#13;
working days, IL&amp;FS will have to refund the deposit.&#13;
For replenishment of the Special Account, IL&amp;FS will submit, not only copy of&#13;
the associated negotiated swap agreement, but also evidence of payments for eligible&#13;
expenditures made out of the proceeds of the previous deposit in the Swap Account.&#13;
Any unutilized portion of a deposit in the Swap Account, or such portion required&#13;
to be refunded under certain circumstances, will have to be refunded to the Special&#13;
Account for immediate refunding to the Bank in US dollars, using the exchange rate in&#13;
force at the time of the executed swap transaction.&#13;
It can be noted that ADB recently negotiated a loan with the Housing&#13;
Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) whereby arrangements similar to the ones&#13;
described above have been agreed and the use of the Special Account for swaps has been&#13;
permitted.&#13;

The process followed by IL&amp;FS for preparing the ESR is summarized below:&#13;
(a)   drafting of the ESR began in July 1995, as a recommendation of the Bank&#13;
preparation mission. The effort was led by IL&amp;FS with the assistance of the&#13;
NGO/Consultant -- Development Alternatives -- and guided by terms of&#13;
reference agreed with the Bank;&#13;
(b)   preparation followed a consultative process involving independent experts,&#13;
senior managers and Projects staff of IL&amp;FS;&#13;
(c)   IL&amp;FS shared interim outputs with the Bank for its comments. The Bank's&#13;
environment, social and legal divisions (ASTEN, ASTHR, LEGSA) and the&#13;
Departmental staff (SA2EI, SA2RS) reviewed these outputs. Additionally,&#13;
IL&amp;FS managers visited Washington in September and October 1995 for&#13;
consultation on the ESR;&#13;
(d)   the final draft version of the ESR was discussed with the Secretary and&#13;
officials of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) to obtain GOI&#13;
concurrence. IL&amp;FS also consulted with NGOs;&#13;
(e)   the ESR was formally approved by IL&amp;FS's Board of Directors on November&#13;
27, 1995; and&#13;
(f)   responding to the advice given by Bank management to field-test the&#13;
application of the ESR approach, IL&amp;FS also prepared the detailed&#13;
environment and social assessment report for the proposed Delhi-NOIDA&#13;
Link Bridge subproject. The report built on the previous initial environmental&#13;
examination of the project and was prepared by National Environmental&#13;
Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and AIMS Research.&#13;

ANNEX 3.11&#13;
-77-                               Page2 of 15&#13;
The ESR, as a document, is in 3 volumes: Volume I -- Executive Summary, Volume&#13;
II -- ESR, and Volume III -- Attachments. It: (a) states the company's environment and&#13;
social goals; (b) provides the contextual setting for the environmental and social assessment&#13;
process. (c) identifies the major issues in the priority sectors; (d) details the environmental&#13;
assessment and social assessment (EA/SA) process (operational procedures) that IL&amp;FS will&#13;
follow when appraising subprojects; (e) outlines methods to moderate risks and liabilities due&#13;
to environmental and social factors; (f) specifies the organizational arrangements in IL&amp;FS to&#13;
manage the environmental and social assessment process; and (g) spells out the staff&#13;
development plan. Relevant regulations, guidelines, checklists and protocols are provided as&#13;
an attachment to the report.&#13;
The EA/SA process framework is intrinsically linked to the company's project cycle&#13;
and involves the following iterative stages: (a) screening; (b) scoping, including public&#13;
consultation; (c) drafting terms of reference for the preparation of the EA/SA report; (d)&#13;
preparation of EA/SA study by subproject proponents; (e) EA/SA review, institutional&#13;
interface and public consultation; (f) translation into legal instruments of agreements on the&#13;
Environrnental Management Plan (EMP), the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP); (g) implementation monitoring; and (h)&#13;
annual environmental and social audit. The latter is a novel feature, and for the first time, it&#13;
is being employed by a financial institution in India.&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
(1)   Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited (IL&amp;FS) is pioneering and&#13;
promoting innovative approaches to infrastructure development in India. It is developing&#13;
a pipeline of commercially viable projects which includes urban by-passes, mass transit&#13;
systems, water and sanitation infrastructure and integrated area development.  The&#13;
projects are to be developed as Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) or Build-Operate-&#13;
Transfer (BOT) schemes&#13;
(2)    The environmental and social framework for IL&amp;FS has been designed to be consistent,&#13;
inter alia, with the BOOT/BOT framework. The ESR outlines the various policies,&#13;
procedures and assessments that will enable IL&amp;FS as a financial intermediary to ensure&#13;
that a project is developed in consonance with the ESR and is adequately protected from&#13;
attendant risks&#13;
(3)    Thus, the purpose and aim of the ESR is to provide the Institution an overall framework&#13;
to guide it in the identification, assessment and management of environmental and social&#13;
concerns at the organisational and at the project level&#13;
(4)    The ESR has been prepared by IL&amp;FS with the assistance of Consultants - Development&#13;
Alternatives - specialised in the field of environment and social issues. The process of&#13;
preparing this report has included desk research on the legal and institutional framework,&#13;
analysis of priority issues in the infrastructure sector, consistency checks with&#13;
operational directives of the World Bank and other multilateral agencies. There have&#13;
also been a series of discussions within and outside IL&amp;FS for the preparation of the&#13;
Report&#13;
(5)   The ESR has been formally approved by the Board of Directors of IL&amp;FS&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL STATEMENT OF IL&amp;FS&#13;
(6)   The Environmental and Social Statement of the Institution commits each project to three&#13;
cardinal principles:&#13;
(a)    Enhance the quality of life and environment in and around the project location&#13;
(b)    Prevent adverse environmental and social situations&#13;
(c)    Mitigate possible adverse environmental and social impacts&#13;
While enhancement is the first priority, incorporation of prevention and mitigation&#13;
measures will ensure minimal adverse impacts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3.1&#13;
-82-                            Page 7 of 15&#13;
(7)   IL&amp;FS is internalising this Environmental and Social statement into its business&#13;
operations through detailed operational procedures including systems for continuous&#13;
performance evaluation and self regulation. The highlights of an Annual Environmental&#13;
and Social Audit will be made public alongwith the Annual Balance Sheet&#13;
LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SETTING&#13;
(8)   The legal and constitutional setting provides the context in which the environment and&#13;
social statement and operational procedures of IL&amp;FS is framed. Fundamental national&#13;
commitments are enshrined in the Constitution of India, while the Acts, Notifications,&#13;
policies, rules and other documents issued by Central and State Governments provide&#13;
operational details. India also has obligations on environmental and social issues&#13;
through its participation in international conventions and treaties&#13;
(9)   A number of specific regulatory instruments for environmental protection have been&#13;
developed by both Central and State Governments. Many of these have a bearing on&#13;
IL&amp;FS infrastructure projects. (India's contributions to and learnings from negotiations&#13;
for international treaties have also helped immensely in sharpening the focus of the&#13;
regulatory instruments currently in place). Most States and Central Government have&#13;
either Ministries or departments of environment and forests as agencies dealing with&#13;
environmental issues&#13;
(10)  With its basic commitment to address environmental concerns in infrastructure projects,&#13;
IL&amp;FS has attempted to capture the essence of the regulatory framework in India and the&#13;
experience of the World Bank as embodied in its Operational Directives. It has&#13;
incorporated the strengths of both the World Bank operational directives and the Indian&#13;
legislation and policies in the ESR&#13;
(I1)  Compared to the more specific legal instruments on environmental issues, the&#13;
legislations, notifications, rules and policies on social issues are relatively less definitive.&#13;
While Constitutional provisions provide several guarantees to project-affected persons,&#13;
international agreements on social and cultural issues have only limited application&#13;
(12)  Given its concern for social issues associated with infrastructure projects, IL&amp;FS has&#13;
developed its policy and operational procedures based on the legal and policy framework&#13;
in India and the operational directives of the World Bank&#13;
(13)  In order to provide a benchmark for the discussion of possible entitlements in the R&amp;R&#13;
process, the ESR provides a menu of typical impacts that project affected households and&#13;
individuals may experience. Against these impacts, the corresponding beneficiary&#13;
designation and the possible entitlement options have been developed based on the&#13;
operational directives of the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3.11&#13;
-83-                                Page 8 of 15&#13;
(14)   The actual combination of types of impact, beneficiaries and entitlement options will&#13;
depend on the specificities of a sub-project itself. It would, thus, be up to the Special&#13;
Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and its sub-project consultants team to develop a coherent&#13;
rehabilitation action plan. IL&amp;FS will remain responsible for appraising it within the&#13;
proposed operational framework&#13;
MAJOR ISSUES IN PRIORITY SECTORS&#13;
(15)   While infrastructure projects deliver major benefits, the construction and operation of&#13;
each type of project involves certain activities that could have adverse environmental and&#13;
social impacts&#13;
(16)   Presently, IL&amp;FS focus in the infrastructure sector includes the following:&#13;
(a)    Integrated Area Development&#13;
(b)    Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
(c)    Transportation&#13;
(d)    Power&#13;
(17)   Specific environmental impacts during the construction and operation phase of the&#13;
project will be identified, assessed and a suitable mitigation plan evolved. The exercise&#13;
begins with the identification of issues in the alternative project sites. The degree and&#13;
magnitude of these issues are captured in the subsequent investigations (EA and SA&#13;
process). Resolution of these issues are incorporated in the project design&#13;
(18)  Infrastructure projects are also often confronted with a range of socio-economic issues.&#13;
The socio-economic impacts will vary considerably depending on the specifics of the&#13;
project location and the resettlement area. IL&amp;FS is committed to:&#13;
(a)    Fulfilling the legitimate needs of the project affected groups, and&#13;
(b)    Adopting a transparent process acceptable to the concerned stakeholders.&#13;
(19)   The salient social issues related to infrastructure projects include:&#13;
(a)   Involuntary Resettlement&#13;
(b)    Protection of Marginalised and Vulnerable Groups&#13;
(c)    Public Consultation and Consensus Building&#13;
(20)   While IL&amp;FS will aim to avoid involuntary resettlement, it may become inevitable in&#13;
some of the projects. In such cases, the attempt will be to atleast restore, if not improve,&#13;
the standard of living of the affected persons. IL&amp;FS will ensure proper valuation of&#13;
land and assets, on entitlement policy for each category of impact, minimisation of&#13;
cumbersome procedures and a well developed compensation package&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(21)   In  some  of the  infrastructure  projects, there  may  be  specific  issues  relating  to&#13;
marginalised and vulnerable groups like the economically and socially disadvantaged;&#13;
the elderly; women and children; the physically handicapped; and indigenous people. As&#13;
a general principle Il,&amp;FS will aim at enhancing their opportunities&#13;
(22)    In each project, IL&amp;FS will attempt to establish an effective local mechanism  sensitive&#13;
to socio-economic issues and capable of co-ordinating implementation of. various project&#13;
components including RAP and IPDP.  Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and&#13;
Community Based Organisations (CBOs) will play a critical role in this process which&#13;
will also redress the grievances of the affected groups&#13;
OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES&#13;
(23)   The environmental and social assessment process will dovetail with the IL&amp;FS project&#13;
cycle. It is envisaged that at each stage of the project cycle, environmental and social&#13;
assessment issues would be addressed concurrently. Based on the foregoing principles, a&#13;
summary of the IL&amp;FS project cycle is provided in the table below&#13;

(25)  The Environmental Assessment Process (EAP) will identify likely environmental&#13;
impacts and evolve relevant mitigation measures. While the project will attempt to&#13;
enhance environmental quality, it will at a minimum prevent or set in place appropriate&#13;
mitigation measures. The EAP will be undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team of&#13;
consultants with support from NGOs, CBOs, Government Agencies and due processes of&#13;
consultation&#13;
(26)  IL&amp;FS is committed to ensure that the legitimate needs of the project affected groups are&#13;
fulfilled through a transparent process acceptable to the concerned stakeholders. The&#13;
Social Assessment Process (SAP) adopted will restore the quality of life, if not improve&#13;
it, when compared to the situation before the infrastructure project. The SAP will be&#13;
undertaken by a composite team drawn from among specialists like anthropologists,&#13;
sociologists, community development experts; and others from non-governmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs), community based organizations (CBOs), project affected persons&#13;
and appropriate public institutions&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
(27)  IL&amp;FS shall establish structures that will serve to minimise many of the normal&#13;
infrastructure project risks. Nevertheless, IL&amp;FS will remain exposed to several other&#13;
risks, especially relating to environmental and social concerns&#13;
(28)  Major environment and social problems could adversely affect project operations,&#13;
earnings  and hence loan servicing obligations.  Consequently IL&amp;FS will place&#13;
significant emphasis on a rigorous Environment and Social Risk Assessment, Analysis&#13;
and Management at the project level&#13;
(29)  In order to effectively manage the environmental and social risks attendant to&#13;
infrastructure projects, IL&amp;FS will incorporate a risk evaluation process at each stage of&#13;
the EA/SA process&#13;
(30)  In essence, the risk evaluation process shall enable the Institution to develop appropriate&#13;
mechanisms to manage and monitor risks on an on-going basis. Within IL&amp;FS the risk&#13;
evaluation process shall be implemented by the project team and the Risk Management&#13;
Group&#13;
(31)  The risk evaluation process shall thus comprise of the following sequence of steps&#13;
* Risk Identification&#13;
* Risk Assessment&#13;
* Allocation of Risks&#13;
* Risk Management including mitigation measures&#13;
(32)  After the appropriate risk management systems are set in place, IL&amp;FS will ensure the&#13;
appropriate allocation of risk and the associated liabilities, through a contractual&#13;
framework and, if feasible, insurance coverage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3.11&#13;
-87-                               Page 12 of 15&#13;
(33)   Each project will have a responsibility framework outlining the extent of risk and&#13;
associated liability to be shared between each of the project stakeholders.  The&#13;
instruments through which this will be implemented, include:&#13;
(a)    Risks/responsibilities of Government      Concession Agreement&#13;
(b)    Risks/responsibilities of SPV             Concession Agreement,&#13;

\ (37)  At the project level, IL&amp;FS will ensure that the SPV/Project Sponsor appoints Project&#13;
Consultants to undertake assignments on environmental and social issues in conformity&#13;
with its business practices. Project Consultants for social issues will be selected from&#13;
among non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community based organisations (CBOs)&#13;
or public agencies&#13;
STAFF DEVELOPMENT PLAN&#13;
(38)   In order to position the organisation to achieve the objectives as set in the ESR, IL&amp;FS&#13;
will implement a staff development plan. The Staff Development Plan (SDP) is oriented&#13;
to facilitate the implementation of the environmental and social assessment process as an&#13;
intrinsic part of the project cycle&#13;
(39)   A  number of Departments in IL&amp;FS would be routinely involved in the preparation,&#13;
review and approval of the various outputs emanating from the environmental and social&#13;
assessment process. At the present juncture, IL&amp;FS staff have not been formally trained&#13;
with respect to environmental and social issues. Thus, all concerned staff will initially&#13;
undergo an orientation  programme on the ESR and its application to project specific&#13;
environmental and social issues. Subsequently, each Department will undergo training&#13;
specific to their responsibilities in the EA/SA process&#13;
(40)   Training modules will include a combination of workshops, seminars, site visits and&#13;
interactions with project authorities. The responsibility for implementing the SDP in&#13;
IL&amp;FS will vest withi the Personnel Department&#13;
IL&amp;FS - MULTILATERAL AGENCY INTERFACE&#13;
(41)   As a financial intermediary, IL&amp;FS will access funding from  a variety of lenders&#13;
including multilateral agencies such as the World Bank&#13;
(42)   In  order to  ensure  that the projects are  in  conformity  with  World  Bank's OD&#13;
requirements and business practices, IL&amp;FS shall submit the following documents for&#13;
the review of the Bank. The table below provides the institutional interface matrix&#13;

43)   It is envisaged that World Bank concurrence to the output generated at each milestone&#13;
will be obtained prior to progressing to the next stage. However, when the capacity of&#13;
IL&amp;FS is in place, it is expected that World Bank and other multilateral agency&#13;
concurrence will be required only for the EAR and SAP Summary Reports and the&#13;
agreements, prior to approving finances for sub-projects. This capacity building is&#13;
expected to take two years&#13;

            India - Private Infrastructure Finance
            (IL&amp;FS) Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Private
            Infrastructure Finance Project are to: 1) develop prototype
            contractual arrangements for private investment in the
            Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited's
            (IL&amp;FS) areas of involvement, thereby facilitating entry
            of the private sector on a much larger scale in areas
            heretore dominated by the public sector; 2) build up
            India's capacity to attract private investment in
            infrastructure, pilot-test institutional and contractual
            arrangements in a variety of subprojects under various
            administrative and political conditions, and help establish
            a track record as a prerequisite for large scale private
            investment in the sector; 3) meet the pressing needs of
            commercial infrastructure project entities for long-term
            rupee financing; 4) foster efficiency in the delivery and
            use of selected infrastructure services; 5) encourage the
            establishment of more efficient practices in the
            construction and operation of infrastructure project; and 6)
            assist in alleviating the severe financial and institutional
            constraints to the expansion of infrastructure in India. The
            project consists of three interrelated components: 1) an
            investment component in the form of a line of credit to
            IL&amp;FS; 2) a subproject preparation component, which will
            cover specialized consultancy services; and 3) a training
            and technical assistance component, which will include: (a)
            IL&amp;FS's staff development for its staff; and (b)
            specific studies that IL&amp;FS is undertaking to facilitate
            the evaluation and implementation of commercial
            infrastructure projects.
