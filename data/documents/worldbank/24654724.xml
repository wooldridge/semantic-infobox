      IEG: Improving the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Development Results Through Excellence in Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Independent Evaluation Group is an independent unit within the World Bank Group; it reports directly to the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Board of Executive Directors. IEG assesses what works, and what does not; how a borrower plans to run and&#13;
maintain a project; and the lasting contribution of the Bank to a countryâ&#128;&#153;s overall development. The goals of&#13;
evaluation are to learn from experience, to provide an objective basis for assessing the results of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work,&#13;
and to provide accountability in the achievement of its objectives. It also improves Bank work by identifying and&#13;
disseminating the lessons learned from experience and by framing recommendations drawn from evaluation&#13;
findings.&#13;
&#13;
IEGâ&#128;&#153;s Evaluation Capacity Development Working Papers are an informal series to disseminate the findings of work&#13;
in progress to encourage the exchange of ideas about development effectiveness through evaluation.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
The World Bank Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) works to improve development results&#13;
through excellence in evaluation. A key part of this mandate focuses on developing the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
client countriesâ&#128;&#153; capacities in monitoring and evaluation. To this end, IEG developed the&#13;
International Program for Development Evaluation Training (IPDET) in 2001, and this executive&#13;
training program has been implemented since then in partnership with Carleton University in&#13;
Ottawa, Canada. IPDET is managed by Carleton University but has received substantial in-kind&#13;
(through technical experts) and financial support over the years from IEG.&#13;
&#13;
IPDET was conceived to offer a one-of-a-kind learning program for filling a gap in development&#13;
evaluation training. However, there is broad recognition that the landscape is changing, with&#13;
increasing numbers of organizations providing monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) training in&#13;
some form, an evolving mix of formal graduate degree and certificate programs preparing&#13;
evaluators, innovations in learning supported by new technologies, and the growing engagement&#13;
of local networks and evaluation associations in evaluation capacity development. In this&#13;
context, IEG has commissioned a rapid review of the current landscape for M&amp;E training to&#13;
develop an understanding of the current context in which IPDET operates.&#13;
&#13;
A process of identifying and reviewing current M&amp;E learning opportunities available to&#13;
practitioners in a developing country context was undertaken to understand the current&#13;
landscape. Given the tight timeline of this study, a desk review of existing studies was coupled&#13;
with a convenience sampling approach to explore the broad range of evaluation learning&#13;
opportunities. M&amp;E learning providers were identified via citations in relevant literature, word&#13;
of mouth referrals, training announcements posted and/or archived by evaluation associations,&#13;
and broad online searches. Communication with the learning providers via email, telephone, and&#13;
Skype helped to deepen the understanding of each programâ&#128;&#153;s characteristics and history.&#13;
&#13;
Given these sampling and data collection methods, the selection of providers and programs&#13;
profiled in this summary report should be viewed as illustrative rather than exhaustive. It is also&#13;
important to note that this method focused on examining the supply side of training and learning&#13;
opportunities in particular and thus provides only indirect information about the characteristics of&#13;
or changes in demand.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, training programs focused specifically on development evaluation were of particular&#13;
interest for this review. The distinction between â&#128;&#156;evaluationâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;development evaluationâ&#128;&#157; is&#13;
arguably an important one, with increasing attention focused on what kinds of peer groups and&#13;
curriculum are needed to effectively build the M&amp;E skills and knowledge relevant for a&#13;
developing country context. For example, Ofir (2013) describes the imperative for adapting&#13;
more traditional evaluation practices and concepts to promote â&#128;&#156;evaluation for development rather&#13;
than the evaluation of developmentâ&#128;&#157; (p.584). To this end, programs must go beyond â&#128;&#156;simplistic&#13;
notions of â&#128;&#152;measuring impactâ&#128;&#153; and determining â&#128;&#152;value for moneyâ&#128;&#153; toward enablingâ&#128;¦a smart&#13;
engagement with managing for impact that ensures the capacities to achieve impacts in a&#13;
sustained manner and is based on the many lessons that have emerged from results-based&#13;
management and other similar effortsâ&#128;&#157; (p. 585).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 1&#13;
&amp;#12;The following sections of this report provide an overview of the evaluation training landscape by&#13;
exploring various types of learning programs including executive â&#128;&#156;in-serviceâ&#128;&#157; training, formal&#13;
graduate degree and certificate programs, and opportunities available through other forums and&#13;
modalities. Together, information about the offerings in each of these categories is then used to&#13;
reflect on emerging trends and the implications for developing local M&amp;E capacity going&#13;
forward.&#13;
&#13;
Executive Training Programs&#13;
Face-to-face â&#128;&#156;in-serviceâ&#128;&#157; programs are common across the training landscape, allowing&#13;
practitioners to leave their work settings for short periods of time and interact with their peers in&#13;
developing new knowledge, skills, and awareness. These in-person courses and workshops&#13;
typically integrate a range of instructional methods such as lectures, small group exercises, case&#13;
studies, and/or roundtable discussions and sometimes incorporate online interaction or exercises.&#13;
To explore the characteristics of this type of training, this review covered a sample of 58&#13;
introductory monitoring and evaluation courses and explored offerings by 40 providers on more&#13;
specialized topics for experienced evaluators. 1&#13;
&#13;
Generic Introductory M&amp;E Courses&#13;
Overall, executive training related to monitoring and evaluation most commonly focuses on&#13;
building foundational M&amp;E skills. These introductory courses last anywhere from three days to&#13;
a month, allowing participants to focus intensively on learning M&amp;E concepts with their&#13;
counterparts without having to enroll in and commit to a formal academic degree program.&#13;
&#13;
IPDETâ&#128;&#153;s Core Course provides an example of an introductory course that provides a&#13;
comprehensive overview of development monitoring and evaluation. The 2-week course&#13;
consists of 15 instructional modules, which follow chapters in The Road to Results: Designing&#13;
and Conducting Effective Development Evaluations. The generic content is relevant for the&#13;
needs of practitioners in the full range of sectors, and the program therefore attracts both&#13;
evaluators and the commissioners of evaluations from government, NGOs, bilateral and&#13;
multilateral development agencies, and the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
This type of longer generic training, lasting more than one week and offered for open enrollment&#13;
at least once per year, is relatively less common than the shorter courses. Aside from IPDET and&#13;
programs based on the IPDET curriculum, three other intensive executive training programs in&#13;
monitoring and evaluation were identified that served more than 50 participants per year with a&#13;
generic focus across sectors:&#13;
    ï&#130;§    MDF Training and Consultancy offers a 10-day Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning&#13;
         course at its headquarters in the Netherlands once per year. The training model is&#13;
         replicated for delivery independently at MDFâ&#128;&#153;s branch offices in all regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
 Many providers of M&amp;E trainings provide workshops on more than one specialized topic, so the number of&#13;
workshops is much higher.&#13;
                                                      2&#13;
&amp;#12;    ï&#130;§   The Centre for Development Innovation (CDI) at Wageningen University and Research&#13;
        Centre offers a 15-day course on participatory planning, monitoring, and evaluation in&#13;
        the Netherlands and in Burkina Faso.&#13;
    ï&#130;§   The MS Training Centre for Development Cooperation (MS-TCDC) in Tanzania offers a&#13;
        15-day monitoring and evaluation course three times per year.&#13;
These examples are shown in Table 1.&#13;

    **The IPDET training model is replicated in other similar recurring programs (e.g. SHIPDET, EPDET, and PIFED described in the text)&#13;
    ***The MDF training model is also replicated and delivered independently at some of the MDF Branch Offices (e.g., Tanzania, Ghana, Vietnam, Colombia, Bangladesh,&#13;
            and Bali)&#13;
                                                                                           4&#13;
&amp;#12;Each of these face-to-face introductory M&amp;E training programs has been offered regularly with&#13;
steady enrollment for more than ten years. However, IPDET is set apart from the others by the&#13;
sheer volume of participants it serves and the resulting class size: in 2013, the Core Course had&#13;
164 participants, nearly double the number of learners reached by any other in-person program&#13;
on an annual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Some other programs have been established over time based on the IPDET model. The IPDET&#13;
co-Directors provide training in other parts of the World based on the IPDET materials. These&#13;
programs, listed below, have no formal affiliation with IPDET:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§   Shanghai International Program for Development Evaluation Training (SHIPDET). A 6-&#13;
         day course delivered in Shanghai, China (twice per year 2007-2012; once per year&#13;
         currently, serving approximately 60 participants per session).&#13;
     ï&#130;§   European Program for Development Evaluation Training (EPDET). A one-week&#13;
         program delivered annually in the Czech Republic since 2007 that served 56 participants&#13;
         in 2013.&#13;
Programme international de formation en Ã©valuation du dÃ©veloppement (PIFED) is also based on&#13;
IPDET, but implemented independently of the IPDET co-directors. It is a two-week program&#13;
that is delivered annually in French at the Quebec national school of public administration in&#13;
Canada since 2010. The program had 81 participants in 2012 and expects to increase to 100 in&#13;
future years.&#13;
Many other face-to-face training programs exist that focus on building foundational skills and&#13;
knowledge for monitoring and evaluation. 2 Several of these have similar formats (2 to 4 weeks&#13;
long with a generic focus) but serve a more limited number of participants. Some examples of&#13;
these offerings are shown in Table 2. These smaller programs appear to belong in one of two&#13;
categories. First, there are international consulting firms, often headquartered in North America&#13;
or Europe, that offer multiple course sessions in different regional locations for small groups of&#13;
learners. An example of this type is IMA International (based in the UK), which has offered&#13;
generic M&amp;E training for more than a decade but recently developed a new 10-day course which&#13;
is offered in six locations worldwide. Although the new course served only 39 participants in&#13;
2013, the provider expects to scale up enrollment in 2014.&#13;
Second, there are small locally-based programs often situated at an academic institution that&#13;
serve participants from mainly within that institutionâ&#128;&#153;s region. An example of this type is the&#13;
Asian Institute of Technology Extension in Pathum Thani, Thailand. A three-week project&#13;
management, monitoring, and evaluation course has been offered two or three times per year&#13;
since 2006 and nearly all of the participants are from South Asiaâ&#128;&#148;specifically Bangladesh,&#13;
Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka.&#13;

Training and Consultancy (US$489), and IMA International (US$475).&#13;
&#13;
In many cases, financial assistance provided by an international development agency or program&#13;
is available to cover or help defray the cost of participation. For example, both the MDF and&#13;
Center for Development Innovation (CDI) programs are heavily supported by the Netherlands&#13;
Fellowship Programme (NFP) through Nuffic, the Netherlands organization for international&#13;
cooperation in higher education. In fact, the course leader for CDI estimated that most&#13;
participants (70 to 80) come from Nuffic-eligible countries and gain full scholarship support&#13;
each year. Financial support from IEG allows many IPDET Core Course participants to receive&#13;
needed scholarship assistance, with approximately half of the participants receiving at least some&#13;
aid in 2013. The two-week course offered regularly by the Uganda Management Institute is&#13;
heavily funded by the Danida Fellowship Programme and therefore offered to all participants at&#13;
low cost ($US55 per day for all costs including travel).&#13;
&#13;
In terms of program quality, IPDET stands out from the other programs for its consistent and&#13;
transparent efforts to ensure the quality of its offerings, as reflected by the sharing of the annual&#13;
evaluation results on the IPDET website. The Core Course is evaluated annually by an outside&#13;
evaluator using a standard evaluation framework that includes participant reactions and&#13;
knowledge tests for learning effectiveness (Trumpower 2012). Annual evaluation results, which&#13;
have been positive overall, are used to inform plans for program improvements. In addition, a&#13;
tracer study of participants and in-depth case studies are periodically conducted, with the last set&#13;
completed in 2010.&#13;
&#13;
In contrast, no other comprehensive introductory M&amp;E course identified during this review had&#13;
publicly available evaluation findings posted on their website or had published reports readily&#13;
available to share. 3 When asked to describe their evaluation methods, most programs reported&#13;
doing end-of-course participant reaction questionnaires. One provider, IMA International,&#13;
reported also following up with participants 3 to 6 months later.&#13;
&#13;
The vast majority of introductory M&amp;E programs are shorter in duration (2-5 days). Some of&#13;
these programs are well-recognized and adapted for use across the development community. For&#13;
example, the International Institute for Local Development (IILD) in South Africa plans to offer&#13;
a 5-day M&amp;E course six times during 2014 in Abuja, Washington DC, Amsterdam, Cape Town,&#13;
Singapore and Brazil. The course is modeled on the curriculum developed by the former World&#13;
Bank Institute Evaluation Group (WBIEG) and facilitated by a former WBIEG manager. Similar&#13;
content is offered by the same facilitator regularly for the Arab Administrative Development&#13;
Organization based in Egypt (with recent trainings offered in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey,&#13;
France, and Morocco) and by other providers on a more intermittent basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
 The one exception was EPDET, the program offered in the Czech Republic based on the IPDET model, which has&#13;
annual evaluation reports posted on the Development Worldwide website at&#13;
http://www.dww.cz/english.php?page=news&#13;
                                                     8&#13;
&amp;#12;Shorter introductory M&amp;E programs tend not to be as comprehensive as the programs lasting&#13;
more than one week, often covering only a subset of the topics addressed in the longer courses or&#13;
providing a more cursory treatment of key M&amp;E concepts. However, practitioners can piece&#13;
together shorter offerings from the same or different providers to create a comprehensive&#13;
executive training program.&#13;
&#13;
The Evaluatorsâ&#128;&#153; Institute (TEI), now situated at George Washington University, is a unique&#13;
hybrid example of a provider. TEI was specifically created to deliver high quality instruction&#13;
for evaluators and offers sessions for open-enrollment in the United States in Washington DC,&#13;
San Francisco, Chicago, and Atlanta. Although individual workshops range from one to four&#13;
days in length, a participant can piece together workshops for a comprehensive learning&#13;
opportunity during TEIâ&#128;&#153;s two-week summer session. Also, although TEI has demonstrated&#13;
expertise specifically in development evaluation training and collaborates with development&#13;
agencies on special initiatives, the sessions regularly held in the U.S. do not necessarily focus on&#13;
the development evaluation context. TEI enrolls a large number of participants each year (575&#13;
for 2013), but only 10 to 12 percent come from outside the U.S. Thus, with appropriate&#13;
guidance, a practitioner could gain a comprehensive introduction to monitoring and evaluation&#13;
through TEI offerings, but this program is difficult to compare to the other prepackaged options&#13;
developed more specifically for developing country contexts.&#13;
&#13;
Customized Introductory M&amp;E Courses&#13;
&#13;
Many introductory M&amp;E courses serve more homogenous groups (i.e. trainings specifically&#13;
targeting government agencies, NGOs, etc.) or are more specialized within a specific sector.&#13;
Although a systematic search by sector was not possible within the scope and timeline of this&#13;
review, the general search for general monitoring and evaluation training programs indicated that&#13;
there are introductory M&amp;E courses available for a broad range of sectors, with a prevalence of&#13;
customized courses in particular for the health sector. For example, MEASURE Evaluation,&#13;
funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), has developed a range of&#13;
regional workshops on M&amp;E in the health sector. These workshops typically serve 15-25&#13;
participants at a time and provide a comprehensive overview of M&amp;E for HIV/AIDS programs,&#13;
malaria programs, or other such areas. Examples of specialized programs for more targeted&#13;
audiences that are offered via open enrollment are shown in Table 3.&#13;

Specialized Workshops for Experienced Practitioners&#13;
Aside from introductory M&amp;E courses, in-person executive training programs also include a&#13;
variety of intermediate and advanced workshops. An internet search on development evaluation&#13;
training indicated a broad proliferation of training opportunities for experienced evaluators. A&#13;
brief review of the current and archived training announcements on evaluation associationsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
websites easily identified dozens of workshop announcements on intermediate and advanced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        10&#13;
&amp;#12;topics. 4 Selected examples from 40 providers were explored during this review, with some&#13;
examples provided in Table 4.&#13;
&#13;
IPDET is one example of a provider offering a range of specialized workshops for experienced&#13;
practitioners. In addition to the Core Course, IPDET offers 2- and 3-day sessions on a variety of&#13;
methodological and thematic topics. The Core Course or equivalent is a prerequisite for&#13;
attending these workshops, which allow participants to drill down deeper in topics of interest,&#13;
work directly with experts in the field, and learn about new approaches and cutting-edge&#13;
methods. IPDET changes the mix of workshop offerings each year (26 in 2013) based on&#13;
participant reactions recorded in the annual evaluations and new developments in the field of&#13;
evaluation. In addition, IPDET tests the interest of participants for potential new, cutting-edge&#13;
content by offering samples in mini-workshops during parts of the Core Course. The new content&#13;
areas or practices for which there is clear demand are then developed into full workshops for the&#13;
following annual session.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities for evaluators to update or deepen their knowledge and skills vary widely.&#13;
Available workshops address a broad range of topics, from performance budgeting to&#13;
communicating results effectively to the use of new technologies in data collection and so on.&#13;
However, the most frequent focus appeared to be on designing and conducting impact&#13;
evaluations. Also, the workshops on intermediate and advanced topics varied widely in&#13;
duration, but most commonly lasted for 3 to 5 days.&#13;

*Most providers of M&amp;E workshops on special topics have a range of offerings covering various topics. One&#13;
example from each selected provider is described here simply to illustrate the types of offerings available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In many cases, workshops on special topics are not just for developing technical expertise.&#13;
Ongoing, well-established training programs also work to foster M&amp;E demand as a central&#13;
objective. For example, the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) has regularly held a&#13;
flagship executive education program on evaluating social programs since 2005. The program is&#13;
offered by all of J-PALâ&#128;&#153;s independent regional offices, housed at local academic institutions, and&#13;
serves approximately 250 participants per year. A J-PAL representative explained the objectives&#13;
of the course for this review, noting that it offers an overview for people who have heard of&#13;
randomized evaluation. The hope is that participantsâ&#128;&#148;from international development&#13;
organizations, government, foundations, and NGOsâ&#128;&#148;will be able to identify opportunities for&#13;
when programs should be evaluated and that they can then participate intelligently in discussions&#13;
about the research design. The course implementers do not intend that participants would&#13;
actually conduct randomized experiments after completing the 5-day course.&#13;
&#13;
Formal Graduate Degree and Certificate Programs&#13;
Academic institutions are a key provider in the landscape of development evaluation education;&#13;
however, the relevant collection of programs and institutions is difficult to identify or define. In&#13;
a recent study in the United States exploring how evaluators acquire their skills, Dillman (2013)&#13;
concluded that â&#128;&#156;we lack both awareness of how educational experiences are currently offered&#13;
through graduate education programs nationwide, and an accepted standard of how these&#13;
opportunities should take formâ&#128;&#157; (p.280). Indeed, although prospective applicants can consult&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         12&#13;
&amp;#12;various resources to find graduate degree programs for major disciplines, there is no clear guide&#13;
to graduate training programs in evaluation. 5&#13;
&#13;
With the recognition that â&#128;&#156;evaluators are made, not born, and an extended period of training is&#13;
necessary,â&#128;&#157; LaVelle and Donaldson (2010) worked to identify university-based evaluation&#13;
training programs in the United States through an online search and curricular analysis (p.10).&#13;
Although the published research to date had suggested that the number of such training programs&#13;
had steadily declined since the 1980â&#128;&#153;s, a search on key words allowed the authors to identify 48&#13;
masterâ&#128;&#153;s or doctoral programs in total which offered two or more courses with â&#128;&#156;evaluationâ&#128;&#157; in&#13;
the course title. Given that â&#128;&#156;university programs do not appear to be in declineâ&#128;&#157; and that â&#128;&#156;the&#13;
evaluation discipline is gradually becoming distinct,â&#128;&#157; the authors suggested that future studies&#13;
might â&#128;&#156;explore the actual effects of the training programsâ&#128;&#157; (LaVelle and Donaldson 2010; p. 20-&#13;
21).&#13;
&#13;
Similar efforts are underway in other countries to understand better the available opportunities&#13;
for graduate study in evaluation. For example, the University of Bern has worked since 2004 to&#13;
identify European university-based study programs via internet searches, interviews, and a&#13;
survey. The results of these efforts include profiles of 16 European institutions that offer&#13;
graduate study in evaluation, and this list is currently posted on the European Evaluation Society&#13;
website to provide guidance for anyone seeking graduate study opportunities (University of Bern&#13;
2012; Beywl and Harich 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Traditionally, graduate programs have provided mainly pre-service education, and the enrollment&#13;
in a masterâ&#128;&#153;s or doctoral program is not always a viable choice for a practitioner looking to&#13;
update or expand his or her skills. A recent survey of 975 American Evaluation Association&#13;
(AEA) members revealed that courses related to project management, project logistics,&#13;
evaluation procedures, and evaluation approaches were most commonly completed through&#13;
professional development training rather than through graduate degree programs (Christie et al&#13;
2013). This finding underscores the need to examine other ways that academic institutions are&#13;
supporting evaluatorâ&#128;&#153;s professional development aside from the formal graduate degree&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
Postgraduate certificate and diploma programs in evaluation are becoming more common&#13;
worldwide and typically offer working professionals a more flexible alternative to developing&#13;
core M&amp;E skills than the enrollment in a formal degree program. These programs are typically&#13;
connected to graduate degree programs and require a longer-term commitment than the short-&#13;
term executive training programs. As shown in the few selected examples in Table 5, these&#13;
programs usually include a compulsory course on the foundations of program evaluation but&#13;
otherwise do not share any common format, length, or curriculum.&#13;
&#13;
Although certificate programs reflect a growing effort in the United States to formalize&#13;
evaluation credentials, the increase in programs at universities does not necessarily translate to&#13;
increased learning opportunities for evaluators working in the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s client countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5&#13;
 For example, sources of such guides for more common fields of study include Petersonâ&#128;&#153;s, the Princeton Review,&#13;
and U.S. News and World Report.&#13;
                                                       13&#13;
&amp;#12;For example, the Minnesota Evaluation Studies Institute (MESI) at the University of Minnesota&#13;
regularly attracts foreign students to its graduate degree programs due to the Universityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Comparative and International Development Education Track. However, MESI does not recruit&#13;
candidates residing outside the local metropolitan area for its Program Evaluation Certificate&#13;
program. The program has served 12-15 participants per year since its start in 1998 but has&#13;
never had a foreign enrollee. In contrast, Claremont Graduate University (CGU) typically&#13;
enrolls 14 students per year in the Certificate in Advanced Study in Evaluation program, with&#13;
half of them coming from outside the U.S. 6&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In 2004, The Evaluatorâ&#128;&#153;s Institute offered the first certificate program for professional evaluators&#13;
available entirely through off-campus intensive short courses, meaning that a working&#13;
practitioner did not need to physically attend programming at an academic institution for several&#13;
weeks or months before earning a certificate. Currently, three different TEI certificates can be&#13;
earned through coursework in addition to the Master Evaluator Certificate, which is portfolio-&#13;
based (see Table 5). Certificate programs in evaluation geared to development practitioners&#13;
have also been developed by organizations outside of academia. For example, Management&#13;
Systems International, a U.S.-based consulting firm, offers a Certificate Program in Evaluation&#13;
that is equivalent to a one-semester course at the graduate level at a U.S. university. Since 1997,&#13;
over 400 developing country professionals have graduated from MSIâ&#128;&#153;s program. Findings from&#13;
                                                 15&#13;
&amp;#12;follow-up surveys of graduates conducted in 2002 and 2007 were that most graduates were using&#13;
their evaluation skills to set up evaluation systems in their organizations or to conduct project or&#13;
program evaluations for organizations in their region.&#13;
&#13;
Regardless of the type of provider, certificate programs are steadily evolving to make use of new&#13;
technology. Most programs with a website are offering at least some courses online, and some&#13;
programs are advertising distance learning methods to reach participants wherever they are. For&#13;
example, the University of Victoria started offering the Graduate Certificate in Evaluation&#13;
program entirely online in 2010, which was reported by the programâ&#128;&#153;s graduate advisor to be the&#13;
only such program in Canada.&#13;
&#13;
Other Training Opportunities&#13;
Various other programs exist for development practitioners to learn about monitoring and&#13;
evaluation aside from in-person executive training programs and formal graduate degree and&#13;
certificate programs. Two common themes that surfaced in particular during this review were&#13;
the prevalence of programs available through distance learning or online and the growing role of&#13;
regional (or other) networks in facilitating learning opportunities for evaluators.&#13;
&#13;
E-learning and Distance Learning Programs&#13;
An increasing number of programs rely on internet technology and distance learning methods to&#13;
reach participants wherever they are. For example, the International NGO Training and&#13;
Research Centre (INTRAC) started offering a new blended learning course in 2013 that&#13;
combines trainer-delivered content (via webinar) with coaching (via phone or Skype) and action&#13;
learning over a six-week period. Examples of such programs for developing core M&amp;E skills are&#13;
described in Table 6.&#13;

The most radical example of the growing emphasis on distance learning and online technology is&#13;
that of EvalPartners, a global initiative to develop the capacity of Voluntary Organizations for&#13;

Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Organization for Cooperation in&#13;
Evaluation (IOCE), with initial funding from the Government of Finland. Under the&#13;
EvalPartners Initiative, UNICEF, CGU, and IOCE, with support from the Rockefeller&#13;
Foundation and in partnership with UN Women, started the introductory e-Learning on&#13;
Development Evaluation program in 2012. The program is free and open to all interested people&#13;
with internet access anywhere in the world. Courses are open three times a year, and participants&#13;
either choose the introductory class followed by fixed courses or they can select the 10 units&#13;
most relevant to their work. In 2012, almost 13,000 participants from 172 countries registered&#13;
(reported in http://mymande.org/elearning ).&#13;
&#13;
Efforts to increase the accessibility of and participation in development evaluation workshops&#13;
have led to a growing number of one-day offerings, which are becoming more available online.&#13;
Part of the rationale for this approach is that busy working professionals have limited time to&#13;
participate in learning activities and use of technology eliminates the costs, time requirements,&#13;
and logistical demand of travel. Some of these are single offerings provided by one or more&#13;
organizations to increase understanding in a particular area, but many of the one-day workshops&#13;
are offered systematically in batches by providers to educate evaluators on a larger scale.&#13;
&#13;
An example of this approach is the Professional Development Workshop Series in Evaluation&#13;
and Applied Research Methods that Claremont Graduate University has offered each summer&#13;
since 2004. Each workshop lasts one full day. In 2013, 22 workshops were offered spanning a&#13;
broad range of topics taught by practitioners from around the globe. Nearly all the workshops&#13;
this year were offered online as well as in-person. The workshops served 350-400 participants in&#13;
person this year and an additional 700 participants online. Participants have represented more&#13;
than 100 countries since the series began.&#13;

&amp;#12;The Growing Role of Networks&#13;
An important factor in the M&amp;E training landscape is the growing presence and engagement of&#13;
regional networks and communities of practice in providing M&amp;E training to develop local&#13;
capacity. The number of Voluntary Organizations for Professional Evaluation has more than&#13;
tripled over the past decade, from 33 in 2003 to 103 in 2013 (Rugh 2013). 7 Many of these have&#13;
websites that advertise training opportunities available to local stakeholders, and many also&#13;
become directly involved in sponsoring or developing training as part of their mission to support&#13;
evaluation capacity development.&#13;
&#13;
Programs developed by VOPEs span the full range of program types and relevant cases are&#13;
described throughout this report. For example, the Postgraduate Diploma in Program Evaluation&#13;
program offered by Himgiri Zee University in India was originally developed through the&#13;
Teaching Evaluation in South Asia Program (TESA), which was a collaborative effort between a&#13;
consortium of academic institutions, the Sri Lanka Evaluation Association, and the International&#13;
Development Research Centre (De Silva et al 2013). EPDET provides another example, given&#13;
that the program is sponsored by Development Worldwide, a civic association for international&#13;
development cooperation; the Slovak Evaluation Society; and the Czech Evaluation Society. A&#13;
few examples of recurring programs sponsored or developed by networks are shown in Table 7.&#13;
However, it is notable that many of the activities and programs sponsored by networks are one-&#13;
off or occasional initiatives rather than regularly recurring events.&#13;
&#13;
Various initiatives of the international development community aim to increase local capacity for&#13;
supplying M&amp;E training, and an example is the Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results&#13;
(CLEAR) initiative, which was launched in 2010. CLEAR is a multilateral partnership program,&#13;
and the CLEAR Secretariat is housed in IEG. CLEAR â&#128;&#156;aims to network and strengthen the&#13;
capacity of knowledge/training institutions located with partner countriesâ&#128;&#157; (Khattri and Ordonez&#13;
2013). To this end, CLEAR has established six centers at regional academic institutions in&#13;
Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and South Asia. Consultations with advisory committees in&#13;
each region â&#128;&#156;revealed a specific demand for practical, hands-on capacity development&#13;
programmes, utilizing case-based approaches, action learning, mentoring, and ongoing&#13;
engagementâ&#128;&#157; (Khattri and Ordonez 2013). CLEAR Centers are now working to increase the&#13;
local capacity for supplying these types of learning opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Networks have an instrumental role in building the local demand for monitoring and evaluation&#13;
capacity, and one increasingly common model for promoting this local demand is the creation of&#13;
a national M&amp;E learning week, commonly hosted by one or more government ministries or&#13;
agencies and developed collaboratively with the VOPE and a mix of development partners. For&#13;
example, the Ministry of State for Planning, National Development and Vision 2030 hosted&#13;
National Monitoring Week in Kenya to â&#128;&#156;to create demand for M&amp;E results and use among all&#13;
stakeholders in the public sector, agencies, and departments; and among non-state actors at both&#13;
the national and devolved levelsâ&#128;&#157; (Described on the Evaluation Society of Kenya website at&#13;
http://www.esk.co.ke/) Similarly, the Office of the Prime Minister in Uganda organized the&#13;
National Evaluation Week earlier this year to â&#128;&#156;strengthen knowledge sharing and awareness of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
 EvalPartners now reports that this number has increased to 158 at&#13;

The Changing Landscape of Evaluation Education&#13;
The selected examples of M&amp;E training spotlighted throughout this report reflect only a few of&#13;
the many programs identified during the review. These examples were shared to illustrate some&#13;
of the types and variety of programs available and are useful for exploring the current landscape&#13;
of M&amp;E training. However, it is important to note the limitations of this study before drawing&#13;
conclusions. First, the review focuses on the supply side of M&amp;E training and therefore provides&#13;
limited information about demand. Second, the search methods used were most likely to identify&#13;
those programs announced on a website or listed by an evaluation association. These search&#13;
methods therefore likely biased the findings towards international development agencies,&#13;
academic institutions, and consulting firms often headquartered in North America and Europe&#13;
rather than smaller, more locally-based programs. Finally, this review of regularly recurring&#13;
programs did not identify and include the broad range of sporadic, non-regularly scheduled&#13;
training programs and other special initiatives that development partners launch to support local&#13;
evaluation capacity development.&#13;
&#13;
Despite these limitations, the general categorization of programs and the placement of their&#13;
prominent characteristics along a timeline allows for the identification of emerging trends and&#13;
the characterization of the changing landscape. Based on these data, major and often interrelated&#13;
trends in M&amp;E training include the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        19&#13;
&amp;#12;ï&#130;§   Generic M&amp;E training. Prior to the 1990s, the evaluation of international development&#13;
    projects often relied on external international consultants, brought into the local context to&#13;
    ensure accountability. The surge in programs for broadly developing foundational&#13;
    knowledge and skills in M&amp;E coincided with the growing emphasis on developing local&#13;
    M&amp;E capacity. All of the major generic M&amp;E programs identified during this review were&#13;
    first established between 1999 and 2003. Without exception, their objectives include not only&#13;
    a focus on developing knowledge and skills but also a focus on building a local&#13;
    understanding of the value of monitoring and evaluation to foster local demand.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;§   Increased attention to the participation of civil society. Part of the demand for the generic&#13;
    M&amp;E training for a multi-stakeholder audience has been fueled by the increasing recognition&#13;
    of the need to empower and engage local civil society organizations. Organizations&#13;
    specifically targeting NGOs, such as INTRAC, have continued to scale up their M&amp;E&#13;
    offerings to build this capacity. The number of VOPEs has increased sharply since 2003.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;§   The rise of specialization. Introductory training programs on monitoring and evaluation&#13;
    appear to be becoming increasingly specialized, with many programs focusing on practices&#13;
    and methods related to a particular sector or within a specific country context (e.g, fragile&#13;
    and conflict affected states, post-disaster settings, etc.) With the exception of the health&#13;
    sector, where there is a longer history of specialization, most of these more specialized&#13;
    programs appear to have been established since 2006.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;§   Hot topics. The available education programs span a broad range of topics but certain themes&#13;
    are dominant in the roster of recurring programs listed by evaluation associations and&#13;
    listservs. Current dominant themes that emerged during this review included the use of&#13;
    impact evaluation for shaping evidence-based policy and the uses of technology for data&#13;
    collection and analysis tools. An increasing number of programs also appear to focus on&#13;
    addressing complexity in evaluation through the use of such methods as outcome mapping.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;§   E-learning. Amid continuing concern about the need to increase access to training&#13;
    opportunities for local development practitioners, providers increasingly seek to harness the&#13;
    potential of the internet. Academic degrees and M&amp;E workshops are becoming more&#13;
    available online. The OpenCourseWare concept is gaining followers and EvalPartners has&#13;
    been launched (2012) to provide learning opportunities for free worldwide. J-PAL plans to&#13;
    start offering its executive education course on evaluating social programs free online via&#13;
    edX starting in 2014.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;§   Decreasing costs. Overall, for those local development practitioners who might most benefit&#13;
    from M&amp;E training, the costs of participation remain the greatest barrier. These costs reflect&#13;
    not only the tuition fees but also the requirements to travel and miss valuable workdays in an&#13;
    organization that cannot spare any capacity. This reality drives many of the current trends,&#13;
    shortening the workshop time to reduce time away from the office, using technology to&#13;
    remove the need to travel, and specializing content to potentially address the needs of&#13;
    learners more efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
With the use of technology and broadening access to relatively generic M&amp;E content,&#13;
discussions are increasingly focusing on how to customize content for the local context and how&#13;
                                                20&#13;
&amp;#12;to effectively develop the M&amp;E capacity of local institutions. The representative from J-PAL&#13;
interviewed for this review aptly described his vision for future M&amp;E training: â&#128;&#156;M&amp;E training&#13;
needs to be for organizations rather than individuals. So the open course model now being&#13;
developed for individuals should quickly move to rapid customization--for example a course for&#13;
a democracy and governance group in USAID. When one or two people from an organization&#13;
take an M&amp;E training, there is less likelihood of a culture shift. Instead, the M&amp;E training&#13;
should be customized and part of the whole unitâ&#128;&#153;s professional development.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Despite recognized shifts and visions for the future of M&amp;E training, the evidence is still limited&#13;
as to whether e-learning or a sequence of shorter targeted workshops over time can yield the&#13;
same learning outcomes and behavior changes as an in-depth intensive program that requires&#13;
participants to exit their current work environment to learn.&#13;

            The changing landscape of development
            evaluation training : a rapid review
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Bank Independent Evaluation
            Group (IEG) works to improve development results through
            excellence in evaluation. A key part of this mandate focuses
            on developing the Bank’s client countries’ capacities in
            monitoring and evaluation. To this end, IEG developed the
            International Program for Development Evaluation Training
            (IPDET) in 2001, and this executive training program has
            been implemented since then in partnership with Carleton
            University in Ottawa, Canada. IPDET is managed by Carleton
            University but has received substantial in-kind (through
            technical experts) and financial support over the years from
            IEG. IPDET was conceived to offer a one-of-a-kind learning
            program for filling a gap in development evaluation
            training. However, there is broad recognition that the
            landscape is changing, with increasing numbers of
            organizations providing monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E)
            training in some form, an evolving mix of formal graduate
            degree and certificate programs preparing evaluators,
            innovations in learning supported by new technologies, and
            the growing engagement of local networks and evaluation
            associations in evaluation capacity development. In this
            context, IEG has commissioned a rapid review of the current
            landscape for M&amp;E training to develop an understanding
            of the current context in which IPDET operates. Finally,
            training programs focused specifically on development
            evaluation were of particular interest for this review. The
            distinction between ‘evaluation’ and ‘development
            evaluation’ is arguably an important one, with increasing
            attention focused on what kinds of peer groups and
            curriculum are needed to effectively build the M&amp;E
            skills and knowledge relevant for a developing country context.
