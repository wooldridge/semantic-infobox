1. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. OVERVIEW&#13;
1.1   The consumption of energy and electricity in Thailand has grown at high rates over the&#13;
past decade and particularly since 1986 due to the strong economic performance of the country,&#13;
arising from rapid industrial growth, and increases in exports, foreign investment and tourism. In&#13;
spite of this rapid growth, however, the energy situation in Thailand remains characterized by&#13;
relatively modest commercial energy consumption in relation to the country's development (320&#13;
kilograms of oil equivalent (koe) consumption of energy per capita compared with an average of&#13;
420 koe per capita for all of Asia). This includes a relatively high share (35%) of traditional fuels&#13;
in the final energy consumption. The primary commercial energy supply is projected to grow at&#13;
an average annual rate of about 8.0% over the next four years (1997-2000) and then at about&#13;
5.7% for the next decade.&#13;
1.2   While much of the energy growth in the early 1980s was met by imports, efforts in the&#13;
1980s to promote the development of indigenous energy resources had a visible impact on the&#13;
pattem of commercial energy consumption: the share of oil fell from about 90% of total primary&#13;
commercial energy in 1980 to about 70% in 1990. During that period, the shares of indigenous&#13;
lignite and natural gas grew steadily, reaching 10% and 16%, respectively, by 1990. Due to&#13;
Govermment's continuing efforts, the share of imported oil is anticipated to fall further to about&#13;
60% by the year 2005; it is, however, unlikely to decline below that level. A major increase in the&#13;
consumption of imported coal (mostly for power generation) is projected in the late 1990s, and&#13;
coal is expected to attain a share of 8% of primary energy consumption after the year 2001.&#13;
1.3   The sectoral composition of energy demand has been marked by a progressive increase in&#13;
the share of the transport sector, which grew 11% p.a. through the 1980s and by 1990 accounted&#13;
for 70% of petroleum products consumption. Electricity consumption has increased faster than&#13;
energy consumption as a whole, averaging 14% p.a. in the last three years. As a result, the share&#13;
of electricity in final commercial energy consumption grew from 11% to 15% in the 1980s, with a&#13;
similar increase in the share of electricity in primary energy use from 7% to 11%.&#13;
B. ENERGY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.4   The energy sector in Thailand is operated by a number of well-managed and mature public&#13;
institutions. There are numerous energy-related agencies, spreading across many ministries and&#13;
include several cabinet level committees.  Energy policy and planning is vested in key&#13;
govemmental organizations. At the highest level is the National Energy Policy Council (NEPC)&#13;
which is chaired by the Prime Minister. The National Energy Policy Office (NEPO), the&#13;
secretariat to NEPC, acts as its operating arm, and functions primarily as a link between NEPC&#13;
and the country's energy state enterprises and conducts all energy policy work. NEPO is the de&#13;
facto regulator of the energy sector. Other departments involved in energy affairs are: (a) the&#13;
Department of Mineral Resources, responsible for assessing and preliminary exploration of the&#13;
country's coal and petroleum reserves; (b) the Department of Energy Development and&#13;
Promotion, which conducts research and development and monitors energy sector activities; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
(c) the Department of Industrial Works, responsible for controlling industrial air and water&#13;
pollution.&#13;
1.5   Energy state enterprises enjoy a large degree of autonomy in the conduct of day-to-day&#13;
operations; however, they are subject to strict government control in all matters relating to&#13;
investment planning and financing. Because of strict procedures for controlling public debt, all&#13;
loans made by energy state enterprises requiring government guarantees must be approved by the&#13;
National Debt Policy Committee and the Cabinet. While many of these enterprises still lack&#13;
financial discipline and autonomy or suffer from cumbersome personnel policies, they are now in&#13;
the process of undergoing a major restructuring of their organizations through corporatization,&#13;
with a view to privatization.&#13;
1.6   The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)-the dominant entity in the petroleum&#13;
sector-is involved in downstream oil and gas activities; upstream activities are carried out by the&#13;
private sector. PTT is responsible, inter alia, for the purchase, transport, processing and sale of&#13;
natural gas. However, PTT competes with international oil companies and has a third of the&#13;
market share in the distribution and marketing of oil.&#13;
1.7   The power sector is primarily organized around three wholly-owned state enterprises.&#13;
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is the major producer of electricity and&#13;
is also responsible for developing and dispatching the bulk-power high voltage transmission&#13;
system. EGAT has the authority to purchase electricity from co-generators or other private&#13;
sources for distribution over the grid. The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the&#13;
Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) own the distribution systems and some subtransmission&#13;
facilities. MEA and PEA distribute electricity purchased from EGAT to the Bangkok&#13;
metropolitan area and the rest of the country, respectively.  Highlights of their respective&#13;
operation are provided in Annex 1.&#13;
C. THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
Electricity Demand&#13;
1.8   The power sector in Thailand has grown at a rapid pace over the past two decades. The&#13;
electricity market growth is among the highest in the world and has been fueled by the country's&#13;
high economic growth rate. Considerable progress has been made in making electricity widely&#13;
available, especially in provincial urban areas. Industrial consumption has also been growing&#13;
rapidly.&#13;
1.9   The latest demand forecast made by the national Load Forecast Subcommittee (composed&#13;
inter alia of NEPO, EGAT, MEA and PEA) takes into consideration the recent slowing down of&#13;
the economy and envisages continued but moderate load growth rates commensurate with the&#13;
expected economic performance. Base case demand growth rates for EGAT, MEA (Annex 2)&#13;
and PEA for the Seventh (1992-1996), Eighth (1997-2001) and Ninth Plan (2002-2006) periods&#13;
are summarized in Table 1.1. These growth rates are considered to be reasonable and achievable.&#13;
In 1994, Thailand electricity demand was 10,709 MW. The demand is forecast to increase to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
13,637 MW by the end of 1996, to 19,899 MW by the end of 2001, to 26,392 MW by the end of&#13;
2006 and to 34,509 MW by the end of 2011.&#13;

System Losses and Reliability&#13;
1.10  Total losses in the system were approximately 7.7% of total power generated in 1995,&#13;
down from the 1994 level of 8.6%. The level has fallen in recent years as problems with power&#13;
line upgrades have been resolved.  About 3.2%  of electricity generated has been lost in&#13;
transmission lines and transformers in 1995, better than the 1994 level of 4.1%. Distribution&#13;
losses as a percentage of power received were about 4.5% for MEA and 6% for PEA, an&#13;
achievement by both organizations which ranks with the best performing power utilities in Asia.&#13;
With the ever increasing demands placed on the distribution networks of both PEA and MEA, the&#13;
reliability of both these networks have been deteriorating substantially over the last few years.&#13;
Under the guidance of a "Reliability Committee" chaired by NEPO, several comprehensive&#13;
reliability studies have been undertaken by consultants. Implementation of the recommendations&#13;
of these studies, feature in the Eighth Plan investments of both MEA and PEA. Agreement was&#13;
reached at negotiations that MEA would contain its system losses at current levels (not to exceed&#13;
5%), and in consultation with the Bank, take any additional measures that would be called for to&#13;
meet this requirement.&#13;
Thailand's Power Development Plan&#13;
1.11  Meeting increased load demand and improving the electricity transmission and distribution&#13;
systems will require considerable investment, estimated at about B 429 billion under the Eighth&#13;
Plan. For a long-term profile up to the year 2011, the Power Development Plan (PDP)&#13;
recommends the installation of 33,676 MW of new generating capacity, net of the retirement of&#13;
2,747 MW of existing power plants. By September 2011, the sector's total capacity will be&#13;
43,918 MW comprising of 11% hydro, 25% conventional oil/gas fired, 7% lignite-fired, 11%&#13;
imported coal-fired, 10% combined cycle, 8% gas turbine, and 28% from independent power&#13;
producers (IPPs). EGAT's PDP has incorporated the Govemment's privatization program for the&#13;
power sector which includes the selling of EGAT's power plants at Rayong and Khanom to&#13;
EGAT's first subsidiary company, the Electricity Generating Company Ltd. (EGCO), and the&#13;
power purchases from IPPs.&#13;
MEA's Investment Program&#13;
1.12  Investments by MEA over the Eighth Plan (1997-2001) (see Table 1.2) amounts to about&#13;
Baht 57 billion (US$2.2 billion). Almost 24% of this program would be devoted to maintaining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
and improving the supply reliability. This would result in an annual saving of about 7.2 Gwh in&#13;
"unsupplied energy" (valued at almost US$16 million) from the year 2002 onwards.  A fair&#13;
portion of the investment program would also be devoted to improving the environrnental and&#13;
safety aspects of the system (including conversion to underground distribution in congested areas&#13;
of Bangkok). MEA's investment plan, which is appropriate to the present circumstances, will be&#13;
updated regularly to reflect changes in the amount and geographical location of power demand.&#13;
Agreement was reached during negotiations that MEA would carry out an annual review and&#13;
update of its five-year investment program, discuss this with the Bank, and implement the&#13;
program taking into consideration the Bank's comments.&#13;

D. POWER SECTOR REFORM&#13;
1.13  Power sector reform in Thailand began in 1992 with the issuance of the seventh National&#13;
Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP). The seventh NESDP which covers the period&#13;
1992-96, led to the development of a Cabinet resolution for power sector reform providing&#13;
indicative targets for restructuring, corporatization and privatization in the power sector. The&#13;
main objectives of this resolution are to: (a) reduce the investment and debt burden of the&#13;
Government; (b) promote private sector participation in the power sector through IPPs; (c)&#13;
encourage the operation of power utilities as commercial organizations with increased efficiency&#13;
and flexibility; and (d) utilize energy resources efficiently. Progress towards achieving all these&#13;
objectives over the last four years has been substantive. Despite the slippage of some targets in a&#13;
few instances, many of the reform goals specified in this seventh NESDP have been achieved or&#13;
are in advanced stages of implementation. Commitment to continued reform is also clearly in&#13;
evidence.&#13;
1.14  The Bank's operational involvement in the Thai power sector has continuously provided&#13;
inputs to the country's power sector reform process. Government strategy and implementation&#13;
have been in conformance with Bank policies and the recommendations for the sector as detailed&#13;
in the Bank's study-"State Enterprise: Improvement, Privatization and Private  Sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Participation" (Report No. 1312-TH). The main elements of the reform strategy and future&#13;
implementation issues discussed below indicate the success of the Thai power reform effort in&#13;
meeting stated objectives.&#13;
Sector Restructuring&#13;
(a)   In February 1996, NEPO submitted and obtained approval by the Cabinet for a&#13;
medium-term structure for the Electricity Supply Industry. This structure shown&#13;
in Annex 3 propounds the formation of a central purchasing agency, a business&#13;
unit comprising the EGAT transmission system and hydro power plants. The&#13;
thermal plants under EGAT will be converted to three independent business units&#13;
by end-1997 and will sell power to EGAT's transmission business unit on the basis&#13;
of transparent power sales contracts. The generation business units are proposed&#13;
to be subsequently corporatized and privatized.&#13;
(b)   All sales of bulk electricity from EGAT (transmission company) to the distribution&#13;
companies PEA and MEA will be based on an efficient bulk supply tariff (BST).&#13;
The existing bulk tariff has in-built cross-subsidies as the tariff policy has required&#13;
that retail electricity sales by MIEA and PEA be priced uniformly throughout the&#13;
country. EGAT's differential tariffs to MEA and PEA have been the vehicle of&#13;
subsidization for the rural areas. It has been the Government's intention to&#13;
eliminate the cross subsidy from EGAT's tariffs. A Study on the Rationalization&#13;
of Bulk Supply Tariff to MEA and PEA was undertaken with Bank financing&#13;
under the Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project (Loan 3884-TH). The study&#13;
provides the basis for a more efficient BST structure and a means for regulating&#13;
the power sector entities. NEPO expects the revised bulk tariff structure to be&#13;
introduced by end- 1997.&#13;
Enterprise Reform&#13;
1.15  As part of a broader strategy of public enterprise reform in Thailand, the power sector&#13;
enterprises are being restructured to operate more like commercial enterprises. A strategy of&#13;
phased commercialization and corporatization is being followed. The objective is eventual&#13;
privatization. EGAT, MEA and PEA are each at different stages in this process.&#13;
(a)   The Government has established performance targets for enterprises in different&#13;
sectors that allow them to be classified as an excellent state enterprise. In the case&#13;
of the power sector, classification as an excellent state enterprise status requires:&#13;
(a) return on revalued assets greater than 6%; (b) labor cost below 20% of total&#13;
costs; and (c) annual productivity increases equal to or greater than 2%.&#13;
Achievement of the excellent state enterprise status provides management with the&#13;
authority to devise and implement a suitable staffing and compensation system.&#13;
EGAT achieved excellent state enterprise status in 1995. This step has had a&#13;
major impact in improving management incentives and is crucial to achieving a&#13;
smooth transition to a commercial operating status. Both PEA and MEA expect&#13;
to achieve this status in 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
(b)   Following an independent "audit" of EGAT under the Second Power System&#13;
Development Project (Loan 3138-TH), EGAT obtained government approval for&#13;
its organizational restructuring plans in February 1996. These plans are now being&#13;
implemented. EGAT has created six business units (i.e. profit centers), and five&#13;
operating units (i.e. cost centers). The business units are: thermal generation;&#13;
transmission; engineering; construction; mining and maintenance. The operating&#13;
units are: governor's office and internal audit; hydro power plants; administration;&#13;
accounting and finance; policy and planning and new business ventures. Asset&#13;
restructuring for the creation of profit centers is in progress. All transactions&#13;
between business units will be conducted on the basis of transparent transfer&#13;
prices. Once this structure is developed on a sound commercial footing, the&#13;
business units will be corporatized and then could either be wholly- or partially-&#13;
privatized. The progress on privatization will depend on the absorptive capacity of&#13;
domestic capital markets.&#13;
(c)   Following the preparation of a PEA Privatization Implementation Program under&#13;
the Distribution System Reinforcement Project (Loan 3138-TH), PEA prepared a&#13;
corporate restructuring action plan. The PEA action plan has been approved by&#13;
the Cabinet and is currently under implementation under the Distribution&#13;
Automation and Reliability Improvement Project (Loan 4067-TH). PEA will be&#13;
transformed over a 4-5 year period from a centrally controlled government agency,&#13;
to regionally decentralized corporate subsidiaries under a holding company&#13;
structure. Following an "audit" of MEA's institution under the Distribution&#13;
System and Energy Efficiency Project (Loan 3598-TH), MEA has recently&#13;
prepared an organizational restructuring plan in consultation with the Bank and&#13;
this plan is acceptable to NEPO. It is expected that MEA would follow a phased&#13;
reorganization strategy, first becoming a state holding company with separate&#13;
subsidiaries and profit centers. The separation of "supply" and "distribution"&#13;
would be a major step forward in the separation of distribution accounts and for&#13;
wholesale choice by large consumers.&#13;
Power Sector Regulation&#13;
(a)   In June 1996, the Cabinet agreed on two key principles for regulatory reform in&#13;
the power sector. First, the concept of independent regulation for the sector has&#13;
been accepted. This will begin with the separation of the policy and regulatory&#13;
functions of NEPO  and the creation of a separate unit with regulatory&#13;
responsibility. Second, the basis for tariff regulation will ensure that power sector&#13;
enterprises meet a minimum self-financing ratio (SFR) of 25%. SFR would be the&#13;
governing financial covenant for regulation in lieu of a rate-of-return on assets. A&#13;
large part of this work was completed under the study on the Rationalization of&#13;
Bulk Supply Tariff undertaken with Bank financing under the Lam Takhong Pump&#13;
Storage Project (Loan 3884-TH).  The detailed sector regulation principles&#13;
concerning investment, tariffs, and service standards will be defined under a&#13;
subsequent study on Regulation in the Energy Sector being initiated under the&#13;
Distribution Automation and Reliability Improvement Project (Loan 4067-TH).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
(b)   The regulatory principles developed by NEPO have been submitted for Cabinet&#13;
review and approval. In parallel, NEPO has also issued draft service performance&#13;
standards to the power enterprises (i.e. EGAT, MEA and PEA). The power&#13;
enterprises have begun to develop and revise their long-term investment plans and&#13;
prepare financial projections to meet these service standards. Discussions on these&#13;
financial projections and service standards will continue between the utilities and&#13;
NEPO. It is expected that the performance standards and financial projections will&#13;
be agreed upon by end- 1997, whereafter formal regulatory supervision will&#13;
commence.&#13;
Private Sector Participation&#13;
(a)   Asset Divestiture: In 1992, EGAT established EGCO as its subsidiary company&#13;
with an issued share capital of Baht 100 million divided into 10 million shares of&#13;
Baht 10 each. On September 30, 1993, EGAT held the entire equity with the&#13;
exception of 15 shares which were issued to EGAT senior management to comply&#13;
with the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) regulations. In 1994, a further 186&#13;
million shares of Baht 10 each were issued, all of which are held by EGAT except&#13;
for one million held by the Thai Property Crown Bureau and which increased&#13;
EGAT's total holding to almost 192 million shares. In addition to the flotation of&#13;
additional shares by EGCO during the year, it also set up its own subsidiary, the&#13;
Rayong Electricity Generating Company (REGCO). In November 1994, a public&#13;
offering of 204 million shares in EGCO raised Baht 4.5 billion. Presently, 58% of&#13;
EGCO is publicly listed, EGAT holds 41% of the equity and the Property Crown&#13;
Bureau the remaining 1%.&#13;
(b)   Small Power Producers (SPPs) and Co-Generation: The first step taken by the&#13;
Government towards increasing private sector participation was allowing co-&#13;
generators and SPPs to sell power to EGAT. In 1994, a co-generation agreement&#13;
was signed with a private company to bring on line a new 60 MW facility.&#13;
Currently, there are 20 SPPs with a total installed capacity of 669 MW mostly&#13;
utilizing traditional fuels such as bagasse, rice husk, wood, etc.&#13;
(c)   Independent Power Producers (IPPs):  To meet the ever increasing power&#13;
requirements, Thailand launched the world's largest competitive IPP solicitation&#13;
program. EGAT announced the first request for proposals on December 15, 1994&#13;
to purchase 5,000 MW from IPPs to the year 2002. As of December 1996, 104&#13;
registered IPPs/bidders have formed into 32 consortia and have submitted 50 IPP&#13;
proposals totaling 39,067 MW. Contracts are currently being finalized with about&#13;
seven developers.&#13;
E. DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT AND ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION&#13;
1.16  While pursuing a large power development program, the Govemment has planned a thrust&#13;
towards energy conservation. The Bank has played a pioneering role in the development of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Thailand's demand-side management (DSM) program, supported by the Global Environmental&#13;
Facility (GEF) under the Distribution System and Energy Efficiency Project (Loan 3598-TH).&#13;
This program has a four-pronged approach: (a) provision of user and manufacturer incentives and&#13;
consumer education to direct practices and attitudes toward energy efficient technologies; (b)&#13;
development of efficiency standards and testing capabilities to exercise control and monitor&#13;
efficiency improvements; (c) development and promulgation of building and appliance codes to&#13;
allow for the enforcement of minimum standards; and (d) continued pursuit of technological&#13;
improvements and adaptation to Thai conditions. This program is progressing very well and is&#13;
recognized as the most comprehensive program of its kind in East Asia. The current demand&#13;
savings target of about 1,100 MW over the next five years, substantially exceeds the original&#13;
target of about 300 MW. However, the DSM program is currently being exclusively managed by&#13;
EGAT, MEA having no expertise in this field. Introducing DSM capabilities in MEA, deepening&#13;
the DSM focus to Thailand's most rapidly growing area, is planned under the proposed project&#13;
(para. 3.4).&#13;
F. ENVIRONMTENT&#13;
1.17  In the last few years, the Government has placed a strong emphasis on environmentally&#13;
sound and sustainable development. Its 1992 Energy Conservation Promotion Act, created an&#13;
Energy Conservation Fund, financed by surcharges on petroleum products and electricity. The&#13;
Act provides for a rigorous enforcement of energy conservation in factories and buildings. The&#13;
Environmental Quality Act of 1992: (a) substantially reorganized the environmental bureaucracy&#13;
making it more responsive to environmental protection needs; (b) established a Central&#13;
Environmental Fund for concessional financing of environmental projects by the private and&#13;
public sectors; and (c) recognized for the first time the importance of involving Non-&#13;
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in development. Gaining from its experience under the&#13;
Third Power System Development Project (Loan 3423-TH), the Government has increasingly&#13;
emphasized involvement of affected people and selected NGOs in environmentally sensitive&#13;
projects and formalized this in the evaluation of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).&#13;
G. BANK LENDING FOR THE SECTOR&#13;
Experience with Past Loans&#13;
1.18 The Bank has made 25 loans to Thailand for power, of which 18 have been made to&#13;
EGAT, six to PEA and one to MEA. Of the 18 loans to EGAT, 17 have been fully disbursed and&#13;
the only on-going project is the Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project (Loan 3884-TH, signed on&#13;
September 8, 1995). Three of the loans to PEA have been fully disbursed; while the rest are&#13;
under supervision. The overall progress in the implementation of MEA's Distribution System and&#13;
Energy Efficiency Project (Loan 3598-TH) is satisfactory and about 90% of the work is now&#13;
completed. Under this loan, two studies were completed: (a) an "audit" of MEA's institution&#13;
which helped identify the entity's weaknesses and strengths and will underpin MEA's&#13;
organizational restructuring under the proposed project; and (b) Safety and Environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Considerations in System Design-whose recommendations are already under implementation by&#13;
MEA.&#13;
1.19  The design and procurement delays experienced in the earlier stages of MEA's project&#13;
have emphasized the need for: (a) early procurement of land for substations; and (b) advance&#13;
preparation of bid documents.  The proposed project addresses these issues through:  (a)&#13;
sufficiently advanced action having been taken by MEA in securing land for the substations (all&#13;
land is already available); and (b) issuing of the first lot of bid documents.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.20  Among the priority areas for Bank assistance identified in the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
discussed by the Board on September 24, 1994, the development of physical infrastructure and&#13;
improvement in environmental management rank very high. These are also the priorities of the&#13;
Government and it has frequently reiterated the importance of Bank involvement and the weight it&#13;
attached to the Bank's technical assistance and operational support. Along with a modest level of&#13;
borrowing, the Government is keen to continue this involvement so as to elaborate and implement&#13;
strategies that have been launched with assistance from the Bank. The Bank's operational&#13;
involvement will help assure that the momentum of reform is maintained and the sector evolves in&#13;
an economically efficient, financially sound and environmentally sustainable manner. Already,&#13;
during the preparation of the proposed project, the Bank has been instrumental in: (a) MEA&#13;
developing a plan for restructuring its organization in a manner that has been accepted by NEPO;&#13;
and (b) encouraging MEA to proceed with DSM related work. Under the proposed project the&#13;
Bank would be assisting MEA in its efforts towards commercialization and corporatization as well&#13;
as becoming an important player in DSM, in spite of having no past experience in this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. THE BORROWER&#13;
2.1   The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) is a state enterprise wholly owned by the&#13;
Kingdom of Thailand. It was established in July 1958 under the Metropolitan Electricity&#13;
Authority Act. MEA is responsible for the distribution of electricity in the Bangkok metropolis&#13;
and the adjoining provinces of Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan. Its current service area covers&#13;
about 3,200 square kilometers with a population of about 7.3 million people. MEA supplies&#13;
about 1.8 million industrial, commercial and domestic consumers. Although originally MEA also&#13;
generated electricity, its power generation function was transferred in September 1961 to what is&#13;
now the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), which now supplies bulk power to&#13;
MEA.&#13;
A. INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
2.2   MEA is accountable to the Government through the Ministry of Interior. Policy control is&#13;
exercised through a Cabinet-approved Board of Directors composed of 14 members, including the&#13;
Permanent Secretary of Interior as Chairman and the Governor of MEA in an ex-officio capacity.&#13;
The Board, which meets monthly, operates with limited autonomy in a regulated environment:&#13;
government approvals and clearances are required on matters such as the investment program,&#13;
annual capital budget, borrowing, pricing, organizational structure, appointment of senior staff,&#13;
and major procurement decisions.&#13;
2.3   The original organization structure of MEA was based on a functional design, with clear&#13;
division of responsibilities and authority and a clear chain of command running from top to&#13;
bottom. Over the years, the organization structure (Chart 1) has evolved and developed in&#13;
response to continuing changes in MEA's external and internal environments. The growth in the&#13;
volume of electricity sales, increased number of customers and changes in office systems have&#13;
given rise to the establishment of new districts, the development of additional administrative and&#13;
control procedures in Head Office departments, and increases in staffing in most units of the&#13;
organization. MEA's desire to create new promotional positions to solve staff morale, retain key&#13;
staff, reward superior performance and avoid loss of successful staff to the private sector also led&#13;
to new sections, new divisions and even new departments. As a result, MEA's organizational&#13;
structure, which prior to October 1, 1996 had 26 functional departments at Head Office and more&#13;
than 240 individual sections, had become fragmented and complex.&#13;
2.4   Since inception, MEA has operated in close proximity to the Government and its&#13;
departments. As a result, MEA has developed a bureaucratic culture. Creativity, risk taking, and&#13;
professional and personal growth, particularly amongst younger professionals, are discouraged,&#13;
the responsibility for achievement of results is diffused and managers experience little sense of&#13;
personal accountability. The introduction of a business culture in all of its organizational levels is&#13;
necessary in order for MEA to move from an activity-oriented to a result-oriented management.&#13;
A consultant study (in association with Bank's Loan 3598-TH) has recommended the&#13;
development of a new business culture in which: (a) risk is balanced against cost; (b) managers at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
all levels are involved and participate fully in the overall management process; and (c)&#13;
management and staff are committed to the effective achievement of MEA objectives. With the&#13;
increasingly complex tasks that MEA would be facing in: (a) evolving an efficient distribution&#13;
network in a difficult environment; (b) improving the safety, reliability and environmental&#13;
acceptability of its operations; and (c) positioning itself towards achieving an excellent state&#13;
enterprise status with subsequent commercialization and corporatization, it is imperative that&#13;
MEA takes urgent steps to introduce a business culture into its organization and operate as a&#13;
commercial company. MEA management has embraced the need for a change in its business&#13;
culture and is now engaged in organizational restructuring to fall in line with modern management&#13;
practice. In this effort, it would need substantial technical assistance and advice.&#13;
Staffing and Resource Management&#13;
2.5    MEA's management and staff are professional and well-qualified. As of June 1996, the&#13;
total number of MEA employees is 12,974, down from the level of 13,220 at the end of FY95.&#13;
The total number of staff has been steadily dropping since FY93. The average age of the staff is&#13;
41 years old. About a third of the staff have received some form of higher education. MEA's&#13;
staff composition and educational qualifications are presented in Table 3. 1.&#13;

2.6    While MEA is over staffed particularly in the clerical and administrative areas, there is a&#13;
shortage of professional engineers and information technology personnel, which if not rectified&#13;
could cause serious problems for the company. The reason for the shortages is the inability of&#13;
MEA to attract and retain such staff because of the existing salary structures. There is also a&#13;
problem in retaining engineers due to dissatisfaction with the nature of their work. Many feel that&#13;
the tasks assigned to them are undemanding and inappropriate to a professionally qualified&#13;
engineer. MEA has completely halted all recruitment of every category of staff, apart from&#13;
engineers and except for specific skills not available in MEA nor capable of being developed in&#13;
existing staff in the short term. As part of its human resource development strategy MEA is&#13;
developing a plan for retaining engineers and a broadly based redeployment plan setting out&#13;
programs for transferring and retraining existing employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Training&#13;
2.7   MEA's Human Resource Development Department (HRD) has a very active program of&#13;
courses covering management, technical and administrative categories. The various courses are&#13;
derived from HRD Department's Five Year Training Plan which is reviewed and updated annually&#13;
in accordance with the organization training needs.  The Training Plan reflects managers&#13;
assessment of their staff's training needs and HRD professional training staff's evaluation of the&#13;
organization's requirements. Within the Training Plan, courses are provided internally by HRD&#13;
staff, assisted by experts from technical departments, and externally by availing of the services of&#13;
commercial training agencies, local universities, and overseas training programs. As MEA is now&#13;
entering a new phase of developing into a excellent state enterprise, it has started to refocus its&#13;
training and development activities. To make a successful adjustment, it is developing a program&#13;
to be implemented by the HRD Department between FY97-98 to develop the required&#13;
knowledge, experience and management skills necessary to reform MEA. In conjunction with the&#13;
General Affairs Department, the HRD Department would also revise and correct rules and&#13;
regulations in order to support MEA's move towards commercialization during the period FY97-&#13;
99.&#13;
Planning&#13;
2.8   MEA uses corporate strategic planning as a tool to enhance performance in the&#13;
management and administration of its corporate activities and in the carrying out of its&#13;
electrification mandate. The planning process seeks to integrate MEA's Corporate Plan, One-&#13;
Year Action Plans, and Annual Budgets. The preparation of the corporate plan and overall&#13;
coordination of the implementation of projects are the responsibility of the Policy and Corporate&#13;
Planning Department, which monitors performance and reviews project technical details,&#13;
associated financial and economic analyses, and financial forecasts of MEA. Planning for the&#13;
development of MEA's power distribution system is undertaken in the Power System and&#13;
Development Department. These two departments have the responsibility for implementing&#13;
Bank-financed projects. Financial Planning is the responsibility of the Finance Department.&#13;
2.9   MEA's principal planning document is the Corporate Plan, which includes the Power&#13;
Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Plan, covering a five year period. The Plan,&#13;
which is implemented in accordance with the NESDP and government policies, identifies MEA's&#13;
mnission and sets out its objectives and main targets. Each department identifies programs and&#13;
projects needed to deliver these main targets. Preparation of the Plan serves to formalize MEA's&#13;
planning and is intended to ensure an integrated approach covering the technical, financial and&#13;
economic aspects of developing the power distribution system. The annual budget is the&#13;
mechanism for funding the actual action plan. At present, the FY92-96 Corporate Plan has been&#13;
implemented and most of the targeted objectives have been achieved. While MEA has introduced&#13;
a strategic management process, the current situation has several shortcomings: (a) planning is&#13;
not driven by line managers, but tends to be imposed by the Planning Department; (b) the&#13;
planning linkages are weak, i.e. financial planning is not well integrated into the corporate&#13;
planning process, nor corporate planning with the budgeting process; (c) budgeting tends to be a&#13;
'top down" process and there is no mechanism at the district level to ensure that all staff&#13;
resources are included in the budget; and (d) management information is inadequate for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
current requirements. It is imperative that MEA improves its concept and process of planning.&#13;
Managers need to get involved in the line management responsibility of planning and the role of&#13;
the Corporate Planning Department should be one of facilitating the process.&#13;
Operational Management&#13;
2.10  MEA's challenge has been and will continue to be to absorb the continuing rapid growth&#13;
in its demand and the substantial increase in the size of its investment program. Over the past five&#13;
years, energy sales increased from 19,761 Gwh to 29,106 Gwh, over 11% on average. Annual&#13;
capital investments, which have been at the relatively low level of about Baht 1.1 billion in 1987&#13;
and 1988, surged in the 1990s: to Baht 3 billion in 1991 and to Baht 5.5 billion in FY95. The&#13;
number of consumers served by MEA increased from about 1 million in 1987 to 1.4 million in&#13;
1991 and to 1.8 million in 1995. Growth rates of this order imply a doubling of capacity every&#13;
eight to ten years with commensurate funding implication for MEA.  Along with strong&#13;
operational performance programs MEA needs to strengthen its organizational base to cope with&#13;
challenges posed by rapid growth in demand.&#13;
2.11  MEA conducts regular maintenance within stipulated intervals, and the standards observed&#13;
for major maintenance work are satisfactory.  MEA is well aware of the desirability to&#13;
underground as much of the 69kV and 24kV/12kV system as possible but also bears in mind that&#13;
undergrounding is 10-15 times more expensive than overhead lines, and has planned for three&#13;
underground cable projects in its five year plan. Power losses amount to about 4.5% of electricity&#13;
purchases and are favorable when compared to those for other countries worldwide. Installing&#13;
sufficient plant to cope with the growth rate while at the same time improving reliability figures&#13;
and keeping losses down to current levels would be MEA's major challenge in the coming years.&#13;
MBEA's plants are summarized in Annex 4.&#13;
2.12 This would be the second loan of the Bank to MEA, and MEA has now become fully&#13;
familiar with procurement under international competitive bidding. Processing of tenders and&#13;
award of contracts are undertaken equitably and expeditiously.&#13;
Customer Management&#13;
2.13  MEA has an effective security deposit system in place, which ensures minimum revenue&#13;
loss through bad debts, and MEA operates an effective disconnection/reconnection policy for&#13;
defaulting consumers. The overall level of accounts receivable has been maintained at one and a&#13;
half months or less of credit sales.&#13;
2.14  The customer system at MEA has several limitations; i.e. unnecessary manual intervention,&#13;
less than optimum use of computer systems, electricity bill limitations, inadequate debtors&#13;
management, and limitations of disconnection policy. These will be addressed in the short term by&#13;
the Rules and Regulations Improvement Program. Over time, MEA would need to install a&#13;
totally new customer system which would interface with other corporate systems such as&#13;
distribution facilities and work management systems to give a comprehensive customer&#13;
information base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
2.15  At present, MEA does not charge for the energy expended on public lighting. According&#13;
to the FY95 Annual Report this represented an expenditure of Baht 223 million. MEA needs to&#13;
review its policy of funding public lighting and consider whether a contribution should be made by&#13;
either the Government or the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA).&#13;
Accounting and Finance&#13;
2.16  MEA's accounting and financial systems have improved significantly as a result of a&#13;
technical assistance component under the Bank's first project (Distribution System and Energy&#13;
Efficiency Project, Loan 3598-TH), which included a component for accounting and financial&#13;
system expansion. The system is computerized and comprises some 80 individual programs&#13;
spanning 200 files. MEA produces financial accounts to acceptable international standards which&#13;
sustain an independent annual audit. It manages a huge customer base with a cash collection&#13;
performance which compares favorably with good international utility practice.  While the&#13;
accounting and finance systems and procedures in MEA satisfied its needs up to now, the scope&#13;
and structure of the systems need to significantly change and develop to accommodate the needs&#13;
of the new business culture. The important strategic tool of management accounting, used by&#13;
advanced utilities, is in use in MEA Headquarters and the districts. However, because of&#13;
organizational issues, its management accounting is underdeveloped and confined to the&#13;
budgetary process. Hence, it has a short term perspective and fails to provide the comprehensive&#13;
decision support and strategic analysis needed. The fragmentation of activities between the&#13;
Accounts and Budget Department and the lack of proper activity costing are other factors&#13;
hindering its development. These issues are being addressed by MEA.&#13;
Information Systems&#13;
2.17  In general, the development of software systems in MEA  is based on detailed&#13;
recommendations of the 1989 PA Consulting Group report, financed from the Asian Development&#13;
Bank (ADB) and associated with the first Bank project. Despite the importance placed by&#13;
management on information technology in facilitating institutional reform, MEA is not well-&#13;
positioned to exploit fully its present significant investment and to secure the benefits from that&#13;
investment. A review of current implementation indicates that progress to date has been less than&#13;
satisfactory, and in some cases, falls short of the original targets. MEA would address the total&#13;
future direction and shape of information technology with a view to developing a result-oriented&#13;
strategic plan for the structure and use of information technology in MEA&#13;
Audit&#13;
2.18  MEA has an Internal Audit Department with a staff of about 62 people; it reports directly&#13;
to the MEA Governor. The Internal Audit Department reviews the accounts of each department&#13;
and district office, focusing largely on asset management, accounting for materials and cash.&#13;
MEA operating divisions also are audited to ensure that they follow MEA guidelines. The scope&#13;
of internal audit, however, needs to be broadened so that much more locational auditing is done.&#13;
The audit function has a key role to play in system development and should sign off all new&#13;
systems before they become operational, ensure that policies and procedures not only are being&#13;
carried out but also that systems of delegated authority are functioning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
2.19  While the principle of financial auditing is established in MEA, technical auditing is non-&#13;
existent. Accompanying the greater decentralization of district activities and responsibilities, is&#13;
the need for greater accountability for their actions. Also, there is a growing requirement for a&#13;
quality ethic in every aspect of business both to meet increasing customer expectations and to&#13;
achieve high standards in business performance. Consequently, there is a growing need to&#13;
introduce a formal management auditing process of a high standard to meet the needs of&#13;
management at various levels.&#13;
2.20  Financial accounts in MEA reflect international accounting standards and are subject to&#13;
annual audit by the Auditor General. Accounts are produced roughly two months after the year&#13;
end. This reflects the fact there are two closings; the first one is done after all accruals and&#13;
provisions are posted and the second, which is the final one, done after all overhead&#13;
apportionment. Agreement was reached during negotiations that MEA would submit to the Bank&#13;
audited annual financial statements within six months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
Insurance&#13;
2.21  MEA carries adequate insurance protection against fire for buildings and their contents.&#13;
No third party liability insurance is carried. This is the general practice in most public enterprises&#13;
in Thailand and given the characteristics of the risk for MEA, it is acceptable. Insurance policies&#13;
are reviewed and updated once a year. During negotiations, agreement was reached that MEA&#13;
would continue to make provisions satisfactory to the Bank to provide insurance against such&#13;
risks and in amounts consistent with appropriate practice.&#13;
Taxes&#13;
2.22  MEA remits a portion of its net income to the Government as determined by the Ministry&#13;
of Finance (MOF) on a periodic basis. As advised by the Government's Budget Bureau, MEA&#13;
has been remitting taxes each year since September 30, 1991 at a level which rose from 15% of&#13;
net income to 24% in FY92 and to the current level of 30% since FY94. To achieve greater&#13;
independence from government regulation, MEA has applied for excellent state enterprise status&#13;
since May 1993. MEA has not yet complied with some of the criteria.&#13;
B. ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN AND PROGRAM&#13;
2.23  The Government of Thailand is implementing far ranging structural and corporate reforms&#13;
in the power sector. Its objectives in seeking to reform the power sector are aimed at lowering&#13;
the burden of incumbent state-owned power utilities on the state-budget, reducing foreign&#13;
borrowing  and  increasing  management and  investment efficiency.    A  strategy  of&#13;
commercialization and corporatization which would eventually lead to privatization of the&#13;
restructured power enterprises has been adopted to achieve these objectives.&#13;
2.24  To adequately define a strategy, MEA initiated studies in 1995, producing a preliminary&#13;
report in August 1996. Plans for organizational restructuring have been subsequently influenced&#13;
by the on-going process of regulatory reform. The National Energy Policy Office has developed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
draft regulatory standards for the supervision of the different operational functions (i.e.&#13;
transmission, generation, bulk supply, distribution and retail supply) in the power sector.&#13;
Consequently, the organizational restructuring strategy for MEA will have to conform to the&#13;
requirements of the new regulatory system and standards being developed in parallel. A phased&#13;
restructuring strategy will be adopted for MEA to ensure that near-term actions can be defined&#13;
and implemented with provision for adjusting longer-term strategies.&#13;
2.25   The organizational restructuring of MEA is proposed to be undertaken in two phases-&#13;
Phase 1 for the period 1998 to 2000 and covered under the proposed project, and Phase 2 for the&#13;
period 2001-2005. Milestones have been established in Phase 1 for MEA to measure its progress&#13;
in the implementation process. Specific milestones for Phase 2 would be established later.&#13;
Phase 1 (period 1998-2000):&#13;
2.26 During Phase 1, MEA would continue as a State-owned enterprise. It would focus on&#13;
improving the reliability and efficiency of its operations. The objective of this phase would be to&#13;
provide a clear cost efficiency focus in the core 'tlistribution" and '1upply" functions, separate&#13;
profitable activities into separate subsidiary companies and create an efficient holding company&#13;
structure. This cost separation and commercial focus of different operations within MEA would&#13;
be crucial to the later introduction of wholesale and retail competition. The introduction of&#13;
wholesale competition that would allow MEA, PEA and large consumers to contract directly with&#13;
generators is part of the Government's long-term  reform  strategy.  Introduction of retail&#13;
competition would follow subsequently.&#13;
2.27 By the end of Phase 1, MEA will be reorganized as a state-owned holding company with&#13;
2&#13;
separate subsidiaries for Design and Manufacturing, Electrical Systems and Services, and Energy&#13;
Services. These profit making non-core businesses will be later divested.&#13;
2.28 The following key medium-term reorganization actions would pave the way for achieving&#13;
the long-term strategic objectives:&#13;
(a)    Creation of Business Units: MEA would reorganize activities that are not part of&#13;
its core corporate support service functions into profit centers with a view of&#13;
complete corporate separation and divestiture of potentially profitable and&#13;
competitive businesses. Two broad groups have been identified:&#13;
- Business Units for Corporatization and Divestiture: The activities&#13;
comprising design and manufacturing and electrical systems services&#13;
would be reorganized to form two separate subsidiary companies by&#13;
A holding company is a company that owns and supervises a number of subsidiary companies. A holding&#13;
company may be either state-owned or privately owned.&#13;
2&#13;
A subsidiary company is defined as a separate legal entity that is either wholly or majority owned by MEA. If&#13;
MEA remains a state-owned enterprise, by definition the subsidiary companies will be state-owned&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
end-1999. As a first step these units will be organized as profit centers&#13;
by end-1998. It is planned that these subsidiary companies, which will&#13;
initially be owned by the MEA holding company, will be divested in&#13;
2000, or soon thereafter. The activities comprising electrical and civil&#13;
design, and electrical and civil construction would be reorganized to&#13;
form subsidiary companies under the MEA holding company and will&#13;
be divested by 2001 or shortly thereafter.&#13;
-  Business Units for Corporatization:   The  activities/functions  of&#13;
information technology; the hospital; human resources, training and&#13;
development; legal; production, repair and maintenance; internal&#13;
services; and the testing laboratory will be formed as profit centers by&#13;
end- 1998.&#13;
(b)    Unbundling of Core Distribution Activities: The core distribution activities would&#13;
be separated into '&lt;upply" and 'distribution" These activities would be created&#13;
with clear cost-accounting separation (i.e. cost centers) by end-1998 and as profit&#13;
centers by end- 1999. The separation of the '&lt;upply" business consisting of retail&#13;
commercial activities of customer billing and customer services from 'distribution"&#13;
consisting of the wires business is crucial for the subsequent introduction of&#13;
wholesale competition and open access . As part of this process MEA would&#13;
develop and implement new cost accounting and management information systems&#13;
to support this unbundled structure.&#13;
(c)    Reorganization of Support Units: MEA will create a corporate center of central&#13;
support units. There would be a main support or operating unit for corporate&#13;
planning, human resources, board and management affairs, finance and investment,&#13;
and business development. The reorganization of the support units would be&#13;
completed by end- 1998.&#13;
(d)    Creation of an Energy Efficiency Profit Center: A separate profit center would be&#13;
created within MEA to provide energy conservation services. This profit center&#13;
would operate as an Energy Service Company (ESCO) providing consumers&#13;
energy conservation services based on a performance contracting approach. Such&#13;
a profit center would be established by end-1997 as a subsidiary company under&#13;
the MEA holding company.&#13;
3&#13;
The supply business will comprise consumer metering, billing, collection and other retail customer service&#13;
functions. The distribution business will comprise the distribution network (i.e. the wires) and all system&#13;
planning, network construction and maintenance functions. When competition is introduced at the retail&#13;
level (for large and/or small consumers), the distribution business will provide open access to its network for&#13;
all generators and electricity suppliers to access retail consumers. Clear cost separation of the supply and&#13;
distribution businesses, their formation as profit centers and then separate corporate entities is therefore a&#13;
critical preparatory step to introduce retail competition. Corporate reorganization as separate entities would&#13;
also allow for privatizing them as independent businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
2.29  Figures 1 and 2 in Annex 5 represent the organizational transformation in Phase 1.&#13;
Phase 2 (period 2001 - 2005).&#13;
2.30 The precise timeframes for activities in this phase have not been defined in detail as they&#13;
are dependent on the outcomes of complementary sectoral reforms and market conditions. The&#13;
following would be the guiding principles and objectives:&#13;
(a)   During Phase 1, MEA would examine the efficiency and operational benefits of&#13;
reorganizing the supply business into multiple franchise areas. Depending on the&#13;
outcome of the assessment, MEA would during Phase 2, transform the supply&#13;
company into profit center franchise operations.  Options for private sector&#13;
involvement in these distribution franchises would be evaluated and preferred&#13;
options implemented.  It is envisaged that during this phase, private sector&#13;
operators would be brought into the supply business. The privatization of the&#13;
supply franchises and the distribution company would be pursued in this phase.&#13;
(b)   Based on the phased introduction of open access transmission operations that&#13;
would allow generators to contract directly with PEA and MEA, the distribution&#13;
company would also allow open access to its network.  It is expected that&#13;
wholesale competition for bulk supply to distributors and also to a limited number&#13;
of retail consumers would be achieved in Thailand during this period.&#13;
2.31   The restructuring of MEA needs to be carefully phased and sequenced with the intention&#13;
of building important commercial capabilities in order to achieve a successful transition to the&#13;
private sector. Human resource and skills upgrading is seen as crucial to any successful move&#13;
towards privatization. Agreement was reached at negotiations that MEA would restructure and&#13;
improve its organization according to the Reorganization Plan; any revision of the said Plan shall&#13;
be subject to review and acceptance by the Bank. Agreement was also reached with MEA that it&#13;
would furnish documentary evidence satisfactory to the Bank in support of the separation of the&#13;
'upply" and "distribution" profit centers, including separate statements of accounts and&#13;
compliance with performance standards set by NEPO. In addition, it would avail itself of&#13;
technical assistance for restructuring and improving its organization according to terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank. Annex 5 provides details of the organizational restructuring&#13;
program. A summary of salient activities to be undertaken by MEA is provided below:&#13;
Human Resource Management:&#13;
*  closely link personnel policies and procedures to the achievement of corporate&#13;
objectives and strategic plans;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES, PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.1   Objectives. The main objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) improve the reliability&#13;
of the distribution system and contain losses at current levels, while meeting the projected rapid&#13;
increase in electricity demand; (b) assist in the organizational restructuring of MEA leading to its&#13;
commercialization and corporatization; and (c) introduce demand-side management capabilities in&#13;
MEA's organization thus deepening the DSM focus in the country's most rapidly growing area.&#13;
3.2   Performance Monitoring.  The achievement of project objectives is proposed to be&#13;
monitored during and after project implementation through the following project performance&#13;
indicators (see Annex 6 for details): (a) improvements in system reliability and containment of&#13;
system losses: (i) reduction in System Average Interruption Frequency Index; (ii) reduction in&#13;
Customer Average Interruption Duration Index; and (iii) maintenance of losses at current levels;&#13;
(b) organizational restructuring (apart from monitoring of compliance with financial covenants):&#13;
(i) separation and divestiture of non-core activities; (ii) unbundling of core distributing activities&#13;
into "supply" and "distribution" activities; (iii) increase in Gwh sales per employee; (iv) increase in&#13;
customers per employee; (v) achievement of "Good State Enterprise" status; and (vi) time taken&#13;
for procurement decisions; and (c) introduction of DSM capabilities: (i) setting up of Appliance&#13;
Testing Laboratory and numbers of appliances tested; (ii) establishment of Energy Service&#13;
Company (ESCO) and number of energy management projects performed; and (iii) number of&#13;
premises covered by Load Research. In addition to the above performance indicators, target&#13;
dates would be defined to monitor progress in the implementation of the project components.&#13;
3.3   Description. Investment Component - This component would finance a portion of the&#13;
expansion and reinforcement of MEA's distribution system over the years 1997-2001 (the Eighth&#13;
Plan period) and would comprise of three main investment components: (a) transmission and&#13;
distribution substation system-comprising: (i) a new 230/115 kV Onnuj transmission substation;&#13;
(ii) additions at four existing 230/115 kV transmission substations (Thanontok, Nongjok,&#13;
Jangwatana, Sainoi); (iii) construction of six new 69-115/12-24 kV distribution substations&#13;
(Taweewattana, Jangron, Bangkae, Klongmai, Sainoi, Watbamphen); (iv) additions at five&#13;
existing 69-115/12-24 kV distribution substations (Bangmod, Wangpetchaboon, Sri-Eiam,&#13;
Huaykwang, Sainamtip); and (v) additions at and modification of four existing 69-115/12-24 kV&#13;
distribution substations (Mochit, Prakanong, Paknam, Watlieb); (b) transmission line systems-&#13;
comprising 47.3 circuit-km of transmission lines in Bangkoknoi and Chidlom areas; and (c)&#13;
distribution system-comprising: (i) addition and modification of 1,280 circuit km of primary and&#13;
2,100 circuit km of secondary lines; (ii) installation of 1,350 MVA of distribution transformers;&#13;
(iii) addition and replacement of 280,000 revenue meters; and (d) addition of 205 MVAR of&#13;
capacitors.&#13;
3.4   Policy Component - This component provides for a major restructuring of MEA's&#13;
organization leading to commercialization and corporatization of the entity (para. 2.28). An&#13;
Organizational Restructuring Plan approved by MEA Board and NEPO provides for: (a)&#13;
unbundling of MEA's "supply" and "distribution" functions; (b) establishment of a corporate&#13;
center for central support functions; (c) creation of business units for non-core functions; and (d)&#13;
establishment of subsidiary companies for Electrical Systems Services, Product Design and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Manufacturing, and Energy Services. In regard to "supply" and "distribution" functions, these&#13;
would be established by 1999 as full-fledged profit centers, which would maintain separate&#13;
statements of accounts and which would be governed by the performance criteria that would be&#13;
set by the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO), the regulator of the sector. The cost separation&#13;
and commercial focus of different operations within MEA would be crucial to the later&#13;
introduction of wholesale and retail competition. Institutional Development Component - This&#13;
component provides for the introduction of DSM capabilities in MEA's organization, comprising:&#13;
(a) setting up of an Appliance Testing Laboratory; (b) introduction of a system-wide Load&#13;
Research program to collect load-profile data of MEA consumers; (c) implementation of a load&#13;
control program to reduce commercial demand during critical system conditions; (d)&#13;
establishment of an Energy Service Company (ESCO) to provide energy management services in&#13;
Bangkok; and (e) technical assistance for the four DSM components (see Annex 7 for details).&#13;
Agreement was reached at negotiations that MEA would implement the investment and DSM&#13;
components according to action plans acceptable to the Bank and avail itself of technical&#13;
assistance for the DSM component under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.5   MEA will be fully responsible for implementation of all project components. NEPO will&#13;
oversee the implementation of the organizational restructuring of MEA. The project will be&#13;
executed with close cooperation between MEA's various departments and offices, as given below&#13;
(see Annex 8 for Implementation Schedule). MEA does not need consulting assistance for&#13;
expanding its distribution system.  Technical assistance will be availed of for MEA's&#13;
organizational restructuring and for implementation of the DSM components.&#13;
3.6   The Power System Planning and Development Department will be responsible for overall&#13;
coordination, day-to-day implementation of the project and preparation of tender documents. The&#13;
Electrical Designs and Civil Engineering Works Department will be responsible for the design for&#13;
transmission and distribution substations, transmission lines (115 kV and 69 kV) and major&#13;
primary distribution lines (24 kV and 12 kV), review of contract drawings, land acquisition and&#13;
request for right-of-way.  The Purchases and Stores Department will be responsible for&#13;
procurement (including bid evaluation and contract awards) as well as storage of equipment. The&#13;
Finance Department will be responsible for financial planning and analysis.  The Civil&#13;
Construction Department will be responsible for construction of buildings and civil works. The&#13;
Electrical Construction Department will be responsible for installation and testing of transmission&#13;
and distribution substations, sub-transmission line (115 kV and 69 kV), major primary distribution&#13;
lines (24 kV and 12 kV) and capacitors. The District Offices will be responsible for the balance of&#13;
works associated with distribution lines, distribution transformers and revenue meters. MEA's&#13;
DSM Committee will be responsible for implementing the DSM component. MEA's Working&#13;
Committee for Implementing the Restructuring Plan will be responsible for implementing the&#13;
organizational restructuring.&#13;
3.7   All transmission lines under the project will be pole-mounted, and will be routed along&#13;
roads where MEA has right-of-way, thus avoiding potential right-of-way problems. Land for all&#13;
substations is already available. The project implementation schedule will, therefore, not be&#13;
affected by land acquisition problems. MEA has prepared a Project Implementation Plan in line&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
with Bank guidelines (Annex 18, Ref. 1). The bar chart showing the implementing arrangements&#13;
for the various project components is given in Chart 2. The project would be implemented over&#13;
the 1997-2002 period. The above implementation arrangements are appropriate for timely&#13;
execution of the project and are satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
3.8   Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in terms of physical&#13;
execution and financial reports were agreed with MEA, at negotiations. It was also agreed that&#13;
MEA will furnish quarterly progress reports. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will&#13;
be drafted by the Bank not later than six months after closing of the loans and agreement would&#13;
be reached at negotiations that MEA would assist in its preparation. MEA will adopt a plan for&#13;
the operational phase of the project. MEA will also prepare and make available to the Bank its&#13;
own evaluation report, including a summary report which will be attached unedited to the ICR.&#13;
The evaluation would assess the project execution and initial operation, its costs and benefits, the&#13;
Bank's performance, its own performance of the obligations under the Loan Agreements, and the&#13;
extent to which the purposes of the Loan were achieved.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
3.9   Supervision of this project will extend essentially over a period of six years, 1997-2002.&#13;
The key issues that would be focused upon are: (a) periodic reviews of MEA's investment plan in&#13;
keeping with changes in the economic scenario; (b) compliance with financial covenants to assure&#13;
the financial health of MEA while undertaking a large investment program; (c) progress in the&#13;
restructuring of MEA's organization; and (d) technical supervision of physical implementation of&#13;
the project components. Bank missions accompanied: (a) with the Energy Sector Management&#13;
Assistance Program (ESMAP) staff as necessary, would assist MEA and the Government in&#13;
organizational restructuring of MEA; and (b) with the Asia Alternative Energy Unit (ASTAE)&#13;
staff as necessary, would assist MEA in implementing the DSM components of the project.&#13;
Supervision of the project would require expertise in power engineering, economics, financial&#13;
analysis, corporate restructuring and DSM. Three missions annually for a period of six years from&#13;
1997 to 2002 (normally coinciding with supervision missions for ongoing Bank-assisted projects)&#13;
are foreseen for adequate supervision of this project. The total estimated staff inputs are: (a)&#13;
power engineer, economist and financial analyst-36 staff-weeks; (b) corporate restructuring&#13;
specialist-9 staff-weeks; (c) DSM specialist-10 staff-weeks; and (d) legal expert-6 staff-&#13;
weeks (see Annex 9 for details).&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENT&#13;
3.10  A detailed Environmental Impact Analysis (including route surveys) of the substations,&#13;
transmission lines and the distribution network to be constructed under the project has been&#13;
conducted by MEA (Annex 18, Ref. 2). This has concluded that none of these components&#13;
(which are all located in the developed metropolitan areas of Bangkok) will encroach on&#13;
ecologically sensitive forest areas, or affect any agricultural land. Disposal of poly chlorinated&#13;
butyl (PCB) will follow MEA's established practice of shipping it to foreign countries (especially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
France) for treatment and disposal. The project, as a whole, would, therefore, have no adverse&#13;
impact on the environment and has thus been classified under Category B.&#13;
3.11   The one new  transmission substation and the six new  distribution substations to be&#13;
constructed under the project are located in the premises of EGAT substations or the&#13;
industrial/commercial complexes that would be supplied from these substations. This land is&#13;
available to MEA on long-term lease and has involved no displacement of persons. Additions and&#13;
modifications of existing transmission and distribution substations involve no land procurement.&#13;
All transmission lines under the project will be constructed on existing right-of-ways and MEA's&#13;
surveys have shown that there are no persons currently residing in these routes. Almost 95% of&#13;
the distribution line additions and modifications will be done on existing poles and would involve&#13;
no displacement of persons. The remaining 5% of the line construction would be undertaken on&#13;
new roads to be constructed by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA). The BMA&#13;
would provide MEA a clear route for the location of poles. Hence the project would not involve&#13;
displacement of any persons. The practice of BMA is to procure land at market rates through&#13;
negotiations with persons affected by the new road construction and required to relocate.&#13;
Agreement was reached at negotiations that procurement of land, if any, for the construction of&#13;
substations or transmission or distribution lines will not involve expropriation, involuntary&#13;
resettlement or rehabilitation or compensation.&#13;
D. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.12   The total financing required by MEA  for the proposed project (including capitalized&#13;
interest during construction) is estimated at US$373 million, with a foreign exchange component&#13;
of US$157 million. Details of the cost estimate are presented in Annex 10. Costs are at&#13;
December 1995 price levels and are based on actual price quotations for similar equipment&#13;
purchased by MEA. Physical contingencies have been assumed at 5% of the base cost. Price&#13;
contingencies are estimated on the basis of escalation factors of-4.9% for 1997; 4.0% for 1998;&#13;
3.3% for 1999-for the local cost components and 2.3% for the foreign cost components,&#13;
following Bank guidelines. Table 3.1 summarizes the cost estimates for the proposed project.&#13;

E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.13  Table 3.2 summarizes the expected financing sources for the project. Bank financing&#13;
would account for about 39% of the project cost (including interest during construction) and&#13;
about 92 % of its foreign exchange component. The Bank loan would be US$145 million in&#13;
single currency, US$ denominated, fixed interest loan, with a 3-6 year disbursement period and a&#13;
12-15 years maturity. MEA would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks for its loan,&#13;
which would be guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand. Other borrowings would include local&#13;
commercial bank loans and bonds for 5-7 year duration, with interest rates of about 10% (para.&#13;
4.22)&#13;

F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.14 All contracts financed by the Bank would be awarded on the basis of International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines, published in&#13;
January 1995 and revised in January 1996 and August 1996.&#13;
3.15  The invitation to bid for each contract estimated to cost US$10 million equivalent or more&#13;
shall be advertised in accordance with the procedures applicable to large contracts under&#13;
paragraph 2.8 of the Bank's procurement guidelines. The bid documents would follow the text of&#13;
the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. Bid evaluation would be done in the Bank's Standard&#13;
Bid Evaluation Form. In the evaluation of bids for goods procured following ICB procedures, a&#13;
domestic price preference margin equal to 15% of the CIF bid price of imported goods or the&#13;
actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be allowed for domestic&#13;
manufactures. Prior Bank review of bid documents and approval of contract awards would be&#13;
mandatory for all contracts expected to cost the equivalent of US$2.5 million or more. This&#13;
would cover about 85% of total contract value. Selective post review of about 25% of the&#13;
awarded contracts below the threshold value would be carried out during supervision missions.&#13;
3.16  A Procurement Plan for the project is given at Annex 11. Two transmission substations&#13;
and five distribution substations would be implemented through single responsibility supply and&#13;
install contracts. Equipment and materials for the remaining substations, transmission lines and&#13;
distribution system would be procured through 36 packages. Conductors for transmission lines&#13;
would be fabricated locally out of aluminum and copper ingots. The ingots would be procured&#13;
through ICB procedures and financed from the Bank loan. Local fabrication of conductors will&#13;
not be financed from the Bank loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
G. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.17 The Bank loan would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures for&#13;
imported equipment and materials; (b) 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally&#13;
manufactured items procured through ICB; and (c) 70% of local expenditures for materials and&#13;
equipment procured locally. For all equipment and material contracts, disbursements would be&#13;
made against frill documentation. However, MEA will ensure that each withdrawal application&#13;
would not be less than US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
3.18 Retroactive financing would be permnitted to the extent of 10% of the loan amount i.e.&#13;
US$14.5 million equivalent for payments made prior to the date of loan agreement but after&#13;
February 28, 1997, the appraisal date. This is required as MEA has already started procurement&#13;
action in view of the urgency for implementing some of the project components.&#13;
3.19   Annex 12 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan and the standard&#13;
profile of disbursements for power projects in Asia.  Considering the advanced stage of&#13;
preparation by MEA, the proposed loan is expected to be disbursed slightly faster than indicated&#13;
by the standard profile. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2002 and the closing&#13;
date for the loan would be December 31, 2002.&#13;

p (3-year average)&#13;
\a Excluding VAT&#13;
4.2    During the period FY91-95, MEA's energy sales grew at an annual average of about 11%,&#13;
from 19,761 Gwh in FY91 to 29,106 Gwh in FY95. This high growth rate mirrored the&#13;
performance of the Thai economy.&#13;
4.3    The strong sales performance caused MEA's financial indicators to remain robust and&#13;
performance ratios at healthy levels. Except for FY93, the rates of return (ROR) on net revalued&#13;
assets in operation were at the 10-15% range and the self-financing ratios (SFR) were at the 50-&#13;
100% range. Two noteworthy developments had an impact on MEA's financial operations. First,&#13;
in FY92, the introduction of the value added tax (VAT) system caused a slight erosion in MEA's&#13;
profitability. Although MEA's energy revenues increased from Baht 35.6 billion in 1991 to Baht&#13;
38.3 billion in 1992 (an 8% increase), application of the VAT in January 1992, resulted in a drop&#13;
in the average energy price from Baht 1.80 in 1991 to Baht 1.75 in 1992 as MEA had to carry the&#13;
burden of additional taxes not covered by the automatic tariff adjustment. The effect was a&#13;
reduction in net income by about Baht 375 million or by 19% in 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
4.4   Second, despite continued satisfactory operating results in FY93, MEA fell short of its&#13;
obligation to contribute at least 25% of internally generated funds to investment and recorded its&#13;
lowest SFR in its financial history. Operating revenues in FY93 increased by 11% from Baht 38.6&#13;
billion in FY92 to Baht 42.2 billion, on the strength of continued increases in electric energy sales&#13;
and consumer contributions for construction. Due to the combined effect of improved revenues&#13;
and stable operating ratio (97%), net profit increased by 9% from Baht 1.6 billion in FY92 to&#13;
Baht 1.8 billion in FY93. However, MEA's funds generated from internal sources amounted to&#13;
only 21% of its three-year average capital expenditures. This was caused primarily by an increase&#13;
in working capital requirements due to high inventory levels for materials and supplies from Baht&#13;
2.8 billion in FY92 to Baht 3.5 billion in FY93. Other factors which contributed to MEA's non-&#13;
compliance with the SFR covenant included the increased remittance to the Government from the&#13;
previous 15% level to 24% in FY93, the remittance toward automatic tariff adjustment of&#13;
marginal revenue amounting to Baht 0.8 billion, MEA's quicker processing of payment to&#13;
contractors, and a sizable increase in the three year average investment (from an average of Baht&#13;
3.1 billion in FY92 to Baht 4.3 billion in FY93). MIEA, subsequently, resolved its tumover&#13;
problems with inventory control and was able to report a satisfactory SFR of 79% the following&#13;
year.&#13;
B. PRESENT FINANCIAL POSITION&#13;
4.5   In FY95, MEA continued to record satisfactory financial performance. Electric energy&#13;
sales increased by 12% over FY94 from 26,255 Gwh to 29,106 Gwh. The increase in operating&#13;
revenues was attributed to the increase in electricity demand and increase in the average tariff&#13;
from Baht 1.77/kWh in FY94 to Baht 1.88/kWh in FY95. Consequently, operating and net&#13;
incomes surged in FY95 by 28% and 37%, respectively, despite increases in the cost of purchased&#13;
power (16%), government remittances (37%), depreciation (25%) and debt-related expenses&#13;
(1 1%).&#13;
4.6  In accordance with regulations applicable to state enterprises, MEA is liable to remit a&#13;
proportion of its net income to the MOF at a level determined at year's end. The remittance level&#13;
of 15% of net income throughout the period FY87-92, was increased to 24% in FY93, was again&#13;
raised to 30% in FY94, and has been maintained at that level as MEA seeks to conform to the&#13;
Govemment's requirements for excellent state enterprise status.&#13;
4.7   MEA's capital structure remained satisfactory, with the debt to total capitalization ratio&#13;
remaining at or below a comfortable level of 30% during the FY91-95 period. Debt service&#13;
coverage was at or above 3.1 times throughout the period and was above the minimum ratio&#13;
required by the Bank loan of 1.5 times. MEA's local and foreign liabilities consist of local bonds&#13;
issued in 1991 and 1994 and foreign obligations comprised of loans from the Bank and the ADB,&#13;
and foreign bonds. The first MEA local bond in 1991 of Baht 1.3 billion was due for redemption&#13;
in July 1996. The balance of the bond was transferred to the current portion of long-term loans in&#13;
FY95 which accounts for the substantial increase in current debt obligations from Baht 333&#13;
million in FY94 to Baht 1,795 million in FY95. The second local bond in 1994 of Baht 800&#13;
million with a term of seven years is due in November 2000. The foreign bond, which was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
arranged by MOF through Yankee bonds, amounts to Baht 1.5 billion (US$60 million) and has a&#13;
term of 10 years.&#13;
4.8    MEA's foreign exchange gains and losses on loan repayments arise as a result of&#13;
differences in exchange rates between year end and at the date of loan repayments. MEA revalues&#13;
foreign currency loans as of September 30 of each year, and spreads the loss over the remaining&#13;
terms of the loans to a deferred foreign exchange adjustment account. The losses on foreign&#13;
exchange which were charged to its FY95 operations increased from Baht 806 million in FY94 to&#13;
Baht 869 million largely due to an increase in deferred losses from loan adjustments of its&#13;
multicurrency pooled obligations with the Bank and the ADB. Even with the increase in MEA's&#13;
long term debt as a result of the inclusion of the deferred foreign exchange account, its debt to&#13;
equity ratio remained well below the covenanted ratio set in previous Bank agreements at 60:40.&#13;
4.9   MEA's financial position as of FY95 is healthy, with budgeted amounts showing an SFR&#13;
of 54%, an ROR of 11.4%, and a debt service coverage ratio of 3.8 times. The debt to total&#13;
capitalization ratio, the debt to equity ratio and the current ratio have all been favorably stable at&#13;
0.3 times, 0.4 times and 1.8 times, respectively. The numbers reflect a continuation of MWA's&#13;
financial strength experienced from the late 1980s through the first half of the 1990s and are&#13;
caused in a large part by the substantial sales increases which were sustained over the years.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL OUTLOOK&#13;
4.10  MEA's healthy financial performance is projected to continue throughout the 1990s and&#13;
well into the 2000s. Projections of MEA's financial performance for the period FY96-2002 and&#13;
the assumptions underlying these projections are presented in Annex 14. Key financial indicators&#13;
are presented in Table 4.2.&#13;
4.11   MEA's energy sales are forecast to increase on average by 7.6% from 31,664 Gwh at the&#13;
end of FY96 to 48,684 Gwh at the end of FY2002. The decline in average growth rates from the&#13;
previous high levels of 11%, is closely related to the predicted slackening growth in the gross&#13;
regional product for the Greater Bangkok area, as forecast by National Economic and Social&#13;
Development Board (NESDB). The decline also takes into account the changes in population&#13;
density of MEA's distribution area, saturation levels for appliances, efficiency improvements,&#13;
successful efforts of the Government's demand-side management program, and electricity&#13;
intensity per unit of value added by the industrial sector.&#13;
As of FY96, treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses arising out of the revaluation of foreign currency&#13;
loans has been changed in accordance with Ministry of Finance guidelines. The guidelines require that&#13;
foreign exchange adjustment are to be charged as revenue or expense in the accounting period in which they&#13;
occur.&#13;

4.12   Operating revenues in FY96 are expected to increase only slightly from FY95, from Baht&#13;
55.8 billion to Baht 56.3 billion. The increase in operating revenues of about Baht 0.5 billion&#13;
would not be enough to cushion the increase in operating expenses which is expected to grow by&#13;
Baht 1.2 billion and as a result operating income would drop from Baht 2.7 billion in FY95 to&#13;
Baht 2.2 billion in FY96. The rate of return is expected to decline from the FY95 level of 11% to&#13;
6% largely because of a reduced net operating income, increased interest and commitment&#13;
charges, and the substantial expansion of the average rate base from Baht 17.7 billion in FY95 to&#13;
Baht 23.5 billion in FY96.&#13;
4.13   The challenge for MEA continues to be the ability to finance the expansion in its capital&#13;
investment, which is expected to increase by 96% between FY95 and FY96 and to expand on&#13;
average by 20% for the projected figure FY96-2001 (the Eighth Plan). At present, the trend of&#13;
MEA's actual load growth is in excess of forecasted levels in October 1995 and hence, some&#13;
projects needed to be brought forward and some additional reinforcements had to be undertaken&#13;
to meet the present load growth. In addition, MEA is still required to meet NEPO's supply&#13;
reliability and security service standards. These higher investments are necessary to rehabilitate&#13;
and upgrade the existing MEA system, as well as to build into it additional reliability. They also&#13;
reflect the escalating prices of land in Bangkok and are indicative of MEA's activities to improve&#13;
environmental acceptability, such as undergrounding of overhead systems at very high costs.&#13;
MEA's current financial strength and reasonable tariff adjustments mandated by the adjustments&#13;
in the new Bulk Supply Tariff (BST) should allow it to absorb and finance this growth.&#13;
4.14 At negotiations, agreement was reached that MEA would generate funds from internal&#13;
sources equivalent to not less than 25% of the annual average of its capital expenditure incurred,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
or expected to be incurred, for that fiscal year, the previous fiscal year, and the next following&#13;
fiscal year. The Government agreed to undertake a periodic review and adjust MEA's tariffs as&#13;
necessary to ensure that MEA earns the 25% SFR. According to current projections which take&#13;
into account the new calculation for BST and the uniform tariff compensation payment (UTCP),&#13;
MEA's tariff would need to be adjusted each year in order to comply with the financial criteria set&#13;
out in the BST formula as follows:&#13;
Table 4.3: MEA's Projected Tariff Increases&#13;

4.15  The 25% SFR covenant reflects the benchmark which the Government itself uses when&#13;
setting tariffs for the power sector. In outstanding loans, the Bank has specified that covenant&#13;
with EGAT and PEA, and ADB has agreed to the same covenant with EGAT and MEA. The&#13;
level of the new BST calculation (para. 4.18) would also be defined by the requirements for&#13;
EGAT to meet its financial performance criteria (as expressed in Bank financial covenants) and&#13;
the level of retail tariffs will be defined by the additional requirements for MEA and PEA to meet&#13;
their financial performance criteria, given the required level of the BST. Together with a debt&#13;
service ratio requirement of 1.5 times and a debt/equity ratio ceiling of 1.5:1, which are also&#13;
financial requirements of the new BST calculation, the SFR covenant will ensure financial&#13;
soundness for MBA. MEA will have an adequate capital structure; it will have adequate liquidity&#13;
and it will do so with adequate tariffs increases.&#13;
4.16  MEA's projected financial ratios are expected to be satisfactory.  The key liquidity&#13;
indicators (debt to total capital, self financing, debt service coverage and current ratios) are&#13;
projected to be satisfactory during the near term. The debt service coverage ratio would range&#13;
between 1.5 to 2.8 times throughout the projected period.  Agreement was reached at&#13;
negotiations that MEA would maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times. The&#13;
capital structure would also be more than adequate with long term debt at its peak not exceeding&#13;
1.0 times equity or a comfortable ratio of 50/50. MEA's current debt control test provides for&#13;
Bank review of borrowing when the debt to equity ratio exceeds 1.5 times or 60/40 level. To&#13;
ensure that measures are taken to maintain MEA's strong capital structure, during negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached with MEA and the Government that further debt would not be incurred if&#13;
such additional debt would raise its total long term indebtedness to more than 1.5 times its total&#13;
capitalization.&#13;
D. TARIFF LEVELS AND STRUCTURE&#13;
Existing Tariff Structure&#13;
4.17 Presently MWA and PEA receive power from EGAT at wholesale rates at several of their&#13;
grid substations. The existing bulk supply tariff is on the basis of long-run marginal cost pricing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
but takes into account equity, social and development considerations as well as the financial needs&#13;
of the three utilities, EGAT, PEA and MEA. The tariff to MEA and PEA as currently applied,&#13;
comprises a flat energy charge. The current tariff for bulk supply for MEA is Baht 1.47/kwh,&#13;
whereas the tariff for PEA is Baht 1.03/kwh, although the actual cost of supply to PEA is greater&#13;
than the cost of supply to MEA. The difference in the tariff to the two utilities is intentional, so&#13;
that the urban consumers subsidize the rural consumers, the retail tariff for all consumers in&#13;
Thailand being uniform.&#13;
4.18  The current tariff structure, which is given in Annex 15, was revised as of December 31,&#13;
1991; before that it had remained essentially without change during the previous five years but for&#13;
a small reduction in 1987. With effect from December 1992, the Government put in place an&#13;
automatic adjustment clause, by means of which the retail tariff is adjusted monthly as EGAT's&#13;
costs change for fuel, taxes, foreign exchange and demand side management. The electricity&#13;
tariffs are set by a tariff setting committee composed of EGAT, PEA, MEA, MOF, NEPO and&#13;
NIDA. The committee meets monthly to determine the automatic adjustment factor, reviews the&#13;
relative rates periodically to ensure that they accomplish the required cross-funding among the&#13;
utilities, and prepares recommendations to the NEPC on the proposed tariff increases during the&#13;
tariff setting period every three years. As in previous loans, it was agreed during negotiations that&#13;
MEA would review by April 30 of every year the adequacy of its tariffs to produce the required&#13;
self-financing, debt service coverage and debt/equity ratio obligations.&#13;
4.19  The adequacy and appropriateness of the tariff structure in Thailand was reviewed under&#13;
the Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project (Loan 3884-TH) in a study: "Rationalization of Bulk&#13;
Supply Tariff to MEA and PEA" undertaken by the three electric utilities: EGAT, PEA and&#13;
MEA in close coordination with and under the guidance of the NEPO. The study: (a) reviewed&#13;
the current and future (under a restructured power sector) financial requirements of the three&#13;
utilities and proposed a rational basis for setting tariffs consistent with their financial objectives;&#13;
(b) reviewed the existing bulk supply tariff and recommended suitable tariffs for bulk supply to&#13;
PEA and MEA that would reflect actual supply costs and future structure of the power sector; (c)&#13;
reviewed the need for a uniform national tariff and suggested a retail tariff structure based on&#13;
economic principles and equity considerations, including the necessary transparent subsidy&#13;
mechanism; (d) recommended a suitable time frame and transition strategy for implementation; (e)&#13;
suggested cost-effective metering arrangements for measuring and integrating demand and energy&#13;
for bulk supply to PEA and MEA; and (f) drafted a power purchase agreement for bulk supplies.&#13;
The study was completed in July 1996 and the recommendations have been approved by the&#13;
Cabinet. Details of the new BST and UTCP are in Annex 16.&#13;

4.21   MEA's total investment program (including expenditures for existing projects) during this&#13;
period would amount to Baht 69.8 billion (US$2.8 billion). The investment cost of the Eighth&#13;
Power Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Plan (1997-2001) is Baht 56.1 billion&#13;
(US$2.2 billion) including interest during construction. The Bank loan of US$145 million is&#13;
expected to meet about 39% of the investment cost of the proposed project, which is estimated at&#13;
about Baht 8.6 billion (US$373 million), but only about 5%  of MEA's total financing&#13;
requirements for the period. During the FY97-01 period, MEA expects to meet 23% of its capital&#13;
requirements from internally generated funds (net of debt servicing) and 10% from consumer&#13;
contributions and customer deposits. In addition to the Bank loans, it will need to borrow funds&#13;
totaling 67% of its total cash requirements. It should have no problem borrowing these funds&#13;
from the sources which traditionally have supplied it (para 4.7) as it already has commitments for&#13;
a large portion of its borrowing needs over the period. Its debt/equity ratio and debt service&#13;
coverage ratio suggest that it should have no difficulty absorbing and servicing its anticipated debt&#13;
(para. 4.16).&#13;
4.22  MEA has in the past relied on financing from the ADB to fund the foreign costs of its&#13;
projects. In 1993, it borrowed its first loan from the Bank under the Distribution System and&#13;
Energy Efficiency Project (Loan 3598-TH) for US$109 million to finance capital expenditures&#13;
under the Seventh Plan. It is expected to receive financing from OECF to finance the foreign cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
of projects and it also proposes additional borrowing from the Bank. The OECF loan is for a&#13;
term of 25 years including seven years of grace. The proposed Bank loan will have a repayment&#13;
term of 12-15 years, including three years of grace. For the local cost of projects, MEA intends&#13;
to have local bond floatations and local loans with 5-10 year maturities, amounting to about Baht&#13;
3.7 billion (US$148 million). The bonds and the loans will continue to be guaranteed by the MOF&#13;
and will carry an interest rate of between 9.5%-10.75%. MEA expects to issue additional bonds&#13;
as necessary throughout the project period, and also to borrow from local commercial banks for&#13;
any financing gap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. JUSTIFICATION&#13;
5.1   Benefits. The continuing increase in electricity demand in the metropolitan Bangkok area&#13;
has made it imperative for MEA to install new substations, construct new feeder outlets and&#13;
undertake system improvements to deliver power to consumers while maintaining an acceptable&#13;
quality of power supply (i.e. adequate levels of circuit loading, operational reliability and losses).&#13;
The project forms an important part of MEA' s least-cost expansion program. Its implementation&#13;
would help ensure the country's continued economic growth by facilitating the development of its&#13;
principal administrative, commercial and industrial center of Bangkok. Investments by MEA in&#13;
improving its system reliability, which has been of concern to the Government in recent times,&#13;
would translate into substantial economic benefits, especially to industrial and commercial&#13;
consumers. The institutional restructuring of MEA would contribute to the efficiency of its&#13;
operations and facilitate its commercialization and corporatization. The building up of DSM&#13;
capabilities within MEA would enable it to actively engage in Thailand's DSM program (hitherto&#13;
exclusively handled by EGAT), and lead to enhanced energy savings.&#13;
5.2   Least-Cost Planning. MEA has developed a master plan for supplying Bangkok, which&#13;
establishes the technical characteristics of supply from EGAT and distribution within the city.&#13;
Within the framework of this plan, MEA performs detailed least-cost analysis to ensure a cost&#13;
effective expansion of its distribution system to meet the demand growth. It uses: (a) the&#13;
"Simulation-Based Load Forecasting" computer program for small area load forecast; (b) the&#13;
"SUBSITF' computer program for determining the optimum size, location and timing of&#13;
substations; and (c) the "Constrained Multi Feeder" computer program for optimizing the sub-&#13;
transmission system.   These programs take into  consideration  alternative distribution&#13;
developments and assist in establishing the least-cost expansion.&#13;
5.3   ERR Evaluation Methodology. The proposed project consists of a number of dispersed&#13;
components which form an integral part of MEA's total investment program, covering its entire&#13;
franchise area. Most major transmission and distribution investments in the MEA area are&#13;
interrelated, and yield joint benefits of loss control, reliability improvement and incremental supply&#13;
to consumers. For this reason, the MEA investment program for 1997-2001 was evaluated as a&#13;
whole, rather than attempting to isolate individual components artificially.  The following&#13;
assumptions support the economic analysis:&#13;
(a)   the analysis is done in end- 1995 price levels;&#13;
(b)   the cost streams comprise: (i) capital investments in the system during 1997-2001,&#13;
exclusive of duties and taxes, interest during construction and capital contributions&#13;
from the consumers; and (ii) operation, maintenance and administrative costs of&#13;
the system expansion. No allowance is made for shadow exchange rate because&#13;
this value is set by the market. Also, it is considered that wages reflect the&#13;
opportunity cost of labor; therefore, no shadow values are applied;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
(c)   the cost of incremental energy purchased from EGAT is evaluated in terms of&#13;
long-run marginal cost of supply of Baht 1.45/kWh (as established by consultant's&#13;
studies updated by NEPO);&#13;
(d)   the incremental operation, maintenance and administrative costs are evaluated at&#13;
2.5% of the incremental capital costs, based on MEA's experience;&#13;
(e)   for evaluating the economic benefit arising from the incremental sales of electricity,&#13;
the appropriate parameter is the consumer's willingness-to-pay (WTP). The WTP&#13;
in metropolitan Bangkok area is substantially higher than the electricity tariff&#13;
However, for the purpose of this analysis, the average tariff of Baht 2.02/kWh (the&#13;
lower bound of WTP) realized in 1995 is used as a proxy for evaluating benefits&#13;
from incremental sales. This WTP value is assumed to remain constant in real&#13;
terms throughout the project life of 25 years;&#13;
(f)   as all incremental sales in the initial years cannot be attributed to the incremental&#13;
investments, the incremental electricity sales over the investment period are&#13;
conservatively assumed as: (i) 60% of the forecast incremental sales in 1997; (ii)&#13;
80% of the forecast incremental sales in 1998; and (iii) 100% of the forecast&#13;
incremental sales from 1999 to 2001, remaining constant thereafter;&#13;
(g)   the losses are assumed to be maintained at the current level of 4.7% which is&#13;
considered to be near optimum for MEA's system; and&#13;
(h)   the system reliability is assumed to increase progressively to yield an "unsupplied&#13;
energy" saving (as evaluated in detail by MEA) rising from 0.8 Gwh in 1997 to 8.0&#13;
Gwh in 2002. The benefit due to savings in "unsupplied energy" is valued at Baht&#13;
59/kWh based on a recent study done by consultants.&#13;
5.4   On the basis of the above assumptions, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of MEA's&#13;
investment program is computed at 20.4%  (Annex 17).  This value is considered to be&#13;
conservative in the absence of quantification of consumer surplus and the environmental/safety&#13;
benefits of MEA's program, which includes costly conversion to underground systems in several&#13;
areas of Bangkok. The ERR is tested for variations of two types of parameters: (i) those directly&#13;
related to specific project risks, such as increase in capital costs, and reduction in sales (caused by&#13;
implementation delays or a slow demand growth); and (ii) basic power prices and variables&#13;
difficult to quantify, such as the cost of unsupplied energy (see Table 5.1).&#13;
5.5   The ERR of MEA's investment program is relatively insensitive to the program's capital&#13;
cost and the quantum of electricity sales. The ERR also remains robust at 18.9% when the benefit&#13;
due to saving in "unsupplied energy" is not evaluated. The ERR is quite sensitive to the cost of&#13;
energy and to the WTP, being dependent on the difference between two parameters that have&#13;
close values.&#13;

B. RisKs&#13;
5.6   The project faces the following potential risks:&#13;
(a)   Delays in implementation - which could affect progress of industrial and&#13;
commercial development in the metropolis-as the detailed planning and design of&#13;
the distribution system expansion has been carried out and preparation of bid&#13;
documents has been completed for almost all of the procurement packages, and as&#13;
land for the new substations and right-of-ways for the transmission lines are&#13;
already available, the risk of implementation delays is considered small and&#13;
manageable.  However, if delays do occur, the quality of service to some&#13;
consumers would decline or, in the worst case, electricity sales would drop. The&#13;
impact of the latter case was tested and it was found that the project's economic&#13;
viability would not be affected (ERR= 18% for a 10% decline in sales);&#13;
(b)    Shortfall or lag in electricity demand - which could lead to wasteful investments-&#13;
the risk of demand not materializing as forecast is unlikely, given the development&#13;
potential of the area. Adjustments in investments could be readily made should&#13;
severe variations in demand projections so dictate. Furthermore, project benefits&#13;
would decline only during a short initial period. Therefore, overall the project's&#13;
economic performance is not likely to be affected by slow demand growth;&#13;
(c)   Cost Overruns - which could make the project economically unviable-this risk is&#13;
small as cost estimates are supported by a sound data bank which is continuously&#13;
updated by actual costs based on MEA's latest contracts. Further, the ERR is&#13;
robust enough to assure economic viability of the program for significant cost&#13;
overruns; and&#13;
(d)   Delays in implementing policy and institutional development components - (these&#13;
include MEA's institutional restructuring and development of DSM capabilities).&#13;
A possible risk associated with these components of the project would be waning&#13;
of MEA management commitment and actions in deploying resources (human,&#13;
financial and technical assistance) to develop and implement the proposed&#13;
programs. This could at best delay implementation and at worst result in dropping&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
one or more facets of the programs. Implementation delays would not significantly&#13;
affect the physical components of the project. Also, Government commitment to&#13;
the organizational restructuring of MEA is assessed to be strong.  The&#13;
Government is also concerned with improving the efficiency of electricity use in&#13;
Thailand and is highly supportive of Thailand's overall efforts at demand side&#13;
management and energy conservation. With continuing Government support and&#13;
focused Bank supervision efforts, it is expected that the possible risks to the policy&#13;
and institutional development components could be dealt with expeditiously if they&#13;
were to emerge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
A. AGREEMENTS&#13;
6.1   During negotiations, agreement was reached with MEA that it would:&#13;

consultation with the Bank, take any additional measures that would be called for&#13;
meet this requirement (para. 1.10);&#13;
(b)   carry out an annual review and update of its five-year investment program, discuss&#13;
this with the Bank, and implement the program taking into consideration the Bank's&#13;
comments (para. 1.12);&#13;
(c)   submit to the Bank audited annual financial statements within six months of the close&#13;
of each fiscal year (para. 2.20);&#13;
(d)   continue to make provisions satisfactory to the Bank for insurance against such risks&#13;
and in amounts consistent with appropriate practice (para. 2.21);&#13;
(e)   restructure its organization according to the Reorganization Plan (any revision of the&#13;
said Plan shall be subject to review and acceptance by the Bank), furnish documentary&#13;
evidence satisfactory to the Bank in support of the separation of "supply" and&#13;
"distribution" profit centers, and avail of technical assistance according to terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.31);&#13;

(i)   generate funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 25% of the annual&#13;
average of its capital expenditure incurred, or expected to be incurred, for that fiscal&#13;
year, the previous fiscal year, and the next following fiscal year (para. 4.14);&#13;
(j)    maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times (para. 4.16);&#13;
(k)   not incur further debt if such additional debt would raise its long term indebtedness to&#13;
more than 1.5 times its total capitalization (para. 4.16); and,&#13;
(1)   review by April 30 of every year the adequacy of its tariffs to produce the required&#13;
self-financing ratio, debt service coverage and debt/equity ratio obligations (para.&#13;

6.2   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that it would undertake a&#13;
periodic review and adjust MEA's tariffs as necessary to ensure that MEA earns the 25% self-&#13;
financing ratio (para. 4.14).&#13;
B. RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.3   The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$145 million to MEA with the&#13;
guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand. The loan would be single currency, US$ denominated, fixed&#13;
interest rate loan with standard amortization term and grace period, and interest rate for fixed rate&#13;
US$ single currency loans with an expected disbursement period of 3-6 years.&#13;

TEHAILAND&#13;
Metropolitan Distribution Reinforcement Project&#13;
Demand-Side Management Component&#13;
Background&#13;
1.   In 1992, the Government approved legislation establishing the Energy Conservation Promotion&#13;
Act, which increased the commitment and resources necessary to implement a comprehensive energy&#13;
efficiency program. The Act: (a) formalized the responsibilities of the Department of Energy&#13;
Development and Promotion (DEDP) as the IEVD Government agency for energy conservation; (b)&#13;
gave DEDP the authority to issue voluntary building energy codes and appliance efficiency standards;&#13;
(c) identified a class of large energy users as '"ontrolled facilities" and required that they hire energy&#13;
managers, conduct energy studies and develop energy conservation plans; and (d) established the&#13;
Energy Conservation Promotion Fund (ECF), financed largely through taxes on refinery products.&#13;
2.   In addition, by the approval of a motion put forward by the National Energy Policy Office&#13;
(NEPO), the Thai Cabinet gave EGAT the legal mandate and authority to pursue DSM programs,&#13;
targeting appliances in six categories that significantly contribute to Thailand's electricity demand&#13;
growth - lighting measures, air conditioners, refrigerators, freezers, ballasts and motors. In December&#13;
1992, the Demand-Side Management Office (DSMO) was created within EGAT to take charge in the&#13;
design, implementation and evaluation of DSM programs. The distribution utilities, MEA and the&#13;
Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), are also charged to cooperate with EGAT in DSM&#13;
implementation in their respective service territories.  The DSM  Sub-Committee (DSMSC) was&#13;
established to oversee the progress of DSM implementation.&#13;
3.   In recognition of the unique potential of the Thai DSM effort to serve as a model for energy&#13;
conservation and greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts in other countries, the World Bank under&#13;
the auspices of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has supported the Promotion of Electricity&#13;
Energy Efficiency Project since 1993. The project has two main objectives: (a) to build sufficient&#13;
institutional capability in the Thai electric power sector and the energy-related private sector to deliver&#13;
cost-effective energy services throughout the economy; and (b) to pursue policies and actions that&#13;
would IEVD to the development, manufacture and adoption of energy-efficient equipment and&#13;
processes within the country.&#13;
4.    The GEF project is substantially serving these objectives. With respect to the first objective of&#13;
building institutional capability, the GEF project has spearheaded the creation of the DSMO at EGAT&#13;
with 120 trained staff and successfully utilized the Thai Industrial Standard Institute (TISI) for testing&#13;
the energy efficiency of various appliances. With respect to the second objective of pursuing policies&#13;
and actions, the GEF project has begun implementation of several key DSM programs such as the high-&#13;
efficiency fluorescent tube, air conditioner, refrigerator, compact fluorescent lamp, green building and&#13;
motor programs. The DSMO estimated that, as of January 1997, these measures have achieved energy&#13;
savings of 1,009 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year, reduced the peak demand by 136 megawatts (MW)&#13;
and led to a 753,000 ton reduction in carbon dioxide (C02) emissions per year by avoiding energy&#13;
generation.&#13;
5.    However, DSM implementation in Thailand has, until now, been shouldered almost exclusively&#13;
by the DSMO in EGAT. There has been little involvement to date in DSM development and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 15&#13;
implementation on the part of distribution utilities, primarily due to lack of technical capabilities,&#13;
especially in the areas of customer load research and delivery of energy services using private sector&#13;
expertise such as energy service companies (ESCOs). In recognition of this, MEA has identified the&#13;
need to take an active role in promoting DSM, and has agreed to include DSM components in this&#13;
project in four areas: (a) ESCO development; (b) load research; (c) appliance testing; and (d) load&#13;
control.&#13;
Energy Service Company (ESCO) Development&#13;
6.    MEA has begun a process to restructure its Electrical Systems Services Department (EVD) into&#13;
a corporatized business unit. EVD is responsible for conducting electrical system design and wiring&#13;
services for customers (mostly public buildings) and electrical equipment maintenance services.&#13;
Currently, EVD is composed of about 400 staff, and has an annual revenue of about 400 million Baht&#13;
(or US$16 million).&#13;
7.    According to a draft restructuring plan prepared by consultants, EVD will be first corporatized&#13;
by the end of 1997, and may be privatized as a fully-owned subsidiary of MEA by 1999. Once&#13;
corporatized, EVD would have three divisions, namely engineering, financial, marketing groups. MEA&#13;
has proposed to study the spin off as a separate private entity when EVD is privatized in 1999. The&#13;
ESCO would engage in performance contracting projects.&#13;
8.    Performance contracting refers to the implementation of energy-efficient options using a private&#13;
sector service provider (generally an energy service company) who is compensated based on&#13;
demonstrated performance in reducing the energy use as a direct result of the installation of energy-&#13;
efficient equipment and the adoption of energy saving production processes. ESCOs offer complete&#13;
energy services, including preliminary feasibility analysis, detailed energy audits, design, installation,&#13;
finance and maintenance of energy-efficient technologies. Performance contracts are typically designed&#13;
to reduce risks to project facility owners because ESCOs are paid based on their performance; facility&#13;
owners pay for ESCO services based on the energy savings actually achieved.&#13;
9.    While the total required funding for ESCO projects in Thailand is largely dependent on the&#13;
demand for such services, level of investment required for each building and the number of eligible&#13;
buildings, it is expected that a minimum of US$10 million would be required to finance the initial ESCO&#13;
projects. A feasibility study is expected to identify potential sources of ESCO project financing,&#13;
including the ECF.&#13;
Load Research Program&#13;
10.   The introduction of a system-wide load research program to collect energy consumption data of&#13;
MEA customers will be designed to support the load profile needs of MEA, providing useful&#13;
information to assist MEA in its load forecasting and planning as well as its operational functions such&#13;
as DSM and tariff design and analysis. A detailed analysis was undertaken by a consultant to define the&#13;
sample requirements and equipment needs.&#13;
11.   To maintain statistical validity of load research sample, it was determined that a total of 1,225&#13;
customers (sample) from various customer classes would need to be monitored continuously, as shown&#13;
in the following table:&#13;

12.   The capital budget required for metering the 1,225 sites, with associated hardware and software,&#13;
is projected to be US$2.5 million. Initial training and technical assistance will require an additional&#13;
US$330,000. MEA will be requesting funding from the ECF to support this sub-component.&#13;
Appliance Testing Laboratory Development&#13;
13.   Testing the energy consumption and efficiency of electric appliances is the foundation of&#13;
successful implementation of DSM. EGAT has utilized the facilities of TISI to test electric appliances&#13;
such as refrigerators, air-conditioners and fluorescent tubes. TISI, however, does not currently have&#13;
capabilities for testing ballasts or motors. The preparation mission found that the current staffing and&#13;
space shortages prohibit TISI from expanding its capabilities to test motors and ballasts. The shortage&#13;
in staffing has also slowed the progress in testing air conditioners and refrigerators, which has delayed&#13;
various DSM initiatives under implementation by EGAT.&#13;
14.   MEA agreed to establish a laboratory to test the energy consumption and efficiency of motors,&#13;
ballasts, air conditioners and refrigerators, and agreed to provide space and staff for the operation of the&#13;
laboratory. An approximately 2,000 square meter facility within MEA service territory is currently&#13;
being considered for the laboratory site.&#13;
15.   It is estimated that approximately US$750,000 will be required to purchase motor testing&#13;
equipment. MEA estimates that about an additional US$200,000 will be required to procure ballast&#13;
testing equipment. The main equipment would include a humidity chamber test set for moisture&#13;
resistance and insulation, a Kelvin bridge for testing limitation of ballast heating and a digital power&#13;
analyzer for electronic ballast testing. Testing refrigerators and air conditioners can be simulated.&#13;
According to TISI, the investment requirement for air conditioner and refrigerator testing laboratory is&#13;
approximately US$1.4 million. NEPO has agreed in principal to finance the laboratory investment costs&#13;
from the ECF, estimated to reach about US$2.5 million (for equipment and installation only).&#13;
Load Control Program&#13;
16.   Direct control by the utility offers the advantage of curtailing demand only when system&#13;
conditions require reduction of peak demand, either to avoid capital investments to meet the peak&#13;
(either for generation or distribution) or as an operating aid under emergency conditions. The amount&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51                                       Annex 7&#13;
Page 4 of 15&#13;
and duration of the control devices can be determined by the utility to limit lost revenues and reduce&#13;
impacts on the customer. Another approach is to have customer owned energy management systems&#13;
with a load control feature, that would allow a utility to control the load when necessary.&#13;
17.   MEA agreed to create a load control program, involving the installation of control systems in&#13;
commercial customer premises, that would allow MEA to reduce the demand at pre-selected end-uses,&#13;
primarily air conditioners/chillers, when the generation and/or distribution systems require load relief&#13;
The load control systems would be installed primarily in DEDP-designated '"ontrolled facilities," or&#13;
buildings with a monthly demand of 1,000 kW or more. About 100 existing facilities and 150 new&#13;
buildings would likely participate in such a program.&#13;
18.   The total cost for the necessary equipment for this sub-component is estimated at about US$4.0&#13;
million. MEA expects to customers to pay for the equipment and installation costs of the control&#13;
devices. The GEF Grant will support a study to define the scope of the Load Control Program.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
19.   A grant fund US$1 million will be allocated from the existing GEF-supported Project -&#13;
Promotion of Electricity Energy Efficiency (GEF Grant No. TH-28637) to support technical assistance&#13;
(TA) activities for these DSM sub-components. Several TA components are envisioned including the&#13;
following:&#13;
20.   An ESCO Feasibility Study will be performed by an international consulting firm with a budget&#13;
of US$130,000 (see attached Terms of Reference). The feasibility study will:&#13;
(a) define the institutional requirements for privatizing the ESCO/performance contracting&#13;
group as a part of EVD privatization (or as a separate entity);&#13;
(b) provide a detailed business plan for the privatized entity, identifying performance&#13;
contracting projects in the commercial sector, required resources needs (e.g., staffing,&#13;
working capital);&#13;
(c) estimate the funding requirements for commercial sector ESCO projects;&#13;
(d) recommend suitable ESCO project funding mechanism; and&#13;
(e) recommend training programs for ESCO operation staff.&#13;
21.   The scope of the Load Control Program will be defined based on the recommendations of an&#13;
international consultant, funded by the Grant. A US$220,000 budget has been allocated to this study,&#13;
which will assist MEA in determining the number of interested participants in the Program,&#13;
recommending suitable operating arrangements, discuss cost recovery mechanisms and outline a training&#13;
program for MEA staff.&#13;
22.   Support to develop an Appliance Testing Laboratory in Bangkok will be financed by the GEF&#13;
Grant. Such preparatory work would include detailed cost estimates for testing equipment, a market&#13;
assessment for appliance testing services in Thailand and neighboring countries, a business plan,&#13;
laboratory design, staffing/training requirements and construction management (see attached Terms of&#13;
Reference). In addition, the Grant would fund a study tour for select MEA/EGAT staff to visit existing&#13;
international testing facilities. It is estimated that such support would require about US$400,000 from&#13;
the Grant.&#13;

Backeround&#13;
1.    Thailand has one of the world's fastest growing industrial economies. Over the last three years,&#13;
GDP growth has averaged 10% per annum and the outlook continues to be one of robust economic&#13;
expansion. In order to assure an adequate level of electricity supply to sustain growth, about 1,700&#13;
MW of generating capacity additions will be required annually to meet the power demand which is&#13;
projected to grow from 13,310 MW in 1996 to over 22,000 MW in 2001. To meet this challenge, the&#13;
Government's strategy calls for: (a) increasing power sector investments substantially; (b) accelerating&#13;
the pace of privatization of the power supply industry; (c) making a strong thrust towards energy&#13;
conservation; and (d) placing, increased emphasis on environmentally sound sustainable development.&#13;
2.    In 1993, the World Bank, in conjunction with the Global Environment Facility (GEF), approved&#13;
the Thailand Promotion of Electricity Energy Efficiency Project. The project has two major objectives:&#13;
(a) to build sufficient institutional capability in the Thai electric power sector and the energy-related&#13;
private sector to deliver cost-effective energy services throughout the economy; and (b) to pursue&#13;
policies and actions that would IEVD to the development, manufacture and adoption of energy efficient&#13;
equipment, and processes within the country. The Project, which is being implemented by the Demand-&#13;
Side Management Office (DSMO) within the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT),&#13;
consists of a five-year DSM Plan, with a budget of US$189.0 million. The Project has a savings target&#13;
of 238 MW and 1,427 GWh (per annum) of electricity by the end of 1997.&#13;
Proposed Metropolitan Power Distribution Reinforcement Project&#13;
3.    The proposed, World Bank-assisted Metropolitan Power Distribution Reinforcement Project is&#13;
designed to assist the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), the utility responsible for electricity&#13;
distribution to the Bangkok metropolitan area, to: (i) sustain the efficiency of MEA's operations in the&#13;
face of a rapid increase in the scope and complexity of its business (more specifically through assistance&#13;
in organizational restructuring in preparation for commercialization and corporatization); (ii) support&#13;
improvements and expansions in its distribution system to meet the rapid increase in demand at&#13;
enhanced levels of reliability, safety and environmental acceptability; and (iii) enhance the role of MEA&#13;
in demand-side management (DSM).&#13;
4.    MEA has identified the need to take an active role in promoting DSM which has, until now,&#13;
been shouldered almost exclusively by the DSMO in EGAT. As part of the proposed Project, MIEA has&#13;
agreed to implement four DSM components in the areas of: (a) load research program; (b) appliance&#13;
testing laboratory construction; (c) energy service company (ESCO) development; and (d) DSM&#13;
technical assistance/training program. These terms of reference (TOR) is prepared to conduct an ESCO&#13;
development within MEA.&#13;

MEA Restructuring/Prospects for ESCO Development&#13;
5.    MEA has begun a process to restructure its Electrical Appliance Services Department (EVD)&#13;
into a corporatized business unit. EVD is responsible for conducting electrical system design and wiring&#13;
services for its customers (mostly public buildings) and electrical equipment maintenance services.&#13;
Currently, EVD consists of about 400 staff, and has an annual revenue of about 400 million Thai Baht&#13;
(US$16 million).&#13;
6.    According to a draft restructuring plan, EVD will be first corporatized by end 1997, and may be&#13;
privatized as a fully-owned subsidiary of MEA by 1999. Once corporatized, EVD would have three&#13;
divisions: (i) engineering group; (ii) financial group; and (iii) marketing group. As part of the&#13;
restructuring process, MEA is interested in studying the feasibility of adding an ESCO operations group&#13;
in the corporatized structure, which could spin off as a separate entity when EVD is privatized. The&#13;
ESCO operations group would engage in performance contracting projects.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
7.    MEA has requested Bank support to conduct a feasibility study to identify a suitable institutional&#13;
framework, financing arrangements and a detailed business plan for an ESCO operations group within&#13;
MEA. This study will also assist MEA to: (a) define the products and services to be offered by the&#13;
ESCO operations group; (b) evaluate the risks associated with performance contracting in MEA&#13;
territory; and (c) define the institutional arrangement within MEA to promote private sector&#13;
participation in energy conservation in commercial properties in MEA territory.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
8.    An international Consultant, with expertise in the creation and operation of ESCOs, will be&#13;
required to assess the feasibility of developing an ESCO operations group within MEA. The assignment&#13;
will involve: (i) examining the institutional alternatives for establishing an ESCO operations group and&#13;
associated strategic, financial and organizational issues; (ii) assessing the market potential for energy&#13;
conservation products and services; (iii) providing a detailed business plan for the proposed ESCO&#13;
operations group; (iv) estimating the funding requirements for performance contracting projects; (v)&#13;
recommending suitable project funding mechanisms; and (vi) recommending a comprehensive training&#13;
program for MEA staff to support ESCO development.  A Report summarizing the business&#13;
development plan, along with institutional financing and training recommendations will be submitted to&#13;
MEA at the end of this feasibility study.&#13;
Task 1: Review Institutional Aspects&#13;
9.    The Consultant will examine the institutional issues associated with creating an ESCO&#13;
operations group within MEA. To this end, the Consultant will review all viable institutional&#13;
alternatives, including: (i) the ESCO operations group as a division of MEA (under EVD); (ii) the&#13;
ESCO operations group as a subsidiary of MEA; and (iii) MEA outsourcing all performance contracting&#13;
activities through a competitive process to unaffiliated companies. The Consultant will evaluate all&#13;
options, taking into account such issues as the market potential for ESCO services (see Task 2), project&#13;
financing requirements (see Task 4), tax implications, associated risks, and technical and managerial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 7 of 15&#13;
capabilities of MEA.  The Consultant will discuss these institutional alternatives with MEA and&#13;
recommend the optimal organizational arrangement for the proposed ESCO operations group.&#13;
Task 2: Evaluate Market Potential&#13;
10.   In July 1995, the Government issued the 'Royal Decree Prescribing Controlled Buildings"&#13;
promulgating regulations governing the requirements for energy use in '"designated facilities" or&#13;
buildings with a peak demand of over 1,000 kW. Owners of 'hew' designated facilities" must meet the&#13;
energy consumption requirements in the Code before the buildings become operational, while owners of&#13;
'former designated facilities" are given three years in which to comply with the Code. The latter group&#13;
of owners represent a potential target customer base for performance contracting activities.&#13;
11.   Based on this information along with other available information, the Consultant will assess the&#13;
market potential for ESCO/performance contracting services within MEA service territory. This Task&#13;
will require an evaluation of the market in Thailand for energy conservation products and services and&#13;
may include defining target customer groups, estimating the size and number of potential&#13;
ESCO/performance contracting projects, determining which products and services should be supplied&#13;
by the ESCO operations group, identifying the risks associated with performance contracting, assessing&#13;
the ability and willingness of customers to pay for such products and services, projecting market&#13;
growth, identifying future competition and determining the market share of MEA.&#13;
Task 3: Design Business Plan&#13;
12.   The Consultant will design a detailed business plan for the proposed ESCO: The business plan&#13;
must clearly define the objectives of, and products and services offered by, the ESCO operations group.&#13;
In addition, the consultant will discuss relevant business aspects of the ESCO operations group, which&#13;
may include required resources (e.g., staffing, working capital, technical/managerial expertise,&#13;
equipment software, etc.), potential performance contracting projects, marketing strategies, a timetable&#13;
for the creation on an ESCO operations group, and monitoring and verification techniques. In addition&#13;
to these issues, the business plan may include financial information, such as target rates of return and a&#13;
cash flow analysis for the first three years of operation.&#13;
Task 4: Determine Funding Requirements&#13;
13.   In addition to working capital, the Consultant will estimate the funding requirements for&#13;
ESCO/performance contracting projects. Once the market potential has been analyzed, the Consultant&#13;
will determine the required investments needed in commercial buildings. For example, if the Consultant&#13;
has identified market potential in the commercial building sector, investments in lighting, electrical&#13;
appliances and thermal measures may be included. These investments could be used for construction,&#13;
equipment procurement, maintenance and reimbursements for working capital used to develop the&#13;
project.   The analysis of funding  requirements will also  assist in defining  the scope of&#13;
ESCO/performance contracting projects.&#13;
l The Code lists requirements for two types of buildings: "former buildings" or buildings that began construction or&#13;
submitted construction requests prior to the enactment of the Code; and "new buildings," which began the&#13;
construction process after the Code came into effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 8 of 15&#13;
Task 5: Recommend Appropriate Funding Mechanisms&#13;
14.   The Consultant should recommend optimal funding mechanisms for performance contracting&#13;
projects. Once the level of investment for ESCO projects has been defined, the Consultant will&#13;
determine suitable funding altematives for such investments, such as debt (customer borrows), leasing&#13;
arrangements, ESCO financing (ESCO operations group borrows) and other arrangements. In addition,&#13;
the Consultant should examine the opportunity for financing from the Energy Conservation Fund&#13;
(managed by the National Energy Policy Office), MEA, commercial banks, and customers.&#13;
Task 6: Define Training Requirements&#13;
15.  In addition to performing Tasks 1 - 5 above, the Consultant will be required to assess the&#13;
capability of MEA ESCO staff and MEA management to establish and operate an ESCO operations&#13;
group. Based on this assessment, the Consultant will outline the necessary training program for relevant&#13;
ESCO staff to ensure that their individual assignments are performed adequately. The Consultant&#13;
should address this component in the proposal, with the ultimate objective of ensuring that at the&#13;
conclusion of this assignment: (i) staff of MEA's ESCO operations group are fully capable of operating&#13;
an ESCO; and (ii) MEA management has the capacity to establish and manage the ESCO operations&#13;
group. Training activities may include workshops, seminars, classes and other educational activities to&#13;
improve the local capabilities for ESCO development and operation and ensure the sustainability of&#13;
MEA's initiatives.&#13;
Schedules and Reporting Requirement&#13;
16.   The estimated budget for this assignment is about US$100,000. The Consultant will need to&#13;
hire a local M/E company to assist in identifying energy conservation opportunities to be provided by&#13;
ESCO, including site visits and data collection/preparation. The Consultant should also meet with the&#13;
DSMO of EGAT and the Department of Energy Development and Promotion (DEDP) who have been&#13;
responsible for energy conservation activities in the commercial sector. It is anticipated that the&#13;
duration of this assignment will be approximately 3 months. The Consultant will report to Mr. Preecha&#13;
Praimkit, Deputy Governor, MEA. Any questions on this TOR should be directed to Mr. Kasem&#13;
Imkasorn, MEA DSM project coordinator.&#13;
17.   One major Report will be required, summarizing the issues surrounding the recommended&#13;
institutional structure, business plan and financing arrangement of the proposed ESCO operations&#13;
group, along with the training program of relevant MEA staff. This Report will form the basis for&#13;
designing the ESCO development component of the Bank-assisted Project and will be submitted to&#13;
MBA and the end of this assignment.&#13;

Metropolitan Distribution Reinforcement Project&#13;
Appliance Testing Laboratory Feasibility Study&#13;
Terms of Reference - Consulting Services&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is responsible for the generation and&#13;
transmission of electricity in Thailand. With an installed capacity of approximately 14,000 MW, EGAT&#13;
operates as a bulk supplier of electricity and relies on the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and&#13;
the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) for retail distribution.2 MEA distributes electricity in the&#13;
Bangkok metropolitan area while PEA serves the rest of the country.&#13;
2.    In 1992, EGAT launched a demand-side management (DSM) program to curtail electricity&#13;
demand that is growing at 10% per year. The five year program (1993-1997) has a budget of US$189&#13;
million and a savings target of 700 MW and 3,400 GWh (per annum) by 1998.&#13;
3.    EGAT has the legal mandate and authority to acquire DSM resources. It has 10 individual&#13;
DSM programs under implementation, preparation or consideration. They are:&#13;
Under Implementation&#13;
* Air-conditioners&#13;
* Refrigerators&#13;
* Fluorescent Tube Lamps&#13;
* Existing Commercial Buildings&#13;
Under Preparation&#13;
* New Commercial Buildings&#13;
* Compact Fluorescent Lamps&#13;
* Motors&#13;
Under Consideration&#13;
* Low-Income Lighting&#13;
* Street Lighting&#13;
* Low-Loss Magnetic Ballasts&#13;
4.    To date, EGAT has used the Thai Industrial Standards Institute (TISI) to test refrigerators, air-&#13;
conditioners and fluorescent lamps for its DSM programs. However, staffing shortages at TISI have&#13;
been a constraint and delayed DSM implementation. In addition, the TISI laboratory lacks the&#13;
necessary equipment to test motors and ballasts which will be included in upcoming DSM programs.&#13;
5.    MEA is now in the process of preparing the World Bank-supported Metropolitan Distribution&#13;
Reinforcement Project, which is designed to: (i) support organizational restructuring in preparation for&#13;
commercialization and corporatization; (ii) support improvements and expansions in its distribution&#13;
system; and (iii) enhance the role of MEA in DSM.&#13;
2 With the exception of 12 large customers to whom EGAT supplies electricity direct.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page IO of 15&#13;
6.    In support of the DSM activities in the above Project, MEA has agreed to build and operate an&#13;
appliance testing laboratory to test refrigerators, air-conditioners, motors and ballasts for EGAT's DSM&#13;
programs and, possibly, other clients. TISI would continue to test lamps for EGAT's DSM programs.&#13;
7.    MEA has identified a site in metropolitan Bangkok for the proposed appliance testing laboratory&#13;
with an area of up to 2,000 square meters. It has developed preliminary cost estimates for the testing&#13;
equipment, including US$1.4 million for refrigerators and air-conditioners, US$750,000 for motors and&#13;
US$200,000 for ballasts. The National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) has agreed to fund this equipment&#13;
with a US$2.5 million grant from the Energy Conservation Fund (ECF).&#13;
Objectives&#13;
8.    The objectives of this assignment are to assess the feasibility of an appliance testing laboratory,&#13;
owned and operated by MEA, conduct the electric and mechanical design work and provide technical&#13;

laboratory's scope of operations.&#13;
Task 2:     Prepare a business plan for the laboratory.&#13;
Task 3:      Conduct equipment/instrument specification, lab layout and construction and building&#13;
design.&#13;
Task 4:     Identify staffing and training requirements.&#13;
Task 5:     Provide construction management support.&#13;
Task 1.      Conduct a market assessment and determine the laboratory's scope of operations&#13;
10.   The consultant shall conduct a market assessment to determine the level and nature of demand&#13;
for testing services that could be provided by MEA's appliance testing laboratory. The laboratory must&#13;
be financially self-sustaining, using revenues from testing services provided to EGAT and other clients.&#13;
11.   The market assessment should begin with EGAT. The consultant shall meet with officials from&#13;
EGAT's Demand Side Management Office (DSMO) to determine the level and nature of demand for&#13;
testing to support its DSM programs for refrigerators, air-conditioners, motors and ballasts. The&#13;
consultant should project revenues from testing these appliances to support DSM implementation.&#13;
EGAT will assist the consultant in estimating the testing fees which potential lab customers (e.g.,&#13;
EGAT, appliance manufacturers) would be willing to pay.&#13;
12.   Using the above information, the consultant shall determine whether EGAT's revenues are&#13;
sufficient to enable the laboratory to be financially self-sustaining. The market assessment should&#13;
include non-EGAT clients (e.g. government agencies and manufacturers) to estimate the level and&#13;
nature of demand for testing services that the laboratory could provide to these clients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
Annex 7&#13;

13.   The consultant should expand the scope of the market assessment in an incremental fashion.&#13;
Initially the market assessment should be restricted to testing the energy efficiency of refrigerators, air-&#13;
conditioners, motors and ballasts for EGAT. It can then be expanded to encompass, in incremental&#13;
fashion, a) other Thai clients, b) clients in other countries, and c) other services (e.g. other appliances,&#13;
safety testing, etc.).&#13;
14.   Based on the results from the market assessment, the consultant shall discuss with MEA options&#13;
for the laboratory' s scope of operations and related issues and risks. The consultant shall solicit MEA's&#13;
approval of a scope of operations for the laboratory that enables it to be financially self-sustaining.&#13;
15.   The deliverable from this task will be a statement of the laboratory's scope of operations (agreed&#13;
to by MEA), which would allow for full cost recovery and outline testing services to be offered and&#13;
clients or types of clients to be served.&#13;
Task 2:      Prepare a business plan for the laboratory&#13;
16.   The consultant shall prepare a business plan for the laboratory to support its initial operation. At&#13;
a minimum, the business plan should include:&#13;

New Bulk's Supply Tariff&#13;
Proposed Mechanism for New Bulk Supply Tariff&#13;
The current approach to setting the BST has been determined to have three significant&#13;
drawbacks. Firstly, by mixing the BST and the cross subsidy mechanism, neither MIEA nor PEA&#13;
face, at the margin, an accurate signal of the true cost of generation and transmission in their&#13;
respective regions. Secondly, this condition makes it very difficult to identify the scale of the&#13;
current financial transfer from MEA to PEA and hence, to identify either the underlying financial&#13;
position of either utility, or the true cost to MEA consumers of the uniform national tariff policy.&#13;
Lastly, the current approach risks weakening the efficiency incentives on PEA and MEA, the risk&#13;
being that both MEA and PEA may come to believe that additional costs which it incurs will be&#13;
compensated by a futher reduction in its BST and corresponding increase in the BST paid by the&#13;
other.&#13;
Clearly, a new mechanism is needed to deal with these drawbacks that would: (a) be&#13;
consistent with the overall approach to the Government's policy on tariff determination; (b)&#13;
enable the costs of the cross subsidy to be clearly transparent, identifiable and separable from the&#13;
BST; (c) leave all utilities with strong incentives to improve efficiency and reduce costs; and (d)&#13;
enable the BST to give both MEA and PEA an accurate signal of the true costs of generation and&#13;
transmission in their respective regions. A new mechanism, prepared by consultants of the BST&#13;
study, proposed the following changes: (a) EGAT would charge a common BST to PEA and&#13;
MEA which would reflect accurately the bulk cost of energy and capacity to both utilities; (b) the&#13;
cross subsidy would occur through separate financial transfer from MBA and EGAT to PEA&#13;
called the Uniform Tariff Compensation Payment (UTCP); (c) the UTCPs would not be a fund,&#13;
would always have a zero balance, and would be paid into and received from a single bank&#13;
account; and (d) the size of the UTCP will be determined by the regulator as part of the periodic&#13;
tariff review for each of the subsequent five years before the next review.&#13;
Proposed New Tariff Determination and Setting Process&#13;
Under the proposed system, BST and tariff levels would be determined using the allowed&#13;
revenue approach arrived at through six consecutive steps. Step 1 would determine the base&#13;
value of allowed revenue (Base Allowed Revenue) for generation, transmission, distribution and&#13;
retail activities in each year during the review period, based on forecast values for demand,&#13;
controllable and uncontrollable costs carried out by EGAT, MBA and PEA. Step 2, which would&#13;
also be carried out during tariff review, would derive the level of tariffs (Base Tariffs) for both&#13;
BST and final retail customers, required to recover the Base Allowed Revenue determined in Step&#13;
1, assuming forecast demand in each year. Step 3, carried out at the end of the first year&#13;
following the tariff review, would determine the Average Tariff Revenue recovered in the first&#13;
year, by multiplying the Base Tariffs determined in Step 2, by total actual demand for that year.&#13;
Step 4, also undertaken at the end of the first year, would calculate the value of revenue (Revised&#13;
Allowed Revenue) which would have been allowed in the first year if the uncontrollable costs and&#13;
demand had been correctly forecast when Base Allowed Revenue was determined in Step 1. Step&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
103&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
5 would determine the difference (Revenue Correction) between the Average Tariff Revenue&#13;
calculated in Step 3 and the Revised Allowed Revenue calculated in Step 4. Finally, Step 6 would&#13;
adjust the Base Tariffs for Year 2 of the review period taking into account the Revenue&#13;
Correction required in respect of Year 1, expressed as a constant percentage increase to the Base&#13;
Tariff Level. An illustration of the proposed process in given in page 3 of this annex.&#13;
The Base Allowed Revenue for generation, transmission, distribution and retail acitivities&#13;
would be determined by reviewing operating and investment costs of each utility, comparing them&#13;
against regional benchmarks, and adjusting these costs by a 4% efficiency improvement factor to&#13;
ensure that costs are aligned with acceptable regional standards. Then using EGAT, MEA and&#13;
PEA financial models, the total revenue would be calculated to meet the required financial&#13;
criteria. The financial performance criteria is critical in determining the revenue which each utility&#13;
would be allowed and takes into consideration the sufficiency of revenues to guarantee the&#13;
utilities' financial health, efficiency incentives, and simplicity of administration. Hence, the&#13;
following financial criteria would be used in the calculation: (a) a minimum SFR of 25%; (b) a&#13;
15% maximum ratio of short and medium term debt to total debt; (c) a 1.5x minimum debt&#13;
coverage ratio; (d) a 1.5x maximum debt to equity ratio; and (e) a 2.Ox minimum interest cover&#13;
ratio. On the basis of initial calculations, the utilities should be able to meet on average all&#13;
investment and operating costs over the period between reviews, however, it may not meet these&#13;
performance criteria in each year of the review period since the annual revenue requirements in&#13;
each year are smoothed to give a Base Allowed Revenue profile for each utility. While the&#13;
specific financial criteria are consistent with the Bank covenants under the respective Loan&#13;
Agreements, Bank covenants, however, are drafted on the basis of results of annual performance.&#13;
It is therefore likely that the utilities would either re-negotiate the relevant loan covenants to&#13;
recognize that criteria may not be met on an annual basis or adjust the values for the performance&#13;
criteria used to define annual revenue requirements to ensure that the smoothed profile for Base&#13;
Allowed Revenue allows the utilities to meet or exceed the covenanted criteria in each year of the&#13;
review period.&#13;
Uniform Tariff Compensation Payment&#13;
The UTCP under the new BST is the proposed mechanism designed to preserve the&#13;
national uniform tariff while providing comparable financial criteria for MEA and PEA and be&#13;
cost reflective signals to each utility through the BST. For each utility, the Base UTCP is the&#13;
difference between the Base Allowed Revenue for that utility and the revenue received from&#13;
national uniform cross-subsidized tariffs.  After deriving the actual UTCP for each utility,&#13;
payments or receipts are made through a UTCP account. The UTCP mechanism is expected to&#13;
be operated without further intervention from NEPO apart for its role in setting the Base UTCP&#13;
and monitoring the application of adjustment formulae.&#13;

            Thailand - Metropolitan Distribution
            Reinforcement Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Metropolitan
            Distribution Reinforcement Project are to: (i) improve the
            reliability of the distribution system and contain losses at
            current levels, while meeting the projected rapid increase
            in electricity demand; (ii) assist in the organization
            restructuring of the Metropolitan Electricity Authority
            (MEA) leading to its commercialization and corporatization;
            and (iii) introduce demand-side management (DSM)
            capabilities in MEA's organization thus deepening the
            DSM focus in the country's most rapidly growing area.
            The components of the project are the following: 1)
            investment component including transmission and distribution
            substation system; transmission line systems; and
            distribution system; 2) policy component providing for a
            major restructuring of MEA's organization; and 3)
            institutional development component comprising: (i) setting
            up of an Appliance Testing Laboratory; (ii) introduction of
            a system-wide Load Research program; (iii) implementation of
            a load control program; (iv) establishment of an Energy
            Service Company; and (v) technical assistance.
