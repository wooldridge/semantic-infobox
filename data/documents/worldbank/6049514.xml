This report was prepared under the overall guidance of Marlaine Lockheed, Manager,&#13;
Evaluation Group. The team was led by Heidi S. Zia.&#13;
&#13;
In the field, the project was conducted by team members Professor Mustapha Kamel Al-&#13;
Sayyid, Director of the Center for the Study of Developing Countries (CSDC), and Dr.&#13;
Sahar Tawila, Professor of Statistics at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science of&#13;
Cairo University. Team members in the field administered a questionnaire addressed to&#13;
former trainees of the World Bank Institute in Egypt, provided statistical analysis of the&#13;
data collected, and helped in the organization of three focus group meetings with select&#13;
categories of those trainees.&#13;
&#13;
The team benefited greatly from Dr. Ola El Khawaga and Reem Mansour at Cairo&#13;
University for organizing focus group meetings with select categories of trainees in Cairo&#13;
during July, 2003.     The authors are also grateful for important comments by peer&#13;
reviewer Chaoying Liu (IEG) and to Elina Manjieva and Humberto S. Diaz (IEG) for&#13;

                               EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Institute (WBI) seeks to enhance the capacity of its client countries by&#13;
providing policy advice, training courses, and knowledge services and products in key&#13;
development areas. Traditionally, WBI's approach to capacity enhancement emphasized&#13;
thematic (or sectoral) and knowledge (or learning) objectives. Over the past year,&#13;
however, in response to the challenges of achieving the Millennium Development Goals&#13;
and in support of the World Bank's Corporate aims, WBI modified its strategy and&#13;
structure by adding a country pillar to the previous thematic and knowledge/learning&#13;
pillars. As part of WBI's new direction, the World Bank Institute Evaluation Group&#13;
(IEG) initiated a retrospective study of FY01-02 programs for participants from Brazil,&#13;
Thailand, Egypt, Russia and Sri Lanka. This study reports the findings from this study&#13;
which will serve as a baseline for assessing the impact of future country focus programs&#13;
for Egypt. The evaluation adopts the conceptual model of estimating effectiveness and&#13;
impact used in the study, "Impact of WBI Client Programs, FY00-01".1&#13;
&#13;
This country-focused evaluation of WBI's learning activities in Egypt during FY01-02&#13;
sought answers to three questions:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· What is the relevance of WBI learning activities to Egypt's needs?&#13;
    Â· What is the effectiveness and impact of WBI learning activities in Egypt?&#13;
&#13;
    Â· What is the contribution of WBI learning programs/activities to building in-&#13;
        country capacity in Egypt? And how does this contribution compare with others&#13;
        delivered by other members of the development community?&#13;
&#13;
Specifically, the third research question seeks to determine the extent to which&#13;
knowledge and skills were acquired in WBI learning activities for participants from&#13;
Egypt and to identify the factors related to their use and its impact of the knowledge and&#13;
skills developed.&#13;
&#13;
                                          METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
The evaluation focused on learning activities attended by Egyptian participants during&#13;
FY01-02.      It was based on several sources and types of information, including:&#13;
participant questionnaires, participant focus group discussions, interviews with&#13;
Operational Staff working on Egypt (in Washington D.C. and Cairo), and relevant&#13;
operational and WBI documents.&#13;

                                                                                         vii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Extracted from the Client Registration System (CRS), the participant list had originally&#13;
identified 248 Egyptians attending a total of 31 WBI activities (Annex 1). Excluding&#13;
invalid entries, the adjusted response rate was 84 percent.2&#13;
&#13;
                          FINDINGS FROM WBI PARTICIPANTS&#13;
&#13;
Characteristics of the learning events:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· The learning events ranged in duration between 2-8 days (for 54 percent of&#13;
        interviewees), 9-19 days (for 38 percent of interviewees); for a very small number&#13;
        of interviewees (8 percent) the activity lasted only one day.&#13;
    Â· On the whole, the learning events were neither designed specifically for Egypt (73&#13;
        percent were not designed especially for Egypt) nor part of a series of activities&#13;
        (54 percent were not part of a series).&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Less than half of the participants developed an action plan during the training (48&#13;
        percent).&#13;
&#13;
    Â· For 35 percent of participants either no contact list was provided at all, or it was&#13;
        judged not to be useful. Of those who received contact lists only 23 percent found&#13;
        their list be highly useful.&#13;
&#13;
Characteristics of the participants:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Two thirds of the participants interviewed were males (67 percent) and divided&#13;
        almost equally between those older than 40 years and those younger than 40&#13;
        years.&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Respondents were predominantly from government (30 percent), universities and&#13;
        research institutions (27 percent); respondents from the private sector, NGO's and&#13;
        donor agencies accounted for the rest.&#13;
    Â· Senior management and top management staff accounted for 43 percent of the&#13;
        respondents,      while high level policy-makers or legislators constituted only 7&#13;
        percent of their total number.&#13;
&#13;
Relevance of WBI learning activities to Egypt's needs:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Over half of all participants perceived the topics covered by training to be highly&#13;
        relevant to the needs of Egypt (57 percent); of the remaining participants 36&#13;
        percent perceived a moderate degree of relevance while 7 percent thought the&#13;
        topics irrelevant.&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Participants from university/research institutions, the government, private&#13;
        organizations and donor agencies were more likely than participants from NGO's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2Excluding invalid entries, the number of total eligible respondents is reduced to 204, of which 171 were&#13;
successfully interviewed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
viii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       to perceive the topics covered in the WBI learning activity as relevant to the&#13;
       development needs of Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
   Â· Focus group discussions indicate that the a participant's proficiency in the&#13;
       language of instruction increases the extent to which the learning activity is&#13;
       perceived to be highly relevant to Egypt's needs; conversely, a lack of proficiency&#13;
       in the language of instruction decreases the participant's perception of the&#13;
       relevance of the activity.&#13;
   Â· Regression analysis supports the focus group findings, indicating that mastery of&#13;
       the language of instruction significantly increases perceived relevance.                In&#13;
       addition, helpful country level facilitators also raise the perceived relevance of the&#13;
       training.&#13;
&#13;
WBI activities contributing to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to&#13;
promoting gender equality, developing global partnerships for development, and&#13;
improving investment climate3 were perceived as relevant to Egypt's needs.&#13;
&#13;
Effectiveness of WBI learning activities:&#13;
&#13;
   Â· Perceived effectiveness of the WBI activities in Egypt was slightly above the&#13;
       average (4.83 in a scale of 1-7).&#13;
   Â· Participants found WBI activities to be mostly effective in: 1) raising&#13;
       awareness/understanding of development issues, 2) refining their existing&#13;
       knowledge, and 3) providing them with new information and encouraging&#13;
       networking.&#13;
   Â· Participants found WBI activities to be least effective in providing&#13;
       strategies/approaches to address: 1) the needs of their organization and 2) the&#13;
       needs of their country.&#13;
   Â· Less than one-third of the participants was aware of other learning activities with&#13;
       similar content offered by organizations, other than WBI, in Egypt. Of those&#13;
       participants aware of non-WBI programs and able to compare them with WBI,&#13;
       over 60 percent reported the same level of effectiveness between WBI and non-&#13;
       WBI programs.&#13;
   Â· The most important determinants of effectiveness were the perceived relevance of&#13;
       the learning event, the development of an action plan, and the facilitating factors&#13;
       of the work environment. Perceiving the training as highly relevant to Egypt's&#13;
       specific needs, preparing and action plan, and having helpful facilitators both in&#13;
       the organization and in the country all significantly raise effectiveness of the WBI&#13;
       activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3Although imp roving investment climate is not an MDG it is a World Bank corporate priority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               ix&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Usefulness of WBI learning activities:&#13;
&#13;
  Â· Overall use of the acquired knowledge and skills was low, well below the average&#13;
      (23 on a scale from 1-54). However, almost 80 percent of the participants&#13;
      reported that they discussed the issues raised during the WBI learning activities&#13;
      afterwards, either occasionally or thoroughly, at work.&#13;
  Â· Seventy-four percent of the participants who had developed an actionplan during&#13;
      the training used the action plan at work.&#13;
  Â· Participants found WBI activities most useful for raising others' awareness in&#13;
      development issues and for teaching purposes. They found the learning activities&#13;
      least useful in implementing country development strategies and changing or&#13;
      influencing legislation.&#13;
&#13;
  Â· The results of the regression analysis on use show consistently that use of the&#13;
      knowledge and skills acquired in WBI training is related to being from the central&#13;
      government, being familiar with the terminology of the course, developing an&#13;
      action plan, having helpful organizational facilitators and perceiving the course&#13;
      effectiveness as high.&#13;
  Â· For almost one-third of the participants, the country's general readiness for reform&#13;
      and innovation is a facilitating factor in implementing new knowledge and skills.&#13;
  Â· For the majority of the participants, work environment factors are rated neither&#13;
      helpful nor unhelpful in implementing the acquired knowledge.                However,&#13;
      resources and funding availability with the work organization and the incentive&#13;
      system are more likely to be barriers than facilitators for utilization of learning.&#13;
&#13;
Impact of WBI Learning Activities:&#13;
&#13;
  Â· About 30 percent of participants indicated that the WBI learning activity they&#13;
      attended led to an overall change in the specific area of the activity, 38 percent&#13;
      reported that the activity did not lead to any change and 32 percent did not know.&#13;
  Â· When applicable, WBI learning activities have the strongest positive&#13;
      influence/impact on research, teaching, and work practices.              The positive&#13;
      influence is least in the area of legislation or regulation, although WBI learning&#13;
      activities did contribute to consensus building which may be a precursor of&#13;
      legislative or regulatory change.&#13;
&#13;
  Â· Much of the variation in the impact of WBI activities can be explained by whether&#13;
      or not participants prepared an action plan, and the level of helpfulness of&#13;
      facilitators. Respondents who developed an action plan generally found greater&#13;
      overall influence of the WBI activities.&#13;
&#13;
               FINDINGS FROM OPERATIONAL COUNTERPARTS&#13;
&#13;
  Â· According to almost all of the operational counterparts interviewed, WBI is a&#13;
      small contributor to the overall national training effort in Egypt. Operational staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
x&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  emphasized, however, that the comparative advantage of WBI training in Egypt is&#13;
  in 1) high quality research, and 2) access to and linkages with alternative&#13;
  experiences from around the world.&#13;
Â· There is also a need for better communication between WBI management who set&#13;
  priorities and TMs and thematic leaders who must coordinate project activities&#13;
  and the organization and delivery of learning events.        There seems to be a&#13;
  disconnect between Management (whose focus is on developing Country Briefs)&#13;
  and TMs (whose focus is on project implementation and the delivery of increased&#13;
  participant days with less money).&#13;
&#13;
Â· While coordination between Operations and WBI has significantly improved&#13;
  since early FY02, there is a need for better communication between WBI staff and&#13;
  Operational staff concerning WBI's mission and methods. Interviews with&#13;
  operational task managers (TMs) indicate that while some felt that WBI's&#13;
  contribution was vital and should be increased even further, most had no idea&#13;
  what WBI was doing. Virtually, none of the TMs were informed of the results of&#13;
  WBI operations in their countries.&#13;
&#13;
 KEY FINDINGS FROM FOCUS GROUP MEETINGS WITH PARTICIPANTS&#13;
&#13;
Â· Participants identified three country specific barriers that hinder the effective use&#13;
  of knowledge and skills of WBI activities in Egypt: 1)rigid hierarchy in decision&#13;
  making process of public sector organizations, 2) slow knowledge sharing process&#13;
  within organizations, and 3)the participants' proficiency in the language of&#13;
  instruction.&#13;
Â· Focus group participants' had several messages for WBI task managers: 1) The&#13;
  Egyptian public sector is not yet computerized and course material should be&#13;
  mailed in advance of start dates, 2) budgetary restrictions limit travel for training&#13;
  and TMs should try to minimize travel, 3) to promote real change, the base of&#13;
  Egyptians (both lower and higher level) should be broadened, and 4) one shot&#13;
  deals do not work Â­ WBI activities need systematic follow-ups.&#13;

&#13;
1.1     The World Bank Institute (WBI) seeks to enhance the capacity of its client&#13;
countries by providing policy advice, training courses, and knowledge services and&#13;
products in key development areas.               Traditionally, WBI's approach to capacity&#13;
enhancement emphasized thematic (or sectoral) and knowledge (or learning) objectives.&#13;
Over the past year, however, in response to the challenges of achieving the Millennium&#13;
Development Goals and in support of the World Bank's Corporate aims, WBI modified&#13;
its strategy and structure by adding a country pillar to the previous thematic and&#13;
knowledge/learning pillars.&#13;
&#13;
1.2     In FY02, the Institute adopted a "country focus" for its activities, linking them&#13;
directly to the countries' own poverty reduction strategies and to the Bank's country&#13;
assistance strategies. In it's latest Update on Strategic Directions and Progress to the&#13;
Board of Executive Directors, WBI argues that it will achieve its greatest impact on&#13;
client countries' capacity by: a) building medium to long-term relationships with&#13;
countries which b) tailor WBI programs to country priorities and c) provide strategically&#13;
coordinated sets of activities (rather stand-alone training courses) targeted to build&#13;
capacity at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
1.3     In line with the country focus approach, WBI identified 45 countries for overall&#13;
WBI priority, of which twelve "focus countries" were selected for intensive, continuous,&#13;
longer-term, multisectoral capacityÂ­building activities through FY06. These countries,&#13;
representing all six regions, were selected on the basis of three criteria: their readiness as&#13;
clients, WBI's relations with the countries and in-country partners, and the "rapid results"&#13;
collaboration mode (or the overall discipline in translating intent/learning into action).         4&#13;
&#13;
The twelve focus countries are:&#13;

                                                                                                 1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.4     The Institute's country focus strategy poses significant challenges for monitoring&#13;
and evaluation (M&amp;E) of upcoming country-level programs. The new M&amp;E approach&#13;
will be prospective and requires IEG to:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Establish local country partners for undertaking monitoring and evaluation with&#13;
        local partners who will be involved in linking outcomes to inputs;&#13;
    Â· Collect base line data necessary for measuring country level impact in future&#13;
        years.&#13;
&#13;
1.5     As part of WBI's new direction, IEG initiated a retrospective study of FY01-02&#13;
programs in Brazil, Thailand, Egypt, Russia and Sri Lanka.          This study reports the&#13;
findings of the retrospective study of WBI's Egypt program and will serve as the baseline&#13;
for the prospective evaluation work in that country.&#13;
&#13;
1.6     These findings are presented in the following seven chapters, which discuss the&#13;
following issues on the basis of responses to questionnaire, as follows:&#13;

   2. EVALUATION QUESTIONS AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
2.1    Overall, the country-focused evaluation sought answers to three questions:&#13;
&#13;
   Â· What is the relevance of WBI learning activities to the country's needs?&#13;
   Â· What is the effectiveness and impact of WBI learning activities?&#13;
&#13;
   Â· What is the contribution of WBI learning programs/activities to building in-&#13;
       country capacity? And how does this contribution compare with others delivered&#13;
       by other members of the development community?&#13;
&#13;
2.2    Specifically, the third research question seeks to determine the extent to which&#13;
knowledge and skills were acquired in the WBI learning activities in Egypt and to&#13;
identify the factors related to the use and impact of the knowledge and skills acquired.&#13;
&#13;
2.3    Table 2 on the following page lists the main evaluation questions, along with their&#13;
sub-questions, sources of information and unit of analysis pertaining to each question.&#13;
The evaluation was based on several sources and types of information, including:&#13;
participant questionnaires, participant focus group discussions, interviews with&#13;
Operational Staff working on Egypt (from Washington D.C. and Cairo), and relevant&#13;
operational and WBI documents.&#13;
&#13;
                              CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
2.4    To answer the evaluation questions, the study adopts (with some modifications)&#13;
the conceptual model of estimating effectiveness and impact developed in 2002 by&#13;
Khattri et al. In the conceptual model, the ultimate impact of the WBI learning activities&#13;
is measured by two indicators:&#13;
&#13;
   Â· The extent to which learning is used in the areas of teaching/research, policy/&#13;
       legislation, at work and, in raising others' awareness of development issues;&#13;
   Â· The extent to which these learning activities have influenced teaching/research,&#13;
       policy legislation and, work practices at the level of organizations.&#13;
&#13;
2.5    Impact of the WBI learning activities is determined by four sets of variables:&#13;
&#13;
   Â· Characteristics of participants in WBI learning activities together with main&#13;
       features of these learning activities. This set of variables is conceptualized to&#13;
       have a direct effect on impact. In addition, they have an indirect effect on impact&#13;
       as they are considered determinants of perceived relevance and effectiveness;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     Â· Course characteristics and WBI input variables such as level of attendance,&#13;
          development of an action plan during the activity and design for the participants;&#13;
     Â· Perceived relevance of WBI learning activities and effectiveness of these&#13;
          activities, and;&#13;
&#13;
     Â· Facilitators and barriers at the country level and at the level of the work&#13;
          organization.&#13;

&#13;
                                         THE PARTICIPANT SURVEY&#13;
&#13;
2.6       Questionnaires were administered to former participants in WBI-sponsored&#13;
activities, operational task managers in the MNA region, and WBI staff. Focus group&#13;
discussions and documentary analysis were utilized to probe the potential impact of the&#13;
learning activities on sectoral policies, programs, and practices. Interviews were carried&#13;
out with partners in the field to examine in more detail WBI's contributions and&#13;
comparative advantages in enhancing country capacity.&#13;
&#13;
2.7       The structured questionnaire administered to former participants in WBI-&#13;
sponsored activities comprised four main sections:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Â· Section I: Usefulness of WBI learning activities encompassing effectiveness,&#13;
        overall change and area-specific change led by these activities, use of learning in&#13;
        different areas, facilitators and barriers to the use of learning.&#13;
    Â· Section II: Relevance of the WBI learning activities to the needs of the country as&#13;
        perceived by the participants and also as they relate to the Millennium&#13;
        Development Goals.&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Section III: Comparison of WBI learning activities with similar activities offered&#13;
        by other organizations.&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Section IV: Characteristics of the learning event and of the participant.&#13;
&#13;
                          PARTICIPANT SURVEY RESPONSE RATES&#13;
&#13;
2.8     The participant list had originally 248 Egyptians attending a total of 31 WBI&#13;
activities in 13 programs.            Given the small population size, we chose the entire&#13;
population for the purposes of this study. Excluding invalid entries, the number of total&#13;
eligible respondents is reduced to 204, of which 171 were successfully interviewed. The&#13;
adjusted response rate was 84 percent.5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5Invalid entries comprised repetitions, participants who did not attend the learning activity, were&#13;
organizers/ instructors/ administrative assistants or are not currently based in Egypt and their contact&#13;
information abroad is not available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         5&#13;

&#13;
                          PARTICIPANTS' CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
&#13;
3.1    The participants' survey collected basic information on the individual&#13;
characteristics of the respondents, mainly;&#13;
&#13;
   Â· Demographic characteristics: sex, age;&#13;
&#13;
   Â· Work-related characteristics: type of organization, type of work, position at work;&#13;
   Â· Participant qualifications: proficiency in the language of instruction, proficiency&#13;
       in the terminology used in the learning activity;&#13;
   Â· Interest in the learning activity: active participation in the learning event,&#13;
       participation in follow-up activities arranged by participants.&#13;
&#13;
The majority of participants were male.&#13;
&#13;
3.2    As shown in the Figures 1 and 2, of the 171 Egyptian participants interviewed,&#13;
approximately two-thirds (64 percent) are males and the group is almost divided equally&#13;
by age among those less than 40 years old and those more than 40 years old.&#13;

Participants came predominantly from government or universities/research&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
3.3    As shown in Figure 3 almost a third of the participants (30 percent) work in&#13;
organizations that are part of the central government of Egypt. The second largest&#13;
category of participants is affiliated to universities or research institutions (27 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Participants from the private sector (mainly working in finance and banking) comprise 12&#13;
percent each, while those from the regional/local governments or from NGO's contribute&#13;
7 percent each to the total number participating in the designated learning activities.&#13;
Participants from donor agencies constitute about 4 percent only of all participants.&#13;

Proficiency of the language and terminology of instruction was relatively high, but&#13;
not high enough.&#13;
&#13;
3.6     English was the language of instruction for the majority of learning events. As&#13;
Figure 6 shows, two-thirds of the participants indicated a high proficiency in the language&#13;
of instruction while most of the remaining one-third reported a moderate level of&#13;
proficiency. Figure 7 indicates that 53 percent of the participants reported high&#13;
proficiency in the terminology used during the learning event, while 40 percent reported&#13;
moderate proficiency, and 7 percent indicated a low level of proficiency.&#13;

                 FEATURES OF THE WBI LEARNING ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
3.8     Participants in the survey provided information concerning 26 WBI learning&#13;
activities offered between the summer of 2000 and the summer of 2002.                  This&#13;
information includes:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Duration of the activity;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Whether the activity was specially designed for participants from Egypt;&#13;
    Â· Whether the activity was part of a series;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Whether it involved development of an action plan/strategy to apply the&#13;
        knowledge acquired;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Â· Provision of a contact list of participants;&#13;
&#13;
      Â· Type of follow-up contacts; and&#13;
      Â· Circulation of a newsletter related to the activity.&#13;
&#13;
The majority of the activities took place over several days.&#13;
&#13;
3.9      As shown in Figure 10, one-day learning activities comprise 11 percent of all&#13;
learning activities studied. The majority extends for either 2-8 days (36 percent) or 9-19&#13;
days (54 percent).6&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
3.10     As indicated in Figures 11 and 12, only about 27 percent of these activities were&#13;
specially designed for participants from Egypt and less than one-half (46 percent) of them&#13;
were part of a series of learning activities.7 The fact that WBI activities were not country&#13;
specific, is not surprising, given that WBI's course designs were neither country focused&#13;
nor based on the CASs. WBI's adoption of a country focused approach is welcomed by&#13;
focus group participants who voiced their concern that their learning activity was not in&#13;
any way tailored to Egypt. In the words of one participant, "courses that come with an&#13;
agenda that `one size fits all' will not work - they are simply too general. We need&#13;
training that addresses Egypt's problems and offers solutions that are within the&#13;
constraints of our country."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6 While the list of FY01-02 Egyptian participants excluded those who attended one day training courses,&#13;
still when asked about the duration of the course 11 percent of the participants indicated that their activity&#13;
was one day long. This may or may not be a CRS problem. Also the large percentage associated with&#13;
training activities between 9-19 days are due to two heavily subscribed distance learning activities that&#13;
extended over two weeks&#13;
7In terms of percent of participants, 31 percent of partic ipants reported that the activity was designed for&#13;
Egyptians.&#13;

developed action plan or strategies to apply the knowledge acquired .&#13;

The contact information provided was considered moderately useful and follow-up&#13;
contacts were rare.&#13;
&#13;
3.12    To gauge the sustainability of the learning activities, participants were asked (a)&#13;
whether they received a contact list; (b) whether the contact list was useful; and (c)&#13;
whether they had received follow-up contacts from the organizers. As indicated in Figure&#13;
14, participants considered the list of contact information highly useful in 23 percent of&#13;
the cases, moderately useful in 43 percent of the cases, and either not provided or not&#13;
useful in 35 percent of the activities.&#13;

3.13     Follow up contacts were infrequent and rarely face-to-face; Figure 15 shows that&#13;
40 percent of participants were subsequently contacted and only 11 percent had face-to-&#13;
face follow-up contact. In focus groups, participants voiced their concern about lack of&#13;
follow-up and their disappointment in learning that their training was "a one shot deal".&#13;
Furthermore, participants felt that a single course, while informative, was not enough to&#13;
produce real change in existing practices at organizational and/or even an individual&#13;
level; real change would need systematic follow-up.&#13;

                         ACTIVITIES' CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
&#13;
3.15   The WBI learning activities in which Egyptians participated are listed in Annex 1.&#13;
Most Egyptians participated in activities related to infrastructure finance, sustainable&#13;
development and food security, monitoring and evaluation, and marketing and trade&#13;
communications. Health, agriculture and irrigation, education, safety nets and pensions&#13;
funds are also examples of topics of courses that were attended by Egyptians. It is also&#13;
noticeable that five out of 31 activities (16%) of the activities in which Egyptians took&#13;
part were held in Egypt.&#13;

   4. RELEVANCE OF WBI LEARNING ACTIVITIES TO&#13;
                                     EGYPT'S NEEDS&#13;
&#13;
           PERCEIVED RELEVANCE OFWBI LEARNING ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
4.1    All Egyptian participants in WBI learning activities that took place between the&#13;
summer of 2000 and the summer of 2002 were asked about the degree of relevance of the&#13;
topics covered in the activity to Egypt's specific needs. Relevance was measured on a 7-&#13;
point scale ranging from "Extremely Irrelevant" to "Extremely Relevant". Responses&#13;
related to perceived relevance of the topics covered were then regrouped into the&#13;
following three categories:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Irrelevant (scale points 1 and 2);&#13;
    Â· Moderately relevant (scale points 3,4 and 5); and&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Highly relevant (scale points 6 and 7).&#13;
&#13;
Most participants perceived the learning activity to be relevant to Egypt's needs.&#13;
&#13;
4.2    On the average relevance was perceived as high with a mean rating of 5.44.&#13;
Figure 17 below indicates that over half of all participants (57 percent) perceive the&#13;
topics covered to be highly relevant while 36 percent perceive a moderate degree of&#13;
relevance and only 7 percent think these topics are irrelevant. Since the learning events&#13;
neither focused specifically on Egypt nor targeted Egyptian participants or their unique&#13;
development needs, the participants' perceived relevance of WBI's activities could be&#13;
considered as very high.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                                    7% irrelevant&#13;

                             High                                36%&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
But relevance was perceived as low by participants from NGOs and the private&#13;
sector and by participants with low/moderate language proficiency.&#13;
&#13;
4.3     As suggested by Figure 18, the relationship between perceived relevance of the&#13;
topics covered in the learning activity and the type of organization of the participant is&#13;
significant. Participants from university/research institutions, from the government, from&#13;
private organizations and those from donor agencies seem to be more likely to perceive&#13;
the topics covered in the WBI learning activity highly relevant to the development needs&#13;
of Egypt compared to participants from NGO's.&#13;

event lower than those with a high proficiency in the language of instruction.&#13;

                      DETERMINANTS OF THE PERCEIVED RELEVANCE&#13;
&#13;
4.5      Regression analysis was used to evaluate what drives perceived relevance of the&#13;
activity controlling for participant demographic characteristics, course characteristics and&#13;
factors in the work environment that jointly are likely to influence perceived relevance.8&#13;
The results of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on relevance are presented in&#13;
Table 3. The dependent variable, relevance, ranges from 1 "Extremely Irrelevant" to 7&#13;
"Extremely Relevant" to Egypt's specific needs. A variable description and summary&#13;
statistics of the variables used in all of the regression analyses are presented in Annex 2.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Language proficiency and country facilitators are the most important determinants&#13;
of relevance.&#13;
&#13;
4.6      Perceived relevance can partly be explained by the language proficiency of the&#13;
participants, their perception that the course was designed for Egyptians, and the&#13;
influence of certain country-level facilitating factors, including the country's general&#13;
readiness for change and the potential "helpfulness" of the country's policies, social&#13;
groups and political groups for implementing the ideas covered in the learning activity.&#13;
Mastering the language of instruction raised perceived relevance (Ã=0.300, t=2.36), as&#13;
&#13;
8The participants were asked to rate the level of helpfulness of organizational (micro) and country level&#13;
(macro) work environment factors in implementing the knowledge and skills from the course. If the&#13;
average rating of a work environment factor is high it is perceived as a facilitator; if it is low it is said to be&#13;
a barrier in implementing the new knowledge and skills. Facilitators and barriers are discussed in depth in&#13;
section 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
did design (Ã=0.495, t=1.69) (although design is only significant at the ten percent&#13;
significance level), and helpful country level facilitators (Ã=0.433, t=3.49). In contrast to&#13;
the descriptive statistics, the regression analysis shows no significant effects on perceived&#13;
relevance of the type of organization (university/research or central government) of the&#13;
participants.&#13;
&#13;
4.7      Similar to the regression findings, focus group interviews state that the usefulness&#13;
and relevance of training are a function of the linguistic aptitude of participants. In focus&#13;
groups, participants suggested that WBI should seriously consider the possibility of&#13;
conducting its training for the Egyptians (and the Arab world at large) in Arabic.9&#13;
Participants also indicated that for activities taught in English, availability of information&#13;
on the learning activity before hand could enhance its usefulness.                     If non-English&#13;
speaking trainees are informed well ahead of time about the nature and content of the&#13;
training event, they could prepare well for it, and this would increase both its usefulness&#13;
and impact. The distribution of perceived relevance by level of language proficiency is&#13;
presented in Figure 19.&#13;

                                       MILLENNIUM GOALS&#13;
&#13;
4.8      The participant survey investigated whether the developmental goals of WBI&#13;
learning activities were closely related to the 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),&#13;
and three other WB corporate priorities, and if so, the extent to which the key issues in&#13;
achieving each goal were addressed. The development goals are presented in Table 4.&#13;

&#13;
9This is particularly true for DL courses where the language barrier becomes more of problem when sites&#13;
are connected globally and different accents come into play.&#13;
10The goals Ensure Water Sanitation and Supply, Improve Investment Climate and Finance and Promote&#13;
Trade are not Bank MDGs per se but rather WB corporate priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
WBI learning activities are perceived as most related to: 1) developing global&#13;
partners hips and 2) improving investment climate and finance.&#13;
&#13;
4.9     As shown in Figure 20, according to the participants, the WBI learning activities&#13;
they attended are hardly related to the goals of combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other&#13;
diseases, achieving universal primary education, reducing child mortality or improving&#13;
maternal health.        A higher percent of participants (17-32 percent) attended learning&#13;
activities that are related to the goals of promoting gender equality and empowering&#13;
women, ensuring water sanitation and supply, ensuring environmental sustainability,&#13;
promoting trade, or eradication of extreme poverty. Over-half of the participants reported&#13;
that the activities they attended were related to the goals of developing global&#13;
partnerships for development or improving investment climate and finance.&#13;

&#13;
Relationship between activity content and the remaining MDGs is low.&#13;
&#13;
4.10    Participants who reported that the learning activity they attended was related to a&#13;
specific millennium goal were asked about the extent to which the key issues in achieving&#13;
that goal were addressed, using a scale from 1 to 7. The responses were then regrouped&#13;
into two categories: low/not extensively addressed (less or equal to 5) and addressed&#13;
deeply/extensively (greater or equal to 6).&#13;
&#13;
4.11    As shown in Figure 21, whenever any of the three goals of developing global&#13;
partnerships for development, improving investment climate and finance or promoting&#13;
trade are related to the learning activity, close to one-half of the participants reported&#13;
extensive/deep coverage of the key issues in achieving these goals. Reports of extensive&#13;
coverage are less (38-52 percent) if the activity is related to the goals of developing&#13;
global partnerships, ensuring water sanitation and supply, improving investment climate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                   19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and finance and promoting trade. Key issues in achieving the remaining millennium&#13;
goals - when related to the activity attended - are not covered extensively at all. When&#13;
interpreting the extent to which the activities attended were perceived as related to the&#13;
development goals it is important to keep in mind that most Egyptians participated in&#13;
activities infrastructure finance, sustainable development, food security and trade,&#13;
poverty monitoring and evaluation and marketing communications (see Annex 1 and the&#13;
discussion in Chapter 3). It is not surprising that so many participants rated the course&#13;
they attended as related to improving investment climate and finance and promoting trade&#13;
as so many Egyptians attended activities on these topics.&#13;
&#13;
4.12    Examination of the relationship between the participants' perceived relevance of&#13;
the topics covered in the learning activity and whether the activity was related to each of&#13;
the development goals reveals that none of these relationships are significant.                                                                                         This&#13;
means that the participants' assessment of the relevance of the topics covered is not based&#13;
primarily on whether the learning activity is related to any of the millennium goals per se.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
4.13    Given that none of the FY01-02 activities were intended to actually focus on the&#13;
specific needs of Egypt it is interesting to study how country focused the activities were&#13;
in practice. We define an activity as being country focused if most of the following&#13;
aspects of the activity and its participants are true:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.14    Aspects of the activities:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· The activity took place in Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
    Â· A large number of the participants were Egyptians.&#13;
    Â· The activity was aligned with the Egypt CAS priorities.&#13;
&#13;
4.15    Aspects of the participants:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· The participants perceived the activity as designed especially for Egyptians.&#13;
&#13;
    Â· The participants perceived the relevance of the activity to Egypt's needs as high.&#13;
&#13;
4.16    At the activity level, we conclude that the WBI activities with Egyptian&#13;
participants were somewhat country focused. The activities with the largest number of&#13;
Egyptians took place in Egypt and 69 percent of Egyptians attended activities with 11 or&#13;
more Egyptian participants. Also, 60% of the activities focused on the key objectives&#13;
outlined in the 2001 Egypt CAS. These key objectives were: poverty, environment,&#13;
investment climate, trade and infrastructure finance.&#13;
&#13;
4.17    At the participant level, only 31 percent of the questionnaire respondents&#13;
perceived the activity they attended as designed for Egyptian participants. Over ninety&#13;
percent, however, reported that the activity they attended was either highly relevant (57&#13;
percent) or moderately relevant (36 percent) to Egypt's unique needs.&#13;
&#13;
4.18    From a total of 31 activities, only three were rated as activities that were&#13;
specifically designed for Egyptians. Of the remaining, seventeen were perceived as not&#13;
designed specifically for Egyptians, and eleven were not rated. The fact that participants&#13;
did not view the activities as specifically designed for Egypt, however, did not mean that&#13;
the courses were not relevant. Onthe contrary, fourteen activities out of 31 were rated as&#13;
highly relevant, five were rated as moderately relevant and no activities were rated as&#13;
irrelevant. 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.19    In sum, the WBI activities for Egyptians met three of the conditions for being&#13;
country focused. In addition, the CAS condition was partly met. Except for the activities&#13;
not being perceived to be designed especially for Egyptians, the WBI activities with&#13;
Egyptian participants were relatively country focused. In the following sections we&#13;
further investigate whether perceived (by the participants) country focus is related to&#13;
higher perceived effectiveness, usefulness or impact of the WBI courses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11The relevance of 12 activities were not rated by the participants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       21&#13;

        5.     EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WBI LEARNING&#13;
                                        ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
5.1     The survey instrument measured six different aspects of perceived effectiveness&#13;
from the WBI learning activities:&#13;
&#13;
   Â· Raising participants' awareness/understanding of development issues;&#13;
&#13;
   Â· Updating/refining participants' existing knowledge;&#13;
   Â· Providing participants with new knowledge/skills;&#13;
&#13;
   Â· Helping in networking among people with common interests;&#13;
   Â· Providing strategies/approaches to address the development needs of the country;&#13;
&#13;
   Â· Providing strategies/approaches to address the needs of the participants'&#13;
        organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Perceived effectiveness of the learning activities was medium to high.&#13;
&#13;
5.2     Effectiveness of the learning activity with regard to each aspect was measured&#13;
using a 7-point scale. Responses were then averaged over the six areas and regrouped&#13;
into three categories: low effectiveness (below 3), moderate effectiveness (between 3-5)&#13;
and, high effectiveness (above 5). On average, effectiveness was perceived as medium to&#13;
high with a mean of 4.83. The distribution of respondents by the three effectiveness&#13;
categories is depicted in Figure 22.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
5.3     Participants' responses regarding the level of effectiveness of the learning&#13;
activities suggest that these activities are most effective in the areas of: raising&#13;
awareness/understanding          of    development            issues,     refining        participants'     current&#13;
knowledge, providing new information, and encouraging networking.                                      WBI learning&#13;
activities are least effective in providing strategies/approaches to address the needs of the&#13;
participant's organization or to address the country's development needs. However, as&#13;
shown in Figure 23, the overall differences in the distribution of the level of effectiveness&#13;
in the designated six areas are not large. This is emphasized by the very close values of&#13;
the means and the standard deviations of all six variables.&#13;

&#13;
5.4     Focus group discussions of effectiveness distinguished between government and&#13;
private sector participants. Government participants indicated that the lack of&#13;
effectiveness in areas of providing strategies/approaches is due less to the nature of the&#13;
learning event itself than to the complexity of changing public policies or the investment&#13;
climate in the country. Such change could be a function of the power such trainees hold&#13;
in their country, and also of the general economic, social and political conditions&#13;
prevailing in it, which could improve or deteriorate independently of the skills of the&#13;
middle level government officials. According to private sector participants, on the other&#13;
hand, new knowledge is more easily translated into action and change, particularly&#13;
among those who were themselves trainers in the private sector or in international&#13;
organizations, or university professors who could use skills or knowledge they acquired&#13;
in training in their professional activities. They are in a situation characterized by control&#13;
of their professional environment, quite the opposite of the environment faced by middle&#13;
level government officials or private sector managers.&#13;

5.5      Factor analysis was applied to the data to reduce the dimensionality of the&#13;
measurement of the level of effectiveness of the WBI learning activities. Results of the&#13;
factor analysis emphasize the significant correlations and the minor differences between&#13;
the levels of effectiveness in the six designated areas.                              The analysis concludes by&#13;
extracting one factor only that summarizes the overall level of effectiveness for each&#13;
participant. Overall effectiveness is measured using the average of the six effectiveness&#13;
areas. Averaging the areas is possible because data on effectiveness is complete.12&#13;
&#13;
                            REGRESSION ANALYSIS OFEFFECTIVENESS&#13;
&#13;
5.6      Testing the relationship between each of the six dimensions of effectiveness of the&#13;
learning activity and the perceived relevance of the topics covered to the country's needs&#13;
indicate that all these relationships are significant (P-value less or equal to 0.01).&#13;
&#13;
5.7      In addition to the analysis of relevance, an OLS regression analysis was employed&#13;
to evaluate what determines perceived course effectiveness. The results of the regression&#13;
on effectiveness are presented in Table 5. Perceived effectiveness, the dependent&#13;
variable, ranges from 1 through 7.&#13;

12A large number of observations rated as "Don't Know" were recoded to 4, the average effectiveness&#13;
rating, to increase the sample size.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Having an action plan, perceiving course relevance as high, and having helpful&#13;
facilitators increase effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
5.8     The results show that a large part of the variation in perceived effectiveness can&#13;
be explained by the perceived relevance of the course material to Egypt's specific needs&#13;
(Ã=0.150, t=2.63), the development of an action plan during the course (Ã=0.535, t=2.86),&#13;
and the helpfulness of organizational (Ã=0.277, t=3.84) and country level facilitators&#13;
(Ã=0.214, t=2.60).13&#13;
&#13;
5.9     On the margin, creating an action plan increases perceived effectiveness by a little&#13;
more than half a unit, while course relevance and helpful facilitators have a smaller&#13;
marginal effect. In order to increase perceived effectiveness by one unit (say moving&#13;
from a rating of 4 to a rating of 5), almost 7 units of increase in perceived relevance (i.e. a&#13;
complete change from "Extremely Irrelevant" to "Extremely Relevant") would be&#13;
necessary. For the work environment factors, approximately a five unit increase in the&#13;
facilitator would be needed in order to experience a one unit increase in effectiveness.&#13;

     COMPARING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WBI ANDNON-WBI LEARNING&#13;
                                              ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
5.10    Of all 171 participants interviewed, only 49 (29 percent) were aware of any&#13;
learning activities with similar content offered by organizations other than WBI, in&#13;
Egypt. Of this small group, 38 respondents (22 percent of all respondents) were able to&#13;
compare the effectiveness of these non-WBI activities to similar ones offered by WBI.&#13;
&#13;
WBI and nonÂ­WBI activities are similar in perceived effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
5.11    The majority of those 38 respondents (63 percent) reported the same level of&#13;
effectiveness for similar WBI and non-WBI learning activities and 11 respondents (29&#13;
percent) thought the non-WBI activities were more effective. A minority of three&#13;
respondents only thought that the non-WBI learning activities are less effective. The&#13;
comparison to non-WBI activities is graphically illustrated in Figure 24&#13;
&#13;
5.12    Among the national institutions offering similar activities with higher level of&#13;
effectiveness are: Sadat Academy, National Institute of Transport, National Institute of&#13;
Planning, Arab Academy of Finance and Banking, Cairo and Alexandria stock exchange,&#13;
Research Commercial Studies Center, Central Bank of Egypt and the Social Fund for&#13;
Development.          These national institutions offer such learning activities either&#13;
independently or in collaboration with other international institutions such as: USAID,&#13;
Fulbright Commission, EU, UNESCO, The British Council, OUDA, Harvard Business&#13;
School and FAO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13A two-stage least squares (2SLS) model of effectiveness was originally run instrumenting for perceived&#13;
relevance. Hausman tests of the possible endogeneity in relevance indicated that there was no systematic&#13;
difference in coefficients between the exogenous model (treating relevance as exogenous) and the&#13;
instrumented 2SLS model. Based on this test we conclude that there is no evidence of endogeneity among&#13;
relevance and effectiveness and present the results from the exogenous model of effectiveness.&#13;

     6. USEFULNESS OF WBI LEARNING ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
6.1    All participants were asked whether they had developed an action plan/strategy to&#13;
apply the new ideas they learned during the activity and if so, whether they had actually&#13;
used it at work. Overall, as shown in Figure 25, 39 percent of the participants did&#13;
develop such an action plan during the activity; 28 percent of the participants actually&#13;
used part/all of the action plan at work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                                      61%        Developed action&#13;
                                                                 plan not used at work&#13;
&#13;
                            11%                                  developed action plan&#13;
                                                                 and used it at work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.2    Participants were also asked if the issues raised in WBI learning activities had&#13;
been discussed at work, with local partners, government officials or NGO's. Figure 26&#13;
shows that 40 percent of the participants discussed these issues thoroughly at work, 40&#13;
percent discussed them occasionally, and 20 percent never discussed the issues raised&#13;
during the WBI learning activities afterwards.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
6.3     The participants were asked to evaluate their usage of knowledge and skills from&#13;
the course in eight different areas:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Conducting research;&#13;
    Â· Developing country development strategies;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Implementing country development strategies;&#13;
    Â· Changing/influencing legislation;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Teaching;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Raising other's awareness in development issues;&#13;
    Â· Organizing collective community-based initiatives; and&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Implementing new practices within your work organization.&#13;
&#13;
6.4      Participants rated the level of use on a scale from 1-7 with 1 being "Use Not At&#13;
All" and 7 being "Use Very Often".                           On the average overall usage (sum of each&#13;
individuals rating in all eight areas) was rated low with a mean of 23.01 on a scale from&#13;
1-5614&#13;
&#13;
Participants identified relatively few areas for applying their newly acquired&#13;
knowledge and skills.&#13;
&#13;
6.5     Figure 27 presents the percent of participants identifying specific areas to be "Not&#13;
Applicable" for using the knowledge and skills acquired during the WBI learning&#13;
activity. Among the areas designated as "Not Applicable", almost 44 percent of the&#13;
participants identified changing/influencing legislation; these were followed by&#13;
developing country development strategies, implementing country development strategy&#13;
and organizing collective community initiatives (39 percent), and finally by conducting&#13;
research "Not Applicable" for 32 percent of participants.                                  Areas concerning raising&#13;
others' awareness in development issues and implementing new practices within the&#13;
participant's work organization are least likely to be considered "Not Applicable" in this&#13;
context.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
6.6       When the area of use of the knowledge/skills acquired in the WBI learning&#13;
activity is considered applicable to the participant's work, the majority of participants use&#13;
these knowledge/skills only occasionally as shown in Figure 28. Participants are likely to&#13;
use these knowledge/skills more often in the areas of raising others' awareness in&#13;
development issues, teaching, implementing new practices within their work&#13;
organizations and in conducting research.                                    Participants are least likely to use the&#13;
knowledge/skills           acquired                in    the       two         areas          of           changing        or influencing&#13;
legislation/regulations and implementing country development strategies, even when the&#13;
participants work in these areas.&#13;

6.7       In order to generate a smaller group of variables to describe usage we attempted&#13;
factor analysis. However, because of the large number of missing (non-applicable)&#13;
observations factor analysis was not possible.15 Instead pair wise correlations indicated&#13;
three sub-groups of usage:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15A large number of observations were rated as "Not Applicable". We recoded the non-applicable as&#13;
missing because we believe that if an area is not applicable to a person it should not be included in the&#13;
analysis. The regression analysis was thus only employed on those individuals who rated at least one&#13;
dimension of the usage areas for each of the three factors. Additionally, in creating an aggregate measure of&#13;
the variable, in each factor the ratings were summed up in order to control for wide usage (use many&#13;
dimensions) as well as high usage (use each dimension highly). Hausman tests of the possible endogeneity&#13;
in effectiveness indicated that there was no systematic difference in coefficients between the exogenous&#13;
model (treating effectiveness as exogenous) and the instrumented 2SLS model. Based on this test we&#13;
conclude that there is no evidence of endogeneity among effectiveness and usage and present the results&#13;
from the exogenous models of usage.&#13;

                                                                                                                                      31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Â· Practices and Awareness: The first factor summarizes the level of use of the new&#13;
        knowledge/skills in the areas of: raising others' awareness in development issues,&#13;
        organizing collective community initiatives, and implementing new practices in&#13;
        the work organization;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Strategies and Policies: The second factor has significantly large loadings in the&#13;
        areas of: developing country development strategies, implementing country&#13;
        development strategies, and (to a less extent) the area of changing/influencing&#13;
        legislation/regulations; and&#13;
    Â· Research and Teaching: The third factor is confined to use of the new&#13;
        knowledge/skills in teaching and conducting research.&#13;
&#13;
6.8     Participants' characteristics and features of the WBI learning activities were used&#13;
as explanatory variables for each of the three extracted factors. Also, perceived relevance&#13;
of the topics covered in the learning activity to Egypt's needs and effectiveness of the&#13;
activity are used as explanatory variables for each of the three extracted factors.&#13;
&#13;
6.9     OLS regression analysis was used to evaluate the three areas of use, controlling&#13;
for participants' demographic characteristics, course characteristics and factors in the&#13;
participant's work environment. In each area, use is measured on a continuous scale of&#13;
the summed ratings in each group for each individual.                               The results of the three&#13;
regressions on use are reported in Tables 6-8.&#13;

Overall the determinants of use are common over different areas.&#13;
&#13;
6.10    The results of the regression analysis on use show that while the determinants of&#13;
use vary by area, still some common determinants exist for all the three areas. The most&#13;
consistent determinants of usage are: being from the central government, being familiar&#13;
with the terminology of the course, developing an action plan, having helpful&#13;
organizational facilitators and perceiving the course effectiveness as high. Between 41&#13;
and 43 percent of the variation can be explained by the regressions.&#13;
&#13;
6.11    The most important determinants of the three areas of usage are:&#13;
&#13;
        Â·      Practices and Awareness:&#13;
                       - Representing the central government                        (Ã=2.193, t=2.45)&#13;
                       - Proficiency in the course terminology                      (Ã=0.768, t=2.52)&#13;
                       - Perceiving course effectiveness as high                    (Ã=1.622, t=4.16)&#13;
                       - Having helpful organizational facilitators                 (Ã=1.110, t=3.18)&#13;
        Â· Strategies and Policies:&#13;
                       - Representing the central government                        (Ã=1.874, t=1.67)&#13;
                       - High position                                              (Ã=0.915, t=2.03)&#13;
                       - Having developed an action plan                            (Ã=1.825, t=1.84)&#13;
                       - Having helpful organizational facilitators                 (Ã=1.009, t=2.55)&#13;
        Â· Research and Teaching:&#13;
                       - Working at a university/research institution               (Ã=1.559, t=1.67)&#13;
                       - Proficiency in the course terminology                      (Ã=0.470, t=1.71)&#13;
                       - Having developed an action plan                            (Ã=1.785, t=2.74)&#13;
                       - Provided with contact information                          (Ã=1.508, t=1.91)&#13;
                       - Perceiving course effectiveness as high                    (Ã=0.537, t=1.76)&#13;
&#13;
6.12    All of the above factors increase usage of the knowledge and skills acquired from&#13;
the WBI learning activities.&#13;
&#13;
6.13    Representing the central government increases use in practices and awareness and&#13;
strategies and policies by about two units (out of 21) or around 20 percent for those rating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
usage around the mean.16 Increasing proficiency in terminology by one unit (say from a 4&#13;
to a 5) increases use in practices and awareness and research and teaching by around&#13;
seven percent while increasing effectiveness by one unit increases the effect on practices&#13;
and awareness and research and teaching by 15 and seven percent.                                                          Furthermore,&#13;
increasing the rating of organizational facilitators by one unit (say from a 4 to a 5)&#13;
increases use in practices and awareness and strategies and policies by about one unit (out&#13;
of 21) or ten percent at the mean. Creating an action plan increases usage in strategies&#13;
and policies by as much as 19 percent and use in research and teaching by 25 percent.&#13;
&#13;
      FACILITATORSANDBARRIERS TO THE UTILIZATION OF LEARNING&#13;
&#13;
6.14   The participant survey examined the extent to which five factors related to the&#13;
work organization, have been helpful or unhelpful in actually using the new&#13;
knowledge/skills acquired from WBI learning activities. These factors are:&#13;
&#13;
       Â· Practices and procedures in the work organization;&#13;
       Â· Resources and funding availability in the work organization;&#13;
&#13;
       Â· Incentive system in the work organization;&#13;
       Â· Participant's supervisor; and&#13;
&#13;
       Â·   Participant's colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
Work environment factors are rated neither helpful nor unhelpful in implementing&#13;
the acquired knowledge.&#13;

6.15   As shown in Figure 29, for the majority of participants, the factors related to their&#13;
work organizations are in general considered to be neither helpful nor unhelpful in&#13;
actually using the knowledge/skills acquired from WBI learning activities. Two factors,&#13;
however, are more frequently perceived as facilitators rather than barriers: a) practices&#13;
&#13;
16The mean for usage and impact (dependent variables) are reported in Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                   35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and procedures in the work participants' work organization and b) work colleagues. Two&#13;
other factors are more frequently perceived as barriers than as facilitators a) resources&#13;
and funding and b) the incentive system. The participant's supervisor is equally likely to&#13;
be a facilitator or a barrier in this regard.&#13;
&#13;
Country level factors are neither facilitators nor barriers in using new knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
6.16    The participant survey investigated also the extent to which factors at the macro&#13;
level have been helpful or unhelpful in implementing the knowledge/skills acquired from&#13;
WBI learning activities. These macro factors are:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· The country's policies;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Social groups in the country;&#13;
    Â· Political groups in the country; and&#13;
&#13;
    Â· The country's general readiness for reform and innovation.&#13;
&#13;
6.17    As shown in Figure 30, 30 percent of respondents referred to the country's&#13;
general readiness for reform and innovation as a facilitating factor in implementing the&#13;
new knowledge acquired, while 28 percent cited the country's policies. Political groups&#13;
in the country do not seem to play any significant role in this regard and are least likely to&#13;
be seen as facilitators.         However, the fact remains that all these macro factors are&#13;
perceived by the participants as neutral in terms of facilitating or impeding the&#13;
implementation of new ideas.&#13;

 7. IMPACT OF WBI LEARNING ACTIVITIES IN EGYPT&#13;
&#13;
About one-third of the participants indicated that WBI's activities led to an overall&#13;
change.&#13;
&#13;
7.1      When asked whether the WBI learning activity had led to any overall changes in&#13;
the specific area of the activity, 30 percent of the participants responded positively, 38&#13;
percent responded negatively, and 32 percent did not know. The distribution is displayed&#13;
in Figure 31.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The impact of the WBI learning activity was rated below average.&#13;
&#13;
7.2     Of those participants who confirmed an overall change in policy following the&#13;
activities they attended, 50 percent (which translates into 15 percent of all respondents)&#13;
reported a strong positive change. Around 40 percent reported slight positive change and&#13;
10 percent thought the change was slightly negative. The survey did not examine what&#13;
the nature of the change was.&#13;
&#13;
              IMPACT ON POLICY, RESEARCH AND WORK PRACTICES&#13;
&#13;
7.3     Using a 7-point scale, the survey also investigated the impact of the WBI learning&#13;
activities in terms of negatively/positively influencing six specific areas:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Research;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Legislation or regulations;&#13;
    Â· Teaching;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                        37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Â· Consensus building for change;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Community-based initiatives; and&#13;
    Â· Work practices in the participant's organization.&#13;
&#13;
7.4     On the average overall impact (the sum of each participants rating on all six areas)&#13;
was below the midpoint with a mean of 18 on a scale from 2-39.17 A preliminary analysis&#13;
of the data revealed that the WBI activity is not applicable to each of the specific areas of&#13;
interest as depicted in Figure 32.&#13;

7.6      WBI learning activities have a strong positive influence (when applicable) on a)&#13;
research, b) teaching, c) work practices and d) consensus building for change. The&#13;
positive influence is less in the areas of legislation and community-based initiatives. The&#13;
least positive influence and the highest negative influence are both reported in the area of&#13;
legislation and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
7.7      Factor analysis could not be utilized for the purpose of reducing the different&#13;
dimensions of the perceived influence of the learning activity due to the large number of&#13;
cases that are "Not Applicable" to each individual dimension. Instead, for each individual&#13;
participant, a summed score of perceived influence pertaining to applicable dimensions&#13;
only was computed18.&#13;
&#13;
              PREDICTORS OF IMPACTOF WBI LEARNING ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
7.8      Regression analysis was employed to investigate the determinants of perceived&#13;
impact.19 The results of the OLS regression analysis on impact are presented in Table 9.20&#13;
Perceived impact ranges from 2-39.21&#13;
&#13;
Creating an action plan and having helpful country level facilitating factors increase&#13;
impact.&#13;
&#13;
7.9      The only statistically significant variables for explaining impact are the&#13;
development of an action plan and the level of helpfulness of facilitators. Development&#13;
of an action plan raised perceived impact (Ã=2.974, t=2.00), as does working in an&#13;
environment with helpful organizational and country level facilitating factors (Ã=1.822,&#13;
t=2.86 and Ã=1.095, t=1.68).&#13;
&#13;
7.10     On the margin, developing an action plan increases perceived impact by a little&#13;
less than three units on (a scale of 1 to 39) which corresponds to as much as 17 percent at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18For each participant, we summed the scores provided for applicable dimensions to account for both depth&#13;
(how intense the influence is) and breath (how many areas are influenced).&#13;
19In theory, impact is very likely to be a function of usage. When modeling impact as a function of usage&#13;
and above exogenous variables the results show that usage has a strong and significant effect on impact.&#13;
However, the effect of usage over shadows the indirect effects of all other determinants on impact so that it&#13;
seems like no other factors but frequency of usage have any significant effects on impact. Therefore, we&#13;
exclude usage from the regression analysis to get a better understanding on the direct effects of the&#13;
remaining exogenous variables on impact.&#13;
20A large number of observations were rated as "Not applicable". We recoded the non-applicable answers&#13;
as missing because we believe that if an area is not applicable to a person it should not be included in the&#13;
analysis. The regression analysis was thus only employed on those individuals who rated at least one&#13;
dimension of the imp act areas. Additionally, in creating an aggregate measure of the variable the ratings&#13;
were summed up in order to control for wide impact (impact on many dimensions) as well as high impact&#13;
(impact on each dimension highly). Hausman tests of the possible endogeneity in effectiveness indicated&#13;
that there was no systematic difference in coefficients between the exogenous model (treating effectiveness&#13;
as exogenous) and the instrumented 2SLS model. Based on this test we conclude that there is no evidence&#13;
of endogeneity among effectiveness and impact and present the results from the exogenous model of&#13;
impact.&#13;
21The possible scale ranges from 0-42 which comes from six areas each using a seven point scale.&#13;
However no one's summed impact rated below 2 or above 39.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the average; improving the work facilitators by one unit (say moving from a 4 to a 5)&#13;
increases impact by 11 percent.&#13;

                 8. LISTENING TO OUR OPERATIONAL&#13;
                                        COUNTERPARTS&#13;
&#13;
8.1      WBI's learning events are more likely to be relevant to country needs when they&#13;
are prepared in collaboration with Operations (relating better the activities to the CAS)&#13;
and in response to the needs of the country as outlined in the WBI's country program&#13;
briefs. In order to gauge WBI's link to Operations and assess its responsiveness to&#13;
country needs, six key Operational counterparts were interviewed in Washington and in&#13;
the field: three regional staff, one sector network staff and WBI regional coordinators.&#13;
Operational counterparts were asked the following questions:&#13;
&#13;
    1. To what extent are WBI learning events aligned with the CAS?&#13;
&#13;
    2. What was the extent of your involvement in WBI's activities during FY01-02?&#13;
&#13;
    3. Do you know of any outcomes that resulted from WBI's learning activities?&#13;
&#13;
    4. What are the main barriers to applying new knowledge toward change in Egypt?&#13;
&#13;
    5. Is WBI uniquely positioned to deliver learning activities for capacity building in&#13;
         Egypt?&#13;
&#13;
    6. What could have been done differently by WBI to better serve the learning needs&#13;
         of Egypt?&#13;
&#13;
    7. Taking a forward looking approach, what are some ways that WBI can assist the&#13;
         country in moving closer its development goals?&#13;
&#13;
8.2      While the answers to these questions are somewhat discouraging for FY01 and&#13;
FY02, there is a clear sense that since early FY03, WBI has started to strengthen its link&#13;
with Operations.22 Summary highlights of the interviews follow:&#13;
&#13;
Operational Staff have mixed views on WBI's Alignment with the CAS.&#13;
&#13;
8.3       Interviews with counterparts in operations yielded mixed opinions; some felt that&#13;
activities were aligned at 100 percent while another suggested that on a scale of 1 to 10,&#13;
WBI merited a 6. Still others had no idea about the extent of the alignment. WBI's&#13;
analysis of Egypt's CAS and the CRS for 2001-2002 shows that 13 of 30 (43 percent)&#13;
learning events addressed the CAS priorities (poverty reduction, environment, investment&#13;
climate and infrastructure finance).23 All interviewees confirmed that the work of WBI is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22 In the later part of FY02 WBI was represented in the Egypt field office by a senior staff member who is&#13;
50 percent WBI and 50 percent Operations. This position has started to have an active role in linking&#13;
operational lending to WBI's learning activities.&#13;
23CAS priorities cover the current CAS (June 2001) and previous CAS (May 1997).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
not yet mainstreamed in Operations and insisted that it needs to be integrated in&#13;
operations at the project level.       For this integration to happen, several interviewees&#13;
suggested involvement of WBI with Operations at the stage of project conception to&#13;
ensure that training actually becomes a component (deliverable) of each and every&#13;
Operational project.&#13;
&#13;
Operational staff at the Headquarters are disconnected from WBI.&#13;
&#13;
8.4     While Operational staff in the field seem to be taking measures to involve WBI&#13;
in the CAS process, staff at the headquarters, are far less informed about WBI and its&#13;
overall mission, strategy and activities. Interviewees at headquarters could only allude to&#13;
some "ad hoc" discussion with colleagues in WBI.&#13;
&#13;
WBI outcomes are not evident to Operational staff.&#13;
&#13;
8.5     Just one single interviewee could pin-point a specific outcome of a WBI program&#13;
in Egypt during FY01-02. Most interviewees referred generally to ad-hoc WBI events&#13;
that they had heard about in Egypt, and or to passing discussions with WBI staff.24&#13;
&#13;
Lack of incentives for change is a major barrier to use of new knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
8.6       Interviewees agreed that political resolve (particularly in the form of decision Â­&#13;
making capacity and follow-up) rather than financial resources has constrained action on&#13;
the use of new knowledge and skills.. As one interviewee put it, "Egypt has a very&#13;
conservative structure as well as a large and aging bureaucracy with few incentives for&#13;
change, all of which make the country resistant to change." Another interviewee noted&#13;
that while the government's technical knowledge is very out of date, NGOs and other&#13;
social service providers also lack basic skills in management, fund-raising, and&#13;
implementation."&#13;
&#13;
Operational staff view WBI as uniquely positioned in Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
8.7     Those interviewed in the field acknowledged that WBI is a very small contributor&#13;
to the overall national training effort in Egypt. They emphasized, however, that WBI is&#13;
unique in two respects: (a) high quality research and (b) access to and linkages with&#13;
alternative experience from around the world of what works (or does not) and why. In&#13;
addition, its training is not as highly politicized as some other, larger donors. One&#13;
interviewee in the field office indicated that WBI has created a niche for its interventions&#13;
in organizing collaboration on poverty issues; several of those interviewed indicated that&#13;
WBI needs to offer more policy services in terms of seminars and dialogues with key&#13;
decision-makers on significant CAS issues. WBI's comparative advantage according to&#13;
Operation staff at headquarters is the Institute's ability to bring the experiences from&#13;
other countries and facilitate building global linkages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24The one specific outcome of WBI's programs in Egypt was in the area of poverty reduction, where one&#13;
interviewee said that "WBI's programs on poverty have managed to break the taboo of discussing poverty&#13;
in Egypt".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
42&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
WBI has not been active enough in Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
8.8     In the past few years, WBI has not worked enough in Egypt, and the region in&#13;
general.    With the introduction of the country-focused approach and improved&#13;
communications between and WBI, this may be changing although there was a clearly&#13;
expressed concern that "WBI thematic leaders have difficulty working with the&#13;
Operational staff and MNA local partners" in part because "they view the Operational&#13;
staff as new in the knowledge business." Another interviewee indicated that WBI could&#13;
have been more pro-active in identifying the demands of the region, and integrating&#13;
training with operational projects."&#13;
&#13;
WBI needs to be more flexible and responsive to local demands.&#13;
&#13;
8.9     Operational colleagues in the field stressed that "in the future there should be&#13;
more flexibility on the side of WBI." They indicated that often when requests come from&#13;
the region, WBI has already committed its funds and does not the have the flexibility in&#13;
resources to respond to local demand. Colleagues also indicated the need for building&#13;
stronger partnerships for delivery of both face to face and e-learning activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                      9. LISTENING TO PARTICIPANTS&#13;
&#13;
9.1      Focus group meetings were held in Cairo in June 2003 to hear first hand from&#13;
participants their views about:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Relevance and usefulness of WBI activities for the Egyptians;&#13;
&#13;
    Â· Country specific barriers to use of their new knowledge and skills; and&#13;
    Â· Practical measures that WBI can take to increase impact of our programs in&#13;
         Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
9.2      Focus groups were activity specific, and selection of the activities was based on&#13;
location and the number of Egyptian participants in any given activity. Based on these&#13;
criteria, three FY01-02 activities that were both held in Cairo and had the largest number&#13;
of Egyptian participants were chosen. Three separate focus groups, each representing a&#13;
different sector - the government, private sector, and academia - were held for each of the&#13;
activities.25&#13;
&#13;
WBI activities were regarded as more useful by private sector employees than by&#13;
government employees.&#13;
&#13;
9.3      Overall, all three groups indicated that they found the courses extremely relevant&#13;
to their personal, organizational and country learning needs. As for usefulness, however,&#13;
there was a distinct difference between the discussions of the focus group that&#13;
represented government employees and that which represented the private sector.&#13;
According to government sector participants, the rigid hierarchy that exists in&#13;
government organizations in Egypt makes it extremely difficult for a participant who is&#13;
not in a decision making position to use his or her new knowledge in the work&#13;
environment. This suggests that better targeting of participants could improve WBI&#13;
activity usefulness.       Private sector participants, on the other hand, note that new&#13;
knowledge is more easily translated into action and change. Unlike the government&#13;
employees, private sector participants gave numerous examples of how new knowledge&#13;
obtained from training activities translated into specific changes in their business&#13;
conduct, resulting in major structural and budgetary changes.&#13;
&#13;
9.4      All three groups shared the same views about elements of WBI activities that&#13;
make them useful or not. Features that made WBI activities useful were their ability to:&#13;
(a) provide excellent networking opportunities, and (b) present relevant case studies and&#13;
lessons learned from other developing countries. Features that reduced usefulness were:&#13;
&#13;
25The three activities chosen for focus groups were: 1. Frontiers in Infrastructure Finance (most&#13;
participants represented the public sector); 2.Introduction to Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation (most&#13;
participants represented the academia); and 3. Innovative Marketing Communications: Promoting and&#13;
Selling Training in a Competitive Global Market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(a) tardiness in receiving the training agenda and materials which precluded preparation&#13;
for the event, (b) a "one size fit all" approach where programs were not targeted to&#13;
Egypt's specific needs, and c) lack of follow-up in a meaningful way.&#13;
&#13;
WBI should take measures to increase usefulness and impact.&#13;
&#13;
9.5     Participants suggested that task managers could increase the relevance, usefulness&#13;
and impact of the courses by taking a few practical measures:&#13;
&#13;
        a) Communicate early through non-electric means: Lack of computerization of&#13;
            the public sector translates into two immediate considerations on the part of&#13;
            our task managers a) any course documents, agendas, etc. must be sent&#13;
            several weeks in advance of the course to the ministries; and (b) any course&#13;
            follow-up must be tailored to participants depending on their access to the&#13;
            computers.&#13;
&#13;
        b) Offer courses in country: Strict budget constraints in the public sector limit&#13;
            travel for training. For this reason it is suggested that upcoming training&#13;
            targeted to government employees will be most practical if held in the&#13;
            country.&#13;
&#13;
        c) Tailor courses to country needs: Participants characterized the recent trend of&#13;
            regional offerings as a "one-size-fits-all" approach, and emphasized that this&#13;
            approach, by definition, fails to offer solutions within the constraints of&#13;
            Egypt. This especially applies to regional DL offerings, which may appear to&#13;
            be efficient but are not effective in addressing the specific needs of Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
        d) Increase the depth and breadth of training: As one participant noted, "a one-&#13;
            time training, targeting 10 Â­15 participants once every several years is simply&#13;
            not enough." In order to break through the "counter-culture of change" in&#13;
            Egypt, more courses must be conducted to a broader range of participants.&#13;
            Participants all agreed that in order to make trainings useful, the training&#13;
            should be targeted to a broad base of participants (lower level staff to senior&#13;
            management level) so as to bring the necessary awareness for changing the&#13;
            existing system; and&#13;
&#13;
        e)  Offer systematic follow-ups: Past training has had no follow-up. Participants&#13;
            agreed that their WBI training was "informative" but not enough to produce&#13;
            real changes in their existing practice at an organizational and/or even an&#13;
            individual level. To create any sort of change or impact, future WBI learning&#13;
            activities must have systematic follow-ups.&#13;
&#13;
Barriers that hinder use of new knowledge in Egypt are not country specific.&#13;
&#13;
9.6     When asked about country specific barriers to using new knowledge in Egypt,&#13;
participants listed the major barriers, but not that these barriers are not unique to Egypt&#13;
and must be considered in developing courses worldwide. The three barriers discussed&#13;
by focus group participants were:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
          a) Decision making is made only at top management level: Given the rigid&#13;
             hierarchy that exists in government organizations in Egypt, it is very difficult&#13;
             to implement the learning from the courses directed to participants from the&#13;
             public sector if they are not in a "decision-making" position.&#13;
&#13;
          b) Language is a barrier especially in global DL courses: Language barriers are&#13;
             a major impediment for making global DL offerings effective for the&#13;
             Egyptians26. Participants indicated that the use of previously taped instruction&#13;
             videos during the course were more useful than the Video Conferencing&#13;
             technology, as it was rather difficult to understand the different English&#13;
             accents over the VC especially with the communication time lag.&#13;
&#13;
          c) Knowledge sharing is a slow process in Egypt: Ministries in Egypt are not yet&#13;
             computerized. Still, paper has to move from one desk to another, which slows&#13;
             the knowledge sharing process in the work environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26This is because global DL offerings use English as the language of instruction and it becomes especially&#13;
difficult when the course is global and different accents come into play.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                        47&#13;

              10. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS&#13;
&#13;
10.1    Based on FY 01-02 data collected from participant surveys, participant focus&#13;
group discussions, interviews with Operational Staff working on Egypt (from&#13;
Washington and Cairo), and relevant operational and WBI documents, the following&#13;
conclusions and recommendations can be drawn for each of the three evaluation&#13;
questions:&#13;
&#13;
Question 1. What is the relevance of WBI learning activities to the country's needs?&#13;
&#13;
10.2    Data collected from participant surveys shows that over one-half of all&#13;
participants (57 percent) perceive the topics covered to be highly relevant while 36&#13;
percent perceive a moderate degree of relevance and only 7 percent think these topics are&#13;
irrelevant. Considering that the activities were not country focused the relevance was&#13;
very high, averaging 5.44 on a scale form 1-7. The two most significant determinants of&#13;
perceived relevance are: 1) the level of proficiency of the language of instruction, and 2)&#13;
helpful country level facilitating factors, although the effect on relevance is small for both&#13;
factors.&#13;
&#13;
10.3    During FY01-02, almost 40 percent of the participants reported a low to medium&#13;
proficiency in the language of instruction and almost 50 percent reported a low to&#13;
medium proficiency in the technical terminology used by instructors. Findings from&#13;
focus group meetings stress that lack of proficiency in the language of instruction is a&#13;
major impediment in the usefulness of the courses. This is particularly important in the&#13;
global DL offerings where the language barrier becomes even more problematic when&#13;
different accents come into play.&#13;
&#13;
10.4    The two MDGs identified as prominent were developing global partnerships for&#13;
development and improving investment climate and finance.               Examination of the&#13;
relationship between the participants' perceived relevance of the topics covered in the&#13;
learning activity and whether the activity was related to each of the millennium goals&#13;
reveals no significant relationship.&#13;
&#13;
10.5    It is important that task managers ensure the proficiency of participants in the&#13;
language of instruction and in the terminology.          Proficiency of participants in the&#13;
language of instruction and in the terminology should indeed be considered as a pre-&#13;
condition for relevance.      Selecting participants who are already proficient in the&#13;
terminology used in the learning activities, providing translations, and devoting sufficient&#13;
time at the beginning of the activity to ensure clarity of this terminology is imperative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10.6    Even though, none of the activities were designed as especially focused on&#13;
Egypt's needs the WBI activities for Egyptians were somewhat country focused in nature&#13;
both on the activity level and as perceived by participants.&#13;
&#13;
Question 2. What is the effectiveness and impact of WBI learning activities?&#13;
&#13;
10.7    Overall effectiveness is found to be slightly above average. Participants found&#13;
WBI activities to be mostly effective in the areas of raising awareness/understanding of&#13;
development issues, refining the knowledge the participants already had, providing new&#13;
information and encouraging networking. They found such activities to be least effective&#13;
in areas concerning providing strategies/approaches to address the needs of their&#13;
organizations or to address the development needs of the country.&#13;
&#13;
10.8    As for implementing their new knowledge and skills, most participants use them&#13;
occasionally. Participants are most likely to use their knowledge/skills to raise others'&#13;
awareness of development issues, teach, implement new practices within their work&#13;
organizations and conduct research.           Participants are least likely to use the&#13;
knowledge/skills acquired to change or influence legislation/regulations and to&#13;
implement country development strategies, even when the participants work in these&#13;
areas. It is not surprising, therefore, that impact of WBI learning activities in Egypt is&#13;
least in the area of legislation and regulation and strongest in the areas of research,&#13;
teaching, work practices and consensus building.&#13;
&#13;
10.9    For the majority of participants, factors related to their work organizations and to&#13;
their country are considered to be neither helpful or unhelpful in actually using the&#13;
knowledge/skills acquired from WBI learning activities. The study notes, however, that&#13;
factors such as local work practices, colleagues, supervisors, and the country's general&#13;
readiness for reform are factors that facilitate implementation of new knowledge.&#13;
Barriers to using new knowledge and skills are two-fold: resources/funding availability&#13;
and incentive systems in the work organizations.&#13;
&#13;
10.10 Three features of WBI's learning activities are significant in explaining&#13;
effectiveness: a) perceived relevance, b) development of an action plan during the&#13;
activity, and c) facilitating factors in the work environment. County focused activities, at&#13;
least when it comes to the participants' perception of the relevance of the activity they&#13;
attended to Egypt's needs, is thus important to increase perceived effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
Question 3. What is the contribution of WBI learning programs/activities to building&#13;
in-country capacity? And how does this contribution compare with others delivered by&#13;
other members of the development community?&#13;
&#13;
10.11 During FY01 and 02, WBI did not invest significantly in sustained capacity&#13;
building in Egypt, with the result that even low-cost-follow-up (e.g. newsletters)&#13;
necessary for sustained capacity building was far from optimum:&#13;
&#13;
    Â· No follow-up contacts occurred for 60 percent of the learning activities. Where&#13;
        follow-up contacts, these were infrequent and mainly by e-mail. During focus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         groups meetings, participants voiced their concern about the lack of follow-up and&#13;
         their disappointment in learning that their training was "a one shot deal"; and&#13;
&#13;
    Â· The participants did not receive any newsletters related to the learning activity in&#13;
         78 percent of the cases. Among the one-fifth that received a newsletter, the&#13;
         overall evaluation of it was "moderately useful".&#13;
&#13;
10.12 Overall usage of the acquired knowledge and skills from the training was low&#13;
essentially linked to those participants representing the central government, proficient in&#13;
the terminology used in the instruction, perceiving effectiveness as high, formulating an&#13;
action plan, and having helpful organizational facilitators for implementing the&#13;
knowledge. Having some or all of these present significantly raised usage of the material.&#13;
The impact of WBI activities in terms of stimulating influence and change was below&#13;
average as well. Impact tended to increase where an action plan was developed during&#13;
the activity and where facilitating factors were present in the work environment to&#13;
implement the new knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
10.13 The fact that WBI activities were not country specific, is not a surprising finding,&#13;
given that WBI did not seek to design its activities with a country focus and on the basis&#13;
of CASs.        WBI's decision to adopt a country-focused approach is welcomed by&#13;
participants who at face-to-face meetings made it clear that "courses that come with an&#13;
agenda that `one size-fits-all' will not work; we need training that addresses Egypt's&#13;
problems and offers solutions that are within the constraints of our country."               27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.14 WBI is a very small contributor to the overall national training effort in Egypt.&#13;
There are several reputable national institutions offering similar activities either&#13;
independently or in collaboration with other international organizations. Comparing the&#13;
effectiveness of WBI to non-WBI offerings, over 60 percent of respondents reported that&#13;
non-WBI activities are just as effective as WBI's, and almost one-third thought that the&#13;
non-WBI activities were actually more effective.28 Both participants and counterparts in&#13;
operations agree, however, that WBI is unique in providing access to (and linkages with)&#13;
alternative experience from around the world. In addition, it is widely believed that&#13;
WBI's training in Egypt is not as highly politicized as some other larger international&#13;
institutions. Among all other players in Egypt, WBI seems to have created a niche for its&#13;
interventions in organizing collaboration on poverty issues.&#13;
&#13;
10.15 To make a difference, WBI's presence in Egypt should become much more&#13;
country-specific and systematic: learning activities must be designed with the country's&#13;
needs and constraints in mind, and the Institute should establish an institutionally agreed&#13;
upon approach to systematically follow up on its learning activities. It is only through&#13;
such approach that WBI can successfully establish and then sustain local trainees that can&#13;
be drivers of institutional impact in Egypt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27It should be noted that despite these concerns voiced by participants in face-to-face meetings, data&#13;
analysis of participant surveys does not draw any relationship between outcome imp act variables and&#13;
whether the WBI learning activity was designed specially for Egypt or not.&#13;
28This finding should be used with caution because only 38 respondents were willing or able to compare&#13;
the effectiveness of WBI with non-WBI activities.&#13;

The questionnaire has four sections and should take between 20 to 30 minutes to&#13;
complete.&#13;
&#13;
Â·   Section 1 asks your opinion about the usefulness of the learning activity&#13;
&#13;
Â·   Section 2 asks about the relevance of the learning activity to the specific needs&#13;
    of your country&#13;
&#13;
Â·   Section 3 asks you to compare WBI learning activities with similar ones offered&#13;
    by other organizations&#13;
&#13;
Â·   Section 4 asks about the characteristics of the learning event and your&#13;
    background.&#13;

            The impact of WBI client activities,
            FY01-02, on participants from Egypt : a baseline assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Traditionally, WBI's approach to
            capacity enhancement emphasized thematic (or sectoral) and
            knowledge (or learning) objectives. Over the past year,
            however, in response to the challenges of achieving the
            Millennium Development Goals and in support of the World
            Bank's corporate aims, WBI modified its strategy and
            structure by adding a country pillar to the previous
            thematic and knowledge/learning pillars. As part of
            WBI's new direction, the World Bank Institute
            Evaluation Group (IEG) initiated a retrospective study of
            FY01-02 programs for participants from Brazil, Thailand,
            Egypt, Russia and Sri Lanka. This study reports the findings
            from this study which will serve as a baseline for assessing
            the impact of future country focus programs for Egypt.  This
            country-focused evaluation of WBI's learning activities
            in Egypt during FY01-02 sought answers to three questions:
            What is the relevance of WBI learning activities to
            Egypt's needs?  What is the effectiveness and impact of
            WBI learning activities in Egypt?  What is the contribution
            of WBI learning programs/activities to building in country
            capacity in Egypt? And how does this contribution compare
            with others delivered by other members of the development community?
