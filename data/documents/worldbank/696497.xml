LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                 Republic of Indonesia&#13;
Implementing Agency:      Directorate-General of Primary and Secondary Education,&#13;
Ministry of Education and Culture&#13;
Beneficiaries:            Approximately 580,000 school children and out-of-school youth in the&#13;
provinces of East Java and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), with emphasis&#13;
on girls and rural communities.&#13;
Poverty:                  Program of Targeted Intervention. The project would target&#13;
student scholarships, new and alternative schools, and over 60&#13;
percent of quality intervention to poor rural areas.&#13;
Amount:                   US$99 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:                    Repayable in 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the&#13;
Bank's standard variable interest rate for currency pool loans.&#13;
Commitment Fee:           0.75 percent on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less any waiver.&#13;
Financing Plan:           See Table 4.3 under para. 4.7.&#13;
Economic Rate             The economic rate of return for the project investment ranges from&#13;

GLOSSARY&#13;
Completion Rate                The ratio between the number of students completing an&#13;
education cycle or level in a given year (T) as compared to&#13;
the number of students who entered the initial grade of that&#13;
cycle or level as many years earlier as those required to its&#13;
regular completion (i.e., T-3 for junior secondary education&#13;
in Indonesia).&#13;
Dropout Rate                   Percentage of students who abandon the system without&#13;
completing an education cycle, level or grade (e.g., primary&#13;
education, junior secondary education).&#13;
Educational Attainment         Number of formal school years achieved by a student.&#13;
Educational Achievement        Magnitude achievement (scores) in any subject area,&#13;
generally measured on the basis of national curriculum&#13;
learning objectives.&#13;
Gross Enrollment Rate (GER)    Percentage of all children attending a cycle or grade of&#13;
schooling as compared to the respective age group&#13;
population. GER is expected to be higher than NER.&#13;
Net Enrollment Rate (NER)      Percentage of children of a given age group (e.g., 13-15 for&#13;
junior secondary education in Indonesia) enrolled in their&#13;
corresponding cycle or grade, as compared to the respective&#13;
age group population. NER is expected to be lower than&#13;
GER.&#13;
Promotion Rate                 Percentage of the students enrolled in a given grade who&#13;
proceed to enroll in the next higher grade the following&#13;
academic year.&#13;
Repetition Rate                Percentage of students enrolled in a certain grade who are&#13;
not promoted to the next grade and who therefore enroll&#13;
again in the same grade the following year.&#13;
Retention Rate                 Percentage of students who have stayed at school during a&#13;
given cycle, level or grade, as opposed to dropout rate&#13;
(those who left the system).&#13;
Transition Rate                Percentage of students completing one school cycle (e.g.,&#13;
primary) who enroll in the first grade of the next upper cycle&#13;
or level (e.g., junior secondary) the following year.&#13;

1. JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION ISSUES IN EAST JAVA AND EAST&#13;
NUSA TENGGARA (NTT)&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Over the past 25 years, the CGovemment of Indonesia (GOI) has demonstrated a strong&#13;
commitment to education and as a result, the country has achieved one of the best rates of&#13;
primary education enrollment in the developing world. The Govemment led an enrollment&#13;
drive and massive school building program in the 1970s (SD INPRES), sharply increasing&#13;
primary school services throughout its dispersed territory. The gross enrollment rates stood at&#13;
75 percent in the early 1970s and went up to about 90 percent by the end of that decade. By&#13;
the mid-1980s, gross enrollment rates exceeded 100 percent and by 1994/95 had reached 112&#13;
percent. The effort is not complete because of quality concems and the need to increase&#13;
retention rates, but the achievements at this level have been remarkable. Annexes 1, 3 and 4&#13;
provide basic data on the educational structure and administration in Indonesia (see also para.&#13;
1.12).&#13;
1.2   The Government is now looking to future development needs, and has reiterated its&#13;
determination to pursue a proactive program of junior secondary education as part of the newly&#13;
designed nine--year basic education system. Therefore, while maintaining its concem with&#13;
quality primary education for all, the Government aims at universal basic education (grades 1-&#13;
9) by 2008-9, as an imperative way to meet the human resource requirements for transforming&#13;
the economy from one based on natural resources to one relying more on industry and&#13;
technology.&#13;
1.3   The decision to expand junior secondary education participation in Indonesia as rapidly&#13;
as feasible is justified for several reasons (see Annex I for detailed background). First,&#13;
expansion appears to be a precondition for the rapid growth of the economy in the medium&#13;
term, and particularly so in a rapidly modernizing province such as East Java (see paras. 1.26-&#13;
1.30). Recent research on the development of East Asian economies indicates that with the&#13;
achievement of near universal primary education, expanding enrollments at the secondary&#13;
(junior and senior) level had a strong impact on economic growth. Secondary education plays&#13;
the role of providing more educated entrants to the labor force, enhancing workers' trainability,&#13;
and providing qualified inputs into higher levels of education. In this regard, the Indonesian&#13;
economy and labor market is in the midst of a structural transformation. Since 1990, there has&#13;
been a marked slow-down in employment creation in agriculture and an acceleration in the rate&#13;
of growth of job creation in manufacturing, construction, transport and communication, and&#13;
services in general. After a period of wage stagnation in the 1980s, there are strong indications&#13;
of rising real wage rates throughout the country and a marked decline of employment in&#13;
agriculture. If sustained nationally for a decade or so, these trends imply the absorption of&#13;
remaining pockets of surplus labor, and as happened in other NICs, the transformation of an&#13;
agrarian economy into one relying on the education and productivity of its workers. Social rates&#13;
of return to education computed from 1986-92 indicate that retums to junior secondary&#13;
education are the highest among the education subsectors. East Java, on a faster and more&#13;
advanced economic path, is already reaching this turning point, whereas other regions such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2               East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
East Nusa Tenggara (NTT') are not expected to reach it before the end of the decade (see&#13;
paras. 1.39-1.41).&#13;
1.4    The second justification for significant Government attention to junior secondary&#13;
education is that the number of JSE school places is still limited relative to demand, despite&#13;
substantial outlays by parents and a significant private sector response (see Annex 1, Sections I&#13;
and II). This shortage is highlighted by several factors: the continued strong demand for&#13;
generally more costly and often lower quality private junior secondary schools, large numbers&#13;
of unsuccessful applicants to schools, the frequency of double shifts and large classes, and the&#13;
use of school library and laboratory space for routine classroom teaching.&#13;
1.5    A third rationale for Government intervention is to assist in removing barriers of cost&#13;
and isolation that keep many of the rural poor out of school, as is the case mainly in NTT. The&#13;
total cost to families of educating a child in junior secondary school accounts for 80 percent of&#13;
per capita household expenditure of the lowest income quintile. Junior secondary education is&#13;
therefore beyond the reach of many of the poor and near poor. The opportunity costs of&#13;
keeping children in school further exacerbate the problem (see Annex 1, Section 1).&#13;
1.6    A  fourth rationale relates to likely externalities associated with investments in&#13;
secondary education. Research from comparable countries has pointed to externalities such as&#13;
reduced fertility and child mortality and improved nutritional status that correlate with female&#13;
secondary education (see box on p. 8). For Indonesia, survey results indicate that a mother's&#13;
education is an important determinant of prenatal care utilization: 25 percent of women with&#13;
some primary education do not use prenatal care compared to less than 10 percent of women&#13;
with junior secondary education. Furthermore, analysis of nutritional status in Indonesia finds a&#13;
strong effect of maternal education on children's nutritional status: for women with between&#13;
zero and five years of education, an additional year of education has no impact on the child's&#13;
nutritional status, while, among women with six to twelve (or more) years of education, an&#13;
additional year of schooling improves nutritional status significantly.&#13;
1.7   The role of the Govemment would therefore be to: (a) help expand the number of&#13;
school places through a combination of direct investment and measures to stimulate further&#13;
private sector/community participation in the provision of school places; (b) improve the&#13;
teaching-learning quality of the existing and new junior secondary schools; and (c) ensure that&#13;
the poor are given increased opportunity to participate in the expansion process of quality&#13;
education at the junior secondary level.&#13;
1.8    Sector Financing Plan. Achieving universal nine years of education will require&#13;
significant additional public resources to be channeled into the education sector overall and into&#13;
basic education, in particular. Estimates of the total costs of the junior secondary expansion&#13;
program come to approximately $7.6 billion to be phased out over a ten-year period (see&#13;
Annex I for details). The cost estimates assume that the private sector will at least maintain its&#13;
high current share of about 40 percent of total enrollment. Additional financing of an average&#13;
$120 million during the next ten years of expansion (assuming 6 percent per annum growth of&#13;
' The Indonesian name for East Nusa Tenggara is Nusa Tenggara Timur, or NTT, and thus, for the sake&#13;
of simplicity and comprehension, NTT is the acronym used in this document.&#13;

the budget) would be required, implying that the budgetary allocation to junior secondary&#13;
education would need to increase from the current 13 percent to approximately 16 percent of&#13;
the education budget in the next few years. Overall, Indonesia would need to increase its&#13;
allocation to education as a proportion of GDP by approximately 0.2 percent. This does not&#13;
take into account, however, increases in other education subsectors, which may equally be&#13;
required.&#13;
1.9   In order to finance the expansion, the Government has both increased its education&#13;
investments and requested help from donors to close the financing gap. In its most recent&#13;
budget allocations (1996/97) the education sector budget was increased by 20 percent, one of&#13;
the highest increases of all GOI sectors. The corresponding budget for junior secondary&#13;
education saw a 24 percent rise over last year's budget allocation (see paras. 6.4-6.6).&#13;
1.10   Consistent with the important role it has played in basic education development, the&#13;
Government is increasing its education investments and requesting help from donors (see para.&#13;
2.1). These efforts include a proposed program of up to eight junior secondary education&#13;
projects for which World Bank assistance would be sought over the next four to five fiscal&#13;
years. The present project, which encompasses the two provinces of East Java and Nusa Tenggara&#13;
Timur (see Table 1.1 and Annex 2 for provincial profile), or about 1/5 of Indonesia's total&#13;
population, is one of an initial series of three projects (the other two being the Central Indonesia&#13;
project, which covers the provinces of Central Java, Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan and&#13;
Yogyakarta, and the Sumatra Project, which covers the provinces of Aceh, West Sumatra, Jambi,&#13;
Lampung and South Sumatra). The 1995 Book and Reading Development Project (Ln. 3887-&#13;
IND) and the 1996 Secondary School Teacher Development Project (Ln. 3979-lND) will&#13;
complement these efforts, as well as other planned basic education operations in other clusters&#13;
of provinces. To promote efficiency and equity in the use of resources, the Government has&#13;
recognized that educational development among and within the provinces must be balanced&#13;
and appropriate to local conditions; meeting an acceptable standard of quality; and taking&#13;
advantage of lessons learned within and outside the country.&#13;

1.11   Although the Government can and should promote expansion at the junior secondary&#13;
level, it is also aware that Indonesia will not be able to reach universal basic education&#13;
enrollment until graduation rates improve at the primary level. Despite high gross enrollment&#13;
rates at the primary level overall, about 25 percent of pupils, especially in the more difficult&#13;
remote areas, do not complete the full six years of education. Universal nine-year education&#13;
thus depends on improving the efficiency of the primary system and producing an expanded&#13;
pool of candidates for junior secondary school. The Government has started addressing this&#13;
issue through a series of initiatives, including the Primary Education Quality Improvement&#13;
Project (Ln. 3448-IND) which is piloting measures for improving education quality. Satisfying&#13;
existing unmet demand, even at current primary-to-junior-secondary transition rates during the&#13;
project period, is seen as an important objective. This will help satisfy communities that are&#13;
lukewarm to primary education because of lack of opportunities for secondary education. The&#13;
combined effects of these measures would be to improve the transition rates and the potential&#13;
for accelerating the development of junior secondary education in the future.&#13;
1.12   Structure of the Education System. The education system in Indonesia (see Annex&#13;
3) consists of a six-year primary school cycle, junior and senior secondary school cycles of&#13;
three years each, and a post-secondary system ranging from one to six years. Primary education&#13;
is largely the domain of Government: nearly five out of six pupils are enrolled in public&#13;
schools. Private schooling plays a much greater role in secondary education. Private schools&#13;
account for 41 percent of enrollment in junior secondary education and 54 percent in senior&#13;
secondary. Junior secondary education is provided through 8,712 public (46 percent) and&#13;
10,279 private (54 percent) general junior secondary schools (the Sekolah Menengah Pertama,&#13;
or SMP) and a remaining 300 vocational schools that emphasize either technical or home&#13;
economics subjects, all of which are administered by the Ministry of Education and Culture&#13;
(MOEC). The Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) administers the 582 public and 7,547&#13;
private Muslim (Madrasah Tsanawiyah, or MTs) junior secondary schools. At the senior&#13;
secondary level, 3,241 public and 10,380 private schools enroll a total of 4.2 million students,&#13;
for a gross enrollment rate of 34 percent (see Annex 4 for a summary of number of students&#13;
and teachers by type of school).&#13;

1.13   Challenges in the provision of junior secondary education are common to all provinces&#13;
in Indonesia, though not to the same extent. These challenges are to (a) expand equitable&#13;
access to junior secondary education; (b) improve the quality of education throughout the&#13;
provinces; and (c) make education management more efficient as the provinces assume&#13;
increased responsibility. East Java and NTT each face these challenges under specific&#13;
educational constraints.  Access is restricted mainly by the lack of places; high direct,&#13;
transportation, and opportunity costs; and, in NTr particularly, great distances and lirnited&#13;
transportation networks (see paras. 1.31-1.34 for East Java, and 1.42-1.44 for NTT). In&#13;
response, the project would help East Java to reach 75 percent of the 13-15 age-group&#13;
coverage (up from the current 55 percent), and NTT to reach 60 percent (up from the present&#13;
39 percent) by the year 2001 (see Table 1.2). The most important factors affecting quality and&#13;
internal efficiency are: teacher skills and deployment; the availability of library and&#13;
supplementary books, teaching materials, science education equipment and methodology,&#13;
pedagogical supervision; educational assessment system and school management; the role of&#13;
private education; and the education of women.&#13;
1.14   Teachers. Although there is an excess number of teachers available in aggregate, a&#13;
distribution problem exists nevertheless between provinces and, within the same province,&#13;
between rural and urban areas. Some provinces like East Java have a large pool of teacher&#13;
candidates (in 1994-95 48,000 candidates took the general exam organized to select 2,000&#13;
teachers). Others like NTT rely on teachers from other regions to cover a deficit in locally-bom&#13;
teachers. Also, urban centers have a surplus of Pancasila teachers, but rural areas (and more&#13;
particularly in remote regions) face a chronic shortage of teachers for core subjects such as&#13;
Bahasa Indonesia, Mathematics, Science and English. This is because most rural teaching&#13;
positions are considered undesirable by urban teachers (where the majority of the current stock&#13;
is from), and soon after being appointed to rural areas, many manage to be replaced into urban&#13;
schools or find excuses to be absent for long periods. To remedy the shortage of teachers in&#13;
rural and remote areas, the project would support, on a pilot basis, the hiring of "contract&#13;
teachers" in rural schools in key academic areas (see paras. 3.25, 3.45). It would also provide&#13;
teacher dormitories (see paras. 3.19 and 3.39). In addition, the Govemment is already&#13;
providing some financial compensation for hardship. Over the longer term, the solution planned&#13;
to keeping teachers in rural areas is local recruitment and training (see Annex 5).&#13;
1.15   The unequal distribution of teachers has different consequences in the urban areas&#13;
where many teachers are underutilized, and high levels of absenteeism are observed. Teachers&#13;
generally spend only a limited time in school because of the very few hours they are assigned to&#13;
teach. This is compounded by the lack of teacher rooms in many schools, and the absence of&#13;
an environment which promotes interaction among teachers. The school principal is usually&#13;
assisted by four deputies only one of whom is responsible for pedagogical supervision.&#13;
Management is therefore focused on purely administrative issues rather than the educational&#13;
process. And the opportunity to promote improved teaching in the various subjects is lost.&#13;
Teachers recognize this gap and have organized subject matter discussion and leamning groups&#13;
(MGMP) as a part of their association effort to foster cooperation and feedback.&#13;
1.16   The de-centralization of the PKG and MGMP system (see Annex 5) to the district level&#13;
and the systematic involvement of regional MOEC staff, including supervisors and principals&#13;
in the training program (both supported by the proposed project, see paras. 3.24 and 3.44)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6               East Java and N17 Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
would help address this issue. Establishment of subject matter groups would be encouraged in&#13;
schools, similar to those run by the teacher associations. These groups would gradually be&#13;
institutionalized as subject departments in the larger schools. Within these departments&#13;
teachers would take collective responsibility for student achievement in a given subject area&#13;
and provide systematic support for new and less experienced teachers.&#13;
1.17   Providing incentives to teachers to spend more time on teaching and reduce&#13;
absenteeism also needs to be considered. The costs of this can be high, however, as a general&#13;
salary increase for all educational staff would have large fiscal implications on the overall civil&#13;
service wage bill. Hence, specific teaching hour supplements that are phased in and linked to&#13;
performance may be introduced if an efficient management system for this can be developed.&#13;
1.18   Teacher training would be provided (see paras. 3.24 and 3.44) in the context of the&#13;
existing PKG system (see Annex 5), which would be revised so as to (a) revitalize program&#13;
activities, which have tended to become routinized through frequent repetition, and (b) give&#13;
more attention to student learning issues, since despite the efforts of previous training projects&#13;
teachers have operated as a one-way system without carefully checking what students learn and&#13;
how they learn in classroom activities. The revised PKG Model C program would include a&#13;
consideration of the special problems affecting schools in remote areas.&#13;
1.19   Student Performance Assessment. Recent teacher evaluation study (including East&#13;
Java) found that teachers very often behave within a supply-side strategy or a one-way&#13;
approach; they do not seem to be concerned whether their students are learning or not. The&#13;
student performance assessment system would give teachers a tool to assess their classes and&#13;
their students individually, and would thus help them adjust their own classroom teaching&#13;
plans, strategies and methods. This would also help school principals evaluate what and how&#13;
students are learning, their teachers' skills and agree with them on adequate remedial training&#13;
courses. Also, it would provide Kanwils and Kandeps with a general evaluation of student&#13;
achievements and specific school needs, while giving the provincial and central administration&#13;
essential information on the education system (see paras. 3.26, 3.46).&#13;
1.20   Library and Supplementary Books. Fifty-eight percent of East Java JSE schools&#13;
and 79 percent of NTT do not have a school library, and many of the existing school libraries&#13;
range from poor to practically non-functional. Indeed, many books available are not being&#13;
used, either because they do not interest the young readers, have little relationship with&#13;
classroom activities, or even are in a foreign language. In addition, current school library&#13;
facilities and restrictions do not encourage students' attendance, and the librarians lack the&#13;
skills and the status to 'bell" the available information to the potential users. In order to help&#13;
provide schools with a more diversified source of information, principals and teacher-librarians&#13;
will be given the opportunity to select library (reading, supplementary and reference) books&#13;
most suitable to their students needs, culture and preferences (see paras. 3.27-28, 3.47-48).&#13;
1.21   Science and Technology Education. The following problems currently exist: (a)&#13;
science scores are among the lowest in the five key subject matters of the JSE curriculum; (b)&#13;
science teachers are those most frequently absent in rural schools; (c) laboratory equipment is&#13;
not used by teachers, who instead adopt blackboard writing as a substitute for experiment and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                              7&#13;
hands-on methodology; (d) the technology component of the mandated 'Science and&#13;
Technology Education" curriculum has never been adequately integrated in the programs and&#13;
textbooks; and (e) a methodological approach has never been defined for JSE science&#13;
education as an introductory phase (see Annex 6 and paras. 3.30, 3.50).&#13;
1.22   Management. In addition to access and quality, East Java and NTT face new and&#13;
existing management issues as a result of the deconcentration of tasks from the center to the&#13;
provinces, a process this project will support. For historical and political reasons, public&#13;
administration in Indonesia has been highly centralized and decision making is tightly&#13;
controlled by central Govemment in Jakarta. The center has traditionally set objectives for&#13;
education expansion and development, with few inputs from the provinces. However, the&#13;
differences of local conditions in each province and district, accentuated by the great distances&#13;
of the outer islands from the administrative centre, make it increasingly difficult for central&#13;
administration to devise and implement satisfactory solutions to local problems. Although&#13;
central MOEC needs to retain a significant role in providing policy guidelines and promoting&#13;
regional equity and overall economic development, the Government has decided gradually to&#13;
devolve authority to the provinces and districts. As a result several functions of the Ministry of&#13;
Education and Culture are being entrusted to provincial (Kanwil) and district (Kandep/Kanim)&#13;
education offices (see paras 3.32-34, 3.52-54).&#13;
1.23   The institutional analysis of JSE's administrative system has indicated that: (i) at the&#13;
central level, there is growing understanding (increasingly translated into operational terms)&#13;
that the deconcentration of functions does not imply a less significant role for central units, but&#13;
rather a shift towards a more policy-oriented, monitoring, technically assisting and evaluating&#13;
role; (ii) at the provincial and district levels, Kanwil and Kandep/Kanin offices still lack the&#13;
managerial and analytical tools required for planning, policy and financial analysis, project&#13;
implementation and evaluation; and (iii) at the school level, principals need to improve their&#13;
ability to enhance their teachers' motivation and productivity, and learn how to better link the&#13;
schools with their catchment communities (see Annex 7). In addition, the management of&#13;
information in the administrative system requires strong streamlining. Three times a year the&#13;
administration collects from the schools large quantities of data which go up the system (from&#13;
sub-districts to the central MOEC), but are rarely analyzed and transformed into information to&#13;
be used for decision-making and provided as feedback to the schools (see paras. 3.35, 3.55).&#13;
1.24   Private Schools. Over the past ten years, private junior secondary school enrollments&#13;
have consistently been above 40 percent (see Annexes 1 and 8). The main reason for the&#13;
proliferation of private schools is the insufficient supply from the public sector, either because no&#13;
public school is available in the area, or because the existing public schools cannot meet the whole&#13;
demand. And since admission into public junior secondary schools is largely determined by the&#13;
applicants scholastic aptitude, private schools generally cater to the students with lower academic&#13;
scores. Private schools are established and operated mainly by (a) local communities which have&#13;
not succeeded in their efforts to have a public school established, (b) associations of teachers, and&#13;
(c) local religious groups.&#13;
1.25   Private schools, while costing more to parents than public schools, deliver the program at a&#13;
lower unit cost than public schools, primarily because of lower teacher salaries. Especially, in&#13;
small, poor communities, schools established by religious groups or by the community provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8East Java and NTTJtinior Secondary Education Project&#13;
both for students' access to schooling and for job opportunities for local teachers. Because of&#13;
their lower status and opportunities, most schools are of low quality, and examination scores&#13;
are routinely below those for public schools. Nevertheless, private J'unior secondary schools&#13;
Will continue to be a relevant partner in the overall expansion and quality-driven effort. The&#13;
cost implications of three altemative public/private scenarios over the next 15 years are&#13;
analyzed in Annex 1, section E.&#13;

C. EAST JAVA&#13;
1.26.  Socio-economic Framework. East Java, with 32 million inhabitants, stands today at&#13;
the forefront of modem Indonesia, its economy spurred by rising industrialization and&#13;
modemizing agriculture, a blend not unlike that which occurred in Korea during the 1960s.&#13;
Starting from a low level, East Java has been growing steadily in the past decade, above the&#13;
national growth rates. Between 1984-1995, per capita GDP grew at about 5.5 percent,&#13;
compared to the national average of 4.8 percent, placing the province in the 'high growth, low&#13;
income" quadrant. Urbanization has been spreading, with about 32 percent of the population&#13;
living in urban areas in 1995, as compared to only 20 percent a decade earlier. Surabaya, the&#13;
province capital and the second largest city in the country, has become the leading economic&#13;
pole around which the Eastem half of Indonesia gravitates.&#13;
1.27   East Java boasts the second largest industrial base of the country in terms of&#13;
employment and establishments, and contributes about 22 percent of the national value added&#13;
by manufacturing. It also produces the highest non-oil GDP among all provinces. It has a&#13;
balanced distribution of economic activities, a distinguishing factor relative to other provinces.&#13;
It is the only province which has achieved impressive growth rates and relatively higher per&#13;
capita incomes without the advantage of substantial natural resources (oil, timber) or special&#13;
stimuli like tourist dollars or a massive influx of extemal capital.&#13;
1.28   The regional economy experienced a structural shift during the 1970s and 1980s: the&#13;
share of agriculture in the economy declined from 50 percent in 1970 to less than 25 percent in&#13;
1987, and agriculture's share of employment went down from 56 percent in 1987 to 43 percent&#13;
in 1994. The industrial sector increased from 14 to 25 percent, with the central core region&#13;
becoming a center of manufacturing industry growth. Services also grew from 36 to 50&#13;
percent. While all sectors grew between 1983 and 1987, the largest growth rate was in&#13;
manufacturing (7 percent) and services (6 percent). All these changes are expected to continue&#13;
as East Java is becoming the focal point of the transition of Indonesia's economy in the next&#13;
decade.&#13;
1.29   Given the ongoing structural transformation of its economy, and its expected further&#13;
development, East Java will require an increasingly educated labor force, among other factors.&#13;
The labor market in East Java is already recruiting senior secondary school graduates even in&#13;
semi-skilled assembly jobs in manufacturing and clerical jobs in the service sector, virtually&#13;
closing the door to the recruitment of primary school graduates for all but the most basic or&#13;
menial jobs in the modem sector and in agriculture. The wage premium for senior secondary&#13;
graduates is an additional 60 percent over junior secondary graduates, indicating that the&#13;
benefits of junior secondary education are in a way linked to the prospects of continuing to the&#13;
senior secondary level.&#13;
1.30   This overall picture of East Java prosperity, however, contrasts sharply with the high&#13;
levels of poverty still characteristic of some areas of the province -- 16 out of 37 districts have&#13;
more than 25 percent of their villages targeted by the IDT program, a 1994 Presidential&#13;
initiative providing special assistance to the poorest communities of the country (see Annex&#13;
14). The illiteracy rate for people 10-year old and above is 23 percent in East Java, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10              East Java and NIT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
compared to 16 percent nationwide. East Java urbanization figures (30 percent) are heavily&#13;
biased by eight major urban areas, as half of the 37 districts do not exceed a 19 percent&#13;
urbanization rate. If the poor and near-poor are not equipped today with higher levels of&#13;
education beyond primary, they will not be able to compete for future jobs and will be a drag&#13;
on average productivity (including agriculture productivity) in the long run.&#13;
1.31   Specific JSE Issues. Junior secondary education both as the expansion of basic&#13;
schooling for the population and the necessary condition to a senior secondary education&#13;
diploma addresses the two mentioned East Java issues, the formation of a higher-level labor&#13;
force in an equitable fashion. Some problems still hamper the achievement of these goals such&#13;
as still low (albeit increasing) JSE enrollments and low quality levels of schooling. These&#13;
problems can be analyzed in the context of poverty, economic asymmetries among province&#13;
districts, and between rural and urban populations.&#13;
1.32   A combination of factors explains the low transition rate from primary to junior&#13;
secondary education: i) high, and increasing, direct costs of education which for the poor and&#13;
near-poor (who are the groups currently not enrolled) are prohibitive; ii) high indirect costs&#13;
from the point of view of wages foregone during schooling and time spent by rural children in&#13;
traveling to far-away schools; iii) unavailability of schools in rural areas; and iv) the inability of&#13;
poor families to finance the costs (since the possibilities of borrowing for education are&#13;
practically non-existent).&#13;
1.33   The economic heterogeneity of the province translates into uneven enrollment levels&#13;
across the 37 districts. Eight districts have GER under 40 percent, with one -Sampang- as low&#13;
as 16 percent (see Annex 14). In contrast, urban areas fare rather well, with 9 districts&#13;
boasting GER above 85 percent, and 4 urban districts above 110 percent. The poor in rural&#13;
areas live on average much further away from school: children from the bottom income quintile&#13;
live at a distance 47 percent greater than children from the top quintile, thus adding an extra&#13;
burden to the already heavy junior secondary school costs.&#13;
1.34   Private schools play an important and growing role in East Java's JSE system,&#13;
accounting for about 45 percent of its total enrollments. It must be noted that private JSE&#13;
schools cater to a greater share of the poor population than the public sector, the main reason&#13;
being that, in the absence of public schools, many private schools operate in the afternoon, thus&#13;
giving poor children the opportunity to work in the morning.&#13;
1.35   Project Strategy. East Java's diversified and booming economy will increasingly&#13;
need a skilled labor force, and the industrializing urban centers will attract a steady migration&#13;
flow from rural and remote districts. Given these conditions, the project would focus more&#13;
particularly on the poor and isolated areas of the province, with the goal of providing greater&#13;
access to JSE through the construction of small (Kecil) schools (3 classrooms; see Annex 9).&#13;
In sparsely populated and remote areas, and also to cater to children who must work to help&#13;
support their families (the case of both urban and rural poor) the project would foster the&#13;
extension of the SMP Terbuka system (see para. 3.20 and Annex 9). Also, the project would&#13;
give support to 30,000 promising but poor students (2 percent of total enrollment) through the&#13;
extension of an existing scholarship program (see para 3.21).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                          11&#13;
1.36   To increase the market value of the JSE, the project would focus also on increasing the&#13;
quality of the education in East Java junior secondary schools. It would provide training to&#13;
about 18,000 teachers, with a specific focus on teachers with low level qualifications (see para.&#13;
3.24). To reduce teacher absenteeism in the schools located in remote areas the project would&#13;
support the construction of teacher dormitories for 56 schools (see para. 3.19). To help enhance&#13;
the classroom performance of teachers, a student assessment system would be progressively&#13;
put in place (see para. 3.26). Lastly, to improve the learning environment, the project would&#13;
support the construction of 231 libraries in existing and new schools, as well as the provision of&#13;
library books and of teaching aids to be used in class (see para. 3.22)&#13;
1.37   East Java will need, with 37 districts and a rapidly expanding education system, a&#13;
better and more efficient administrative system, and the project would provide for training of&#13;
staff at provincial, district, sub-district and school level on technical, managerial and&#13;
information processing skills (see paras. 3.31-35).&#13;
1.38   Projections. The following graph charts the planned increase in JSE enrollment&#13;
during the project lifetime and the demographic evolution of the 13-15 age cohort. It shows&#13;
that the growth of enrollment rates sponsored by the proposed project will be significantly&#13;
helped by a decrease in the age cohort (a result of East Java's successful family planning).&#13;

D. EAST NUSA TENGGARA&#13;
1.39   Socio-economic Framework. NTT presents a picture remarkably different from East&#13;
Java in terms of social and economic development. Its 3.3 million inhabitants are unevenly&#13;
spread over four main islands (and 38 minor ones) characterized by a semi-arid climate and a&#13;
mostly mountainous topography. Sixteen percent of the land area is cultivated, and only 10&#13;
percent of it can be irrigated. The growing demographic pressure, combined with the use of&#13;
slash and burn agriculture and overgrazing, is resulting in the progressive degradation of land.&#13;
The province has the lowest per capita regional GDP in the country, and a rate of economic&#13;
growth lower than the national average. Urbanization rate is low (11 percent), and&#13;
communication infrastructure is under-developed. With the exception of Kupang, the capital,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12              East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
there are only relatively small disparities in the traditional economic profile of the other 12&#13;
districts.&#13;
1.40   Agriculture remains the predominant activity, employing more than 80 percent of the&#13;
work force, but representing only 36 percent of the regional GDP; manufacturing is negligible.&#13;
Government is the second most important sector of employment, with 7.5 percent of NTT's&#13;
labor force on its payroll (5 percent nationally). In the last five years tourism has emerged as a&#13;
growth activity. Out-migration, a key factor in alleviating population pressure, has increased&#13;
sharply in the last decade, and in 1990 about 100,000 people left the islands for other provinces&#13;
of Indonesia (the negative migration balance reached 1.6 percent of total population in 1990).&#13;
There is also a strong but unreported international migration, and it is estimated that about&#13;
100,000 people (most of them hailing from Flores) have migrated to Malaysia.&#13;
1.41   Poverty is a key concem in NTT, as can be seen in its social indicators: 20 percent of&#13;
all villages are listed in the IDT program, 24 percent of the population lives under the poverty&#13;
line (the national figure is 15 percent), 69 percent of the population has monthly level of&#13;
expenditures below Rp 20,000 (as compared to 45 percent nationally), and lastly the incidence&#13;
of moderate and severe protein energy malnutrition is about 16 percent in rural areas. On the&#13;
other hand, given the economic conditions, the illiteracy rate is low, and at 22 percent compares&#13;
quite well with the 55 percent of East Timor, the 31 percent of Irian Jaya, or even the 23&#13;
percent of East Java.&#13;
1.42   Specific JSE Issues. Given NTT's lack of natural resources, struggling agriculture&#13;
and very weak industrialization, education remains the most important factor to help poor&#13;
people find their way out of poverty. Thus, one of GOI's project goals in NTT is to remove the&#13;
barriers of costs and distance that keep the children of poor families out of JSE, so as to&#13;
provide them with the opportunity to acquire the skills necessary to be competitive on the labor&#13;
market, either locally (in particular in the tourism industry, which lacks skilled workers), in&#13;
other provinces or abroad. A better education is also required to help improve the choice of&#13;
farming techniques.&#13;
1.43   In keeping with its overall economic situation, junior secondary education in NTT lags&#13;
far behind the national average, although NTT's achievement in that field is better than that of&#13;
provinces with a comparable background, thanks to a long tradition of active missionary&#13;
schools. Junior secondary education GER stood at 39 percent in 1993-94, or more than 15&#13;
points under the national average. There are no wide variations in enrollments between&#13;
districts: the lowest GER for 1993-94 was 32 percent in the district of Manggarai (Flores), as&#13;
opposed to 54 percent in Kupang, the capital.&#13;
1.44   Costs of JSE are comparatively much heavier to carry for poor households in NTT than&#13;
they are nationally, as direct costs to the household for junior secondary school are four times&#13;
higher than primary school costs (Rp 19,132 for primary and Rp 77,868 for junior secondary).&#13;
The difference between rural and urban areas is also much starker in NTT than it is nationally,&#13;
with 59 percent of urban children aged 13-15 enrolled in JSE, against only 15 percent for rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                             13&#13;
1.45   Project Strategy. NTT's main obstacles to the expansion of JSE are the overall&#13;
poverty of the population as well as the isolation and difficulty of access that characterize most&#13;
of the province. The project would support the provincial effort to increase access to JSE&#13;
through the construction of small (3 to 6 classrooms) schools in the remote areas where the&#13;
number of primary graduates would warrant the provision of junior secondary school facilities&#13;
(see para. 3.38), and in other areas would promote the extension of the SMP Terbuka system&#13;
(see para. 3.40 and Annex 9). The project would also provide support to about 5,000&#13;
promising but poor students (3 percent of total enrollment) through the extension and&#13;
improvement of an existing scholarship program (see para. 3.41).&#13;
1.46   Given the all-present poverty surrounding NTT schools and the lack of learning stimuli&#13;
in the families, it is particularly important to enrich the schools with selected instruments to&#13;
foster children's learning process. The project would provide for library books and teaching&#13;
aids, and in 40 cases would also support the construction of library rooms (see paras. 3.47-49).&#13;
To help teachers improve their skills the project would support training for about 4,000 of them&#13;
(see para. 3.44-45). Private religious schools have a long tradition in NIT due to the presence&#13;
of missionary foundations. The project would allocate quality improvement activities to them&#13;
commensurate with their share in JSE enrollments.&#13;
1.47   The isolation and the difficulty of communication that characterize most of NTT islands&#13;
also call for a strengthening of education administration, including the capacity to plan the&#13;
provincial education system and assess school needs, methods and products (see paras. 3.52-&#13;
54). The project would thus provide technical and managerial training and equipment&#13;
(particularly for information processing) to provincial, district, sub-district and school levels.&#13;
1.48   Projections. The following graph charts the planned increase in JSE enrollment&#13;
during the project lifetime and the growth of the 13-15 age group. It shows that unlike East&#13;
Java (see para. 1.38), cohort sizes in NTT will stabilize only towards the end of the project, and&#13;
that some of the growth in enrollments is attributable to demographic gains.&#13;

2. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY, LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
AND BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
A. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
2.1    As part of the Repelita VI (1994/99) program, the Govemment set the important goal&#13;
of extending access to high quality junior secondary education. This objective is integral to the&#13;
goal of attaining universal coverage of nine-years of basic education by the end of Repelita VIII&#13;
(2008/09). To support this ambitious goal, the Govermment has adopted several policy&#13;
measures and strategies (see Annex 10): (a) it plans to provide additional resources to basic&#13;
education, starting with an increase of 20 percent in the overall budget of education for the&#13;
1996/97 fiscal year; (b) it has abolished junior secondary school fees and admission&#13;
requirements for primary school graduates; (c) it is providing free textbooks for all primary and&#13;
junior secondary schoolchildren; (d) it is supporting private junior secondary schools with&#13;
public teachers and other inputs to maintain and even increase their significant enrollment&#13;
participation at this school level; (e) it continues to upgrade teachers skills for both public and&#13;
private schools through in-service programs; (f) it has started the construction or development&#13;
of regular or altemative JSE schools in rural and remote villages; (g) it has phased out all&#13;
diploma courses for the pre-service education of secondary school teachers (junior and senior)&#13;
so all new teachers at that level now need to have a SI (undergraduate) degree; (h) it is&#13;
upgrading existing junior secondary school teachers to D-EH (three-year post-secondary&#13;
diploma) at public expense; and (i) it is extending subsidies (scholarships) to capable but poor&#13;
students to begin or continue junior secondary education.&#13;
B. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.2   Integration of the following lessons from previous Bank projects would help build on&#13;
the exceptional performance of the Bank in the education sector in Indonesia. All the 22&#13;
previous projects (see Annex 12) have been judged satisfactory by the Operations Evaluation&#13;
Department (OED), and they have set the stage for the more challenging tasks in this sector.&#13;
OED Document, No. 9752, Indonesian Education and the World Bank: an Assessment of&#13;
Two Decades of Lending, 1991: (a) found that each of the previous projects was successfully&#13;
implemented; (b) concluded that Bank support in education projects was timely and gave&#13;
valuable encouragement to the Govemment; and (c) pointed out that as the projects were&#13;
achievements and successes, they also pointed to shortcomings in the quality of education and&#13;
fragmented management --issues being addressed by the present project.&#13;
2.3    OED Report. The 1991 report has several conclusions and recommendations that are&#13;
relevant for this project:&#13;
Issue: Institution building is basic to the long-term goal of increasing the self-&#13;
sufficiency of the Indonesian education system (p. 58)&#13;
Project response: Increased emphasis is placed on institution building and self-&#13;
management at provincial and district levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                         15&#13;
Issue: Projects must be discussed within the framework of policy dialogue (p. 65)&#13;
Project Response: Regular discussions between MOEC and the Bank on development&#13;
priorities and the role of the Bank vis-a-vis other donors have been instrumental in&#13;
determining agenda for Bank lending.&#13;
Issue: Despite explicit goals, projects have not always achieved equitable distribution&#13;
of project benefits to the poor (p. 68)&#13;
Project Response: Several project interventions are specifically targeted to the poor:&#13;
school construction in rural areas, SMP Terbuka and scholarship program.&#13;
Issue: Previous projects (mainly national in scope) were often overly complex or&#13;
underestimated absorption constraints, resulting in unsatisfactory implementation (p.&#13;
70)&#13;
Project Response: The project has been designed with extensive participation from&#13;
communities, existing schools, district and provincial MOEC staff&#13;
Issue: GOI should spend a greater amount of its budget on education, to achieve the&#13;
necessary quality and institutional objectives (p. 78)&#13;
Project Response: Indonesia's education expenditures are 14 percent of total&#13;
government budget; The 1996/97 budget shows an increase of 20 percent over last&#13;
year, of which 72 percent is spent on basic education (primary and junior secondary).&#13;
Issue: Despite its role in providing educational opportunities, the private system has&#13;
received limited support from GOI and the Bank (p.79)&#13;
Project Response: GOI is committed to ensuring that the contribution from the private&#13;
sector in junior secondary education is maintained and strengthened. Recent projects&#13;
have provided private schools with quality inputs.&#13;
2.4   Lessons from  Completed and Ongoing Secondary Education Projects. Other&#13;
lessons have been drawn or confirmed by the General Operational Review of Secondary&#13;
Education Projects by HDD. Implementation of the 1990 Indonesia Secondary Education and&#13;
Management Training Project (Ln. 2472-IND) and the ongoing Second Secondary Education&#13;
and Management Project (Ln. 3158-IND) are particularly relevant in this respect.&#13;
(a)    Overall Project Design. The completed and ongoing secondary education&#13;
projects have demonstrated that the expansion of secondary education should&#13;
be addressed through a dual strategy of increasing school places and improving&#13;
the quality of education. The proposed project would include both expansion&#13;
and quality improvement objectives, to ensure continual demand for education&#13;
and to improve repetition and drop-out rates.&#13;
(b)   Flexibility in the Design of Components. Attempts to impose standard&#13;
solutions to the variety of conditions in Indonesia have not been successful, and&#13;
GOI is working to correct this situation. The policy of limiting the size of&#13;
government schools to a minimum of nine classrooms has been reviewed, to&#13;
allow public schools to be established in small communities with lower&#13;
demand, and experimentation has started with JSE alternative models.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16             East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
(c)    Ownership and Participation. Local communities contribute significantly to&#13;
the development of education in their areas. Stakeholders and clients are well&#13;
placed to assess project processes, fully measure project outcomes, and to help&#13;
develop appropriate corrective measures.  They know when children are&#13;
learning and how investments in schools are being used.  Stakeholder&#13;
involvement was emphasized during the preparation process (see Annex 11)&#13;
and will be promoted under the project by providing assistance and incentives&#13;
for both private and public schools.&#13;
C.    BANK STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.5   This project--one of the first in a series of junior secondary education projects--&#13;
supports the Bank's 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia, which was&#13;
presented to the Board on March 21, 1995. The CAS endorses Government's role towards&#13;
establishing a regulatory framework and in supporting decentralization and participation. In&#13;
addition, the CAS highlights the importance of continued emphasis on human resource&#13;
development to promote economic growth, competitiveness, and structural transformation, and&#13;
on a more selective, efficient use of public resources. The design of the proposed project is&#13;
also consistent with the Bank's strategy of balanced assistance to the education sector, which&#13;
includes ongoing and proposed assistance for (a) improving the quality of primary education,&#13;
including possible interventions in early childhood development, (b) expansion and quality&#13;
improvement of junior secondary education, (c) quality improvement of senior secondary&#13;
education, (d) selective interventions in higher education, and (e) an active policy dialogue&#13;
designed to redefine and re-focus the Government's role in the education sector.&#13;
2.6   The Bank's comparative advantage in supporting junior secondary education is based&#13;
on its long-standing and close working relationship with MOEC. The Bank has engaged in a&#13;
comprehensive dialogue with MOEC that reaches far beyond this project itself, since it has&#13;
helped: (a) establish a solid conceptual and economic framework for the expansion and&#13;
qualification of junior secondary education and basic education in Indonesia over the next 20&#13;
years; (b) identify the comparative advantages for Bank's and other donors' role in the planned&#13;
expansion and qualification process; and (c) strengthen the decentralizing trends toward sub-&#13;
central levels, province-specific projects, and local ownership. As a result of this dialogue, the&#13;
previous highly centralized, uniform approach to project design and implementation has been&#13;
abandoned and has been replaced by an approach that will rest on province-based projects.&#13;
The Govemment has now recognized the need to take into account specific provincial&#13;
situations, including economic growth trends and prospects, the existing education needs, labor&#13;
market conditions, private sector delivery capacity, levels of poverty, and geographic&#13;
conditions. The Bank has also been an active partner in the discussions on the priorities&#13;
govering basic education delivery, on the role of the private sector in secondary education and&#13;
on the share of Govemment spending that should be allocated to basic education.&#13;
2.7   The Bank is a trusted partner in basic education in Indonesia and has substantial&#13;
experience working with the Indonesian Govemment in this sector (see Annex 12). Based on&#13;
the Bank's worldwide experience, GOI sought the Bank's advice on such issues as lower-cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                          17&#13;
altematives for junior secondary education, how to improve quality and how to tailor the&#13;
proposed increased access programs to local needs. The proposed project represents one in an&#13;
overall program of Bank support for expansion and quality improvements in basic education.&#13;
Currently, the Bank is actively preparing two other secondary education projects and the&#13;
Government has requested that the Bank provide both financial and technical assistance for&#13;
future projects. The junior secondary education development program is supported by other&#13;
donors, including ADB and OECF. This project complements the assistance to basic education&#13;
provided by several ongoing projects&#13;
(a)    Second Secondary Education and Management Project. This project (Ln.&#13;
3158-IND), approved in 1990, consisted of provision of quality inputs in&#13;
secondary schools (teacher training, equipment and books); a review and&#13;
redesign of the student assessment system; and a redesign of the information&#13;
management system. After initial problems, mainly due to the large national&#13;
scope, the project was restructured to operate in five pilot provinces, with&#13;
satisfactory results. The implementation experience from this project has&#13;
provided the basis for the design of the current project. In addition, the Bank&#13;
is now very familiar with the issues and the agencies involved in this subsector.&#13;
(b)   The Primary and Secondary School Teacher Development Projects.&#13;
These 1992 and 1996 projects (Ln. 3496-lND and 3979-1ND) address pre-&#13;
service teacher training and complement the current project in the preparation&#13;
and quality improvements of teachers. Substantial coordination between pre-&#13;
service and in-service training is achieved through the concurrent&#13;
implementation of these projects.  The Bank is also heavily involved in&#13;
ensuring that maximum coordination is achieved between Teacher&#13;
Development Projects and the in-service training components of the junior&#13;
secondary education projects.&#13;
(c)    The Primary Education Quality Improvement Project. Approved in 1992,&#13;
this project (Ln. 3448-IND) provides quality inputs in primary schools in six&#13;
provinces. The issues related to primary schools that impact on transition, to&#13;
enrollments and quality in, junior secondary schools are being addressed in this&#13;
project on a limited scale. Project impact is now being reviewed, to determine&#13;
the further strategies for implementation on a larger scale.&#13;
(d)   The Book and Reading Development Project.  (Ln. 3887-IND).  The&#13;
project started implementation in September 1995, aiming to provide free&#13;
textbooks on a one-to-one basis to all public and private primary and junior&#13;
secondary education students in all subjects. The project provides one of the&#13;
most essential quality inputs into basic education on a systematic basis, and&#13;
complements the proposed junior secondary education Projects.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The project would assist the Government of Indonesia in addressing the quality and&#13;
coverage of junior secondary education in the provinces of East Java and NTT. The project's&#13;
objectives are to:&#13;
(a) expand access to junior secondary education in a cost-effective and equitable way;&#13;
(b) improve the teaching of junior secondary education; and&#13;
(c) strengthen the management capacity at all levels of the education system.&#13;
B. PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
3.2   Project impact will be assessed using the following indicators (see Annex 13):&#13;
a) the increase in enrollment in new junior secondary schools and altemative programs as a&#13;
percentage of total capacity created in these schools and programs;&#13;
b) the increase in enrollment in each subdistrict as a percentage of the expected enrollment in&#13;
the new capacity created in the subdistrict schools, by grade;&#13;
c) the increase in student examination scores, by province, district, subject, and public and&#13;
private schools; and&#13;
d) the proportion of the work program implemented as measured by the physical targets and&#13;
budget spent annually for project and routine activities in project province.&#13;
C. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
3.3   The project has been organized into three major components to address the main issues&#13;
identified in the junior secondary education system of East Java and NTT:&#13;
* Access to Junior Secondary Education: The project would support the efforts to (a)&#13;
increase the number of places available at junior secondary level by adding classrooms to&#13;
existing schools and building new schools located closer to the potential JSE demand,&#13;
particularly in poor and remote areas; (b) provide existing and new Open JSE with&#13;
instructional material and training for tutors; (c) help promising but poor students get&#13;
access to JSE through the expansion and improvement of the existing scholarship program;&#13;
and (d) stimulate demand for JSE through a social marketing effort. At negotiations the&#13;
Government gave assurances that it would (i) award scholarships, and (ii) select&#13;
locations for the construction of schools in accordance with criteria acceptable to the&#13;
Bank (para. 7.1(a)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                           19&#13;
Education Quality: The project would focus on some key factors of education quality,&#13;
principally teachers and instructional materials. It would thus (a) provide training to under-&#13;
qualified teachers, with a specific focus on teachers in isolated areas; (b) help insure&#13;
teachers' presence in remote areas through the provision of teacher dormitories; (c) support&#13;
the construction of library rooms and the provision of library books; (d) support a study of&#13;
best teaching methods for science education, and (e) help establish a Student Performance&#13;
Assessment to provide teachers and principals with academic feedback. At negotiations&#13;
the Government gave assurances that it would (i) employ contract teachers, and (ii) select&#13;
locations for the construction of teacher dormitories in accordance with criteria&#13;
acceptable to the Bank (para. 7. 1(a)).&#13;
*  Education Management: In order to augment the capacity of the administrative system to&#13;
provide greater access to, and improve the quality of, JSE the project would help (a)&#13;
expand the managerial skills of staff at central, provincial, district, sub-district and school&#13;
levels, (b) improve information management and utilization, and (c) augment the&#13;
equipment in province and district offices.  At negotiations the Government gave&#13;
assurances that it would select candidates for management training in accordance with&#13;
criteria acceptable to the Bank (para. 7. 1 (a)).&#13;
D. PROJECT TARGETING&#13;
3.4    Poverty targeting. The project would target remote and rural areas with the lowest&#13;
junior secondary GER and the highest rate of IDT villages, and within these areas priority&#13;
would be given to IDT villages (see Annex 14). In that context, a comparatively larger share of&#13;
resources (in proportion to population) will be allocated to NT[, as the province significantly&#13;
lags behind the rest of the country in terms of education achievements. The project would help&#13;
build 55 percent of the classrooms needed in NTT, and 13 percent in East Java. In both&#13;
provinces the project would also specifically target promising but poor students through the&#13;
extension and improvement of the existing MOEC Scholarship Program.&#13;
3.5    Private education. Beside supporting public education, the project would devote a&#13;
substantial amount of resources to improve the quality and management of private education,&#13;
so as to help reduce the disparity between public and private education and encourage parents&#13;
to view private schooling as a worthwhile option. Specifically, private schools would benefit&#13;
directly from: (a) teacher in-service training; (b) provision of teaching equipment and materials;&#13;
(c) provision of reference and library books; and (d) management training for school principals.&#13;
In addition, private schools would benefit indirectly from such project activities as improved&#13;
Kanwil management, monitoring, and evaluation of schools and students. These efforts are in&#13;
line with Government policy (explicitly stated in Repelita VI) that private schools should&#13;
preserve and even increase their share of total junior secondary enrollments. The public sector&#13;
already devotes significant amounts of resources to support and improve the quality of private&#13;
schools, in particular through the secondment of public sector teachers to private schools,&#13;
distribution of approved textbooks free of charge, and operational cost subsidies to private&#13;
schools at the lower end of financial viability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20              East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
E. PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
3.6    The economic analysis conducted for the pr ject consists of (i) analysis of educational&#13;
demand and the rationale for public investment in junior secondary education; (ii) fiscal&#13;
analysis; (iii) review of alternatives; and (iv) cost-benefit analysis. Details in Annex 1.&#13;
3.7    Demand.  There are both efficiency and equity grounds for additional public&#13;
intervention in junior secondary education in Indonesia today. It is primarily the poor and near-&#13;
poor (and mostly those in rural areas) who are not enrolling in school and whose participation&#13;
declined in the late 1980s to early 1990s. One of the primary factors explaining the low&#13;
demand is the high direct costs of education. A second factor is indirect (opportunity) costs&#13;
which exacerbated the effect of high direct costs. Coupled with stagnant real wages in the&#13;
1 980s and the effects of cuts in public expenditure on basic education in the mid- I 980s (school&#13;
construction came to a virtual halt), these factors contributed to faltering demand. The past two&#13;
years have seen the reversal of these trends as enrollment rates have risen significantly in all&#13;
provinces.&#13;
3.8    Budget. Since investment in junior secondary education is desirable on both efficiency&#13;
and equity grounds, the key questions for the Government are the budgetary implications of the&#13;
expansion and how to expand the system. The budgetary implications of the expansion are&#13;
sizable ($7.6 billion; see Annex 1 and para 1.8), but estimation shows that the policy is&#13;
attainable if the economy continues to grow at the rate achieved in recent decades, additional&#13;
funds are made available to junior secondary including extemal borrowing, and the private&#13;
sector retains its current significant share.&#13;
3.9    Review of Alternatives. Analysis of altematives considered the role of the private&#13;
sector in the expansion program and the fiscal implications of mainly public expansions versus&#13;
one which made room for private expansion. The budgetary implications double in the second&#13;
scenario ($14.5 billion compared to $7.6 billion). There are additional merits to preserving the&#13;
private sector. First, given the current and projected surplus of teacher candidates, a robust&#13;
private sector is an effective means for helping to clear the market for teachers. Second,&#13;
madrasah schools (religious schools which currently enroll about 20 percent of junior&#13;
secondary students) offer access to junior secondary in small, poor communities and at a cost&#13;
that is significantly lower than even MOEC-supervised private schools. These schools also&#13;
enroll a higher proportion of girls than boys, reflecting the preference pattem of some famnilies&#13;
for non-secular education. Third, maintaining the share of private schools at the junior&#13;
secondary level establishes the basis for sustaining the even larger share of private schools at&#13;
the senior secondary level (54 percent of enrollments in 1993/94).&#13;
3.10   Beyond the public/private altematives, the Govemment has experimented with&#13;
alternative modes (see Annex 1, section im; and Annex 6) of delivering junior secondary&#13;
education (in respect of the regular SMP model). These include: SMP Kecil and SMP&#13;
Terbuka. While not entirely substitutes for each other (or to the regular SMPs), and&#13;
experimentation to improve their quality is still ongoing, preliminary unit cost comparisons&#13;
indicate that gains can be achieved by utilizing these less costly altemative models of junior&#13;
secondary education in rural and remote areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.11   Economic Rate of Return. The economic rate of return for the project investment is&#13;
estimated by province and component (increasing access and enhancing quality, but excluding&#13;
the management component -see para. 3.3). The estimates are obtained by solving for the&#13;
intemal rate of return that equates a stream of benefits and costs resulting from the investment&#13;
over a thirty year horizon. The benefits of the projects are derived from the increased numbers&#13;
of students enrolled in junior secondary in any given year, but also include the additional stream&#13;
of students expected to proceed to senior secondary and tertiary education. A monetary value&#13;
of the benefits of each stream of beneficiaries is estimated using the difference in wages&#13;
between one level of education and the next. Benefits will also accrue from investments in&#13;
enhancing quality of junior secondary. A benchmark assumption of a 15 percent additional&#13;
wage premium earned by a higher quality graduate is made. High returns were found for both&#13;
quality and access components, with returns on quality enhancements generally higher than for&#13;
expansion of access, particularly in NTT, as noted in Table 3.2 below.&#13;
Table 3.2&#13;
Rates of Return to Project Investments&#13;
by Component and Province&#13;

Total               18.3         16.0&#13;
3.12   Simulations were run varying some of the underlying assumptions. In all, the main&#13;
variables to which the system appears to be most sensitive are those affecting quality. This is&#13;
not surprising given the large numbers of beneficiaries which are impacted by this investment.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis reveals, for example, that the rate of return for quality inputs declines from&#13;
16 to 12 percent in East Java if only a 10 percent increase (instead of 15 percent) in additional&#13;
wage premium for higher quality graduates is assumed; the rate of return declines from 22 to&#13;
20.6 percent if incremental recurrent costs for quality improvements in NTT increases from&#13;
US$8 per student to US$10.&#13;
3.13   Impact on Poverty. Those not enrolled in junior secondary today are predominantly&#13;
from the lowest four income deciles. The project will reach these poor and near-poor through&#13;
its poverty-targeted sub-components. Approximately 35,350 scholarships will be awarded to&#13;
poor (and capable) students. Approximately 12,000 Kecil and 20,000 Terbuka student places&#13;
will be created, implying 8,000 Kecil and Terbuka graduates per year for the next 10 years. In&#13;
all, the project will contribute to offset the geographical and financial obstacles barring poorer&#13;
children from JSE schools, thus reducing social inequality in education access.&#13;
3.14   Impact on Women. Female enrollment rates in JSE in East Java and NTT are at par&#13;
with male enrollment rates (see box on p. 8). This means that approximately half of those who&#13;
will benefit from the proposed project's improvement in JSE access and quality would be&#13;
young women (approximately 300,000). In a longer term perspective, opportunities for&#13;
women to have access to higher levels of education and better work opportunities would&#13;
improve (see para. 1.6). In remote areas, moving to the nearest (but still distant) JSE school&#13;
and living in friends' houses is a constraint particularly affecting girls, who thus will benefit the&#13;
most from the JSE schools to be built in their neighborhood.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22             East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
F. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.15   To meet the three defined objectives (para. 3.1), and specify the components identified&#13;
above (para. 3.3), the following activities would be implemented in the public and private&#13;
junior secondary school subsystems of East Java and NTT.&#13;
East Java&#13;
3.16  The project would focus on expanding and improving the human resources required for&#13;
the continuing development of East Java's dynamic economy (see paras. 1.26-1.30). The&#13;
estimated project baseline costs of US$83.6 million for East Java would complement the&#13;
efforts of the Government and other donors in increasing junior secondary education&#13;
enrollments (access) and improving its quality, with special emphasis on rural and remote&#13;
areas where poverty and lack of schools have hampered the drive for a more balanced&#13;
development of the provincial economy. To this end, the project would upgrade the skills&#13;
needed for a more efficient school and provincial system management. The five-year project&#13;
would create 56,000 additional student places in remote villages of East Java where JSE&#13;
enrollments rates have been sluggish (less than 50 percent rural average) or schools too distant&#13;
(more than a three-hour walk from home). This would generate approximately 120,000&#13;
additional JSE graduates in 15 years.&#13;
Access&#13;
3.17  Increasing Access to Junior Secondary Education (US$53.3 million equivalent over&#13;
five years, excluding contingencies). This component would be targeted to remote areas. It&#13;
would include some new school construction, support for Open (Terbuka) junior secondary&#13;
education, a scholarship system, and a social marketing scheme to foster junior secondary&#13;
education support among stakeholders, particularly parents.&#13;
3.18   New Schools Construction (US$40 million equivalent). Using an average ratio of 40&#13;
students per classroom, the province's needs in terms of school and classroom construction&#13;
were computed on the basis of a projected enrollment rate of 75 percent in year 2000-01. The&#13;
proposed project would support the construction of 169 schools in the next five years (124 type&#13;
D or 6-classroom schools and 45 type E or 3-classroom schools) representing 13 percent of&#13;
total provincial needs. This would increase school capacity by about 35,000 places. IDT&#13;
villages (as a strong correlate with poverty and community activities) would be a preferred&#13;
place for school construction (see Annex 15). Land for school construction will be acquired by&#13;
the Government as part of total project costs. The balance of classroom construction needs&#13;
would be covered by the national development budget (APBN), an OECF project, and private&#13;
resources.&#13;
3.19   The project would support the construction of 56 teacher dormitories.  These&#13;
dormitories would be built to accommodate teachers of schools in remote areas (see Annex&#13;
15).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                         23&#13;
3.20   Support for Open (Terbuka) JSE (US$ 1.6 million equivalent). By the year 2001&#13;
210 Open (Terbuka) JSE are planned to be operating in East Java with GOI resources and&#13;
other donors' help. The project would support the distribution of a set of learning material and&#13;
reference books and book cases to the local Learning Centers (TKP), where students meet four&#13;
aftemoons a week to study. It would also provide for 10-day training sessions for 3,000 of the&#13;
local tutors who supervise the Learning Groups. The training program for tutors will be&#13;
designed and discussed with the Bank (see Annex 9).&#13;
3.21    Scholarship Program (US$11.6 million equivalent). The project would support an&#13;
expansion of the existing Kanwil-managed scholarship scheme, after evaluation of its impact&#13;
and review of its implementation mechanisms. The scholarship would provide 25,000 Rp. per&#13;
month (for 12 months and normally for three years) to each selected student. Eligibility criteria&#13;
(see Annex 16) would focus principally on the family's income level and the student's school&#13;
performance. The scholarship would be offered to 30,000 (2 percent of total enrollment)&#13;
students in East Java&#13;
3.22   Social Marketing. (US$0.1 million equivalent). Social marketing would be used to&#13;
develop parents' awareness of the benefits to be derived from JSE, and to build up the&#13;
commitment of key stakeholders (teachers, local administrative staff, community or religious&#13;
leaders) to the goals of the project. The activities to be carried out under the social marketing&#13;
program would include the preparation, design, printing and diffusion of posters and pamphlets&#13;
(target: communities, schools, Kecamatan, Kandeps); the preparation, production and diffusion&#13;
of radio messages (target: parents and teachers); the production and viewing of video tapes&#13;
(target: Ministry and Kanwil staff, Governors, Bupati, politicians, journalists); the organization&#13;
of two province-wide seminars (target: Kandeps and Kecamatan staff); and the organization of&#13;
a national contest for the best song promoting education. The component will be prepared and&#13;
managed under CPCU leadership (with funding under the Central Indonesia Junior Secondary&#13;
Education Project, including an international consultant) and will be implemented under PIUs&#13;
responsibility (with project funding). A national consultant will be hired for five months (both&#13;
for East Java and NTT, see para 3.22 and 3.42) for the initial analysis, design of components,&#13;
and test of proposals. The production and dissemination phases will be carried out under PPIU&#13;
responsibility. Objectives, activities responsibilities and calendar have been discussed with&#13;
GOI and will be part of the Project Implementation Handbook (see para. 5.8).&#13;
Quality.&#13;
3.23   Improving the Quality of Junior Secondary Education  (US$24.4 million&#13;
equivalent over five years, excluding contingencies). It is expected that a higher quality level&#13;
of JSE will better equip JSE graduates to meet the needs of East Java's changing labor market,&#13;
and thus increase household demand for JSE. This component would include teacher training,&#13;
school libraries and teaching aids, provision of science kits and the development of a study on&#13;
alternatives for teaching JSE science, and the development of a student performance&#13;
assessment system.&#13;
3.24  In-service Teacher Training (US$4.2 million equivalent).  About 50 percent of&#13;
public school teachers in East Java have qualification under the required minimum level of D-3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24              East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
(three-year post-secondary diploma). The project would train these teachers, focusing on the&#13;
use of appropriate teaching methods (see Annex 5). The project would train 9,360 teachers&#13;
from remote areas schools through the PKG Model C, and would provide support for 37,330&#13;
teachers undergoing training with the MGMP system (in both cases including private schools).&#13;
This component would be expected to improve teachers' classroom performance, and thus to&#13;
have an impact on students' learning and national examination scores (see paras. 1.14-1.18 and&#13;
Annex 5).&#13;
3.25   On a pilot basis, the project would support the hiring for rural schools of up to 100&#13;
"contract teachers" (with an emphasis on female teachers) in core academic areas such as&#13;
Bahasa Indonesia, Mathematics, Science Education and English, where there is a constant&#13;
deficit. Criteria for the new contract modality was discussed with GOI authorities (see Annex&#13;
17). Their contracts would be tied to a specific school and would be discontinued if the teacher&#13;
leaves that school or does not meet his/her teaching requirements (see para. 1.14).&#13;
3.26   Student Performance Assessment (US$0.3 million equivalent). To design and help&#13;
implement this Student Performance Assessment System (see para. 1.19) the project would&#13;
support an initial thorough assessment of the needs and resource requirements for&#13;
implementing the system, especially those related to classroom assessment. A second phase&#13;
would include training of teachers on how to design good tests and use their results as a&#13;
quality-fostering instrument; and setting up the system for student performance assessment&#13;
analysis at Kanwil level, and establishing the feedback system designed to send the information&#13;
back to the classrooms. This strategy will benefit from technical expertise (doctors and&#13;
masters in education at central and provincial level) and the respective hardware and software&#13;
provided by the Second Secondary Education and Management Project. The project would&#13;
provide equipment, domestic consultant services and training.&#13;
3.27   School Libraries and Teaching Aids (US$19.9 million equivalent). Fifty-eight&#13;
percent of schools in East Java lack a proper library, and to correct this deficiency the&#13;
proposed project would support the construction of 231 library rooms. To offset the current&#13;
paucity of reading material in existing libraries, the project would provide to each library a set&#13;
of reading and supplementary books (at the rate of three books per student), and 50 reference&#13;
books (including dictionaries) to be used by teachers and students (see para. 1.20).&#13;
3.28   To encourage ownership, library attendance and reading promotion, principals will&#13;
select reading, supplementary and reference books more suitable to their cultural environment&#13;
and students' preferences. Based on the book lists prepared by MOEC, the school principals in&#13;
consultation with teachers, students and the teacher-librarian would make the final book&#13;
selection and submit their requests to the PPIU, which would, in turn, consolidate the requests&#13;
and place the orders. The principals may select books not included in the MOEC book list,&#13;
provided that they then be approved by MOEC. Reading books would initiate or support&#13;
reading habits; supplementary books would expand curricular and textbook contents; and&#13;
reference books such as encyclopedias and dictionaries would serve as consultation and&#13;
research instruments.&#13;
3.29   The project would also provide teaching aids such as mathematical games, maps,&#13;
globes, videos, and overhead projectors for the additional schools to be built under the projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                           25&#13;
One hundred and sixty-nine packages would be provided to the new schools, 350 to existing&#13;
schools and 50 to private schools. The use of didactic materials and equipment is expected to&#13;
foster: (a) more active leaming in classroom and beyond; (b) more cooperative classroom&#13;
work; and (c) more productive use of teachers classroom time. School principals and teachers&#13;
would have a word in selecting the didactic materials best fitting their students' needs and&#13;
interests.&#13;
3.30   Science and Technology Education. The project would: (a) provide simple science&#13;
kits to the new schools' science teachers; and (b) in order to identify the best education strategy&#13;
to teach JSE science and technology, the project would support a study of different teaching&#13;
approaches in a sample of 60 representative (urban, rural, private, public) schools (plus 60&#13;
control-group school). The study, coordinated by the CPCU, would be conducted for two&#13;
years in East Java (and NTT, see para. 3.51) with the help of qualified specialists on science&#13;
education and experienced researchers. The hands-on approach fostered by the 'hew science"&#13;
movement would be emphasized. The results of this study would be used by MOEC to revise&#13;
the teaching of science education at JSE level and the design of the corresponding textbooks&#13;
(See Annex 6 for the Terms of Reference).&#13;
Management.&#13;
3.31   Strengthening Education Management (US$4.0 million equivalent over five years,&#13;
excluding contingencies). This component would help the provincial, district, sub-district and&#13;
school administrations build implementation and managerial capacity through professional&#13;
training, implementation of an information system, and provision of office equipment.&#13;
3.32   Management Training (US$2.7 million equivalent). GOI is de-concentrating the&#13;
education management by giving Kanwils and Kandep/Kanin increased responsibilities over&#13;
regional and local matters and in project implementation. The project would provide&#13;
managerial and technical training to administrative staff at central, provincial, district, sub-&#13;
district and school levels. Training would cover about 50 staff from the Kanwil, and 230 staff&#13;
from the 37 Kandeps, or an average of 6 by Kandep. At Kanwil and Kandep level the&#13;
emphasis would be on planming (including micro-planning), policy analysis, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation and education data analysis and dissemination. At sub-district level training would&#13;
focus on education data management. At school level training would help principals of all&#13;
public, private and religious junior secondary schools enrich their skills in supporting teachers&#13;
and students, developing community participation and managing school facilities (Annex 7).&#13;
3.33   The development of managerial skills will be further supported by the publication of a&#13;
set of approximately ten booklets to be used as education management handbooks by teachers,&#13;
managers and supervisors on matters such as strategies of teaching-learning interaction in&#13;
classroom, the effective use of school library, test design and uses, school environment, and&#13;
community involvement. For distribution to project schools, Kecamatans, Kandeps, Kanwils,&#13;
Dikmenum and the other higher instances of the administration, a total of 2,500 sets will be&#13;
distributed in East Java (see para. 1.22).&#13;
3.34   The expected changes (in skills, processes, efficiency, general behavior and client&#13;
orientation) resulting from this professional training will be assessed with technical audits and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26             East Java and NIT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
user satisfaction surveys (see Annex 7) covering the main stakeholders (from the parent&#13;
association up to the higher level of the administrative system).&#13;
3.35  Information Management and Utilization (US$1.2 million equivalent for East&#13;
Java). The capacity of provincial and district education admninistration to manage and efficiently&#13;
use information must be enhanced in light of the intended deconcentration of project&#13;
implementation (see para. 1.23). Three information functions would be modemized by the&#13;
project: (a) forecasting, planning and monitoring by Kanwil and Kandeps; (b) data processing&#13;
(MIS) by Dikmenum and Kanwil; and (c) school education data management by Kandeps.&#13;
The project would provide technical assistance for the development of these functions,&#13;
analytical and skill training for administrative staff, software and equipment.&#13;
NTT (East Nusa Tenggara)&#13;
3.36   The purpose of the project in developing junior secondary education in NTT is to help&#13;
alleviate poverty-related problems in the province, support incipient modernization efforts in&#13;
the economy, and strengthen cooperation with private education. In proportional terms, NTT&#13;
has been given a larger (than East Java) share (an estimated baseline cost of US$40.9 million)&#13;
of project resources to help the Government and other donors compensate for NTT lower rates&#13;
of junior secondary education enrollments and widespread rural poverty. Under the project,&#13;
access to junior secondary education would be increased, its quality supported and&#13;
management capacity upgraded at schools and in the whole provincial system. In five years,&#13;
the project would open access to 39,000 new students in rural and remote areas of NTT where&#13;
enrollments rates are low or JSE unavailable. As a result of the project, there would be&#13;
102,000 additional JSE graduates in 15 years.&#13;
Access.&#13;
3.37  Increasing Access to Junior Secondary Education (US$3 1.1 million equivalent over&#13;
five years, excluding contingencies). This component would be targeted to remote areas. It&#13;
would include some new school construction and extension to increase current capacity,&#13;
learning material for Open JSE, a scholarship system, and a social marketing scheme to foster&#13;
junior secondary education support among stakeholders, particularly parents.&#13;
3.38   Classrooms and New Schools Construction (US$28.1 million equivalent). Using an&#13;
average ratio of 40 students per classroom, the province's needs in terms of school and&#13;
classroom construction were computed on the basis of a projected enrollment rate of 60 percent&#13;
in year 2000-01. The project would support the construction of 763 new classrooms (52 type&#13;
D or six-classroom schools, 56 type E or three-classroom schools and 283 additional&#13;
classrooms) representing 55 percent of total province needs. This construction component&#13;
would increase school capacity by about 30,520. IDT villages (as a strong correlate with&#13;
poverty and community activities) would be a preferred place for school construction (see&#13;
Annex 15). Land for school construction will be acquired by the Govemment as part of total&#13;
project costs. The balance of classroom construction needs would be covered by the national&#13;
development budget (APBN), an OECF project, and private resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                        27&#13;
3.39   The project would also support the construction of 56 teacher dormitories to be built&#13;
alongside every new type E school planned for remote areas (see Annex 15).&#13;
3.40   Support for Open JSE Terbuka (US$0.8 million equivalent). By the year 2001 81&#13;
Open JSE are planned to be operating in NTT with GOI resources and other donors' help. The&#13;
project would support the distribution of a set of learning material and reference books and&#13;
book cases to the local Learning Centers (TKP). It would also provide for 10-day training&#13;
sessions for 1,050 tutors who supervise the Learning Centers (see Annex 9).&#13;
3.41   Scholarship Program (US$2.1 million equivalent). The project would support an&#13;
expansion of the existing Kanwil-managed scholarship scheme, after evaluation of its impact&#13;
and review of its implementation mechanisms. The scholarship would provide 25,000 Rp. per&#13;
month (for 12 months and normally for three years) to each selected student. Eligibility criteria&#13;
(see Annex 16) would focus principally on the family's income level and the student's school&#13;
performance. It was proposed that the scholarship be offered to 5,350 students or 3 percent of&#13;
total JSE enrollment in NTT.&#13;
3.42  Social Marketing (US$50,000 equivalent).  Social marketing would be used to&#13;
develop parents' awareness of the benefits to be derived from JSE, and to build up the&#13;
commitment of key stakeholders (teachers, local administrative staff, community or religious&#13;
leaders) to the goals of the project. The activities to be carried out under the social marketing&#13;
program would include the preparation, design, printing and diffusion of posters and pamphlets&#13;
(target: communities, schools, Kecamatan, Kandeps); the preparation, production and diffusion&#13;
of radio messages (target: parents and teachers); the production and viewing of video tapes&#13;
(target: Ministry and Kanwil staff, Govemors, Bupati, politicians, joumalists); the organization&#13;
of two province-wide seminars (target: Kandeps and Kecamatan staff); and the organization of&#13;
a national contest for the best song promoting education. The component will be prepared and&#13;
managed under CPCU leadership (with funding under the Central Indonesia Junior Secondary&#13;
Education Project, including an intemational consultant) and will be implemented under PPIUs&#13;
responsibility (with project funding). A national consultant will be hired for five months (both&#13;
for East Java and NTT, see para 3.22 and 3.42) for the initial analysis, design of components,&#13;
and test of proposals. The production and dissemination phases will be carried out under PPIU&#13;
responsibility. Objectives, activities responsibilities and calendar have been discussed with&#13;
GOI and will be part of the Project Implementation Handbook (see para. 5.8).&#13;
Quality.&#13;
3.43  Improving the Quality of Junior Secondary Educafion (US$6.8 million equivalent&#13;
over five years, excluding contingencies). It is expected that a higher quality level of JSE will&#13;
better equip JSE graduates to face poverty-related constraints and meet the incipient needs of&#13;
NTT's economy, and thus increase household demand for JSE. This project component would&#13;
include teacher training, school libraries and teaching aids, provision of science kits and the&#13;
development of a study on alternatives for teaching JSE science, and the development of a&#13;
student performance assessment system.&#13;
3.44  In-service Teacher Training (US$1.8 million equivalent). About 80 percent of&#13;
teachers in NTT have qualification under the required minimum level of D-3 (three-year post-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28              East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
secondary diploma). The project would train these teachers, focusing on the use of appropriate&#13;
teaching methods (see Annex 5). The project would traim 2,990 teachers from remote area&#13;
schools through the PKG Model C, and would provide support for 4,490 teachers undergoing&#13;
training with the MGMP system. This component would be expected to improve teachers'&#13;
classroom performance, and thus to have an impact on students' learning and national&#13;
examination scores (see paras. 1.14-1.18).&#13;
3.45   On a pilot basis, the project will support the hiring of up to 50 "contract teachers" for&#13;
rural schools in academic areas such as Bahasa Indonesia, Mathematics, Science Education&#13;
and English, where teachers are often lacking. Criteria for the new contract modality were&#13;
discussed with GOI authorities (see Annex 17). Their contracts would be tied to a specific&#13;
school and would be discontinued if the teacher leaves that school or does not meet contractual&#13;
requirements (see para 1.14).&#13;
3.46   Student Performance Assessment. (US$ 0.1 million equivalent). To design and help&#13;
implement this Student Performance Assessment System (see para. 1.19) the project would&#13;
support an initial thorough assessment of the needs and resource requirements for&#13;
implementing the system, especially those related to classroom assessment. A second phase&#13;
would include training of teachers on how to design good tests and use their results as a&#13;
quality-fostering instrument; and setting up the system for student performance assessment&#13;
analysis at Kanwil level, and establishing the feedback system designed to send the information&#13;
back to the classrooms. This strategy will benefit from technical expertise (doctors and&#13;
masters in education at central and provincial level) and the respective hardware and software&#13;
provided by the Second Secondary Education and Management Project. The project would&#13;
provide equipment, domestc consultant services and training.&#13;
3.47   School Libraries and Teaching Aids (US$4.9 million equivalent).  Seventy nine&#13;
percent of NTT schools lack a proper library, and to correct this deficiency the proposed&#13;
project would support the construction of 40 library rooms. To offset the current paucity of&#13;
reading material in existing libraries, the project would provide to each library a set of reading&#13;
and supplementary books (at the rate of three books per student), 50 reference books (including&#13;
dictionaries) to be used by teachers and students (see para 1.20).&#13;
3.48   To encourage ownership, library attendance and reading promotion, principals will&#13;
select reading, supplementary and reference books more suitable to their cultural environment&#13;
and students' preferences. Based on the book lists proposed by MOEC, the school principals&#13;
in consultation with teachers, students and the teacher-librarian would make the final book&#13;
selection and submit their requests to the PPIU, which would, in turn, consolidate the requests&#13;
and place the orders. The principal may select books not included in the MOEC booklist,&#13;
provided that they then get MOEC approval. Reading books would initiate or support reading&#13;
habits; supplementary books would expand curricular and textbook contents; and reference&#13;
books such as encyclopedias and dictionaries would serve as consultation and research&#13;
instruments.&#13;
3.49   The project would also provide teaching aids such as mathematical games, maps,&#13;
globes, videos, and overhead projectors for the additional schools to be built under the projects.&#13;
One hundred and eight packages would be provided to the new schools, 55 to existing public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                           29&#13;
schools, and 16 to private schools. The use of didactic materials and equipment is expected to&#13;
foster: (a) more active learning in classroom and beyond; (b) more cooperative classroom&#13;
work; and (c) more productive use of teachers classroom time. School principals and teachers&#13;
would have a word in selecting the didactic materials best fitting their students' needs and&#13;
interests.&#13;
3.50   Science and Technology Education. The project would: (a) provide simple science&#13;
kits to the new schools; and (b) support a study of different teaching approaches in a sample of&#13;
20 representative (urban, rural, private, public) schools (plus 20 control-group school). The&#13;
study, coordinated by the CPCU, will be conducted for two years in NTT (and East Java, see&#13;
para. 3.29) with the help of qualified specialists on science education and experienced&#13;
researchers (see para. 1.21). The hands-on approach fostered by the 'hew science" movement&#13;
would be emphasized. The results of this study would be used by MOEC to revise the teaching&#13;
of science education at JSE level and the design of the corresponding textbooks (See Annex 6&#13;
for the Terms of Reference).&#13;
Management.&#13;
3.51   Strengthening Education Management (US$1.5 million equivalent over five years,&#13;
excluding contingencies). This component would help the provincial, district, sub-district and&#13;
school administrations build implementation and managerial capacity through the design of&#13;
information systems, professional training, and provision of office equipment.&#13;
3.52   Management Training (US$1.0 million equivalent). GOI is de-concentrating the&#13;
education management by giving Kanwils and Kandep increased responsibilities over regional&#13;
and local matters and in project implementation. The project would provide managerial and&#13;
technical training to administrative staff at provincial, district, sub-district and school levels.&#13;
Training would cover about 40 staff from Kanwil, and 74 staff from the 12 Kandeps. At&#13;
Kanwil and Kandep level the emphasis would be on planning (including micro-planning),&#13;
financial analysis, and analytical capacity development for evaluation and policy purposes. At&#13;
sub-district level training would focus on education data management. At school level training&#13;
would help principal of all public, private and religious junior secondary schools enrich their&#13;
skills in supporting teachers and students, developing community participation and managing&#13;
school facilities (see Annex 7).&#13;
3.53   The development of managerial skills will be further supported by the publication of a&#13;
set of approximately ten booklets to be used as education management handbooks by teachers,&#13;
managers and supervisors on matters such as strategies of teaching-learning interaction in&#13;
classroom, the effective use of school library, test design and uses, school environment,&#13;
community involvement. For distribution to schools, Kandeps, Kanwils, Dikmenum and the&#13;
other higher instances of the administration, a total of 1,000 sets will be published.&#13;
3.54   The expected changes (in skills, processes, efficiency, general behavior and client&#13;
orientation) resulting from this professional training will be assessed with technical audits and&#13;
user satisfaction surveys covering the main stakeholders (from the parent association up to the&#13;
higher level of the administrative system).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30             East Java and N7TT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
3.55  Information Management and Utilization (US$0.5 million equivalent). The capacity&#13;
of provincial and district education administration to manage and efficiently use information&#13;
must be enhanced in light of the intended deconcentration of project implementation (see para.&#13;
1.23). Three information functions would be modemized by the project: (a) forecasting,&#13;
planning and monitoring by Kanwils and Kandeps; (b) data processing (MIS) by Dikmenum&#13;
and Kanwils; and (c) school education data management by Kandeps. The project would&#13;
provide technical assistance for the development of these functions, analytical and skill training&#13;
for administrative staff, software and equipment.&#13;

StaffAppraisal Report                            35&#13;
4.2    Bases of Cost Estimates. Baseline costs are estimated at April 1996 prices. Costs of&#13;
construction of school facilities are based on the GOI standard unit costs 2 per square meter&#13;
for such facilities and on review of costs of comparable facilities under other projects.&#13;
Equipment costs have been estimated on the basis of existing equipment lists and specifications&#13;
for new classrooms. Costs of educational materials are based on prices currently being paid for&#13;
similar items under ongoing education projects.  Costs of  domestic and intemational&#13;
consultants are in line with recent education and training projects for appropriately qualified&#13;
experts. Costs of in-country training (in-service teacher training, management training,&#13;
seminars and workshops) are derived from experiences under the ongoing secondary education&#13;
and management project and vary widely depending on the type of training being given and its&#13;
duration and location, and they are in line with the govemment guidelines. Scholarship grants&#13;
are about US$130 per scholarship-year. Operational costs are based on standard government&#13;
allowances for honoraria, travel, per diem and consumable materials.&#13;
4.3    Contingency Allowances. The project consists of a large number of items of small&#13;
monetary value. As the exact number of these items is not vital to the success of the project, no&#13;
physical contingencies have been included. A contingency allowance of US$20.9 million&#13;
equivalent represents 17 percent of the baseline costs for estimated price increases. Price&#13;
contingencies have been calculated at 8.7 percent per year for local costs and at 2.4 percent for&#13;
foreign costs.&#13;
4.4    Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$32.9 million,&#13;
representing about 22 percent of total project costs, and are based on a detailed analysis of&#13;
expenditures under similar projects in Indonesia. The foreign exchange percentages for the&#13;
major expenditure categories are estimated as follows: (a) civil works and furniture - 30&#13;
percent; (b) equipment - 70 percent; (c) international consultants - 80 percent; (d) in-country&#13;
training, domestic consultants, educational materials and operational costs - 15 percent; and (e)&#13;
scholarships and contract teachers - 0 percent.&#13;
4.5    Taxes and Duties. Taxes and duties are estimated at Rp 16.9 billion (US$7.3 million&#13;
equivalent) based on the current 10 percent value added tax on all contracts for civil works,&#13;
equipment and other goods and tax exemption of educational books. It would be financed fully&#13;
by the Government of Indonesia.&#13;
4.6    Recurrent Costs. Under the proposed project additional recurrent costs would be&#13;
generated by the recruitment of additional teachers, maintenance of new school facilities and&#13;
running of the new schools. The annual additional recurrent costs generated by these items are&#13;
estimated at Rp 7.0 billion and Rp 5.6 billion, at January 1996 prices, for East Java and NTr,&#13;
respectively, after the project is completed. These represent 1.0% and 4.7% of the education&#13;
budgets of East Java and NTT, respectively. Thus, the long-term recurrent cost implications&#13;
of the project in East Java are small and manageable, while those for NTT are much higher.&#13;
Given the much lower level of JS education enrollments in NTT compared with East Java, a&#13;
higher level of resources (relative to current regional budgetary pattems) would need to be&#13;
directed to NTT to sustain the investment.&#13;
2 GOI issues and updates annually the standard construction unit costs per square meter for every district.&#13;

B. FINANCING&#13;
4.7    The total project cost of US$146.4 million equivalent would be financed by a proposed&#13;
Bank loan of US$99.0 million equivalent, covering 71 percent of total project costs excluding&#13;
taxes (99 percent of foreign and 59 percent of local expenditures). The Government would&#13;
finance the remaining costs of US$47.4 rmillion equivalent including taxes (32 percent of total&#13;
project costs including taxes), as detailed in Table 4.3 below. The provincial budget allocation&#13;
would be done through annual provincial-level development budget.&#13;

C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.8    The procurement division of the Kanwil Office in each province would be in charge of&#13;
procurement under the general guidance of the designated project leader (Pimpro) in each&#13;
province. Whenever necessary (such as in the case of conducting ICB), the procurement&#13;
division at the provincial level could request the assistance of specialized expertise from the&#13;
MOEC Directorate for General Secondary Education (Dikmenum). The construction activities&#13;
for the proposed project would be supervised from Dikmenum by a local consulting&#13;
architect/engineer who would be hired under the Project. This person would be a technical&#13;
link between local monitors in the procurement division in each Kanwil, the CPCU in MOEC&#13;
in Jakarta and the Bank, including in particular its procurement staff in RSI. He/she would&#13;
ensure, inter alia, that the bidding procedures and contract awards are implemented in&#13;
accordance with the agreed rules and procedures. Procurement arrangements are summarized&#13;
in Table 4.4.&#13;

/a     Includes national shopping, selection of consultants following the Bank guidelines, training,&#13;
workshops, scholarships, contract teachers and operating costs, using Governrnent administrative&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.9     The loan proceeds would be used to finance procurement of works, goods and services&#13;
under all project components. All procurement of works and goods would be done in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits" (dated January 1995 and revised in January 1996) for the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38             East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
(a)    Civil Works (estimated total value US$67.8 million equivalent). Civil works&#13;
would comprise construction of new schools (six- and three-classroom),&#13;
extension of classrooms, libraries, teacher dormitories, largely in rural and&#13;
remote areas. Individual contracts for specific location, which are expected to&#13;
average about US$100,000 equivalent each, are not expected to attract foreign&#13;
bidders. Because of the large number of small size contracts in remote areas,&#13;
and the need to decentralize management of sub-projects, all works would be&#13;
contracted by national competitive bidding (NCB), advertised nationally and&#13;
following government's procedures and regulations acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Small works estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract, up&#13;
to an amount not to exceed US$25.5 million, may be awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors.&#13;
(b)   Equipment and Educational Materials (estimated total value US$14.4&#13;
million equivalent). Equipment includes, inter alia, computers and peripheral&#13;
for information management and student performance assessment, and office&#13;
equipment for provincial and district offices. Educational materials include&#13;
teaching aids for math, science, social studies, and science kits for junior&#13;
secondary schools, and development and production of booklets, videos,&#13;
posters and radio messages under the social marketing sub-component and of&#13;
handbooks/manual. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods would be&#13;
grouped in bid packages estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or more.&#13;
Educational materials and equipment packages valued at or above US$200,000&#13;
would be awarded through intemational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures,&#13;
and using the Bank's standard bidding documents for procurement of goods,&#13;
which have already been used under the ongoing Second Secondary Education&#13;
and Management Project (Ln. 31 58-IND). Locally manufactured goods would&#13;
be granted a domestic margin of preference of 15 percent of the CIF price or&#13;
the import taxes and duties which a non-exempt importer would have to pay,&#13;
whichever is lower. Contract packages valued at less than US$200,000&#13;
equivalent and up to an aggregate amount of US$4.0 million equivalent would&#13;
be awarded through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable&#13;
to the Bank. Contract packages valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent, up&#13;
to an aggregate amount of US$2.3 million equivalent, may be purchased&#13;
through national shopping on the basis of a minimum of three price quotations.&#13;
(c)    Library and Reading Books (estimated total value US$10.0 million&#13;
equivalent). In view of the wide variety of available books for school libraries&#13;
and the relatively small number of copies ordered from each book, contracts for&#13;
supply of library and reading books to the schools would be awarded on the&#13;
basis of national shopping procedures with at least three price quotations,&#13;
following govemment procedures acceptable to the Bank. Books would be&#13;
procured by the PIUs, which would inform the JSS principals of the budget&#13;
available to each school, and then consolidate the orders from the school&#13;
principals.&#13;

StaffAppraisal Report                         39&#13;
(d)   Furniture (total estimated value US$9.4 rmillion equivalent). Most furniture&#13;
contracts are not expected to exceed US$200,000 equivalent. They would be&#13;
procured through NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Fumiture contracts&#13;
costing less than US$50,000 equivalent may be purchased through national&#13;
shopping procedures with at least three price quotations up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$1.5 million equivalent.&#13;
(e)   Training (estimated total value US$14.0 million equivalent).  In-service&#13;
teacher training (PKG Model C and MGMP), management training for staff of&#13;
the Dikmenum, project provinces, districts and subdistrict, and school&#13;
principals and deputies, seminars and workshops would be organized and&#13;
contracted out in accordance with govemrnment procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, using standard forms of contract acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(f)    Scholarships (estimated total value US$16.6 million equivalent). Scholarships&#13;
would be awarded in accordance with the criteria agreed with the Bank and the&#13;
Government administrative procedures.&#13;
(g)   Contract teachers Contract teachers (estimated total value US$0.9 million&#13;
equivalent) would be selected in accordance with the procedures and criteria&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(h)   Technical Assistance (estimated total value US$3.6 million equivalent).&#13;
Domestic and intemational consultants for project implementation and&#13;
monitoring, development and production of management training and Open&#13;
SMP tutor training courses, and a science education study, would be selected&#13;
m accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants. All training&#13;
and consultancy contracts would use the Bank's standard form of contract for&#13;
consultants.&#13;
(i)    Project operating costs totaling US$1.7 million would be met following&#13;
Government adrministrative procedures, acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.10   Procurement Review. The following are the guidelines regarding procurement&#13;
review:&#13;
(a)    All contracts for works and goods valued at or over US$200,000 equivalent,&#13;
and the first three civil works contracts each in East Java and NTT would be&#13;
subject to prior review by the Bank, whereas all other contracts would be&#13;
subject to random post review.&#13;
(b)   All individual consultants' contracts valued at or over US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
and contracts with consulting firms valued at or over US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Other consultants' contracts&#13;
would be subject to random post-review. However, all terms of reference and&#13;
single-source selection of consultants would be subject to prior review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40             East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
(c)    Annual training plans for each year would be submitted to the Bank for review&#13;
and discussion. Training contracts would be subject to random post-review.&#13;
(d)   Annual implementation plans and budgets would be subject to annual reviews&#13;
and discussions between the Government and the Bank.&#13;
4.11   There would be no contract exceeding US$5 million under this project. Roughly 47&#13;
percent of civil works contracts and 36 percent of goods contracts procured under the project&#13;
are estimated to be subject to prior review. The relatively low proportion covered by prior&#13;
review is due to the large number of contracts expected to cover small amount as shown in&#13;
Annex 19; all these contracts are the responsibility of the PPIUs. The procurement consultant&#13;
will help ensure that the bidding procedures and contract awards are implemented in&#13;
accordance with the agreed rules and procedures. For contracts not covered by prior review,&#13;
post-review of such contracts would be carried out by RSI staff supported by the procurement&#13;
consultant in the CPCU. For new implementing agencies, one out of five such contracts would&#13;
be post-reviewed for the first year of implementation, followed by one out of 20 such contracts&#13;
in succeeding years (Annex 19).&#13;
D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.12  The proposed loan of US$99.0 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period of&#13;
five and one-half years (Annex 20). Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30,&#13;
2002, the Loan Closing Date. The disbursement schedule is based on the implementation&#13;
schedule and the standard disbursement profile for education projects in Indonesia.&#13;
Disbursements estimated for FY97 are based on the proposed initial deposit into the project&#13;
Special Account and replenishment. Disbursements would be made as follows:&#13;

Total        99.0&#13;
4.13   Disbursement from the loan for all contracts for civil works, equipment, educational&#13;
materials and furniture valued at or above US$200,000 equivalent per contract and consultant&#13;
firm contracts valued at or above US$100,000 equivalent and individual consultant contracts&#13;
valued at or above US$50,000 equivalent per contract would be made against full&#13;
documentation. All other disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure&#13;
procedures for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible agencies and made&#13;
available for review  as requested by visiting Bank missions.  In order to facilitate&#13;
disbursements, a Special Account in the amount up to US$5.0 million, which is based on the&#13;
need for funds to cover the expenditures on average for four months, would be established at&#13;
Bank Indonesia. This account would be maintained by the Directorate General of Budget,&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The special account would be used for all eligible foreign and local&#13;
expenditures. Replenishment applications to the Special Account will be made on a monthly&#13;
basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever comes first.&#13;
E. ACCOUNTs, AuDffs AND REPORTS&#13;
4.14   Designated government authorities would establish separate project accounts for all&#13;
project expenditures, to be maintained by each of the implementing agencies (Kanwils in East&#13;
Java and NTT, and MOEC) for their respective expenditures in accordance with sound&#13;
accounting practices. Accounts and documentation supporting the Statement of Expenditures&#13;
and Special Account would be maintained separately by DG Budget, MOF. Consolidated&#13;
project account statements would be prepared semi-annually as part of the project progress&#13;
report by CPCU in MOEC, based on the provincial project accounts statements. The&#13;
consolidated project account statements would be audited annually in accordance with Bank&#13;
guidelines, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would contain a&#13;
separate opinion by the auditors on the statement of expenditures used as a basis for&#13;
3 Operating costs include expenditures for travel, per diem, allowances and consumable materials&#13;
necessary for project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42             East Java and NIT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
disbursement. Certified copies of the consolidated project accounts statements for each fiscal&#13;
year, together with the auditor's statement, would be furnished to the Bank as soon as&#13;
available, but not later than six months after the end of each government fiscal year. At&#13;
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that the project accounts including the&#13;
special account and SOEs would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank and audit reports would be furnished to the Bank within six months of the end of the&#13;
Government 'sfiscal year (para. 7.1(e)).&#13;
4.15   The CPCU would monitor progress in project implementation and submit semi-annual&#13;
progress reports to the Bank. Within six months after the project completion, the CPCU would&#13;
submit an implementation completion report to the Bank.&#13;

5. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION&#13;
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.1   Provincial Project Implementation  Units (PPIU). The project would be&#13;
implemented by Provincial Project Implementation Units in Surabaya (East Java) and Kupang&#13;
(NTT), and would be overseen by a Central Program Coordination Unit at MOEC's&#13;
Directorate General for Secondary Education (Dikmenum) in Jakarta (see Annex 21). East&#13;
Java and NTT Kanwils would establish within their administrative structure a Provincial&#13;
Project Implementation Unit preferably headed by the provincial Director of Secondary&#13;
Education (Kabid Dikmenum), assisted by a Procurement Officer, a Disbursement Officer and&#13;
a Teacher Development Officer. The PPrU would be overseen by a Provincial Project&#13;
Advisory Committee which would be chaired by the head of MOEC provincial office&#13;
(Kakanwil), and would include the provincial directors of Secondary Education, Planning,&#13;
Procurement, and Finance, representatives of Dinas and Public Work, and a representative of&#13;
the provincial office of MORA (see Annex 22). At negotiations the Government provided&#13;
assurances that it would: (a) establish and staff the two Provincial Project Implementation&#13;
Units in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank; and (b) establish the two&#13;
Provincial Project Advisory Committees with the composition and terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, no later than November 1, 1996, and maintain them until the&#13;
completion of the project (para. 7.1(b) &amp; (c)).&#13;
5.2   The PPIU would be responsible for managing the implementation of various project&#13;
components through the services of Kanwil and Kandep sectors, and would be responsible for&#13;
preparing an annual implementation plan and budget to be submitted to the CPCU. The PPIU&#13;
would also be in charge of producing annual implementation performance reports. At the&#13;
Kandep level, implementation would be insured by a Task Force headed by the Kandep&#13;
Director (Kakandep) assisted by the heads of planning and curriculum sections.&#13;
5.3    Central Program Coordination Unit (CPCU). Dikmenum would establish within&#13;
its central structure a Central Program Coordination Unit headed by the Director of&#13;
Dikmenum, who would be assisted by a Senior Project Coordinator, an Intemational Advisor, a&#13;
Procurement Officer, a Disbursement Officer, a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, and a&#13;
project-specific Liaison Officer. The CPCU would insure that the overall and annual project&#13;
implementation plans and budgets prepared by the PPIU be in accordance with project&#13;
objectives. The CPCU would provide broad technical guidance to the PPIUs of all secondary&#13;
education projects, and would prepare the Project Implementation Handbook (see para. 5.8).&#13;
At negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would. (a) establish and staff the&#13;
Central Program Coordination Unit in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the&#13;
Bank; and (b) establish the Central Program Advisory Committee with the composition and&#13;
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, no later than November 1, 1996, and maintain&#13;
them until the completion of the project (para. 7. I (b) &amp; (c)).&#13;
5.4    A Central Program Advisory Committee would facilitate CPCU consultation and&#13;
coordination on major project implementation issues. It would include senior officials from the&#13;
MOEC, BAPPENAS, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Ministry of Home&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44             East Java and NlT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
Affairs, State Ministry for Administration Reform (MENPAN), the State Civil Service&#13;
Commission (BAKN), and the East Java and NTT Kakanwils.&#13;
5.5   Implementation Schedule. The proposed project would be implemented over a&#13;
period of five years, the completion date being December 31, 2001. The detailed schedules of&#13;
implementation of all project activities (Annex 23), costs by year and components (Annex 18)&#13;
procurement (Annex 19), and disbursement (Annex 20) would serve as the basis for project&#13;
implementation and would be updated annually by the CPCU and the PPIUs. The closing date&#13;
of the project is June 30, 2002.&#13;
5.6   Technical Assistance. A total of 1,184 person/month will be required at a cost of&#13;
US$3.1 million. In all project components, the technical assistance requirements would be&#13;
satisfied largely (95 percent) through the provision of national consultants. International&#13;
consultants (5 percent) would be recruited only in areas in which local expertise is limited or&#13;
lacking altogether. International expert assistance is designed as institution building particularly&#13;
at the province level rather than "substitutive" services directly rendered as part of project&#13;
implementation activities (see Annex 24).&#13;
5.7   Project Launch Workshop. To facilitate project start-up activities, fanilianrze PPIU&#13;
and CPCU staff and Kanwil project-associated staff with project and Bank procedures-&#13;
especially bidding documentation- and guarantee thereby an adequate and timely project&#13;
implementation, a project launch workshop of a heavily operational nature would be conducted&#13;
early during the project implementation process. This workshop has a crucial importance for&#13;
project implementation due to the province-based management structure and the incipient&#13;
experience with project-related Bank requirements at province level.&#13;
5.8   Project Implementation Handbook.  For the day-by-day practice of project&#13;
implementation CPCU, PPIU and Kandep staff will rely upon a Project Implementation&#13;
Handbook. Written in Bahasa Indonesia, the Handbook will describe in detail and in concrete&#13;
terms the methodology, procedures and multiple steps of project implementation and project&#13;
monitoring. Its content will draw mostly from the project Staff Appraisal Report and Legal&#13;
Documents, GOI and Bank procurement and disbursement guidelines, and will seek to emulate&#13;
the best practices in the country. The Handbook is expected to: (a) become the key and&#13;
uniform point of reference for all levels of project management; (b) provide users with ready&#13;
answer for problem solving; and (c) offset the relatively insufficient lack of experience with&#13;
project management at the provincial level. Dikmenum discussed an outline of the handbook&#13;
with the appraisal mission. Within the next three months a JGF consultant--in dialogue with&#13;
Dikmenum and Kanwils, other government agencies, and RSI--will help GOI prepare a draft&#13;
version to be submitted for Bank consideration on July 31, 1996, and then finalized by August&#13;
31, 1996.&#13;
B. PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
5.9    Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring of project implementation would be the&#13;
responsibility of the PPIUs at the provincial level, and of the CPCU at the central level, which&#13;
has a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer. The implementation progress of the project would&#13;
be assessed through monitoring activities and formative evaluation using the detailed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                         45&#13;
performance indicators. Additionally, outcome indicators have been identified to guide&#13;
development impact evaluation. The above indicators would also form the basis of technical&#13;
supervision by the Bank. The supervision plan is summarized in Annex 25. Data from the&#13;
detailed performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation (Annex 25) would be&#13;
incorporated in the semiannual progress reports prepared by the Govemment and subrmitted to&#13;
the Bank. At negotiations the Governement provided assurances that it would implement&#13;
policies and procedures to enable adequate project monitoring and evaluation in accordance&#13;
with agreed indicators (para. 7.  (d)).&#13;
5.10   Annual Implementation Reviews. The annual reviews would take place by October&#13;
of each project year, starting in 1997, and would: (a) analyze the previous year's performance&#13;
and budget execution against project objectives and indicators; (b) analyze the proposed work&#13;
plan and budget for the following year; (c) discuss adjustments to be made in project's&#13;
implementation schedule; and (d) analyze the results of the project evaluation. The proposed&#13;
work plan and budget for the following year would have to be previously defined at the central&#13;
and state levels and contain a detailed description of targets and planned activities. Plans for&#13;
civil works would specify type and schedule of construction and provide evidence of ownership&#13;
or donation of school or dormitory site and of adequate assignment of school teachers and staff&#13;
(see Annex 26). At negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would. (a)&#13;
prepare and present to the Bank annual progress reports on project implementation and&#13;
plans for the next year, with targets and budgets in each project component, by July 31 of&#13;
each year, starting in 1997; (b) carry out annual reviews of project implementation with the&#13;
Bank by October 31, starting with the review of the first 18 months of project implementation;&#13;
and (c) carry out annual reviews of the budgets of project provinces to evaluate use of the&#13;
previous year's budget as a basis for preparing the DIP for the following year (para. 7. If&#13;
(g) &amp; (h))-&#13;
5.11   Mid-term  Review.   A comprehensive mid-term review would be conducted in&#13;
October 1999 to assess project performance and initial impact in light of project objectives and&#13;
expressed in project indicators and Govemment policies in addition to review activities&#13;
normally covered under annual implementation reviews (see Annex 26). The mid-term review&#13;
would have a strong focus on the formulation and carrying out of sectoral policies, particularly&#13;
for institutional strengthening at both province and district levels, and on redefining the&#13;
component or element where major problems were positively identified. The PPIUs and the&#13;
CPCU would be responsible for hiring consultants and preparing the final terms of reference&#13;
for the mid-term review, based on experience accumulated under the project and the final or&#13;
preliminary results of studies, satisfactory to the Bank, and for preparing the report with&#13;
recommendations. At negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would&#13;
prepare and present to the Bank a mid-term report on project implementation and plans for&#13;
the remaining years of the project, by July 31, 1999; and review the report together with the&#13;
Bank by October 31, 1999 (para. 7. 1j)).&#13;
5.12   Technical Audits. Dikmenum has the overall responsibility to monitor all project&#13;
activities and routine monitoring would be done through annual reviews. However, because a&#13;
large number of contracts would be financed under SOE procedures, an independent, qualified&#13;
firm with extemal technical assistance would be hired to conduct technical audits of key project&#13;
activities. The audits would cover activities in progress and post reviews of completed actions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46              East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
to examine whether implementation of the various project components are technically&#13;
appropriate and to recommend corrective measures if necessary (see Annex 27). At&#13;
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that technical audits would be carried out&#13;
every year during the implementation of the project in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
and in a manner acceptable to the Bank, and that copies of the technical audit reports will be&#13;
furnished to the Bank for comments no later than three months after the end of the Fiscal&#13;
Year (para. 7.10).&#13;
5.13   Completion Report. A project implementation completion report is due no later than&#13;
six months after the Closing Date of the loan or such later date as may be agreed for this&#13;
purpose between the Borrower and the Bank. The report to be compiled by MOEC is&#13;
expected to provide a critical overview of project inputs, processes and outcomes. More&#13;
precisely the completion report will summarize (a) project results and impact on the basis of&#13;
indicators; (b) key project activities and management; (c) institutional lessons learned from&#13;
project implementation; (d) the project's financial status; (e) implementation issues and&#13;
recommendations; and (f) the plan designed to ensure the continued achievement of the&#13;
objectives of the project. At negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would&#13;
furnish to the Bank within six months after the project closing date a plan designed to ensure&#13;
the continued effectiveness of the project objectives (para. 7. 1 (k)).&#13;

6. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. EXPECTED BENEFITS&#13;
6.1   The benefits of the proposed project derive from meeting the high demand for junior&#13;
secondary education where it exists and stimulating demand where it may be constrained due&#13;
to low income and/or credit market failures. The expected outcomes of the investment are: (a)&#13;
increased numbers of higher quality junior secondary graduates; (b) more students at higher&#13;
levels of education as approximately 80 percent of junior secondary graduates proceed to&#13;
senior secondary education and another 30 percent continue to tertiary education; (c) poverty&#13;
reduction and greater distribution gains in the economy as a result of focused junior secondary&#13;
education improvement for low income and rural students; (d) externalities derived from girls'&#13;
education such as lower fertility, increased prenatal care utilization, their families' improved&#13;
health and nutrition status and children's higher educational attainment; (e) greater professional&#13;
qualification of teaching and managerial staff; and (f) better quality data on students' and&#13;
schools' performance for the decision-making process. More specifically, the project will have&#13;
a positive impact on women and the poor, which is detailed in para. 3.16-3.17.&#13;
6.2    Outcomes (a) and (b) above are generated as a result of the increased access and&#13;
enhanced quality that the project investment will ensure. The table below presents the stream of&#13;
beneficiaries as a result of access and quality interventions over the next ten years (see Annex&#13;
1, Section IV for details).&#13;

B. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
6.3   The proposed project is expected to positively affect the environment through greater&#13;
emphasis on environmental concems in teacher training activities, the content of reading,&#13;
supplementary and reference books, and the development of a science education approach&#13;
more closely linked to daily life interests. This blend of curricular inputs would very likely&#13;
generate in the young learners and future citizens the necessary awareness of, and commitment&#13;
to, environmental issues. The project would have no direct environmental effects and is&#13;
classified as a Category C project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48              East Java and N7T Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
C. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
6.4    Project sustainability hinges on financial and institutional conditions that already exist&#13;
in the system and will be strengthened over the five-year project. The financial conditions&#13;
needed to keep teachers in classroom, schools well kept and the scholarship program for the&#13;
poorest children are existing programs that will be expanded under the project and will rely on&#13;
increasing budget resources for basic education. The system is expected to become more&#13;
efficient with the efficiency-and productivity-oriented elements sponsored by the project The&#13;
institutional conditions involve both the strategy for the development of the nine-year basic&#13;
education system, and the improvement of management structure and skills. With the local&#13;
ownership and managerial skills supported under the project, the system is expected to&#13;
incorporate the required capacity and motivation to maximize the use of available resources&#13;
and yield at least the same results as the project itself Fiscal sustainability in the two provinces&#13;
is analyzed below.&#13;
6.5    East Java. Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for East Java&#13;
(including physical and price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$103.1 million, would&#13;
account for about 6 percent of the East Java education budget, on average, during the project&#13;
period (1996/97-2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first&#13;
two years of the project increase from US$0.2 million in 1998/99 to US$2.4 million in the last&#13;
year of the project, and stabilize at US$3.1 million after the project is completed, representing&#13;
1.0 percent of the education budget. Thus the long-term recurrent cost implications of the&#13;
project are small and manageable.&#13;
6.6    NTT. Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for NTT (including physical&#13;
and price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$49 million, would account for about 18&#13;
percent of the NTT education budget, on average, during the project period (1996/97-&#13;
2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first two years of the&#13;
project increase from US$0.2 million in 1998/99 to US$1.9 million in the last year of the&#13;
project, and stabilize at US$2.5 million after the project is completed, representing 4.7 percent&#13;
of the education budget.  The recurrent cost implications of the project in NTT are&#13;
approximately 4 times higher than that for East Java. Given the much lower level of JSE&#13;
enrollments in NTT compared to East Java, a higher level of resource (relative to current&#13;
regional budgetary patterns) need to be directed to NTT to sustain the investment.&#13;
D. RISKS&#13;
6.7    The main risks associated with the proposed project are:&#13;
(a)    Private sector participation in junior secondary may decline in absolute or&#13;
relative terms which would have significant budgetary implications for the&#13;
public sector. If the share of the private sector in JSE enrollment declines but&#13;
remains at its current absolute level of about 328,000 students in East Java and&#13;
40,000 in NTT (which means a decline in relative share from the current 40&#13;
percent to about 20 percent), the budgetary shortfall in the next five years (see&#13;
para. 1.8) would be twice the shortfall if the private sector retains its 40 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                           49&#13;
share (see Annex 1, Section II for details). Furthermore, if private enrollment is&#13;
phased out (except for enrollment in religious schools), the budgetary shortfall&#13;
in the next five years would be three times the level of shortfall if the private&#13;
sector continues its significant role. The risk of the decline in the private sector&#13;
participation is partly mitigated by the involvement of project advisory&#13;
committees at CPCU and PPIUs, with the participation of the MOEC&#13;
Directorate for private education.&#13;
(b)    The quality improvement component of the project may prove to be costlier&#13;
and to take longer than initially planned, thus postponing or reducing its&#13;
expected benefits. The risks from the labor market side lie in not rewarding&#13;
higher quality graduates with a sufficiently high wage premium to generate the&#13;
estimated economic rate of return of the quality component of the project: the&#13;
base case estimate of the economic rate of return assumes that higher quality&#13;
graduates will reap a 15 percent additional wage premium in the labor market.&#13;
This generates a rate of return to quality of 22 percent in NTT and 17 percent&#13;
in East Java (see Annex I, Section IV). Sensitivity analysis indicates that a 10&#13;
percent (versus 15 percent) quality wage premium will reduce the rate of&#13;
return to 12 percent in East Java and 17 percent in NTT.&#13;
(c)    Implementation by PPRUs in the provincial and district offices operating in an&#13;
institutional environment still in transition to less centralized procedures. The&#13;
question is about the possibility of locally managing a centrally allocated&#13;
project when all incentive systems, particularly in personnel management, are&#13;
under central control.&#13;
(d)    The insufficient implementation experience available at the provincial and&#13;
district offices to manage all the aspects of the project implementation process&#13;
without previous experience with Bank requirements and procedures.&#13;
6.8    The proposed project intends to reduce the risks of:&#13;
(a)    private decline by reinforcing the mechanisms for school mapping in East Java&#13;
and NTT, so as to avoid construction of public schools in the catchment area of&#13;
an existing private school, and by providing support to private schools (teacher&#13;
training, library books and teaching aids) to improve their role in the system&#13;
and including the Directorate of Private Education in the Central Program&#13;
Advisory Committee (see para. 5.4);&#13;
(b)    slower quality improvement by using training programs which have already a&#13;
long, positive track-record and supporting further improvement of these&#13;
programs (such as PKG and MGMP for teacher training and the MOEC&#13;
program for student performance assessment); providing the PPIUs with&#13;
detailed terms of reference (Science and Technology Education Study);&#13;
(c)    ongoing deconcentration by confirming assurances from the Govemment that&#13;
it is committed towards the deconcentration of responsibilities, and that it will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50             East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
set up: (a) two Provincial Project Implementation Units -PPIU- (one in East&#13;
Java and another in NTT) to manage the project at provincial level in&#13;
coordination with Kandeps (district offices); and (b) a Central Progran&#13;
Coordination Unit -CPCU- designed to provide technical assistance and carry&#13;
out assessment.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAM&#13;
AND PROJECT&#13;
The economic analysis conducted for the East Java Secondary Education Project&#13;
consists of: (i) demand analysis and rationale for public investment in junior secondary; (ii)&#13;
fiscal analysis; (iii) analysis of alternatives; and (iv) cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
The economic analysis first aims to understand the determinants of demand for junior&#13;
secondary education in Indonesia particularly since there have been variations in the past&#13;
decade and there are significant disparities among socio-economic groups (Section I). This&#13;
section establishes that the main determinants of demand are household incomes, costs of&#13;
schooling and distance to school; the latter two are variables that Government can affect&#13;
through this project. The rationale for additional public investment in junior secondary is&#13;
investigated subsequently (Section 1), and it is argued that on both efficiency and equity&#13;
grounds, there are justifications for additional public intervention in expanding junior&#13;
secondary.&#13;
The cost implications of the Government's expansion program (Section II) are then&#13;
considered. A key element is the future role of the private sector in the provision of junior&#13;
secondary education. The conclusions reached are that a sizable budgetary effort will be&#13;
required, but that the policy is attainable if the economy continues to grow at its historical&#13;
rate, additional funds are made available to junior secondary including external borrowing&#13;
and the private sector retains its current large share.&#13;
The next question that arises is how best to provide junior secondary education. The&#13;
Government has at its reach both demand and supply policy instruments and within the latter&#13;
several alternative modes of junior secondary exist. These are analyzed in Section 111.&#13;
Finally, the costs and benefits of the specific project design are laid out and an&#13;
economic rate of return is calculated (Section IV). The financial impact of the project on the&#13;
provincial budgets and prospects of sustainability is analyzed in Section II.&#13;

I. DEMAND ANALYSIS AND RATIONALE FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN JUNIOR SECONDARY&#13;
Enrollment at the junior secondary level expanded rapidly between the late 1960's&#13;
and 1980's, reaching 63 percent in gross terms in 1988 (47 percent NER).1 For the next five&#13;
years, however, enrollment fell to 52 percent (41 percent NER) by 1993 (declining in&#13;
absolute terms from 7.8 million to 7.1 million students). Recent data indicate a resurgence of&#13;
demand in the last two years (GER and NER rose to 58 percent and 47 percent respectively&#13;
by 1995) almost restoring the pre-decline enrollment rates.&#13;
There remain significant differences in enrollments, however, among income groups&#13;
and urban-rural residents. In 1994, the net enrollment rate among the top quintile was 66&#13;
percent compared to 25 percent for the lowest quintile.2 Significant differences also exist&#13;
among urban and rural enrollment rates: 62 percent of urban children aged 13-15 years old&#13;
are in junior secondary, compared to 33 percent of rural children. When decomposed by&#13;
income and urban-rural levels, enrollments are low for the poor and near-poor children in&#13;
both rural and urban areas, and the middle income rural children.3&#13;
High direct costs are one of the primary factors explaining the low junior secondary&#13;
enrollment rates among the poor and near-poor. Overall, the cost to families of educating a&#13;
child in junior secondary comes to an annual average of Rp210,000 (1994). This is more than&#13;
two-and-a-half times the cost of primary education (an average Rp8O,000).4 For households&#13;
in the lowest quintile, total expenditure per junior secondary student is equivalent to&#13;
approximately 80 percent of per capita household expenditure. Particularly significant are the&#13;
up-front registration (entrance) fees that parents must pay: in 1994, the average entrance fee&#13;
for junior secondary was Rp47,500, which for those in the two lower quintiles was five times&#13;
more than the registration fee paid for primary education.&#13;
Indirect (opportunity) costs of junior secondary education are significant in rural&#13;
areas, and this exacerbates the effect of high direct costs especially among the poor. Schools&#13;
are in short supply in rural areas which imposes high travel time and costs. The longer the&#13;
travel time, the higher the opportunity cost of schooling, and the more reluctant parents will&#13;
be to send their children to school. Though the difference between average travel time to&#13;
primary school for urban versus rural residents is insignificant, the national average travel&#13;
time to junior secondary schools in rural areas is 50 percent higher than in urban areas.5&#13;
Earnings foregone while attending school can also be significant among the poor.&#13;
Parents' decisions to send a child to junior secondary education depends on the&#13;
aforementioned costs and also on:&#13;

Calendar year (i.e. 1988) in this note refers to school year (i.e. 1987/88) in the enrollment statistics.&#13;

Education Data, RAND (October 1995)&#13;

5 Ibid. Since travel times are reported by parents whose children are enrolled in school, they are likely to&#13;
underestimate the travel time families face when making a decision regarding whether or not to enroll their&#13;
child. The survey reports average travel time in rural areas of 30 minutes versus 19 for urban areas.&#13;

Annex 1: Page 3 of 18                                5&#13;
1)    income constraints and credit markets failure. The poor have not only low income but&#13;
also greater difficulty to borrow. Particularly in the area of human capital investments, the&#13;
possibility of borrowing is practically non-existent even among better off families. This&#13;
implies that private demand for junior secondary and, as a result, current enrollment, is lower&#13;
than its social optimum.&#13;
2)     t  b                se        e    _. A tangible benefit associated with junior&#13;
secondary education is the additional labor income that would accrue to the graduate&#13;
compared to someone who left school after completion of primary education. Under normal&#13;
(steady-state) conditions, the wage differentials between primary and junior secondary&#13;
education should reflect the socially optimum amounts of education in the labor force&#13;
rendering corrective action by the government unnecessary. However, Indonesia is in a state&#13;
of rapid transition. Examining the behavior of the labor market, a conclusion that emerges is&#13;
that formal sector employment is growing relatively slowly (compared to education output)&#13;
and wage differentials have been compressed (due to fast growth in enrollment among the&#13;
better off).6 These patterns give the short-term but false "signal" to poor families that junior&#13;
secondary education has neither direct wage rewards nor significant employment prospects&#13;
outside agriculture or the informal sector. Indeed, in the period 1988 to 1991 even absolute&#13;
enrollments in junior secondary education declined. This disequilibrium phenomena works&#13;
against long-term investments, such as those in human capital, and justify Government&#13;
support to stabilize short-run variations and to steadily increase junior secondary enrollments.&#13;
3)     how farsighted parents are. Parents are making decisions today in light of the fact that&#13;
jobs in the formal sector are expanding at a lower pace than education (hence the&#13;
aforementioned wage compression and also the higher rates of unemployment among the&#13;
educated). However, as the economy approaches the turning point (expected to take place&#13;
within the decade) and as has happened in other NICs, the transformation of the economy&#13;
from an agrarian one to one that relies heavily on the education and productivity of its&#13;
workers would be fast. At that point, corrective action in the form of training is typically&#13;
expensive. For example, it is estimated that training requires six times the costs of basic&#13;
7&#13;
education in order to achieve the same effect on productivity and wages.&#13;
4)    the prospects of continuing to senior secondary. Since junior secondary education is&#13;
the stepping stone for proceeding to senior secondary (and tertiary) education, families can&#13;
give consideration to the costs and benefits of completing senior secondary education. The&#13;
cost of senior secondary is more than double that of junior secondary (Rp460,000 per year)&#13;
and may in turn deter parents from investing in junior secondary. Also, as with the earnings&#13;
of junior secondary graduates, the wage premium of senior secondary education has declined&#13;
significantly over time.&#13;
6 See Training and the Labor Market in Indonesia: Policies for Productivity Gains and Employment Growth,&#13;
World Bank (1996) Chapter 1. The wage premium for urban junior secondary graduates relative to primary&#13;
have declined over the past decade (while still positive) from 80 percent to 30 percent for males and 166&#13;
percent to 60 percent for females. (Ibid.)&#13;

In short, enrollments in junior secondary education can increase if direct costs of&#13;
education are reduced (such as through scholarships, fee reductions, etc.) and if indirect costs&#13;
are alleviated (e.g. through more and better geographical distribution of schools). On the&#13;
benefit side, though little can usually be done with the respect to how the relative supply and&#13;
demand of educated/less educated workers operate in the labor market, there are policies that&#13;
increase the value of education through improving its quality. Quality also affects the&#13;
decision of parents to enroll their children and a child's progress through school. There are&#13;
improvements to be made on the input aspects of quality, for example, 30 percent of junior&#13;
secondary students still do not have mathematics textbooks. But the more important (and&#13;
complex) area of improvement appears to be in the process of how inputs are combined to&#13;
educate students and the interactions between teachers and students. Evidence on this for&#13;
junior secondary in Indonesia is scant, but findings from research conducted in primary&#13;
schools indicates that the problem may lie in the teacher's inability to identify, diagnose and&#13;
address student progress in the classroom.8 Another indicator of quality is the relative low&#13;
scores in reading competency tests of Indonesian students by international standards.&#13;
Externalities. Research from other countries has pointed to the existence of positive&#13;
extemaliis such as reduced fertility and child mortality and improved nutritional status that&#13;
correlate with female secondary education.9 For Indonesia, survey results indicate that a&#13;
mother's education is an important determinant of prenatal care utilization: 25 percent of&#13;
women with some primary education do not use prenatal care compared to less than 10&#13;
percent of women with junior secondary education.10 Furthermore, analysis of nutritional&#13;
status in Indonesia finds a strong effect of maternal education on children's nutritional status:&#13;
for women with between zero and five years of education, an additional year of education has&#13;
no impact on the child's nutritional status, while, among women with six to twelve years of&#13;
education (or more), an additional year of education improves nutritional status&#13;
significantly. 11&#13;
The four reasons given earlier on why private considerations may lead to a social&#13;
underinvestment in junior secondary and the externalities from women's education all point&#13;
to the need for greater public involvement. Though we do not quantify the extent of market&#13;
failure associated with these reasons (e.g., does credit market failure affect 10 or 10,000 poor&#13;
children) some additional insight may be gained by looking at social rates of return to&#13;
education that have been computed from 1986-1992. The estimates indicate that returns to&#13;
junior secondary education are the highest among other education subsectors (Table 1).&#13;
Furthermore, while returns for all the subsectors may have declined during this period, those&#13;
for junior secondary saw the smallest reduction.&#13;
8 'Some Basic Number Skills in Twelve Primary Schools: An Exploratory Study', Tony Somerset (1995)&#13;
9 Subbarao and Raney (1993) examine the determinants of desired family size in 72 countries and find that&#13;
after controlling for level of economic development and other factors, female secondary education is highly&#13;
significant. Secondary education for females reduces fertility and mortality in several ways: (i) by enhancing&#13;
the opportunity cost of a woman's time in economic activities relative to child-bearing; (ii) by promoting child&#13;
health which in turn affects desired family size; and (iii) by promoting more effective contraceptive use and&#13;
willingness to use modern contraceptive methods.&#13;

In conclusion, there are both efficiency and equity grounds for public intervention in&#13;
junior secondary education. The appropriate public interventions include building school&#13;
facilities in rural areas, providing scholarships to poor students, and enhancing quality.&#13;

II. FISCAL ANALYSIS&#13;
An analysis of the likely costs and implications for the public budget of achieving&#13;
universal enrollment in junior secondary education by the year 2010 is presented below. Te&#13;
fiscal impact of this project is then estimated.&#13;
A. Fiscal Implications of the Junior Secondary Education Expansion Program&#13;
The overall education expenditure in Indonesia is currently reasonably balanced&#13;
across primary (46%), secondary (13% junior, 15% senior) and tertiary (13%) levels.&#13;
However, it has been subject to significant variations in the past and has not always been&#13;
protected from budgetary cuts. Indeed, public expenditure on education has declined over&#13;
time as the graphs below demonstrate.'2 This is relevant in light ofthe Government's plans to&#13;
achieve universal nine years of education, which will require significant additional public&#13;
resources to be spent on the junior secondary sub-sector, as well as on primary education.'3&#13;

Achieving universal junior secondary enrollment in 15 years is a formidable task as it&#13;
requires increasing enrollments by 1.8 times (from 7.5 million to 13.5 million). It is therefore&#13;
important to define the role of the public and private sectors. Currently, the ratio of&#13;
public/private enrollment is about 60/40. We evaluate the cost implications of three&#13;
alternative public/private scenarios, that is, universal junior secondary enrollment is achieved&#13;
in year 2010 and:&#13;
1)     the public/private share stays at its current 60/40 ratio;&#13;
2)      private enrollment stays at its current 3.5 million/year; or&#13;
3)      private enrollment is phased out except for enrollment in religious schools which&#13;
is assumed to remain at its current level of I million students/year.&#13;
Under the 60/40 public/private scenario, enrollments in public schools are assumed to&#13;
increase annually by 240,000 students. Under the other two scenarios the annual increase will&#13;
12 The last two years are preliminary estimates.&#13;
13 The exercise conducted here assumes that the graduation rate from primary school will increase from the current&#13;
rate of 75% to 100%. This will require additional investments at the primary level to increase retention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Page 7 of 18                            59&#13;
be 400,000 and 533,000 students. In all scenarios it is assumed that the level of recurrent&#13;
funding remains at its present level of $110 per student/year which implies that there would&#13;
be no quality gains. Development costs (building new schools) are estimated to be around&#13;
$900 per additional student. To address credit market failures and enable expansion among&#13;
the poor, it is assumed that 10 percent of additional students in excess of the current 7.5&#13;
million will receive a scholarship of $90/year. Students enrolled in private schools are&#13;
assumed to receive an average annual subsidy of $40 per student to help raise the quality of&#13;
private schools (Appendix Table B).&#13;
The results of the scenarios indicate that achieving universal basic education will&#13;
have sizable budgetary implications. Even if the current public/private ratio of 60/40 is&#13;
preserved, this would imply that public enrollment increases from 4.5 million to 8.1 million.&#13;
What is required to finance this expansion (which is desirable on both efficiency and equity&#13;
grounds) is a combination of significantly increased allocations to junior secondary&#13;
education, a decline in the funding of other education sub-sectors (such as senior secondary&#13;
or tertiary education) unless there is an increase in the overall education budget (if&#13;
sectoral allocations are to be preserved, especially with respect to primary education), and&#13;
large funding from donors.&#13;
The estimates below indicate that under all scenarios a significant financing effort&#13;
will be required (Table 2). In addition, the difference in enrollments between the three&#13;
scenarios point to a substantial increase in total public costs if the private sector ceases to&#13;
play the role it does today. More specifically, the total additional public funds that would be&#13;
required through year 2010 come to about: $7.6 billion in the public/private scenario; $1 1.1&#13;
billion if the current level of private enrollment is maintained; and $14.5 billion under the&#13;
pure public scenario (if the private sector is phased out except for religious schools).&#13;

How can the expansion be financed? Let us assume that the education budget&#13;
increases annually by 6 percent, that is, as much as the historic growth rate of GDP. This will&#13;
add nearly $7.5 billion to the junior secondary education budget. Compared to the additional&#13;
public funds required for the expansion, this implies a shortfall of $543,000, $4 million and&#13;
$7.4 million under the three scenarios (Table 3). The last two scenarios appear unattainable,&#13;
but the (60/40) public/private scenario also has a caveat: it is heavily front loaded. More&#13;
precisely, additional funding comes to $1.2 billion in the first ten years though no additional&#13;
resources will be required thereafter when the system reaches relative maturity (after year&#13;
2005 the percentage increases in public enrollments will be significantly less than 6 percent&#13;
growth in the budget). The (60/40) public/private scenario though affordable at face value,&#13;
will require additional funding of an average $120 million during the first ten years of&#13;
expansion (and considerably more, as much as $150-$200 million in the first five years). The&#13;
budgetary shortfall (in $ million) is shown graphically in Figure 3.&#13;

The three scenarios would require that the budgetary allocation to junior secondary&#13;
education increase from the current 13 percent of the education budget to approximately 16&#13;
percent, 19 percent and 21 percent in the next few years (and in the case of the mainly public&#13;
scenario it will have to remain at more than 16 percent in the steady-state compared to the&#13;
public/private scenario where the share stabilizes at 11 percent) (Table 4). These figures&#13;
amount respectively to increases of 23, 46 and 62 percent of the current allocation.&#13;

The cost estimates presented above incorporate estimates of scholarships for poor&#13;
students and subsidies paid to private schools. It is legitimate to plan for such public&#13;
expenditure because alleviating supply constraints (e.g., building schools in rural areas) will&#13;
not alone remove demand constraints (that is, the opportunity cost of attending education).&#13;
Assuming that the poorest 10 percent of the additional enrollment each year receives a&#13;
scholarship of $)O, the total cost of the scheme over the 15 year period will come to an&#13;
annual average of $29 million in all scenarios (increasing from $3.6 million in 1996 to $54&#13;
million in 2C 0). In the public/private scenario, scholarships will amount to 6 percent of the&#13;
total public cost of expansion (ranging from 1.4 percent in 1996 to 7 percent in 2010). On the&#13;
other hand, the budgetary savings from phasing out private schlools and the subsidy they&#13;
receive (assumed at $40/student) will be only $1.6 million/year. This saving is small (I&#13;
percent of the additional funds) and can prove counterproductive as it will take place at the&#13;
expense of the current co-financing of junior secondary education between Government and&#13;
families.&#13;
What do these estimates imply for the total public budget allocated to education&#13;
relative to GDP? Public expenditure on education is today approximately 2.7 percent of&#13;
GDP. To fund the expected expansion of junior secondary education this figure should&#13;
increase to approximately 3.0 percent and 3.2 percent under the 60/40 public/private and pure&#13;
public scenarios, respectively. These figures assume that allocations to other sectors increase&#13;
annually by 6 percent (GDP growth).&#13;
In conclusion, achieving universal enrollment in junior secondary is desirable on both&#13;
equity and efficiency grounds, but will require a sizable budgetary effort. The policy is&#13;
attainable if the economy continues to grow at its historical rate, additional funds are made&#13;
available to junior secondary including external borrowing, and the private sector retains its&#13;
share.&#13;
B. Fiscal Impact of the Project&#13;
Utilizing the results of the above scenarios and assuming the 60/40 public/private&#13;
case as the "desirable" scenario, the fiscal impact of the project on the two provinces is&#13;
estimated below. The estimates are based on the following assumptions: (i) the education&#13;
budget in each province will increase at the national historical growth rate of GDP (6% per&#13;
annum in real terms); and (ii) the share of the junior secondary education budget out of the&#13;
total provincial education budget would also have to increase during the capital-intensive&#13;
phase (as in the national scenario; see Table 4 above).&#13;
East Java: Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for East Java&#13;
(including physical and price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$101.5 million, would&#13;
account for about 6% of the East Java education budget, on average, during the project period&#13;
(1996/97-2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first two&#13;
years of the project increase from US$0.2 million in 1998/99 to US$2.4 million in the last&#13;
year of the project, and stabilize at US$3.1 million after the project is completed, representing&#13;
1.0% of the education budget. Thus the long-term recurrent cost implications of the project&#13;
are small and manageable.&#13;

NTT: Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for NTT (including&#13;

about 18% of the NTT education budget, on average, during the project period (1996/97-&#13;
2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first two years of&#13;
the project increase from US$0.2 million in 1998/99 to US$1.9 million in the last year of the&#13;
project, and stabilize at US$2.5 million after the project is completed, representing 4.7% of&#13;
the education budget. The recurrent cost implications of the project in NIT are&#13;
approximately (4 times) higher than thatfor East .Java. Given the much lower level of JS&#13;
education enrollmerits in NTT compared to East Java, a higher level of resources (relative to&#13;
current regional budgetarY patterns) need to be directed to NTT to sustain the investment.&#13;

III. NALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES&#13;
A. Alternative Modes of Junior Secondary Education&#13;
GOI has available to it various alternatives to the regular (9 classroom) SMP school.&#13;
These include: SMP Kecil (small schools of 3 classrooms), SMP Terbuka (open/distance&#13;
school), and Paket B (non-formal education). An analysis of their unit costs and effectiveness&#13;
is presented below. Two words of caution are in order, however: (i) the alternative programs&#13;
are not perfect substitutes for each other or even to the regular SMP (see below); and (ii) the&#13;
programs are in an early stage of development, particularly the SMP Terbuka and are&#13;
undergoing continuous revisions, hence their unit costs and outcomes are expected to change&#13;
over time. The analysis below, therefore, is preliminary and will be updated during the course&#13;
of the project.&#13;
Following is a characterization of the main advantages and disadvantages of each&#13;
program:&#13;
Program                     Advantages                        Disadvantages&#13;
*   Better learning environment.   *   Higher investment cost than for&#13;
*   More time-on-task in school.       other options.&#13;
*   Preferred by community because  *   Often required students to walk&#13;
it represents regular schooling.   long distances&#13;
*   Employs unprepared multi-&#13;
SMP Kecil                                                subject teachers.&#13;
*  Might require student or teacher&#13;
accommodations&#13;
*   Is not free-of-charge (parents&#13;
have to pay for entrance fees,&#13;
uniforms, exam fees, BP3, etc.)&#13;
*  Free of charge.                 *   Requires a regular SMP as a&#13;
*   More flexible time.                basis (mother school).&#13;
*   At end of course, students take    *  Less time-on-task at school.&#13;
SMP Terbuka            EBTANAS exam.                   *   Students have to travel to mother&#13;
*   Uses regular teachers.             school&#13;
*  All curriculum subjects are     *   Requires discipline of self-study.&#13;

*   Free of charge.                *   Is less accepted by community.&#13;
*   Reaches students who work      *   Students do not take final&#13;

*   Has modules of better quality      one not comparable to NEM&#13;
than those of SMP Terbuka.         scores.&#13;
*   Good access for females.       *  Requires self-study.&#13;
Paket B         *  On average, students walk only I  *  Tutors are very often not&#13;
km to tutorial center.             teachers.&#13;
*   Is more suitable for participants   *  Not all subjects are taught.&#13;

Following are estimates of unit costs of each alternative program:&#13;
Unit Cost              Unit Cost&#13;
Program                   (Rp. per student p.a.)    (Rp. per student p.a.)&#13;
(with books/modules)   (without books/modules)&#13;
SMP Kecil 1/                   467,000                 133,000&#13;
SMP Terbuka                    360,000                 100,000&#13;
Paket B                        305,000                  45,000&#13;
1/ including amortization of building&#13;
As mentioned above, the three alternatives are not perfect substitutes. SMP Terbuka&#13;
needs a 9-classroom regular SMP school within reasonable distance to function as a mother&#13;
school, providing subject matter teachers. Thus the program cannot be introduced in very&#13;
remote areas where regular SMPs are not available. Paket B is more flexible, but does not&#13;
lead to an EBTANAS examination yet; thus it is not well accepted in all areas. An SMP kecil,&#13;
always accepted despite some of the draw-backs in terms of teachers' quality, requires a&#13;
capital investment (and subsequent maintenance and amortization). In addition, MOEC has to&#13;
find regular teachers willing to stay in remote areas.&#13;
LearningAchievement It is difficult at present to compare learning achievement&#13;
between the three types of schooling. SMP Terbuka is a very recent program; NEM scores&#13;
exist for only one year, thus there is limited basis for analysis. Paket B has its own&#13;
examination which does not produce any NEM scores; its examination scores are not&#13;
comparable with those of the other two programs. So far, only one comparative study of&#13;
learning achievements has been conducted.14 Students in the sample, subdivided into two&#13;
groups according to whether they had just entered the program (Group I) or they had attended&#13;
the program for one year (Group II), were administered the same test, which gave the&#13;
following mean test results:&#13;
Program                      Group I          Group II&#13;
Paket B                         34.0              41.0&#13;
Regular SMP                     42.5              51.3&#13;
SMP Terbuka                     31.1             34.3&#13;
Students of SMP Terbuka scored the lowest grades. The study further calculates the "gain&#13;
points average" for each alternative, which shows that the highest gain was obtained by the&#13;
regular SMP, followed by Paket B and SMP Terbuka.&#13;
The above mentioned study represents one case study and should not be considered as&#13;
conclusive. As the three alternative programs are further developed under the project (and&#13;
other projects such as the Non-formal Education Project), they will be monitored and&#13;
outcomes measured in order to produce more conclusive conclusions.&#13;

B. Public versus Private Provision of Junior Secondary Education&#13;
A second analysis of alternatives is that covered under Section 11 on the role of the&#13;
private sector. The earlier discussion highlighted the budgetary implications of the expansion&#13;
program if the role of the private sector declines. There are additional merits to preserving the&#13;
private sector. First, given the current and projected surplus of teachers, a robust private&#13;
sector is an effective means for helping to clear the market for teachers. Second, madrasah&#13;
schools (religious schools which currently enroll about 20% of junior secondary students)&#13;
offer access to junior secondary in small, poor communities and at a cost that is significantly&#13;
lower than even MOEC-supervised private schools. These schools also enroll a higher&#13;
proportion of girls than boys, reflecting the preference pattern of some families for non-&#13;
conventional education. Third, maintaining the share of private schools at the junior&#13;
secondary level establishes the basis for sustaining the even larger share of private schools at&#13;
the senior secondary level (54% of enrollments in 1993/94).&#13;

IV. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS&#13;
The economic rate of return for the project investment is estimated by&#13;
province and component (increasing access and enhancing quality, but excluding the&#13;
management component). The estimates are obtained by solving for the internal rate of return&#13;
that equates a stream of benefits and costs resulting from the investment over a thirty year&#13;
horizon.&#13;
Table I presents the rates of return for the two project provinces by component.&#13;
Overall returns for the two provinces are high and those to quality enhancements are higher&#13;
than for expansion of access, particularly in the case of NTT.&#13;
Table 1&#13;
Rates of Return to Project Investments by Component and Province&#13;
Component         East Java        NTT&#13;
Access               16.3           14.0&#13;
fQuality             21.8           22.0&#13;
Total                18.3           16.0&#13;
The remainder of the section explains how the estimates were made and provides an&#13;
indication of the sensitivity of the estimates to some of the underlying assumptions.&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
Increasing Access.   The project investments are expected to lead to an increase in&#13;
the number of students enrolled in and graduating from junior secondary in any given year.&#13;
Most junior secondary graduates, however, do not stop at this level: nationally about 84&#13;
percent proceed to senior secondary and another 30 percent proceed to tertiary. Thus, the&#13;
stream of output resulting from the project investments is modeled as a function of the&#13;
following five levels of outflows:&#13;
1. Junior secondary graduates;&#13;
2. Junior secondary graduates who proceed to senior secondary and then drop out;&#13;
3. Junior secondary graduates who succeed in graduating from senior secondary;&#13;
4. Senior secondary graduates who proceed to university and then drop out; and&#13;
5. University graduates.&#13;
The total number of the above outflow over a thirty year period amounts to&#13;
approximately 945,000 beneficiaries (Table 2).15 The benefits of each of the beneficiaries are&#13;
estimated as the difference in wages between one level of education and the next. No&#13;
additional wage premiums are assumed to accrue to dropouts (they earn the same wage as&#13;
15 These outflows assume that there will not be a capacity constraint at the senior secondary and higher education&#13;
levels. Give the rapid growth of the private sector at these levels in the past decade, this assumption is not&#13;
unreasonable to make (coupled with some additional public investment).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Page l7 of 18                               69&#13;
that of the education level they drop from). Provincial data on wages, drop out rates (by&#13;
grade), and transition rates are utilized in the estimation of outflows and benefits.'6&#13;

Total              4.03              1.17              5.20&#13;
Enhancing Quality. Investments to enhance quality will extend to (a high&#13;
proportion of) existing students as well as the new students generated by the project. Over the&#13;
thirty years of the calculation, the total number of quality beneficiaries amount to&#13;
approximately 4.3 million. We assume that a 15 percent additional wage premium can be&#13;
earned by higher quality graduates (equivalent to about an extra $1.5-2.5 per month,&#13;
depending upon provincial wages).&#13;
B. Costs&#13;
Investment costs are divided into those related to increasing access and those which&#13;
enhance quality, for each of the four provinces. They are spread over six years, with very&#13;
little investment in the first year of the project, followed by several years of heavy capital&#13;
outlays and tapering off in the sixth year. A provincial average annual per student recurrent&#13;
cost is imposed throughout the project and subsequently for the remaining twenty-five years&#13;
(amounting to about $100). Similarly, annual recurrent costs for senior secondary and&#13;
university education are added to total costs since a significant portion of the benefits accrue&#13;
as a result of junior secondary students proceeding up the system. On the quality side, an&#13;
incremert of $8 is assumed to represent the recurrent cost of additional quality&#13;
improvemients. No quality enhancements are factored for senior secondary and tertiary.&#13;
16 In cases wbere provincial wage rates are not reliable, national wages were used as an approximation.&#13;

NTT                                     12.9% (14.0%)&#13;
Incremental recurrent costs for quality&#13;
improvement increase from $8/student to&#13;

NTT                                     20.6% (22.0%)&#13;
In all, the main variables to which the system appears to be most sensitive are those&#13;
affecting quality. This is not surprising given the large numbers of beneficiaries which are&#13;
impacted by this investment.&#13;

East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
GENERAL PROFILE OF EAST JAVA&#13;
General Background. East Java, with 32 million inhabitants, stands today at the forefront of&#13;
modem Indonesia, its economy spurred by rising industrialization and modernizing agriculture, a&#13;
blend not unlike that which occurred in Korea duruig the 1960s. East Java ranks alongside the&#13;
Chao Ph_ ya Delta of Thailand, the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, and the Irrawaddy Delta of&#13;
Burma as one of the biggest and most fertile agricultural hinterlands of South-East Asia.&#13;
Surabaya, the province capital and the second largest city in the country, has become the leading&#13;
economic pole around which the Eastern half of Indonesia gravitates.&#13;
In the 1960s East Java was considered a backward region with little economic potential,&#13;
as its oilfield was depleted, it had no timber or mineral resources to attract foreign investment,&#13;
and its road infrastructures was in complete disrepair.  It had, however, a provincial&#13;
administration which had maintained a high degree of professionalism, and was headed by a&#13;
very charismatic civilian leader, Governor Noer. The province thus made the best of the rice&#13;
intensification program launched in 1967, of the family planning program started in 1968, and of&#13;
the Village Development Grant Scheme (Inpres Desa Tertinggal --IDT-- "Presidential Program&#13;
for Left-behind Villages") introduced in 1969. Thanks to big increases in government spending&#13;
in the 1970s, and then to its own dynamism, East Java's economy has been growing steadily&#13;
since, at rates above the national average.&#13;
Th, province's overall picture of prosperity, however, contrasts sharply with the&#13;
relatively hi- lievels of poverty still found in East Java -- 22 percent of the population lives&#13;
under the poverty level (20 percent nationally), and the illiteracy rate for people 10-year old and&#13;
above is 23 percent in East Java, as compared to 16 percent nationwide. Sixteen out of 37&#13;
districts have more than 25 percent of their villages targeted by the IDT program, a 1994&#13;
Presidential initiative providing special assistance to the poorest communities of the country.&#13;
Physical Environment East Java has a tropical climate, with six months of 'dry' season&#13;
(meaning less than 60 millimeters of monthly precipitation), annual rainfall of more than 2,000&#13;
millimeters, and constantly warm weather (except at higher altitudes). The province is transected&#13;
from East to West by a spine of volcanic mountains with peaks sometimes exceeding 3,000&#13;
meters, which feed three main river basins: the Bengawan Solo basin in the north-west, the&#13;
Brantas basin running south-west to north-east in the middle of the province and ending in&#13;
Surabaya, and the Pekalen-Sampean basin at the eastern end of the province. These lowland&#13;
areas constitute the primary areas of intensive irrigated cultivation, with 1,000 kilometers of&#13;
primary canals and 10,000 kilometers of drainage canals irrigating about a million hectares.&#13;
The highlands represent 14 percent of the total area of East Java, and were not settled&#13;
before the mid-nineteenth century, when population pressure in the lowlands and coffee&#13;
cultivation made them attractive. The highlands derive specific environmental importance from&#13;
their&#13;
hydrological role. The cultivation of increasingly steeper slopes, brought out by a growing&#13;
demographic pressure in the last two decades, has translated into a greater hydrological&#13;
instability, and more frequent destructive flash floods in the lowlands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The south-west (Pacitan, Ponorogo, Trenggalek and Tulungagung) and northwest coast&#13;
(Bojonegoro and Tuban) Kabupatens, as well as the drought-prone Madura Island, are&#13;
characterized by low limestone hills. These are the poorest areas in the province, whose&#13;
economic activity is limited to rain-fed cultivation without any real prospect for industrialization.&#13;
People have been moving out of these areas in search of employment throughout this century.&#13;
History Until the 14th century the island of Java was dominated by a series of Hindu-Buddhist&#13;
kingdoms, which lasted well into the Dutch occupation. The most successful of them, ruled by&#13;
the Majapahit dynasty, established in the 14th century an empire which, for the time of about a&#13;
generation, dominated from its base in East Java most of the territory of modem Indonesia. The&#13;
islamization of Java, first carried out by Arab traders from the 8th century on, and then more&#13;
forcefully by Melaka rulers in the l 5th century, was gradual, and proceeded apace during the&#13;
European intervention in the region.&#13;
To insure the security of its trade the United East India Company (VOC) gradually&#13;
became involved in the Javanese kingdoms' court politics and wars. In the 19th century the&#13;
Dutch government took control and turned Java into a fully colonial society, but not until after&#13;
the Java War of 1825-30, a fierce guerrilla conflict which killed an estimated 200,000 people.&#13;
Starting in 1830 the Dutch government put in place the Cultivation System, which forced&#13;
Javanese farmers to grow export crops. From the 1 870s on, government monopolies were&#13;
progressively replaced by free trade and the development of plantations. During the last half-&#13;
century of colonial rule, which ended with the Japanese occupation, the Dutch plantations of East&#13;
Java used to produce 2/3rd of the colony's sugar, nearly all its coffee, and large quantities of&#13;
high-quality cigar tobacco.&#13;
Culture. Contrary to many other provinces, East Java has an ethnically highly homogeneous&#13;
population, with only a small but economically active Chinese minority standing apart from the&#13;
Javanese plurality. Ninety five percent of the population counts itself as Muslim.&#13;
If many Javanese express pride at the achievements of the court of Surakarta and&#13;
Yogyakarta, most tend not to identify with this elite tradition, nor with a specific lineage or clan&#13;
as is customary in many regions of Indonesia, but rather with their own villages. These villages&#13;
are subdivided into smaller neighborhood associations -rukun tetangga- the Javanese word rukun&#13;
describing, according to anthropologist Robert Jay, both a "state of being and a mode of action ...&#13;
a state in which all parties are at least overtly at peace with one another"; "[it is] a process of&#13;
sharing through collective action." These neighborhoods gather for rituals, organize sports teams&#13;
and youth groups, or set up rotating credit associations, and sometimes collaborate on harvesting&#13;
rice.&#13;
The Javanese language is characterized by its complex rules of etiquette. When&#13;
addressing someone, Javanese speakers must choose from several different levels of politeness&#13;
In general, a person uses the highest level to speak to high-status people in formal situations and&#13;
the lowest&#13;
levels to speak to people of lower rank or with whom one is most intimate. Children learn to&#13;
speak the lowest level first, but are soon taught to address their father respectfully, using refined&#13;
speech, and failure to do so will result in a sharp reprimand. Fro Javanese, learning the proper&#13;
degree of shame is a matter of becoming aware of one's vulnerability in interaction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2: Page 3 of 8                              73&#13;
Population. East Java, like the rest of Java island, is densely populated, with 678 persons per&#13;
square kilometer, and population has been growing at a steady but declining pace: 1.6 percent&#13;
from 1961 to 1971, but 0.8 percent for the period 1985-90. This abatement of demographic&#13;
growth is the result of a voluntarist family planning program started in the early 1970s (this&#13;
national program has been more particularly successful in East Java). Cities have been&#13;
expanding rapidly in the last two decades, growing annually by 4.5 percent between 1980 and&#13;
1990, a.nd as a result the province's urbanization rate reached 27.5 percent in 1990. Still, some&#13;
areas ot the province remain extremely rural, and half of the 37 districts do not exceed a 19&#13;
percent urbanization rate.&#13;
East Java's high population density creates tremendous pressure on the land, pushing the&#13;
poorest farmers and the young to migrate to the cities, or to relocate on other islands through the&#13;
massive Transmigration Program (between 1971 and 1980, the outmigration rate grew from 2.94&#13;
to 5.47 percent). Studies of migration patterns within the province have shown that most&#13;
migrants (almost equallyv male and female) first moved between ages 15 and 34, when still&#13;
single, leaving a rural area for an urban center where they predominantly took jobs in the&#13;
informal sector. Migrants (inter and intra-provincial) are usually better educated: In 1985, among&#13;
intra-provincial migrants aged 20 and over, half the males and a third of the females had&#13;
completed junior secondary school, a completion rate three times higher than the average for the&#13;
total population. Also, migrants to the industrial region were better educated than migrants to&#13;
other regions, with 42 percent of males and 23 percent of females having had a senior secondary&#13;
education..&#13;
Economic Activity. The two major stimulants to East Java's development since the 1960s have&#13;
been the Green Revolution in rice production, which has nearly trebled since 1968, and the&#13;
growth of the manufacturing industry, particularly in the late 1980s. But the expansion of the&#13;
construction and transport sectors, as well as commercial and financial activities more generally,&#13;
have been complementary to those achievements and have provided vastly more employment.&#13;
The regional economiiy experienced a structural shift during the 1970s and 1980s: the&#13;
share of agriculture in the economy declined from 50 percent in 1970 to less than 25 percent in&#13;
1987 (and agriculture's share of employment went down from 56 percent in 1987 to 43 percent in&#13;
1994), the industrial sector increased from 14 to 25 percent, with the central core region&#13;
becoming a center of manufacturing industry growth. (Most of the industrial activity is located&#13;
in a corridor that developed along the highways joining Gresik, Sidoarjo, Mojokerto, Pasuruan&#13;
and Malang to Surabaya.) Services also grew from 36 to 50 percent. While all sectors grew&#13;
between 1983 and 1987, the largest growth rate was in manufacturing (7 percent) and services (6&#13;
pz, cent).&#13;
Today East Java boasts the second largest industrial base of the country in terms of&#13;
employment and establishments, and contributes about 22 percent of the national value added by&#13;
manufacturing. It is the only province which has achieved impressive growth rates and relatively&#13;
higher per capita incomes without the advantage of substantial natural resources (oil, timber) or&#13;
special stimuli like tourist dollars or a massive influx of external capital. The two most important&#13;
manufacturing activities are the industry of kretek (clove cigaretes) and sugar milling, with kretek&#13;
representing in 1985 more than 60 percent of the total value added of the 12 major industries&#13;
(which also included weaving, yarn, machinery, metal structure products, fertilizer, cosmetic and&#13;
perfume, cement, coconut oil, milk products and beer).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Education and Small Villages. Up until the early 1970s, the rapid economic&#13;
development of Java Timur seemed to be all but a foregone conclusion, and socio-economic&#13;
indicators depicted a rather backward region. Accordingly, education in rural areas usually did&#13;
not exceed a few years of primary school for the children of the wealthiest families. Sending a&#13;
child off to a distant secondary school did not appear to parents as an appealing option. Overall,&#13;
the village and its traditional culture were still the main frame of reference for poor as well as&#13;
rich families, and links with the world at large were often only tenuous.&#13;
Starting in the 1970s, several factors went into play which disrupted the self-centeredness&#13;
of the villages: the improvement of the road systems, which had been the top priority of the&#13;
provincial administration since the mid-1960s; the introduction of new rice varieties, which&#13;
doubled yields in the course of 15 years, and helped farmers shift from self-subsistence to market&#13;
agriculture; the booming national oil income, which percolated down to the districts through a&#13;
program of primary schools construction.&#13;
The social treatment of television sets, which started to make their way in the villages in&#13;
the mid to late 1970s, presents an exemplary illustration of the transformation of village life&#13;
under these new economic conditions. Color television sets, which retailed for about $300-500,&#13;
were initially publicly displayed on the verandas of the richest families, allowing the whole&#13;
neighborhood to enjoy it. The TV set was still treated as some form of public good, very much&#13;
in the tradition of the slametan festivals, which acted as a form of wealth redistribution scheme&#13;
within the community.&#13;
This attitude, however, quickly evolved, as the wealthiest families started to perceive&#13;
themselves less and less as a part of the village community, and more and more as part of the&#13;
larger national community. As a result, TV sets gradually retreated within the private sphere of&#13;
home, progressively shielded by windows and curtains. And it was for education as it was for&#13;
TV: children were increasingly sent off to secondary school, and some to college, as links with&#13;
the world at large were perceived as more and more desirable economically and socially.&#13;
Progressively the village ceased to be the central reference for the local elite.&#13;
For the small farmers and the poor however, the village and its traditional values have&#13;
remained the central locus and focus of life, a fact which sometimes translates into the expression&#13;
of a distrust of the modem ways adopted by the elit. The actual impact of this attitude upon&#13;
education demand however is difficult to evaluate, and could not easily be separated from the&#13;
sheer financial burden of education, which for the poor remain a considerable obstacle.&#13;

GENERAL PROFILE OF NUSA TENGGARA TIMUR&#13;
Nusa Tenggara Timur is at the exact opposite pole from East Java on the scale of social&#13;
and economic development. NTT has the lowest RGDP per capita (about 40 percent of national&#13;
per capita GDP) of all 27 provinces, and its rate of economic growth from 1983 to 1991 was 5.2&#13;
percent, as compared to an average growth rate of 6.6 percent for Indonesia, and 7.4 percent for&#13;
Java. Social indicators are below average: 24 percent of the population live under the poverty&#13;
line (as compared to 15 percent nationally), and 69 percent of the population has monthly levels&#13;
of expenditures below Rp 20,000 (45 percent nationally); incidence of moderate and severe&#13;
protein energy malnutrition is about 16 percent in rural areas. One fifth of NTT villages are&#13;
listed as IDT villages.&#13;
The 1990 census counted 3.3 million inhabitants in NTT, unevenly distributed among&#13;
the islands, and mostly rural (89 percent). Ethnically and linguistically, NTT population is&#13;
extremely fragmented, with varying social and political traditions. This diversity however is&#13;
starting to be slowly erased by the systematic use of Bahasa Indonesia in schools, the&#13;
development of national communication technologies and infrastructures, the increasing&#13;
marketisation of the economy, and Government's strong promotion of the Pancasila ideology.&#13;
There are only a few disparities in economic achievement between the different&#13;
Kaoupaten, with Kupang (*)standing out as an island of relative prosperity in the province (see&#13;
table). Most of the economic activity in Kupang is concentrated in the tertiary sector (72 percent&#13;
in 1991), as the city is the administrative capital of the province.&#13;

Physical environment. NTT is comprised of the four main islands of Sumba, Flores, Timor and&#13;
Alor, 38 smaller inhabited islands, and 524 uninhabited islands. Communication is therefore a&#13;
key constraint, for the people living on the smaller islands as well as for those living on the main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

'lands, where many villages are still not connected by all-weather roads to the provincial and&#13;
Kabupaten road network.&#13;
The islands are mostly mountainous, with only a third of the total land area suitable for&#13;
agriculture, and the soils, which are in general volcanic or coralline, are prone to drought during&#13;
the dry season. The province is prone to volcanic and seismic activity, the latest manifestation of&#13;
which being the disastrous 1992 earthquake in Flores. With a semi-arid climate mostly&#13;
influenced by the Australian system, the islands have a 8 to 9 month-long dry season, and&#13;
experience very uneven (from 800 to 3,000 mm per year according to location) and variable&#13;
rainfall. As a consequence, there is a general lack of close, reliable water supply, which forces&#13;
women and children to haul the water from distant sources.&#13;
Only 16 percent of the land area is cultivated, mainly through upland and shifting&#13;
cultivation (irrigation is possible on less than 10 percent of the cultivable land). The growing&#13;
demographic pressure, the use of slash and bum agriculture, and overgrazing are resulting in the&#13;
progressive degradation of land.&#13;
History. NTT sits at the boundary of two major etbno-cultural realms: the Malay and the&#13;
Melanesian worlds, which intermingled in that region before the European intervention starting&#13;
from the 15th century (first Portuguese, then Dutch troops and settlers). There has been also a&#13;
somewhai marginal Arab influence, through the localized presence of Arab traders as early as the&#13;
12th century. As a result, NTT's population is extremely heterogeneous, with, for instance,&#13;
Flores' population comprising 5 major ethno-linguistic groups, and Alor's counting up to 40&#13;
separate ethno-linguistic groups.&#13;
Thanks in part to its poor natural endowment, NTT has long stood on the sidelines of the&#13;
colonial history of the region. When in the early 17th century the Dutch ships of the VOC&#13;
(United East India Company) started to sail the Indian Ocean, they concentrated most of their&#13;
plundering efforts on the Mollucas and the Greater Sunda Islands (Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra).&#13;
Except for some trading outposts (in particular for sandalwood and slaves), they largely ignored&#13;
the islands of Sumba, Flores and Timor, part of what was then called the Lesser Sunda Islands.&#13;
In the mid-nineteen century, however, the Dutch extended and strengthened their control onto the&#13;
Eastem islands, a move which aimed at checking the expansion of the British empire from its&#13;
base in the Malay peninsula.&#13;
A wave of religious prozelitism followed in the wake of the Dutch administrators, with&#13;
jesuit and Lutheran missionaries competing in the construction of missions, hospitals and schools&#13;
throughout the islands. Unlike in Java, Sumatra or Bali, they did not encounter the resistance of&#13;
already strongly established religious systems (Islam or Hinduism), but rather a wide variety of&#13;
animistic beliefs. Today the population of NTT is in its great majority catholic or Protestant.&#13;
Islam only represents a minority (about 9 percent of the population) to be found mostly in cities&#13;
like Kupang.&#13;
However, the colonial and world religions' influence constituted only a thin veneer,&#13;
under which the traditional culture and social and political organizations have long persisted. In&#13;
the islands the indigenous feudal princedoms, the traditional class hierarchies and rules of&#13;
behavior (adat), and age-old magico-religious practices still largely inform social life. These&#13;
traditional structures sometimes coincide with more modern forms of organization, and it is not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

uncommon to find the heir of a royal family in the official role of Bupati (administrative chief of&#13;
the district), and drawing a great deal of his local legitimacy from his lineage.&#13;
In modern times, because of the policy of national integration, there has been a fairly&#13;
important Javanese influence, both through the posting of Javanese in most governmental&#13;
positions, and through the education system and the media. Most of inmigrants to NTT today are&#13;
from Javanese origin (with 40.4 percent of 1990 46,310 inmigrants coming from Java).&#13;
Demography. With 3.3 million in the 1990 census, NTT represents less than 2 percent of&#13;
Indonesia's total population. Its rate of population growth -1.78 percent for 1980-90- is lower&#13;
than most other regions and than the national average of 1.96 percent. However, NTT fertility&#13;
rate is higher than average with 4.5 children per woman (3 on national average), but this is more&#13;
than offset by a higher infant mortality rate (77 against 71 at the national level) and a strong&#13;
outmigration. Life expectancy has improved considerably since 1970, going from 44.4 to 58.6&#13;
years in 1990 (only one year less than tile national average). NTT's average family size is also&#13;
larger -5.3 in 1990- than nationally (4.5).&#13;
Outmigration, both to other provinces or to other countries, is the main factor alleviating&#13;
population pressure. Outmigration towards other provinces has increased sharply in the last&#13;
decade, going from 47,534 in 1980 to 99,442 in 1990. When evened with inmigration, which&#13;
has only slightly grown during that decade, the overall migration balance is negative, and&#13;
represented 1.62 percent of total population in 1990. The main destinations for outmigration are&#13;
East Timor, East Java and Jakarta.&#13;
International outmigration is not well documented, as most of it occurs outside the legal&#13;
channels, which people use to avoid the government's migration fee and the bureaucratic red&#13;
tape. One of the main destinations for outmigration is Sabah, where according to a conservative&#13;
estimate around 100,000 people from NTT have migrated. This outmigration is to some extent&#13;
reflected in demographic statistics, with the 1990 census counting 78 males for 100 females in&#13;
East Flores. There is indeed a long tradition of migration from Flores to Sabah, dating back from&#13;
the Japanese retreat at the end of World War II, when the imperial army took to Borneo coolies&#13;
forcefully drafted from Flores.&#13;
Economic activity. Agriculture is the main activity, representing about 36 percent of RGDP&#13;
(national average is 20 percent), and employing more than 80 percent of the work force. About&#13;
90 percent of farm families cultivate rice or secondary crops, and the wealthiest 40 percent keep&#13;
livestock, which is the most significant status symbol in NTT. Cattle is used to some extent for&#13;
farm work but mostly as a vector for savings.&#13;
Manufacturing is almost negligible, and represented only 2.0 percent of NTT's GDP in&#13;
1991. Government is the second most important sector of employment, and has on its payrolls&#13;
7.5&#13;
percent of NTT labor force (by comparison, at the national level government employees account&#13;
for 5 percent of the total labor force).&#13;
Tourism is the growth industry of NTT, and has enjoyed an explosion in recent years,&#13;
most of it concentrated in Flores. The number of tourists coming to the islands grew from&#13;
10,085 in 1985 (4,075 foreign and 6,010 domestic) to 52,060 in 1989 (18,531 foreign), and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                               Annex 2: Page 8 of 8&#13;
187,509 in 1991 (82,806 foreign). The destinations of choice are four Kabupaten of Flores&#13;
(Manggarai, Ende, East Flores, Sikka), and Kupang.&#13;
Education. Thanks to its tradition of Christian education, the illiteracy level in NTT is not as&#13;
high as in Indonesian regions with a similar economic background. NTT's illiteracy rate is 21.9&#13;
percent, to be compared with 16 percent at the national level, but 54.9 percent in East Timor and&#13;
31.3 percent in Iran Jaya. Illiteracy is mostly concentrated in the older age groups, and gender&#13;
differences, which used to be prevalent, have all but disappeared in the younger generations. The&#13;
general level of education of the population aged 15 and over has substantially improved since&#13;
1971 (the number of males with no schooling went down from 38.2 percent in 1971 to 18.1&#13;
percent in 1990), but the lag with the rest of Indonesia has remained the same (with a differential&#13;
of 5.9 percentage points).&#13;
It must be noted that education carries a great deal of social prestige in NTT, and parents&#13;
do not hesitate to sell their cattle and go into debt to finance the education of their children.&#13;
Indeed, in the last decade the level of education of one's children has become a sign of social&#13;
prominence at least as important as the possession of cattle, and well diplomed children will&#13;
allow one into the community's innermost circle.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
TEACHER TRAINING&#13;
A. Background&#13;
The teacher development programs in Indonesia, through their twenty years of history,&#13;
have succeeded in developing an extensive group of secondary school teachers into teacher trainers&#13;
both at the provincial and district levels, respectively the instructors, who run the Permantapan&#13;
Kerja Guru or PKG Model C program, and guru inti, who run the Musywara Guru Mata or&#13;
MGMP program, who constitute an invaluable human resource for quality improvement activities.&#13;
However, in spite of this achievement, evidence of improved pedagogy in the classroom is hard to&#13;
find outside the most favored schools in large urban centers. It can be said that Indonesian junior&#13;
secondary education teachers deliver a body of planned curriculum content, but pay insufficient&#13;
attention to what and how pupils are learning. Thus, in order to improve teachers' classroom&#13;
efficiency, changes in teacher training are suggested in three areas: curriculum content, delivery&#13;
mechanisms and training program management, which are outlined in the following sections C &amp;&#13;
D. The recommendations for the reform of the teacher training component of the project (content&#13;
and delivery) are based on the findings of the JGF-sponsored report 'Secondary Education in&#13;
Indonesia: Strengthening Teacher Competency and Student Leaming" produced in the context of&#13;
the project's preparation, and available in the files (Annex 27)&#13;
B. Project Activities&#13;
The teacher training component of the project would consist of two distinct types of&#13;
activity: first, reforming the content of existing teacher training programs and, second, providing&#13;
support for the reformed delivery of teacher training (for about 18,700 teachers in East Java, and&#13;
about 4,100 teachers in NTT). A detailed implementation plan would be prepared and included in&#13;
the Project Implementation Handbook to be produced at the onset of the project and distributed to&#13;
the PPIUs and CPCU as well as to concemed administrative officers.&#13;
C. Training Program Reform&#13;
The content of all in-servicing activities are expected to be revitalized, and as a result,&#13;
future programs would pay much more attention to promoting student leaming than they do at&#13;
present.  Emphasis would be given to the development of effective presenting, explaining,&#13;
questioning and probing techniques, so that teachers become skilled in identifying students'&#13;
leaming strategies and difficulties. Teachers would leam to construct open-ended formative tests&#13;
for use in the classroom, and to use the results to improve learning.&#13;
Preparing the first draft of this new training program would be the responsibility of the&#13;
Development Team for the relevant subject. They would work in collaboration with national and&#13;
intemational consultants.&#13;
The Development Teams and the consultants would also be responsible for devising&#13;
suitable tests for monitoring pupils' learning during the course of the project. The majority of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5: Page 2 of 4                             87&#13;
test questions should test higher-order learning skills rather than simple recall, and should be in&#13;
open-ended format. Models from best current international practices would be used as a guide in&#13;
devising these tests.&#13;
National consultants would be drawn from teacher training (IKIPs and FKIPs) and similar&#13;
institutions. They would be required to have had recent and relevant experience in Indonesian&#13;
schools, involving the application of effective subject-specific pedagogical methods. International&#13;
consultants--with working knowledge of Bahasa Indonesia--would likewise be specialists in&#13;
subject-specific pedagogy, with recent and relevant school-based expedience.&#13;
During the first year, consultants and instructors would monitor the implementation of the&#13;
new programs. At the end of the year, the programs would be evaluated, and revised in the light of&#13;
implementation experience.&#13;
D. Teacher Training Delivery and Management&#13;
Training would be delivered through two modes: provincial-level programs for the isolated&#13;
schools (PKG Model C), which would have the priority under the project, and cluster-level&#13;
programs for the more accessible schools in rural and urban areas (MGMP).&#13;
In both programs, the most important change would be the establishment of a regular&#13;
schedule of school visits that would replace on-service training. The purpose of these visits would&#13;
be not only to provide professional guidance to teachers, but also to monitor their performance.&#13;
All teachers - not just those involved in in-service activities - would be observed.&#13;
a) PKG Model C&#13;
TIhe PKG Model C would address the needs of the isolated schools, and would be managed&#13;
by the province. Two major innovations are proposed: a full year program and systematic school&#13;
Visits.&#13;
Duration. The training program for each batch of teachers should run for a full year.&#13;
There would be three in-service training sessions instead of the current two, to ensure that subject&#13;
content for the full teaching year is covered.&#13;
School visits. Three visits should be made to participating schools each year (where this is&#13;
feasible and cost effective). Instructors would visit schools in teams of two, one to observe lessons&#13;
in mathematics and science, the other, lessons in Bahasa Indonesia, English, and geography.&#13;
Instructors should observe lessons by all teachers in the school, rather than just those currently&#13;
engaged in the training program for schools in more difficult areas. Head teachers of the schools&#13;
would be given training as part of the in-service training network to provide systematic pedagogical&#13;
support (technical supervision) to teachers in their schools.&#13;
As this program addresses the training needs of schools in remote areas, it would be fully&#13;
financed by the project and would receive priority financing. The coverage area of the program&#13;
would first be comprehensively determined, so as to ensure that no school fall into a gray area&#13;
between the PKG Model C and the MGMP coverage areas. The kanwil-based management team&#13;
would establish for every year a schedule, and would select the teachers to benefit from the&#13;
program during that year on the basis of pre-established criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88                                Annex 5: Page3of4&#13;
b) MGMP&#13;
Schools in cities and easily accessible rural areas would be covered by the revised MGMP&#13;
training formula, and would be essentially independent and self-financing, but would be eligible&#13;
for Project support under certain conditions (criteria to be defined in the implementation plan).&#13;
Management. The program will be managed by Ka Kandep or his representative, working&#13;
with a group of headmasters representing the participating schools. The management team will&#13;
divide the kabupaten into clusters of appropriate size, and be responsible for finances (particularly&#13;
yearly requests for Project funding), the maintenance of records, and arranging the trainers' work&#13;
schedules.&#13;
Meetings. Cluster-level teachers' meetings will be held on a regular basis, approximately&#13;
15 times per year. A cluster level management team consisting of the head teachers of the&#13;
participating schools will set the timetable, guru inti will be responsible for arranging and running&#13;
the program.&#13;
School visits. Guru intl will carry out systematic visits to all junior secondary schools on&#13;
a regular basis. During the visit, the guru inti will observe a lesson taught by every teacher in his&#13;
specialist subject, provide feedback, and write a report highlighting achievements as well as&#13;
identifying areas where there is need for improvement. A file of reports will be maintained.&#13;
Visits from the provincial team. Subject specialist pengawas (supervisors) and instructors&#13;
will visit the kabupaten on a regular basis to guide and monitor the guru inti's work. They will&#13;
review the guru inti's school reports and visit cluster meetings.&#13;
Incentives for improvement will be introduced including the display of outstanding&#13;
students' work at the cluster center, the presentation of model lessons by outstanding teachers at&#13;
special cluster meetings, and opportunities for upgrading and promotion for guru inti.&#13;
Funding. The MGMP management teams, established for a cluster of schools, would be&#13;
eligible for project funding and would need to present to the PIU a request for the academic year.&#13;
Funding would cover only the teachers fitting the pre-established criteria.&#13;
Training Fund. The Project would establish a Training Fund that would provide, upon&#13;
request by the MGMP management teams, the following inputs:&#13;
* An honorarium of Rp. 12,500 per day to LKGI-trained guru inti for each day spent at a&#13;
cluster-based in-service meeting as a trainer (including travel allowance).&#13;
*  An honorarium of Rp. 15,000 per day to LKGI-trained guru inth for each day spent on school&#13;
visits (including travel allowance).&#13;
*  A travel subsidy of Rp. 2,000 per meeting for any participant who must travel one hour or&#13;
more to attend the cluster meeting.&#13;
*  A fixed sum of Rp 25,000 per year for each subject group in each cluster, as a contribution&#13;
towards the cos: )f consumable training material.&#13;
&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE SCIENCE EDUCATION STUDY&#13;
A. The Study&#13;
1.    Objectives. To evaluate and select an innovative and cost effective approach to teach&#13;
JSE school children of Indonesia the basic scientific foundations of everyday life and&#13;
environment, and raise their awareness of the scientific understanding of technology. The&#13;
selected approach would be recommended to be adopted as a national strategy for science&#13;
education at the JSE level in Indonesia.&#13;
2.    Specific Issues.  Two models of science teaching at primary JSE level will be&#13;
evaluated in order to generate the necessary empirical data to establish their comparative cost-&#13;
effectiveness. The specific issues to be evaluated are:&#13;
(a)    The impact of the models on students' cognitive achievement in sciences,&#13;
problem solving, and attitudes toward self, school, and society;&#13;
(b)    The administrative feasibility of each model implementation; and&#13;
(c)    The search for the most cost-effective modality.&#13;
3.    Structure of the Study. The study will be based on a teaching experiment developed&#13;
(under the East Java and NTT Secondary liducation Project) in about 80 classrooms during&#13;
two school years. The study would be undertaken over a three-year period by a group with&#13;
high qualifications id experience in research and education policy analysis. The final report&#13;
is due in October, 2000.&#13;
B. Methodology&#13;
4.    Research Methodology.  To assess the impact of different models of science&#13;
education, a cost-effectiveness analytic framework will be applied. To the extent that cognitive&#13;
achievement, problem-solving, and students' attitudes can be measured, a cost-benefit&#13;
approach will be implemented. The cost analysis should focus on differences in the cost&#13;
between the different modalities of JSE science education. The examination of model&#13;
effectiveness will use the educational production function tools.&#13;
5.    The following elements must be included in the evaluation proposal:&#13;
(a)    The evaluation would look for the following three possible effects of different&#13;
models on the student:&#13;
(i)    Changes in cognitive achievement;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6: Page 2 of 5                             91&#13;
(ii)    Changes in problem solving skills; and&#13;
(iii)   Changes in attitudes toward science and technology, self, school, and&#13;
society.&#13;
(b)    The evaluation would contemplate three testing points in time for assessing the&#13;
possible differential effects of different models:&#13;
(i)   A base line, at the beginning of an academic year, measuring attitudes,&#13;
problem-solving skills, and knowledge about the learning objectives of&#13;
the science curriculum;&#13;
(ii)   Effects observable at the end of an academic year, after the students&#13;
have experienced the models; and&#13;
(iii)  Effects observable at the end of the following year. This requires a&#13;
longitudinal panel data gathered from the same cohort of students.&#13;
(c)    The sample design should take into account the different types of junior&#13;
secondary schools in the two project provinces. Students from schools not&#13;
participating in any of the two models will serve as the first control group, but&#13;
students in each model will form a control group when compared with students&#13;
in other models;&#13;
(d)    The unit of observation will be the students. Because students from the same&#13;
school will have many characteristics in common, a more aggregate exercise&#13;
using the school as a unit of analysis will fail to test the hypothesis we are&#13;
interested in, because of masking of individual differences through averaging;&#13;
(e)    The dependent variables to be included should be as follows:&#13;
(i)    Continuous cognitive and problem solving skills measures; and&#13;
(ii)   attitude measures.&#13;
(f)    The independent variables will include measures of parents' socioeconomic&#13;
background;  student  gender  and  age;  community  socioeconomic&#13;
characteristics; school/teachers characteristics, such as school nature and&#13;
modality, school expenditure per student, teacher quality, through and index of&#13;
quality of school inputs; and&#13;
(g)    Hvpothesis testing. Crosstabulation and regression analysis will be used in&#13;
order to attempt to detect any significant effects of particular models on&#13;
students' achievement and attitudes, as follows:&#13;
(1) The regression will be of the general type:Y = f (model, region,&#13;
background, individual, and school characteristics), where Y is one of&#13;
the dependent variables discussed above; and&#13;
(ii) To measure the cost-effectiveness of each model, the study will&#13;
require identification of the costs of each model, including supervision&#13;
of implementation, teacher training, materials, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

C. The Product&#13;
6.           Elements of Research Proposal. The final research proposals should include&#13;
the following elements:&#13;
(a)    Specification of main research (evaluation) questions;&#13;
(b)   Design of sample;&#13;
(c)    Design of information gathenrng instruments;&#13;
(d)   Definition of logistic of field work, including mechanisms to reduce&#13;
the attrition rate.&#13;
(e)    Definition of schedule of field work;&#13;
(f)    Definition of data processing.&#13;
(g)   Definition of statistical models and methods of analysis to be used.&#13;
(h)   Implementation schedule specifying the tasks to be done and their&#13;
respective duration. This element should also include report schedule.&#13;
A report should be produced and delivered to Dikmenum and the Bank&#13;
after the first two measures. The final report should include the results&#13;
from all measures and cost-effective analysis; and&#13;
(i)    Detailed budget, including costs by activity and type of expenditure,&#13;
i.e., direct (personnel and others) and  indirect costs.   The&#13;
implementation schedule and the budget would allow the contract to be&#13;
divided into several phases and payments to allow Bank review and&#13;
approval on intermediary steps (e.g., questionnaire and test design,&#13;
sample selection, review of first report.&#13;
7.           Criteria for Proposal Selection. The criteria for proposal selection include&#13;
the pertinence between the methodological and technical aspects of the proposal and the&#13;
specified research elements; the pertinence of the schedule proposed (adequate relation&#13;
between tasks and time proposed for implementation); and experience of the researchers in&#13;
education research, particularly in education evaluation.&#13;
D. Preparation, Coordination and Monitoring&#13;
8.           Study Coordination and Preparation. The PCU, as the agency responsible&#13;
for the proposed project, will coordinate the study experiment in conjunction with the PIUs in&#13;
East Java and NTT, which will be responsible for the local management.&#13;
9.           A specialist will be hired to serve as study coordinator at PCU under terms of&#13;
reference agreed upon with the Bank. Resources must be available for easy mobilization and&#13;
frequent visits to the study-related activities in East Java. In the East Java PIU, liaison&#13;
personnel must be selected and trained in a timely manner, in order to cooperate with the&#13;
coordinator in the experiment monitoring process. The coordinator's contract would start in&#13;
March, 1997 and end with the final report delivery in October, 2000.&#13;
10.   A consultant would be hired in February, 1997 for four months (under terms of&#13;
reference agreed upon with the Bank) to lead the preparation process, including curriculum,&#13;
materials and teacher training design, and relevant literature. The consultant's activities would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6: Page 4 of 5                            93&#13;
be based on a close dialogue with the Indonesian authorities, the coordinator and other&#13;
information-gathenrng strategies.&#13;
ll.          The coordinator and the consultant will develop the following activities:&#13;
(a)    Teaching Experiment.  The study will be conducted as a step-by-step&#13;
assessment of an actual teaching experiment taking place in project schools and&#13;
classrooms during the school years of 1998-99 and 1999-2000. A curriculum&#13;
will be designed, teachers trained on the selected methodologies, and&#13;
instructional materials developed, as follows:&#13;
(i)    Curriculum Design&#13;
(a)    A curriculum will be developed by Dikmenum for the first and&#13;
third grades, and the necessary equipment purchased or made.&#13;
Reference has to be made to the best examples of modem or&#13;
hands-on science teaching methods available.&#13;
(b)   To help Dikmenum design such curriculum, it is necessary to&#13;
gather information on the best (even international) experiences&#13;
carried out in science teaching at JSE education level.&#13;
(c)    Two different approaches to science study teaching at JSE level&#13;
would be adopted and tested in the schools. The final report&#13;
would recommend (with justification based on cost-&#13;
effectiveness) the best one to be later considered by MOEC.&#13;
(ii)   Teacher Training&#13;
(a)    Current teachers in different types of project schools will be&#13;
selected to be adequately and timely trained to play roles as&#13;
expected in their respective schools and classrooms.&#13;
(b)    Two  two-week (80 hours each) training sessions will take&#13;
place in August, 1997 and May, 1998. The program for the&#13;
teacher training programs must be agreed upon with the Bank.&#13;
(c)    Training must be given by experienced trainers (acceptable to&#13;
the Bank) in terms of content and methodology. Each trainer&#13;
specializes in one of the two approaches.&#13;
(iii)  Instructional Materials and Guides. Grade-related materials (according&#13;
to the curriculum) must be developed (made, printed, purchased).&#13;
Concrete experience and local experiments must be emphasized over&#13;
'bookish" description and formulation. Simple kits must be bought or&#13;
locally developed.&#13;
(b)    School Selection. A random sample of 160 (80 experiment +80 control)&#13;
classrooms will be selected (and confirmed by an agreement) for the study, as follows:&#13;
(i)    A set of 180 representative (first and third-graders; urban rural, public&#13;
and private) classrooms would be selected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94                             Annex 6: Page5of5&#13;
(ii)   The 80 control classrooms should be either in the same schools as&#13;
corresponding experiment classrooms or in comparable schools in the&#13;
same district.&#13;
(c)    Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
(i)    Each study school and classroom will be monitored either by the state&#13;
or the national coordinator. An early visit should be paid to each&#13;
selected school to recommend the experiment and support the science&#13;
teacher;&#13;
(ii)   Supervisors and school principals must be oriented (during their&#13;
training programs or during visits to their schools) on the objectives&#13;
and strategies of the experiment. Their support is extremely important&#13;
for the success of the study in the schools;&#13;
(iii)   Periodic progress reports will be submitted to Dikmenum and the&#13;
Bank, approximately twice a year, according to the calendar;&#13;
(iv)   A mid-term evaluation would be undertaken in July, 1999 to assess the&#13;
experiment development and make recommendations. Dikmenum,&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
MANAGEMENT TRAINING&#13;
I. Background&#13;
Objectives. The management training component aims at improving the junior&#13;
secondary education management efficiency and productivity in public, private and religious&#13;
schools, so that the access- and quality-related inputs provided by the project, GOI and other&#13;
donors yield the expected educational results in the schools. The project would achieve this by&#13;
(i) helping the central level shift towards a more policy-oriented, monitoring, technically&#13;
assisting and evaluating role; (ii) providing Kanwils, Kandeps and Kecamatans with the&#13;
managerial and analytical tools required for planning, policy and financial analysis, project&#13;
implementation, data gathering and evaluation; and (iii) improving headmasters' ability to&#13;
ameliorate student learning results, enhance the motivation and productivity of their teachers, and&#13;
learn ways to link their school with their catchment communities.&#13;
Skill-oriented training. The emphasis of the management training component would be&#13;
on the acquisition of technical, practical skills that can find an immediate application in the&#13;
administrative environment of the trainees. The acquisition of new managerial skills is expected&#13;
to be accompanied by long-lasting changes in behaviors and attitudes that could positively affect&#13;
the day-by-day processes and outcomes of schools and the system.&#13;
Ownership and Efficacy. With the increased emphasis on devolved responsibilities and&#13;
local participation and ownership the development of managerial skills at the sub-central levels&#13;
becomes a sine qua non condition for success. As the decision-making process for policy and&#13;
project implementation is moved from central offices to administrative instances closer to the&#13;
schools (Kanwils, Kandeps and Kecamatans), more dynamic skills are required for immediate&#13;
response and efficacy in the decision-making process. As a consequence, policy and&#13;
implementation plans must be discussed and agreed upon with PIU and Kanwils.&#13;
II. Program Development&#13;
The overall development of this component will be carried out in three major phases:&#13;
program design, program implementation and program evaluation.&#13;
A. Program Design&#13;
Development Team. The management training program will be designed under&#13;
supervision from the Program Coordination Unit (PCU) at Dikmenum by a "Development&#13;
Team" comprised of two international and two national consultants. The consultants (all with&#13;
recognized expertise in the area) will be hired by PCU for five months each during the first year&#13;
of the project..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
96                              Annex 7: Page2 of 5&#13;
Tasks. The Development Team, drawing in particular on the expertise of PCU's and&#13;
Project Implementation Units (PIU)'s staff and of other ad-hoc participants, is expected to:&#13;
*  review past and existing training programs and material in Indonesia's education sector&#13;
*  asses the types and levels of skills that are required at the various echelons of the&#13;
administrative system;&#13;
*  design the program curriculum and methodology for each skill area;&#13;
*  prepare training materials specific for each skill area, taking into account materials designed&#13;
for national or international programs;&#13;
*  field test the program curriculum, methodology and material;&#13;
*  set criteria for trainer selection in each area;&#13;
*  train the trainers in one-week workshops;&#13;
*  lay out an implementation schedule;&#13;
*  refine a set of output and performance indicators.&#13;
Guidelines. As a result, course implementation guidelines will be prepared by the&#13;
Development Team. The guidelines will include program and plan (objectives, content,&#13;
materials, skills to be developed), methodology, duration, evaluation and self-evaluation forms,&#13;
suggested bibliography. The guidelines will be used for trainers' training.&#13;
Skill training activities. The skill-training activities would focus on the following&#13;
management areas, which were the result of consultation with the provinces and Dikmenum, but&#13;
should not be considered exclusive:&#13;
-  Educational Planning:   Planning as a form of rational and intentional intervention.&#13;
National and provincial educational needs, demands and priorities. Economic retums of&#13;
schooling. Educational variables and the forecasting of social and economic development.&#13;
-  School Mapping:   Micro-planning technique that consists of much more than simply&#13;
placing schools on a map so as to analyze their geographical distribution. The key point is to&#13;
detennine if a given population has (or will have) easy access to the required school.&#13;
e  Policy Analysis:   National policies and priorities in education. Quality/efficiency and&#13;
equity issues. Policies, decentralization and local ownership. Financial issues. Public and&#13;
private, urban and rural, and girls education. Conditions for school effectiveness.&#13;
*  Monitoring and Evaluation: The establishment of (and agreement on) educational criteria&#13;
and standards. The role of performance indicators. Monitoring strategies, instruments and&#13;
timing. Quantitative and qualitative assessment. Evaluation and provision of feedback.&#13;
*  Information Analysis and Dissemination: What is information for? The development of&#13;
analytical capacity at the provincial and district level. Information for the decision-making&#13;
process. Simple ways to disseminate results back to information consumers.&#13;
*  Education Data Management:    The fundamentals of education data gathering and&#13;
analysis. Key concepts of education planning and evaluation. The school as the working&#13;
educational management unit. From data to information and the dissemination process.&#13;
*  Computer Use: Basics of computer literacy. Basic computer maintenance. Spreadsheet data&#13;
management. Wordprocessing.&#13;
*  Technical Supervision: From bureaucratic inspection to technical supervision linked to&#13;
teaching and teacher development at school level. Observation and communication skills&#13;
required from the new supervision. The headmaster as the principal and closer supervisor.&#13;
* Student Performance Assessment: Why do students differ in learning conditions and&#13;
processes? Teachers and techniques for assessing students' academic performance. Purposes&#13;
of macro and micro student performance assessment. Reporting the results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7: Page 3 of 5                              97&#13;
*  Management of School Facilities: Basics of school architecture. The school as a pleasant&#13;
environment that stimulates learning. Physical conditions of classrooms as the habitat for&#13;
learning. Users' (student, teachers) satisfaction. Cost-effective school maintenance.&#13;
*  Community Participation:  How  to seek inputs from  parents and encourage their&#13;
participation in a variety of school endeavors. Survey parents to obtain their views on the&#13;
school, its processes, programs and outputs. Include parents on school advisory bodies.&#13;
Trainers' Selection and Training&#13;
*  Trainers for all areas will be selected by PCU during the design phase among those&#13;
professionals with recognized proficiency and experience.&#13;
*  Selected trainers will have a one-week training workshop focusing on objectives,&#13;
methodology and evaluation.&#13;
*  The training workshop will be mostly based on the guidelines designed by the Development&#13;
Team.&#13;
*  Trainers will be distributed by PCU for central, provincial and district courses.&#13;
Ceteris paribus, trainers living in East Java and NTT should be preferred, provided that they meet&#13;
the professional quality criteria.&#13;
B. Program Implementation&#13;
Training Coordination. The program will be implemented on five administrative&#13;
levels (see Table 2): the central segment by PCU in Jakarta; the Kanwil segment by Kanwil in&#13;
Surabaya (East Java) and Kupang (NTT); the Kandep, Kecamatan and school segments by&#13;
Kandeps using local facilities. In every province the PIU plays a coordinating role. The training&#13;
implementation timetable is presented in Table 1. Skills to be developed, segments, levels and&#13;
number of participants are detailed on Table 2.&#13;

Trainees' Selection Criteria&#13;
*  Participants at PCU, Kanwil and Kandep levels must be involved with the East Java and&#13;
NTT Junior Secondary Educationi Project.&#13;
*  All the Kecamatan heads and all (private, public and religious) junior secondary school&#13;
headmasters in East Java and NTT qualify to participate in the program.&#13;
*  Each individual participant is allowed to take up to three 40-hour courses, or five 20-hour&#13;
courses, according to selector's decision.&#13;
*  For each traininig session PCU participants will be selected by PCU director; Kanwil&#13;
participants by Kakanwil and PIU director; Kandep, Kecamatan and school participants by&#13;
Kakandep.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98                               Annex 7: Page 4 of 5&#13;
*  The Kandep, Kecamatan and school headmasters training groups will be constituted of&#13;
participants hailing from the same Kandep. If any training session needs to involve trainees&#13;
from more than one Kandep, the Kanwil assumes a coordinating role.&#13;
*  Selectors will define the annual training groups, notifying the participants at least three&#13;
months in advance.&#13;
C. Program Evaluation&#13;
Program processes and results will be assessed through four types of evaluation: (a)&#13;
User's Survey; (b) Annual Implementation and Mid-term Reviews (SAR para. 5..9 &amp; 5.10); and&#13;
(c) Technical Audits (SAR para. 5.1 1).&#13;
User's Survey. The user's survey will be designed by an international consultant, and&#13;
will focus more specifically on the skills that the management training program is expected to&#13;
develop. The consultant will identify the users to be surveyed, and the periodicity of the survey.&#13;
The survey will be pre-tested under the supervision of the consultant. A base-line will have to be&#13;
established in the first year of the project. The consultant will be hired for four months, two for&#13;
survey design and test, and two for periodical analysis of results.&#13;

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EDUCATION&#13;
1.    Description of the Private Sector at Junior Secondary Level&#13;
The private sector has a large participation in the provision of education services at the&#13;
junior secondary level. In 1994/95, the latest academic year for which statistical information is&#13;
available, enrollments in public and private schools in the two project provinces were as follows:&#13;
Table 1: Public and Private School Enrollment by Province&#13;
Enrollments   Public Schools  Private Schools Private/Total&#13;
East Java      1,255,219         696,012         559,207      44.6%&#13;
NTT             110,866           65,576          45,290       40.9%&#13;
Indonesia      7,812,536       4,602,137       3,210,399      41.1%&#13;
The important part played by the private sector in the supply of junior secondary&#13;
education services is not a recent phenomenon.  Over the past 10 years, private school&#13;
enrollments have consistently been above 40 percent of the total for all of Indonesia, although&#13;
there has been a gradual reduction from about 46 percent in 1985/86. More specifically, the&#13;
share of private school enrollments declined until 1992/93 during a period of significant&#13;
reductions in total enrollments from the previous peak of 7.4 million in 1988/89. But it has been&#13;
kept constant at about 41 percent during the resurgence of junior secondary school enrollments in&#13;
the last two years.&#13;
With the exception of schools (Madrasahs) managed by local Islamic groups, whose&#13;
establishment is approved, and operation is supervised, by the Ministry of Religious Affairs&#13;
(MORA), private school establishment and operation is approved and supervised by the Ministry&#13;
of Education and Culture (MOEC). In 1994-95 there were 18,221 private schools in Indonesia,&#13;
10,674 of which were under the supervision of MOEC (SLTPs) and 7,547 Madrasahs (MTs).&#13;
The number of schools and of students in the project provinces were as follows:&#13;

School Establishment and Accreditation. Many private schools are established and&#13;
operated by local communities which have not succeeded in their efforts to have a public school&#13;
established, or by associations of teachers. In addition, a large number of private secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8: Page 2 of 4                               101&#13;
schools in Indonesia are established by various organizations, mostly of a religious character&#13;
such as the Mohammadiya and the Catholic Church. It should be noted, however, that in the&#13;
large majority of cases where schools are operated by organizations aiming at influencing local&#13;
communities, the specific location of the school is determined by whether a public school already&#13;
exists and, if so, whether such a school has the capacity to meet existing local demand for&#13;
education. It is rare to find cases of private schools in direct competition with public schools.&#13;
An organization starts the process of establishing a new private school by seeking a&#13;
favorable ruling on the part of the MOEC and local Government officials at the sub-district level.&#13;
The ruling is generally favorable if there is a large enough number of primary school graduates&#13;
(virtual demand) in the catchment area with no access to a public school to satisfy operation of&#13;
the proposed school. Once their approval is secured, the sponsoring group, through a non-profit&#13;
association (yayasan), submits an application to the district office of MOEC which eventually&#13;
must be approved by the head of the MOEC office at Province level (Kakanwil). It takes about 9&#13;
months for the whole process to be completed.&#13;
Schools are supervised and accredited by the MOEC Directorate of Private Schools,&#13;
through local MOEC officials at the Province and District levels.  Accreditation classifies&#13;
schools in one of four categories: "listed" (lowest), "registered", "recognized", and "equivalent"&#13;
(highest). A newly established school is classified as "listed", and a review for potential&#13;
upgrading of its status takes place three years later, when the school has produced its first&#13;
graduates. There are 8 quality criteria applied during review (such as student performance in&#13;
national exams, number of graduates, and adequacy of school facilities). Depending on the&#13;
results, the school may retain the "listed" status or be promoted to a higher category. In principle&#13;
(and also in a few actual cases), a school may be promoted immediately after the first review to&#13;
the highest "equivalent" category. But normally there is a more gradual progression following&#13;
successive reviews. The distribution by accreditation category and province is given in Table 3.&#13;
Table 3: Private Schools (SLTP) by Accreditation Level&#13;
Equivalent  %   Recognized   %   Registered   %   Listed   %    Total&#13;
East Java       91       5       1,333     79      125       7    142    8    1,691&#13;

Although the Directorate of Private Schools of MOEC does not collect information on&#13;
the association between school ownership and accreditation ranking, partial information from a&#13;
small number of provinces included in the proposed projects indicates the following:&#13;
"Equivalent" schools are in general owned and operated by religious organizations, while a few&#13;
of them are operated by teachers' associations; "Recognized" schools are in general owned and&#13;
operated by teachers' associations and other non-profit organizations (yayasans) while a few of&#13;
them are owned by religious organizations;  "Registered" schools are generally owned and&#13;
operated by teachers' associations and other non-profit organizations, while a large number also&#13;
belong to small town and village communities; Finally, "listed" schools are in general owned&#13;
and operated by small rural communities that do not have a public school in the community itself&#13;
or at a nearby location.&#13;

2.     Description of Public Support Program for Private Schools&#13;
The Government is aware of the benefits of a flourishing private sector in junior&#13;
secondary education. Its policy orientations are explicitly stated in Repelita VI (Book IV, pp. 98-&#13;
99 and 112-115 and accompanying Tables) indicating GOI's determination that private schools&#13;
should preserve and even increase their share in total junior secondary enrollments. More&#13;
important from a practical point of view, the public sector devotes significant amounts of&#13;
resources, in kind as well as in the form of money grants, to support and improve the quality of&#13;
private schools.  Support in kind includes secondment of public sector teachers to private&#13;
schools, distribution of textbooks free of charge, provision of equipment, and training of private&#13;
school teachers in publicly funded programs. Money grants are provided to about two thirds of&#13;
private schools at the lower end of financial viability (i.e., "listed", "registered" and part of&#13;
"recognized" schools).&#13;
Teachers. For all of Indonesia seconded teachers fill 16.2 percent of teaching posts in&#13;
private schools, with 8.7 percent in East Java and 24 percent in NTT (1993/94 figures). There&#13;
are however reliable indications that a disproportionately large number of seconded teachers&#13;
serve in "equivalent" and "recognized" private schools, while the poorest schools that have the&#13;
greatest need for them receive very inadequate allocations.&#13;
Textbooks. For private schools, estimated needs amount to 31 million textbooks and 1&#13;
million teacher guides. Actual distribution during 1993/94 - 1995/96 amounted to 15.5 million&#13;
textbooks and 0.3 million teacher guides. Thus, although large gaps still remain, public sector&#13;
contributions are very important in supplying this critical input for raising private school quality.&#13;
Teacher Training and Equipment. No tabulated information exists on the magnitude&#13;
of public sector funding for training private school teachers and supplying teaching equipment to&#13;
private schools. Officials in charge of these activities at MOEC estimate that the public sector&#13;
allocates about 20 percent of its training activities to private teachers, and distributes also about&#13;
20 percent of purchased school equipment to private schools.&#13;
Operational Cost Subsidies. Public sector subsidization of the operational cost of&#13;
private schools is granted to both SLTP and Madrasah schools and is in the form of a flat amount&#13;
per classroom (uniform for all provinces and subsidized schools). Although data on the total&#13;
number of private schools' classrooms are not available for 1995/96 and 1996/97, their numbers&#13;
for 1993/94 and 1994/95 indicate that the operational cost support program covers between 50&#13;
percent and 55 percent of SLTP classrooms, and between 90 percent and 95 percent of Madrasah&#13;
classrooms, for a combined total of about 65 percent of all private school classrooms. The&#13;
program targets schools at the lower end of financing capacity.&#13;
The overall level of public sector support to private schools is estimated at about US$58&#13;
million, or 9 percent of total public spending (development and recurrent) on junior secondary&#13;
education. Salaries of seconded teachers make up about two thirds of the total cost, textbooks&#13;
and teachers guides 17 percent, operational cost subsidies 12 percent, while teacher training and&#13;
distribution of equipment are less important cost items.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

3.     Description of Project Support for Private Schools&#13;
The project's financing for items such as teacher training and the provision of&#13;
instructional tools and library books would therefore complement GOI's own efforts. By raising&#13;
the standard of instruction at private schools, project funding for quality inputs would help&#13;
reduce the disparity between public and private education and encourage parents to view private&#13;
schooling as a worthwhile option. By stimulating demand for private schooling in this way, the&#13;
Government would limit the amount of public expenditure required to achieve its enrollment&#13;
targets.&#13;
Private schools in the project provinces would benefit directly from the following project&#13;
activities: (a) teacher in-service training through PKG and MGMP; (b) educational equipment;&#13;
(c) library books; (d) management training for headmasters. In addition, private schools would&#13;
benefit indirectly from such project activities as improved Kanwil management, monitoring, and&#13;
evaluation of schools and students as well as from the construction of public schools, whose&#13;
facilities are often used after-hours for private schooling through teacher associations.&#13;
4. Criteria For Assistance To Private Schools&#13;
a) Support for quality improvement to private schools will be in the form of reference and&#13;
library books, equipment, teacher training, and teacher and management upgrading programns.&#13;
b) Assistance in the form of in-kind educational inputs is preferable to grant for the following&#13;
reasons:&#13;
*  the above inputs in-kind can lead directly to the quality improvement sought, and to&#13;
the upgrading of the accreditation of the schools;&#13;
*  outputs or outcomes of assistance are more tangible;&#13;
*  assistance is easily monitored, such as number of teachers trained, books delivered,&#13;
equipment supplied, etc.;&#13;
*  distribution of assistance is more efficient;&#13;
* possible abuse of government assistance will be minimized.&#13;
c) Priority will be given to rural, remote, or poor private schools which have the potential to&#13;
increase enrollment and quality, especially self-help community private schools. Priority&#13;
will be given to viable private schools not receiving any other assistance from government.&#13;
d) Assistance will be awarded annually, and maintained if the school satisfies the above criteria.&#13;
e) Eligible private schools can apply to the head of MOEC district office (Kakandep) or to the&#13;
head of MOEC provincial office (Kakanwil) for government assistance.&#13;
f) Selection, review and decision processes will be undertaken by the Private School&#13;
Assistance Committee at Kanwil Office.&#13;
g) Recipient school will receive assistance annually, and can be extended upon satisfactory&#13;
performance.&#13;
h) The effectiveness of the private school assistance program would be monitored annually&#13;
using basic educational indicators in a structure format.&#13;

INNOVATIVE JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION MODALITIES&#13;
Two Innovative JSE Modalities&#13;
1.    Confronting the need to expand the access to JSE and considering that are the poor and&#13;
the rural children who are not enrolled, the Government has designed and adopted non-traditional&#13;
JSE modalities, planned to deliver JSE education at a relatively low cost for children who have&#13;
had no access to schools either because of financial constraints, or lack of schools in their&#13;
(mainly rural) areas. Two major experimental programs are now in progress, the "Small (Kecil)&#13;
JSE School" and the "Open (Terbuka) JSE," which provide equal opportunities for JSE access to&#13;
all children, regardless of their socio-economic status and habitat. Non-traditional JSE strategies&#13;
have been used by other countries with low JSE coverage rates such as Thailand (classroom&#13;
experience, radio and self-study), Mexico (Telesecundaria, a TV-supported strategy) and&#13;
Zimbabwe (study centers). The following table shows how the Indonesian junior secondary&#13;
Kecil and Terbuka approaches compare with regular JSE schools:&#13;

The "Small JSE" (SMP Kecil)&#13;
2.     Concept. This is a reduced version (with 3 or 6 classrooms) of a regular JSE school&#13;
The innovation here is the dimension of the school which is made smaller to meet the localized&#13;
demand in remote areas. The Kecil modality appears in two dimensions, either with 3 (Type E)&#13;
or 6 (Type D) classrooms to fit the demand posed by primary school graduates wherever they do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9: Page 2 of 3                             105&#13;
not exceed 120 (3 classrooms of 40 students each) or they reach approximately 240 (6 classrooms&#13;
of 40 students each).&#13;
3.     The school name (kecil= small) derives from the fact that so far the Govemment's JSE&#13;
facilities are rather large schools categorized as Type A (27 classrooms), Type B (18 classrooms),&#13;
and Type C (9 classrooms). Schools with less than nine classrooms were considered wasteful as&#13;
the overhead expenses were high, and the student/teacher ratios fall considerably.  However,&#13;
with the JSE universalization drive, some compromising was needed on cost effectiveness. The&#13;
Government now allows establishment of "Small JSE" (less than nine classrooms) with the&#13;
understanding that such schools would eventually grow to reach the minimum standard size of&#13;
nine classrooms. It is worth noticing that the vast majority of rural private schools have less than&#13;
nine classrooms.&#13;
4.     Analysis and Implications.  As a regular JSE school the Kecil conforms to all&#13;
administrative and academic regulations and standards of this school level. The only exception&#13;
is that, given the small size classes, teachers would be asked to teach more than one subject.&#13;
This has been successfully applied in a number of countries with similar socio-economic and&#13;
geographical constraints. Considering that at present the majority of JSE teachers are unqualified&#13;
(below D3 level), there is hardly any compromise in this proposal. Some classes could be held&#13;
in the afternoon, using part-time teachers from the nearest regular JSE. The problem would be&#13;
reduced to transportation costs.&#13;
5.     Project Strategy. The proposed project supports de construction of 169 Kecil schools in&#13;
East Java, 124 of 6-classrooms and 45 of 3 classrooms. In NTT 108 Kecil schools will be built,&#13;
being 52 of 6 classrooms, and 56 of 3 classrooms. Criteria have been established for the location&#13;
of these schools, each one of them including a library and a multi-purpose room.&#13;
The "Open JSE" (SMIP Terbuka)&#13;
6.     Concept. The "Open JSE" (Terbuka=- open) program is conceived as a major alternative&#13;
for JSE school age children who fail to enter a regular public school because of low grades in&#13;
national (Ebtanas) examinations, financial constraints in entering a public or private school, and&#13;
lack of schools in the area. The Terbuka model can serve either young workers in urban contexts&#13;
or notably children in scattered rural areas. Terbuka students are free in the mornings, so that&#13;
they work (most of them help their parents in farming or home chores) and adjust their "school"&#13;
schedules to domestic and seasonal peculiarities. Originally (1979), the Terbuka model was&#13;
developed by the MOEC's educational technology agency Pustekkom (Center for&#13;
Communication Technology for Education and Culture), as an experimental project consisting of&#13;
five schools in five different provinces. In 1984, when it was decided that the model should be&#13;
expanded, the project was managed by a joint team from Pustekkom and Dikmenum, the&#13;
Directorate for General Secondary Education.. Sixty-six percent of the 59 existing SMP Terbuka&#13;
were created between 1993 and 1995.&#13;
7.     When sufficient demand is posed by primary school graduates in rural communities and&#13;
Terbuka is selected as the preferred strategy, a regular JSE in the area is selected to be the base&#13;
school responsible for developing a network of (an average of five) satellite "Learning Centers"&#13;
(TKB= Tempat Kegiatan Belajar) in the communities where children live. Each local "Learning&#13;
Center" comprehends from 5 to 30 students who have two major kinds of learning activities: (a)&#13;
tutored sessions (four afternoons in the Week) in the "Learning Center" under the supervision of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
106                              Annex 9: Page 3 of 3&#13;
local tutor who normally is a primary school teacher; and (b) afternoon classes twice a week in&#13;
the base school with regular teachers. During the tutored sessions students do their home&#13;
assignments in a primary school, community center or other premises in the village. Students&#13;
and teachers are supplied with specially prepared "modules," or illustrated booklets written to be&#13;
self-instructional so that students can learn either individually or in group. They are provided&#13;
also with structured distance learning media such as radio, audio cassettes, slides, video-&#13;
cassettes etc. There are no attendance fees, but students pay for transportation to the base school&#13;
and for the modules. "Learning Centers" are periodically visited by base school's teachers for&#13;
remedial or supporting classes.&#13;
8.     Analysis and Implications So far there is no systematic evaluation of the Terbuka&#13;
experience. There is consensus, however, that specific demand exists, the Terbuka concept is&#13;
viable and the modules are well designed.. Girls predominate at Terbuka and student age seems&#13;
to parallel the age of those attending regular JSE schools,. The cost of delivering Terbuka is 52&#13;
percent of a regular JSE school. Weaknesses lie mainly in the often low qualification of tutors&#13;
and the relatively high costs of transportation, which adversely affect attendance. A dropout rate&#13;
of almost 50 percent was observed in some cases between the first and second grade. Ways and&#13;
means to improve the quality and increase retention rates should be explored.&#13;
9.    It seems unrealistic to expect that the Terbuka program as it stands today, can produce&#13;
results comparable to the regular JSE schools. The majority of students attending this program&#13;
are bound to be those with low achievement in primary schools. Class attendance and contact&#13;
with qualified teachers is greatly reduced. Modules need to be complemented by other&#13;
instructional materials. Quality and efficiency of the Terbuka program could, however, benefit&#13;
from the following initiatives:&#13;
(a)    Local tutors should be carefully selected from among primary school teachers&#13;
and given special training during at least three weeks. At present; they attend&#13;
only a 5-day training course;&#13;
(b)   the learning environment of the "Learning Center" should be enriched with&#13;
resource materials (reading and reference books, dictionaries, audio-visual aids)&#13;
to support students in doing their home assignments and complementing the&#13;
modules;&#13;
(c)    chief of villages, parents, and community members should be mobilized to&#13;
ensure that students do attend regularly tutorial classes. This social network&#13;
proved to be a successful approach in expanding access to primary education;&#13;
(d)    students' and teachers' transportation costs could be partly subsidized by the&#13;
Government; and&#13;
(e)   the program length could possibly be extended by one year. Students attending&#13;
Terbuka programs have the advantage of being able to work productively during&#13;
the school period.&#13;
10.   Project Strategy. The proposed project supports the Terbuka model by (a) providing a&#13;
set of reading and reference books for each "Learning Center"; and (b) training tutors for the&#13;
"Learning Centers." These activities are expected to complement what other donors (mainly the&#13;
Asian Development Bank-ADB, UNDP and UNESCO) are doing to support the expansion and&#13;
improvement of the Terbuka model.&#13;

STUDENT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM&#13;
A. Background&#13;
Families in the lower income deciles bear large financial burdens when their&#13;
children attend junior secondary school, relative to the total monthly family expenditures&#13;
(between 40% and 80%). These costs include school registration fees, tuition, parental&#13;
contributions, expenses for unifroms, transport, books and other costs. Furthermore,&#13;
children from poor families attending school incur additional costs in the form of foregone&#13;
income they could earn within or outside the household.  Simulations, based on&#13;
econometric modeling indicate that abolishing school fees would raise the transition rate&#13;
from primary schools to junior secondary by 12%; subsidizing all school-related direct&#13;
costs would raise the rate by 32%, primarily bringing into school those children, whose&#13;
parents value education, but cannot afford to pay.&#13;
GOI is currently operating a nationwide scholarship program covering some&#13;
27,000 SLTP students. The scholarship consists of financial support amounting to RP&#13;
25,000 per month for twelve months, an ample amount to cover all SLTP-related costs.&#13;
A new fund distribution mechanism has recently been implemented, with funds being&#13;
distributed through the post office. The fund provides scholarships to children of low&#13;
economic background and satisfactory academic achievement and personality. Within&#13;
these criteria, preference is given to children from remote areas, orphans and girls. The&#13;
fund is operating well, and though very limited, is much appreciated.&#13;
It is proposed to expand the scholarship program to cover a much larger target&#13;
group in the project area, so as to make a greater impact in bringing poor children into&#13;
SLTP.  The current program would be augmented along the following lines: (a)&#13;
scholarships would be provided to 30,000 students in East Java and 5,350 for NTT; (b)&#13;
unit costs would be set at Rp 300,000 per student per year; and (c) a simple monitoring&#13;
mechanism will be implemented to make sure that recipients receive their full allocation&#13;
and that selection criteria are followed. By project mid-term review, the entire program&#13;
will be evaluated for impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
120                           Annex 16: Page 2 of 3&#13;
B. Selection Criteria For Scholarship Recipients&#13;
1. The candidate is in grade six of primary school or is a primary school graduate.&#13;
2. Priority will be given to Kecamatan or less developed areas with low gross enrollment&#13;
rates at junior secondary education or low primary-secondary transition rates.&#13;
3. Priority will be given to students from low economic background (refer to a letter of&#13;
reference from head of the village where the student lives), to orphans and to females.&#13;
4. Preference will be given to students with good academic achievement scores validated&#13;
by the school principal.&#13;
5. The student is not receiving any other scholarship.&#13;
6. Scholarships will be awarded annually, and can be extended upon satisfactory of the&#13;
recipient.&#13;
C. Scholarship Distribution and Monitoring System&#13;
1. In consultation with teacher or headmaster, eligible students will apply for scholarships&#13;
to the head of MOEC district office (Kakandep) or to the head of MOEC provincial&#13;
office (Kakanwil).&#13;
2. The selection, reviewing, and awarding will be performed by the Scholarship&#13;
Committee at the Kanwil Office.&#13;
3. The scholarship recipient will receive a monthly stipend for twelve consecutive&#13;
months, starting from July until June of the following year. Funds will be made&#13;
available through the post office nearest to his/her school.&#13;
4. Stipend amount will be defined by MOEC and must be agreed upon by the Bank.&#13;
5. Scholarship funds will be disbursed by the Provincial Project's account and sent to the&#13;
head of Provincial Giro Office account, who will make them available to the recipients&#13;
through the Post Office.&#13;
6. Post Offices will report back to the head of the Provincial Giro Office, who will report&#13;
back to the Provincial Project Manager.&#13;
&#13;

7. The effectiveness of the above distribution system will be monitored quarterly by&#13;
auditing the receipt forms filled out by the scholarship recipients. In addition, the&#13;
Scholarship Committee at Kanwil Office will monitor the system in the field by&#13;
interviewing a representative sample of scholarship recipients every year.&#13;
8. The above criteria would be applied according to an agreed weighted scoring system&#13;
using data from agreed sources.&#13;

Terns of Reference&#13;
Central Proeram Coordination Unit&#13;
Objectives. The Central Program Coordination Unit (CPCU) will have three&#13;
objectives: (a) it will monitor overall progress, and ensure that project implementation (as it&#13;
unfolds through the Annual Work Plan and Budget process) is in accordance with project&#13;
objectives and agreed project criteria, rules and guidelines; (b) it will guide the provinces and&#13;
provide (or locate the sources of) the necessary technical assistance to ensure that the project&#13;
implements as planned; and (c) it will cany out central program activities that may affect more&#13;
than one project.&#13;
Composition Existing staff in Dikmenum, augmented as necessary by project-&#13;
financed consultants will be at the core of the management team.&#13;
Tasks, Roles and Responsibilities. The Director of Dikmenum will head the Central&#13;
Program Coordination Unit and coordinate the overall program of expanding junior secondary&#13;
education. An important function of the Central Program Coordination Unit will be to monitor&#13;
implementation achievements in the different provinces through progress reports and&#13;
monitoring indicators and to keep the Government and the Bank informed in this respect.&#13;
Dikmenum's role as the national level program coordination unit will be distinctly&#13;
different from the roles of the provincial (Kanwil) offices. As a program coordinator, its role&#13;
will be that of oversight and facilitation -- not implementation. Dikmenum will therefore: (a)&#13;
ensure that provincial implementation focuses on achieving their agreed project objectives as&#13;
measured through the agreed project-specific monitoring indicators; (b) assist the provinces in&#13;
establishing appropriate annual work plans and monitor that these are carried out in accordance&#13;
with agreed priorities, criteria and procedures; (c) help ensure timely preparation of regional&#13;
project budgets (DIP); (d) assist in establishing appropriate management information systems&#13;
(both financial and substantive) for use at the Kanwil level as well as at the National level; (e)&#13;
disseminate information to the provinces in order to highlight promising regional approaches in&#13;
the design of Annual Work Plans and Budgets; and (f) identify or provide technical assistance&#13;
to the provinces to ensure compliance with agreed project-specific criteria, rules and&#13;
regulations.&#13;
Linkages to the Provincial Teams. Dikmenum will also help design and implement&#13;
national and provincial capacity building plans as the project unfolds. This will include assisting&#13;
the provinces establish appropriate project information systems and procedures on the principle&#13;
that relevant information from one system will feed into the next system, and that there will be&#13;
meaningful back and forth flow of information across administrative levels.&#13;

Provincial Proiect InWlementation Unit&#13;
Objectives. In order to get the project effectively implemented, the projects will be&#13;
executed through existing line authorities at the Kanwil level. There will be no expansion of&#13;
staff positions: existing positions will be used, and/or converted temporarily for project use as&#13;
and when necessary. Similarly, there will be no structural changes in the administrative system.&#13;
Team, Organization and Responsibilities. Project-specific task forces,&#13;
commensurate with the focus and specificity of each of the provincial projects will be&#13;
established as necessary. Each of these task forces will be composed of existing staff at the&#13;
Kanwil-level, and -- where appropriate -- at the Kandep level. These task forces will grow and&#13;
contract as necessary during project implementation.&#13;
KaKanwil in each Province will be responsible for project implementation. To lend a&#13;
focal point to the proposed implementation arrangements, a Provincial Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PPIU) under the overall leadership of KaKanwil, will be established in each Province.&#13;
This PPIU, managed by the head of the secondary education group (Kabid-Dikmenum) or a&#13;
Dikmenum staff memnber working under his/her supervision, will form the core of the proposed&#13;
implementation arrangement. The manager of the PPI will be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
management of the project and will report to KaKanwil on all matters pertaining to the project.&#13;
He/she will also keep the project authorities in Jakarta (Dikmenum) informed about progress,&#13;
including any events that threatened progress, such as the lack of human or financial resources&#13;
to resolve emerging problems. If necessary, one full-time monitoring officer and one or two&#13;
support staff will assist the manager of the PPIU in keeping track of implementation progress.&#13;
The PPIU will be assisted by a technical resource group in each province for the&#13;
duration of the project. The duties of this group, including that of consultants, will be to assist&#13;
in technical analysis of sector issues, prepare annual plans and detailed project designs,&#13;
troubleshoot on an ad-hoc basis, and conduct staff training/guidance. The technical resource&#13;
group will have access to other staff resources (including those from IKIPs/Universities) with&#13;
specialized project-related skills.&#13;
Tasks. Under the PPrU, there will typically be the following five divisions to carry out&#13;
the following functions: (a) Procurement and Civil Works; (b) Quality Improvement;&#13;
(c) Accounting; (d) Progress Monitoring; and (e) Supervision and Evaluation.&#13;
Relationship with the CPCU. Each Provincial Project Implementation Unit will&#13;
work in close liaison with the Central Program Coordination Unit in Jakarta. All official&#13;
project correspondence with the Bank will be channelled through DGPSE, except as&#13;
specifically delegated by the Director-General.&#13;
Advisory Committee. A Provincial Project Advisory Committee (see separate terms&#13;
of reference) will provide overall implementation guidance to the PPIU.&#13;

PROJECT PROGRESS MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    This Annex describes how project progress will be monitored and impact will be&#13;
evaluated. Reporting on monitoring and evaluation results will be done within the context of&#13;
Bank progress reporting. Project progress reporting will be on a semi-annual cycle. The half-&#13;
yearly progress report will cover the project status (physical progress, financial and&#13;
performance status) and will include status of the performance indicators. The program report&#13;
will be prepared in advance of the half-yearly Bank supervision missions. Details of progress&#13;
reporting are described here.&#13;
Project Monitoring Indicators&#13;
2.    Project status will be monitored through performance and output indicators (see&#13;
Annex 13). Project progress and performance will be monitored on the basis of several types&#13;
of indicators:&#13;
(a) Progress Monitoring Against the Implementation Plan&#13;
Annex 23 (Implementation Plan) gives information on the milestones, dates and tasks&#13;
to be carried out during the implementation process. At each supervision mission,&#13;
these will be reviewed, their status assessed, and the Plan updated to reflect progress.&#13;
The updated version of the Implementation Plan would indicate actual versus planned&#13;
implementation and show adjustments made accordingly.&#13;
(b) Ouantitative Indicators&#13;
In each progress report and at each supervision, the indicators as listed in Annex 13&#13;
will be reviewed. The actual against planned data will be filled out by the PIUs, and&#13;
will be discussed during supervision.&#13;
(c) Qualitative Indicators&#13;
At each supervision mission, an evaluation will be undertaken by the supervision&#13;
team of progress regarding qualitative indicators. The PIUs will mention, in the&#13;
progress report, the status of these indicators, which will then form the basis for the&#13;
supervision discussion. For each indicators, specific evidence of progress should be&#13;
provided.&#13;
&#13;

Format of Progress Report&#13;
3.    The half-yearly progress report should be organized in the following way and should&#13;
include the following sections:&#13;
(a) A narrative section describing progress of each of the components: Issues that&#13;
have arisen, problems, delays, suggested changes, decisions made in the last year should be&#13;
included for each relevant component.&#13;
(b) An update of the indicators: Actual status against planned implementation,&#13;
quantitative and qualitative indicators.&#13;
(c) A section listing the recommendations and agreements made during the last Bank&#13;
supervision mission and actions or present position.&#13;
(d) A list of all contract activities expected during the next year and half-year.&#13;
(e) A set of tables covering the following:&#13;
*  Expenditures to date (SAR plan and current status) shown by category of&#13;
expense and by component and status of civil works (number of contracts,&#13;
location, type of school covered and cost for each contract);&#13;
*  Training activities (SAR plan and current status): number and type of&#13;
training courses, number of participants, duration of each course, cost of&#13;
each course;&#13;
*  Status of Technical Assistance contracts (foreign and local): number of&#13;
person/months planned and currently used, costs of contracts and status of&#13;
disbursement.&#13;
(f) A report from the auditing consultants (whenever available).&#13;
Additional Reports and Reviews&#13;
4.     A few special reviews will also be carried out during project implementation, to further&#13;
support monitoring of progress. These reviews will be carried out by independent external&#13;
consultants and will be managed by the Project Coordination Unit in Dikmenum.&#13;
(a) Survey, in preparation for mid-term, to evaluated progress in improving management&#13;
skills and processes in Kanwils and Kandeps;&#13;
(b) Annually, a review of expenditures of government funds by private schools;&#13;
(c) Annually, monitoring of the effectiveness of the scholarship fund selection and&#13;
distribution; and&#13;
(d) At mid term, a review of the effectiveness of the contract teachers program.&#13;
Supervision Schedule&#13;
5.     Supervision missions will be held twice a year, during the project implementation period.&#13;
A planned mission schedule is listed in Annex 25. The mid-term review mission will consist of&#13;
a more thorough review; this mission will review overall progress since the beginning of the&#13;
implementation period, and will evaluate the need for adjustments or restructuring of the project&#13;
for the remainder of the project period.&#13;
&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL AUDITS&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    To ensure the accountability to the Government, the World Bank, the participant&#13;
communities and all stakeholders involved, a Technical Audit of the various project components&#13;
would be conducted annually (see para. 5.1 1). The goal of the technical audits would be to provide&#13;
impartial assessment of quality and efficiency of the methods and procedures employed by PIUs in&#13;
the provinces and the PCU at central MOEC in the implementation of the project and the impact of&#13;
this at school and administrative levels.&#13;
Team Composition, Qualification and Leadership&#13;
2.    Independence and Expertise. The technical audit would be carried out by independent&#13;
consultants with no association with the project and with qualifications and experience in: (a) the&#13;
operations and management of junior secondary schools, including open junior secondary schools;&#13;
(b) teacher training strategies and assessment; (c) use of library books and other educational&#13;
resources; (d) use of other instructional materials; (e) student examinations and performance&#13;
assessment strategies, techniques and dissemination; (f) location and adequacy of school&#13;
construction; (g) selection and management of scholarship program; (h) science education at junior&#13;
secondary level; (i) development of social marketing instruments; and (j) provincial, district, and&#13;
school management practices.&#13;
3.    Qualification of Team Members. The Technical Audit Team (TAT) members must&#13;
have the academic qualification and demonstrated expertise in one or more of the areas identified&#13;
above (para. 2). To this end, they would be required to submit: (a) a signed curriculum vitae, and&#13;
a copy of major diplomas; (b) a letter of acceptance to act as member of the TAT; and evidence of&#13;
no commitment to other job during the period of the contract.&#13;
4.     Team Leadership. Even though characterized by an interdisciplinary approach the&#13;
Technical Audit team would be required to have a leader to coordinate the operation, its efficiency&#13;
and quality of the final products.&#13;
Scope and Procedures&#13;
5.    The overall purpose of the technical audit is to identify those processes and outcomes&#13;
which are not easily captured by the annual missions or financial audits (which they are not&#13;
supposed to replace). The following activities can be mentioned as typical examples of the&#13;
concerns addressed by TAT: the educational interaction at classroom level and the best utilization&#13;
of teacher's time; what and how students are learning in classroom; how educational resource&#13;
materials are being used in everyday school life as a complement to classroom activities; the&#13;
development of the science education study in the selected. Their evaluation would be guided by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
156                              Annex 27: Page 2 of 3&#13;
would be guided by the project's performance indicators. schools of East Java and NTT; how and&#13;
with what results the "Open" SMP are working in the rural areas; what instruments (and with&#13;
what success) are being developed to implement the social marketing strategy.&#13;
Description of Tasks&#13;
6.     Regular and Open SMPs. The team would assess how effectively the different sizes of&#13;
regular SMPs operate in both the rural and urban areas, especially with reference to the types of&#13;
physical facilities and teachers provided to the schools. A detailed study of the open SMPs&#13;
would also be made to assess their effectiveness in providing junior secondary education, and to&#13;
identify the most appropriate ways of providing this type of education in a cost-effective manner.&#13;
7.     Teacher Training Strategies and Assessment. The team needs to assess how PKG&#13;
training has changed to incorporate lessons recently learned and new strategies developed to&#13;
ensure that delivery strategies are modified appropriately to fit variety of conditions in the project&#13;
provinces. These strategies could include the following points: the participation of headmasters&#13;
to the training undergone by their teachers as a requirement for better feedback, supervision and&#13;
assistance when back in school; the establishment of a follow-up process to make teacher training&#13;
a continuum rather than a one-shot operation; inclusion of instruction on textbook use and use of&#13;
the new instructional material (including the library) in the new training.&#13;
8.     Use of Educational Resources. Three types of books (reading, reference and&#13;
supplementary) are to be distributed under the project, and teachers and headmasters are expected&#13;
to participate in their selection. The TAT will verify that books distributed matched the&#13;
expressed choices of teachers and headmasters. Also, their adequacy in terms of attractiveness&#13;
and interest for young readers, as well as their actual uses by students and teachers, need to be&#13;
assessed by the TAT. This survey will include the reading material provided to SMP Terbuka,&#13;
and particularly their user friendliness. The use of educational technology for reference and&#13;
teaching would also be examined carefully to evaluate their potential use in the country.&#13;
9.     Use of Instructional Material. The TAT will survey the distribution of instructional&#13;
material to insure that teachers and headmasters were consulted prior to purchase, that the&#13;
received material met their expectation, and is effectively used in classroom activities. How the&#13;
use of this material is positively affecting student learning should be assessed in loco.&#13;
10.    Student Assessment System. The TAT will focus its analysis on how student&#13;
assessment is conducted in classroom, data reported to provincial level, and feedback provided&#13;
back to schools and classrooms for the benefit of each teacher and the corresponding students.&#13;
Analytical capacity at Kanwil level to study these data and managerial capacity to disseminate&#13;
them are key issues of interest, as well as the use of these assessments by teachers to change and&#13;
improve their teaching methods.&#13;
11.    Construction Site and Adequacy. For each province, the TAT will verify that schools,&#13;
and dormitories for students and teachers built under the project were consistent with the agreed&#13;
criteria for site selection. Adequacy of these constructions should be the object of observation&#13;
and dialogue with teachers, students and communities. Three- and six-classroom schools in the&#13;
rural areas constitute an innovation that deserves careful assessment by the TAT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 27: Page 3 of 3                             157&#13;
12.    Scholarship Program. The team will verify in their visits to schools that students were&#13;
awarded scholarships under the program according to agreed criteria and conditions, and&#13;
particularly the wide advertisement of the awarding processes. This will be done through a&#13;
review of sample award documents, documentation related to the flow of information among&#13;
concerned parties, and a spot check of recipients to ensure that the full scholarship is actually&#13;
received and used as intended.&#13;
13.    Science Education Study. The TAT will verify that the several components necessary&#13;
for the success of the study have been organized as specified in the detailed Terms of Reference&#13;
provided for the implementation of the study, and that consistency is maintained from year to&#13;
year. It will also ensure that the proper methodology is being followed for the analysis of final&#13;
data. The TAT will also evaluate the utility of the different packages of equipment provided to&#13;
the different categories of schools with respect to their contribution to improvements in science&#13;
teaching, cost, and ease of use, maintenance and replacement.&#13;
14.    Management Practices and Changes. The TAT will ensure that the proper staff are&#13;
receiving the technical and managerial training at provincial, district, and school levels, and that&#13;
trained staff receive posting consistent with their newly acquired skills. It will also ensure that&#13;
equipment provided under the project is actually used as intended.&#13;
Contract and Assistance&#13;
15.    A contract will be signed between the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) at Dikmenum&#13;
and the selected audit team for a month a year starting in 1997. The PCU will be responsible for&#13;
TAT's schedule and follow-up. In the provinces the two PIUs will provide the assistance&#13;
required for a timely and adequate schedule of visits and contacts, including remote project areas.&#13;
Duration and Expected Product&#13;
16.   The TAT will survey implementation's progress in the second, third and fourth years of&#13;
the project, and each survey is expected to be realized in a month. The TAT will provide its&#13;
report to the PCU, the PIUs and the World Bank for review and comments before issuing a final&#13;
document. The TAT will also ensure that implementation of recommendations issued by PCU or&#13;
the Bank after analysis of the progress reports are actually implemented in the following year.&#13;
The first audit shall not start before 18 months after the project started.&#13;

            Indonesia - East Java and East Nusa
            Tenggara Junior Secondary Education Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The East Java and East Nusa Tenggara
            Junior Secondary Education Project will assist the
            government of Indonesia in addressing the quality and
            coverage of junior secondary education (JSE) in the
            provinces of East Java and East Nusa Tenggara. The
            project's objectives are to: 1) expand access to JSE in
            a cost-effective and equitable way; 2) improve the teaching
            of JSE; and 3) strengthen the management capacity at all
            levels of the education system. The project comprises three
            major components: 1) access to JSE including: (a) increase
            in the number of places available at junior secondary level
            by adding classrooms to existing schools and building new
            schools located closer to the potential JSE demand; (b)
            provision of existing and new Open JSE with instructional
            material and training for tutors; (c) help to promising but
            poor students to get access to JSE through the expansion and
            improvement of the existing scholarship program; and (d)
            stimulation of the demand for JSE through a social marketing
            effort; 2) education quality consisting of: (a) provision of
            training to underqualified teachers; (b) teacher dormitories
            to insure the presence of teachers in remote areas; (c)
            construction of library rooms and provision of library
            books; (d) study of best teaching methods for science
            education; and (e) establishment of a Student Performance
            Assessment to provide teachers and principals with academic
            feedback; and 3) education management including: (a)
            expansion of the managerial skills of staff at central,
            provincial, district, sub-district and school levels; (b)
            improvement of the information management and utilization;
            and (c) augmentation of the equipment in province and
            district offices.
