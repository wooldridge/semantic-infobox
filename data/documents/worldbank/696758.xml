Note No.67   Are Bank Interest Rate Spreads Too High?&#13;
A simple model for decomposing spreads&#13;
F Montes-Negret  In the first seven months of 1995, average bank spreads in Ukraine ranged from 46 percentage&#13;
and Luca Papi    points to 84 percentage points (table 1). The size of these spreads might suggest that banks en-&#13;
joyed a wide profit margin. But inflation was high in Ukraine, and its banking system had large&#13;
stocks of nonperforming loans. Using a simplified model to make a "quick and dirty' estimate of&#13;
the spread banks need to achieve a positive real return on equity, this Note shows that nominal&#13;
spreads in Ukraine were on average below breakeven. The model can be adapted for use for any&#13;
country or for any bank or group of banks.&#13;

            inflation was high in Ukraine, and its banking system had

            situations and provide estimates of the effects of changes
            in the policy parameters of the size of the spreads.  It can
            be a handy guide to assess bank spreads for a given bank or
