                                  THE WORLD BANK&#13;
                                     April 18, 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:        Welcome back, Stephen. In our last meeting, we reviewed the work you did on the&#13;
&#13;
loan portfolio review, and I gather once that review was completed you stayed on with&#13;
&#13;
P&amp;B?&#13;
&#13;
A:        Thatâ&#128;&#153;s correct. I had been attached to the Programming &amp; Budgeting department in&#13;
&#13;
a formal way, but I really played no part in P&amp;B activities. But I was asked to stay on, for&#13;
&#13;
a year and a half as it turned out, because they felt that they needed more financial skills of&#13;
&#13;
one sort or another. This meant that I became a more formal part of P&amp;B. I was asked if I&#13;
&#13;
wanted to stay on the management side and take responsibility for the budget. My first&#13;
&#13;
brush with running the budget occurred at that time. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure who was running the&#13;
&#13;
budget at that time. John Adler was still the Director of the Department. But Joe Wood&#13;
&#13;
was there and Heinz Vergin, and John Blaxall who might have been back dealing with the&#13;
&#13;
budget.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        You were a Division Chief then?&#13;
&#13;
A:        Well, my assignment to the loan portfolio analysis was the equivalent of a division&#13;
&#13;
chief position. The question was whether I wanted to be in management or not. I wanted to&#13;
&#13;
return to operations, having done what I was recruited to do. I wished to return to the, to&#13;
&#13;
the fold, to Operations. Therefore, I initially declined any management job. But then they&#13;
&#13;
made Joe Wood an assistant director for finance, and so I said, well, if you want me to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 2&#13;
&#13;
stay, and you seem to want me to stay for a while, then I ainâ&#128;&#153;t staying for nothing less than&#13;
&#13;
Assistant Director. So that was done, and almost trapped me into finance for good because,&#13;
&#13;
as McNamara knew, and he said so in the end, there were no other opportunities at this&#13;
&#13;
level in the Bank, certainly not in operations.&#13;
&#13;
       I was used for all sorts of bits and pieces as well as just carrying on with the tail&#13;
&#13;
end of the loan portfolio analysis. I even wrote a budget document, because McNamara&#13;
&#13;
although he had taken his decisions didnâ&#128;&#153;t like the way it was written. So I rewrote the&#13;
&#13;
document over a weekend from front to finish. And I used to do bits and pieces for&#13;
&#13;
McNamara himself. He was always interested in getting data and doing a little analysis on&#13;
&#13;
his own and would use me to do that, sometimes to humorous effects. I can remember one&#13;
&#13;
occasion when he asked me to get certain data, which really surprised me because they&#13;
&#13;
were purely on the economic side of the business and had nothing to do with finance or the&#13;
&#13;
budget. When I was asked to get this data, I obviously went first to my contacts in the&#13;
&#13;
Economics complex, as it then was, to find out where would I get the data. I was surprised&#13;
&#13;
that we didn't have it in-house already, and I wondered where would be the right sort of&#13;
&#13;
sources and whether I needed to get somebody to do the work for me, only to find that&#13;
&#13;
McNamara had already been to the Chief Economist at that time and down the line asking&#13;
&#13;
for the same information. But the economic staff had refused to provide the information&#13;
&#13;
because they felt that McNamara was going to misuse the data. They had a sense as to&#13;
&#13;
what he wanted it for. So they advised me not to give him the information. I looked at their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 3&#13;
&#13;
objections and at what McNamara was going to do with the data, and then went back and&#13;
&#13;
told him he couldnâ&#128;&#153;t have the data. He took this in good spirit.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You donâ&#128;&#153;t remember what the context was?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No. I canâ&#128;&#153;t remember exactly what it was.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     He would call you up directly on these occasions?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. He would be very reasonable, in fact. John Adler used to upset me&#13;
&#13;
because McNamara would call and ask for some data, and heâ&#128;&#153;d ask John when he could&#13;
&#13;
have it. And this would be Friday afternoon at one oâ&#128;&#153;clock, and he would say: "Well, we&#13;
&#13;
could get you this by Saturday evening." And McNamara would say, "Thank you." Why&#13;
&#13;
not? And John would then turn to his people and find out the only way it could be got&#13;
&#13;
ready by Saturday evening was not only by people coming in on Saturday but spending&#13;
&#13;
most of Friday night in the office as well. When this was pointed out to him, he would not&#13;
&#13;
go back to McNamara ever. But as far as I knew, McNamara was not particularly difficult&#13;
&#13;
and would have understood that more time was needed to assemble the information. I can&#13;
&#13;
remember, I think it was exactly the time I was rewriting the budget, when he called me up&#13;
&#13;
and he said that he wanted me to write two pages to go into some speech which had to do&#13;
&#13;
with commercial bank lending to Latin America, which was of course a very hot topic in&#13;
&#13;
the mid-1970s. He then asked me: "When could I have it by?" And I looked at my&#13;
&#13;
calendar, this must have been on a Friday, and I said I thought I could finish this by close&#13;
&#13;
of business on the next Wednesday. And he said to me: "Oh! slightly sarcastic, implying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              3&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 4&#13;
&#13;
criticism of how long it took me, three days and a weekend, to write two pages of a speech.&#13;
&#13;
And I said that I was rewriting the budget, but that I could put that aside, of course, and&#13;
&#13;
then I could have the two pages of speech on Monday, but I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t do both at once. And&#13;
&#13;
his reaction was: "No, no, no. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve got it right. You do the budget and get that out by&#13;
&#13;
Tuesday, and Iâ&#128;&#153;ll be very happy to wait till Wednesday for my two pages of speech."&#13;
&#13;
        I always found him reasonable like that. Demanding in a proper way, but very&#13;
&#13;
understanding when things went wrong. His own life was so organized, which I think that&#13;
&#13;
was the thing that separated him out from the rest of us. His life was extremely well&#13;
&#13;
organized, although "well" is probably the wrong word, precisely organized that he made&#13;
&#13;
an agreement to have something, he really counted on it. If you told him that you were&#13;
&#13;
going to produce him a table on such and such, he would plot out that at 2:30 he would&#13;
&#13;
spend a quarter of an hour reading what you had. He would put it in his diary and at 2.45&#13;
&#13;
heâ&#128;&#153;d move on to something else. Now if your table wasnâ&#128;&#153;t there by 2:30, youâ&#128;&#153;d messed up&#13;
&#13;
his day because heâ&#128;&#153;d have to think of something else to do, and it wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be planned. I&#13;
&#13;
found that very interesting because if he asked to see you at 3:45, you went up to his office&#13;
&#13;
at 3:44, and youâ&#128;&#153;d say to his secretary: "Iâ&#128;&#153;m here," at least this is what I did the first time,&#13;
&#13;
later I didn't bother. You would say: â&#128;&#156;Could you let Mr. McNamara know that I'm&#13;
&#13;
present." And she would reply: "I don't have to announce you. You have an appointment&#13;
&#13;
at 3:45. As soon as it's 3:45, you just walk in, Don't knock." And that was the way it was.&#13;
&#13;
At 3:45, if you had an appointment at 3:45, you opened the door and you went in, and he&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                4&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 5&#13;
&#13;
would be expecting you, because he would know that you were coming, because heâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
&#13;
asked to see you, or youâ&#128;&#153;d asked to see him, or whatever it was, and that was that. He was&#13;
&#13;
very methodical in every respect. I remember once producing him a table, a single page&#13;
&#13;
table with data, and a call had come down saying would I come up at 3:45 to discuss this&#13;
&#13;
paper. So I walked in at 3:45 with my copy of the table, and McNamara is sitting behind&#13;
&#13;
his desk, he usually did his meetings around the table, and as I came in he looked up. He&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t say "hello," that would have been a waste of time, he would just move to his desk,&#13;
&#13;
and on the table I saw a copy of the one-page table sitting there. As he moved across the&#13;
&#13;
room from his desk to the table, he said: "Stephen, there is a figure in the fourth column,&#13;
&#13;
third row across, dealing with X. I did not understand why that figure was the way it was&#13;
&#13;
because I'd expected something else.â&#128;? He didnâ&#128;&#153;t have the paper in front of him and only&#13;
&#13;
when he'd got there did he look down at the paper to see what it was. And even though I'd&#13;
&#13;
worked on the paper, I had to tell him: "Bob, you'll have to let me look at my figures, I&#13;
&#13;
have no idea what's in the fourth column, third row across." So I had to take some time to&#13;
&#13;
refresh my memory. I don't think he was particularly intelligent. He wasn't stupid,&#13;
&#13;
obviously, but his real strength was, to my mind, this ability to concentrate solely on the&#13;
&#13;
subject at hand. He would not allow anybody to distract him from that very narrow focus&#13;
&#13;
on a subject matter. It was this that taught me after a couple of episodes to always ask him&#13;
&#13;
why he wanted certain information. Since he would ask for data in a very specific way and&#13;
&#13;
he'd get a very narrow answer if you didnâ&#128;&#153;t know the context. He didn't like footnotes, he&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              5&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 6&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t like nuances. If he asked you a question, he wanted an answer, just one answer. He&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t want ranges. He just wanted one answer. He might ask you three different things,&#13;
&#13;
and then make public statements to the Board or to the staff, based on these facts,&#13;
&#13;
sometimes not realizing that the things he was saying were actually contradictory in some&#13;
&#13;
way, because there were nuances that you were missing. He was using the data in a way&#13;
&#13;
that wasnâ&#128;&#153;t proper. In the Bank it might be the rate of growth of our lending for poverty,&#13;
&#13;
and then he would ask another question in some other direction, and yet another question&#13;
&#13;
in some other direction, all separate and addressed to different people. Now, when youâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
&#13;
add them all together youâ&#128;&#153;d see that they were just not consistent, because the data had&#13;
&#13;
been supplied to him in each case without understanding the context in which they were to&#13;
&#13;
be used and the necessary caveats and footnotes. He did not seem to be able to see the&#13;
&#13;
connection between these things. I would not concentrate quite so much on the specific&#13;
&#13;
data, I would never focus as intensely as he was on the thing, but I was able to see, as did&#13;
&#13;
many other people, Joe Wood, for example, the connection between things. We would&#13;
&#13;
therefore try to warn him not to use the data without qualifications. Still, I got burned a&#13;
&#13;
couple of times by having my data not used properly. If Iâ&#128;&#153;d known the way he was going to&#13;
&#13;
use my figures, I would have warned him that the data werenâ&#128;&#153;t good enough for that&#13;
&#13;
purpose, or if thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way he was going to use the information, it was important to hedge&#13;
&#13;
the conclusions. So I started every time he asked me for data, even if it was very simple&#13;
&#13;
data, by asking: "What do you need it for?" And his answer to me nearly always was:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               6&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
"Whatâ&#128;&#153;s that got to do with you?" Very nicely, but that was basically the message, "Why&#13;
&#13;
do I have to tell you why I want the data? I want to know the price of eggs." Now, I might&#13;
&#13;
say, well, you want them to sell? You want them to buy? You want them to retail or&#13;
&#13;
wholesale? Or what are you going to do with the price of eggs? So in the end, he got used&#13;
&#13;
to the idea that if he wanted me to get the data, then he had to tell me what he wanted it for,&#13;
&#13;
otherwise I wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t get it for him. And if he wanted the data without any questions asked,&#13;
&#13;
then heâ&#128;&#153;d have to ask somebody else. Which is of course exactly the kind of thing that had&#13;
&#13;
happened to me in the episode when he wanted me to provide some economic data. The&#13;
&#13;
people in the economic complex had found out what he wanted the information for and&#13;
&#13;
told him that the data wasn't relevant to his purpose and therefore he shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t use it&#13;
&#13;
because it's not accurate. So he turned around and asked me to get the same data, without&#13;
&#13;
telling me what it was for.&#13;
&#13;
       Generally he was very impressive in certain ways, but you could also see his&#13;
&#13;
weaknesses. The intensity of his thought and his analysis on a particular issue was clearly&#13;
&#13;
impressive, but there was a lack of breadth of looking at that issue. Which was&#13;
&#13;
extraordinary because the breadth of his own mind was phenomenal. But he'd concentrate&#13;
&#13;
on each little piece of the picture, one by one, instead of taking a broad view of the whole&#13;
&#13;
while examining the detail. His mind would be quite interesting to slice up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              7&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 8&#13;
&#13;
Q:     But there was also this obsession with numbers, everything has to be reduced to&#13;
&#13;
numbers, I understand. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always thought that this must be because his mind and his&#13;
&#13;
memory is sort of geared to operate in quantitative terms?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, he was an accounting type of person in his "Whiz Kid" days, and he liked&#13;
&#13;
precision in numbers, which was, in my mind, one of his big fallacies. If the question was,&#13;
&#13;
for example, what the price of tea was going to be in 10 yearsâ&#128;&#153; time, any normal person&#13;
&#13;
would say: "I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what the price of tea is going to be in 10 yearsâ&#128;&#153; time. These are&#13;
&#13;
the factors which will affect the price of tea, and if you want my guess, that is no better&#13;
&#13;
than a guess at the moment, I think things are going to develop this way and the price of&#13;
&#13;
tea may be Â£750 a ton. But don't hold me to that because here is a long list of my caveats&#13;
&#13;
and the outcome will vary depending on a whole range of factors.â&#128;? He didn't like that. He&#13;
&#13;
would want a figure, the price of tea in X years was going to be Â£750, not 550 to 850, but&#13;
&#13;
750. I think he felt, and I think this was a genuine feeling in his part, that giving ranges of&#13;
&#13;
figures conveyed a lack of intellectual rigor. You hadn't thought the problem through,&#13;
&#13;
therefore you had no choice but to give him a range. Whereas if you really thought it&#13;
&#13;
through, you had to come up with one figure.&#13;
&#13;
       The strange thing about his mind also was that he could absorb and understand a&#13;
&#13;
mass of figures. He liked tables with numbers; he did not get as much out of a graph which&#13;
&#13;
would represent those figures. Most people seem to me to be the other way around, it's&#13;
&#13;
that they find it very difficult to grasp a matrix of figures, and if you can find a good way&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               8&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 9&#13;
&#13;
of putting them into a graph it becomes instantly obvious to them what you are talking&#13;
&#13;
about. He was the other way. He would not have graphs. It was always tables. He would&#13;
&#13;
look at a set of tables and see that this lot was growing faster than that lot. Most people&#13;
&#13;
would not be able to do that. Youâ&#128;&#153;d have to have a graph to illustrate the point. Not&#13;
&#13;
everybody would get that out of a list of tables. He would. And the graph, he would say,&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t mean anything to him.&#13;
&#13;
       So I found him quite a fascinating person to watch and to work with. He was&#13;
&#13;
unfailingly generous as an individual. He might have been occasionally a little sarcastic,&#13;
&#13;
but not very much. He was quite demanding although not in a rough way. I never saw him&#13;
&#13;
talk badly to anybody. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure it must have happened, because we are all like that, but I&#13;
&#13;
never heard him bad-mouth anybody, except perhaps on the budget. I was puzzled by all&#13;
&#13;
this phenomenal over-precision that we used in preparing the budget. Everything would be&#13;
&#13;
done precisely, but the question, why do pick one figure for this Vice Presidency and&#13;
&#13;
another one for that Vice Presidency, remained unanswered. Everything looked terribly&#13;
&#13;
precise, but what was the basis for the judgment that this was how much you were going to&#13;
&#13;
put in Agriculture, and this was how much you were going to put into the South Asia&#13;
&#13;
region versus the West Africa region? McNamara did admit to me once, which I found&#13;
&#13;
him quite appealing at that stage and it made me begin to think that the guy was more&#13;
&#13;
human than I had thought, he admitted: "Well, I decided this allocation because Mr. X will&#13;
&#13;
use the money wisely and Mr. Y will waste it." I thought: â&#128;&#156;hurrah!â&#128;? that's exactly right,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              9&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 10&#13;
&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way I would have done it myself. He virtually said, that if a particular vice&#13;
&#13;
president asked him for any money, he wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t even necessarily ask him what it was for,&#13;
&#13;
he would just give it to him, because he knew would have a good use for it and it wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
be wasted.&#13;
&#13;
       So I was quite happy with my assignment to P&amp;B once I had reached a modus&#13;
&#13;
vivendi in my work for McNamara, not that I would want to give the wrong impression&#13;
&#13;
that I saw him every day, I was just a tiny element in his entourage there. But I did one&#13;
&#13;
interesting job during my time in P&amp;B before I went back to operations. This was a very&#13;
&#13;
interesting episode which has never gotten any publicity. It was a study of the attitudes of&#13;
&#13;
the major commercial banks who were greatly exposed in Third World countries. You&#13;
&#13;
remember the tremendous lending to Brazil and Mexico in the 1970s. Everyone was&#13;
&#13;
getting very worried about their exposure, although not in the way that we now realize they&#13;
&#13;
should have got worried, namely about the debt burden of these countries becoming too&#13;
&#13;
great. That had worried us a great deal in the loan portfolio analysis unit, and I think one of&#13;
&#13;
the side issues of our analysis was that we got the economics people to set standards for&#13;
&#13;
economic work which were a little better than they were before we started. We tried to get&#13;
&#13;
them to take into account a lot more factors that affected a countryâ&#128;&#153;s creditworthiness than&#13;
&#13;
they had previously. We had a whole section on how economic analysis could be&#13;
&#13;
improved and practices which are standard today were introduced about then.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              10&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 11&#13;
&#13;
       The thing that worried us a lot was whether these commercial banks were going to&#13;
&#13;
back off now at the top of their lending and cut back, because at the time people were&#13;
&#13;
seriously talking in the press about commercial banks cutting back on their debt in Latin&#13;
&#13;
America. Our worry was whether this would create a major problem for these banks,&#13;
&#13;
because the problem, as you will recall, was not necessarily that they had lent, although&#13;
&#13;
that was a problem because much of the lending was without proper purpose, much of it&#13;
&#13;
was just for consumption or projects of some doubtful kind. For example, there had been a&#13;
&#13;
$250 million loan that was put together for Zaire by Citibank, just to stay in business. The&#13;
&#13;
problem was that almost all of this money was on short term, one-year, two-year, maybe&#13;
&#13;
up to five-year loans, these were not 10-, 15-, 20-year loans which are the kind appropriate&#13;
&#13;
for these countries. This meant that the banks had to do a tremendous amount of new&#13;
&#13;
lending simply to maintain their portfolio and to prevent a net out-flow of capital. It&#13;
&#13;
worried us a great deal, that the point was coming when the banks were going to stop and&#13;
&#13;
retrench, and like lemmings they would all follow each other, causing the collapse which&#13;
&#13;
they were concerned about.&#13;
&#13;
       The banks, of course, were recycling the Saudi oil money. The Saudis, when we&#13;
&#13;
tried to get them to lend directly to the developing countries said: "Why should we take the&#13;
&#13;
risk and expose ourselves in the Third World countries, which we do not think are going to&#13;
&#13;
be in a position to repay? We will give our money to these nice, solid Western bank&#13;
&#13;
institutions and let them take the risk. Theyâ&#128;&#153;ll owe us the money, and they are a better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              11&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 12&#13;
&#13;
credit risk." They gave up some of the potentially high returns they could have earned, but&#13;
&#13;
this was the very sensible and cautious approach followed by the Saudis and the other oil&#13;
&#13;
producers; they were looking to the commercial banks to get their money back. So we were&#13;
&#13;
very worried that some reversal could take place and that the banks just by deciding to stop&#13;
&#13;
any further lending would cause absolute chaos.&#13;
&#13;
       So I was dispatched, sometimes with John Adler, sometimes on my own, to&#13;
&#13;
virtually all the major banks in the world, except I think in Japan at that stage. We went to&#13;
&#13;
all the big banks in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, L.A., Ottawa, Europe, all around&#13;
&#13;
the European capitals. What we were asking these people was, what are you intending to&#13;
&#13;
do. We told them about our concern and that we simply wanted to know, because we&#13;
&#13;
needed to be on top of things; if there was going to be trouble we needed to know about it&#13;
&#13;
because we needed to plan for it. We were asking Citibank, for instance: you have been&#13;
&#13;
expanding at 10 percent a year, do you intend to continue to expand your portfolio in these&#13;
&#13;
countries at 10 percent a year? Do you differentiate by country more than you did before?&#13;
&#13;
And with varying degrees of reluctance, but mostly very willingly, they gave us their&#13;
&#13;
views on the condition that their response would not be identified in the final report and&#13;
&#13;
that they would get a copy of the final report, so that they could see how they fitted within&#13;
&#13;
the overall picture.&#13;
&#13;
       It was quite fascinating because as we went around and began to get more and more&#13;
&#13;
of the picture, we were able to tell the next people we were interviewing what the results&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             12&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
were beginning to show. So we found people like Citibank, who were at that stage really&#13;
&#13;
planning not to cut back the actual portfolio but to restrict its growth to practically nothing;&#13;
&#13;
they were prepared to turn it over, but the idea of net new money for them was over. But&#13;
&#13;
then there were others like Wells-Fargo and Security Pacific, who were fairly new to the&#13;
&#13;
game. They were beginning to grow in domestic banking terms, and they were hell-bent&#13;
&#13;
on building up their overseas portfolio because they felt they needed to catch up. And we&#13;
&#13;
found that all over the place.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I guess Bank of America was part of your sample?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Bank of America was in and was one of the ones that was a bit over-exposed. But I&#13;
&#13;
canâ&#128;&#153;t remember now whether that wasnâ&#128;&#153;t the one that was still fairly gung-ho. Either the&#13;
&#13;
Bank of America or Citibank - they were both heavily exposed - was beginning to be very&#13;
&#13;
cautious, while the other one was still gung-ho, but I canâ&#128;&#153;t remember exactly which one&#13;
&#13;
that was now.&#13;
&#13;
       When we added it all up, we found that there were some banks who were willing to&#13;
&#13;
increase their portfolios in these types of countries by as much as 15 percent over the next&#13;
&#13;
year. Others were zero, and occasionally one was trying to get out, but get out very slowly&#13;
&#13;
so that nobody else would notice because otherwise that could be big trouble. The overall&#13;
&#13;
effect was that the portfolio was going to increase slightly and therefore there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t going&#13;
&#13;
to be a major problem in that respect despite all the noise about being over-exposed. I&#13;
&#13;
suspect that by circulating this report with these results in it to all the banks concerned,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               13&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 14&#13;
&#13;
they took a certain amount of comfort in the fact that those who were expanding were not&#13;
&#13;
alone, and that they were not going to be left out there all alone if they were increasing&#13;
&#13;
their portfolio when everybody else was trying to minimize their exposure. So to a certain&#13;
&#13;
extent the results of the report became a self-fulfilling prophesy and to a certain extent one&#13;
&#13;
was doing something by accident which the banks themselves were not really supposed to&#13;
&#13;
do, which would have been against the antitrust laws. Obviously, we did not write the&#13;
&#13;
report for that purpose, but when I look back, I think we probably did the banks a great&#13;
&#13;
service, or, if you will, a great disservice because they expanded their portfolios even&#13;
&#13;
further.&#13;
&#13;
Q:         Now this was a one-year exercise. I suppose you should have repeated this&#13;
&#13;
exercise on an annual basis.&#13;
&#13;
A:         Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. But I left, and then anyway the whole thing began to unravel not long&#13;
&#13;
after that.&#13;
&#13;
Q:         The one thing that triggered the debt crisis was the relentless increase in interest&#13;
&#13;
rates which was quite obvious?&#13;
&#13;
A:         Right. The interest rates were all short-term, and even the five-year loans were&#13;
&#13;
done on LIBOR base so that they werenâ&#128;&#153;t even fixed for five years. The pass-through of the&#13;
&#13;
rate increases was very quick.&#13;
&#13;
           In some ways I was quite happy about the outcome of the study. It was very&#13;
&#13;
interesting and very informative and turned out to be very accurate. But at the same time,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 14&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 15&#13;
&#13;
looking back now, one feels that one did oneâ&#128;&#153;s tiny little bit to in a sense make the debt&#13;
&#13;
situation worse. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure it would have happened anyway, I tell myself, but sometimes one&#13;
&#13;
does get a little queasy feeling at having done something that led to the encouragement of&#13;
&#13;
further lending.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Whose idea was the study? Was that McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s idea?&#13;
&#13;
A:     I think so. Yes. Certainly the concern was his. How we went about it was very&#13;
&#13;
much my own idea. In the planning he didnâ&#128;&#153;t say: "Go around to all these banks," but he&#13;
&#13;
must have expressed his concern in terms of: "I feel very uneasy not knowing what these&#13;
&#13;
guys are going to do." Presumably, he asked in one of his data collection exercises, what&#13;
&#13;
the banks were going to do and what their exposure was going to be at the end of the year.&#13;
&#13;
And, of course, nobody knew the answer.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I always think that if he had been here in â&#128;&#153;82, that he wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have been caught as&#13;
&#13;
much by surprise as everybody else was caught.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. I would think so too. I would have thought so. Whether he would have&#13;
&#13;
taken the right actions or not remains a question, but he would not have been taken by&#13;
&#13;
surprise. He did think about those things.&#13;
&#13;
       Anyway, it was a very interesting exercise, and it also led to one or two other&#13;
&#13;
things. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether I told you this story, when we were talking about the loan&#13;
&#13;
portfolio analysis unit. When I did that exercise I think I mentioned that I went around to&#13;
&#13;
various banks. This was when I first started the job to find out how they did their own&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              15&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 16&#13;
&#13;
portfolio analysis. This, of course, was how I got entrees to many of these banks so easily&#13;
&#13;
at the end, even though I was still very young. Usually when we were trying to find out&#13;
&#13;
what the banks were planning, we were talking with the president and the chairman or&#13;
&#13;
someone close to that sort of level because nobody else would make the sort of&#13;
&#13;
commitments we were talking about, and was able to give a good picture in half an hour or&#13;
&#13;
an hour of discussion.&#13;
&#13;
       Iâ&#128;&#153;d been around to a number of these banks earlier to find out how they did&#13;
&#13;
portfolio analysis. When I started the portfolio analysis unit was, that we are a civil service&#13;
&#13;
type bank which hasnâ&#128;&#153;t done so much of this, since we tend to rely on the judgment of our&#13;
&#13;
economists. What we really wanted to find out was how those real guys out there, who&#13;
&#13;
lend real money and who can actually go broke by making the wrong loans, how they go&#13;
&#13;
about analyzing their loan portfolio. Credit analysis was their strength, thought I. So&#13;
&#13;
before I developed my own approach with Chandra, I went around to all these banks and&#13;
&#13;
asked them to tell me how they did it. I wanted to learn. Right? I wanted to gain a good&#13;
&#13;
understanding. I would tell them what we did and how our analysis was all isolated&#13;
&#13;
country by country, and how we didnâ&#128;&#153;t tie the results together to cover the entire portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
Well, the answer was, of course, which won't surprise you, that those guys didn't do that&#13;
&#13;
either. They had very crude yardsticks, like they would never lend more than X percent to&#13;
&#13;
the auto industry, however strong the auto industry was. The idea was simply, don't&#13;
&#13;
concentrate your portfolio in one industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              16&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 17&#13;
&#13;
       But the matter came to a head with Fanny Mae, who I went to see in the course of&#13;
&#13;
my travels. I said, I knew more or less what their portfolio was outside the U.S. That&#13;
&#13;
information was not always easy to come by. I mean, in those days you would read the&#13;
&#13;
annual report and you did not necessarily get clear facts as to where the money was&#13;
&#13;
invested, because they didnâ&#128;&#153;t have to produce the information and they didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to&#13;
&#13;
produce it. I also learned as an aside that one of their principal reasons for keeping short&#13;
&#13;
their loans to one and two years, was not because they really felt that they had to be able to&#13;
&#13;
have the opportunity to get the money back. Most of the banks realized that if they tried to&#13;
&#13;
take all that money back they wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be able to get it. Therefore in effect, even though&#13;
&#13;
they were signing one-year or two-year loan agreements, they reckoned that they were&#13;
&#13;
there for 10 or 15 years. But they would never sign 10- or 15-year agreements. Why?&#13;
&#13;
Because they could put into their annual reports for the general public: â&#128;&#156;Don't worry about&#13;
&#13;
the money we've got abroad because it's all there on short term. We can get it back very&#13;
&#13;
quickly.â&#128;? Which, of course, they knew was untrue. That was a real eye-opener for me who&#13;
&#13;
had not dealt with commercial banks.&#13;
&#13;
       When I went to Fanny Mae and said: "I understand you've got, something like 50 to&#13;
&#13;
60 percent of your loan assets invested overseas," the answer was: "That's about right."&#13;
&#13;
Then I asked: "How many economists have you got working on the United States?" And&#13;
&#13;
the answer was: "About 95." "How many economists have you got working on your&#13;
&#13;
portfolio outside the United States?" This included Japan and Europe, I mean, this was not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              17&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 18&#13;
&#13;
LDC money, it was just overseas money. And the answer then was: "About five." So I&#13;
&#13;
said: "Well, that seems a bit odd. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve got 95 on the U.S. and five on the non-U.S., and&#13;
&#13;
your portfolios are spread 50-50. Why is that?" The answer was, of course, that they had&#13;
&#13;
data for the U.S., therefore they had something for the economists to analyze, and on the&#13;
&#13;
foreign side, particularly outside the Japans and Europe, they did not have data and&#13;
&#13;
therefore there was nothing to analyze.&#13;
&#13;
       So, one of the most interesting discussions I had with them the next day was when I&#13;
&#13;
told them that they seemed to do things completely the wrong way around. I told them if&#13;
&#13;
they were interested in the analysis of U.S. data they could probably get by without doing&#13;
&#13;
any of your own, because you could buy the analysis of any industry without any problem&#13;
&#13;
whatsoever and be reasonably certain that it was sensible and good. But you could not do&#13;
&#13;
that for the foreign stuff, because there were no data, and, therefore, that was where they&#13;
&#13;
had to keep their eye on the ground and needed their own people to do the work because&#13;
&#13;
they might get absolutely the wrong picture. I told them that I thought if they had only got&#13;
&#13;
somebody here looking at what was published in Brazil, they were not likely to know what&#13;
&#13;
was happening, and that they need people in Brazil to understand what the hell was going&#13;
&#13;
on in Brazil. I think that conversation had quite an impact on them in terms of looking at&#13;
&#13;
their own approach. Of course, the fellow I talked to got a little worked up about that and&#13;
&#13;
started switching things around. But it was quite interesting and educational for me.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did you keep in touch with these people?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             18&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 19&#13;
&#13;
A:      For a while, yes. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve lost contact now. By the time I got back to the Treasury in&#13;
&#13;
the â&#128;&#153;90s or the late â&#128;&#153;80s the people had totally changed. This was, well, 10 or 15 years later.&#13;
&#13;
I came across the odd person who Iâ&#128;&#153;d seen there, but the people I met then were very senior&#13;
&#13;
there at that time, and of course they'd all gone, and I didnâ&#128;&#153;t have working contacts at the&#13;
&#13;
bottom end which would have grown with me. So, my earlier involvement wasn't very&#13;
&#13;
useful in that respect.&#13;
&#13;
        The other thing that I planned to work on was an idea of Peter Cargill's which was&#13;
&#13;
quite fascinating. This was what really kept me and made me agree to stay this extra year&#13;
&#13;
in the first place. This survey of commercial banks just happened to arise. But the reason&#13;
&#13;
for my staying was that we needed another capital increase, and the capital increase was by&#13;
&#13;
no means certain. It was going to be quite large. I think that was perhaps the one which&#13;
&#13;
ended up by doubling the size of the Bank again in terms of capital. This was Joe Wood's&#13;
&#13;
principal assignment at that time. There were a lot of the questions then, really of the kind&#13;
&#13;
that were being asked about the vision statement 15 years later. Questions of the kind: why&#13;
&#13;
were we doing things the way we were? What was our role in the Bank? Should we be&#13;
&#13;
even lending to places like Mexico and Brazil? Should we be rethinking our role in&#13;
&#13;
support of the private sector? The whole works, everything was being questioned. Every&#13;
&#13;
borrower and every Part I country had different types of questions about what sort of&#13;
&#13;
things we should be doing and whether the Articles of Agreement should be changed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              19&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 20&#13;
&#13;
        So Peter Cargill decided that if we were going to get a capital increase, we had to&#13;
&#13;
address all these issues up front. And he had a plan that he was going to mastermind this,&#13;
&#13;
on behalf of McNamara, but it was Peterâ&#128;&#153;s plan for sure. He was going to get four people to&#13;
&#13;
run this thing for him, and they were not going to do it all themselves but they would then&#13;
&#13;
mobilize the Bank to do a major review of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s purposes from bottom up. What we&#13;
&#13;
were to do, in fact, was to visit the capitals of all the Part I countries that mattered, to find&#13;
&#13;
out virtually every single issue that they had with the Bank at that time. There were&#13;
&#13;
substantial problems, because the Bank had been growing so fast and McNamara was&#13;
&#13;
controversial in many ways. We were supposed to get their views on what we should be&#13;
&#13;
doing and what we should not be doing. Weâ&#128;&#153;d go to countries like India, Nigeria and Brazil&#13;
&#13;
to find out from scratch what they expected from the Bank, and what their problems were&#13;
&#13;
with the way we were doing our business. We would analyze these complaints on the one&#13;
&#13;
hand, and visions for the future on the other, and would come up with a major conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
On this basis we would make recommendations about the changes we wanted in the&#13;
&#13;
policies and practices of the Bank. The bottom line was, that this was the only way we&#13;
&#13;
were going to get the capital increase and a Bank of the size that McNamara wanted.&#13;
&#13;
        I was one of the four people. The four people that Peter picked were Joe Wood and&#13;
&#13;
I to be joint chairmen of the study, with David Bock and Chandra Hardy being the two&#13;
&#13;
division chief level people beneath that. We formed the core group without any staff&#13;
&#13;
directly working for us, with Peter as the guiding spirit of the exercise, and with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                20&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 21&#13;
&#13;
McNamara in the background. We would mobilize the Bank to do the necessary staff&#13;
&#13;
work, while we were providing the design and the supervision. We were moving right&#13;
&#13;
along when we were coming up to the elections in November of â&#128;&#153;76. Carter was beating&#13;
&#13;
Ford and the Democrats moved back into the White House. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll never forget the morning,&#13;
&#13;
sometime not too far ahead of the election, it must have been in September, when we had&#13;
&#13;
this meeting with McNamara and he said: "Listen to this line of thinking, and tell me what&#13;
&#13;
you think. If on November 2 Ford wins, whoâ&#128;&#153;s going to be the Secretary of the Treasury?"&#13;
&#13;
The answer would be, William Simon, the same one we had. Then he would ask: "Do you&#13;
&#13;
see any prospects of getting a capital increase out of William Simon, however good a job&#13;
&#13;
you may do of rationalizing all sorts of things, and however much attention we pay to the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. complaints?â&#128;? The answer was, everybody agreed, a hard row, and probably we&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't succeed. Then he said: "Fine. Thank you. Now, let me tell you about Carter." Of&#13;
&#13;
course, we didn't know anything about Carter, and I don't think he knew much about him&#13;
&#13;
either. But he said: "The one thing you can be sure, if Carter wins, all the key positions of&#13;
&#13;
the Federal Government will be held by my friends, the people that I worked with when I&#13;
&#13;
was in the government. Those people, if Carter wins, can be relied on to deliver me a&#13;
&#13;
capital increase regardless of whether I make a good case or not. So, why go through all&#13;
&#13;
this trouble? You'll open up a whole can of worms, we'll never be able to close it down&#13;
&#13;
again, we'll ask all these questions about the future of the Bank, and it's not going to do us&#13;
&#13;
a bit of good. We'll be sorry, if Carter comes in, that we got into all these issues. We'll get&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              21&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 22&#13;
&#13;
our money anyway if Carter comes in. Weâ&#128;&#153;ll also be sorry if we did it if Ford wins, because&#13;
&#13;
we are probably going to give him more ammunition to do exactly what he wants to do&#13;
&#13;
now, which is not allow us to expand." And he concluded: "Stop the whole exercise. Itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
finished." That was that. So it all came to a grinding halt. I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t fault the reasoning&#13;
&#13;
which led to the end of our assignment, but I was very disappointed. This assignment&#13;
&#13;
seemed to me absolutely fascinating thing to do and, I think, it would have been the right&#13;
&#13;
thing to do in the interest of the long-term future of the Bank. We should have addressed&#13;
&#13;
many of those issues because they are still lurking around in many ways now. But we&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t, because of short-term tactical considerations. And, as I said, one couldnâ&#128;&#153;t fault the&#13;
&#13;
argument. It was very realpolitik and an accurate assessment. In the event, Carter did get in&#13;
&#13;
and we did get our money without any fuss, that capital increase was not difficult at all.&#13;
&#13;
       Thatâ&#128;&#153;s when I said, this is a dead loss, I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to stay here in P&amp;B. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t even&#13;
&#13;
want to finish my year. Then I got involved in this commercial bank survey and a number&#13;
&#13;
of other matters to fill in the time, but I began to get very itchy because I really didnâ&#128;&#153;t want&#13;
&#13;
to stay there as a long-term career. So I determined there and then that I was going to leave&#13;
&#13;
because there was nothing to do.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now, two questions. First, you said that this was something that Peter had initiated.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     But you werenâ&#128;&#153;t sure that McNamara might have been behind this.&#13;
&#13;
A:     I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether he was behind it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               22&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 23&#13;
&#13;
Q:     But Peter must have reported to him, so that McNamara was closely involved from&#13;
&#13;
the outset. In other words, McNamara reversed himself when he decided to abandon the&#13;
&#13;
studies?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Oh, yes. Oh, absolutely. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t react this way the first time he heard of it. He&#13;
&#13;
either originated the thinking and told Peter thatâ&#128;&#153;s what he wanted to do, or he reacted&#13;
&#13;
positively to Peterâ&#128;&#153;s suggestion that we do this. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know which of those two. But it&#13;
&#13;
was certainly McNamara, who put a stop to it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     But this would indicate that he focused on the tactical concerns only as the exercise&#13;
&#13;
proceeded?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. He always felt he could manage everything, of course.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now, my second question. How was your study related to the complex of studies&#13;
&#13;
that was referred to as the "Future of the Bank"?&#13;
&#13;
A:     We had nothing to do with that. That must have been later, a separate exercise.&#13;
&#13;
Although my memory fails me because Iâ&#128;&#153;d left by the time these studies were done. But I&#13;
&#13;
think the were inspired by the same capital increase. However, instead of going into the&#13;
&#13;
depth that we did and really open everything, including the Articles of Agreement, these&#13;
&#13;
studies just speculated about the future of the Bank. There were no surveys of outside&#13;
&#13;
opinion, the concerns of our shareholders. in that respect, but these papers were designed&#13;
&#13;
to get us through with a minimum number of fuss. You didnâ&#128;&#153;t ask anybody. What these&#13;
&#13;
studies addressed were those issues which were on the table already and which somebody&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             23&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4118/95, Page 24&#13;
&#13;
was making a fuss about. And if the person who was making the fuss wasn't very&#13;
&#13;
influential to attract the attention of the major donors, then that was not included. But when&#13;
&#13;
this exercise got started, I had gone and I did not participate in any of those studies.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      You had made it clear that you wanted to go back into Operations, and did go back&#13;
&#13;
to Operations in '77?&#13;
&#13;
A:      It took me about six or seven months to extricate myself. McNamara, when I said I&#13;
&#13;
wanted to go, said that I could not go and that I was needed in the P&amp;B complex. I said to&#13;
&#13;
him: "It's all very well for you to say that, but there isn't actually anything for me to do." I&#13;
&#13;
mean, it was nice to be around and I was flattered to be asked to stay, but what was there&#13;
&#13;
for me to do. There was Joe Wood, who's extremely competent, to run the day-to-day shop.&#13;
&#13;
Then, at first, I got the commercial bank assignment and perhaps there could have been a&#13;
&#13;
couple of others of that nature. But it really wasn't very satisfying because I didn't have&#13;
&#13;
any career focus. And then McNamara let me know through John Adler that there weren't&#13;
&#13;
any 27 Level jobs around . The only 27 level jobs in Operations were the chief economists,&#13;
&#13;
which I clearly was not qualified to take. Then there were assistant directors on the projects&#13;
&#13;
side, but I hadn't even been a division chief and could hardly move straight into one of&#13;
&#13;
those jobs. John Blaxall had in the meantime made his exit from P&amp;B , where he was made,&#13;
&#13;
as you know, Deputy Director when he was still a YP. He had never managed to budge&#13;
&#13;
from there and finally made a lateral shift to a region as an assistant director, I think Latin&#13;
&#13;
America,&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        RESTRICTED&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       So for me to get out, I had to say to McNamara in the end that I accepted that there&#13;
&#13;
would be no job at my level open in Operations. Why should anybody take me as Assistant&#13;
&#13;
Director, if I had no experience as a division chief in Operations. I'd missed it for some&#13;
&#13;
reason; and I said I thought I'd like to enjoy an assignment as division chief. I decided&#13;
&#13;
that I was going to get myself a division chiefs job, and if that meant giving up the grade&#13;
&#13;
I'd had for the last year, well, too bad! At that stage McNamara shrugged his shoulders and&#13;
&#13;
sighed and said to me: "If you are prepared to make that sacrifice, then I accept that you&#13;
&#13;
have a strong reason to go, and that it is your genuine wish to go. I will not stand in your&#13;
&#13;
way." And, of course, until then because of the fact that McNamara didn't want me to go, it&#13;
&#13;
didn't matter what I did in terms of going around looking for jobs; the moment they&#13;
&#13;
checked into my availability, they'd find: "Well, McNamara doesn't want him to go. ' He&#13;
&#13;
wants him to stay here." So nobody was going to offer me a job. The fact that he was now&#13;
&#13;
prepared to let me go thus made a big difference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              25&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 26&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did you negotiate this with McNamara on a one-on-one basis?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No. This would have been through John Adler or perhaps through Peter Cargill, I&#13;
&#13;
canâ&#128;&#153;t recall ever discussing that type of thing with McNamara personally. But the logjam&#13;
&#13;
disappeared. So I was sent off to see the Personnel Department. I went off to see Jim&#13;
&#13;
Jennings, who was the Assistant Director of Personnel dealing specifically with project&#13;
&#13;
staff since he had been a projects manager himself. I was told to go and see him and this is&#13;
&#13;
where I definitely got confirmation that McNamara had cleared my departure, because he&#13;
&#13;
was prepared to see me and discuss my case. I talked to him and he said to me: "I&#13;
&#13;
understand you want to go, and since there arenâ&#128;&#153;t any 27 Level jobs, youâ&#128;&#153;ve even expressed&#13;
&#13;
a willingness to take a 26 Level job." I didnâ&#128;&#153;t really know Jim Jennings at that stage. I&#13;
&#13;
replied: "Yes, that is true." Then he looked at me in puzzlement and asked: "What kind of&#13;
&#13;
job in Operations do you think you can do?" So I said, "Well, the obvious thing for me&#13;
&#13;
was to go as a division chief in Agriculture." because the thing on which I have the most&#13;
&#13;
experience. He looked at me and told me: "Get with it. How can you be a division chief in&#13;
&#13;
a projects department, when youâ&#128;&#153;ve got no experience in projects?" I shook my head and&#13;
&#13;
asked him: â&#128;&#156;What do you mean, no experience in projects?" He had looked at my file&#13;
&#13;
when McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s clearance had come and he saw that the last three years I'd been in&#13;
&#13;
PMB, and the two years before that I'd been program coordinator, and here I was in 1977.&#13;
&#13;
He'd looked back five years, which he thought was enough, and, of course, finds absolutely&#13;
&#13;
zero operational experience. He never bothered looking at where one had spent the rest of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             26&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 27&#13;
&#13;
oneâ&#128;&#153;s life. So I said to him then: "Jim, thank you very much. I think Iâ&#128;&#153;ll look after myself,&#13;
&#13;
and not rely on Personnel." If they couldnâ&#128;&#153;t even read oneâ&#128;&#153;s file what good were they in&#13;
&#13;
getting you a job? So I just ignored them and went around looking for a job. And once&#13;
&#13;
again, I found Willi Wapenhans, who by then was Regional Vice President for East Africa&#13;
&#13;
and who had been my patron in EMENA. As luck would have it, he was going to create a&#13;
&#13;
third agriculture division in addition to the existing two which were headed by Mike&#13;
&#13;
Walden and Chris Walton. He was just beginning to look for a third agricultural division&#13;
&#13;
chief and as soon as I walked on the scene, he offered me the job. As a matter of fact, he&#13;
&#13;
also raised the idea that I should become one of the Program Directors, the job that you&#13;
&#13;
took a little later. Stanley Please was the Director of East Africa Department at the time.&#13;
&#13;
He had got himself into all sorts of problems with McNamara and Peter Cargill and Willi&#13;
&#13;
Wapenhans. Apart from the fact that they thought he was still stuck with the mid-â&#128;&#153;30s&#13;
&#13;
economics taught at the LSE, he had made some statements to the Board at the time when&#13;
&#13;
the East Africa Community had broken up and there was a question of whether the former&#13;
&#13;
member states were going to repay the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s loans. The question was whether we played&#13;
&#13;
hard ball with the Kenyans and things about honoring the guarantee that they had given for&#13;
&#13;
the Community debt. Stanley had taken the view that we should not hold Kenya&#13;
&#13;
responsible for more than the half of the debt or the amount that economically they were&#13;
&#13;
responsible. He argued against invoking the joint guarantee which Kenya as the financially&#13;
&#13;
strongest member would have to honour, if the others reneged. He wanted to split up the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              27&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 28&#13;
&#13;
debt and the responsibilities for the debt, whereas the financial people wanted to keep each&#13;
&#13;
of the three countries on the hook for the whole of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    MAR 1 6 2011&#13;
Q:      Well, he moved to East Asia and became program director and then later Â®lchption 8 'f. ~&#13;
                                                                                                 "/~.&#13;
moved to Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Peter Cargill felt strongly that Stanley should go and that I should replace him. But,&#13;
&#13;
of course, that ran into all sorts of problems. There was Ping Loh, who was a program&#13;
&#13;
division chief in the East Africa Region, who was incensed at the idea that he would be&#13;
&#13;
passed over for. Anyway, the whole idea never really took off, but it was one of those little&#13;
&#13;
incidents in life.&#13;
&#13;
        I was very happy to become a division chief. I must say the five years that I spent&#13;
&#13;
as a division chief in Agriculture, except when I had to deal with you at the end of this&#13;
&#13;
period, was really one of the most pleasant, hard-working, but pleasant experiences that&#13;
&#13;
I've had. I never regretted having stepped down to become a division chief for five years in&#13;
&#13;
agriculture. It was the first time I'd actually run my own unit and the fact that it was a&#13;
&#13;
lower level than I was doing before was neither here nor there. I had my troops and had&#13;
&#13;
some real responsibility. I was very enthused about the countries I was dealing with imd I&#13;
&#13;
was very enthused about the type of work. I had good staff and I just enjoyed it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              28&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 29&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Of course, the Bank was not very effective in helping agriculture in East Africa.&#13;
&#13;
That was the time when we were making all this integrated rural development projects&#13;
&#13;
which failed.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Ah! Yes. But I stopped those. That was one of my accomplishments. I inherited a&#13;
&#13;
lot of those projects but began to get rid of them.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      But you were also still caught in the momentum which kept us lending for these&#13;
&#13;
projects even when I joined in 1979. So you kept on making more of these credits at least&#13;
&#13;
initially.&#13;
&#13;
A:      The one area where we did continue to make them was in Malawi because they&#13;
&#13;
worked, and they continued to work in Malawi.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What about Tanzania?&#13;
&#13;
A:      In Tanzania we stopped them. Theyâ&#128;&#153;d all been done by the Central Projects staff&#13;
&#13;
under Leif Christofferson. They were pushing these schemes. I took over the appraisal of&#13;
&#13;
Mwanza-Shinyanga which had been prepared, and beyond that we didnâ&#128;&#153;t do any others.&#13;
&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#153;s for sure.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      But that was when I appeared on the scene.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Ha ha ha! Thatâ&#128;&#153;s true, you came in at that point. You were not as bad as the people&#13;
&#13;
you were replacing, who were just pushing the money out. I got very upset about&#13;
&#13;
agriculture in Tanzania because of the pricing issue. Agricultural producer prices were&#13;
&#13;
consciously depressed. Despite President Nyerereâ&#128;&#153;s very high-flown statements, they were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              29&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 30&#13;
&#13;
milking the peasantry producing the cash crops for exports and wasted the resources on&#13;
&#13;
industrialization. The Bank supported some really weird projects on the industrial side&#13;
&#13;
before I arrived.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Was that the shoe factory in Morogoro?&#13;
&#13;
A:     The shoe factory in Morogoro was one example. Nyerereâ&#128;&#153;s rhetoric was always&#13;
&#13;
wonderful but his actions on the ground were a complete contradiction of all the haloed&#13;
&#13;
principles he espoused. It took me a couple of years to figure this out. The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
policies were really detrimental to the peasants. I use the word "peasants" on purpose,&#13;
&#13;
because that represented the attitude of the political leadership. They would not put prices&#13;
&#13;
up because in their view these people wouldn't respond to prices in any case. It was really a&#13;
&#13;
form of forced collectivization that they had engaged in. This made life very difficult&#13;
&#13;
altogether for doing sensible agricultural projects. We found it increasingly difficult to&#13;
&#13;
identify anything that we could sensibly lend for which would have any chance of&#13;
&#13;
working. The only reason that I kept on with any agricultural lending was because I saw&#13;
&#13;
no sensible alternative. I would go to the country programs people and tell them: "I think&#13;
&#13;
that we ought not to be lending any more money to Tanzania for agriculture." Their&#13;
&#13;
reaction was: "Fine. Well, we'll shift the money to some other sector, like roads." If they&#13;
&#13;
did spent it on roads I was quite happy, because the road system had collapsed for lack of&#13;
&#13;
maintenance. But the programs divisionâ&#128;&#153;s reaction was that they wouldn't put it into roads&#13;
&#13;
because the roads people had said that it was a waste of time to put money into roads&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              30&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 31&#13;
&#13;
because the Tanzanians couldnâ&#128;&#153;t maintain them. They were going to put the money into&#13;
&#13;
some other sectors which I thought were a total waste. I remember saying at that point: "If&#13;
&#13;
you are going to waste money on Tanzania, then Iâ&#128;&#153;d rather waste it on agriculture because&#13;
&#13;
at least some of the money is going to trickle down to the areas where it is most needed,&#13;
&#13;
even if the projects donâ&#128;&#153;t work properly. So I will find some projects somehow or other."&#13;
&#13;
But the projects became weirder and weirder because there were so few things that were&#13;
&#13;
left that farmers could make money on. Then in the end we had this major study on&#13;
&#13;
Tanzanian agriculture that Umma Lele did. The study had its effect of exposing the&#13;
&#13;
problems caused by faulty policies, although I donâ&#128;&#153;t think things had improved much by&#13;
&#13;
the time I left in 1982.&#13;
&#13;
        A very sorry picture. I remember when I first went to Tanzania in 1969 or 1970&#13;
&#13;
when I did a tobacco project which had disappeared by the time I got back in the mess of&#13;
&#13;
the Ujamaa forced collectivization. When I appraised that project in the early â&#128;&#153;70s Ujamaa&#13;
&#13;
was just being thought of in terms of a purely voluntary type of cooperative movement&#13;
&#13;
without any pressure on farmers to join. If you read my appraisal report of that project, it&#13;
&#13;
says the biggest risk of the project is that this concept of a purely voluntary collectivization&#13;
&#13;
will end being a forced collectivization, in which case the project will collapse. I had&#13;
&#13;
mentioned that because Iâ&#128;&#153;d suffered through a similar exercise in Tunisia where they also&#13;
&#13;
started with the best rhetoric, and in the end the government insisted that the whole lot&#13;
&#13;
would be collectivized and of course the whole farm economy imploded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              31&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 32&#13;
&#13;
       By the time I got back in 1977, forced Ujimaa had taken place, and much of the&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s money had been used for that purpose. Special examples were the Geita Cotton&#13;
&#13;
project and the National Maize Project which had been developed in that context.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now when you compared what you had seen earlier with what you found when you&#13;
&#13;
came back could you sense that not only had change taken place but that Africa was&#13;
&#13;
moving into a state of crisis?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, I wouldn't claim that because I didn't know enough about Africa as a whole. I&#13;
&#13;
hadn't seen much outside of East Africa. But I can remember going on my first extended&#13;
&#13;
trip to Tanzania. It was around Christmas when I got back, so it must have been either&#13;
&#13;
Christmas '77 or '78, it can't have been later than that. Monty Yudelman, who was head of&#13;
&#13;
the Agriculture Department, was very pro-Tanzania and its Ujimaa experiments. Tanzania&#13;
&#13;
and the integrated area development projects were their show case. Now after my return in&#13;
&#13;
January, and I think it must have been January of '78, I attended one of those annual&#13;
&#13;
luncheons which McNamara had with all the agriculture division chiefs and the assistant&#13;
&#13;
directors for agriculture. At these luncheons people would give a report on the problems&#13;
&#13;
they had encountered and Monty Yudelman would give his spiel the aim of which was to&#13;
&#13;
please McNamara not us. He was a great one for that. And then he'd ask for questions.&#13;
&#13;
Some of the questions were planted and some of the interventions were genuine. On this&#13;
&#13;
occasion, he made a speech on agriculture in general, and then he turned to McNamara and&#13;
&#13;
said: "And since Tanzania is one of your favorite countries," which it certainly was, "you&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             32&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 33&#13;
&#13;
may want to ask Steve Eccles to say a few words about his visit. Heâ&#128;&#153;s just come back from&#13;
&#13;
his first visit as the new division chief for agriculture.â&#128;? This was a complete surprise and&#13;
&#13;
certainly not one of those planted interventions. Evidently, he expected me to tell&#13;
&#13;
McNamara how wonderful everything was in Tanzania. And I stood up and said: "I'm&#13;
&#13;
sorry, Monty, but I think that we have been sold a bill of goods on Tanzania. Tanzania has&#13;
&#13;
been the biggest disappointment that I've had so far in my trips around. This country is in&#13;
&#13;
worse shape than it was when I visited it and appraised a project there in 1970, by any&#13;
&#13;
measure you'd like to apply." When I was there in 1970 I could drive down to Iringa. I&#13;
&#13;
could drive across the country to various other places in reasonable quick order. Today,&#13;
&#13;
you can't virtually drive anywhere, the roads are in such a mess. The pricing of farm goods&#13;
&#13;
is such that the farmers are not better off, probably worse off than they were when I was&#13;
&#13;
here last. If I walk around Dar I do not see the progress that I have seen in other places&#13;
&#13;
over a similar sort of 10-year period. If you went to India in '65 and you went back in '77,&#13;
&#13;
you could see signs of progress. If you went to Morocco in '68 and you went back in '77,&#13;
&#13;
you'd see signs of progress. They may not be spectacular, but you see definite signs of&#13;
&#13;
progress. In Tanzania, as far as I can see, there's either been no progress at all, or we've&#13;
&#13;
even gone backwards, and I suspect actually we've gone backwards." Then I concluded:&#13;
&#13;
"The rhetoric about Tanzania simply bears no relationship to the reality on the ground. I've&#13;
&#13;
read all of Nyerereâ&#128;&#153;s speeches and they have nothing to do with what is happening in the&#13;
&#13;
country.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              33&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 34&#13;
&#13;
       McNamara was obviously a little bit shocked, but he did not react by telling me&#13;
&#13;
that I was wrong. He said simply: "Oh, dear. I must go back there fairly soon and have&#13;
&#13;
another look." Which he did, to come to the same conclusion, and he started to have a less&#13;
&#13;
rosy-eyed view of Tanzania. I remember Willi Wapenhans taking a Kenya Program Paper&#13;
&#13;
for a review with McNamara. At that time Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s performance had been going down a&#13;
&#13;
bit, and McNamara was quite brutal in his criticism. And I can remember Willi saying:&#13;
&#13;
"Well, it's not as bad as Tanzania," and McNamara really turning on him saying: "Well,&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania is absolutely nothing by which you'd want to measure anybody else's success."&#13;
&#13;
At that stage I realized that he really had changed his view entirely. But McNamara had&#13;
&#13;
been clearly befuddled by Nyerere's charm and his clever rhetoric. Nyerere had the perfect&#13;
&#13;
solution to the poverty problem and he was still preaching it when you arrived.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     He was very intelligent and what he said was all hanging together.&#13;
&#13;
A:     That's right. If you thought which leader in Africa cares most for his farmers than&#13;
&#13;
any other leader in Africa most people would say Nyerere. All the Scandinavians would&#13;
&#13;
have said Nyerere. And our own people would have said Nyerere. But it simply wasn't&#13;
&#13;
true. I think he believed his own rhetoric; I don't think he was an immoral or cynical man.&#13;
&#13;
But what he had in mind was just totally unrealistic. I can remember being in Morogoro at&#13;
&#13;
the Tanzania Cotton Authority where I had a meeting with all the managers together. The&#13;
&#13;
general manager had called the meeting of all the people because this big shot from&#13;
&#13;
Washington was here and they wanted to discuss where things were. I mean, we were not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             34&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 35&#13;
&#13;
doing another cotton project at that stage. This must have been late 1980 or early â&#128;&#153;81, when&#13;
&#13;
this guy in public asked me to explain the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s policy on the exchange rate,&#13;
&#13;
because they presumed that we had something to do with it. He wanted to tell me how&#13;
&#13;
absolutely ridiculous the policy was and how there was no way they could pay their&#13;
&#13;
farmers and keep the Authority in the pink, because the amount of money that they needed&#13;
&#13;
for the essential transport and the processing left just literally nothing to give to the&#13;
&#13;
farmers. If a devaluation took place, which they thought was the right thing to do, even&#13;
&#13;
though they had some imported inputs, they would be able to pay the farmers some decent&#13;
&#13;
price at the end of the month. You can imagine that this was a very difficult question to ask&#13;
&#13;
in public for a public official. But weâ&#128;&#153;d been over the figures with them to explain why it&#13;
&#13;
was that we couldnâ&#128;&#153;t do another cotton project. There was no way to justify such a project&#13;
&#13;
on financial grounds.&#13;
&#13;
        The other thing that I remember from that period in Tanzania was when the&#13;
&#13;
Tanzanians were beginning to think about devaluing, at least the IMF was seriously&#13;
&#13;
discussing the prospect with them. The IMF instead of saying: "We think on&#13;
&#13;
macroeconomic grounds that the exchange rate ought to be X instead of Y," came to the&#13;
&#13;
Bank saying: "You tell me what the exchange rate ought to be, on the basis of agriculture."&#13;
&#13;
I found the argument in fact quite convincing, their view was that basically Tanzania was&#13;
&#13;
an agricultural country, and that the industry was farcical. Therefore, they said, unless we&#13;
&#13;
can get a supply response out of the agricultural sector, there is no future for this country&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               35&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                          Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 36&#13;
&#13;
because it is never going to be able to import the kinds of things that it needs to import if&#13;
&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s going to develop like any other country. Therefore, we need to fix the exchange rate&#13;
&#13;
such that the production of certain agricultural commodities becomes once again a paying&#13;
&#13;
proposition. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the exchange rate which they need. Which wasnâ&#128;&#153;t quite the way that Iâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
&#13;
been taught how to determine the exchange rates, but in the type of economy we were&#13;
&#13;
talking about, it made a great deal of sense. So we went to work analyzing crop by crop&#13;
&#13;
what exchange rates would make these crops viable. That had quite an impact, I think, on&#13;
&#13;
the rate that the IMF was prepared to talk about with Tanzania. But, of course, a&#13;
&#13;
devaluation did not take place, at least not by the time I left in â&#128;&#153;82.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      No. It didnâ&#128;&#153;t happen until 1986. In some way the Tanzania situation was displaying&#13;
&#13;
symptoms which caused most other African countries to get into trouble and where our&#13;
&#13;
lending was not seemingly related to solving any of their problems. Now, how can you&#13;
&#13;
say that this was one of the periods in your career that you wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have wanted to miss?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Oh, because my work was unrelated to that broader issue. I was talking about this&#13;
&#13;
experience in terms of, first of all, oneâ&#128;&#153;s personal development and the fact that one was&#13;
&#13;
running a division with people, real live people doing real live work. That was a real&#13;
&#13;
challenge. The fact that these countries were not just push-overs and it just wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a routine&#13;
&#13;
business, made it especially interesting. Every time you had a project you had to think&#13;
&#13;
about what you were doing and whether it made sense, given the circumstances of the&#13;
&#13;
country. Even the frustration of working in Tanzania, for a while I could take as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               36&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 37&#13;
&#13;
challenge. I would take considerable pleasure in talking to people and trying to get them to&#13;
&#13;
see things in a different light.&#13;
&#13;
        There were both positive and negative experiences I had. Both in Tanzania on food&#13;
&#13;
prices and in Malawi on prices in general, I had a considerable amount of discussion with&#13;
&#13;
the authorities about the responsiveness of their farmers to pricing. It was unbelievable&#13;
&#13;
that in the mid-â&#128;&#153;70s, one was still getting into discussions with Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
&#13;
officials who would argue that giving more money to a farmer made no sense because if he&#13;
&#13;
earns more all he will do is drink it away in beer. Instead, it was just as well to accumulate&#13;
&#13;
more money for the government. The farmers wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t feel challenged by higher prices;&#13;
&#13;
they will simply work less. If you double their effective wages, they'll work half as hard.&#13;
&#13;
That was the official view in Malawi. But I was able to get that changed. It wasn't enough&#13;
&#13;
to solve all the country's problems, but within agriculture it had quite a positive impact.&#13;
&#13;
The same was true in Tanzania, although it was short-lived, and it didn't involve&#13;
&#13;
devaluation. When there was a drought and a shortage of food in Tanzania, and we told&#13;
&#13;
them to put the prices up for food to get more supplies the government rejected our advice&#13;
&#13;
initially, but eventually they were desperate enough and then they actually raise prices and&#13;
&#13;
found that production did go up. They were amazed. But did they draw a lesson from this&#13;
&#13;
experience? Unfortunately, the answer was no; there was no movement to apply price&#13;
&#13;
incentives on a broader scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              37&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 38&#13;
&#13;
       The interaction with the authorities increased oneâ&#128;&#153;s understanding of Tanzania. In&#13;
&#13;
that sense the discussions I had with officials in the province of Mwanza about the use of&#13;
&#13;
fertilizer were typical. The government in Tanzania was highly decentralized, way ahead&#13;
&#13;
of Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s capability to manage the system. It was a system designed for a very&#13;
&#13;
sophisticated society, somewhat similar in structure to the organization of the Bank. Each&#13;
&#13;
province had a director in charge of all the sectors of the economy. The district agriculture&#13;
&#13;
officer who reported to him also had a reporting relationship with the Ministry of&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture which was very similar to the relationship in the Bank between an agricultural&#13;
&#13;
division chief and the central agricultural department. It was a technical relationship, but&#13;
&#13;
basically the agricultural officer owed more of his allegiance to the district projects&#13;
&#13;
director in Tanzania. I mean, the, the correlation was extremely close between the two&#13;
&#13;
patents, and I believe they were done by the same, by the same people.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     The political structure based on the party had been designed by the East Germans&#13;
&#13;
was headed by all these commissar-type people.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. But on the technical side, the big wheels wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t necessarily&#13;
&#13;
understand all the sectors. So the regional commissioners formed groups of sectoral people&#13;
&#13;
and would supposedly react to Nyerere in a direct line of communications. It was a very&#13;
&#13;
interesting organizational structure but Tanzania just did not have the people to staff it&#13;
&#13;
properly. The talent was spread so thinly spread over and the link to the decision-making&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              38&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 39&#13;
&#13;
center to get things moving or to make the necessary corrective adjustments did not exist in&#13;
&#13;
practice.&#13;
&#13;
        The point of this story was that when I went to Mwanza and met the agricultural&#13;
&#13;
officer who was in charge of the Geita cotton project and Mwanza-Shinyanga area&#13;
&#13;
development project, I reviewed with him the reasons why our projects did not seem to&#13;
&#13;
move. The government was insisting on the subsidization of fertilizer and our money was&#13;
&#13;
not used because we would not agree to finance subsidized fertilizer. The reason why we&#13;
&#13;
did not agree with the subsidy was that it meant that fertilizer was used where it was not&#13;
&#13;
appropriate to be used. There was a big fertilizer push by Tanzania when in the late â&#128;&#153;70s. In&#13;
&#13;
dryland areas it was usually doing more harm than good, because if it rained, which it&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t always, you would be very happy if you had the fertilizer. But by the time it rained,&#13;
&#13;
if you hadnâ&#128;&#153;t put the fertilizer on, it was too late; you had to put the fertilizer on before you&#13;
&#13;
knew the rains were coming. And, of course, if the rains did not come in anything like the&#13;
&#13;
right amount, then you were actually worse off because the crops would do worse if there&#13;
&#13;
was fertilizer and little rain than they would otherwise. So the farmers generally did not&#13;
&#13;
use very much fertilizer in these areas, and were very well advised not to use it. But there&#13;
&#13;
was this big push through the Ujama command structure. The first year the fertilizer was&#13;
&#13;
distributed free of charge, - it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t even subsidized, it was free of charge - and the&#13;
&#13;
farmers were ordered to put it onto their fields. They did, and it was a disaster. So the next&#13;
&#13;
year, when they received the fertilizer, they did not put it on. The farmers got it because&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 40&#13;
&#13;
they had to take delivery of their bags of fertilizer, but they had found that when mixed&#13;
&#13;
with water fertilizer made a very nice paste for putting on houses which proved to very&#13;
&#13;
effective as an anti-termite treatment. Youâ&#128;&#153;d go to Shinyanga and Geita and you found all&#13;
&#13;
the houses were spanking white, because theyâ&#128;&#153;d all been painted with fertilizer, particularly&#13;
&#13;
the wooden parts of the houses.&#13;
&#13;
        I went to see the district director in Mwanza, who as it turned out was a biologist, a&#13;
&#13;
plant biologist. In fact, I think he was specialized in pests. A well qualified man, doing a&#13;
&#13;
job that had no relationship to his training, he was completely out of his depth as a&#13;
&#13;
manager. I thought here was somebody I could actually talk to about my observation. So I&#13;
&#13;
asked him: "Why are you giving the farmers free fertilizer?" But all I could get back was&#13;
&#13;
the Party line, that fertilizer was good and that peasants thought it was good, and therefore&#13;
&#13;
the government had to give everything it. If the government gives them this fertilizer it&#13;
&#13;
shows how the government is pro-farmer and interested in agricultural development. He&#13;
&#13;
simply blocked out the idea that it was not being used for agricultural purposes and used to&#13;
&#13;
paint the farmersâ&#128;&#153; houses instead. I just couldn't get anything out of him whatsoever until&#13;
&#13;
it struck me that the cost of this fertilizer in his area was about 10 million shillings. So I&#13;
&#13;
said to him the next day: "Look, just answer me this question: You've got 10 million&#13;
&#13;
shillings to spend on your farmers. Would you rather spend that 10 million shillings buying&#13;
&#13;
them fertilizer, which he does not want and you know he shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t use because you are a&#13;
&#13;
plant biologist; or would you rather spend the 10 million shillings instead on maintaining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               40&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 41&#13;
&#13;
the farm roads or building new farm roads every year, something the farmers want and&#13;
&#13;
really need?â&#128;? And he looked at me with a big grin and said: "You are absolutely right.&#13;
&#13;
Why hadn't that occurred to me before, instead of just looking at the fertilizer supplies,&#13;
&#13;
why didn't I look at it in terms of 10 million shillings and what could I spend them on? I&#13;
&#13;
went away thinking, well, I'm going to have real success here because this guy is in charge&#13;
&#13;
and is going to stop the fertilizer distribution and we are going to actually see some&#13;
&#13;
progress. I thought itâ&#128;&#153;s a step at a time, you have to convince every person as you go along&#13;
&#13;
but in the end you can achieve something. The following morning I saw him again and his&#13;
&#13;
face was drawn and he said: "It's no good. It isn't going to work." I asked: "Why isn't it&#13;
&#13;
going to work?" And he replied: "Well," the Government doesn't give me 10 million&#13;
&#13;
shillings in cash. They give me 10,000 tons of fertilizer, and if I tell them that I don't want&#13;
&#13;
the fertilizer I won't get the fertilizer, but I won't get 10 million shillings either. So I might&#13;
&#13;
as well take the fertilizer and let them paint the houses with it." And so he continued.&#13;
&#13;
        But in Dar-es-Salam you couldn't get any dialogue going on such issues because&#13;
&#13;
the Ministry had been told that fertilizer distribution to the peasants was the right thing to&#13;
&#13;
do and it was good for the peasants. And that was that. So, in that sense, working in&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania was highly frustrating, but you nevertheless felt that somehow you were doing&#13;
&#13;
some good. I don't think many of our projects did any good, nor do I think any of them did&#13;
&#13;
any harm, but I think the economic and sector work that we started in the latter part of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                41&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 42&#13;
&#13;
period to try and pull our experience together and make some sense out of it, had in the end&#13;
&#13;
had some value.&#13;
&#13;
       Among the other countries that we dealt with Swaziland was doing quite&#13;
&#13;
reasonably, Botswana was doing quite reasonably, Malawi at that stage was doing very&#13;
&#13;
well. Malawi later got into much more serious trouble, but Malawi was never so utterly&#13;
&#13;
depressing as Tanzania was; the politics were depressing, but the, the rest of the country&#13;
&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t depressing.&#13;
&#13;
       Zambia again was very depressing, I must say. Zambia was another country where&#13;
&#13;
agriculture was totally neglected. The government just didnâ&#128;&#153;t take agriculture very&#13;
&#13;
seriously. My efforts to get the Bank to lower the boom by telling the government: "Unless&#13;
&#13;
you fix matters related to agriculture, we will not be lending for anything else because&#13;
&#13;
agriculture has to be put right. You canâ&#128;&#153;t afford to run this country on an imported food&#13;
&#13;
basis." But I didnâ&#128;&#153;t get anywhere with this position in the Bank. I had big rows with your&#13;
&#13;
predecessor, Michael Wiehen on this subject. So that was very discouraging.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You stayed in this assignment for five years and then you moved because you were&#13;
&#13;
promoted?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes. I moved to West Africa where I was initially in charge of the agriculture&#13;
&#13;
divisions. I stayed there five years also until 1987. But we changed the organization of the&#13;
&#13;
projects department halfway through my stay. Instead of having the assistant directors of&#13;
&#13;
projects looking after certain sectors or groups of sectors--in my case it was only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             42&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 43&#13;
&#13;
agriculture because agriculture was so big, we divided the region into three areas, because&#13;
&#13;
there were three of us, and each of us took responsibility for project work in a group of&#13;
&#13;
countries. It was a form of matrix organization. I was administratively responsible for a&#13;
&#13;
third of the project divisions but not for their work. On substance I was in charge of quality&#13;
&#13;
control on everything that was done in my countries by all the sector divisions. This was a&#13;
&#13;
bit complicated managerially, but it provided an interesting interface between the projects&#13;
&#13;
department and the country program departments. It provided a one stop to deal with all&#13;
&#13;
project matters. If a country director wanted to change strategy he only needed to convince&#13;
&#13;
one assistant director that that was the direction we should go in. Once we had a strategy&#13;
&#13;
for the country we had the same strategy for projects and programs and we only had to get&#13;
&#13;
that decided once.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Was that a design that was developed in West Africa for Western Africa or was it a&#13;
&#13;
Bank-wide model?&#13;
&#13;
A:     It became increasingly Bank-wide, and I donâ&#128;&#153;t think it started in West Africa. I&#13;
&#13;
think it was an East Asia model and there were great arguments about how valuable it was.&#13;
&#13;
There were some who argued that this was fine for East Asia because the countries were&#13;
&#13;
more capable of determining their priorities, but it wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t work in West Africa. There&#13;
&#13;
was a lot of discussion about it. I was not convinced in the beginning and I was one of the&#13;
&#13;
people who expressed great skepticism. I thought the main role of the assistant director&#13;
&#13;
was to safeguard the quality of the product, and that to a certain extent was dictated by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             43&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 44&#13;
&#13;
sector experience he could bring to the job. In the infrastructure sectors, for instance,&#13;
&#13;
somebody who had been involved with highways or water supply was much more likely to&#13;
&#13;
apply the right sort of quality control over a whole group of infrastructure projects than&#13;
&#13;
somebody who had never dealt with these kinds of projects before. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t be expert&#13;
&#13;
in everything, anyway. But by stretching yourself across all sectors, you were feeling quite&#13;
&#13;
overwhelmed. Suddenly I found that I was in charge of population projects and health&#13;
&#13;
projects, or heavily involved in structural adjustment lending in a number of sectors. I was&#13;
&#13;
dealing with agriculture and education, power and water supply and clearly could not&#13;
&#13;
suddenly become an expert in all these fields. Personally I found that extremely interesting&#13;
&#13;
because I found that the way that one had done quality control was not based on oneâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
special sectoral expertise. I thought I was able to perform this function because I had built&#13;
&#13;
up experience in agriculture. But, of course, this wasn't true. The real strength manifested&#13;
&#13;
itself by looking at a situation and being able to ask the right sorts of questions of other&#13;
&#13;
people who were experts. You were not supposed to step in and say: "Your fertilizer&#13;
&#13;
composition here is wrong." I couldn't have known if the fertilizer composition was right&#13;
&#13;
or wrong. But I would know how to manage the review of an agricultural project so that if&#13;
&#13;
indeed there was any question amongst the technicians about whether the fertilizer was&#13;
&#13;
right, this would come out. If everybody agreed that it was technically correct, then that&#13;
&#13;
was as much as I could do. I found that in reviewing projects on a more global basis,&#13;
&#13;
across a whole number of sectors, a deep interest in the project and whether it was going to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              44&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 45&#13;
&#13;
work, and a willingness to spend time questioning things and ensuring that there was a&#13;
&#13;
good dialogue about the project before it was allowed to go forward was really all you&#13;
&#13;
wanted. The fact that one was no more expert on third grade education curriculum than one&#13;
&#13;
was on fertilizer formulations for particular crops in particular zones didnâ&#128;&#153;t really make&#13;
&#13;
any difference. The important thing was to get a searching debate going. If the country&#13;
&#13;
programs people had concerns about the project they would get a proper hearing if I was&#13;
&#13;
reviewing the project, whether they were right or wrong, and the same with the central&#13;
&#13;
projects staff. Just by being reasonably well organized and not defensive about projects&#13;
&#13;
you could resolve most issues without much difficulty. Actually, I found it easier to be&#13;
&#13;
non-defensive about non-agricultural projects because I didn't claim to have any&#13;
&#13;
knowledge of those sectors, while in agriculture from time to time I'd actually say to&#13;
&#13;
somebody that I thought that I knew what the right answer myself; then if somebody&#13;
&#13;
disagreed with you, you tended to become defensive which was not really the right&#13;
&#13;
approach.&#13;
&#13;
       So I came to believe that this new organization was quite an interesting model.&#13;
&#13;
After all, what the Bank had always been looking for throughout all these reorganizations&#13;
&#13;
was to strike the right balance between responsiveness to country conditions, a country&#13;
&#13;
program that is relevant to the problems a country faces, and reasonable quality control&#13;
&#13;
over the individual interventions. The idea was to show that certain things can work if well&#13;
&#13;
designed and well done. In that respect, I was beginning to feel by 1987 that here we had a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             45&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 46&#13;
&#13;
model that with good people on both sides of the aisle we could produce better work since&#13;
&#13;
we were organized right.&#13;
&#13;
If you have good people, itâ&#128;&#153;s quite a good model to work with; if you have bad people then&#13;
&#13;
you are in trouble whatever organization you have. But I had people like Ismail Serageldin&#13;
&#13;
as one country director, and Bilsel Alisbah for a while as the other country director. He&#13;
&#13;
later became director of the Projects Department and my boss. I was sorry, in that sense,&#13;
&#13;
about the 1987 reorganization because I think that screwed everything up again. I think we&#13;
&#13;
made a backward step from a well-working organizational set-up in the reorganization of&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#153;87, quite definitely.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Before going to the 1987 reorganization, let me just ask, did you find moving to&#13;
&#13;
West Africa by and large let you stay within a familiar context and familiar economic&#13;
&#13;
problems?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No. West Africa was very different from East Africa. The climate was different,&#13;
&#13;
for a start, and that makes a lot of difference to agriculture. Because of the climatic&#13;
&#13;
differences what you could do and what you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t do was quite different. Some&#13;
&#13;
countries, like Senegal, were very dry and similar to parts of East Africa, but I also dealt&#13;
&#13;
with the countries in the tropical or semi-tropical wet belt that gave opportunities for&#13;
&#13;
growing many crops in good conditions. Climatically, you had greater extremes; you had&#13;
&#13;
countries like Chad, Niger and Mali, outside the irrigation zone, where you were really in&#13;
&#13;
desperate trouble for agriculture. Then when you had the water, which you did in the low&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              46&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 47&#13;
&#13;
places, there was almost no end to what you could grow. Some parts of West Africa were&#13;
&#13;
similar to East Africa, although in East Africa you didnâ&#128;&#153;t get the droughts; you didnâ&#128;&#153;t get a&#13;
&#13;
lot of rain, but you didnâ&#128;&#153;t generally get a drought. You just plowed on but there was very&#13;
&#13;
little that was exciting in terms of trying different crops in agriculture. The biggest&#13;
&#13;
difference were the people. The difference between West Africans and East Africans is&#13;
&#13;
much more marked than the difference in climate. I havenâ&#128;&#153;t sat down and analyzed it but&#13;
&#13;
there are at least two things that come immediately to mind. One is that West Africans tend&#13;
&#13;
to be much more trade-oriented, much more willing to do a deal. You get bits of this in&#13;
&#13;
Somalia and in Kenya among certain tribes, but in Tanzania itâ&#128;&#153;s practically non-existent. I&#13;
&#13;
often wondered why the Somalis run all the private trucking throughout the whole East&#13;
&#13;
Africa. Itâ&#128;&#153;s just that they are born entrepreneurs, and you wonder why the locals donâ&#128;&#153;t get&#13;
&#13;
into this business. That distinction doesnâ&#128;&#153;t exist in West Africa. Everybody is trading. So&#13;
&#13;
there is a real dynamic in these countries. I remember coming back from my first trip to&#13;
&#13;
Lagos. Lagos had a terribly bad reputation amongst Bank staff as a place you donâ&#128;&#153;t want to&#13;
&#13;
visit with unpleasant and rude people, and with everybody on the make. But when I came&#13;
&#13;
back from Nigeria, I remember David Knox asking me, what did I think of Nigeria, and I&#13;
&#13;
told him: â&#128;&#156;Oh, I enjoyed it, I thought I had a whale of a time.â&#128;? This was despite the fact&#13;
&#13;
that I'd had to bribe my way into the hotel, that I had to my bags everywhere because you&#13;
&#13;
can't get anybody to do it; it really was chaotic. And David said: "Well, how on earth?"&#13;
&#13;
Nobody believed I enjoyed being in Lagos. It was just that general sense that people&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              47&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 48&#13;
&#13;
wanted to get going, which I found stimulating. The political problems in Nigeria are&#13;
&#13;
horrendous, of course, but one of these days that country will wake up and the talent thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
there and the natural resources that sit there will turn the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economy into&#13;
&#13;
something more like East Asia. The country is not a jewel and it hasn't done nearly as well&#13;
&#13;
as Indonesia despite the similarities in terms of the oil and agricultural resources. Why one&#13;
&#13;
country has taken off and the other has not is one of the more interesting questions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I suppose that it had a lot to do with the policies pursued by the two countries.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Oh, yes. That's right. But why do you have these differences? People will point out&#13;
&#13;
that in many ways you had the same conditions in Indonesia, such as the Pertamina&#13;
&#13;
scandal, before things settled down. Indonesia wasn't exactly a corrupt-free country either.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     One of the points economists make is that the Indonesians always were very careful&#13;
&#13;
to insulate the oil money from marginalizing agriculture and marginalizing the indigenous&#13;
&#13;
sectors.&#13;
&#13;
A:     That's right. The Indonesians had a very pro-agricultural approach. Whereas what&#13;
&#13;
happened in Nigeria, was that they got totally carried away by the oil boom. But why?&#13;
&#13;
There's a difference between the Indonesian type of corruption and the Nigerian type of&#13;
&#13;
corruption which makes a lot of difference. In Indonesia you don't get the sense that the&#13;
&#13;
corruption involves taking the money to no productive purpose, taking it out of the country&#13;
&#13;
and plunking it somewhere else. Although I am sure there's lots of Indonesian money that&#13;
&#13;
ends up in Swiss bank accounts, the proportion is small compared to what one suspects has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             48&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 49&#13;
&#13;
happened in Nigeria. In Indonesia corruption takes the form of Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s family owning&#13;
&#13;
everything, but at least what they own are working factories, working estates, working&#13;
&#13;
assets. In that sense, it probably is not very different from what happened in England and&#13;
&#13;
in Europe during the industrial revolution. These societies just bubbled up; to be sure there&#13;
&#13;
was bad distribution, yet, one should always say "tut tut" as one does about Europe during&#13;
&#13;
that period or the United States during the Rockefeller era. I just wonder what would have&#13;
&#13;
happened to the world if weâ&#128;&#153;d been all been as moralistic then and stopped all this at the&#13;
&#13;
very beginning. Youâ&#128;&#153;d probably have killed whatever entrepreneurial spirit there was in&#13;
&#13;
us.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You mean the transactional corruption?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Right. In Nigeria, paying somebody the five shillings to get your license never&#13;
&#13;
worried me at all. I lived with that in Mexico and while it may be in some ways inefficient,&#13;
&#13;
it is also a cheaper way of handling things in a country with poor institutional&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure and instead of paying a large civil service a lot of money. You get what you&#13;
&#13;
want, and they can never price you out of the market because it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t do anybody any&#13;
&#13;
good. I always found the amounts involved were not unreasonable. But in Nigeria the&#13;
&#13;
money tended to flow out of the country, sometimes directly, and sometimes by the&#13;
&#13;
granting of contracts for construction of things which should never have been built at costs&#13;
&#13;
which maybe were double what they were supposed to be. That clearly didnâ&#128;&#153;t do Nigeria&#13;
&#13;
any good at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             49&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 50&#13;
&#13;
          In West Africa this commercial attitude was all based in history. The people there&#13;
&#13;
have always been relying on trading. That was part of the spirit. They are very&#13;
&#13;
entrepreneurial and they get things done.&#13;
&#13;
          The other thing which was different, of course, was that there was a difference of&#13;
&#13;
colonial experience. The French colonial experience was very different from the British,&#13;
&#13;
which in my view is not all positive at all. West Africa was never colonized in the way that&#13;
&#13;
East Africa was. The Europeans did not send Europeans there to occupy and settle the&#13;
&#13;
land. In that sense, the East African countries were real colonies in the proper meaning of&#13;
&#13;
the term. In West Africa, in contrast, the relationship was a trade-based dependency in&#13;
&#13;
origin. The countries turned out in the end to be colonies in a technical sense, but that had&#13;
&#13;
not been the intention. The intention was initially to establish beachheads for trade, much&#13;
&#13;
as it had been in the Far East and in South Asia. This had an impact on the attitude of the&#13;
&#13;
people and their outlook on life which was very different from what we could see in East&#13;
&#13;
Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        In terms of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s success, however, the story was not markedly different from&#13;
&#13;
what you had seen in East Africa?&#13;
&#13;
A:        Well, it was different in different ways. Francophone West Africa was a mix of&#13;
&#13;
relatively successful coastal areas; Cameroon was successful, Ivory Coast was successful,&#13;
&#13;
Senegal, despite poor agricultural conditions, was in some ways reasonably successful.&#13;
&#13;
Then you had the Sahel countries; there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t very much anybody could do about Mali&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               50&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 51&#13;
&#13;
and Niger and Chad, they should never have been countries in the first place. That was a&#13;
&#13;
huge, in my view, a huge error on the part of the French, to allow some of those countries&#13;
&#13;
to emerge in ways which are basically non-viable, there is just no way that those countries&#13;
&#13;
can ever be economically viable as independent countries. But then linking together those&#13;
&#13;
countries with the Cameroons and the Ivory Coasts and the Togos and Benins, and all&#13;
&#13;
having the same exchange rate, and some producing all the exportable goods was supposed&#13;
&#13;
to keep everything going. But, of course, this system could not last; there is no one&#13;
&#13;
exchange rate which is suitable for Chad and for Ivory Coast, and no amount of fiddling&#13;
&#13;
around is going to help that. A lot of the economic problems of West Africa were related to&#13;
&#13;
that exchange rate system, and, of course, once you have to do a devaluation it will cause a&#13;
&#13;
very painful shock. This is something for which the French have to take the main blame,&#13;
&#13;
but I think the Bank deserves blame as well for not standing up to the French. That was&#13;
&#13;
the most depressing aspect of my work in West Africa. We simply refused to talk about the&#13;
&#13;
devaluation. When I first arrived, I remember going to Luis de Azcarate, our chief&#13;
&#13;
economist, to talk about our economic work program and I told him: "The only issue that I&#13;
&#13;
can see here that matters isn't even on the list, I mean the exchange regime.â&#128;? But we were&#13;
&#13;
not doing any work on that subject at that stage simply because we knew it was a waste of&#13;
&#13;
time to do it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      It's only very recently that some people came to grief over this, and then it still took&#13;
&#13;
some time before the necessary corrections were agreed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              51&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 52&#13;
&#13;
A:      That is true. But 10 years before that the issue was clearly already clearly an&#13;
&#13;
important issue. It was really a pressing problem when I got there in 1982, and by the time&#13;
&#13;
I left in 1987, no serious discussion whatsoever was taking place on this issue.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Were there any project problems comparable to the area development projects in&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No. The problems with those area development projects were that they were too&#13;
&#13;
complicated because they tried to do too many things. It was a nice idea and there was&#13;
&#13;
nothing wrong in theory with taking an area and instead of just fixing one thing to do&#13;
&#13;
whatever was needed to develop the area, be it rural roads, extension, fertilizer or health&#13;
&#13;
clinics. There is nothing wrong with that in theory as long as you have an organizational&#13;
&#13;
structure which can actually support it. The big fault of all those projects was that they&#13;
&#13;
were not built on the foundation of a good economic crop for the farmers to engage in. If&#13;
&#13;
you donâ&#128;&#153;t have that you might as well forget it, unless you are prepared to subsidize&#13;
&#13;
everything, you arenâ&#128;&#153;t going to achieve anything. The fact that you put in roads and an&#13;
&#13;
extension is not going to turn Mwanza and Shinyanga into an agricultural breadbasket.&#13;
&#13;
You have to know that there is something there that actually grows and that it pays the&#13;
&#13;
farmer to grow. If that is the case, the rest to a certain extent takes care of itself. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve done&#13;
&#13;
projects in Africa which were highly successful. Uganda tea, Kenya tea, are examples of&#13;
&#13;
projects which generated oodles of money for farmers. They may have spent some of it in&#13;
&#13;
downtown Nairobi on buildings, it is true, but they also invested in their farms and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               52&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 53&#13;
&#13;
goodness knows what else. If you go into the areas where we did tea farms, you can hardly&#13;
&#13;
find the tea, because the tea provided the seed money which allowed all sorts of things to&#13;
&#13;
happen. The dirt tracks which we financed initially, when we supported the development&#13;
&#13;
of that area, are now tarmacked roads; they are tarmacked because there is economic&#13;
&#13;
activity, not because somebody has done an area development project.&#13;
&#13;
       In West Africa the problems were somehow different. There were some countries,&#13;
&#13;
like Burkina Faso and parts of Chad and Niger, where there was a desire to go and do&#13;
&#13;
something in an area without any agricultural basis for production, and we had to try to&#13;
&#13;
dissuade people from pursuing those ideas. Then there were countries, such as the southern&#13;
&#13;
part of the Ivory Coast where crops grow in profusion. Here the issue is to pick the crop&#13;
&#13;
which will have a good market. You donâ&#128;&#153;t want to invest, which we have done, a lot in&#13;
&#13;
cocoa in an area when the cocoa market is going to collapse because once those farmers&#13;
&#13;
have put in those cocoa trees, if you made a mistake, they are stuck with it for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
So youâ&#128;&#153;ve got to be very careful. And that was very difficult under the pricing regime you&#13;
&#13;
had in those countries. You wanted to help, and you would fund projects of that kind but&#13;
&#13;
they turned out to be very variable in their long-term prospects. It was very difficult to&#13;
&#13;
find the right decision under a price regime where the country was constantly manipulating&#13;
&#13;
the pricing for whatever reasons. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t even that you had a fixed export duty or tax&#13;
&#13;
regime. Taxes and duties would vary from year to year and crop to crop according to how&#13;
&#13;
much they thought they could soak the agricultural sector. So pricing did not give reliable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              53&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/18/95, Page 54&#13;
&#13;
signals to the producer and investor, they were constantly interfered with all the way down&#13;
&#13;
to the farmers. But these were totally different problems from the problems we&#13;
&#13;
encountered in East Africa. Farmers were doing quite well, even if they were in the wrong&#13;
&#13;
crop. The cocoa farmer isnâ&#128;&#153;t going to starve; perhaps he should have been an oils farmer,&#13;
&#13;
but heâ&#128;&#153;s still not going to starve. This is very different compared with some areas where&#13;
&#13;
farmers can hardly grow a crop at all and the only crop they could grow, like cotton, wasnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
worth getting into, because the farmers didnâ&#128;&#153;t get paid for it properly, as in Tanzania. In&#13;
&#13;
this sense, the West African countries presented a very different set of problems, much&#13;
&#13;
more like the problems you would encounter in Latin America or even in Asia.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, we should break here. Thank you very much, Stephen.&#13;

            On April 5, 11, 18, and 25, 1995,
            Stephen D. Eccles was interviewed on behalf of the World
            Bank Group Archives oral history program by Jochen Kraske.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1966 to 1994, Mr. Eccles
            worked in the following areas: as a young professional
            (1966-1967); in the agriculture projects department as a
            project officer (1967-1970), as assistant to the director
            (1971), and as deputy chief to the agro-industrial division;
            in the Europe, Middle East and North Africa (EMENA) region
            as program coordinator (1972-1974); in the program and
            budgeting department as financial advisor (1975-1976); in
            the eastern Africa region as chief of the East and South
            Africa agriculture division (1977-1982); in the western
            Africa region as assistant director for the projects
            department (1982-1987); in financial operations as deputy
            treasurer and director (1987-1990); and as vice president
            and controller (1990-1994). Although Mr. Eccles specialized
            in country economics, he knew a lot about project economic
            analysis. His transcript concerns his work on the loan
            portfolio review, an extensive review of an agriculture
            project in Tanzania, and the reorganization of the World
            Bank in 1987.
