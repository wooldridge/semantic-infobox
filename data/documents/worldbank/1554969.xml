INCIDENCE OF POVERTY AND THE CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
OF THE POOR IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA, 1973&#13;
This study examines the results of the Household Expenditure and&#13;
Income Survey conducted in Peninsular Malaysia during 1973 in order to&#13;
better understand the correlates of poverty. It illustrates the important&#13;
implications of the ranking criteria (per capita vs. total household expen-&#13;
diture or income) and the choice of units of aggregation (households or&#13;
individuals) for the measures of-inequality.&#13;
Following a discussion of the relative concept of poverty, the charac-&#13;
teristics of households or population in different deciles of per capita&#13;
expenditure are examined separately for urban, rural and all areas. Major&#13;
differences are seen in the demographic characteristics, the proportion of&#13;
persons with no schooling, the "crude" labour force participation rates and&#13;
the sectoral distribution of the workers, but not in the participation rates&#13;
of persons aged 15-64, nor in the incidence of unemployment.&#13;
Secondly, according to a poverty line used in a recent World Bank&#13;
Study, the incidence of absolute poverty is above the average both in urban&#13;
and rural areas if the head of the household (a) has received no formal&#13;
schooling, (b) is self-employed or a family helper, or (c) is an agricul-&#13;
tural worker. The broad pattern and regional variations in the incidence&#13;
of poverty, etc. remain unchanged even with a 30 percent lower poverty line.&#13;
According to a multivariate analysis of the per capita expenditure,&#13;
educational attainment of the household head stands out as the most impor-&#13;
tant explanatory variable, with ethnic group, child-dependency ratio of&#13;
the household and the class of worker of the head next in importance.&#13;
Education is also the most important determinant of the earnings of the&#13;
employees.&#13;
Finally, several of the estimates of the elasticity of demand for&#13;
different categories of consumption items vary according to the ranking&#13;
criterion used to demarcate the deciles.&#13;

Preface&#13;
This paper presents main findings of an on-going analysis of&#13;
the data collected in a large-scale survey of household expenditure&#13;
and income conducted in Peninsular Malaysia during 1973. It marks a&#13;
further step in the continuing collaboration of researchers at the&#13;
World Bank and the Department of Statistics, Government of Malaysia.&#13;
This effort is designed to make maximum use of survey data for under-&#13;
standing the problems and processes of development. However, neither&#13;
the Malaysian Department of Statistics nor the World Bank is responsible&#13;
for any of the views expressed in this paper.&#13;
The analysis is also part of the Joint ESCAP-IBRD Project&#13;
on Income Distribution in Asia, under which the Development Research&#13;
Center of the World Bank is conducting an intensive study of the socio-&#13;
economic characteristics of different income or expenditure groups in&#13;
Gujarat and Maharashtra States of India, 18 development centers or towns&#13;
of Nepal, Peninsular Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Taiwan. We are indebted to&#13;
the Malaysian Department of Statistics for their encouragement and co-&#13;
operation in this project.&#13;
The present analysis is based on 12 tapes containing the&#13;
monthly data collected in 1973 from the Household Expenditure Survey&#13;
(HES), plus the summary statistics on expenditure on durable goods&#13;
collected from the same sample of households in the course of the 1974&#13;
Household Income Survey (HIS). These tapes were edited and, to some extent,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-viii-&#13;
combined at the Development Research Center during 1975-76, following&#13;
which a set of tabulations were supplied to the Department of Statistics&#13;
to provide a basic input into the published survey results. The present&#13;
paper attempts to take the analysis further by providing more elaborate&#13;
tabulations and analysis of the same data with the specific objective of&#13;
understanding the varied dimensions of poverty. This work does not draw&#13;
on the detailed data on incomes provided by the HIS.&#13;
I am indebted to Mr. Khoo Teik Huat, Acting Chief Statistician,&#13;
Government of Malaysia, and his colleagues in the Department of Statistics&#13;
for their comments on an earlier draft of this paper.&#13;
In preparing this paper, I have received valuable assistance&#13;
and advice from Montek Ahluwalia, T.N. Srinivasan, Graham Pyatt and&#13;
Kevin Young. Most of the statistical work has been done by Shyamalendu&#13;
Pal, who has shown unusual devotion and dedication to his work. At&#13;
earlier stages of the work, R. Murti Pemmarazu, Robert E. Sterrett, Jr.,&#13;
and Shail Jain have rendered valuable assistance. The editorial advice&#13;
of Vivianne Lake has improved the presentation of the material included&#13;
in this paper. I am grateful to all of them. The responsibility for&#13;
all errors is solely mine.&#13;

I. Introduction and Summary&#13;
During the past few years, the main goal of development planning&#13;
activities has been redirected towards reducing acute poverty. The success&#13;
of planning efforts is judged in terms of the changes in the living standards&#13;
of the poor rather than according to the rates of growth of per capita&#13;
GNP, which can rise even while those at the lower rungs of the socio-&#13;
economic ladder fail to enjoy any benefits.&#13;
This new perspective has led to the belief that an understanding&#13;
of the various characteristics of the poor would help to formulate appropriate&#13;
policies to attack the problem of poverty. The large number of income&#13;
and expenditure surveys, that have been conducted in many developing&#13;
countries of the world over the past two decades, have the potential to&#13;
aid in this task provided that they also include data on the employment or&#13;
labour force characteristics of the population, and that the tabulation&#13;
and analysis of the data is geared to move beyond the initial narrow&#13;
objectives of these surveys.&#13;
The Household Expenditure and Income Survey, conducted in Peninsular&#13;
Malaysia during 1973, provides an excellent basis to demonstrate the sort&#13;
of tabulations and analysis that can be attempted. The data collected in&#13;
this large-scale survey of over 7,500 households, spread over the entire&#13;
year, have been used here to estimate the incidence of poverty or the pro-&#13;
portion of households below a specified poverty line and the characteristics&#13;
of households or population falling in different deciles.&#13;
Two annexes to this paper outline (i) the procedures used to&#13;
collect the data on expenditure and income of sample households and the demo-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
graphic and economic characteristics of their members; (ii) the comparability&#13;
of the data on average expenditure and income during the reference month of&#13;
the Household Expenditure Survey (HES) with other estimates and the plausibility&#13;
of savings rates; and (iii) the comparability of the demographic and the&#13;
labour force data of the HES with those of the 1970 Census.&#13;
It is evident that the HES was meticulously designed and well&#13;
executed. Moreover it was quite ambitious and elaborate in scope. The&#13;
wealth of information gathered by it deserves to be exploited in much greater&#13;
depth than has been attempted in this paper. A detailed comparative study&#13;
of the HES data on income by source and the corresponding data from the&#13;
Household Income Survey (HIS) might help to understand some of the problems&#13;
in obtaining reliable income data.l/ Of course, such a comparative analysis&#13;
encounters many problems such as changes in the household size and in the&#13;
number of earners reported in the two surveys. Some of the requisite&#13;
analysis can be done only by the Malaysian Department of Statistics who&#13;
might attempt to identify whether or to what extent the changes are due to&#13;
response errors or to the change in the reference period. Although the HIS&#13;
data might represent an average or normal situation with respect to income,&#13;
they may also be affected by recall problems. Further, the expenditure and&#13;
labour force particulars are available only for the reference months, from&#13;
the HES and, therefore, the analysis in this paper relies entirely on the&#13;
HES data.&#13;
1/ A short reference period, such as was used in the HES, has the advantage&#13;
of helping to minimize the problem of recalling past income and expenditure.&#13;
For estimating income disparities and poverty, however, the long-term&#13;
situation is of primary interest; and the data for a full year might be&#13;
a better indicator of the situation. An analysis of the differences in&#13;
the reported incomes of households according to two sources can be very&#13;
useful in improving the methodology of income and expenditure surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
Compared to the 1970 Census, the Household Expenditure Survey&#13;
has reported an excess of females or a deficit of males and also a some-&#13;
what lower proportion of households with one, two or three members. The&#13;
proportion of persons aged 15 and over who had received no formal schooling&#13;
also seems considerably lower in the HES than in the census. The labour&#13;
force participation rates are higher and the incidence of unemployment lower&#13;
according to the HES than to the census; however, it is difficult to judge&#13;
to what extent the differences are due to the averaging out of the seasonal&#13;
variations in the HES since it was spread over the entire year 1973.    The&#13;
same possibility exists with respect to the much higher proportion of employees&#13;
and the lower proportion of agricultural workers reported by the HES than&#13;
by the 1970 census. The observed changes in the proportion of persons with&#13;
no schooling as well as in the distribution of the employed according to&#13;
status, industry and occupation are consistent with long-range trends but&#13;
they appear rather large for a three-year interval between the HES and the&#13;
census.&#13;
Indices of Inequality&#13;
Section II begins by examining the extent to which the ranking&#13;
of households is altered when the ranking criterion is changed from total&#13;
to per capita income or expenditure. It is shown that the proportion of&#13;
households falling in the same decile according to total and per capita&#13;
income is no more than 26.2 percent, while the corresponding figure for&#13;
ranking in terms of expenditure is 22.5 percent. A major reason for this&#13;
disparity is the differences between the average size of households falling&#13;
in a given decile according to the total or per capita income or expenditure.&#13;
The inequality index for the total income (or expenditure) of households is&#13;
significantly higher than that for the per capita income (or expenditure)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
of individuals. Also, as would be expected, inequality of expenditure is&#13;
notably lower than that of incomes.&#13;
Characteristics of the Poor According to the Relative Concept of Poverty&#13;
Section II also reviews at length the characteristics of house-&#13;
holds or population in different deciles, mainly according to per capita&#13;
expenditure (PCE). The findings are consistent with our general impressions.&#13;
In the country as a whole, the rural households are overrepresented in the&#13;
bottom deciles.&#13;
The urban and rural households have been ranked as separate groups&#13;
as well. The major differences between the bottom and top deciles are in&#13;
their average household size, the dependency ratio and the proportion of&#13;
persons with no schooling (all of which vary inversely with decile). Differ-&#13;
ences in the labour force participation rates of persons aged 15-64 are&#13;
negligible (but the "crude" participation rates for the total population&#13;
rise steadily with decile because of the age composition effect). The inci-&#13;
dence of unemployment shows a mild inverse relationship with respect to&#13;
PCE decile in urban areas but the relationship is unclear in rural areas,&#13;
probably because almost two-thirds of the unemployed are sons and daughters&#13;
who are supported by other members of the household. The incidence of&#13;
visible underemployment does, however, vary inversely with decile.&#13;
The structure of employment according to PCE decile shows an in-&#13;
crease with decile in the proportions of employees, of employers, of workers&#13;
in modern manufacturing and in the services, and of white collar workers.&#13;
The proportion of the self-employed and family helpers, and of agricultural&#13;
workers steadily declines as PCE decile rises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
Incidence of Poverty According to an Absolute Criterion&#13;
Section III examines the incidence of poverty in Peninsular Malaysia&#13;
according to an absolute poverty criterion and compares these findings with&#13;
those of earlier studies. The proportion of households below the poverty&#13;
line used in a recent World Bank study is 20 percent in urban areas and&#13;
45 percent in rural areas. Poverty is above the average in urban and rural&#13;
areas if the head of the household (a) has received no formal schooling, b) is&#13;
self-employed or a family helper, or (c) is an agricultural worker. Estimates&#13;
of the incidence of poverty are certainly sensitive to particular poverty&#13;
lines; but the overall pattern and regional variations in the incidence of&#13;
poverty, etc., remains unchanged even with a 30 percent lower poverty line.&#13;
Results of a Multivariate Analysis&#13;
In Section IV our multivariate analysis (in terms of the Multiple&#13;
Classification Analysis [MCA]) of the monthly per capita income (PCY of urban&#13;
and rural households explains 14 and 32 percent, respectively, of the&#13;
variance; the corresponding figures for per capita expenditure (PCE) are&#13;
37 and 36 percent. Educational attainment of the household head stands out&#13;
as the most important explanatory variable. The ethnic group is the next&#13;
important explanatory variable of PCE. For PCY in rural areas, ethnic group&#13;
explains less of the variance than does child-dependency ratio; class of&#13;
worker of the household head is next in importance. Age of the household&#13;
head, a possible indicator of life cycle effects, explains less of the variance&#13;
in PCE or PCY than does the educational attainment of the head, probably&#13;
because the effect of household size and dependency ratio has already been&#13;
allowed for.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
The percentage of total variance in PCE or PCY explained in our&#13;
multivariate analysis is no more than 40, because the characteristics of&#13;
household heads (85 percent of whom are also the main earners) do not&#13;
take into account the human capital or skills of other members within&#13;
the household. When the analysis is limited to the wages and salaries&#13;
earned by employees (in terms of their principal status during the reference&#13;
week), the explained variance increases to between 53 and 57 percent for&#13;
males, about 68 percent for females, and around 54 percent for both sexes&#13;
together (Section V). Once again, educational attainment stands out as&#13;
the most important explanatory variable, both for male and female employees.&#13;
Ethnic group is next in importance for males, particularly in rural areas,&#13;
but not for females. Occupation, age and industry seem to play a relatively&#13;
minor role, although the interaction effect, unattributed to any specific&#13;
variable, seems quite important.&#13;
Pattern of Consumption&#13;
Section VI examines the distribution of total expenditure among&#13;
different categories of consumption items, for deciles of households ranked&#13;
according to their per capita as well as total household expenditure.&#13;
Elasticities of per capita and total expenditure on each group of items&#13;
with respect to total expenditure on all commodities together have also&#13;
been estimated on the basis of different deciles. It is shown that several&#13;
of the elasticity estimates do indeed vary according to the ranking&#13;
criterion used to demarcate the deciles, although the identification of&#13;
commodity groups as income-inelastic or income-elastic generally remains&#13;
unchanged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
In conclusion, the fact that education is more important than&#13;
ethnic group as an explanatory variable for earnings of employees and for&#13;
the levels of per capita expenditure or income is reassuring insofar as it&#13;
highlights an important instrument of policy intervention. An improvement&#13;
in the availability of educational opportunities to all groups of the&#13;
population can be an important tool in a program of poverty alleviation;&#13;
nonetheless, several complementary policies based on an intensive analysis&#13;
of all available information would also be necessary.&#13;

II. Characteristics of Household Ileads or Population in Different Deciles&#13;
The characteristics of households or population falling in different&#13;
deciles in terms of their per capita expenditure or income provide some&#13;
insights into certain aspects of life of those classified as poor according&#13;
to the absolute criterion (households with a per capita expenditure below a&#13;
certain specified level) as well as the rich. Our deciles are deciles of&#13;
households and not of population. Except for some initial discussion, the&#13;
deciles considered below have been constructed separately for urban, rural&#13;
as well as all households.&#13;
The characteristics examined below include (a) demographic&#13;
characteristics, such as the average household size, sex and age&#13;
composition of household heads, sex ratio and the dependency ratio of the&#13;
population, and the educational attairment of the population aged 15 and over;&#13;
and (b) economic characteristics such as the labour force participation&#13;
rates and the incidence of unemployment, and the status, occupational and&#13;
industrial distribution of the employed. The incidence of part-time work&#13;
among the employed as well as certain characteristics of persons classified&#13;
as unemployed are also examined.&#13;
A.   Importance of the Ranking Criteria&#13;
Few studies of income distribution take due account of the impli-&#13;
cations of ranking the households or the population according to the total&#13;
or per capita income of the household.-/ The proportion of Peninsular&#13;
Malaysian households falling in the same decile when ranked according&#13;
to the total and per capita income was no more than 26.2.    The percentage&#13;
1/ An elaborate discussion of this issue is available in the author's "Poverty&#13;
and Living Standards in Asia: An Overview of the Main Results and Lessons&#13;
of Selected Household Surveys", Working Paper No. 2 of the Living Standards&#13;
Measurement Study (LSMS), World Bank, 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
of households falling in the same decilt w.hen ranked according to the total&#13;
and per capita expenditure was 22.5 percent (20.4 percent in urban areas&#13;
and 20.8 in rural areas). A major explanation for the differences in the&#13;
ranking of households according to the criterion used is the fact that the&#13;
average size of the household varies inversely with decile in terms of&#13;
PCE/PCY, whereas it rises with decile in terms of THE/THY.&#13;
The observed changes in the ranking of households in terms of THE&#13;
and PCE can be seen in Table 1, which shows for household heads of different&#13;
age groups (i) the average household size, (ii) the average total household&#13;
expenditure, and (iii) the average per capita expenditure (obtained by dividing&#13;
(ii) by (i)). Figure 1 shows the data in graphical form. The data show that&#13;
both in urban and rural areas the peak level of total household expenditure&#13;
is reached by heads aged 45-49, who also have the peak household size. Many&#13;
of these households would be in or near the top deciles in terms of total&#13;
household expenditure but not in terms of the PCE. Households with young&#13;
heads and low average size get classified in the top deciles in terms of&#13;
PCE, but they would be in the bottom deciles in terms of THE. Since the&#13;
household size first rises and then falls with respect to the age of the&#13;
household heads, a similar reclassification is likely to occur when the&#13;
ranking criterion is changed from total household income to per capita&#13;
income .-/&#13;
1/ The changes in ranking may be described as arising from the life cycle effects.&#13;
But the life cycle phenomenon seen in the earnings of wage or salary earners&#13;
(which also exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship with age because of&#13;
experience or on-the-job training) leads to a different result in the sense&#13;
that the young tend to be overrepresented in the bottom deciles of income&#13;
earners.&#13;

While a few analysts might prefer to rank households according to the total&#13;
total household income or expenditure on the ground that there exist economies of&#13;
scale in consumption, the per capita ranking appears superior because it&#13;
makes at least some allowance for the differences in the demands placed on&#13;
the resources of a household.-/ The economies of scale in consumption are un-&#13;
likely to be present with respect to all commodities and will seldom be so&#13;
important that an increase in the number of persons in the households would&#13;
not raise the total consumption needs.&#13;
1. Ranking According to Per Capita Income and Expenditure&#13;
For Peninsular Malaysia, we have the option of choosing between the&#13;
ranking of households according to per capita income or expenditure.&#13;
Since both income and expenditure pertain to only one month when a sample&#13;
household was surveyed, both have a seasonal element, which is averaged out&#13;
when the sample data are aggregated for the year as a whole. This author&#13;
has a preference for the per capita expenditure criterion on the ground that&#13;
expenditure or consumption is easier to recall than income, and therefore, ex-&#13;
penditure data are more reliable than the income data.-/ Quite probably, consumption&#13;
is more closely related to what is termed "permanent income," because the house-&#13;
holds take account of the likely temporal fluctuations in the income stream while&#13;
deciding on their expenditures. However, an important fact is that the percentage&#13;
of total households falling in the same decile according to PCE and PCY criteria&#13;
is no more than 36.7 percent (36.6 in urban areas and 33.0 in rural areas).&#13;
1/ No allowance is made for the effect of public expenditure on public&#13;
distribution of goods and services (and the likely differences in their&#13;
availability to different groups) on the ranking of households.&#13;
2/ As noted in Annex 2, the difference between PCE estimed from the HES and&#13;
the per capita private consumption estimated in the national accounts was&#13;
only 15.3 percent whereas that between PCY and the per capita GDP was&#13;
significantly larger.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. Indices of Inequality&#13;
To explore the importance of #-he ranking criteria further, we have&#13;
estimated the indices of inequality according to alternative rankings. The&#13;
difference in the estimates according to whether the unit of aggregation is&#13;
the household or the individual (i.e. whether we overlook or recognize the&#13;
number of individuals in each decile of households) is also shown in&#13;
Table 2.-/&#13;
While most studies in the literature consider the distribution of&#13;
income (or expenditure) among households, ranked according to total house-&#13;
hold income (or expenditure), it is relatively easy to take account of the&#13;
size of each household and examine the income shares for individual members&#13;
within households ranked according to their per capita income. The estimates&#13;
shown in Table 2 indicate that the simple adjustment makes considerable&#13;
difference to the inequality indices. Given the well-known insensitivity of&#13;
the Gini coefficient to considerable shifts in income distribution, differ-&#13;
ences between coefficients obtained when the households are ranked according&#13;
to their total household income (0.518) and household members according to&#13;
per capita income of the household (0.502)2/ are noteworthy.&#13;
Table 1 in the Statistical Annex shows the decile limits and the&#13;
average monthly expenditure or income per household and per person in each&#13;
1/ The Kuznets Index and the Entropy Measure have been explained in Annex 5&#13;
of my paper on "Poverty and Living Standards in Asia." LSMS Working&#13;
PaDer No. 2. World Bank, 1980.&#13;
2/ The Gini coefficient of 0.502 for the distribution of per capita income&#13;
is almost the same as Sudhir Anand's estimate (0.498), based on the data&#13;
on the "average monthly income" (from different sources) of each of the&#13;
households, asked of some 25,000 households in September 1970, in the&#13;
Post-Enumeration Survey (PES), which followed the 1970 Census. Note&#13;
that the PES income data were available only in intervals and for the&#13;
household as a whole. The number of class intervals was quite large (32).&#13;
The per capita income was estimated by relating the household size to&#13;
the estimated mean income of households falling in the interval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
of the ten deciles of households under alternative ranking criteria. The&#13;
percentage share of total expenditure (or income) accruing to deciles of&#13;
households and of population is also shown.-/ As will be shown below, average&#13;
size of households varies directly with decile when households are ranked&#13;
according to total household expenditure or income and inversely with decile&#13;
when the ranking is in per capita terms. Therefore, the bottom deciles of&#13;
households, ranked according to total expenditure or income, have less than&#13;
10 percent of the population; and when this fact is taken into account&#13;
through aggregation in terms of individuals, the indices of inequality de-&#13;
cline significantly, (even more than with the ranking in per capita terms&#13;
and aggregation in terms of individuals).&#13;
With per capita ranking, there is no real reason to adopt aggre-&#13;
gation in terms of households and to overlook the percentage of people in&#13;
each decile. If, however, we consider only the households to ensure com-&#13;
parability of the unit of aggregation under alternative ranking criteria,&#13;
once again, the indices of inequality appear significantly lower than&#13;
those under the conventional procedures. In fact, even with per capita&#13;
ranking, aggregation in terms of households leads to an understatement&#13;
of the level of inequality because the disparity in the share of total&#13;
population in different deciles of households is then overlooked.&#13;
Table 2 indicates that, as would be expected, the distribution&#13;
of expenditures is much less unequal than that of income. The effect&#13;
of the ranking criterion is similar both in urban and rural areas; and&#13;
according to all four criteria, there is less inequality in rural areas&#13;
than in urban areas. The rural-urban difference in the distribution of&#13;

to the observed values on the basis of a mathematical function proposed by&#13;
Kakwani and Podder. See: N.C. Kakwani and N. Podder, "Efficient Estimation&#13;
of the Lorenz Curve and Associated Inequality Measures from Grouped Obser-&#13;

expenditures is noticeably larger than that in the distribution of total&#13;
household expenditures (although, as shown in Table 4 below, the inter-&#13;
decile difference in average household size is smaller in rural areas than&#13;
in urban areas).&#13;
Most of the discussion in this section relates to PCE deciles,&#13;
demarcated separately for all, urban and rural areas. We shall first&#13;
examine the urban-rural distribution of households falling in different&#13;
PCE and PCY deciles.&#13;
3. Urban-Rural Distribution of Households in Different Deciles&#13;
Data presented in Table 3 conform to the expectation that when&#13;
all households are ranked according to per capita income or expenditure,&#13;
the rural households are overrepresented in the lower deciles.&#13;
Table 4 explores the average household size of households falling&#13;
in different PCY or PCE deciles, according to urban-rural residence as&#13;
well as ethnic group. Interestingly, the inter-decile range of variation&#13;
in household size is slightly larger when ranked according to PCE than&#13;
to PCY. Contrary to what one observes in most countries of the world, urban&#13;
households in Peninsular Malaysia are slightly larger than the rural, within&#13;
each PCY or PCE decile.&#13;
B. Main Demographic Characteristics of Households or Population&#13;
Table 5 and Figure 2 summarize the key demographic characteristics&#13;
of households or population falling in different deciles. The figures for&#13;
a given decile for the country as a whole are not weighted averages of&#13;
those for urban and rural households because of the reshuffle of the ranking&#13;
when they are pooled together.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
1. Average Household Size&#13;
A reference has already been made to the inverse relationship&#13;
between the average household size and the PCE or PCY decile and to the&#13;
fact that the inter-decile variation in household size is somewhat larger&#13;
in urban areas than in rural areas. Another dimension of the same&#13;
phenomenon is shown in Table A.2 in the Statistical Appendix, which provides&#13;
the size distribution of households in each decile. The percentage of&#13;
single-member households was almost 26 percent in the top decile and&#13;
1.5 percent in the bottom decile. The inter-decile difference in the&#13;
proportion of households with two members was much less, about 13 percentage&#13;
points (from 5.1 to 18.0). Almost 54 percent of the single-member house-&#13;
holds and 36 percent of two-member households fall in the top quintile.&#13;
The proportion of one- and two-member households was higher in&#13;
urban areas (9.1 and 9.6 percent, respectively) than in rural areas (6.7 and&#13;
8.7 percent, respectively) but their overrepresentation in the top quintile&#13;
was of the same order. The inter-decile range of variation in the proportion&#13;
of one- and two-member households was also similar in both urban and rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
2. Age Distribution of Household Heads&#13;
As discussed above, the average household size and the size distri-&#13;
bution of households in each decile are related to the age distribution of&#13;
heads of households.-/ According to the data presented in Table A.3 of the&#13;
Statistical Appendix, the proportion of household heads less than 30 years&#13;
1/ Although the identification of the household head in terms of the structure&#13;
of authority within a family requires a detailed inquiry, over 84 percent&#13;
of those reported as heads of households were also the main earners (see&#13;
Table A.4 in the Statistical Appendix).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
of age was over 28 percent in the top decile and only 9.5 percent in the&#13;
bottom decile. These differences are masked if we look at the median age&#13;
of household heads, which was not much different from the average (43.8&#13;
years) in the bottom eight deciles but was lower in the top two deciles&#13;
(41.4 and 39.9 years in the ninth and the tenth decile). The median age&#13;
of female heads was 49.1 years, more than six years higher than that of&#13;
male heads (42.7 years). This is related to their marital status, to be&#13;
discussed next.&#13;
3. Sex and Marital Status Composition of Household Heads&#13;
Given the current debate about the overrepresentation of women among&#13;
the poor, Table 5 shows the proportion of females among household heads in&#13;
each decile. Both in urban and rural areas, the proportion of female heads&#13;
is higher than the average in the bottom quintile and below the average in&#13;
the top quintile; but the highest percentage of female heads in urban areas&#13;
occurs in the fourth decile, and in the country as a whole in the sixth&#13;
decile.&#13;
To further examine the characteristics of female heads of households,&#13;
Table A.5 in the Statistical Appendix shows the marital status distribution&#13;
of heads in each PCE decile. Three-fifths of the female heads were widowed,&#13;
divorced or separated.    The widows and divorcees were overrepresented in the&#13;
bottom decile, whereas the never-married female heads were, of course, over-&#13;
represented in the top quintile. (The same was true of never-married male&#13;
heads of households.) The overrepresentation of widows and divorcees among&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
female heads partly accounts for their higher median age relative to that of&#13;
male heads.-/&#13;
4. Percentage of Females in the Population&#13;
Like the proportion of females among household heads, their pro-&#13;
portion in the population of different deciles also shows an overrepresentation&#13;
of women in the bottom PCE decile, both in rural and urban areas, and an&#13;
underrepresentation in the top quintile in rural areas and in the top deciles&#13;
in all areas. To some extent, the latter phenomenon is likely to be a&#13;
reflection of the overrepresentation of single-member households, often or&#13;
largely headed by males, in the top deciles.&#13;
5. Age Distribution of the Population&#13;
Differences in the age composition of persons according to different&#13;
deciles are larger than those in terms of average household size. As shown in&#13;
Table 4, the dependency ratio, i.e. the ratio of persons in the dependent ages&#13;
0-14 and 65 and over to those in the working ages 15-64, varies inversely with&#13;
PCE decile in urban as well as in rural areas.2/ The relative difference in&#13;
the dependency ratio between the bottom and the top deciles is larger in&#13;
urban areas (3.47:1) than in rural areas (2.79:1). The major difference&#13;
arises from the varying proportions of children aged 0-14 rather than of&#13;
the elderly, who account for a very small proportion of the total population&#13;
(2.9 percent).&#13;
1/ The average size of households with female heads was smaller (4.29) than&#13;
that of households with male heads (5.96). Households with only one or&#13;
two members had a much higher proportion of female heads (35.3 and 30.1&#13;
percent) than the average; conversely, almost 30 percent of the households&#13;
with female heads had only one or two members. Partly as a result, the&#13;
monthly per capita expenditure of households with female heads (M$56.0)&#13;
was only a little lower than that of households with male heads (M$57.3).&#13;
2/ Table A.6 in the Statistical Appendix shows the age distribution of&#13;
population by sex and PCE decile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
This is confirmed in Table A.17 of the Statistical Appendix&#13;
which shows the distribution of households according to PCE decile and&#13;
the number of children aged 0-14. The percentage of households with no&#13;
children increased almost steadily from 7.3 in the bottom decile to&#13;
57.6 among urban households), while the average figure was 23 percent&#13;
(27 and 21 percent in urban and rural areas, respectively). On the other&#13;
hand, as shown in Table A.8 of the Statistical Appendix, over 92 percent&#13;
of the households had no elderly person aged 65 and over. The percentage&#13;
of households with one or two persons aged 65 or more varied between seven&#13;
and ten, with no systematic tendency.&#13;
Table A.9 and A.10 examine these data in a slightly different&#13;
manner in terms of the distribution of households by decile of per capita&#13;
expenditure and (i) child-dependency ratio and (ii) aged-dependency ratio.&#13;
Table A.9 shows that for 21 percent of all households, the child-dependency&#13;
ratio (CDR) was zero (and for another two percent of them, it could not&#13;
be defined because of an absence of any person aged 15-64). More importantly,&#13;
the proportion of households with a zero CDR increased steadily with decile.&#13;
Households with a high dependency ratio of one or more were over-represented&#13;
in the lower PCE deciles. Differences were somewhat sharper in urban&#13;
areas than in rural areas, although the broad trends were similar. The&#13;
aged-dependency ratio was zero for 91 percent (and undefinable for two&#13;
percent) of the households and showed little systematic variation with PCE&#13;
decile both in urban and rural areas.&#13;
These differences in the age composition of persons falling in&#13;
different deciles would, in turn, cause sizeable differences in their re-&#13;
quirements of food intake, etc. Ceteris paribus, they would also influence&#13;
the expenditure pattern and the level of labour force participation (for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
all age groups together) or the potentida per capita earnings of persons&#13;
in different deciles, which will be discussed in further detail below.&#13;
6. Educational Attainment&#13;
The Household Expenditure Survey did not collect information on&#13;
the literacy of the respondents, and recorded the highest certificate&#13;
obtained by those who went to school. As a result, it is difficult to&#13;
infer the number of years of schooling or the precise level of educational&#13;
attainment for almost 60 percent of the population aged 15 and over, which&#13;
is classified as having received some primary education. No one in this&#13;
category had received the "lower certificate of education", for passing an&#13;
examination held at the end of the third year of secondary school. Table&#13;
A.ll in the Statistical Appendix shows the distribution of persons aged 15&#13;
and over by PCE decile and educational attainment. Figure 3 shows the&#13;
percentages of persons in each decile who had received no formal schooling&#13;
and of those who had received the higher certificate of education or&#13;
diploma or some college education.&#13;
The data confirm the expected (a) inverse relationship between PCE&#13;
decile and the proportion of persons who had received no schooling, and&#13;
(b) the direct relationship between decile and the proportion of those who&#13;
had received a "lower certificate of education" (L.C.E.), a "higher certificate&#13;
of education" (H.C.E.)- some college education, or an equivalent diploma.&#13;
Only 25 percent had no formal schooling but the sex-differential in the&#13;
1/ A lower certificate of education (L.C.E.) is awarded on successful completion&#13;
of three years of secondary school education and a higher certificate of&#13;
education (H.C.E.) after six years of secondary school education.&#13;

proportion was quite sizeable, both in urban and rural areas. Religious&#13;
education, a distinct category, was reported by less than one percent of&#13;
the population, and not necessarily by persons in the bottom deciles as&#13;
might have been expected. On the other hand, few of those with a "higher&#13;
certificate of education", a diploma or a college degree, (earned by less&#13;
than ten percent of the population), were found among the bottom 40 percent.&#13;
Over three-fifths of persons with a H.C.E. or higher education resided in&#13;
urban households, which are clearly overrepresented among the top deciles&#13;
(when all sample households are grouped together).&#13;
As shown later in this paper, educational attainment is one of the&#13;
key explanatory variables for the level of per capita income or expenditure&#13;
of a household, and for earnings or wages and salaries of employees. It&#13;
would have been useful, therefore, to examine the decile-related differences&#13;
in school enrollments, which might indicate the likely future trends in&#13;
these differences. Unfortunately, however, the necessary data were not&#13;
collected in the HES.&#13;
C. Economic Characteristics&#13;
For reasons that are difficult to understand, the collection of&#13;
data on the labour force participation in the HES was limited to the age&#13;
group 15-64. Since the 1970 Census had enumerated 30 percent of persons aged&#13;
65 and over to be in the labour force, the rationale for collecting labour&#13;
force data for ages 15-64 is difficult to understand. However, since&#13;
persons aged 65 and over formed only 2.9 percent of the population, the&#13;
resulting underestimation of the labour force is unlikely to exceed about&#13;
one percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
1. Labour Force Participation Rates-/&#13;
The labour force participation rates shown in Table A.12 in the&#13;
Statistical Appendix and Figure 4 pertain to the population aged 15-64.&#13;
There is little systematic association between the PCE decile and the&#13;
particicipation rates, although the urban females in the top three deciles&#13;
reported significantly higher participation rates than average.&#13;
A different picture emerges in the "crude" participation rates,&#13;
(i.e. as a percentage of a decile). Largely because of the inverse&#13;
association between the proportion of children aged 0-14 and the PCE&#13;
decile, the crude participation rates for males, females and both sexes&#13;
together show a positive relationship with PCE decile.&#13;
Table A.13 shows the distribution of households by PCE decile&#13;
and labour force participation rate for ages 15-64. Only six to seven&#13;
percent of all households in urban and rural areas reported no one to be&#13;
in the labour force; such households were overrepresented in the bottom&#13;
PCE deciles in urban areas but there was no clear tendency among rural&#13;
households. Households with a labour force participation rate equal to&#13;
one (i.e. every one aged 15-64 in the labour force) showed a clear over-&#13;
representation in the top decile both in urban and rural areas; but there&#13;
was no clear relationship between PCE decile and the labour force partici-&#13;
pation rate of unity.&#13;
2. Number of Earners&#13;
It is quite likely, of course, that some of the persons classified&#13;
as outside the labour force during the reference week had some source of&#13;
income. This would be particularly true of the pensioners and other retired&#13;
1/ These rates are based on the reported activity of individuals during the&#13;
week that included the fifteenth day of the month in which the household&#13;
was interviewed.   The reference period was "one week."   Labour force&#13;
participation rates and the incidence of unemployment for persons aged&#13;
15-24 are reviewed in Annex 3.&#13;

persons receiving some income from assets. Therefore, Table A.14 in the&#13;
Statistical Appendix shows the distribution of households in each decile&#13;
according to the number of earners. The number of sample households with&#13;
no earner was negligible. But rather interestingly, the percentage of&#13;
households with only one earner increased with PCE decile, particularly in&#13;
rural areas. In urban areas, the proportion of households with only one&#13;
earner showed rather small inter-decile differences. To some extent, the&#13;
high proportion of single-earner households in the top decile is a reflection&#13;
of the size distribution of households in each decile (shown in Table A.2&#13;
in the Statistical Appendix). However, the number of earners might be higher&#13;
among the households in lower deciles precisely because of the low earnings&#13;
of the principal earner and/or the heavy burden of dependent children.!!&#13;
3. Incidence of Unemployment&#13;
Table A.12 and Figure 4 also show the incidence of unemployment&#13;
(unemployed as percent of the labour force in age group 15-64) by sex and&#13;
PCE decile, separately for urban, rural and all areas. The incidence of&#13;
unemployment seems to be markedly higher in the bottom decile and significantly&#13;
lower in the top decile or quintile for males as well as females in urban&#13;
areas and for males in all areas together. But in rural areas, there is no&#13;
clear indication of the expected inverse association between the level of&#13;
1/ As shown below, the difference between the number of earners, estimated&#13;
on the basis of the data presented in A.14 and persons in the labour&#13;
force was larger in rural areas than in urban areas.&#13;
Number of  Persons in the                    Labour Force as %&#13;
Area      Earners    Labour Force      Difference      of All Earners&#13;
All       15,326        13,160            2,166             85.9&#13;
Urban      4,847         4,331              516             89.4&#13;

A likely explanation is the fact that labour force participation was esti-&#13;
mated for the reference week whereas- the earnings data relate to the entire&#13;
month when a household was interviewed. For households with a self-employed&#13;
member or a business enterprise, the earnings could even relate to a full&#13;
year preceding the month of interview,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
per capita expenditure and the incidence of unemployment. (The highest&#13;
incidence of rural unemployment is seen in the sixth decile -- both for&#13;
males and females.)&#13;
Table A.15 shows the distribution of households by incidence of&#13;
unemployment and PCE decile. Over 78 percent of households both in urban&#13;
and rural areas reported a zero incidence of unemployment; in other words,&#13;
every member aged 15-64 who was in the labour force in these households&#13;
was employed. The inter-decile range of variation in the percentage of&#13;
households with zero unemployment was smaller in rural areas (76 to 82&#13;
percent) than in urban areas (69 to 86 percent); and the percentage&#13;
showed a mild tendency to rise with PCE decile in urban areas but not in&#13;
rural areas.&#13;
Only three to four percent of urban and rural households reported&#13;
an incidence of unemployment of the order of 60 percent or more (i.e.&#13;
three-fifths or more of their members who were in the labour force were&#13;
unemployed). Such households were overrepresented in the bottom PCE&#13;
decile and underrepresented in the top decile; but there was no clear&#13;
tendency in intermediate deciles.&#13;
Since the survey classified about 675 persons as unemployed, their&#13;
characteristics are reviewed at some,length in Annex 3 . Interestingly,&#13;
only 10 percent of the unemployed were heads of households; over 65 percent&#13;
were "sons" or "daughters" who were obviously supported by other earning&#13;
members in the family. This fact probably accounts for the observed weak&#13;
relationship between the incidence of unemployment and the PCE decile.&#13;
In any case, the differences in the levels of per capita expendi-&#13;
ture are much wider than those in the level of unemployment. It is necessary,&#13;
therefore, to examine the quality or structure of employment reported by&#13;
those classified as employed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
4. Incidence of Visible Underemployment&#13;
An interesting aspect of employment situation that can be examined&#13;
with the HES data is the incidence of visible underemployment or the proportion&#13;
of those willing to work more, among those working less than "full time".&#13;
Rather surprisingly, the HES collected data on the willingness to work more&#13;
only for persons who had reported working less than 25 hours. In other words,&#13;
work for 25 hours or more was considered "full-time work". Almost 88 percent&#13;
of all employed persons (91 percent of the males and 82 percent of the&#13;
females) were classified as full-time workers. The relevant data are shown&#13;
in Table A.16 in the Statistical Appendix.&#13;
The proportion of part-time workers varied inversely with PCE&#13;
decile. Part-time work was less prevalent in urban areas (6.5 percent of all&#13;
employed -- 4.2 percent of males and 11 percent of females) than in rural&#13;
areas (14.9 percent of all employed, 11.3 percent of males and 20.8 percent&#13;
of females).&#13;
Only 29.2 percent of the part-time workers (32.5 percent of the&#13;
males and 27.7 percent of the females) were willing to work more. However,&#13;
consistent with a priori expectations, the proportion of part-time workers&#13;
willing to work more varied inversely with the PCE decile. Furthermore,&#13;
the willingness to work for additional hours was more frequently reported&#13;
by the part-time workers in urban areas (38.5 percent) than by those in&#13;
rural areas (28.1 percent).&#13;
Of course, the concept of hours of work is necessarily imprecise&#13;
for the self-employed -- and some persons even reported themselves as working&#13;
all 24 hours of the day during the reference week.-/ However, compared to&#13;
1/ It has been learned that several Malaysian labour force surveys have also&#13;
included a few employed persons who reported that they had worked for 168&#13;
hours during the week.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
the Indian subcontinent or even neighbouring Thailand, the self-employed&#13;
form a relatively small proportion of all employed persons in Peninsular&#13;
Malaysia. Even in rural areas, the majority of workers happen to be&#13;
employees, for whom hours of work are quite well-defined.&#13;
5. Status Distribution of the Employed&#13;
Table A.17 in the Statistical Appendix and Figure 5 show the&#13;
distribution of the employed in each PCE decile by status or class of&#13;
worker. Both among male and female workers, the percentages of employees&#13;
and employers rise more or less steadily with PCE decile with those of the&#13;
self-employed and family helpers decline as PCE decile rises. These&#13;
tendencies are more marked in rural areas than in urban areas. Evidently,&#13;
the status of an employee carries with it a certain assurance of income&#13;
and other benefits, which are not available to the self-employed.-/ The HES&#13;
data lend support to the widespread impression that the self-employed are&#13;
overrepresented among the poor.&#13;
6. Industrial Classification of the Employed&#13;
Table A.18 shows the industrial distribution of the employed in&#13;
each PCE decile. Figure 6 shows the data for Peninsular Malaysia in a&#13;
geographical form. The proportion of "padi" (rice) farmers, rubber plantation&#13;
workers, as well as other agricultural workers varies inversely with decile.&#13;
The percentage of those working in traditional manufacturing shows very&#13;
small variation across deciles; but that of workers engaged in modern manu-&#13;
facturing rises steadily with decile. The proportion of workers in the&#13;
services sector also increases with decile. Once again, these tendencies&#13;
are sharper in rural areas than in urban areas.&#13;
1/ The well-known difficulties of estimating the income of the self-employed&#13;
and family helpers should not affect our data since the ranking is done&#13;
in terms of per capita expenditure. There could, of course, be some errors&#13;
in the imputed value of the consumption of goods produced in or sold through&#13;
the family enterprise.&#13;

7. Occupational Distribution of the Employed&#13;
The occupational distribution of the employed in each decile,&#13;
shown in Table A.19, has fewer categories than the industrial distribution-/&#13;
and for almost five percent of the workers, the occupation was neither known&#13;
nor adequately described. The main trends are shown in Figure 6. As would&#13;
be expected, the proportion of white-collar workers (particularly the pro-&#13;
fessional, technical, administrative, managerial and clerical) shows a&#13;
tendency to rise with PCE decile while that of agricultural workers declines&#13;
as PCE decile rises. The proportion of craftsmen and production process&#13;
workers first rises and then falls, forming an almost inverted U-shaped&#13;
curve with respect to PCE decile.     The decile differentials in the&#13;
occupational distribution of the male and female workers are somewhat similar.&#13;
8. Sources of Household Income&#13;
Table A.20 in the Statistical Appendix shows the distribution of&#13;
total income by source for different deciles in terms of per capita and&#13;
total income of the households. Excluding the bottom decile in terms of&#13;
both ranking criteria, the proportion of income originating in the profits&#13;
of unincorporated enterprises declines and that arising from wages and&#13;
salaries rises as decile rises. The bottom decile includes some households&#13;
reporting losses (negative income) from unincorporated enterprises; and they&#13;
contribute to the observed deviation from the pattern. The rise in the&#13;
share of wages slows down after the fourth decile in terms of per capita&#13;
income and the fifth decile in terms of total household income. Property&#13;
1/ The HES coding scheme has used a very detailed classification scheme for&#13;
coding both industry and occupation of a worker. However, in order to&#13;
avoid the problem of a small number of sample persons in various cells,&#13;
it is necessary to use a summary code.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
income (reported by only 1.4 percent of all households) is insignificant&#13;
in all but the top decile in terms of both criteria but its share shows&#13;
a mild but clear tendency to rise with PCY deciles. Consistent with&#13;
a priori expectations, transfers are more important for the bottom deciles&#13;
than for the upper deciles; but they account for over 50 percent of house-&#13;
holds in the bottom decile in terms of total household income.&#13;
D. An Overview&#13;
Table 6 summarizes the correlation and regression coefficients&#13;
showing the association between the various characteristics and the average&#13;
per capita expenditure of households in different deciles. With ten deciles,&#13;
the number of degrees of freedom was no more than eight. But the results&#13;
essentially confirm the conclusions noted in Section II.&#13;
1. There is a statistically significant negative association between per&#13;
capita expenditure and (i) the average household size, (ii) the dependency ratio&#13;
and (iii) the proportion of persons aged 15 and over with no schooling. A&#13;
negative association between the proportion of females among household heads&#13;
and per capita expenditure is statistically significant only in urban areas.&#13;
2. There is a significant, positive association between labour force&#13;
participation rates of females (and persons of both sexes) and per capita&#13;
expenditure in urban areas but not in rural or all areas.&#13;
3. The expected negative association between the incidence of unemploy-&#13;
ment and per capita expenditure is statistically significant for (a) males&#13;
(and all persons) in all areas and for (b) females (and all persons) in urban&#13;
areas; but not in rural areas.&#13;

No regressions have been estimated for the distribution of the&#13;
employed in terms of status, occupation, industry and per capita ex-&#13;
penditure because most of the differentials by decile are large and linear;&#13;
they are all expected to be statistically significant.&#13;
We shall supplement the present review of various characteristics&#13;
of households or population according to their PCE decile by a multivariate&#13;
analysis of the levels of per capita expenditure or income and the earnings&#13;
of employees (Sections IV and V). However, the incidence of poverty and&#13;
characteristics of poor households according to an absolute poverty&#13;
criterion will be examined first.&#13;

III.   Incidence of Absolute Poverty&#13;
This section examines the incidence of poverty and the character-&#13;
istics of poor households in terms of the absolute poverty criterion, with&#13;
a poverty line identified in terms of the level of expenditure required to&#13;
meet the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter. The results are com-&#13;
pared with some earlier estimates obtained in an earlier study on the basis of&#13;
the income data collected in the Post-Enumeration Survey of 1970 and also those&#13;
those presented in the Third Malaysia Plan.&#13;
A. Poverty Line&#13;
According to a recent World Bank study, the Malaysian officials considered&#13;
all households with an annual per capita income of US$265 in 1975 (when the Third&#13;
Malaysian Plan was published), i.e., equivalent to a monthly income of M$180 per&#13;
household in 1970 prices, as "below the minimum standard" or below the poverty&#13;
line.-/ Taking into account the average household size of 5.5 persons reported&#13;
by the 1970 Census or 5.4 estimated by the 1973 Household Expenditure Survey, the&#13;
poverty line in terms of per capita income or expenditure in 1970 prices would be&#13;
M$33.00.-/&#13;
Subsequently, in 1977, the poverty line was specified separately for&#13;
urban and rural areas at a level of a monthly household expenditure of M$246.1&#13;
for rural households and M$272.6 for urban households, or M$252.4 for the country&#13;

2/ Willem Bussink reports in a chapter in the book cited above that in 1978, the&#13;
Economic Planning Unit had lowered the poverty line from M$33 to M$29 per&#13;
capita per month in 1970 prices. The lower poverty line is equivalent to an&#13;
annual per capita income of US$230 in 1977 prices.&#13;

as a whole, all at current prices.-/ Dividing these figures.by the average size&#13;
of households, which did not differ significantly between rural and urban areas&#13;
according to the 1973 HES data presented in the previous section, and adjusting&#13;
for the rise in the consumer price index between 1973 and 1977 (about 31.9 percent),&#13;
we obtain a poverty line in terms of monthly per capita expenditure in 1973 of&#13;
M$38.33, M$34.58 and M$35.67 for urban, rural and all areas of Peninsular Malaysia. 2/&#13;
B. Incidence of Poverty in 1973&#13;
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the estimated percentages of poor households&#13;
which are defined as those with a monthly per capita expenditure below the poverty&#13;
line. Figure 7 shows the estimated proportions of poor households in (i) households&#13;
interviewed in different months, and (ii) households of different sizes, according&#13;
to urban-rural residence. Both Figure 7 and Table 1 illustrate one of the major&#13;
problems with the use of expenditure data to estimate poverty. The estimates of&#13;
the poor for each month of the interview can be considered valid estimates because&#13;
the sample canvassed during each month was an independent sub-sample. However,&#13;
the range of the estimates of the poor is quite wide, from 13 to 25 percent for&#13;
urban areas and from 37 to 53 percent for rural areas (between 31 and 44 percent&#13;
for all areas). This variation is partly due to the seasonality in expenditures,&#13;
associated mainly with festivals. For example, the festival of Ramaden, highly&#13;
important for the Muslims, happened to be in the month when the estimate of&#13;

poverty was the lowest. During the months of December and January the payment&#13;
of annual bonuses is likely to raise the incomes (and, therefore, expenditure)&#13;
and lead, in turn, to a decline in the proportion of the poor.&#13;
Estimates of the percentage of poor households according to their&#13;
size confirm the importance of household size in determining the level of per&#13;
capita expenditure and the incidence of poverty. The incidence of poverty&#13;
is much lower than the average among households with one or two members; it&#13;
exceeds the average among households with six or more members in urban areas,&#13;
and five or more members in rural areas. The increase in the incidence of&#13;
poverty slows down as the household size rises to ten members or more. The&#13;
results shown in Table 1 are consistent with those in the previous section&#13;
indicating an inverse association between PCE decile and household size.&#13;
Table 2 shows the incidence of poverty according to various character-&#13;
istics of household heads -- zone of residence, sex, age, education, labour&#13;
force and employment status, occupation and industry.-/ The incidence of poverty&#13;
is significantly above the average in the East zone and lower in the South and&#13;
the South-West. In urban areas, the North zone seems slightly better off than&#13;
even the South-West zone. In rural areas, poverty seems to be significantly&#13;
higher in the East, North and North-West than in the South and South-West zones.&#13;
Differences in the incidence of poverty according to the sex of the&#13;
household head are negligible; but the differences according to the age of the&#13;
household head are suggestive of the life cycle effect. The highest incidence&#13;
1/ It is worth repeating that over 84 percent of the household heads were also&#13;
the main earners of the households. Therefore, the characteristics of the&#13;
household head are good proxies for those of main earners. See Table A.4&#13;
in the Statistical Appendix.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
of poverty is reported for households with heads aged 40-44 in urban areas and&#13;
45-49 in rural areas. These are the age groups when the average household size&#13;
approaches its peak value. (Among both urban and rural households, the peak&#13;
household size -- 6.61 in urban areas and 6.52 in rural areas -- is reached in&#13;
the age group 45-49.I/) According to the results of our multiple classification&#13;
analysis, age of the household head explains very little of the variance in&#13;
per capita income (PCY) and expenditure (PCE). In contrast, the size of the&#13;
household is a more important explanatory variable for the variance in PCE and&#13;
PCY. Therefore, the differences in the incidence of poverty according to the&#13;
age of the household head essentially reflect the effect of associated differ-&#13;
entials in household size.&#13;
As would be expected, the incidence of poverty declines with an in-&#13;
crease in the educational level of the household head. Education of the head&#13;
beyond the primary level is associated with a substantial decline in the&#13;
incidence of poverty, although only 10 percent of all households are in that&#13;
category. Over 60 percent of the poor households in rural areas and almost 68&#13;
percent of those in urban areas had received some formal education -- up to nine&#13;
years (i.e. up to the third year of the secondary school, although they had not&#13;
received the "lower certificate of education" indicating success in the examination&#13;
1/ See Table 1 of Section II above for data on the average household size&#13;
according to the age group of the household head.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
at the end of nine years of schooling).-    Compared to the poor in the Indian&#13;
subcontinent, the educational attainment of poor heads of households in&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia appears to be better, and communications with them should be&#13;
easier than in the subcontinent.&#13;
An examination of the incidence of poverty according to the economic&#13;
characteristics of the heads of households shows it to be above the average&#13;
among (i) the self-employed and family helpers; (ii) agricultural workers in&#13;
both rural and urban areas, and miscellaneous service workers or craftsmen and&#13;
blue collar workers in urban areas; (iii) padi or rubber farmers, fishermen,&#13;
workers in traditional manufacturing activities, and construction workers.&#13;
However, about half of the rural poor households were headed by a self-employed&#13;
worker, and an almost similar proportion of the urban poor households were headed&#13;
by an employee. Most of these economic characteristics are highly correlated&#13;
with educational attainment, and the MCA results show education to be the most&#13;
important of the explanatory variables considered in our analysis of the variance&#13;
of PCY or PCE.&#13;

poverty line. It can be used to estimate the percentage of poor households under&#13;
different poverty lines, from 5 to 30 percent lower than those used in Tables 1&#13;
and 2.-/&#13;
While the use of a lower poverty line naturally implies a lower incidence&#13;
of poverty, the broad pattern of poverty remains unaltered even with a 30 percent&#13;
lower poverty line than the one used in Tables 1 and 2.&#13;
Poverty figures in Table 3 include some estimates according to the two&#13;
economic characteristics of main earners, 2/i.e., industry and class of worker&#13;
(to avoid the problem of small sample size, only employees and the self-employed&#13;
have been considered). Interestingly, households with a self-employed main earner&#13;
producing rubber, undertaking fishing, or manufacturing traditional products&#13;
were more likely to be poorer than households with their main earner engaged in&#13;
the same activities as an employee. A similar but small difference is observed&#13;
among households in "other agriculture." Among padi (rice) farming households,&#13;
however, those with main earners working as employees were presumably landless&#13;
and, therefore, slightly more likely to be poor than those with a self-employed&#13;
main earner.&#13;
D. Incidence of Poverty According to an Income Criterion and Its Sensitivity&#13;
In some of the work by the East Asia and Pacific Region Office of the&#13;
World Bank, a poverty line of a monthly household income of M$187.80 (M$202.80&#13;
for urban areas and M$183.10 for rural areas) at 1973 prices has been used. With&#13;
1/ Different poverty lines were used for urban and rural areas. For other&#13;
characteristics of household heads, the urban/rural distinction has not been&#13;
considered.&#13;
2/ The main earner has been determined according to the total of reported and&#13;
imputed income.&#13;

an average household size of 5.4 persons, the poverty lines in terms of per capita&#13;
monthly income are M$37.56, M$33.91, and M$34.78, respectively. These lines are&#13;
only slightly lower than those in terms of monthly per capita expenditure cited&#13;
above.&#13;
As noted earlier, the ranking of households changes if per capita ex-&#13;
penditure rather than per capita income is used as the ranking criterion. (The&#13;
percentage of households in the same decile according to the two criteria was&#13;
no more than 36.7 -- 36.6 in urban areas and 33.0 in rural areas.) Therefore,&#13;
households classified as poor in terms of per capita expenditure may not all be&#13;
poor according to their per capita income. However, the overall proportions of&#13;
poor households according to the two sets of poverty lines (in terms of PCE and&#13;
PCY, respectively) are very similar -- 37.5 and 36.2 percent for Peninsular&#13;
Malaysia as a whole (19.7 and 17.8 percent for urban households and 45.3 and 45.5&#13;
percent for rural households).&#13;
An attempt has also been made to estimate the difference in the&#13;
estimated percentages of the poor households that would result from adopting&#13;
somewhat lower poverty lines, up to 30 percent lower than those being presently&#13;
used in the Bank work. The sensitivity of the estimates of poverty to different&#13;
poverty lines can be seen in Table 4, which indicates the percentage of house-&#13;
holds whose per capita income was short of the poverty line by varying percentages.&#13;
Once again, although a lower poverty line naturally reduces the percentage of&#13;
poor households, the incidence of poverty remains relatively much higher in rural&#13;
areas than in urban areas and among households having their main earner-/employed&#13;
as a fisherman or an agricultural worker growing padi or coconut and rubber or&#13;

imputed income.&#13;

oil palm. As would be expected, poverty also appears to be relatively high&#13;
among rural households whose main earner is employed in sales or manufacturing&#13;
activities (as a production process worker or a craftsman).&#13;
E. Comparison with Earlier Estimates&#13;
Our estimates of the incidence of poverty are roughly comparable to&#13;
those of Sudhir Anand, who found 36.5 percent of the households in 1970 (15.8&#13;
percent of urban households and 44.6 percent of rural households) to be below&#13;
the poverty line defined then as a per capita income of M$25.00.-/ While our&#13;
categories for different variables are somewhat different from those of Anand,&#13;
the general differences are similar. One major difference occurs with respect&#13;
to the sex of the household head: Anand found a significantly higher difference&#13;
in the incidence of poverty among households with female heads, while our results&#13;
show a much smaller difference.&#13;
A similarity of the general results occurs despite the fact that the&#13;
poverty line, defined in terms of per capita expenditure, is about 23 percent&#13;
higher than Anand's, after allowance for the rise in the consumer price index.&#13;
This may be partly due to the fact that expenditure is more easily recalled and&#13;
reported. Even with the poverty line defined in terms of per capita income,&#13;
(which is 20 percent higher than Anand's, in real terms), we obtain an almost&#13;
identical estimate of the incidence of poverty as did Anand, because the 1973&#13;
income data are a better approximation to reality. (As noted earlier, each&#13;
sample household was visited several times during the one-month reference period.)&#13;

The income data of the Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) of 1970, used by Anand,&#13;
were collected during a single visit with little scope to check them with other&#13;
information; in all probability, incomes were understated to a significant&#13;
extent.&#13;

IV. Multivariate Analysis of Per Capita Income and Expenditure&#13;
This section reports the results of the multiple classification&#13;
analysis (MCA)1- of per capita income and expenditure, separately for urban&#13;
and rural areas, in Peninsular Malaysia. Eight or nine variables (eight&#13;
when rural and urban areas are considered separately and nine for all areas)&#13;
take account of the characteristics of the household as a whole while an&#13;
additional seven variables denote the characteristics of the household&#13;
head. As shown in Table A.4 in the Statistical Appendix, almost 85 percent&#13;
of the household heads were also the main earners and therefore the results&#13;
were not much different from those obtained by using the characteristics&#13;
of main earners.&#13;
1/ The MCA assumes an additive model and the program is "normally insensitive&#13;
to interaction effects," unless the correlation between two or more pre-&#13;
dictors is extremely high. A key feature of the MCA technique is its&#13;
ability to show the effect of each explanatory variable on the dependent&#13;
variable both before and after the effects of all other explanatory&#13;
variables are taken into account. (The variables are measured as&#13;
sets of classes of categories.) In the case of correlated predictors,&#13;
one could observe either an 'overlap effect' (e.g., when the relationship&#13;
between the two predictors is positive and they are both positively&#13;
related to the dependent variable). In the former case, the two variables&#13;
considered together will explain less than the sum of the two, each&#13;
considered separately, whereas in the latter case, the variables&#13;
together will explain more of the variation in the dependent variable&#13;
than the sume of the two considered separately.&#13;
The rank order of the beta coefficients, estimated for each predictor&#13;
variable, indicates the relative importance of the various predictors in&#13;
their explanation of the dependent variable if all other predictors were&#13;
"held constant."&#13;
The MCA technique requires a partitioning of even continuous variables&#13;
such as the dependency ratios, participation rates and incidence of unemploy-&#13;
ment in categories. We have attempted to demarcate the groups in a manner&#13;
that would minimize the problem of (a) too few sample households in a category&#13;
and (b) too unequal a distribution of sample households. Because of the&#13;
bunching of households around certain values of these continuous variables,&#13;
the latter problem is very difficult to avoid. See: Frank M. Andrews, et. al.,&#13;
MuZtipZe CZassification AnaZysis, Second Edition (Ann Arbor: Institute for&#13;
Social Research, 1973), p. 17.&#13;

A. Explanatory Variables at the Household Level&#13;
The choice and definition of some of the explanatory variables&#13;
considered in the MCA require some elaboration. Among the variables defined&#13;
for the household as a unit, rural urban residence, ethnic group, and household&#13;
size require no comment. The month of interview was included in the explanatory&#13;
variables because of the sizeable differences in the level of per capita ex-&#13;
penditure and income of households interviewed in different months noted elsewhere&#13;
in the paper.&#13;
Five other variables were defined for each household. Table 1 shows&#13;
the percentage of sample households for which these variables had a value of&#13;
zero or could not be defined. Two variables take into account the burden of&#13;
dependency in terms of the ratio of (a) children aged 0-14 and (b) the elderly&#13;
aged 65 and over, per person aged 15-64 (which are regarded as the ages of labour&#13;
force participation). The two variables labelled as the child-dependency ratio&#13;
and the aged-dependency ratio cannot be defined for about 2.2 percent (160) of&#13;
the households which had no member aged 15-64. For other households, the two&#13;
ratios ranged from (a) 0 to 9.0, and (b) 0 to 2.0, respectively. Approximately&#13;
21.1 percent of all households had no member aged less than 15 yeras, while&#13;
90.9 percent of the households had no one aged 65 years or more. (About 19.2&#13;
percent of the households had no one aged less than 15, or 65 and above.)&#13;
The three variables defined for the age group 15-64 are: the labour&#13;
force participation rate, the incidence of unemployment, and the average number&#13;
of hours worked by the employed. The labour force participation by persons aged&#13;
less than 15 or 65 and over is ignored since they were not covered by the labour&#13;
force survey. Only the labour force participation rate for persons of both sexes&#13;
aged 15-64 is taken into account to minimize the number of households for whom&#13;

the variable cannot be defined.- The variable ranged between 0 and 1, with 6.2&#13;
percent of the households reporting a zero participation rate and 34.4 percent&#13;
reporting a rate of unity.&#13;
The incidence of unemployment is defined only for households which had&#13;
at least one member in the labour force (i.e. it cannot be defined for 8.7&#13;
percent of the households which had no member aged 15-64, or no one in the&#13;
labour force, or for whom the information was not recorded). It ranged between&#13;
0 and 1, with around 78.8 percent of the households reporting no unemployed member&#13;
and 3.1 percent reporting all the members in the labour force to be unemployed.&#13;
Finally, the average number of hours worked by an employed member&#13;
during the reference week was estimated to provide a crude index of underemployment.&#13;
(It is not possible to estimate underemployment in terms of those willing to work&#13;
more because the relevant information was collected only for persons working less&#13;
than 25 hours during the reference week, i.e. about 12 percent of all employed&#13;
persons.) The variable could not be defined for 11.7 percent of the households.&#13;
Interestingly, for about 1.3 percent of the households, the average number of&#13;
hours worked exceeded 84, or 12 hours per day; in four households, the employed&#13;
had reported themselves as working 24 hours a day. Obviously, there must be&#13;
some exaggeration here, probably by persons working as policemen or undertaking&#13;
other duties when they are "on call" all 24 hours of the day.-/ In our analysis,&#13;
all households with the employed reporting work for 42 hours or more have been&#13;
grouped together as suffering from no underemployment.&#13;
1/ Almost 15.3 percent of the households had no male member aged 15-64, and&#13;
11.2 percent had no female member in that age group. These figures include&#13;
about 26 households for which labour force data could not be collected.&#13;
2/ Such oddities do not constitute a criticism of the survey investigators,&#13;
supervisors or coders. They bring to light some problems in defining hours&#13;
worked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-59-&#13;
Seven additional variables considered in the MCA are characteristics&#13;
of the household head: sex, age, marital status, education, employment status,&#13;
occupation and industry. Of these variables, marital status was introduced just&#13;
for completeness -- to take account of all the available information -- and was&#13;
retained in the final analysis because if one does not adjust (i.e. control) for&#13;
other factors, it seems to explain over five percent of the variance in the per&#13;
capita income of rural households. Marital status of the household head is&#13;
likely to be related to his sex and age as well as the size of the householdl/&#13;
and generally ceases to be significant when adjusted or controlled for other&#13;
factors. Among other variables, the employment status categories include not&#13;
only the four classes of worker relationships but also the unemployed (as "Other"),&#13;
those outside the labour force (housewife, pensioner and students), and those&#13;
whose labour force status was not recorded (either because they were outside the&#13;
labour force ages or for other reasons). The occupational and industrial classi-&#13;
fication of household heads is easy to define for the employed; however, some&#13;
ill-defined categories of "miscellaneous" occupations or "blank and not stated"&#13;
cases have been retained as separate classes.&#13;
B. Results of MCA&#13;
Table 2 summarizes the results of MCA of per capita expenditure and&#13;
income, separately by urban-rural residence. The number of categories used for&#13;
each variable is also shown. Variables have been ranked according to the estimated&#13;
1/ Some 18.1 percent of all household heads were females (20.5 percent in urban&#13;
areas and 16.9 percent in rural areas). Sixty percent of the female heads&#13;
were widowed, divorced or separated (48.7 percent of those in urban areas and&#13;
66.6 percent of those in rural areas).&#13;

The variance in dependent variables explained by each predictor before adjustment&#13;
for other variables is shown in Tables A.21 and A.22 in the Statistical Appendix.&#13;
Table 2 also shows the interaction effect, estimated as the difference&#13;
between (a) the total   R   or explained variance and (b) the sum of    2 values,&#13;
i.e. of the variance explained by all the predictor variables. In five out&#13;
of six sets of results reported in Table 2, the total explained variance or    R&#13;
exceeded the sum of    2 values, i.e. there were suppressor effects with predictors&#13;
negatively related to each other and positively related to the dependent variable.&#13;
Only the MCA of per capita income of urban households showed an overlap effect,&#13;
with the total   R   less than the sum of  a2  values.&#13;
Table 2 also shows whether the variance explained by a predictor alone&#13;
was a significant portion of the variance of the dependent variable. An F&#13;
test is used for that purpose; but the degree to which the data meet the&#13;
assumptions of an F test has not been evaluated and the results provide only&#13;
a rough indication of the statistical significance of each variable.&#13;
C. Explained Variance in Per Capita Expenditure and Income&#13;
According to Table 2, the explanatory variables used in our analysis&#13;
explains a substantially larger part of the total variance in per capita ex-&#13;
penditure of households than of the variance in per capita income. For rural&#13;
households, however, the difference in   R   values for per capita expenditure&#13;
and income is relatively quite small.&#13;
1/ When two or more variables explain the same percentage of variance in a&#13;
dependent variable, each one of them is given the same rank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-&#13;
Considering first the variance in PCE, educational attainment of the&#13;
household head proves to be the most important explanatory variable in urban,&#13;
rural and all areas. Ethnic group, child-dependency ratio of the household,&#13;
and household size and the second, third and fourth most important explanatory&#13;
variables, respectively, of per capita expenditure. Economic characteristics&#13;
of the household head, namely his class of worker, occupation and industry&#13;
are next in order of importance. But age group of the household head, generally&#13;
used as an indicator of the life cycle effects, turns out to be less important&#13;
than the child-dependency ratio and the size of households. Of course, the&#13;
latter two variables are related to the age of the household head; and when&#13;
they are ignored, age group of the head may seem to be an important explanatory&#13;
variable.&#13;
Turning to the variance in PCY, educational attainment of the head&#13;
of the household is once again the most important explanatory variable, and the&#13;
child-dependency ratio of the household is the second in importance. In urban&#13;
areas, occupation and ethnic group of the household head are of almost equal&#13;
importance and rank third and fourth among explanatory variables. In rural&#13;
areas, however, ethnic group is a more important predictor of PCY than the&#13;
economic characteristics of the household head, i.e. class of worker, occupation&#13;
and industry, in that order. Household size is as important as occupation of&#13;
the household head in rural areas and as important as class of worker in urban&#13;
areas. Labour force participation rate of a household is fifth among predictors&#13;
of PCY in urban areas but less important than the economic characteristics of&#13;
heads of households in rural areas. Age of the head turns out to be a relatively&#13;
less important explanatory variable of the per capita income of a household than&#13;
is usually believed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-&#13;
A few general inferences can be drawn from the results of our MCA.&#13;
First, the  R   values are relatively low because the available data do not&#13;
include any information on the assets of different households. Even the edu-&#13;
cational data do not show the years of schooling of those who went to school&#13;
and the years of experience on the job for those who have been reported as&#13;
employed. Likewise, we have not considered the educational and other character-&#13;
istics of the members of a household other than its head.&#13;
Second, the child-dependency ratios turn out to be a more important&#13;
explanatory variable than the labour force participation rate (for persons&#13;
aged 15-64) or the incidence of unemployment, partly because the variation&#13;
in the latter variables is indeed less than in child-dependency ratios.&#13;
Third, ethnic group probably serves as a surrogate for a combination&#13;
of several other variables and is, therefore, more important than several&#13;
other variables.&#13;
Fourth, the primary importance of education as an explanatory variable&#13;
of the differences in per capita expenditure and income might inspire hope that&#13;
with an improvement in the availability of educational opportunities to differ-&#13;
ent segments of the society, disparities in income and expenditure would&#13;
probably decline. While an increased supply of educated and skilled workers&#13;
would help to eliminate some of the element of "rent" enjoyed by the better-&#13;
educated in the prevailing situation, appropriate public policies would remain&#13;
crucial for avoiding the wastage of investment in education through a rise in&#13;
the incidence of unemployment among the educated.&#13;
Fifth, the low explanatory power of the average hours worked during&#13;
the week by the employed with respect to both PCE and PCY probably indicates&#13;
the difficulty of measuring the intensity of work or underemployment. Also,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
the hours worked relate to one week within the reference week, while the&#13;
per capita income and expenditure are determined by activities of different&#13;
members over a much longer period of time as well as by the assets of house-&#13;
holds.&#13;
In the next section, we shall examine the results of a multivariate&#13;
analysis of earnings of employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-&#13;
V. Multivariate Analysis of Earnings of Employees&#13;
A significant problem in income surveys is the difficulty of identi-&#13;
fying the income earned by unpaid helpers in household enterprises or other&#13;
activities. To some extent, the problem arises even for employers or own-&#13;
account workers if more than one member in a household undertakes joint economic&#13;
activity in some capacity other than as an employee.-/ For employees, the earnings&#13;
are clearly identifiable and are usually stable over time, unless the person is&#13;
a casual labourer. Quite probably, they are also more accurately reported. It&#13;
is useful, therefore, to examine the factors contributing to differences in the&#13;
earnings of employees.&#13;
A. Proportion of Employees Among Workers&#13;
Although the present analysis is restricted to the earnings of employees,&#13;
(more precisely, total compensation of employees, including payments in kind and&#13;
social security or provident fund contributions), it is, nevertheless, of con-&#13;
siderable interest because persons, whose "principal employment status" was as&#13;
an employee. accounted for over 55 percent of all employed persons (73 percent&#13;
of the urban employed and almost 47 percent of the rural employed).-/ Table A.17&#13;
in the Statistical Appendix indicates a positive association between the pro-&#13;
portion of employees among the employed and the PCE decile of the households.&#13;
Further, as noted in Section II, the share of wages and salaries in the, total&#13;
household income also tends to rise rather steadily with the decile of households&#13;
in terms of per capita income or expenditure (see Table A.20).&#13;
1/  The convention is to recorc income resulting from joint activities of household&#13;
members, which cannot be allocated, against the head of the household.&#13;
2/ Almost 66.5 percent of all sample households reported some income from wages&#13;
and salaries. This proportion also steadily increases with the decile of per&#13;
capita expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66-&#13;
It is important to note that the wages or salaries earned by house-&#13;
hold members were not received only by those who were classified as employees&#13;
in terms of their principal employment status. Table 1 indicates that only&#13;
85 percent of persons reporting some wage or salary income were employees&#13;
according to their principal employment status. The average wage or salary&#13;
earnings of others were much lower than those of employees. To consider, in&#13;
one single group, the wage and salary earnings of everyone reporting them would&#13;
introduce some unnecessary noise in the analysis; thus, we decided to consider&#13;
only those who were principally employees.&#13;
B. Results of the Multiple Classification Analysis&#13;
Table 2 below summarizes the results of MCA, separately for male, female&#13;
and all employees, according to their area of residence. While most of the&#13;
variables taken into account are self-explanatory, the willingness to work (for&#13;
more hours) was identified only for employees who had been working less than&#13;
25 hours per week because of "insufficient work/nature of the job.'"    Only three&#13;
percent of all employees had, therefore, answered the question.&#13;
The R values or the percentages of variance in earnings explained&#13;
by the predictor variables taken into account are significantly higher than the&#13;
corresponding values obtained in the MCA of PCE and PCY. A major explanation&#13;
is the direct relevance of the characteristics of an individual to his earnings&#13;
as an individual. Per capita expenditure or income, on the other hand, depend&#13;
on several variables unrelated to the characteristics of the household head that&#13;
1/ The precise question was as follows: "If working for less than 25 hours, are&#13;
you able and willing to accept additional number of hours of work?".&#13;

were considered above. A second explanation for the observed phenomenon is&#13;
the relatively large interaction effect (or the explained variance not attributable&#13;
to any of the explanatory variables) considered in Table 2 below; it is particularly&#13;
large for urban employees -- both males and females -- and for all employees in&#13;
the country as a whole. Apparently, the suppressor effects are quite large, and&#13;
some experimentation with the construction of new variables by considering two&#13;
or more characteristics at the same time may be useful.&#13;
Without adjustment for other factors, the four variables that seem to&#13;
explain a significant part of the variance in earnings are: educational attainment,&#13;
ethnic group, occupation and industry of the employee, both in urban and rural&#13;
areas. An adjustment for other factors lowers the importance of all the factors;&#13;
but for male employees, education and ethnic group stand out as the most important&#13;
explanatory variables, with occupation, age and industry next in importance, in&#13;
that order. For female employees, education and occupation are the most important&#13;
explanatory variables, with ethnic group declining to a relatively irsignificant&#13;
factor in urban areas and a significant but minor one in rural areas.&#13;
Table A.23 in the Statistical Appendix shows the average monthly&#13;
earnings (in Malaysian dollars) of employees according to various character-&#13;
istics. These figures are likely to be of general interest and indicate the&#13;
pattern of differences. The data suggest an approximation to an inverted&#13;
U-shaped curve of earnings with respect to age, separately for males&#13;
and females and for urban and rural areas.&#13;

VI. Pattern of Consumption Expenditure&#13;
This section examines briefly the pattern of consumption expenditure&#13;
in urban and rural areas of Peninsular Malaysia by households in different&#13;
deciles ranked according to per capita as well as total expenditure. Engel&#13;
coefficients or elasticities have been estimated for per capita as well as total&#13;
expenditure on goods and services in different categories.&#13;
A. Expenditure Categories&#13;
The choice of some 32 categories of expenditure for summarizing the&#13;
data collected by the Household Expenditure Survey had been made by other&#13;
colleagues in the Development Research Center before the tapes began to be used&#13;
for the present project. The same 32 categories have been used in our analysis.-/&#13;
Table A.24 in the Statistical Appendix shows a summary of selected&#13;
statistics such as the number of households reporting some or no expenditure in&#13;
each category, the minimum and the maximum values of total expenditure reported&#13;
by households and the mean expenditure (as well as its standard deviation) esti-&#13;
mated separately for (a) households reporting some expenditure and (b) all sample&#13;
households. The reported minimum value of expenditure is always one Malaysian&#13;
dollar because those reporting zero expenditure are excluded;-/ and the figures&#13;
were rounded to whole dollars.&#13;
1/ According to the "Coding Manual" for the Expenditure Survey, expenditure on&#13;
the leasing of air conditioners, furniture, and other household equipment was&#13;
grouped with that on "household goods and cleaning materials." Quite&#13;
probably, however, the leasing of such goods is not very widespread in&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia and the distortion, if any, in the results is quite&#13;
small.&#13;
2/ For a total of 61 households, the tapes either did not include any expenditure&#13;
or income data or reported a negative income. A negative income or a loss is&#13;
not impossible for a short reference period of one month. However, all such&#13;
households have been excluded from the present analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-&#13;
The range of variation in total expenditure by households was under-&#13;
standably larger in urban areas than in rural areas and larger for categories&#13;
such as "packaged tours and financial and other services," "major durables and&#13;
recreation equipment," "transportation items (including cars and motorcycles),"&#13;
or "parts and repair (of transportation equipment)."&#13;
B. Pattern of Consumption&#13;
Tables A.25 and A.26 in the Statistical Appendix show the per capita&#13;
and total expenditure on each of the 32 categories of expenditure by households&#13;
falling in different deciles with the ranking in terms of per capita expenditure.&#13;
Tables A.27 and A.28 in the Statistical Appendix provide the same information&#13;
for deciles of households ranked according to their total expenditure. The&#13;
percentage share of expenditure on a given category of goods and/or services is&#13;
the same in tables showing per capita and total expenditure under a particular&#13;
ranking criterion.&#13;
Five categories of expenditure (food, clothing, and shelter as well as&#13;
transportation and tours and financial services) accounted for almost 77 percent&#13;
of total expenditure in Peninsular Malaysia as a whole. The urban-rural difference&#13;
in the average consumption pattern is relatively small. Urban households spent&#13;
40 percent of total expenditure on food, whereas for rural households, food accounted&#13;
for 47 percent of the total expenditure. Much of this difference was compensated&#13;
by a higher share of housing in the expenditure in urban areas (13.9 percent)&#13;
than in rural areas (9.7 percent).&#13;
C. Engel Curves&#13;
Figure 8 shows the Engel curves for five categories of expenditure for&#13;
per capita and total expenditure deciles, respectively. The inter-decile differ-&#13;
ences in the share of different categories in total expenditure are striking with&#13;
&#13;

respect to food and tours and financial services. The Engel curves for food and&#13;
housing expenditures in rural areas differ significantly according to whether the&#13;
deciles have been demarcated according to per capita or the total expenditure of&#13;
the household.&#13;
D. Elasticity Estimates&#13;
Table 1 summarizes the estimates of elasticities of (a) per capita and&#13;
(b) total expenditure on various categories of items with respect to the total&#13;
expenditure reported for various PCE and THE deciles.-/ The commodity groups&#13;
identified as facing inelastic (i.e., those with elasticity equal to less than&#13;
one) demand (food, tobacco, and utilities) are essentially the same whether we&#13;
use the PCE or the THE ranking criterion; but for housing, the demand indicated&#13;
by rent payments appears to be inelastic with the THE ranking but it has an&#13;
elasticity coefficient very close to one with PCE ranking. Demand for domestic&#13;
service, major durables and recreation equipment, and for entertainment and&#13;
gambling show the relatively greater elasticity. The elasticity coefficients&#13;
for the latter two categories of expenditure (excluding domestic service) are&#13;
higher for rural areas than for urban areas. Also, the estimates are a little&#13;
higher with the THE ranking than with PCE ranking.2/&#13;
Estimates of elasticity of total expenditures on various items are&#13;
generally very similar to those obtained for the elasticity of per capita&#13;
expenditure. For some items such as postal, telephone and telegraph fees,&#13;
1/ These estimates of elasticity with respect to total expenditure of households&#13;
in different deciles are a proxy for estimates of income-elasticity. We have&#13;
used data for deciles of households to avoid the problem of non-comparability&#13;
arising from differences in the households reporting some expenditure on&#13;
different items.&#13;
2/ Expenditures on schooling and boarding fees seem to be much more elastic with&#13;
the THE ranking than with PCE ranking.&#13;

the elasticity of per capita expenditure is statistically not significant at&#13;

both PCE and THE ranking criteria.&#13;
The results presented above indicate the importance of using the&#13;
per capita expenditure criterion rather than the total expenditure criterion.&#13;
The issue would be even more important if the data on consumption patterns&#13;
were to be used to estimate the commodity requirements of a welfare or social&#13;
assistance program. This is due to the fact, noted earlier in this paper,&#13;
that the proportion of total population represented by the poor households as&#13;
well as its age composition (and therefore the "requirements") differ substantially&#13;
according to whether they are identified on the basis of per capita or the&#13;
total household expenditure (or income).&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
SOME PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF THE HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE AND&#13;
INCOME SURVEYS IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA, 1973 and 1974&#13;
The primary objective of the Household Expenditure Survey (HES)&#13;
conducted in Malaysial/ during 1973 was to obtain the weights to construct&#13;
the cost of living indices. In addition, an elaborate schedule of the sources&#13;
and amount of income during the reference period of one month was included&#13;
to enable an analysis of the distribution of income among different groups&#13;
of people.- All persons aged 15-64 in the households included in the HES&#13;
were asked about their labour force particulars for a fixed reference&#13;
period of one week (which included the 15th day of the month).-     At some&#13;
stage, it was decided to collect data also on the "usual employment status,&#13;
occupation and industry,"- and the available tapes include information on&#13;
these characteristics according to both the usual status and the activities&#13;
of the reference week. The simultaneous collection of data on expenditure,&#13;
income and labour force particulars of a fairly large number of sample&#13;
households makes the HES a rich source of information on the living standards&#13;
and the economic characteristics of the Malaysian households.&#13;
The HES was followed by a Household Income Survey (HIS), which&#13;
interviewed all the households (i.e., households resident at the addresses&#13;
1/ In Sabah and Sarawak, the survey was limited to six main towns. Our&#13;
analysis pertains only to West Malaysia. The HES, originally planned&#13;
for 1972-73, was actually conducted during the calendar year 1973.&#13;
2/ The Instruction Manual for the HES makes explicit reference to the objective&#13;
of analysing the distribution of income "between urban and rural population,&#13;
between races" etc.   See: Malaysia, Department of Statistics, Household&#13;
Expenditure Survey, 1972-73, tIalaysia, Instruction i4fanual (Kuala Lumpur,&#13;
undated), p. 1. Much of the information in this annex is based on this&#13;
Instruction Manual.&#13;
3/ The labour force data were collected during the week following the&#13;
reference week.&#13;
4/ No information is yet available on the precise definitions. A report&#13;
containing the summarized statistics of the HES, issues by the Malaysian&#13;
Department of Statistics, makes no reference to the collection of data&#13;
for the reference period of one week.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

which were visited during the HES) during the period January-April 1974 in&#13;
order to collect data on the household income and expenditure on durables&#13;
during the calendar year 1973 (a fixed reference period of 12 months). The&#13;
consumer durable expenditure data collected in the HIS have been substituted&#13;
for the HES data on the subject.&#13;
SonpZe Size&#13;
Twelve independent subsamples, together adding up to 7,880 living&#13;
quarters, were selected according to a multi-stage stratified sampling pro-&#13;
cedure. Each independent subsample, forming one-twelfth of the sample, was&#13;
surveyed during each calendar month in 1973. A total of 7,644 households&#13;
were found eligible: The non-response was quite low. After editing, the data&#13;
relating to 7,285 households (7,273 households when the expenditure and income&#13;
data are matched or compared), over 95 percent of the total, have been used&#13;
for most of the analysis presented in this paper.&#13;
Possibilities for Comparisons of Data&#13;
The quality of the survey data can be partly assessed by comparing&#13;
the survey data with those of the 1970 Census of Population. Unfortunately,&#13;
however, the HES/HIS definition of an urban area was based largely on the&#13;
population size of a locality in 1957 ("following the Socio-Economic Sample Survey&#13;
of Households Malaysia - MSSH"). -/   It is not easy, therefore, to compare&#13;
the survey data for rural and urban areas with those of the 1970 Census and only&#13;
the data for the whole country can be compared (see Annex 3).&#13;
1/ See: Malaysia, Department of Statistics, HousehoZd Expenditure Survey, 1973,&#13;
Malaysia: Summary Statistics (Kuala Lumpur, undated), p. 52.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79-&#13;
For the survey as a whole, the spreading of the interviews over an&#13;
entire calendar year should help to average out some of the seasonal fluctuations&#13;
in income and expenditure. Similarly, the data on income during a whole year,&#13;
collected in the HIS (but not examined in this paper), should be less subject&#13;
to seasonality, although the problems of recalling the income during the past&#13;
could introduce considerable biases, which normally lead to an understatement of&#13;
income. There arises, therefore, a real dilemma here. From a pragmatic angle,&#13;
a survey cannot collect reliable information on income and expenditure for an&#13;
extended period of time (such as a year), unless the same households are revisited&#13;
so as to make it a panel study. For purposes of evaluating the welfare impli-&#13;
cations of a given level of income or expenditure, however, economists and&#13;
other social scientists would be interested in the situation over a longer&#13;
period of time, ideally even longer than a year. This author sees no alternative&#13;
to a panel study for assessing the long-term situation; but the subject deserves&#13;
careful experimentation with an analysis of actual experiences in different&#13;
socio-cultural settings. 1/&#13;
Finally, the income and savings data based on the survey can be&#13;
compared with those based on the national accounts, with due attention given&#13;
to the limitations of the coverage of the survey information caused by the ex-&#13;
clusion of institutional households, corporations, etc.&#13;
Before attempting such comparisons, some of the concepts and definitions&#13;
used in the HES/HIS need to be outlined.&#13;
1/ Differences between the income reported in the HES and average monthly income&#13;
for the calendar year 1973, derived from the HIS, deserve a careful study by&#13;
the Department of Statistics of the Government of Malaysia.&#13;

Procedures for Recording Expenditure and Estimating the Value&#13;
of Earnings or Income in Kind&#13;
The household expenditure data were to be collected through daily&#13;
1/&#13;
visits during the reference month.7 The head of the household as well as&#13;
other members aged 14 and above were requested to record their daily&#13;
expenditure.&#13;
Expenditure on consumer durables was recorded (a) for the 12 months&#13;
preceding the month of the HES (on the second day of the survey month) and&#13;
(b) for the 12 months of 1973 along with the Household Income Survey&#13;
(HIS). Households were asked to record their durable goods expenditure&#13;
during 1973; however, these requests were presumably communicated during&#13;
the initial survey and the period of recording of durable goods expenditure&#13;
would probably vary according to the month when the households were inter-&#13;
viewed for the HES. The durable consumer goods expenditure data recorded on&#13;
the available tapes are those collected in the course of the HIS.&#13;
Income&#13;
Persons receiving income on a daily basis were asked about their&#13;
earnings each day or on alternate days of the survey month and the figures were&#13;
added up for the month. Other household members not receiving daily income, as&#13;
well as the household as a whole, were asked about their income during the entire&#13;
month during the last three days of the month. Income accruing to the household&#13;
as a whole was recorded as received by the household head.&#13;
1/ According to Mr. R. Chander, the Chief Statistician of Malaysia at the time&#13;
of the survey, the frequency of visits was reduced to one on alternate&#13;
days, after the field work had continued for two or three months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-81-&#13;
For businesses which did not know their net income during the&#13;
survey month, average monthly profit or net income during the year preceding&#13;
the survey month was recorded.&#13;
Unincorporated enterprises in agricultural activities were also&#13;
asked to report their net income during the reference month. (If, however,&#13;
a padi farmer did not receive any income from his farm during the reference&#13;
month, presumably he would have been asked to report the average net income&#13;
during the year preceding the survey month and it would have been divided&#13;
by 12 to arrive at the monthly average.)&#13;
Elaborate instructions were provided to impute the value of&#13;
(a) free food received from employers, Cb) owner-occupied, subsidized or&#13;
free housing, (c) subsidizedsupply of consumer goods, (d) wages and salaries&#13;
in kind and (e) consumption of goods from owned shop or home produce.&#13;
Table 1 below summarizes the recommended procedures.&#13;
Income accruing to the household as a whole was recorded against&#13;
the household head.&#13;
The importance of the imputation procedure can be seen partly&#13;
in Table 2, which indicates the number of persons reporting various sources&#13;
of income (or receipts) and the quantum of income (or receipts).-   Out of a&#13;
2/&#13;
total 7,927 persons reporting some wage or salary income-, only 22.2 percent&#13;
had received some compensation in kind, and for about 83.5 percent of them,&#13;
such income in kind had to be imputed some value. In aggregate terms, income&#13;
in kind formed less than five percent of the total amount earned as compensation&#13;
of employees.&#13;
] Note that the same person could report several sources of income.&#13;
2 About 85 percent of the persons reporting income from wages or salary&#13;
were employees in terms of their principal employment status during&#13;
the reference week for the collection of labour force particulars.&#13;

The imputation procedures are much more important for persons&#13;
reporting income from unincorporated enterprises; for over 86 percent of&#13;
them some income was imputed. A large majority of the imputations were&#13;
made for income from agricultural activities (i.e., land cultivation,&#13;
forestry and logging, fishing, dairy and poultry farming) and for the&#13;
imputed rent of owner-occupied housing.&#13;
HES Data on Income and Expenditure&#13;
The annual per capita income (PCY) during 1973, estimated from_the&#13;
HES, was M$811.6, almost 33 percent short of the per capita GDP (at factor&#13;
cost) estimate of M$1,211.0.-/ Of course, the survey estimates refer to personal&#13;
income and are not really comparable with the GDP figures. Unfortunately, the&#13;
personal income estimates were not available at the moment of writing.&#13;
The annual per capita expenditure (PCE), estimated from the HES,&#13;
was M$685.8, only 15.3 percent lower than the estimate of M$809.9 reported&#13;
by the Inter-Agency Planning Group.-/ It is not possible to ascertain the pro-&#13;
cedures followed by the Planning Group to arrive at their estimate (particularly&#13;
whether or to what extent they had relied on the HES data for their estimates).&#13;
Savings Rates ImpZicit in the HES Data&#13;
There is no reason for a household to balance its income and expenditure&#13;
over a short period of a month, for which the HES data were collected. Further,&#13;
our HES data on expenditure do not really pertain to the particular month, because&#13;
1/ The population of Peninsular Malaysia in mid-1973 is estimated at 9,874 thousands&#13;
(including an adjustment for the estimated net undercount of 4.05 percent in the&#13;
1970 Census of population). The GDP estimate, prepared by the Economic&#13;
Planning Unit, is taken from the World Bank Report No. 1177a-MA, MaZaysia:&#13;
Second Plan.Performance and Third Plan Issues, Vol. 1 (1976). Table 2.5&#13;

the "durable goods expenditure" reported on our takes is the average monthly&#13;
figure obtained from the HIS question about such expenditure during the&#13;
calendar year 1973. However, the error resulting from this substitution of&#13;
HIS data for the HES data is unlikely to be significant because only 1.8&#13;
percent of the reported total expenditure was on "major durables and&#13;
recreation equipment." Likewise, the savings rates examined below are&#13;
intended to be approximate.&#13;
The sample households considered for estimating the savings rate&#13;
excluded those with zero, negative or unreported income and those with zero&#13;
or unreported expenditure. For the remaining 7,212 households, the estimated&#13;
savings rate was 16.2 percent.-/ No other independent estimate of the savings&#13;
rate is available.&#13;
Table 3 shows savings rates for deciles of per capita income and&#13;
expenditure. The proportion of households reporting dissavings varies in-&#13;
versely with decile in terms of per capita income; but it does not show&#13;
any clear relationship with deciles in terms of per capita expenditure.&#13;
The bottom four deciles in terms of PCY reported negative savings.&#13;
The rate of dissaving declines and that of saving rises as PCY deciles&#13;
increases. When households are ranked according to their PCE, each decile&#13;
reports positive savings but there is no systematic relationship between&#13;
decile and the saving rate.&#13;
Table 4 shows savings rates according to selected characteristics&#13;
of the household head, separately for urban and rural areas. The positive&#13;

households are shown in Table A.29    in the Statistical Appendix.   The&#13;
overall savings rate for the total sample was 15.5 percent.&#13;

relationship between educational attainment and savings rates is quite&#13;
plausible. The differences in savings rates according to class of worker&#13;
raise the question whether and to what extent the self-employed really save&#13;
less because of their low income or whether their income is understated.&#13;
Differences in savings rates by month of interview, once again, remind us&#13;
that expenditure tends to peak during months including festivals; the customary&#13;
timing of bonus payments etc. can lead to sizeable fluctuations in the income&#13;
stream as well.&#13;
On the whole, however, the savings rate estimated in Tables 3 and 4&#13;
are quite impressive and also plausible. They suggest that given the&#13;
limitations of any attempt to ascertain income and expenditure through the&#13;
survey method, the HES was quite successful in attaining its objectives.&#13;
This impression is reinforced by the broad comparability of the survey data&#13;
with similar information gathered in the 1970 Census.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
A COMPARISON OF THE HES DATA WITH THE 1970 CENSUS&#13;
Tables 1, 2 and 3 provide the basic information needed to compare the&#13;
HES data with those of the 1970 census.-L/ The data pertain to the demo-&#13;
graphic characteristics, educational attainment, participation rates, the&#13;
incidence of unemployment and some key characteristics of the employed.&#13;
Demogracphic Characteristics&#13;
The average size of a household according to the HES was about&#13;
the same as reported by the 1970 Census for "private" or non-institutional&#13;
households. However, instead of a one percent excess of males indicated by&#13;
the 1970 Census, the HES observed a deficit of males (or an excess of&#13;
females) of the order of 3.2 percent. This difference with respect to the&#13;
sex composition of the population is not altogether unrelated to the ob-&#13;
servation in Table 2 that households surveyed by the HES included a&#13;
slightly lower percentage of single-member households (in fact, of house-&#13;
holds with up to three mexwbers) than the 1970 Census.&#13;
The age-dependency ratio (persons aged 0-14 and 65 and over per&#13;
1000 persons aged 15-64) estimated by    the HES was a little lower than&#13;
that reported by the census; but the difference does not appear to be&#13;
significant, particularly if some allowance is made for the well-known errors&#13;
of age reporting. The broad age distribution of the population according to&#13;
the two sources is very similar, as are the median ages of each sex.&#13;
I/  The reference date of the 1970 Census was August 25.   The population data&#13;
were collected during the two weeks beginning August 25.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-96-&#13;
Educational Attainment&#13;
The HES did not collect data on literacy as such, but instead recorded&#13;
the highest certificate obtained at school, college or university. It&#13;
permits identification of persons who had no formal education (i.e. any&#13;
schooling), including religious education, and those who had attended school&#13;
-but did not receive any certificate. It has not been possible to compile&#13;
a detailed comparable tabulation from the 1970 Census but three major&#13;
categories are shown in Table 1. The proportion of persons aged 15 years&#13;
or more, who had not attended any school, was considerably lower in the&#13;
survey than in the census. While this proportion should indeed decline&#13;
through attrition of the elderly with low levels of literacy and educa-&#13;
tion, the cbserved difference is rather large for a three year interval.&#13;
It seems possible that households with a high proportion of persons with-&#13;
out any schooling whatsoever were left out from the survey for various&#13;
reasons (including the possibility that they might find it difficult to&#13;
keep any records on expenditure or provide reasonably reliable information), Of&#13;
course, any such exclusion was not deliberate and a firm inference is not possible.&#13;
Participation Rates&#13;
Turning now to the labour force and work-related characteristics&#13;
in Table 3, the reference period for the collection of data on these items&#13;
was one week in both the 1970 Census and the HIES. As noted in Annex 1,&#13;
the labour force particulars for the HES households were collected for&#13;
a fixed reference week which included the fifteenth day of each month.&#13;
However, since the HES was spread over a full year, with one-twelfth of the&#13;

-100-&#13;
sample surveyed in each calendar month of 1973, the seasonal variations&#13;
would be averaged out.-&#13;
Interestingly, the HES participation rates are significantly&#13;
higher than those reported by the 1970 Census, particularly for females.&#13;
It is possible that the frequent visits of investigators to the sample&#13;
households during the survey month enabled them to make good acquaintance&#13;
with the respondents and provided a more comprehensive estimate of the&#13;
level of labour force participation. A small part of the difference is&#13;
explained by the inclusion of "inactive unemployed" persons in the 1973 survey&#13;
estimate of the labour force, a topic to which we now turn.&#13;
The Incidence oj UnenrpZoyment&#13;
-    In the HES, unemployment was measured by identifying whether&#13;
persons who had n6t worked for "at least one day" during the reference week&#13;
were either looking for a job or work or would accept a job or work, al-&#13;
though they were not looking for it. (The two categories are sometimes&#13;
2/&#13;
termed the active unemployed and the inactive unemployed.) In the 1970&#13;
Census, persons who had not done any form of work for pay or profit during&#13;
the reference period of one week and had reported having "looked for work"&#13;
were classified as "unemployed". In effect, therefore, the 1970 census&#13;
1/ The biannual labour force survey had indicated a labour force par-&#13;
ticipation rate of 61.1 percent during April 1973 and 64.0 percent&#13;
during September 1973 (urban rates: 56.8 and 59.0 percent; rural&#13;
rates: 63.5 and 66.5 percent, respectively). Like the HES, the&#13;
labour force survey restricted the collection of data to ages 15-64&#13;
although according to the 1970 census, 8.4 percent of persons aged&#13;
10-14 and 30.0 percent of those aged 65 and over were in the labour&#13;
force.&#13;
2/ Some persons who had not worked during the reference week, but had some&#13;
"employment, work on farm, enterprise or other family enterprise to return&#13;
to" were not considered unemployed in the HES. They formed 2.4, 1.0 and 2.1&#13;
percent of all males, females and persons, respectively, in the age group&#13;
15-64.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-&#13;
count of unemployed persons did not include the "inactive" unemployed. The&#13;
inactive unemployed constituted about 17, 30 and 23 percent of all unemployed&#13;
males, females and persons, respectively in the HES. If they were excluded&#13;
from the labour force, the HES estimates of participation rates for males,&#13;
females and all persons together would decline by 0.8, 1.9 and 1.2 per-&#13;
centage points, respectively.&#13;
If we overlook the difference between the 1970 Census and the&#13;
FEES with respect to the procedure of recording the unemployed, the esti-&#13;
mates of unemployment according to the two sources appear very similar.-/&#13;
However, using a comparable definition, the incidence of "active" unemployment&#13;
appears to have declined since the 1970 Census from 5.3 to 4.0 percent.&#13;
Given the fact that clhe census was conducted in August 1970 and its data&#13;
refer to the week preceding the census date, its estimates might reflect&#13;
a-seasonal peak in unemployment. However, the labour force surveys during&#13;
1971-73 have also shown a decline in "active" unemployment from 7.8 per-&#13;
cent in October 1971 to 4.3 percent during September-October 1973 (the&#13;
other estimates being 7.4 and 6.0 percent during April-May and September,&#13;
1972, respectively, and 5.6 percent during April-May 1973).-/    Therefore,&#13;
1/ The unemployment rate for females was about 10 percent lower in the&#13;
HES than in the census despite the more com=rehensive definition of&#13;
the former. However, the higher proportion of females in the popu-&#13;
lation, the higher proportion of females in ages 15-64 and the higher&#13;
female participation rate in the HES, all relative to the 1970 Census,&#13;
together contribute to the virtually identical estimates of the&#13;
incidence of unemployment for the two sexes together.&#13;
2/ In the 1974 labour force survey, the concept of unemployment was changed&#13;
to include the "inactive" unemployed. During April-May 1974, the&#13;
active unemployed formed 4.4 percent of the labour force but an addi-&#13;
tional 2.9 percent were classified as "inactive" unemployed. See:&#13;
Malaysia, Department of Statics, Report of the Labour Force Survey,&#13;
April/May 1974, (Kuala Lumpur, 1977), pp. 50-51, Tables. The inactively&#13;
unemployed included those who did not seek work because (a) of bad&#13;
weather or temporary sickness; (b) results of search in the preceding&#13;
weeks were awaited; (c) the search was given up out of belief that&#13;
no work was available; and (d) a job was found, which would start&#13;
soon. Ibid, p.143.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-&#13;
although the averaging of the situations during different months of the&#13;
year might partly explain the lower HES estimate of active unemployment,&#13;
the difference between the census and the HES estimates also seems to be&#13;
part of a general trend.&#13;
Characterzstics of the Ezm7Zoyed&#13;
Since the employed formed almost 95 percent of the labour force&#13;
according to both the census and the HES, a comparison of the character-&#13;
istics of the employed is of considerable interest. The three character-&#13;
istics compared in Table 3 refer to the "principal" status during the&#13;
reference week for those who had reported more than one activity.-/&#13;
The differences between the HES and the 1970 Census with respect&#13;
to the class of worker, industry and occupation of the employed are quite&#13;
sizeable, both for male and female workers. The proportion of the employees&#13;
is significantly higher and that of family helpers, in particular, sig-&#13;
nificantly lower in the HES than in the 1970 Census, despite the fact that&#13;
the former reported higher participation rates and almost the same inci-&#13;
dence of unemployment. The differences in the proportion of workers&#13;
engaged in agriculture, manufacturing , trade and commerce are related&#13;
to the class of worker differences. Likewise, the proportion of white&#13;
collar workers, and miscellaneous craftsmen, and production workers is&#13;
higher in the HES than in the census.&#13;
1/  The census data on the characteristics of the employed include&#13;
those who were unemployed during the reference week but had worked&#13;
before. In other words, the distributions refer to the "experienced&#13;
labour force." However, the unemployed who liad worked before formed&#13;
only 16.9 percent of all unemployed and one percent of the total&#13;
experienced labour force. Therefore, the reported distributions are&#13;
almost the same as if they related to only the employed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I ln3-&#13;
To some extent, the observed differences are a part of the&#13;
secular changes in the employment structure of the Malaysian economy,&#13;
but the changes appear rather large for a three-year interval. Some&#13;
of the differences in the industrial and occupational distribution are&#13;
explained by the census classification of over five percent of the workers&#13;
in the miscellaneous category of "other". The seasonal variations in the&#13;
industrial and occupational distributions might also contribute to&#13;
the observed differences; but an identification of the likely magnitude&#13;
of the seasonal variations requires a detailed scrutiny of the results&#13;
of different labour force surveys, which is not possible at the present&#13;
time. However, such a scrutiny should be an important necessary part&#13;
of any effort to compare the results of the HES and the HIS with the&#13;
income data collected in the Post Enumeration Survey conducted after&#13;
the 1970 Census.&#13;
In conclusion, the demographic characteristics of the population&#13;
according to the HES are quite similar to those reported by the 1970 Census.&#13;
The HES households had about three percent deficit of males, or excess of&#13;
females, contrary to the one percent excess of males reported by the cen-&#13;
sus. Rouseholds with up to three members were slightly underrepresented&#13;
in the HES. The proportion of persons with no education was significantly&#13;
lower in the HES than in the census, as were the proportions of non-employees&#13;
and the agricultural workers among the employed.    Prima facie, the&#13;
observed differences seem somewhat larger than would be expected even&#13;
in a dynamic economy over an interval of three years; but further compar-&#13;
ative analysis is necessary to estimate the possible impact of seasonal&#13;

variations in the employment structure, before determining whether and to&#13;
what extent the HES sample included an overrepresentation of households and&#13;
individuals with specific characteristics.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNEMPLOYED&#13;
The incidence of unemployment reported by the 1973 lHousehold&#13;
Expenditure Survey' for persons aged 15-64 has already been discussed in&#13;
Section II (pp. 23-24). The emDhasis there was on the differentials according&#13;
to the per capita expenditure of the household. This Annex reviews the various&#13;
characteristics of the unemployed according to urban-rural residence and sex.&#13;
The Inactive Unemployed&#13;
The total number of unemployed persons in the sample was 675 (when&#13;
the tabulation was for ages 15-64) and 679 (when only the labour force "summary&#13;
codes" were considered).-/ The unemployed include not only (i) persons actively&#13;
seeking work during the reference week but also (ii) those who would accept work&#13;
if it were offered. The latter are called "inactive unemployed" and Table 1&#13;
shiows their number and their proportion among all unemployed.  As would be&#13;
expected, the inactive unemployed are more numerous in rural areas than in&#13;
urban areas and among females than among males.&#13;
Age Composition&#13;
Table 2 summarizes the distribution of the unemployed according to&#13;
age, educational attainment, principal activity during the reference week and&#13;
relationship to the head of the household.&#13;
As has been observed in several other developing countries, almost&#13;
three-fourths of the unemployed were aged 15-24, the ages when people normally&#13;
1/  The difference being small, no special effort has been made to identify the&#13;
characteristics of the four persons not in the age group 15-64.&#13;

unemployed.&#13;
enter the labour force. The incidence of unemployment in these ages tends to&#13;
be quite high and the relevant participation and unemployment rates are shown&#13;
in Table 3.&#13;
We had estimated the measures of association between average per capita&#13;
expenditure (PCE) and the labour force participation rates as well as the inci-&#13;
dence of unemployment for the two age groups, on the basis of the values for&#13;
different deciles. There is a statistically significant negative association&#13;
between the participation rates and PCE for males (and all persons) aged 15-19&#13;
but not for females and not for the age group 20-24. The expected negative&#13;
association between the incidence of unemployment and PCE is statistically&#13;
significant at the five percent level for all persons aged 15-19 and 20-24&#13;

and for females aged 20-24. For males, the negative correlation coefficients&#13;
for the incidence of unemployment are significant only at the 10 percent level&#13;
(although when one looks at Table 3, the decile differentials in the incidence&#13;
of unemployment of males aged 20-24 seem to be somewhat systematic and sizeable&#13;
between the bottom and top quintiles).&#13;
Educational Attainmient&#13;
The distribution of the unemployed by educational attainment in Table 2&#13;
shows that only a small percentage of them were without any formal schooling&#13;
whatsoever. Since--we -have not obtained the educational distribution of the&#13;
labour force, it is difficult to estimate the incidence of unemployment by&#13;
educational attainment. However, one can compare the distribution of the un-&#13;
employed by education with that of population, ignoring the differentials in&#13;
participation rates by educational attainment.&#13;
Persons with lower and higher certificates of education are clearly&#13;
over-represented among the unemployed, relative to their proportion in the&#13;
population aged 15 and over, particularly in urban areas. The incidence of un-&#13;
employment is likely to be significantly above the average among them. Unemployment&#13;
seems to be below the average level among persons with no formal schooling,&#13;
both in urban and rural areas. For persons with some primary education, un-&#13;
employment seems below the average level in urban areas, at about the average&#13;
level among rural males and above the average level among rural females.&#13;
Activity During the Reference Week&#13;
A question is often asked about what the unemployed persons do&#13;
with their time. Table 2 shows the principal activity of the unemployed during the&#13;

reference week wlien the labour force particulars were collected. As would be&#13;
expected, a majority of the unemployed women and one-tenth of the unemployed&#13;
men continue with or take up housework and a small percentage of both (between&#13;
five to nine percent) take up studies. A few of the unemployed men relied on&#13;
their pension incomes but a large majority of them presumably continued search&#13;
for work.&#13;
Relationship to Heads of Households&#13;
An examination of the relationship of the unemployed to household&#13;
heads shows almost two-thirds of them to be sons or daughters. Only about 10&#13;
percent of the unemployed -- about 16 percent of the unemployed males -- were&#13;
heads of households.   Others were relatives of the household heads.   It is&#13;
not surprising that most of the unemployed rely on their relatives for support.&#13;
Perhaps such support is crucial for permitting them to search for work. However,&#13;
as noted earlier, the possibility of support from relatives largely explains&#13;
the absence of any significant relationship between the incidence of unemploy-&#13;
ment and the PCE decile in rural areas as well as among urban males.&#13;

            Following a discussion of the relative
            concept of poverty, the characteristics of households or
            population in different deciles of per capita expenditure
            are examined separately for urban, rural and all areas.
            Major differences are seen in the demographic
            characteristics, the proportion of persons with no
            schooling, the crude labour force participation rates and
            the sectoral distribution of the workers, but not in the
            participation rates of persons aged 15-64, nor in the
            incidence of unemployment. The incidence of absolute poverty
            is above the average both in urban and rural areas if the
            head of the household: (a) has received no formal schooling;
            (b) is self-employed or a family helper; or (c) is an
            agricultural worker. The broad pattern and regional
            variations remain unchanged even with a 30 percent lower
            poverty line. Educational attainment of the household head
            stands out as the most important explanatory variable, with
            ethnic group, child-dependency ratio of the household and
            the class of worker of the head next in importance.
            Education is also the most important determinant of the
            earnings of the employees. Several of the estimates of the
            elasticity of demand for different categories of consumption
            items vary according to the ranking criterion used.
