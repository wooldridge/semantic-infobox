     India is part of the global trend towards&#13;
increasing urbanization. Today nearly 28&#13;
percent of the population live in cities, a figure&#13;
which is expected to increase to 41percent by&#13;
the year 2021. The number of cities with a&#13;
population in excess of one million has&#13;
increased from 23 in 1991 to 35 in 2001.Yet&#13;
the infrastructure and services necessary to&#13;
support these large, and growing, populations&#13;
is lagging far behind the pace of urbanization,&#13;
resulting, among other problems, in the&#13;
proliferation of slums and a chronic shortage&#13;
of safe water and sewerage systems.&#13;
     There is growing evidence that consumers&#13;
arewillingtopaymorethantheprevailingrates&#13;
for improved levels of water supply and&#13;
sanitation, but the charges levied by providers&#13;
do not match this willingness. The result is a&#13;
vicious cycle of low revenues, high costs, and&#13;
poorlevelsofservices.Thecentralgovernment&#13;

            cities with a population in excess of one million has
            increased from 23 in 1991 to 35 in 2001. Yet the
            infrastructure and services necessary to support these
            large, and growing, populations is lagging far behind the
            pace of urbanization, resulting, among other problems, in
            the proliferation of slums and a chronic shortage of safe
            water and sewerage systems. There is growing evidence that
            consumers are willing to pay more than the prevailing rates
            for improved levels of water supply and sanitation, but the
            charges levied by providers do not match this willingness.
            The result is a vicious cycle of low revenues, high costs,
            and poor levels of services. The central government is
            introducing a number of fiscal incentives to support
            much-needed reform and restructuring; these include the
            Urban Reform Incentive Fund (URIF) and the City Challenge
            Fund (CCF).
