THE CAPACITY TO EVALUATE: WHY COUNTRIES NEED IT&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   Evaluation skills are central to effective development work. Evaluation captures real results, leads to feed-&#13;
   back and learning, and identifies areas where more capacity is needed. It is also an essential tool for mak-&#13;
   ing mid-course corrections in ongoing programs, developing appropriate indicators, tracking an individ-&#13;
   ual's or organization's capacity to deliver on its mandate, and guiding the design of future programming.&#13;
   Donors now expect countries to be full partners in the development process, which means that they need&#13;
   to have the capacity to evaluate their own progress and to use the findings to continuously improve their&#13;
   performance. The evidence suggests that these changes can potentially have a transformative effect on&#13;
   governance and make poverty reduction efforts dramatically more effective. The World Bank, in partner-&#13;
   ship with Carleton University in Ottawa, is currently providing evaluation capacity development through&#13;
   its International Program for Development Evaluation Training (IPDET), which has already trained more&#13;
   than 850 practitioners from 100 countries.&#13;

disenchanted with development assistance: donors           tools necessary to manage development. The emphasis&#13;
because of the ineffective use of resources and lack of    of donor lending has, therefore, recently shifted from&#13;
results and governments because the two basic tenets       an ownership to an empowerment/partnership para-&#13;
of the way aid is delivered--the project modality          digm: donors help countries to develop the right tools&#13;
and policy conditionalities--have been ineffective in      to manage development, and partner (not "client")&#13;

evaluate their own development progress is the key to      those evaluations and from stakeholder feedback to&#13;
breaking out of this stalemate.                            continuously improve their performance.&#13;

            The capacity to evaluate : why countries
            need it
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Evaluation skills are central to
            effective development work. Evaluation captures real
            results, leads to feedback and learning, and identifies
            areas where more capacity is needed. It is also an essential
            tool for making mid-course corrections in ongoing programs,
            developing appropriate indicators, tracking an
            individual's or organization's capacity to deliver
            on its mandate, and guiding the design of future
            programming. Donors now expect countries to be full partners
            in the development process, which means that they need to
            have the capacity to evaluate their own progress and to use
            the findings to continuously improve their performance. The
            evidence suggests that these changes can potentially have a
            transformative effect on governance and make poverty
            reduction efforts dramatically more effective. The World
            Bank, in partnership with Carleton University in Ottawa, is
            currently providing evaluation capacity development through
            its International Program for Development Evaluation
            Training (IPDET), which has already trained more than 850
            practitioners from 100 countries.
