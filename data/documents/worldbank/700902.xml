CAPITAL FLOWS AND DEVELOPING COUNTRY DEBT&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
This paper reviews the growth and changing structure of&#13;
the external debt of developing countries, including their&#13;
private, non-guaranteed debt, during the period 1970 through&#13;
1977. It discusses these developments in relation to other&#13;
economic changes during this period as well as the growth&#13;
of external assets. Trends in debt service and the cost of&#13;
debt are reviewed, along with a prospective look kt patterns&#13;
of debt amortization.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The rapid increase in borrowing by developing countries in the&#13;
mid-1970's led to heightened concern over their capacity to service debt.&#13;
In an uncertain international environment, questions still remain&#13;
regarding debt problems, the implications for the debt structure of the rise&#13;
in borrowing from private sources, the maturity profile and costs of debt,&#13;
and the continuing willingness and ability of private banks to supply a&#13;
major portion of the financing needs of developing countries.&#13;
This paper discusses what is known about the evolution of the debt&#13;
of developing countries in the 1970's. It benefits from recent improvements&#13;
in the availability of data, particularly with regard to loans from and debt&#13;
owed by private entities. Specifically, it incorporates data of the private&#13;
sector not guaranteed by public entities in the country of the borrower. These&#13;
data are still estimates in part, but enormous advances have been&#13;
made. More information has also become available on the geographical dis-&#13;
tribution of the claims and liabilities of private banks.&#13;

All data in this paper, unless otherwise noted, are from the World&#13;
Bank's Debtor Reporting System. - A list of the countries covered, and their&#13;
categories appears in Annex Table A.4.&#13;
The evolution of the structure of debt by source, concessionality,&#13;
and debtor group since 1969 is outlined in Part II of this paper. Part III&#13;
assesses the growth of debt from the end of 1969 in relation to other economic&#13;
indicators, including exports, GNP, and the growth of external assets of develop-&#13;
ing countries. Part IV examines the growth of debt service and changes in&#13;
the terms of debt, as well as the maturity structure and future amortization&#13;
patterns resulting from past borrowing. Projections incorporating assumptions&#13;
about new borrowing are to be found in the World Development Report, 1979.&#13;
Part V summarizes and concludes the paper,&#13;
/1 The Debtor Reporting System is based on reports made directly to the World&#13;
Bank by countries on their public and publicly-guaranteed external debt with&#13;
an original maturity of more than one year, and by some countries on their&#13;
private, non-guaranteed debt. Data from this reporting system are published&#13;
in World Bank, World Debt Tables,EC-167/78, October 1978, which has been up-&#13;
dated by periodic supplements. World Debt Tables also includes a full descrip-&#13;
tion of sources and definitions.  In t, these data have been supple-&#13;
mented by unpublished data and estimates of the private, non-guaranteed debt&#13;
of some countries.&#13;

II. THE GROWTH AND STRUCTURE OF EXTERNAL DEBT&#13;
A. BORROWING AND THE GROWTH OF DEBT&#13;
At the end of 1977, the total medium- and long-term debt of&#13;
developing countries was $258.4 billion, of which $206.3 billion, or 80%,&#13;
was owed or guaranteed by developing country governments or government agencies.&#13;
In addition, these countries were conservatively estimated to have had out-&#13;
standing short-term financial obligations of $50-60 billion, although this&#13;
figure is subject to greater uncertainty, in part because short-term liabilities&#13;
are subject to considerable seasonal and other fluctuations. Outstanding IMF&#13;
credit, by convention not reflected in the above figures,was almost $8 billion.&#13;
Thus, the "total" external debt liabilities of these countries were about&#13;
$320 billion.&#13;
In the four years from the end of 1973 through 1977, a period when&#13;
the international economy was adjusting to shocks (the subject of ample dis-&#13;
cussion elsewhere), developing countries' medium- and long-term debt more than&#13;
doubled (in nominal terms), increasing at the equivalent of 21.5% per annum.&#13;
Perhaps because of the attention paid early in that period to the then-loom-&#13;
ing requirements that financial adjustments be made, it is not always recog-&#13;
nized that outstanding debt had also doubled in the preceding four-year period,&#13;
from the end of 1969 through 1973, going from $57.1 billion to $118.4 billion,&#13;
equivalent to an average annual rate of 20.0%. Although there is no single&#13;
appropriate deflator for international financial claims, it may be noted that,&#13;
using the GDP deflator of OECD North countries, expressed in US dollars, the&#13;
rate of growth of outstanding debt in constant dollars was considerably lower&#13;

The growth of debt reflects the continuation of net borrowing&#13;
by developing countries.l Annual net borrowing by these countries iicreased&#13;
particularly rapidly in the first half of the 1970's, rising from $9.3 1l'lion&#13;
to nearly $40 billion in 1977. The growth of annual borrowing subsided in&#13;
1976 and 1977 as needs in those years eased. The rate of growth of borrowing&#13;
in real terms between 1970 and the average 1975-77 level was much lower than&#13;
the 25.7% rate in current prices as shown in Table 2. Deflating by developing&#13;
country import prices provides an approximate measure of the changes in pur-&#13;
chasing power for developing countries of their borrowing. The export price&#13;
/1 Strictly speaking, net borrowing, i.e., disbursements less repayments of&#13;
debt, is not precisely equal to the increment to disbursed outstanding in&#13;
any given year. This discrepancy rises for two reasons. First, disburse-&#13;
ments and repayments are transactions which occur during the year, and by&#13;
statistical convention, transactions that are not denominated in US$ are&#13;
converted to US$ at average exchange rates prevailing during the year for&#13;
the currencies concerned. However, the non-US$ portion of debt outstanding&#13;
at the end of the year (about 40% at the end of 1977) is converted to US$&#13;
at end of year exchange rates. This gives rise to the familiar valuation&#13;
problem, which has become more visible in recent years with the widespread&#13;
adoption of floating exchange rates. As a result, net borrowing may be&#13;
higher or lower than the change in debt outstanding, depending on the&#13;
relationship between average and end of year exchange rates, and the&#13;
currency composition of debt. Second, any outstanding debt which is can-&#13;
celled during a year will not be reflected in net borrowing, but will&#13;
affect the end of year total of outstanding debt, and hence the year&#13;
to year change in outstanding debt. These factors may be important in the&#13;
analysis of individual countries in a single year, but do not significantly&#13;
affect the interpretation of trends for groups of countries over a num-&#13;
ber of years.&#13;

index provides a measure of the real rate of growth of exports required&#13;
to maintain a balance between borrowing and exports. The US dollar GDP&#13;
deflator may be seen as a broad measure of the change in the real value&#13;
of flows from the point of view of the lenders.&#13;

Although there has been a rise of net borrowing, it is useful to bear&#13;
in mind that imports by developing countries, which rose from $96 billion in&#13;
1970 to an average of $329 billion in 1975-77, are still largely "financed"&#13;
by ey-ort earnings. The net proceeds from borrowing by developing countries&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
were on the average equivalent to 11.1% of their imports in 1975-77, compared&#13;
to  9.6% in 1970.&#13;
The structures of import financing are distinct in the low and middle&#13;
income countries. In the former, exports have been relatively lower in relation&#13;
to imports. Official transfers, consisting almost entirely of development&#13;
assistance grants, equalled just over 5% of imports compared with less than 2%&#13;
in middle income countries, in 1975-77. Concessional loans financed 10.8% of&#13;
the imports of low-income countries compared with 1.4% for middle income coun-&#13;
tries, but these flows have not kept up with imports (see Table 3).&#13;

Private flows have been a relatively much more important source of finance&#13;
for middle income countries, rising to almost 8% of imports. The increase&#13;
in loans from private sources in the 1970's reflects in part the substitution&#13;
of loans for equity investments, as the benefits of the latter to the host&#13;
/1&#13;
countries have come under increasing question.    Direct investment has been&#13;
decreasing in relation to imports in both low and middle income countries.&#13;
B. THE CHANGING STRUCTURE OF DEBT&#13;
Debt Owed to Private Creditors&#13;
Debt to private creditors has increased much more rapidly than&#13;
debt to official agencies. Whereas, at the end of 1973, debt held by private&#13;
creditors was only 8% higher than officially-held debt, during 1974-77, pri-&#13;
vate entities lent $2 for every $1 of official lending. Private creditors&#13;
held 60% of the outstanding debt at the end of 1977, compared to 45%&#13;
in 1969, and accounted for 64% of the increase in debt between the end&#13;
of 1969 and 1977. It should be noted that the rate of growth of debt of&#13;
private lenders in 1973-77, though high (26%), was about the same as&#13;
in 1969-73.&#13;
Among priva.te creditors, there has been a shift toward lending through&#13;
financial markets and away from lending by suppliers.  indeed, debt to supplIers&#13;
increased more slowly than debt to official agencies: as a proportion of public&#13;
debt owed to private creditors, it fell from 53% at the end of 1969 to 19% in&#13;
1977. Suppliers' credits had emerged as an important source of finance in the&#13;
1960's, as suppliers and their governments took measures to assist their own&#13;

export businesses. Although borrowers were increasingly able to handle&#13;
debt on commercial terms, some excesses in this area did lead to debt dif-&#13;
ficulties.&#13;
Banks became more active as lenders to developing countries In the&#13;
early 1970's. Borrowers increasingly substituted loans from them for suppliers'&#13;
credits. These loans were not only competitive in price, but offered ad-&#13;
vantages of ease of arrangement, flexibility of use, and quick disbursement, and&#13;
were not necessarily tied to specific purchases. For bank loans that were&#13;
related to specific imports - "buyers'credits" - official support in the major&#13;
exporting countries that took the form of guarantees or insurance was available;&#13;
this support was also available for supplierstcredits. However, buyerst credits&#13;
have become the more prevalent form of officially supported export credit.&#13;
Public and publicly-guaranteed debt owed to banks (and other private&#13;
financial institutions) increased at an average rate of over 40% in 1969-1973&#13;
and at 40% per annum during the end of 1973-77 period and was the fastest&#13;
growing creditor component of debt of developing countries (see Table 4). As a pro-&#13;
portion of total public debt4-`, it rose from 10% to 36%, as a proportion of that&#13;
portion of public debt owed to private creditors, from 32% to 73%. Private&#13;
firms with international credit needs, in the few developing countries with&#13;
sizeable private sectors of this type, have always relied on private sources of&#13;
funds. This private, non-guaranteed debt, the bulk of which is believed to be&#13;

owed to private banks, has grown more slowly than public and publicly-&#13;
guaranteed debt owed to private creditors. To the extent that private,&#13;
non-guaranteed debt is owed by firms with multinational links, the&#13;
difference between this debt and direct investment is in many cases&#13;
indistinct.&#13;

The increased availability of loans from private banks was facili-&#13;
tated by institutional developments in the international financial markets&#13;
in the early 1970's. These developments permitted a growing pool of short-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
term funds (mostly offshore) to be transformed into long-term loans&#13;
without the previous risks. The syndicated floating rate bank credit&#13;
transferred the risk of interest rate fluctuations from lenders to&#13;
borrowers.  Through the practice of syndication, a wholesale market could&#13;
be developed, lowering costs, while large sums could be raised at the&#13;
same time that the exposure of any one lender arising from a single trans-&#13;
action could be reduced. The growth of an international interbank deposit&#13;
and money market facilitated the funding of loans, particularly for banks&#13;
lending in other than their home currencies.&#13;
These various developments, which initially gave banks a compe-&#13;
titive edge over other lenders, had the effect of preparing both borrowers&#13;
and the financial markets for the much larger demands for international&#13;
financing in the mid-1970's. These demands have come not only from&#13;
developing countries. Despite the very rapid growth of borrowing by&#13;
developing countries, their share in total loans on these markets, though&#13;
large, has fallen off somewhat from 1976 to 1978 after rising sharply from&#13;
1973 to 1975, at least as measured by publicized loan commitments (see&#13;
Table 5).&#13;

ihe 1970's have also seen a rapid growth of the international&#13;
or Eurobond market, which together with the growth of foreign issues&#13;
in national bond markets, have provided an increasing source of funds&#13;
for a limited number of developing countries.  Total issues in these&#13;
markets, including both public issues and privately-placed bonds, in-&#13;
creased sixfold between 1970 and 1977. While developing countries have&#13;
accounted for a fluctuating share of this total, it has risen notably&#13;
since 1975. In 1977, bond issues by developing countries constituted&#13;
about 11% of total net borrowing by these countries; outstanding debt&#13;
to bondholders was about 4% of total debt. About 75% of the total&#13;
issues by developing country in 1977 were by borrowers in Mexico, Brazil,&#13;
Venezuela, Spain, and Israel. (See Table 60)&#13;

Official Creditors&#13;
At the end of 1977, 402 of the debt of developing countries was&#13;
owed to official creditors. This category of debt grew at an annual rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
of 16% throughout the period from the end of 1969 through 1977, compared&#13;
with 21  for total debt.  About 68% of officially-held debt at the end&#13;
of 1977 was on concessional terms.  The rate of growth of concessicna3&#13;
debt was only slightly below that of total official debt in 1969 to 1977.&#13;
but as a proportion of total debt fell from 40% at the end of 1969 to&#13;
28% at the end of 1977.&#13;
The rate of growth of concessional debt owed to governments&#13;
slowed in 1973-77, despite a sharp rise in concessional lending from&#13;
OPEC-member countries. There was a notable decline in the growth of&#13;
debt on concessional terms owed to countries which are members of the&#13;
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD during 1973 to 1977.&#13;
This reflects a slowdown in the growth of development assistance flows,&#13;
as well as a relative shift toward grant aid and contributions to multi-&#13;
lateral institutions, and away from direct lending, by DAC countries&#13;
during this period. ConceAsional debt owed to multilateral institutions&#13;
has been growing more rapidly, accelerating to an annual rate of nearly&#13;
27% in 1973 to 1977. (See Table 7.)&#13;

The growth of debt at sarket terns owed to official entities&#13;
has accelerated, especially for that portion owed to aultilateral&#13;
institutions. However, the growth of this category of debt WsB still no&#13;
higher than the rate of growth of total outstanding debt.  Bilateral&#13;
debt at market terms, almost entirely official export credits, has been&#13;
growing more slowly. However, it should be noted that these figures&#13;
include only direct lending by export credit agencies. The support given&#13;
by these agencies in the form of guarantees and insurance of private&#13;
lending, which has been growing very rapidly in recent years, is reflected&#13;
in part in the growth of debt of these lenders.&#13;
Creditor/Debtor Patterns of Debt         -&#13;
There is complementarity in the patterns of lending by official&#13;
and private institutions, and in the sources of finance used by different&#13;
groups of countries. As shown in Part A of Table 8, 94% of debt owed to&#13;
private creditors was by borrowers in middle income countries, while only&#13;
6% was owed by low income countries. By contrast, 49% of debt on&#13;
concessioial --ers owed to ufficial institutions was owed by low income&#13;
countries. Similarly, countries in the upper middle income group, which&#13;
account for 50% of the total debt of developing countries, and 68% of debt&#13;
owed to private creditors, accounted for only 18% of concessional debt.&#13;
In Part B of Table 8, the varying importance of different sources&#13;
of finance for each group of countries is shown. For example, at the&#13;
end of 1977,71% of the debt of low income countries was on concessional&#13;
terms, but only 10 of- the debt of upper middle income countries. Private&#13;

Note:  The country composition of income groups is shown in Annex Table A.4.&#13;

sources account for 21% of the debt of low income countries, 52% for lower&#13;
and intermediate middle income countries, and 79% for upper middle income&#13;
countries. There was less variation in the proportion of debt at market&#13;
terms owed to official institutions, which ranged from a low of 8% for&#13;
low income countries, to 18% for lower and intermediate middle income&#13;
countries.&#13;
These patterns have shifted during the 1970s. The proportion of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
debt of low income countries on concessional terms has declined slightly&#13;
overall, while private sourced debt has increased; but this is almost entirely&#13;
due to borrowing from private sources since 1973 by Indonesia and Zaire,&#13;
which are included in the low income group. If these countries are excluded,&#13;
the proportion of concessional in total debt of low income countries has&#13;
risen steadily from 80% at the end of 1973 to 86% at the end of 1977.&#13;
Middle income countries have received an increasing share of official, non-&#13;
concessional loans, accounting for 88% of this category of debt at end 1977&#13;
compared to 77% at the end of 1969. Despite this shift, official, non-&#13;
concessional debt has declined as a share of the total for middle income&#13;
countries, as private sourced debt has risen much faster, increasing from&#13;
56% of the middle income total at the end of 1969 to 69% at the end of 1977.&#13;
These trends are shown in Annex Table A.2.&#13;
III. INDICATORS OF INDEBTEDNESS&#13;
As an aid in assessing the growth of debt, and to distinguish it from&#13;
the growth of indebtedness, debt can be measured against other economic&#13;
magnitudes, or "scaled." A great deal of effort has gone into the search for&#13;
one or more indicators which singly or in combination have predictive value&#13;
for debt service capacity and performance. Success has been very limited&#13;
particularly for individual countries where the assessment of the risks&#13;
attached to additional debt is one of the central tasks of any lender, or&#13;
borrower for that matter. Here, rather than looking at individual countries&#13;
the growth of debt is reviewed on the basis of groups of countries in relation&#13;
to their growth of income, of exports or GNP, and to the growth of their&#13;
reserves and other external assets. Such a review gives an indication of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
broad patterns of development and may throw some light on the relations&#13;
between these groups of countries with lenders.&#13;
A. INCOME INDICATORS&#13;
Per capita debt and per capita income are strongly associated&#13;
(see Table 9). The relationship is particularly notable with respect to&#13;
debt owed to private creditors. Concessional debt is more evenly distributed&#13;
on a per capita basis; it is highest in lower and intermediate middle income&#13;
countries, and about equal in low income and upper middle income countries,&#13;
taken as groups.&#13;

These relationships are not surprising, as higher levels of per&#13;
capita income would be expected to be able to support higher levels of per capita&#13;
debt. A more commonly used indicator is to assess the growth of debt in relation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
i the growth of total national income, as measured by GNP, and to&#13;
exports.&#13;
Low Ititome Couutties&#13;
The growth of debt of the low income countries during 1970-77&#13;
averaged 15.8% per year. It was more than matched by annual export growth,&#13;
which averaged over 20% per year in current prices. Consequently, the&#13;
aggregate ratio of debt to exports for these countries declined from 214% in&#13;
1970 to 171% in 1977, as shown in Table 10. Debt rose in relation to GNP,&#13;
however.&#13;
There are great differences among low income countries both in the&#13;
level of the debt ratios and in their changes over time. For example, several&#13;
of the countries, contrary to the general trend, showed increases in debt/export&#13;
ratios, largely because of stagnating exports, and some experienced debt&#13;
difficulties--Somalia, Sierra Leone, and Zaire most notably. (See Annex-Table A.4.)&#13;
For low income countries as a whole, the ratios of outstanding debt&#13;
to GNP and to exports are higher than for middle income countries. However,&#13;
as most of the debt of low income countries is on concessional terms, its&#13;
discounted present value is considerably lower than its nominal amount. Where&#13;
this adjustment is made, low income countries' debt/GNP is lower than that of&#13;
middle income countries, although debt is still higher in relation to exports.&#13;
This reflects the relatively greater contribution of exports to GNP of&#13;
middle income countries as compared to low income countries.&#13;

Middle Income Countries&#13;
The debt of middle income countries increased during 1970-77 at an&#13;
annual rate of 22.4%, slightly faster than exports. While the overall debt/&#13;
export ratio therefore showed only a small increase, debt rose in relation to GNP&#13;
from 15%,.in 1970 to 20% in 1977. These overall figures, moreover, hide some&#13;
significant intra-group differences.  While the annual growth of exports in&#13;
Southern European countries was 19.5% in value, in other middle income countries&#13;
it was 22.8%. Thus, while the debt/export ratio for Southern Europe rose from&#13;
64% in 1970 to 83% in 1977, for other middle income countries it fell from&#13;
71% to 68%. Among these countries, those showing the most rapid increases were&#13;
Peru, Zambia, Morocco, Philippines and Mexico. The growth of debt, coinciding&#13;
with adverse balance of payments developments, has created difficulties for&#13;
Peru and Zambia, but it is probably a sign of rapid growth for the Philippines&#13;
and Mexico.&#13;
Oil-Exporting Countries&#13;
In view of the steep post-1973 rise of export earnings of the&#13;
developing countries which have been major exporters of oil, 1/ it is useful&#13;
to examine the trends in debt ratios for this group of countries separately&#13;
during this period. There was a marked decline in the debt/export ratios&#13;
for these countries, and, to a lesser extent in their ratios of debt/GNP.&#13;
Since 1975,,.however, these ratios have been rising. For Gabon, Algeria, and&#13;
Venezuela, by 1977 they were well above the levels at the beginning of the&#13;
decade. The effect on the aggregate debt ratios for other developing&#13;
countries of excluding these countries is shown in Table 11.&#13;
1/   For the purposes of this paper, these are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia&#13;
(the only low income oil exporter), Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Trinidad and&#13;
Tobago, and Venezuela.&#13;

B. DEBT IN RELATION TO RESERVES AND OTHER EXTERNAL ASSETS&#13;
During 1974-75, years of peak current account deficits for non-oil&#13;
exporting developing countries, these countries did not make additions to&#13;
international reserves. Increased borrowing was required to finance these&#13;
deficits; the ratio of reserves to outstanding debt fell from 52% at end-1973&#13;
to 27% at the end of 1975. However, during 1976-77, except in Southern&#13;
Europe, the current account deficits of these countries narrowed. Because&#13;
borrowing was still maintained, reserves were able to increase from&#13;
$41 billion at the end of 1975 to $64 billion at the end of 1977.&#13;
Southern European developing countries did not adjust as quickly, and while&#13;
reserves rose, they were still well below the level of 1-973. The ratio of&#13;
reserves to debt of these countries continued to decline.&#13;
Oil exporting countries, of course, experienced large increases in&#13;
their reserves, which rose from $8 billion in 1973 to $29 billion in&#13;
1975 to $38 billion in 1977. Nevertheless, by 1975-77 oil exporting&#13;
countries reappeared as borrowers, particularly in international capital markets,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ar-d the ratios of reserves to debt began tc fall; still, they were more than&#13;
three times higher than the average of other developing countries.&#13;

A large portion of official reserve assets are deposited with&#13;
commercial banks in which, of course, non-reserve and private deposits are&#13;
also placed.   Data on the geographical distribution of the assets and&#13;
liabilities of commercial banks in industrialized countries have become&#13;
available in recent years as a result of improved coverage and detail of&#13;
statistics published by the Bank for International Settlements. These&#13;
data permit the construction of a time series of the changes in these banks'&#13;
positions vis a vis developing countries during the years 1976 through 1978.&#13;
As shown in Table 13, which includes short-term positions, the&#13;
outstanding claims of these banks on residents of developing countries were&#13;
Just under $218 billion at the end of 1978. At the same time, these banks&#13;
had liabilities to residents of developing countries of almost $187 billion,&#13;

or equivalent to 85% of their outstanding claims. The resulting net&#13;
debtor position of developing countries (i.e. banks' claims less their&#13;
liabilities) of just under $31 billion, however, comprises a net creditor&#13;
position of oil exporting countries (defined here to include capital&#13;
surplus oil exporting countries) of almost $27 billion, and a net debtor&#13;
position of other developing countries of $57 billion. Liabilities of&#13;
banks to developing countries other than oil exporters were equivalent to&#13;
64% of their claims on them.&#13;
There were important year to year changes during this period. Claims&#13;
on oil-exporting countries expanded rapidly, while, in 1978, new deposits fell&#13;
sharply, to less than $6 billion from $13 billion in 1977. Oil exporting countries&#13;
were thus net borrowers from banks in 1978. Banks' claims on other developing&#13;
countries also expanded sharply in 1978, but, in contrast to oil exporting countries,&#13;
so did banks' liabilities to them, by $24 billion compared to $15 billion in&#13;
1977. On a net basis, banks' claims increased far more slowly in 1977 and&#13;
1978 than in 1976, but the experiences of Southern European and other non-oil&#13;
exporting countrteswere distinct.&#13;
The rapid growth of both assets and liabilities of countries vis a vis&#13;
banks in some cases reflects policies of borrowing and redepositing loan proceeds.&#13;
Such policies are believed to enhance continued access to finance from international&#13;
capital markets, as well as provide a cushion to absorb economic shocks. By using&#13;
floating rate loans, the cost of using this tactic is roughly equivalent to the&#13;
spread over deposit rates by reference to which these loans are priced; these&#13;
spreads, depending on the borrower and market conditions, have ranged roughly&#13;
from well under 1% per annum of the amount involved to as high as 2%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

In analyzing external financial developments, it has thus&#13;
become particularly Important in recent years to look at both sides of a&#13;
country's "balance sheet".  At the same time, it should be noted that, while&#13;
it may be useful to net the assets of a country against its liabilities in&#13;
the aggregate it cannot be assumed in particular cases that such assets&#13;
are necessarily under the control of the same entities holding the liabilities,&#13;
or that these assets would be otherwise available to meet external obligations.&#13;

rv.  TRENDS IN DEBT SERVICE AND THE TERMS OF DEBT&#13;
A. TOTAL DEBT SERVICE&#13;
Debt service payments are a lagged reflection of the amount and&#13;
terms of past lending. From 1970 to 1973, the debt service payments of all&#13;
developing countries taken together rose 110%, from $8.7 billion to $18.3&#13;
billion (see Table 14). This rate of growth reflects the shift toward&#13;
private sources of finance at shorter maturities which had begun in the&#13;
mid to late 1960s: debt service to official creditors during this period&#13;
rose 70%, while payments to private creditors increased by 128%. From 1973&#13;
to 1976, debt service payments rose by only 66%, from $18.3 billion to&#13;
$30.4 billion. This is in part a reflection of the lengthening of&#13;
maturities on new private-source loans during the early l970s. Amortization&#13;
payments rose by only 56% in 1973-76, while interest payments increased 89%.&#13;
In 1977, debt service rose by almost $9.0 billion--29%--to $39.1&#13;
billion. Higher interest payments reflected the increase in the stock of debt,&#13;
while amortization payments on long-term loans contracted in the early 1970's,&#13;
coincided with the expiration of grace periods on shorter-term loans of late&#13;
1974-75. Total amortization payments rose by an estimated 33% in 1977 alone.&#13;
The rise in debt service in 1977 was more than matched by increases in gross&#13;
borrowing and, as noted above, net borrowing was also well hbove immediate&#13;
needs.&#13;

Debt service payments have often been compared to export earnings&#13;
as a measure of change in the debt "burden' and of vulnerability of countries to debt&#13;
servicing and payments difficulties. The shortcomings of the debt service ratio as a&#13;
comprehensive indicator of indebtedness are well known.    Different economies&#13;
/1 See, for example, World Bank, "Prospects for Developing Countries, 1978-85,"&#13;
pp. 90-91.&#13;

have been able to sustain widely differing debt service ratios for long&#13;
periods.   The debt service ratio also hides the difference between interest&#13;
charges and debt repayment. Howe*er, changes over time in the debt service&#13;
ratio can be an indication of actual or potential debt servicing difficulties,&#13;
and is a useful tool of analysis as a measure of the contractual charge on&#13;
export earnings.&#13;
The debt service ratio of developing countries taken together has&#13;
remained remarkably stable, despite the increasing share of non-concessional&#13;
debt. For low income countries, the ratio fell slightly--from 13.7% to 12.6%--&#13;
from 1970 to 1977, while for middle income countries it rose from 10.2% to&#13;
11.8% over the same period (see Table 15). However, there are wide variations&#13;
among regions in both the level and changes in debt ratios, with the highest&#13;
overall ratio in upper middle income Latin American countries, and the largest&#13;
increase in lower middle income Latin America and in Southern Europe during&#13;
this period. Countries with notable increases in debt service ratios include&#13;
Bolivia, Chile, Jamaica, Mauritania, Mexico, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay (which&#13;
peaked at 46% in 1975. Countries with notable declines,&#13;
in some cases reflecting official rescheduling, include Egypt, India, Korea,&#13;
Pakistan and Tunisia. (The rescheduling arrangements for Pakistan were due&#13;
to expire, implying a rise in debt service in 1978-79.)&#13;

Jss differed after 1973 for oil-exporting countries compared to other&#13;

B. INTEREST&#13;
Interest charges reflect the cost of borrowed resources. 1/ Between&#13;
1970 and 1977, the weighted average interest rate of debt to official entities rose&#13;
by 0.9 percentage points to 3.8% (see Table 17). Average rates on privately-held debt&#13;
rose more rapidly, then dropped off in 1976-77 to 6.4% or 0.8 percentage points above&#13;
the 1970 level, reflecting the reduction of rates on floating rate loans. Because of&#13;
the relatively more rapid growth in debt to private than to official sources,&#13;
the average interest rate on total debt rose from 4.1% to 5.3% between 1970&#13;
and 1977. Interest rates on the debt of low income countries rose by one-half&#13;
a percentage point to 2.9%, while rates for middle income countries rose by&#13;
1.1 percentage point to 5.9%.    -&#13;
1/ Total costs may be somewhat higher than reflected in interest payments as&#13;
there may be one-time or other fees which may be charged by lenders. Changes&#13;
in exchange rates may also affect the US ollar cost of debt through valuation&#13;
changes dn both debt and on interest paymnts.&#13;

The advent of the widespread use of floating interest rates on loans&#13;
from financial institutions has altered some of the traditional relationships&#13;
regarding real interest rate calculations. Fixed rate loans confer a real gain&#13;
(or reduction in the cost of carrying debt) to the extent that there is an&#13;
acceleration in unanticipated inflation--as occurred during recent years.&#13;
Conversely, if inflation decelerates, the real cost of debt may rise. (This&#13;
point is separate, of course, from the general question of whether developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
countries have gained or lost overall from inflation.) Floating rate loans tend&#13;
to reduce the potential gains and losses for borrowers which can arise from&#13;
shifts in Inflation, as expectations about inflation are reflected in&#13;
short-term money market rates with respect to which floating rate loans are&#13;
adjusted, usually every six months. At the same time, floating interest rates&#13;
introduce additional uncertainty for borrowers, as the total nominal interest cost&#13;
of a floating rate loan, cannot be known except ex post. (Put another way, floating&#13;
rate loans introduce fluctuations in nominal interest rates, but tend to keep real&#13;
interest rates more constant than with fixed rate loans.) A further consideration&#13;
is that interest rates on floating rate loans are set at a margin above short&#13;
term interest rates, despite the long term maturity of the loan. For most periods,&#13;
short term rates have been lower than long term rates, although the differential&#13;
varies with conditions in the various markets, and at times the yield curve has&#13;
been inverse, as shown in Table 18.&#13;

C.  AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS, ROLLOVER RATIOS, AND MATURITIES ON NEW LOAN COMMITMENTF&#13;
Amortization payments increased less rapidly than debt or gross&#13;
borrowing during 1973-76, but rose sharply--by 33%--in 1977. Measured as a&#13;
proportion of gross borrowing, amortization payments declined from 41% in 1973&#13;
(40% in 1970) to 35% in 1976, before rising to 40% in 1977. The rise in&#13;
amortization liyments in 1977 aprears to ref3-ct some bunching of maturities&#13;
of debt to official agencies, combined with higher repayments for private-source&#13;
loans resulting from the rapid rise in borrowing and shorter maturities of loans&#13;
from these sources in 1974-75.&#13;
The average maturity of debt to official agencies is longer than that&#13;
to private lenders. This is indicated by the ratio of amortization payments&#13;
made during a year to debt outstanding as of the beginning of the year, a measure&#13;
of the "short term" portion of long term debt as well as the rate at which&#13;
debt is being repaid, or the rollover rate. About 5-6% of the debt to&#13;
official creditors is repaid in any year, while for private creditors the&#13;
range has been about 16-20%. The greater reliance of low income countries&#13;
on official sources of finance is reflected in the fact that in 1977, debt&#13;
repayments by countries were only 6% of disbursed debt outstanding at the&#13;
beginning of the year; in contrast for middle income countries the percentage&#13;
was 14% (see Table 19).&#13;
It may also be noted from Table 19 that amortization payments and&#13;
gross borrowing (disbursements) rose at about the same rate in 1970 to 1977.&#13;
Overall, debt repayments have been equivalent to about 40% of gross borrowing.&#13;
For official-source loans, the ratio has remained below 30%; for private-&#13;
source loans, it has remained mostly in the 40-45% range.&#13;

The average maturity of new commitments declined overall between&#13;
1970 and 1977 (see Table 20).   During this period, that for official loans&#13;
declined gradually from just over 26 years to just under 23 years. However,&#13;
maturities on loans from private sources rose from 1970 to 1973, as international&#13;
financial markets grew, perceptions of developing country risk declined, and&#13;
competition among banks increased as did the number of banks entering into&#13;
this lending activity.  Then, in late l9i4, a m.ore cauti~"_ approach to&#13;
international lending emerged in the wake of widely noted bank losses (none&#13;
of which involved developing countries) and a contraction of inter-bank&#13;
lending. Maturities of commitments from banks shortened sharply. Average&#13;
maturities of new bond issues declined even more and the spread&#13;
between average maturities of bond issues and direct loans from financial&#13;
institutions narrowed from 5.6 years in 1973 to 0.5 years in 1977.&#13;

By 1977 maturities on bank loans again lengthened notably, a trend&#13;
which strengthened considerably in 1978, as financial markets became more&#13;
liquid. As can be seen from Table 21, by 1978, almost 90% of publicized&#13;
loans in the Eurocurrency credit markets were contracted at maturities of&#13;
more than 5 years, compared with just under 30X in 1975; over 62% were for more&#13;
than 7 years, compared with less than 10% in just a year earlier.&#13;

D. MATURITY STRUCTURE OF OUTSTANDING DEBT:  PROJECTED REPAYMENTS&#13;
Estimates of future debt repayments on debt contracted before 1978&#13;
have been made based on the amortization schedules reported to the Bank and on&#13;
assumptions made about disbursements of undrawn balances.   Actual future&#13;
amortization payments will, of course, also be affected by new borrowing as&#13;
well as rearrangements of existing debt, both of which have occurred; however,&#13;
these schedules are still indicative of debt profiles.&#13;
Two broad patterns can be discerned: (a) amortization of loans from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
private sources were scheduled to peak in 1979-80 at about $30 billion,&#13;
37% above the level of payments made in 1977 of $21.8 billion, but to fall&#13;
back even more rapidly to $14.5 billion by 1983 and $7.1 billion by 1985;&#13;
(b) repayment of officially-held debt was scheduled to rise to $6.9 billion&#13;
in 1979 (from $4.7 billion in 1977) and thereafter remain within a $1 billion&#13;
range around $8 billion per year through 1988, peaking at $8.8 billion in&#13;
1981-83 (see Table 22). (It should be noted, however, as a result of borrowing&#13;
after 1977 from private sources some flattening of the decline in scheduled&#13;
amortization payments in the 1980's may be expected to result.) Expressed in&#13;
terms of outstanding debt (including undisbursed debt) at the end of 1977, nearly&#13;
50% of the total was due to be repaid by 1982. The share of debt owed to private&#13;
creditors was considerably higher, just under 73%. Only 24% of officially-held&#13;
debt is scheduled to be repaid by 1982, 50% by 1987.&#13;

These broad patterns of the maturity profile of debt imply that,&#13;
overall, there is relatively little scope for low income countries to ease&#13;
their debt service payments through deferring current and near-term&#13;
obligations to the late 1980s, especially in view of their growth prospects.&#13;
New borrowing by these countries must be at very long term to avoid a rapid&#13;
increase in amortization payments, which, in relation to exports are already&#13;
almost as high as they are for middle income countries (see Table 23). However,&#13;
an increasing proportion of assistance to low income countries is being&#13;
provided on softer terms than in the past or in the form of grants. For the&#13;
least developed countries, debt cancellation or other retroactive adjustments&#13;
in the terms of debt have been announced or are under consideration by some&#13;
creditor governments.&#13;
Middle income countries, in particular with respect to their debt&#13;
owed to private sources, are facing high amortization payments over the next&#13;
few years. At the same time, however, these countries have considerable room&#13;
overall for rearranging the maturity profile of their debt, because of the&#13;
rapid fall in scheduled debt repayments in the mid-1980s. To some extent,&#13;
this rearrangement has already occurred: a number of countries have taken&#13;
advantage of the favorable conditions in financial markets, particularly in&#13;
1978 and 1979, to prepay, renegotiate, or refinance their debt on more&#13;
favorable terms. The major borrowing countries are known to be highly&#13;
conscious of these opportunities. These changes cannot now be quantified&#13;
for developing countries in general, but it will become apparent as new&#13;
amortization schedules become available.&#13;
A measure of the rise in scheduled amortization payments through&#13;
1980 by income group and for 20 selected countries is shown in Table 23.&#13;

The variety of maturity schedules among countries is also evident. The most&#13;
rapid percentage increases in amortization payments among the countries shown&#13;
were scheduled for Algeria, Morocco, Iran, and the Philippines, from&#13;
relatively low bases in relation to exports, and for Turkey and Peru, both&#13;
of which have since experienced severe debt servicing difficulties. 1/ In&#13;
relation to 1977 exports, the scheduled rise in amortization payments by&#13;
1980 was largest for Algeria and Morocco from a low base, and Brazil,&#13;
Mexico, and Peru, all from high initial levels.&#13;
E. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN REARRANGEMEFNT t DEBT&#13;
Debt Forgiveness&#13;
The servicing of past debts of low income countries, particularly&#13;
the least developed, has been recognized as a claim on resources which are&#13;
very scarce in the context of their overall development. Many past loans&#13;
.from government agencies were contracted at harder terms than the policies&#13;
of governments currently prescribe. As noted earlier, the long maturity&#13;
of these loans, although an element of concessionality, also implies&#13;
relatively little scope for alleviating debt servicing problems through medium&#13;
term rescheduling.&#13;
These issues were the subject of discussions at the Conference&#13;
on International Economic Cooperation in Paris in 1977 and have brought forth&#13;
official responses. At the March 1978 ministerial meeting of UNCTAD, governments&#13;
1/   The relatively low amortization/export ratios shown for Turkey in Table&#13;
23 do not reflect its high level of short term obligations, some of which&#13;
have since, or are expected to be, consolidated into long-term debt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
agreed to "seek to adopt adjustment measures on the official development&#13;
assistance debt of the poorer developing countries." In November, 1978, the&#13;
UNCTAD Secretariat reported that major creditor countries had announced plans&#13;
to convert $6.2 billion in loans owed to them into grants, which was estimated&#13;
to represent an annual debt servicing saving of some $300 million. 1/ The&#13;
details of the creditor plans for what is termed "retroactive adjustment of&#13;
terms," including the modalities and amounts involved for each affected debtor&#13;
country, have not been fully established. For some important creditor&#13;
countries, the implementation of these goals may be expected to be only on a&#13;
case by case basis.&#13;
Conversion of loans to grants is advantageous to debtor countries&#13;
in that it provides an immediate release of untied foreign exchange that&#13;
otherwise would have been earmarked for debt service, in contrast to new loans&#13;
which are typically tied and disbursed only after a lag and over a considerable&#13;
period. However, it is not clear that assistance provided in the form of debt&#13;
relief will be additional to more traditional assistance.&#13;
Rescheduling&#13;
Some countries have run into payments difficulties which have&#13;
required accommodation by creditors in the form of debt rescheduling. Notable&#13;
among these in recent years are Turkey, Peru, and Zaire. Although the&#13;
particular circumstances of these cases differ in important respects, a few&#13;
points of general significance stand out. First, all three countries had a&#13;
substantial amount of debt to banks (in relation to other debt and in relation&#13;
to their deposits with banks), but the response of the financial markets was&#13;
not to generalize from this experience to other borrowers in such a way as to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

limit overall lending to devhloping countries. However, banks are reported to&#13;
be placing greater emphasis on sovereign risk assessment, and the capacity&#13;
of banks to do this is a matter in which bank supervisory authorities,&#13;
particularly in the U.S., have taken a greater interest. Second, all thTee&#13;
countries have used the facilities of the IMF, and accepted conditions&#13;
concerning adjustments to their economies, which may enhance their options&#13;
for future borrowing. Third, in all three cases adverse developments in foreign&#13;
earnings had been combined with domestic economic and/or political difficulties.&#13;
Market Rearrangements&#13;
A steep rise of amortization payments by middle income countries&#13;
to private creditors in 1976-78 coincided with improvements in the current&#13;
account positions of these countries overall and very liquid conditions&#13;
in financial markets. These conditions led to the easing of the terms for&#13;
new loans from the markets, as discussed earlier. The result has been a&#13;
considerable improvement in the liquidity position of these countries,&#13;
achieved by (a) the replacement of old loans coming due with new loans at&#13;
longer maturities and lower spreads; (b) borrowing of amounts in excess of&#13;
current (or anticipation of future) needs and redepositing of the proceeds,&#13;
reflected in higher levels of reserves and other foreign assets; and (c) to&#13;
a more limited extent, renegotiation of old loans to reflect current conditions,&#13;
and/or early repayment of these loans, combined with new borrowing. These&#13;
activities may be seen as part of a growing sophistication of developing&#13;
countries, many of which are actively managing the structure of their external&#13;
assets and liabilities to take advantage of changes in market conditions. It&#13;
also points to their growing importance as the users of private banking services,&#13;
and the continued development of competition among banks for business relationships&#13;
with developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION&#13;
Developing countries have made use of foreign loans to finance their&#13;
imports, as a supplement to domestic sources of funds for investment, and for&#13;
purposes of overall balance of payments and economic management.  Net borrowing&#13;
by these countries has increased rapidly, from a total of $9.3 billion in 1970&#13;
to an average of $36.6 billion in 1975-77, an annual average rate of growth of&#13;
almost 26% in current US dollars, Borrowing rose in relation to the imports of&#13;
these countries, from the equivalent of 9.6% of their imports in 1970 to 11.1%&#13;
in 1975-77.&#13;
This expansion of borrowing was reflected in an increase of out-&#13;
standing debt which averaged 21% per year, going from $57.1 billion at the&#13;
end of 1969 to $258.5 billion at the end of 1977. Despite the shocks in the&#13;
international economy after 1973, the rate of growth of outstanding debt did&#13;
not increase appreciably in the four years from the end of 1973 to the end of&#13;
1977 as compared with the previous four-year period. Indeed, in constant US&#13;
dollars, the rate of growth of debt slowed down.&#13;
Private lenders have become increasingly important as sources of&#13;
finance, and accounted for 64% of the rise in debt from the end of 1969 to the&#13;
end of 1977; the share of total debt outstanding of developing countries owed to&#13;
private creditors increased from 45% to 60% during this period. The most rapid&#13;
increase has been in public and publicly-guaranteed borrowing from private banks;&#13;
this debt has increased at an annual rate of over 40% during this period. The&#13;
greater reliance by developing countries on loans from banks relative to other&#13;
sources of finance has paralleled the expansion of international financial markets,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
and in particular the development of the syndicated Eurocurrency credit market,&#13;
where developing countries have accounted for over 50% of the publicized&#13;
loans arranged since 1975.&#13;
Viewing the rise of debt against other economic changes, the ratio&#13;
of outstanding debt to GNP in developing countries rose from just under 16%&#13;
in 1970 to just under 21% in 1977. In relation to exports, however, debt de-&#13;
clined from over 87% in 1970 to just under 83% in 1977. The difference in&#13;
the performance of these two ratios reflected the rapid increase in exports and&#13;
their growing contribution to GNP during this period.  However, if the major&#13;
oil exporting countries, which experienced a sharp increase in export earnings&#13;
after 1973, are excluded, the ratio of debt to exports in other developing countries&#13;
rose somewhat, from 91% in 1973 to 102% in 1977.&#13;
External debt may also be assessed in relation to the growth of&#13;
reserves and other external assets, especially as many borrowers have used the&#13;
proceeds of loans to build up these assets. At the end of 1977, official&#13;
reserves (a liquid asset) were equal to 40% of outstanding debt; private banks'&#13;
outstanding liabilities to developing countries were equal to 85% of their claims&#13;
on these countries, 64% if oil exporting countries are excluded, at the end&#13;
of 1978.&#13;
There is a complementary pattern in the sources of finance used by&#13;
countries at different levels of per capita income. About 94% of debt owed&#13;
to private sources at the end of 1977 was by middle-income countries, accounting&#13;
for 67% of the total debt of these countries. By contrast, 71% of the debt of&#13;
low income countries was from official sources on concessional terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Loans from private sources are both more costly, as measured by their&#13;
interest rate, and at shorter maturities than loans from official sources. Amor-&#13;
tization payments on debt owed to private sources have been equal to about 16-&#13;
20% of the debt outstanding to these sources in any year, while for debt owed to&#13;
official sources, this ratio has been 5-6%. About 70% of the debt outstanding to&#13;
private sources at the end of 1977 was scheduled to be repaid in five years, com-&#13;
pared to 24% for official-source debt.&#13;
The greater reliance on private sources of finance by middle-income&#13;
countries compared with low-income countries is both a reflection of and a con-&#13;
tribution to the very different sets of external debt and balance of payments&#13;
management issues that these two groups of countries face. For middle-income&#13;
countries, the higher rollover ratio of outstanding debt, and the need for con-&#13;
tinual access to private financial markets, places a premium on the maintenance&#13;
of sound economic policies and financial management, and the perceptions thereof&#13;
among lenders. The greater availability of private finance in recent years has&#13;
given these countries greater scope for external financial management, as it has&#13;
increased the vulnerability of these countries to uncertainties in the inter-&#13;
national environment. Private lenders, too, have had to pay increasing&#13;
attention to the assessment and management of risk in their international&#13;
portfolios. Consequently, mutual incentives have been created for sound policy&#13;
and an open international system.&#13;
For low income countries, the level and pattern of future debt&#13;
service precludes the taking on of significant new amounts of debt on other&#13;
than concessional terms, in the context of their overall development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

programs. It has been recognized that, particularly for the least&#13;
developed countries, debt relief is appropriate, in the form of cancellation&#13;
or other retractive adjustment of the terms of debt, at least in particular&#13;
cases. The debt problems of these countries may be seen as a part of the&#13;
overall scarcity of resources available to them for development.&#13;

            This paper reviews the growth and
            changing structure of the external debt of developing
            countries, including their private, non-guaranteed debt,
            during the period 1970 through 1977. It discusses these
            developments in relation to other economic changes during
            this period, as well as the growth of external assets.
            Trends in debt service and the cost of debt are reviewed,
            along with a prospective look at patterns of debt amortization.
