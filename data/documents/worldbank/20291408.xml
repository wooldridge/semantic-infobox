to the Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise&#13;
apply to a fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this&#13;
Administration Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the&#13;
Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended&#13;
from time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and&#13;
safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening&#13;
procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the&#13;
Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under&#13;
Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this&#13;
provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset&#13;
control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country that may&#13;
apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and&#13;
shall be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund may be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its&#13;
capacity as trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2   The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is the United States&#13;

Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where&#13;
deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations,&#13;
neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional&#13;
financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the&#13;
date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5   The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the&#13;
investment of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such&#13;
investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.    Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1   The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to one percent (1%) per Installment as an administrative fee for&#13;
the Trust Fund. In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for Trust&#13;
Fund administration, that are: (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee; and (ii) not included under Annex I of the Administration Arrangements in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust&#13;

Contributions under all Administration Arrangements.&#13;

coordination of GEQIP, including the Trust Fund activities funded by this Trust Fund, the Bank&#13;
may charge the Trust Fund's aggregate contributions from all donors, costs directly attributed to&#13;
such activities in an amount not to exceed zero point nine three percent (0.93%) of Donor&#13;
contributions. This allocation reflects the current requirements for enhanced supervision for the&#13;
management and coordination of GEQIP, including the Trust Fund. It may be amended, from&#13;
time to time, in agreement with all Trust Fund Donors to address any additional requirements&#13;
for program supervision.&#13;
3.3   Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this&#13;
Trust Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If&#13;
actual Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of&#13;
signature of the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund&#13;
fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new&#13;
Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration&#13;
Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
