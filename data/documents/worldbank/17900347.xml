                     The proportion of children completing primary school in Sub-Saharan Af-&#13;
                     rica rose from 51 percent in 1991 to 64 percent in 2008. This still leaves&#13;
                     the region far short of the Millennium Development Goal of universal pri-&#13;
                     mary education. But rapid progress is possible. The primary completion&#13;
                     rate for 7 countriesâ&#128;&#148;Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ethiopia, Madagascar,&#13;
                     Mozambique and Nigerâ&#128;&#148;more than doubled between 1991 and 2009.&#13;
                     Still large differences persist between rich and poor within countries. In&#13;
                     some low-income countries, such as Benin, the completion rates for the&#13;
                     richest quintile are 95 percent or higher, but completion rates for the&#13;
                     poorest quintile are 35 percent or less. And there is a 9 percentage point&#13;
                     gap in the completion rates for boys and girls.&#13;

                     Use of biomass energy for cooking and heating&#13;
                     poses health risks for Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
                     Many poor people depend on biomass energy from plant materials or&#13;
                     animal wastes for cooking and heating. Millions of deaths are caused by&#13;
                     air pollution. Many are children in developing countries, who die of acute&#13;
                     respiratory infections due to indoor air pollution resulting from burning&#13;
                     fuel wood, crop residues, or animal dung. Half the people in the world&#13;
                     use biomass or coal for cooking. For Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 28&#13;
                     percent of households (excluding South Africa) have electrical service,&#13;
                     biomass and coal are the primary cooking fuel for over 75 percent of the&#13;
                     population and account for 58 percent of all energy use.&#13;
&#13;
                     Agriculture output lags as African economies grow&#13;
                     The economies of Sub-Saharan Africa are gradually shifting towards in-&#13;
                     dustry and services. Although agricultural output grew by 3.0 percent a&#13;
                     year between 1990 and 2009, the share of agriculture in Sub-Saharan&#13;
                     Africaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP fell from 19 to 13 percent. Food production increased by&#13;
                     more than 78 percent from 1990, slightly faster than the growth of popu-&#13;
                     lation. To increase output more land has been brought into production,&#13;
                     but yields have lagged. Land area under cereal production increased by&#13;
                     43 percent to 96 million hectares in 2009, but cereal yields (output per&#13;
                     hectare) increased by only 26 percent over the period and agricultural&#13;
                     productivity (value added per worker) increased by less than 5 percent,&#13;
                     the lowest in the developing world.&#13;

                     External sector lead recovery in 2010&#13;
                     GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa expanded by 4.7 percent in 2010, up from 1.7&#13;
                     percent in 2009. South Africa, the regionâ&#128;&#153;s largest economy, grew more&#13;
                     slowly at 2.7 percent, but that was an improvement over the previous&#13;
                     year when output fell by 1.8 percent. While a resilient domestic demand&#13;
                     supported growth during 2009, the recovery in 2010 was bolstered by&#13;
                     the external sector through stronger export volumes, raising commodity&#13;
                     prices, higher foreign direct investment, and a recovery in tourism.&#13;
&#13;
                     Four Sub-Saharan African countries are&#13;

                     reformers of the past 5 years&#13;
                     In the last five years Rwanda, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mali, ranked in&#13;
                     the top ten of 174 of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s countries in making their regulatory envi-&#13;
                     ronment more favorable to business. Rwanda implemented 22 business&#13;
                     regulation reforms which included reducing the time it takes to register a&#13;
                     business in 2010 to 3 days and 8.9 percent of per capita income down&#13;
                     from 18 days at a cost of 200 percent of per capita income in 2005.&#13;
                     During this time, Ghana created its first credit bureau, computerized its&#13;
                     business registry, and overhauled its property registration system.&#13;
&#13;
                     Volatile food and energy prices pose a&#13;
                     challenge for many economies&#13;
                     Food imports on average account for 11 percent of Sub-Saharan Africaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                     total merchandise imports, and many economies are net food importers.&#13;
                     For nearly half, the share of food in total merchandise imports exceed 15&#13;
                     percent. Some are particularly vulnerable. The share of food imports in&#13;
                     total imports for the last 5 years averaged 33 percent for the Gambia,&#13;
                     32 percent for SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, 29 percent for Cape Verde, 28&#13;
                     percent for Niger, and 25 percent for Senegal.&#13;
                         The region as a whole is a net exporter of energy. The main exporters&#13;
                     include Republic of Congo, Angola, Gabon, Sudan, Nigeria, and South&#13;
                     Africa, which stand to benefit from rising world energy prices. For these&#13;
                     economies the challenge is to use their windfalls wisely. However, the&#13;
                     region also has many economies that are dependent on energy imports.&#13;
                     For example, net energy imports account for 82 percent of Namibiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                     total energy use, 57 percent of Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s, 53 percent of Botswanaâ&#128;&#153;s, 39&#13;
                     percent of Beninâ&#128;&#153;s, 28 percent of Ghanaâ&#128;&#153;s. Some of these economies&#13;
                     may face acute deterioration of their balance of payments positions.&#13;

                     Opportunities and obstacles for women&#13;
                     Middle East and North Africa has made impressive gains in womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                     health and education outcomes. The total fertility rate nearly halved, from&#13;
                     4.9 births per woman ages 15-49 in 1990 to 2.7 in 2009, reflecting a&#13;
                     large increase in contraceptive prevalence from 42 percent to 62 per-&#13;
                     cent. In the Islamic Republic of Iran the total fertility rate fell from 4.8 in&#13;
                     1990 to 1.8 in 2009. Female life expectancy improved by 13 years be-&#13;
                     tween 1980 and 2009, the largest improvement in any region. Womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                     secondary enrollment rates increased from 46 percent to 70 percent&#13;
                     between 1991 and 2008, and tertiary enrollment rates almost tripled&#13;
                     from 9 percent to 26 percent. The gender gaps at all levels of education&#13;
                     are closing.&#13;
                         But these achievements did not transfer into the work force. Womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                     employment remains at about 20 percent â&#128;&#147; by far the lowest among all&#13;
                     regions. More than half of the employed women were vulnerable workers,&#13;
                     self-employed or working for family businesses, who were less likely to&#13;
                     have social protection and safety nets to guard against economic shocks.&#13;
                     Morocco has the highest level of vulnerable employment for both men (46&#13;
                     percent) and women (65 percent).&#13;
&#13;
                     Energy use growing faster than production&#13;
                     Energy producers tend to be energy users. In 2008 the low- and middle-&#13;
                     income economies of Middle East and North Africa produced 53 percent&#13;
                     more energy compared to their 1990 level, but they consumed 133 per-&#13;
                     cent more energy and energy use per capita increased by 63 percent. The&#13;
                     average growth of energy use in the regionâ&#128;&#148;4.7 percent a year between&#13;
                     1990 and 2008â&#128;&#148;was the fastest in the world. Over the same period&#13;
                     emission of carbon dioxide increased by 103 percent, with a 48 percent&#13;
                     increase in per capita emissions.&#13;

             Faster growth but health and education outcomes lag&#13;
             Economic growth and rising labor productivity has reduced poverty in&#13;
             South Asia, home to half the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poor people living below $1.25 a&#13;
             day. Labor productivity almost doubled between 1991 and 2008 (from&#13;
             $3,600 to $7,200 per person employed), the second largest growth after&#13;
             East Asia and Pacific. However, vulnerable employment remains high,&#13;
             especially in rural areas. In Bangladesh, 85 percent of employed people&#13;
             are vulnerable workers. Educational deficits remain a limitation on the&#13;
             regionâ&#128;&#153;s development prospects: the adult literacy rate stands at 62 per-&#13;
             cent. Literacy rates are higher among young people, but fewer than 80&#13;
             percent of eligible children completed primary school in 2009.&#13;
                  South Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s spending on health careâ&#128;&#148;4 percent of GDPâ&#128;&#148;was the&#13;
             lowest among all regions, and more than half was made directly by house-&#13;
             holds. Over 40 percent of children were underweight, and, despite recent&#13;
             improvement, the immunization rate against measles remained one of&#13;
             the lowest of all regions (75 percent in 2009). The slow improvement&#13;
             in the under-five mortality rate (125 in 1990 to 71 per 1,000 in 2009)&#13;
             reflects the onerous task that the region faces in trying to reach the MDG&#13;
             goal of reducing child mortality. Only Bangladesh, Maldives, and Pakistan&#13;
             are on track to achieve the target.&#13;
                  Many women in South Asia lack adequate reproductive health care.&#13;
             Maternal mortality (290 per 100,000 live births) in 2008 was second only&#13;
             to Sub-Saharan Africa. Only 47 percent of births were assisted by skilled&#13;
             health staff, and 70 percent of pregnant women received prenatal care.&#13;
             Exceptions are Maldives and Sri Lanka, where the prenatal care and the&#13;
             attended births are almost universal, and maternal mortality ratios are as&#13;
             low as in Europe and Central Asia, which has the lowest maternal mortal-&#13;
             ity ratio of all developing regions.&#13;
&#13;
             Energy use in South Asia lowest&#13;
             among developing regions&#13;
             Per capita energy use in South Asia remained the lowest among all other&#13;
             regions even after increasing by 42 percentâ&#128;&#148;from 348 kilograms of oil&#13;
             equivalent in 1990 to 495 kilograms in 2008. But the structure of fuel&#13;
             use is also changing. South Asia now relies more on fossil fuels and&#13;
             less on combustible renewables and waste. Economic growth and energy&#13;
             use move together. High-income economies use more than four times&#13;
             as much energy per capita as middle-income economies and 14 times&#13;
             as much as low-income economies. With only 16 percent of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
             population, high income economies use about half of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s energy&#13;
             production each year.&#13;

             Huge improvement, but sanitation&#13;
             facilities still lacking&#13;
             Between 1990 and 2008 the share of the population in South Asia with&#13;
             access to improved sanitation facilities increased from 22 to 36 percent.&#13;
             Improvements were greatest in rural areas, with India making the great-&#13;
             est contribution. Still only 27 percent of the rural population and about&#13;
             half of the urban population have access to improved sanitation facilities.&#13;
             Large investments will be required to reach the Millennium Development&#13;
             Goal, which calls for reducing by half the share of the population without&#13;
             access to basic sanitation.&#13;

             Information and communications technology services dominate the ser-&#13;

             of ICT service exports as a percent of total services exports was 53&#13;
             percentâ&#128;&#148;among the highest in the world. Next behind India in South Asia&#13;
             was Sri Lanka with 17 percent. Information and communication technol-&#13;
             ogy services directly or indirectly affect peopleâ&#128;&#153;s lives everywhere. Infor-&#13;
             mation and communication technologies are enabling tools used in all&#13;
             sectors, ranging from telecommunication infrastructure (voice, data, and&#13;
             media services) to information applications in banking and finance, land&#13;
             management, education, health, and electronic government services.&#13;
&#13;
             Fewer women in business management and ownership&#13;
             Womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation in business ownership and management in South&#13;
             Asia is the lowest among developing country regions. Women in South&#13;
             Asia, as in other regions, face barriers to participation in the economy,&#13;
             and often benefit from enabling business environment reforms in cus-&#13;
             toms, business registration, and tax administration. The percentage of&#13;
             firms in South Asia with low rates of female participation in ownership&#13;
             include: Afghanistan (2.8 percent), Pakistan (6.7 percent), and India (9.1&#13;
             percent). Women participation is better in Bangladesh, where 16.1 per-&#13;
             cent of firms have female participation in ownership.&#13;

                    Monitoring national poverty lines&#13;
                    The international definition of extreme poverty is consumption of less&#13;
                    than $1.25 per person a day, but in middle-income regions such as Latin&#13;
                    America and the Caribbean, countries set national poverty lines at a high-&#13;
                    er level. In the past decade, 19 countries in the region have conducted&#13;
                    two or more comparable surveys, allowing them to measure progress in&#13;
                    reducing poverty. In 9 countries the reduction national poverty rates has&#13;
                    exceeded 2 percent a year. Inequality hampers efforts to reduce poverty&#13;
                    faster. Except for Chile, all Latin American countries with recent data have&#13;
                    Gini coefficients greater than 40, indicating a high level of inequality.&#13;
&#13;
                    Clean and efficient&#13;
                    Latin American and the Caribbean is the most efficient energy user in the&#13;
                    world, measured by the ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) to energy&#13;
                    use. Latin American countries produced an average of $7.7 of output&#13;
                    for every kilogram of oil equivalent energy used in 2008, a 12 percent&#13;
                    improvement over 1990. Use of alternative, non-carbon energy sources&#13;
                    â&#128;&#147; such as nuclear, geothermal, solar, and hydropower â&#128;&#147; is also on the&#13;
                    increase. Alternative energy made up about 9 percent of world energy&#13;
                    use in 2008 but 11 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, highest&#13;
                    among developing regions. This slowed, but did not stop, the increase&#13;
                    in carbon dioxide emissions. Between 1990 and 2007 emissions of the&#13;
                    carbon dioxide in Latin America rose by more than 50 percent.&#13;
&#13;
                    Latin America is more urban than European Union&#13;
                    With 79 percent of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s population living in urban areas in 2009,&#13;
                    Latin America was more urban than European Union. Urbanization can&#13;
                    yield important social benefits and improve to the delivery of public ser-&#13;
                    vices. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 86 percent of the urban popu-&#13;
                    lation has access to improved sanitation facilities, while only 54 percent&#13;
                    of the rural population enjoys such access. But urbanization can also&#13;
                    be associated with adverse environmental effects. For example, greater&#13;
                    urbanization is often associated with more concentrated pollution, harm-&#13;
                    ing health and reducing productivity. Urbanization is also associated with&#13;
                    greater numbers of motor vehicles and traffic congestion and higher emis-&#13;
                    sions of carbon dioxide.&#13;

                    Time lost on taxes&#13;
                    In the past six years more than 60 percent of the countries covered by&#13;
                    the Doing Business project made paying taxes easier or lowered the tax&#13;
                    burden for local enterprises. But Latin American and Caribbean lags other&#13;
                    regions. Countries that make paying taxes easy for domestic firms usually&#13;
                    offer electronic systems for tax filing and payment, have one tax per tax&#13;
                    base, and use a filing system based on self-assessment. The average&#13;
                    firm in Latin America and the Caribbean spends about 400 hours a year&#13;
                    preparing, filing, and paying taxes. Countries in the region that make it&#13;
                    relatively easy for firms to pay business taxes are Costa Rica (272 hours&#13;
                    per year) and Honduras (224 hours per year). But others, such as Bolivia&#13;
                    (1,080 hours per year), Brazil (2,600 hours per year), and Venezuela RB&#13;
                    (864 hours per year) have regulations and processes that make it more&#13;
                    difficult for firms to pay business taxes.&#13;
&#13;
                    Remittances decline&#13;
                    In 2009 remittance flows to Latin America and the Caribbean declined&#13;
                    by 12 percent, the first drop after a long period of consistent growth. The&#13;
                    recession in the United States economy, the major remittances sending&#13;
                    country, had a strong impact on the volume of remittances. Remittances&#13;
                    received by Mexico dropped by 16 percent in 2009. Other countries in&#13;
                    the region experienced decreases, such as Colombia (14 percent) and&#13;
                    the Dominican Republic (11 percent). Brazil experienced the largest drop&#13;
                    (17 percent), but this was partly due return of migrants encouraged by the&#13;
                    good performance of Brazilian economy and because of the job losses in&#13;
                    hosting economies worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
                    Changing investment patterns&#13;
                    Net inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Latin America and the&#13;
                    Caribbean fell by 42 percent in 2009, carried down by a 43 percent de-&#13;
                    crease in Brazil and a 51 percent decline in Mexico, the two largest re-&#13;
                    gional recipients. Although investments in the hydrocarbon sector typi-&#13;
                    cally held up worldwide in 2009, this was not the case of Venezuela&#13;
                    where appropriation of some FDI claims deterred investors and led to&#13;
                    a $3.1 billion net outflow of FDI in 2009, a marked turnaround from the&#13;
                    $10.1 billion and $3.5 billion FDI inflows to the country in 2007 and 2008&#13;
                    respectively.&#13;
                        The decline in FDI inflows was partly offset by the surge in portfolio&#13;
                    equity inflows, which rebounded in response to economic recovery that&#13;
                    proceeded at a faster pace in the region than had been expected. The&#13;
                    main driver was Brazil with inflows of $37 billion in 2009, 90 percent of&#13;
                    the regional total, in contrast to the $7.6 billion outflow in 2008. Mex-&#13;
                    ico, the only other significant recipient of portfolio equity inflows also&#13;
                    recorded a net inflow ($4.2 billion) in 2009 compared to a net outflow of&#13;
                    $3.5 billion in 2008.&#13;

                      to do so. Maternal health is also improving: the contraceptive prevalence&#13;
                      rate was the highest of all regions (77 percent); 91 percent of pregnant&#13;
                      women received prenatal care; and 89 percent of births were assisted by&#13;
                      skilled health staff. Labor productivity has increased rapidly, but the vul-&#13;

                      and Indonesia ranked the first and the sixth. At the same time, use of&#13;

                      The East Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s recovery is firmly on track, with real gross domestic&#13;
                      product (GDP), industrial production, and exports above pre-crisis levels.&#13;
                      Thanks to continued strong growth, China became the second largest&#13;
                      economy in the world measured at market exchange rates in 2010. Rapid&#13;
                      expansion also returned to Cambodia and Mongolia, whose economies&#13;
                      contracted in 2009. The rebound among the regionâ&#128;&#153;s resource-rich econ-&#13;
                      omies reflects the rapid increase in global demand for commodities. This&#13;
                      strong demand is transforming the economies of commodity-producing&#13;
                      regions in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam.&#13;

East Asia and the Pacific&#13;

&#13;
                      Exports are growing at a faster&#13;
                      pace than before the crisis&#13;
                      The rapid emergence of East Asia as the worldâ&#128;&#153;s export powerhouse&#13;
                      was complemented by surging final demand within the region, notably in&#13;
                      China. East Asia is not only selling more to the world, it is buying more.&#13;
                      Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s strong growth in output and import demand during the recovery&#13;
                      provided crucial support to regional and global trade. The regionâ&#128;&#153;s share&#13;
                      of global trade today is almost three times greater than two decades ago,&#13;
                      while Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s share of global trade has increased by a factor of five.&#13;
                           The recovery in trade also boosted net capital inflows from private&#13;
                      creditors (mostly trade-related financing) in 2009 to eleven times their&#13;
                      2008 level. Most borrowers in the region recorded inflows of short term&#13;
                      debt but China was the principal destination. Its net short term debt&#13;
                      inflows rose 28 percent over the 2008 level to $241 billion. Exceptions to&#13;
                      the regional trend were the Philippines with an outflow of short term debt&#13;
                      of $3 billion in 2009 and Indonesia, with a more moderate $0.4 billion&#13;
                      outflow.&#13;
&#13;
                      Business tax rates lowest in East Asia and Pacific&#13;
                      Taxes fund a broad range of social and economic programs, national&#13;
                      defense, and other purposes such as redistributing income to the aged&#13;
                      and unemployed. Countries with well designed tax systems have the rev-&#13;
                      enues to provide essential services and at the same time help the growth&#13;
                      of businesses, investment, and employment. In an effort to create more&#13;
                      jobs and growth, 8 countries in the region reduced the total business&#13;
                      tax rate in 2009/2010. In 2010, the average total business tax rate as&#13;
                      a percentage of commercial profits for East Asia and Pacific countries&#13;
                      was about 36 percent, the lowest among developing country regions and&#13;
                      developed, high-income economies. Countries with low total business&#13;
                      tax rates as a percent of commercial profits include: Vanuatu (8 percent),&#13;
                      Samoa (19 percent), and Tonga (26 percent). Countries with higher rates&#13;
                      are Palau (73 percent), Marshall Islands (65 percent), and Philippines (46&#13;
                      percent).&#13;

                      East Asia tourists on the move&#13;
                      Spending on tourism by the residents of East Asia and Pacific increased&#13;
                      by 8 percent between 2008 and 2009, while spending by residents of&#13;
                      all other developing regions declined by 7 to 30 percent. This increase&#13;
                      was largely due to increased spending by tourists from China (15 percent&#13;
                      increase) and the Philippines (17 percent increase). The region now ac-&#13;
                      counts for 34 percent of all tourism related spending by residents of&#13;
                      developing economies. China alone accounts for 21 percent of the to-&#13;
                      tal spending on international tourism by developing economies. At $47&#13;
                      billion, Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s spending on international tourism in 2009 exceeded re-&#13;

Europe and Central Asia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     Social indicators show strengths and vulnerabilities&#13;
                     Europe and Central Asia has achieved a high level of social development.&#13;
                     Ninety-six percent of all eligible children finish primary school and more&#13;
                     than 80 percent enroll in secondary school. The under-five mortality rate&#13;
                     (21 per 1,000) and the maternal mortality ratio (32 per 100,000 live&#13;
                     births) are the lowest among developing regions. The region also has the&#13;
                     highest rate of access to improved water and sanitation facilities.&#13;
                         However there are concerns. Half of all the unemployed people have&#13;
                     a secondary education, indicating difficulty in finding a job or mismatch&#13;
                     of the skills between education and market needs. The prevalence of HIV&#13;
                     in 2009 (0.6 percent) was 6 times higher than in 1990. The incidence&#13;
                     of tuberculosis also increased between 1990 (88 per 100,000 people)&#13;
                     and 2000 (101 per 100,000 people) and only returned to the 1990 level&#13;
                     in 2009. Adult mortality rates remain high, especially for men. Lifestyle&#13;
                     choices may have much to do with this: the region has a highest preva-&#13;
                     lence of smoking for men (58%) and women (22%).&#13;
&#13;
                     Carbon dioxide emissions decrease but&#13;
                     per capita emissions remain high&#13;
                     Carbon dioxide emissions, largely a by-product of energy production and&#13;
                     use, account for the largest share of greenhouse gasses and resulting&#13;
                     environmental damage. In 2007 the world released 30,649 million metric&#13;
                     tons of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide emissions per capita increased&#13;
                     globally by 36 percent between 1990 and 2007. In Europe and Central&#13;
                     Asia, carbon dioxide emissions per capita fell by 33 percent over the&#13;
                     same period, but at an average of 7.2 metric tons they remain the high-&#13;
                     est in the worldâ&#128;&#148;almost seven times greater than South Asia and Sub-&#13;
                     Saharan Africa, three times greater than Latin America or East Asia, and&#13;
                     two times greater than the Middle East and North Africa. Methane and&#13;
                     nitrous oxide emissions also fell in the region, while the share of alterna-&#13;
                     tive and nuclear energy in total energy use rose to 4 percent in 2008.&#13;
                     The Russian Federation was the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide,&#13;
                     behind China and the United States, and the third largest contributor to&#13;
                     the methane emissions after China and India.&#13;

                     Agriculture is a declining industry in Europe and Central Asia. Agricul-&#13;
                     tureâ&#128;&#153;s share of regional GDP fell by almost half, from 14 percent to 8 per-&#13;
                     cent between 1995 and 2009. Land under cereal production decreased&#13;
                     by 18 percent while cereal yield fell by 5 percent. Still food production in&#13;
                     the region was 7 percent higher than its 1990 level. Over the same pe-&#13;
                     riod, agricultural productivity (output per worker) increased by 45 percent&#13;
                     while agricultural employment fell by 29 percent. For developing countries&#13;
                     in Europe and Central Asia the challenge will be to reform and invest in&#13;
                     their agro-food sectors so that food producers and exports can expand&#13;
                     without encroaching on forests and protected areas.&#13;

                     Reduced time to export and import&#13;
                     Economies in Europe and Central Asia reduced the average time required&#13;
                     to export or to import a standard container of goods from 40 and 43 days&#13;
                     in 2005 to 30 and 32 days in 2010. Doing Business surveys measure&#13;
                     the time necessary to comply with all procedures required to export or&#13;
                     to import goods and the time needed for inland transport to or from an&#13;
                     ocean port. Georgia made the largest improvements, reducing the time to&#13;
                     export from 54 days in 2005 to 10 days 2010 and the time to import from&#13;
                     52 days to 12 days. Armenia, Serbia, and Romania also made impressive&#13;

                     import by 15 to 30 days. But the region still lags behind the Latin America&#13;

            The primary completion rate for 7
            countries-Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ethiopia, Madagascar,
            Mozambique, and Niger-more than doubled between 1991 and
            2009. Still large differences persist between rich and poor
            within countries. In some low-income countries, such as
            Benin, the completion rates for the richest quintile are 95
            percent or higher, but completion rates for the poorest
            quintile are 35 percent or less. And there is a 9 percentage
            point gap in the completion rates for boys and girls. Many
            poor people depend on biomass energy from plant materials or
            animal wastes for cooking and heating. Millions of deaths
            are caused by air pollution. Many are children in developing
            countries, who die of acute respiratory infections due to
            indoor air pollution resulting from burning fuel wood, crop
            residues, or animal dung. The economies of Sub-Saharan
            Africa are gradually shifting towards industry and services.
            Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Sub-Saharan Africa expanded
            by 4.7 percent in 2010, up from 1.7 percent in 2009. In the
            last five years Rwanda, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mali,
            ranked in the top ten of 174 of the world&#146;s countries in
            making their regulatory environment more favorable to
            business. Middle East and North Africa has made impressive
            gains in women&#146;s health and education outcomes. In 2008 the
            low-and middle income economies of Middle East and North
            Africa produced 53 percent more energy compared to their
            1990 level, but they consumed 133 percent more energy and
            energy use per capita increased by 63 percent. Economic
            growth and rising labor productivity has reduced poverty in
            South Asia, home to half the world&#146;s poor people living
            below $1.25 a day. Information and communications technology
            services dominate the service exports of South Asia like no
            other region. Latin American and the Caribbean is the most
            efficient energy user in the world, measured by the ratio of
            GDP to energy use. The rapid emergence of East Asia as the
            world&#146;s export powerhouse was complemented by surging final
            demand within the region, notably in China. Taxes fund a
            broad range of social and economic programs, national
            defense, and other purposes such as redistributing income to
            the aged and unemployed.
