MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT&#13;
Fiscal 1998 (July 1, 199 7 to June 30, 1998)&#13;
is a benchmark year in MIGA's history.&#13;
First, in September 1997, the Develop-&#13;
- t; 7 it; ll~    &gt; t   ment Committee met in Hong Kong dur-&#13;
F., X9I X  r  :             ing the Annual Meetings of the World Bank&#13;
Group and reached an agreement on the&#13;
$1 billion recapitalization package for&#13;
MIGA. The package consists of an $850&#13;
IF                   million capital increase ($150 million paid&#13;
t- \      --- .--    in cash and $700 million in callable capi-&#13;
tal) and a grant transfer of $150 million&#13;
from IBRD to MIGA. The IBRD transfer&#13;
was executed on April 9, 1998. The capi-&#13;
tal increase is subject to the approval of&#13;
the Council of Governors. The Board of&#13;
Directors formally approved the recapital-&#13;
ization package and, in April, recom-&#13;
mended the issue to the Council of Gov-&#13;
ernors for a formal vote. (The voting period&#13;
will be one year.) Although subscription&#13;
and payment may require additional time&#13;
in member countries due to national clear-&#13;
ance procedures, the capital increase will enable MIGA to continue to deliver important&#13;
services for the development of its Category II member countries. These actions repre-&#13;
sent strong support by clients and shareholders of MIGA's achievements and their recog-&#13;
nition of MIGA's importance in promoting the cause of development.&#13;
During the year MIGA's Board was also engaged in serious discussions on the policy&#13;
framework under which MIGA should operate. These discussions included disclosure&#13;
policy, environmental policy and procedures, development effectiveness, inspection poli-&#13;
cies, and workers' rights. The outcome of these discussions will be implemented in the&#13;
coming fiscal year.&#13;
Vi    MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 1998&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Important changes took place on other fronts also. MIGA changed its provisioning&#13;
methodology from premium-based to risk-based. MICA has also been successful in ex-&#13;
panding its Cooperative Underwriting Programs with private insurers. Further, the pro-&#13;
posed change in the Brokers Program is expected to have positive results in increasing&#13;
projects in IDA countries and intra-Category II investments.&#13;
MIGA's Investment Marketing Services department was evaluated by independent&#13;
consultants. The consultants' report recommended an enhancement of various initiatives&#13;
undertaken in recent years. The fiscal 1999 Budget and Three-Year Business Plan, which&#13;
was approved by the Board, reflects the results of this evaluation. In addition, IPAnet,&#13;
MIGA's website for the dissemination of investment-related information, gained inter-&#13;
national r ecognition through its selection by the Financial Times as Website of the Week&#13;
in April 1998.&#13;
Fiscal 1998 was also a year of change in MIGAs management. Mr. Roger Pruneau&#13;
replaced Mr. Leigh P. Hollywood as Vice President, Guarantees in February 1998. Mr.&#13;
Angus Scrimgeour joined MIGA as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in Sep-&#13;
tember 1997. I am scheduled to leave MIGA on July 8, 1998, when my second term&#13;
expires. Overall, this was a year of preparation for these changes.&#13;
Finally, April 1998 marked the 10th anniversary of MIGA's establishment. Management&#13;
decided to hold a series of commemorative events, including a serrinar on The Role of Politi-&#13;
cal Risk Insurance in Project Finance to be held at the Annual Meetings in Washington D.C.,&#13;
in October.&#13;
I am grateful for all the support I have received during my six-year tenure with MIGA.&#13;

RESULTS ON THE GROUND: CRESCENT GREENWOOD, LTD., PAKISTAN&#13;
In fiscal 1994 and 1995, MIGA issued&#13;
two guarantee contracts totaling $12&#13;
million covering investments by Green-&#13;
wood Mills in the construction and&#13;
operation of a fully integrated garment&#13;
production facility near Faisalabad,&#13;
Pakistan. The project was the largest for-&#13;
eign investment in Pakistan's textile sec-&#13;
tor at the time. MIGA insured the U.S.-&#13;
based company against the risks of&#13;
currency transfer, expropriation, and war&#13;

the area. They represent about 13 percent of the project's total work force. The proj-&#13;
ect has also assumed environmental leadership in its sector, including planting more&#13;
than 200,000 trees within company compounds and about 21 acres of eucalyptus in&#13;
the nearby community.&#13;
The project has also provided comprehensive social infrastructure such as a residen-&#13;
tial complex, transportation, and medical facilities to its employees. In addition, it has&#13;
built a public school in which 182 of the 325 students are from the surrounding&#13;
community. To increase attendance levels, the company subsidizes the tuition of poor&#13;
students. It has made efforts to expand the availability of electricity, improve road-&#13;
ways and sanitary conditions, and increase the supply of potable water in the local&#13;
community:&#13;
The project has expended more than $25 million on local procurement since its&#13;
operational start-up, helping to bolster upstream businesses that supply goods and&#13;
services to the mill (cotton, provisions, spare parts, transportation, and fuel). Other&#13;
individuals and companies unrelated to the project (barber shops, cleaners, local banks,&#13;
and food vendors) have benefited from the project, indirectly creating an estimated&#13;
500 new jobs.&#13;
In macroeconomic terms, the project generates significant foreign exchange and tax&#13;
revenues for the government. It has introduced modern technology and produced&#13;
higher value-added textile products. This precedent-setting project has contributed to&#13;
the country's ability to attract additional foreign investment.&#13;

MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a&#13;
member of the World Bank Group, which also includes the International Bank for Recon-&#13;
struction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the&#13;
International Development Association (IDA). MIGA's activities are closely coordinated with&#13;
and complement the overall development objectives of the other World Bank institutions.&#13;
MIGA is designed to help developing countries attract productive foreign investment by&#13;
both private investors and commercially operated public sector companies. Its facilities in-&#13;
clude guarantees or insurance against noncommercial risks and a program of advisory services&#13;
and technical assistance to support member countries' efforts to attract and retain foreign&#13;
direct investment.&#13;
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Account-&#13;
ing Standards and with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The&#13;
policy adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA having&#13;
regard to its legal requirements and to the practices of other international insurance entities.&#13;
Use of Estimates&#13;
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Accounting Stan-&#13;
dards and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires manage-&#13;
ment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial&#13;
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary of poli-&#13;
cies adopted by MIGA is provided to assist readers in the interpretation of these financial&#13;
statements.&#13;
Translation of Currencies&#13;
MIGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars solely for the&#13;
purpose of summarizing MIGA's financial position and the results of its operations for the&#13;
convenience of its members and other interested parties.&#13;
MIGA is an international organization that may conduct its operations in the currencies of&#13;
all its members. MIGA's resources are derived from its capital and retained earnings in its&#13;
members' currencies. MIGA strives to minimize exchange rate risks in a multicurrency envi-&#13;
ronment. As such, MIGA attempts to match its contingent obligations in any one currency&#13;
with assets in the same currency on a pro-rata basis.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions on a pro-rata basis to&#13;
match the currencies underlying its reserves with those of the outstanding contingencies.&#13;
The purpose of these conversions will be to minimize currency exposure that may occur&#13;
through operations. Otherwise, MIGA will not convert one currency into another except for&#13;
small amounts required to meet certain operational needs.&#13;
Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange at the end of the period.&#13;
Capital subscriptions are stated in accordance with the procedures described below. Income&#13;
and expenses are generally translated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect&#13;
during each month. Translation adjustments are charged or credited to retained earnings.&#13;

Valuation of (apital Stock&#13;
Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock&#13;
of MIGA shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the Special Drawing Right&#13;
(SDR) in terms of United States dollars for the period January 1, 1981 to June 30, 1985,&#13;
such value being equal to $1.082 for one SDR. The Convention further states that 10 per-&#13;
cent of the members' shares be paid in cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that&#13;
developing member countries may pay up to a quarter of the 10 percent in their own cur-&#13;
rencies. In addition, another 10 percent of the members' shares shall be paid in the form of&#13;
nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing promissory notes. The notes are denominated in freely&#13;
convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet MIGA's obligations. The policies&#13;
relating two translation of currencies as described above also apply to the cash and the prom-&#13;
issory notes paid in.&#13;
Investments&#13;
Managernent has both the ability and intent to hold all investments to maturity. Accordingly,&#13;
MIGA's investment holdings are carried at cost or amortized cost.&#13;
Revenue Recognition&#13;
Revenue from premium payments for direct insurance and reinsurance contracts assumed&#13;
and ceded is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the contract period. Revenue from com-&#13;
mitmeni: fees, which are fees paid by investors to reserve for a limited period of time guaran-&#13;
tee capacity for future use, is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the commitment period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
The reserve for claims provides for potential losses inherent in guarantee operations based&#13;
upon an estimation of the net present value of future premium income as compared to the&#13;
net present value of future losses related to guarantee operations. MIGA has not incurred&#13;
any losses to date and accordingly has computed expected future losses by reference to (i) the&#13;
loss experiences of other insurers engaged in similar underwriting, (ii) the composition and&#13;
volume of outstanding guarantee contracts, and (iii) the worldwide economic and political&#13;
environment. This reserve is available to absorb future losses related to outstanding guaran-&#13;
tees and is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by claims settlements.&#13;
During the period ended June 30, 1997, MIGA utilized the net premium accumulation&#13;
method of provisioning. The principal feature of this methodology is that general reserves&#13;
are accu mulated annually for each contract until expiry or cancellation. The rate of accumu-&#13;
lation was set annually at the level that was estimated to be sufficient to pay claims in&#13;
aggregate during the period ending on the expiry date of the last expiring contract.&#13;
Against the background of the increased complexity and continuing growth of its portfolio,&#13;
MIGA has decided that fiscal 1998 would be an appropriate time to move to a risk based&#13;
provisicning methodology (see Note E).&#13;
The level of provision in fiscal 1998 and prior years has been based on management's evalua-&#13;
tion of potential losses that may result from (i) risks that are inherent but unidentifiable at the&#13;
time of reporting; (ii) unusually large concentrations of exposure to individual risks, countries,&#13;
or guarantee contracts; and (iii) an ongoing assessment of MIGA's expected recovery rates.&#13;
Unlike the net premium accumulation basis of provisioning, however, the new methodology&#13;
establishes sufficient general claims reserves at the end of each year to cover all of the esti-&#13;
mated fature losses arising from contracts outstanding at that time on a net present value basis;&#13;
future provisions are then established to reflect changes in MIGA's outstanding portfolio.&#13;

MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY&#13;
Notes to FiInancial Statements&#13;
As recommended by the Development Committee during the 1998 Annual Meeting, MIGA's&#13;
capital stock is expected to be increased by $850,000,000, of which $150,000,000 will be&#13;
paid in cash and $700,000,000 will be callable capital. The balance of the package was a&#13;
grant of $150,000,000 made by the World Bank. The grant was accepted by the MIGA&#13;
Board of Directors on April 18, 1998. The grant is accounted for as income and is a part of&#13;
MIGAs; reserves; as such, it is available to pay claims and is included in the calculation of&#13;
MIGA's risk-to-assets ratio. On March 31, 1998, the MIGA Board of Directors submitted a&#13;
proposal to the Council of Governors that the capital stock of MIGA shall be increased by&#13;
SDR 785,590,000, divided into 78,559 shares, each having a par value of SDR 10,000. All&#13;
payment obligations shall be settled on the basis of the value of the SDR in terms of United&#13;
States collars at the rate of $1 082 for one SDR.&#13;
NOTE C: GUAIANTEE PROGRAM AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES&#13;
Guarantee Prograrn. MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by noncom-&#13;
mercial risks (political risk insurance) to eligible investors on qualified investments in devel-&#13;
oping member countries. MIGA insures investments for up to 20 years against four different&#13;
categories of risk: currency transfer, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of&#13;
contract. Currency transfer protects the investor from inconvertibility of local currency re-&#13;
turns and proceeds from the liquidation of the investment project into foreign exchange for&#13;
transfer outside the host country. Expropriation protects the investor against partial or total&#13;
loss of the insured investment as a result of acts by the host government that may reduce or&#13;
eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured investment. War and civil dis-&#13;
turbance protects the investor against losses from damage to, or the destruction or disappear-&#13;
ance of, tangible assets caused by politically motivated acts of war or civil disturbance in the&#13;
host country. Breach of contract protects the investor against the impossibility to obtain or&#13;
to enforce an arbitral or judicial decision recognizing the breach of an obligation by the host&#13;
government. Investors may insure projects for any combination of the four types of coverage.&#13;
MIGA guarantees, other than those issued as reinsurance, cannot be terminated unilaterally&#13;
by the guarantee holder within the first three years from the date of issuance. Premium rates&#13;
applicable to issued contracts are fixed for five years. Payments against all claims under a&#13;
guarantee may not exceed the maximum amount of coverage issued under the guarantee.&#13;
As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the maximum aggre-&#13;
gate amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by MIGA is 350 percent of the&#13;
sum of MIGA's unimpaired subscribed capital and its reserves plus such portion of the insur-&#13;
ance ceded by MIGA through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of Directors may deter-&#13;
mine. Accordingly, at June 30,1998, the maximum level of guarantees outstanding may not&#13;
exceed $5,214,527,000.&#13;
Contingent Liability. The maximum amount of contingent liability of MIGA under guaran-&#13;
tees issued and outstanding at June 30, 1998 totaled $2,861,793,000 ($2,498,863,000 -&#13;
June 3(0, 1997). The maximum amount of contingent liability is MIGA's maximum expo-&#13;
sure to insurance claims, which includes "standby" coverage for which MIGA is committed&#13;
but not currently at risk. At June 30, 1998, MIGA's estimate of its actual exposure to insur-&#13;
ance claims exclusive of standby coverage is $1,678,540,000 ($1,634,664,000 - June 30,&#13;
1997). At June 30, 1998, approximately 57 percent of the contingent liability represents&#13;
guarantees issued that will expire on or after June 30, 2008.&#13;
The composition of the contingent liability including "current" and "standby" coverage under&#13;
guarantees issued and outstanding by host country and by guarantee currency is summarized&#13;

NOTE E: RESERVE FOR CLAIMS&#13;
In fiscal 1998, MIGA changed the basis for establishing reserve for claims by adopting a risk&#13;
based methodology in place of the former net premium income accumulation methodologies.&#13;
On the basis of the new risk based methodology, MIGA's reserve for claims as of June 30,&#13;
1998 amounted to $220,000,000 and, accordingly, a provision of $165,152,000 after trans-&#13;
lation adjustments was charged to the income account. The magnitude of the provision&#13;
reflects the change in methodology rather than any significant change in the underlying&#13;
quality of MIGA's portfolio. If the risk based methodology had been used for fiscal 1997,&#13;
the reserve for claims as at June 30, 1997 would have been $196,000,000 as compared to&#13;
$55,192,000 under the net premium accumulation methodology.&#13;

NOTE F: ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES&#13;
Administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1998 and June 30, 1997 con-&#13;
sisted of the following components (in thousands of U.S. dollars):&#13;
1998            1997&#13;
Administrative expenses         $  12,188        $ 12,086&#13;
Pension contribution                    -            (757)&#13;
Total                           $ 12,188         $ 11,329&#13;
The IBRD charges MIGA an annual Service and Support Fee which, for the fiscal year ended&#13;
June 30, 1998, amounted to $740,000 ($717,000 - June 30, 1997).&#13;
NOTE G: STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN&#13;
The World Bank Group has a defined benefit retirement plan (Plan) covering substantially&#13;
all of MIGA's staff. The Plan also covers substantially all the staff of IBRD and IFC. Under&#13;
the Plan, benefits are based on the years of contributory service and the highest three-year&#13;
average of pensionable remuneration as defined in the Plan, with the staff contributing a&#13;
fixed percentage of pensionable remuneration and the World Bank Group contributing the&#13;
remainder of the actuarially determined cost of future Plan benefits. The actuarial present&#13;
values of Plan obligations throughout the fiscal year are determined at the beginning of the&#13;
fiscal year by the Plan's actuary. MIGA's total contribution to the plan is based on the aggre-&#13;
gate funding method. All contributions to the Plan and all other assets and income held for&#13;
the purposes of the Plan are held separately from the other assets and income of the World&#13;
Bank Group and can be used only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their&#13;
beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid or provided for. Plan assets consist&#13;
primarily of equity and fixed income securities, with small holdings of cash, real estate, and&#13;
other investments.&#13;
As a result of the reevaluation of the economic assumptions underlying the World Bank&#13;
Group's pension expense methodology during fiscal 1997 and changes in the Staff Retire-&#13;
ment Plan assets at their fair value, MIGA recorded a pension income of $2,698,000 for the&#13;
fiscal year ended June 30, 1998 ($940,000 - June 30, 1997).&#13;
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, there were no cash contributions made to the Plan&#13;
by the World Bank Group. For the year ended June 30, 1997, the World Bank Group's cash&#13;
contribution for all participants in the Plan was $94 million, of which $757,000 was attrib-&#13;
utable to MIGA and is included in the prepaid pension cost of $1.7 million at June 30,1997.&#13;
Effective July 1, 1997, management fees incurred in respect of the Plan will be charged&#13;
against the respective Plan assets. Management fees paid to IBRD in respect of the Plan for&#13;
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 were $271,000.&#13;
NOTE H: RETIRED STAFF BENEFITS PLAN&#13;
IBRD provides other postretirement benefits for eligible active and retiredWorld Bank Group&#13;
staff, including MIGA. These benefits can be grouped under two major types-health care&#13;
and life insurance benefit and the pensions administered outside of the Staff Retirement&#13;
Plan (discussed in Note G). IBRD has designated assets to fund these liabilities.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, the World Bank Group reviewed the status of&#13;
the postretirement benefits and determined that the net assets and liabilities did not qualify&#13;
for off-balance-sheet accounting. Consequently, at June 30, 1998, the assets and liabilities&#13;
were recorded on IBRD's balance sheet.&#13;
MIGA has included a receivable from IBRD in Other Assets relating to its share of these&#13;
postretirement benefits net assets. This resulted in MIGA recognizing $1,852,000 of income&#13;
in the fiscal year ended June 30,1998, of which $1,212,000 related to periods ended June 30,&#13;
1997 and has been included in Increase in Share of Net Assets held for Postretirement&#13;
Benefits i.n the Income Statement. The receivable from IBRD totaled $2,001,000 at June 30,&#13;
1998.&#13;
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, IBRD reduced the health care cost rates used in&#13;
calculating the funded status of these benefits plans at June 30, 1998 after completing a five-&#13;
year-experience study, which resulted in a reduced accrued liability of the plans at June 30,&#13;
1998. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, MIGAs allocation of the reduction in accrued&#13;
liability was $529,000, which was also included in Increase in Share of Net Assets held for&#13;
Postretirement Benefits in the Income Statement.&#13;
NOTE i: ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES&#13;
The estirnated fair values of MIGA's cash and nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing demand&#13;
obligations are assumed to approximate their carrying values. The estimated fair value of&#13;
MIGA's investments shown in Note B is based on market quotations. The estimated fair&#13;
values are only indicative of individual financial instruments' values and should not be con-&#13;
sidered an indication of MIGA's fair value.&#13;

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of the Multilateral Investment Guar-&#13;
antee Agency, including the statement of subscriptions to capital stock and voting power,&#13;
as of June 30, 1998, and the related statements of income and cash flows for the year&#13;
then ended. These financial statements are included in the annual report on pages 40&#13;
to 53. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Multilateral Investment&#13;
Guarantee Agency's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these&#13;
financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of the Multilateral In-&#13;
vestment Guarantee Agency for the year ended June 30, 1997 were audited by other&#13;
auditors whose report, dated July 28, 1997 expressed an unqualified opinion on those&#13;
statements and included an explanatory paragraph that described the methodology used&#13;
in 1997 for determining the reserve for claims as discussed in the Notes to the financial&#13;
statements.&#13;
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and&#13;
generally accepted auditing standards in the United States of America. Those standards&#13;
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether&#13;
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,&#13;
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial state-&#13;
ments. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant&#13;
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the finan-&#13;
cial position of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency as of June 30, 1998 and&#13;
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with&#13;
International Accounting Standards and generally accepted accounting principles in the&#13;
United States of America.&#13;

tries and transition economies, involving investors from 29 member countries. A measure of MIGA's&#13;

V. GUARANTEE PORTFOLIO OUTSTANDING BY HOST REGION&#13;
(A) Gross Exposure&#13;
MIGA's guarantee portfolio has increased from $745 million in fiscal 1993 to $2.9 billion in fiscal&#13;
1998. In close correlation with the overall global foreign direct investment flows, Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean accounts for the largest share of the portfolio, and Asia witnessed a drop in its&#13;
share from previous levels.&#13;

(B) Number of Contracts Issued&#13;
The proportion of MIGA contracts issued for investments in Latin America and the Caribbean&#13;
partially reflects the more complex infrastructure and power projects covered by MIGA involving&#13;
multiple equity investors and commercial banks. In Africa and Asia, MIGA insures mainlv small&#13;
and medium-size agribusiness, manufacturing, and telecommunications investmoents.&#13;

Internet-based tools for use by its member countries: IPAizet, an on-line information clearinghouse&#13;
for FDI-related information, and PrivatizationLink, a specialized window within IPAoiet that focuses&#13;
on privatization issues and opportunities.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This is Multilateral Investment
            Guarantee Agency (MIGAs) Annual Report for FY1998. MIGAs
            10th anniversary is yet another successful year. The report
            discusses the following topical highlights: Country
            Memberships; Guarantee Operations; Financial; Technical
            Assistance Services. Fiscal year 1998 was a year of
            innovation and change for the guarantee program. Management
            developed a new range of products and services and discussed
            key policies to enhance the developmental benefits of
            MIGA-insured investments. MIGA issued 55 guarantee contracts
            during the year, totaling $830.9 million in coverage. .
            These investments benefit 26 developing countries, of which
            10 countries have received MIGA-insured investments for the
            first time. MIGA's first guarantees in 10 new
            countries, namely, Angola, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Dominican
            Republic, Equatorial Guinea, India, Kenya, Mozambique,
            Ukraine, and Uruguay. The growth of foreign direct
            investment in developing countries acted as a catalyst for,
            and benefited from, the expansion of the investment
            insurance market. Concerns of project sponsors about
            restrictions on transfer of remittances, expropriation or
            nationalization, and war and civil disturbance have
            inhibited the flow of foreign investments in the past. The
            increasing availability and use of political risk insurance
            as a risk-mitigating mechanism have boosted investors
            confidence to invest in developing countries. MIGA has taken
            advantage of the recent changes in the investment insurance
            market to extend its efforts to promote developmentally
            sound projects and to catalyze private capital flows to its
            developing member countries.
