        <abstracts>
            Money markets trade in debt--unsecured
            overnight loans, commercial bills, treasury bills, and
            repurchase agreements--of less than a year to maturity.  To
            work efficiently, these basic building blocks in the
            development of capital markets need liquidity, multilateral
            trading, and a range of participants.  This Note describes
            the features of a liquid and efficient money market and the
            benefits it brings to banks, savers, borrowers, other
            financial markets, the government, and the central bank.
            Efficient money markets need the right incentives for
            participation and an adequate infrastructure for fast, safe,
            and easy transactions.  This Note outlines the important
            steps in creating the right incentive structure.  It
            identifies the key parts of infrastructure for an interbank,
            a primary bill, and a secondary bill market, and the
            components of the infrastructure specific to creating
            primary and secondary bill markets. A separate box in the
            Note provides a general picture of sequencing in the
            development of a money market.
