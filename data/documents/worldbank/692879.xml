STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. The Economy&#13;
1.01   Morocco emerged from an economic and financial crisis in the early 1980s to a relatively stable&#13;
macroeconomic environment in the early 1990s. A steady pursuit of stringent monetary and fiscal policies&#13;
reduced the budget deficit from an average of 12% of GDP in 1980-83 to 3.3% in 1993; inflation has been&#13;
kept within single digits; and the foreign debt situation improved through greater mobilization of domestic&#13;
resources and external debt rescheduling. Stabilization and structural reforms have resulted in a shift from&#13;
Government-administered to market-determined pricing in finance and trade areas. These reforms have&#13;
brought about significant improvements in the balance of payments: current account deficits declined&#13;
steadily from 12% of GDP at the height of the economic crisis in 1983 to about 2% in the early 1990s.&#13;
Although average GDP growth was relatively modest between 1986 and 1994, 3.3% on average, Morocco&#13;
will aim for a double-digit growth of private industrial output. This would be achieved mainly through a&#13;
rapid growth of exports to the European Union (EU), with which Morocco has signed a free trade&#13;
agreement to be implemented over the next decade.&#13;
1.02   In recent years, however, Morocco has begun to show many signs of social and economic&#13;
fragilities. Key social indicators such as literacy, primary school enrollment rates, nutritional status and&#13;
access to safe water are still significantly lower than countries at a comparable stage of development, and&#13;
are characterized by persistent regional and gender differences. Economic indicators show that gross&#13;
investment levels have declined by four to five percentage points of GDP, urban unemployment rose to&#13;
16% and, in the past three years, the budget deficit approached 5% of GDP. Export of manufactured&#13;
goods declined by 4% in the 1992-93 period, after a growth of more than 10% per annum on average&#13;
between 1985 and 1992, resulting in a significant loss of EU market shares.&#13;
1.03   This deterioration in economic performance is associated not only with external and exogenous&#13;
factors, such as recent droughts and recession in the EU, but also with deteriorating competitiveness.&#13;
Moroccan enterprises are inadequately prepared to counterbalance both the erosion of their preferential&#13;
access to the EU market and the increased competition from low-wage countries. They have been unable to&#13;
quickly modernize their technologies and production processes, to diversify their production by shifting to&#13;
higher quality and value-added products, and to increase the skill requirements of their jobs. Productivity,&#13;
measured in value added by workers, is generally low, and has even been declining in the textile and&#13;
garment industries', a major exporting sector. As a result, Morocco lost shares in the EU market to Asian&#13;
competitors such as China, Indonesia and India, which achieved rapid gains in penetration, or Turkey,&#13;
which consolidated its strong export performance, and Poland and the Czeck Republic, which emerged as&#13;
new competitors.&#13;
The productivity decline is most apparent in the Textile, Garment and Leather industries. Between 1985 and 1990, productivity (measured by&#13;
the real value-added per worker) declined by 6% for Morocco, while it increased by 30% for Turkey, 38% for Malaysia, and 52% for&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.04   Recent economic trends were reflected in the labor market by a marked increase in unemploymnent&#13;
rates. The size of the Moroccan labor force is 8.9 million, of which 4.3 million live in urban areas where&#13;
unemployment has reached 16% and affects the youth in particular. In rural areas, unemployment is lower,&#13;
at around 10%, but important migration flows to large cities evidence the existence of substantial&#13;
underemployment. The increase in unemployment in urban areas results primarily from low levels of labor&#13;
demand and rapid expansion of the labor force. The urban labor force has been growing at a rate of almost&#13;
4% a year, driven by a population growth rate of 2.1%, and migration from rural areas as well as&#13;
increasing participation rates. While a more flexible labor market regulatory system2 would significantly&#13;
promote employment creation, it is estimated that only an acceleration of economic growth to 6-7% per&#13;
annum would create enough jobs to reduce urban unemployment to around 10%.&#13;

B. The Demand for Skilled Labor&#13;
1.05    Enterprises' lack of demand for skilled labor (and its correlate the soaring unemployment among&#13;
the educated) are major characteristics of the Moroccan economy and a cause of great concern to the&#13;
Government. Except for the graduates of the few elite schools that have restricted access quotas, higher,&#13;
secondary (baccalaureate) and vocational education graduates have experienced record high unemployment&#13;
2&#13;
Three aspects of Moroccan labor regulations are thought to be hindering employment promotion: (a) minimum wage policies, (b) mandated&#13;
non-wage labor costs, and (c) regulations governing hiring and dismissal (see World Bank report No. 14155 MOR for more details.) A new&#13;
labor code dealing with these issues is being prepared by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
rates in recent years, around 30%. At the opposite end of the skills spectrum, unemployment rate is only&#13;
10% among the labor force participants with less than primary education, slightly lower than in 1986 when&#13;
it was 13%. This reflects the expansion of low skill and low productivity employment generated by small-&#13;
and micro-enterprises, which have a low level of capitalization, use traditional production processes, or&#13;
which operate in the informal sector. While tis expansion is thought to have helped reduce poverty, in the&#13;
long run it is likely to induce a further decline in the enterprises' ability to compete in international markets&#13;
where Morocco's competitors are achieving rapid productivity gains.&#13;
1.06    In addition to their lack of demand for skilled labor, enterprises are reluctant to retrain their&#13;
workers. The 1986 Moroccan Industrial Survey asked enterprises whether or not they trained their&#13;
workers, the numbers of people trained, and how much they spent on training3.  Only 195 of the 4,354&#13;
firms surveyed engaged in any formal training; an incidence of 4.5%. While this incidence compares&#13;
unfavorably with countries such as Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mexico (see Table 2) the pattern of&#13;
training is similar: micro-enterprises are the least likely, and large firms are the most likely to train.&#13;

World Bank staff estimates&#13;
1.07    Enterprises' failure to hire skilled workers, and especially to retrain, results in a substantial loss of&#13;
productivity and income for workers. Training enterprises- outperform non-training ones in many ways:&#13;
they are larger in terms of output and value added, export more and are much more likely to survive. A&#13;
comparison between 1986 and 1993 Industrial Surveys demonstrates that 9 out of 10 firms which trained&#13;
in 1986 were still operating 7 years later, compared with 3 out of 4 nontraining firms. Controlling for other&#13;
observable factors, the productivity of training enterprises is 37.1%  higher and their workers tend to earn&#13;
28% more than in enterprises which do not train [see economic analysis im para. 3.08 and Annex 4]. These&#13;
results suggest that short, flexible and company-specific in-service training is a major instrument to build&#13;
enterprises' competencies. In fact, although many Moroccan enterprises and particularly the micro- and&#13;
small-sized industries (MSIs) do not always require a high proportion of technicians, nonetheless, product&#13;
quality, and adaptability to changing client requirements, are critical and will determine their&#13;
competitiveness4. If they are to remain competitive, they need to adapt and reinforce their competencies in&#13;
This survey is the only one of its kind that asked such questions. The low incidence of training among finns has been evidenced by another&#13;
survey conducted among 300 enterprises in 1994 by the Association des Gestionnaires et Formnateurs de Personnel (AGEF, Casablanca&#13;
1994.)&#13;
4&#13;
The private sector is predominantly made of micro-less than 15 employees-and small indusgries (between 15 and 100 employees), which&#13;
represent 49% and 39% of the total number of fums respectively. The recent development of temporary employment suggests that, even when&#13;
export-oriented, their strategy is to obtain profit through cost compression rather than technological superiority. The garment industry is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
a broad range of technical occupations, as well as in basic management techniques, product standards&#13;
(norms, packaging, conditioning...), quality management, and even in remedial training in basic education,&#13;
foreign languages, attitudes and communication skills.&#13;
1.08    Moroccan enterprises' failure to retrain is related to two main reasons. First, MSIs, which are&#13;
predominant, rarely retrain their workers because they are less likely than large firms to access information&#13;
on training. As a result, they are either unaware of the productivity-enhancing effect of training or do not&#13;
know how to train5. Their professional associations (PA), which in other countries provide assistance in&#13;
defining and implementing sector training strategies, have just started to develop and gain representativity6.&#13;
Second, many enterprises claim that they cannot afford to retrain their workers. Since 1974, Morocco has&#13;
a Vocational Training Tax (VTT), which is a 1.6% levy on total payroll earmarked to one public training&#13;
agency, the Office de la Formation Professionnelle et de la Promotion du Travail (OFPPT.) Payroll&#13;
levies have proved to be most successful in middle-income countries in the initial stages of developing&#13;
enterprise-based training by providing an effective incentive to avoid sub-optimal provision of training.&#13;
Moreover, payroll levies put little burden on scarce budgetary resources. In Morocco, however, the&#13;
earmarking of this tax to a single public training provider is a source of inefficiency, and inhibits in-service&#13;
training among enterprises by inducing a mentality of delegating responsibility to OFPPT, and reducing the&#13;
willingness of industry to take responsibility of its own vocational training initiatives. Another reason for&#13;
not training is that there are economies of scale in training, and small enterprises which only want to train&#13;
one or two workers find the cost too high.&#13;
C. The Supply of Skilled Labor&#13;
1.09    After independence, the Government of Morocco made a strong commitment to improve the&#13;
education of the population. The main characteristics of the education and training sector are: (i) public&#13;
provision through a highly centralized system; (ii) free access to all levels of public education; and (iii) high&#13;
budget outlays, by international standards. Private provision of education is essentially an urban&#13;
phenomenon addressing the needs of the well-off population. It is therefore small, except in vocational&#13;
education where it represents almost half the total enrollment. While significant progress has been achieved&#13;
since independence, enrollment levels remains insufficient by middle-income countries' standards, as&#13;
suggested by in the labor force's low level of educational attainment and the excessive number of dropouts&#13;
from basic and secondary education.&#13;
1.10    The vocational training sector, with an enrollment of 120,000, represents one fourth of the total&#13;
secondary education enrollment, and is the main source of skilled-worker training and retraining. Since the&#13;
skilled-worker requirements of enterprises and their demand for customized training have been weak,&#13;
training providers have tailored their services to the demand for pre-employment training of the large&#13;
cohorts of out-of-school and unemployed youth. Training programs are mainly center-based and targeted&#13;
toward urban formal sector jobs. Both public and private institutions have been successful in attracting&#13;
typical example, squeezed between the higher technological levels and labor efficiency of Europe, and the lower labor cost of some of the newly&#13;
industrialized countries.&#13;
For a broader discussion of the determinants of training in a number of developing countries see Enterprises Training in Developing Countries,&#13;

The conclusions of a Bank managed study of the PAs point out that while aware of what is at stake, the PAs have very limited operational&#13;
capacities, their functioning lacks transparency, and they have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

their target clientele. The private training institutions have seen a very fast growth; their capacity has&#13;
increased fourfold during the last decade, reaching 40,000 students in 1995. The training capacity of the&#13;
OFPPT has grown from 20,000 students in 1984 to 44,000 in 1995.&#13;
1.11    Although the existence of a large informal sector distorts the results of the labor market surveys&#13;
and may exaggerate the unemployment rate for vocational training graduates, there is ample evidence from&#13;
various sources that those graduates are increasingly facing insertion difficulties. Tracer studies carried out&#13;
by the Ministry of Vocational Training (MVT) indicate that about 50% of the graduates --whether from&#13;
public or private institutions-- remain unemployed nine months after graduation and that this search period&#13;
is getting longer7. Other surveys carried out by the Conseil National Jeunesse et Avenir (CNJA), an&#13;
independent think-tank, suggest that unemployment rates of VT graduates are actually lower than indicated&#13;
by the labor market surveys, but confirm that they have a search period much longer than for the average&#13;
job seeker. They also suggest that VT graduates have high expectations when they start looking for a job&#13;
but after they get a more realistic perception of the labor market, they lower their expectations, or accept&#13;
jobs unrelated to their initial skills. While these surveys do not show significant mismatches between&#13;
demand and supply of skills, their findings indicate that the number of graduates exceeds the current&#13;
enterprises' absorption capacity, and that any further capacity expansion will be economically inefficient.&#13;
1.12    The private training sector. The national training policy has been to provide neither incentives nor&#13;
barriers to the development of the private training sector (proprietary institutions) beyond basic safety&#13;
regulations enforced by the municipalities. There is no formal accreditation system nor information on&#13;
curricula. There are about 800 private training schools, all are profit-seeking, operate in service-oriented&#13;
trades, and focus on pre-service training. The Government objective is to entice the private training sector&#13;
to expand further and invest in technology-oriented vocational schools, which require heavier capital&#13;
investments. But this is unlikely to occur without significant resource transfers from the State to these&#13;
proprietary institutions because the potential for full cost recovery is low. Among students reaching upper&#13;
basic education, those oriented to pre-service VT demonstrate lower academic achievement than those&#13;
oriented to general secondary. Such lower achievement is correlated with lower socio-economic status,&#13;
suggesting that VT students come disproportionately from poorer families.&#13;
1.13    The OFPPT. Besides its graduates' insertion difficulties, OFPPT lacks a long-term  vision and is&#13;
hampered by a centralized and rigid structure.  OFPPT is a well-financed Government agency under the&#13;
aegis of the MVT, with a tripartite --Government, enterprises and labor-- Goveming Board. A majority of&#13;
its operating funds come from the VTT, which is considered by the enterprises as a private source,. Its&#13;
training strategies have mainly served the Government's social priorities but in recent years there has been&#13;
a shift in those strategies --away from the objective of expanding capacity toward addressing the training&#13;
requirements of employers-- through the implementation of a two-pronged approach aimed at:&#13;
These estimates are to be used with caution since the design of the survey gives incentives for those unhappy about their employment to declare&#13;
themselves unemployed, hoping that this would help them find a job in accordance with their expectations. Private sector graduates have a&#13;
slightly higher insertion rate than public sector graduates (58% remain unemployed nine months after graduation against 60%). However, their&#13;
difference is also to be interpreted with caution because the graduates of the private sector live in urban areas, are employed mainly in the&#13;
commerce and trade sectors and, in particular, come from the well-offsocial group.&#13;
The Govemment contribution to the operating expenditures of OFPPT represent s 0.3% of total Government consumption (total Government&#13;
operating expenditures less debt service and transfers) and 0.8% of its capital expenditures. For comparison purposes, the Ministry of&#13;
Education's budget represents 3 5 % of Government consumption and 10% of its capital expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
(a)  creating links with enterprises at the training center level. This is being achieved by, first,&#13;
the creation of a steering committee within each center, which includes a majority of private&#13;
sector representatives and has a consultative role on training programs, curricula, and&#13;
examinations, and second, by diversifying the number of training streams to cover a larger&#13;
spectrum of enterprise-specific skill needs (in 1994 the number of streams reached 130); and&#13;
(b)  introducing more flexibility in the use of the VTT. A scheme that partially reimburses&#13;
enterprises that carry out in-service training activities, the Contrats Speciaux de Formation&#13;
(CSF) was introduced to provide incentives for enterprises to retrain their workers. While&#13;
implemented through OFPPT's administration, the CSF is independently managed by a&#13;
private-public committee selected from, and supervised by, OFPPT's Board.&#13;
1.14   There is a consensus among OFPPT's board that these strategic options are right. However, both&#13;
the enterprises' and government representatives are concerned about the poor results on the ground and&#13;
acknowledge that a major upgrading of OFPPT centers' govemance, curricula, and technological&#13;
equipment is necessary to make them more responsive to enterprise training requirements. The involvement&#13;
of employers at the level of the centers has been constrained primarily by the centers' lack of managerial&#13;
capacity, insufficient autonomy, as well as inadequate incentives for staff. The increase in the number of&#13;
streams has led to excessive specialization of the graduates. This turned out to be a disadvantage on the&#13;
labor market, as well as too costly to implement because technology is increasingly complex, and the&#13;
training needs of the enterprises are rapidly changing.  Moreover, replacement of obsolete training&#13;
equipment has been insufficient as a consequence of the heavy investments in capacity expansion of the late&#13;
1980s&#13;
1.15   Finally, little has been achieved in terms of creating a balance between pre-employment training&#13;
and upgrading of the existing labor force. The development -of the CSF scheme was hampered by lack of&#13;
funds (3% of the OFPPT budget in 1994) in comparison with the allocation to the pre-service training&#13;
activities, low ceilings on the cumulative amount that can be reimbursed annually to a given enterprise, and&#13;
a centralized operational structure. More importantly, the development of the CSF scheme presents risks to&#13;
OFPPT's financial stability. Since the CSF is funded by the VTT, and the VTT is earmarked to finance&#13;
OFPPT, the reimbursements made by the CSF to the enterprises are in fact deducted from OFPPT's&#13;
budget.&#13;

D. Government Strategy&#13;
1.16    The Govermment of Morocco is committed to transform  its training system  into an effective&#13;
instrument to promote labor productivity, especially for smaller enterprises. This would help foster labor&#13;
demand, alleviate poverty and contribute to the development of the private sector. This would be achieved&#13;
when most vocational training is planned, delivered and financed by employers.&#13;
1.17    Shifting responsibility and resources for training to the private sector requires a realistic and&#13;
gradual reform process. Private enterprises have not yet demonstrated a very active involvement in training&#13;
and the proprietary institutions are unlikely to diversify into technology-oriented trades. Moreover, an&#13;
effective public training system is still necessary because the public programs are, at the moment, the only&#13;
providers of technical training, and because they usually provide the basic skills on which further job-&#13;
specific training can be structured. Finally, more radical reforms of the training system depend on broader&#13;
reforms of the funding and governance of the education and training systems. Although there is&#13;
commitment at the highest level of the State to eliminate the principle of "free of charge" education and&#13;
training (which would provide a strong incentive to the private training sector), the Government is&#13;
proceeding carefully in order to build political consensus and, in the medium-term, only limited cost&#13;
recovery can be envisioned9.&#13;
1.18    Within this political framework, the MVT has made the development of in-service training its&#13;
priority in order to respond to the urgent need to upgrade the existing labor force, expand the resources&#13;
available for skill development and, since in-service training is less politically sensitive than other forms of&#13;
training, experiment and demonstrate a number of innovative and demand-oriented policies. These policies&#13;
are to:&#13;
9&#13;
King Hassan II has made public these orientations in a number of speeches. In 1994, he initiated a parliamentary debate on education to&#13;
address the problems in a more comprehensive manner. This debate was soon suspended as it was deemed inconclusive and too&#13;
politicized. More recently, in October 1995, a policy note on education and training prepared by the Bank at his request was widely&#13;
disseminated, and gave rise to a national debate in the media.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
(a)   integrate training as an important component of enterprise development strategies by&#13;
stressing the importance of identifying competency needs, retraining of workers, and&#13;
pooling training resources to realize economies of scale;&#13;
(b)    increase the resources allocated to in-service training, with special emphasis on MSIs.&#13;
As in-service training is provided through a market-oriented framework, this would&#13;
promote competition among training institutions and boost the private training sector;&#13;
(c)    initiate further reforms of the VTT by clarifying operational and financial roles with&#13;
regards to in-service training, and by reinforcing tripartite management (enterprises,&#13;
labor and Government). A law would be promulgated to that effect (see para. 2.05);&#13;
(d)    reinforce the responsiveness of the public training system and promote the emergence of a&#13;
greater diversity of training providers. In January 1996, the Ministries of Finance and&#13;
Vocational Training issued a joint decree [Section 2.15 of Implementation Volume] which&#13;
substantially increases the autonomy of OFPPT's centers and provides a regulatory&#13;
framework for the centers and their staff to supplement their resources with the proceeds&#13;
of training contracts negotiated with enterprises. In the medium-term, those public centers&#13;
which would achieve a strong commercial orientation, high level of managerial and&#13;
financial autonomy, and links with enterprises, could be "transferred" to the private sector&#13;
through a variety of formulas, such as the private concessions which are being cautiously&#13;
explored by the Government. A private concession, in the textile industry, has been&#13;
created and is privately managed by the corresponding Professional Association. The&#13;
majority of its investments and equipment were provided by the State, but it is facing a&#13;
number of difficulties because Morocco lacks an adequate legal framework for the transfer&#13;
of public funds to privately operated educational institutions.&#13;
E. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.19  In June 1994, the Government set up an advisory committee composed of policy makers, private&#13;
sector leaders, and the Bank, with a mandate to prepare an agenda for Private Sector Development (PSD).&#13;
This agenda defines four main axes of action: (i) to establish a market-based financial system and develop&#13;
capital markets; (ii) to promote private sector participation in the development of basic infrastructure and&#13;
services; (iii) to improve the skills of the labor force and remove restrictions on the labor market; and (iv)&#13;
to enhance the competitiveness of the private sector in anticipation of the Free Trade Agreement with the&#13;
EU.&#13;
1.20   In response, the Bank set up a program of lending and non-lending services (the PSD program)&#13;
which covers the four core areas of the Government's PSD agenda. Bank intervention in vocational&#13;
training is therefore an integral part of the Bank's PSD program, and one of the pillars of our country&#13;
assistance strategy. It would contribute to:&#13;
(a)    create a synergy between several components of the program. The PSD prograrn includes&#13;
components which aim at inducing enterprises in acquiring new technologies and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
modemizing their manufacturing processes'0. In-service training is an integral part of this&#13;
program because the low-skilled workforce would not be able to adopt these new&#13;
technologies. Conversely, this training project would rely on other components of the&#13;
program to identify the enterprises and sectors in which training should be developed on a&#13;
priority basis for competitiveness considerations;&#13;
(b)     provide the necessary catalysis between the Govemment, the private sector and bilateral&#13;
donors, particularly the EU, to build support for further reforms of the vocational training&#13;
sector; and&#13;
(c)     provide the expertise needed for institutional development, particularly for the formulation&#13;
of training policies and the analyses of the impact of training on enterprise&#13;
competitiveness.&#13;
1.21    In addition, the policy framework proposed by the Govemment is consistent with the Bank's&#13;
objectives for the sector, although less ambitious in its timing than what the Bank would recommend. The&#13;
Moroccan economy is not sufficiently advanced so that total deregulation of VT financing and delivery&#13;
could be envisaged without risking to depress growth through shortage of skills. What the Bank has been&#13;
recommending is that the contribution to the public training sector through the VTT and State budget be&#13;
progressively reduced and replaced by an altemative demand-driven financing scheme, such as a tax rebate&#13;
scheme or a training fund. Such a scheme would curb the expansion of pre-service training provision in&#13;
line with labor market demand, and leave the public sector with no alternative than to sell training services&#13;
on the market, which would assure that training programs are responsive to enterprise needs. As regards&#13;
the role of the private sector, international experience suggests that different but equally valid strategies can&#13;
emerge from similar contexts depending on social and economic perceptions, as well as economic growth&#13;
patterns. Morocco's strategy seeks to strike a balance between the educational demand of a rapidly&#13;
growing youth population and economic efficiency by promoting the emergence of comprehensive public-&#13;
private partnerships, through various financial incentives to train, and the representation of the private&#13;
sector in all institutions dealing with VT. The public-private partnership aims at achieving more efficient&#13;
training delivery modes while ensuring high participation rates and financial stability to the sector.&#13;
However, the Govemment still needs to develop a detailed action plan for its strategy, and has requested the&#13;
assistance of the Bank. The Bank has assisted with the development of a strategy formulation process (see&#13;
Annex 2) has agreed to include the cost of the necessary technical assistance among the activities to be&#13;
financed by the project, and will continue to provide its advice on sector policy issues.&#13;
10&#13;
In particular, the Industrial Infrastructure Project, which is under preparation, would promote new technologies, and would develop a new&#13;
system of standards and certification for the industiy. On the other hand, the on-going Enterprises Competitiveness Study would identify&#13;
"clusters" of competitive industries and make recommendations on strengthening their long-term viability in the context of the forlhcoming free&#13;
trade agreement with the EU. Finally, an on-going labor market study ainm at identifying key policy options that may facilitate labor&#13;
absorption. The field surveys for these studies are in progress and the first results are expected by the end of 1996.&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives &amp; Description&#13;
2.01    Objectives. The project would improve enterprise competitiveness, retraining of the work force and&#13;
upgrading of its skills. To maximize the impact of training, the project would:&#13;
(a)    strengthen the capacity of professional associations and enterprises to define the skills they&#13;
need to implement their business development strategies, with particular emphasis on&#13;
micro- and small-sized enterprises;&#13;
(b)    introduce incentives for enterprises to develop in-service training;&#13;
(c)    promote the responsiveness of selected public training centers which cater to the private&#13;
sector; and&#13;
(d)    create an adequate legal framework for the development of in-service training and&#13;
strengthen the institutional capacity of the MVT.&#13;
2.02   Description. To achieve these objectives, the project would have the following four components:&#13;
2.03   Promotion of demand for training (6% of total base costs). This component would support the&#13;
development of non-governmental inter-professional organizations (Groupements Interprofessionnels&#13;
d'Aide au Conseil, GIACs) which are being created by professional associations and federations, with the&#13;
mandate to inform enterprises on the importance of integrating in-service training as one of the key factors&#13;
to their competitiveness and to assist them in the definition of their skills needs. The project would support&#13;
the start-up and operating costs of three GIACs as well as provide them with the required technical&#13;
assistance to develop their services to enterprises. These GIACs" would have access to a scheme (Fonds&#13;
Interprofessionnel d'Aide au Conseil, FIAC) to be established under the project, which would finance a&#13;
portion of the consulting services contracted by enterprises to carry out their competency need assessments&#13;
(CNA.) The FIAC would be managed by a Demand Orientation Committee (Comite d'Orientation de la&#13;
Demande, COD) composed of representatives from the MVT, the Ministry of Finance (MF) the Ministry&#13;
of Commerce and Industry (MCI), the presidents of the GIACs, and another representative of the private&#13;
sector designated by the President of the COD. Both the GIACs and the FIAC would be subject to their&#13;
respective procedural manuals which define the conditions of their operation, the eligibility criteria to&#13;
enterprises for the resources of the FIAC, as well as the standard auditing, reporting and monitoring&#13;
requirements [see Implementation Volume Section 2.2 for these manuals, as well as for the by-laws and&#13;
operating manual of the GIACs].&#13;
2.04   It is estimated that, during the five years of the project, each GIAC would arrange for and finance&#13;
about 120 CNAs. An estimate of the GIACs' operating costs, their revenues from enterprises' membership&#13;
fees and their expenditures can be found in the Implementation Volume [Section 2.2.7]. The total cost of&#13;
One GIAC formed by FIMME, AMICA, AMGE and AMIP (Automobiles, energy and pharmaceuticals) has been created. A second&#13;
GIAC formed by AMITH and FEDIC (textile, garment and leather industries) is being created. The third GIAC is being created by&#13;
the ASMELEC, the APEBI and the AIMTEL (Electricity, Office Technologies and Telecommunications). The creation of three other&#13;
GIACs (Building Industry, Tourism, and Fisheries) is being envisaged.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
this component is estimated at US$5.4 million, 23% of which would be financed by the enterprises through&#13;
their membership fees or their direct contribution, 25%, or the start-up costs, by the Government and other&#13;
donors, and 52%, or the financing of the FIAC, by the Bank loan. Before negotiations, the Government&#13;
transmitted the decision creating the FIAC and the FIAC Procedural Manual, including monitoring and&#13;
reporting mechanisms and auditing requirements [para.5.02(a)]. Before Board Presentation: (i) the&#13;
registered statutes of one GIAC and its procedural manual approved by its Board were officially&#13;
transmitted to the Bank, and (ii) the members of the COD were appointed [para. 5.04(a) and (b)].&#13;
2.05 Development of in-service training (41% of total base cost.) This second component would&#13;
support the development of in-service training and the evolution of the training system towards a system&#13;
where employers and employees take a major role in governance, where VTT funds are mutualized (i.e. de-&#13;
linking the amount reimbursed to an enterprise from the level of its tax contribution), and managed by an&#13;
independent entity in which employers and employees are a majority. This would be realized in a two-stage&#13;
approach by initiating a reform of the existing enterprise training reimbursement scheme (Contrats&#13;
Speciaux de Formation, CSF) to test the principles described above and to rapidly promote both the&#13;
demand for and supply of in-service training and, in a second phase, formalize these principles in a Law on&#13;
In-Service training (see para. 2.09 below). To that end, a new Procedural Manual [see Implementation&#13;
Volume, Section 2.3.2] has been elaborated which provides for: (i) a decentralized management of the CSF&#13;
through regional tripartite committees (enterprises, labor and Government representatives); (ii) distinct&#13;
accounting and auditing systems for the CSF; (iii) mutualization of the funds; and (iv) new eligibility&#13;
criteria of enterprises, which favor MSIs, enterprises with an export development strategy and/or creating&#13;
employment; and enable the private proprietary training institutions selected by enterprises to carry out&#13;
their training to benefit from a larger share of the VTT. The projections of the evolution of reimbursement&#13;
of training contracts and of the amount of the VTT allocated to that activity [see Implementation Volume,&#13;
Section 1] have served as a basis to size this component.&#13;
2.06   The cost of this component is estimated at US$35.3 million, representing the total estimated value&#13;
of in-service training contracts to be partially reimbursed over the first three years of the project. Bank&#13;
financing would represent 27% of that amount and be limited to the first three years of the project, that is&#13;
prior to implementation of the new Law on in-service training. Enterprises and employees will finance the&#13;
balance through either their direct contribution or the VTT, as well as fully finance the scheme after the&#13;
phasing out of Bank financing.&#13;
2.07   Before negotiations OFPPT's Board approved the restructuring of the CSF and its new Procedural&#13;
Manual and before Board Presentation OFPPT's Board allocated an appropriate amount [as defined in the&#13;
Implementation Volume Section 2.3.2] to the CSF scheme for the first three years of the project&#13;
[para.5.04(c)].&#13;
2.08   Emergence of Centers of Excellence (51% of total base cost.) This third component would&#13;
improve the relevance of OFPPT and its responsiveness to enterprises' training needs. It will put a special&#13;
emphasis on in-service training by supporting the development of 36 of the 180 OFPPT centers into&#13;
"Centers of Excellence" [see Implementation Volume 2.4, for a detailed description of the component, the&#13;
list and classification of Centers] selected for their potential to meet, within the project life, a set of 20&#13;
criteria [Annex 6] combining student insertion performance, links with enterprises, capacity to generate&#13;
income through the provision of contractual training and counseling services to enterprises, performance in&#13;
attracting workers to evening courses, and management capacity. The project will provide incentives&#13;
(budgetary autonomy, statutory conditions for management of center and staff), the framework (creation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
a steering committee composed of enterprises within each center) as well as a series of activities aimed at&#13;
promoting their responsiveness to clients [see Implementation Volume section 2.4] and the equipment, staff&#13;
training and technical assistance needed for these centers to reach the level of excellence. The cost of this&#13;
component is US$43.7 million, 17% of which would be financed by the Bank loan and the rest by the&#13;
Government12. Bank financing would be concentrated on 17 centers and be limited to those strategic inputs&#13;
directly related to in-service training and which determine the progression of the centers to the level of&#13;
excellence, primarily technical assistance for assessment and upgrading of the competencies of the&#13;
management and teaching staff, development of the centers' capacity to design training programs that&#13;
address specific needs, for the design and development of a catalogue of evening courses, as well as the&#13;
necessary pedagogical material. Other inputs consisting in equipment necessary for the reconversion or&#13;
creation of new training streams would be financed by the Government.&#13;
2.09   Institutional Strengthening (1% of total base cost). This fourth component would strengthen the&#13;
policy formulation capacity of the MVT by supporting (i) the elaboration of a broad strategy for the&#13;
vocational training system including the roles of public and private training sectors [see terms-of-reference&#13;
in Annex 2]; (ii) the process of preparation of the Law on in-service training referred to in para. 2.05 above&#13;
which will rely on a review of international experiences, an assessment of the Moroccan situation, and in&#13;
particular the evolution of the CSF scheme after its reorganization, and a broad consultation of all parties&#13;
involved in order to formalize the reform initiated under the project and clarify financial and operational&#13;
roles; and (iii) the carrying out of a series of surveys aiming at measuring the impact of training on&#13;
enterprises' competitiveness (see Terms-of-reference in Annex 3). The cost of this component is estimated&#13;
at US$0.6 million, which would be entirely financed by the Bank loan. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government gave assurances that (a) it will prepare on the basis of process and guidelines agreed upon&#13;
with the Bank, and cause the Cabinet (Conseil du Gouvernement) to approve, not later than September 30,&#13;
1998, a draft Law that will translate Morocco's new policy orientations regarding in-service training, as&#13;
described in para. 1.18 &amp; Annex 1, and clarify financial and operational roles of the various players in the&#13;
system [para. 5.03 (a)]; and (b) its strategy on vocational training will be finalized by December 31, 1997&#13;
and implemented thereafter [para. 5.03(b)].&#13;
III. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Summary of Project Costs&#13;
3.01   Total project costs, net of taxes, are estimated at US$95.3 million equivalent, including US$10.3&#13;
million for contingencies (10%). Taxes have been estimated at US$14.3 million (12%). A summary of the&#13;
proposed project costs appears in Table 4 below.&#13;
3.02   Basis for Cost Estimates. Costs for rehabilitation, funmiture, equipment and pedagogic materials&#13;
are based on average unit costs of recently awarded contracts for similar items. Costs for computers and&#13;
software are based on international prices and include installation and user training. Costs for specialist&#13;
services include fees, travel, accommodation and subsistence and are based on recent consultant contracts.&#13;
Costs for overseas training include travel, living expenses, tuition when applicable. Detailed cost&#13;
The Governnent is actively seeking EU financing for part of this component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
assumptions for the GIACs can be found in Section 2.2.7 of the Implementation Volume. Estimates of the&#13;
evolution of demand for in-service training can be found in Section 1 of the Implementation Volume.&#13;
3.03    Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency allowance for unforeseen physical&#13;
variations applied on the third and fourth components only -- equal to US$2 million (2% of total project&#13;
cost, excluding taxes). The following rates have been applied: civil works and equipment 10%, consultant&#13;
services, training and recurrent costs 5%. Price contingencies between negotiations and project completion&#13;
are estimated at US$8.3 million (9% of total costs excluding taxes). The following annual rates of price&#13;
increases have been applied: 5.5% per year for local costs and 2.6% per year for foreign costs.&#13;
3.04    Foreign Exchange Content; The foreign exchange content is estimated as follows: rehabilitation of&#13;
training centers (40%); pedagogical material (55%); furniture (0%); technical equipment and computers&#13;
(90%); specialists and training (0%   when local, 100%  when overseas).  The resulting total foreign&#13;
exchange content is estimated at US$47.5 million, representing 50% of total project costs, excluding taxes.&#13;
3.05    Custom Duties and Taxes  Imported goods classified as educational material and equipment are&#13;
exempt from duties and taxes. Goods and services procured locallv average taxes of 15%.&#13;

Totals may not add up due to rounding up of figures&#13;
The amounts indicated do not include the estimated demand for in-service training services for the last two years of the&#13;
project (US$41.1 million). As described in para. 2.05(b) above, the Government has committed to prepare a law which&#13;
will define the principles guiding the financing of in-service training.&#13;
21 Excluding an estimated US$14.3 million for taxes.&#13;
3.06    Financing.  The proposed Bank loan of US$23.0 equivalent comprising (a) a tranche equal to&#13;
US$11.5 million and (b) a tranche equal to FRF 60.3 million would finance 24% of total project cost net of&#13;
taxes and duties therefore covenrng 50% of the foreign exchange needs of the project. Enterprises and&#13;
employees would contribute US$30.7 million or 32% of the project through either direct contribution or the&#13;
VTT.  The Govenmment contribution, which is defined as the amount budgeted by the Government&#13;
(including donors' contributions) is estimated at US$41.6 million or 43% of the project costs. Retroactive&#13;
financing up to US$1 million of the loan amount ma' finance eligible expenditures incurred after July 1,&#13;
1996.&#13;

3.07    Project sustainability. The resources allocated to the MVT will not be increased as a result of the&#13;
project which is an integral part of the sector strategy. The operating expenditures of the GIACs will be&#13;
partly covered by the enterprises through their membership fees, and the total subsidy provided by the&#13;
Government to that initiative represents less than 2% of the MVT annual budget. Moreover, Government&#13;
support to the GIACs aims at "jump-starting" in-service training and is not intended as a pernanent&#13;
arrangement. The annual operating expenditures of the CSF are already included in OFPPT's operating&#13;
budget. The project does not increase OFPPT's training capacity and thus does not require additional&#13;
staffing and operating expenses. In addition there will be: (i) an increase in the VTT receipts estimated at&#13;
US$12 million at full potential as a result of the January 1996 Government decision to extend it to&#13;
Industrial and Commercial Public Enterprises (EPICs), which had traditionally been exempted; (ii) the&#13;
centers' own resources generated from sales of training and counseling services to enterprises, and which&#13;
are estimated at a minimum of US$1.3 million a year for the Centers of Excellence alone. Finally, the Law&#13;
on in-service training (para. 2.05) to be elaborated will clarifv the financing of the system and ensure its&#13;
sustainability and efficiency, while permitting a progressive disengagement of the Government.&#13;
3.08    Economic Analysis.  Based on the 1986 and subsequent Moroccan Industrial Surveys, analyses&#13;
using a standard production function technique were used and show that, controlling for other observable&#13;
factors, training enterprises have a value added of 37% greater than non-training ones. Based on the&#13;
reported expenditures on training, the return on value added for the small- and micro-enterprises is 15%&#13;
(based on their median value added). It is considerably higher for medium firms, at 43%, and higher yet&#13;
for the largest size class, at 77% 13. Similarly, the data suggest that workers in enterprises that train tend&#13;
to earn 28% more than in enterprises that do not train. Based on the cost of training and the earnings of&#13;
13&#13;
These rates of return should be interpreted with some caution, particularly for the largest size class. Unlike other datasets, we have no measure&#13;
of firm expenditures on research and development or the extent of technology transfer. This is likely to be highly correlated with training&#13;
expenditures for the largest firms, hence overstating the rate of return to this group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
untrained and trained workers reported in the 1986 Industrial Survey, calculations suggest that in-service&#13;
training yields a rate of return of 42%. The Internal Rate of Return of total project costs and benefits is&#13;
estimated at 25% and its Net Present Value at US$33,527 million [see Annex 4 for detailed analyses].&#13;
B. Management and Implementation&#13;
3.09   The proposed project would be implemented over a period of 5 years and is expected to be&#13;
completed by June 30, 2001, and the Loan closing date would be December 31, 2001. A detailed&#13;
implementation schedule is included in Section 2.4.10 of the Implementation Volume.&#13;
3.10   Overall coordination and monitoring of the project would be ensured by the Ministry of Vocational&#13;
Training. Responsibility for execution of the project would be as follows: (i) implementation of the first&#13;
component, in line with the procedural manuals, would be the responsibility of the GIACs and of the COD;&#13;
(ii) the second component would be the responsibility of the Orientation Board of the CSF would define the&#13;
CSF's action plan and monitor its implementation by the Regional Commitment Committees. OFPPT&#13;
would ensure the secretariat of these two bodies as well as the processing of submissions; and (iii) the third&#13;
component would be implemented by OFPPT and the centers themselves. Staffing requirements and&#13;
functional links between the entities involved, as well as the monitoring indicators and reporting&#13;
mechanisms [see para. 2.16] have been developed as part of the procedural manuals of the GIAC, FIAC&#13;
and the CSF. The MVT would prepare and transmit to the Bank by April 30 and October 31 of each year&#13;
an implementation report, assessing progress to date according to the project monitoring indicators and&#13;
proposing the program for the next period, including the necessary budget allocation. [para. 5.03(e)].&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
3.11   The table below summarizes procurement arrangements for the project. With the exception of&#13;
consultant and training services eligible for financing under the FIAC or under the CSF (see para. 3.14&#13;
below), all procurement would be carried out in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
3.12   Goods. To the extent possible, and without interfering with the centers' development schedule,&#13;
contracts for goods would be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost US$350,000 equivalent or more, to&#13;
allow procurement of larger packages. Procurement through ICB shall be used for contracts costing more&#13;
than US$350,000 equivalent each and, is estimated to represent a total value of US$4.7 million for&#13;
purchase of training, office and computer equipment. For purposes of bid evaluation, under the ICB&#13;
procedures, local manufacturers will be granted a margin of preference in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines. Goods estimated to cost less than US$350.000 equivalent per contract may be procured&#13;
through National Competitive Bidding. Other smaller contracts below US$200,000 for local purchases for&#13;
starting up the project (such as office equipment and computers for the GIACs and the Centers), audio&#13;
visual material, books and journals as well as materials and supplies could be made using national&#13;
shopping (NS). Local suppliers are expected to obtain about 25% of the value of the goods to be financed&#13;
by the Bank.&#13;

3.13   Civil Works. The majority of contracts will be inferior to US$200,000 and therefore unlikely to&#13;
interest international bidders. National Competitive Bidding procedures (NCB), which are acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. will therefore be used. Civil works will not be financed by the Bank loan.&#13;
3.14   Consultants' Services. Studies and training other than that financed under the FIAC or the CSF&#13;
will be contracted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). The choice of procurement method for&#13;
specialist services to be partially financed by the FIAC will be left to enterprises. The average cost of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
contract is estimated at US$8,000. To be eligible, enterprises will be required to enter a formal contract&#13;
with the consulting firm. This requirement is laid out in the procedural manual of the FIAC [see para.&#13;
2.021. Moreover, the GIACs will make available to enterprises a database of qualified international and&#13;
national experts which it will constitute and periodically update through a largely advertised invitation to&#13;
submit credentials for prequalification. Finally, to ensure a transfer of know-how and build up the capacity&#13;
of human resources specialists in Morocco, partnerships of international and national consultants will be&#13;
encouraged. Similarly. the choice of procurement method for training and counseling services to be&#13;
partially financed under the CSF will be left to enterprises. Based on 1994 actual figures, the average cost&#13;
of each contract was US$3,000. Eligibilitv criteria for partial reimbursement of training contracts to&#13;
enterprises as well as the documentation to be provided by enterprises are defined in the CSF procedural&#13;
manual [see para 2.02]. Assurances were given that contracts to be financed under the FIAC will be&#13;
procured according to the agreed FIAC Procedural Manual and that contracts to be reimbursed under the&#13;
CSF will be procured according to the agreed CSF Procedural Manual [para. 5.03(d)] including the&#13;
requirement that services to be financed under the Loan shall be procured at a reasonable price, account&#13;
being taken of the quality and competence of the parties rendering them.&#13;
3.15   Bank Prior Review of Procurement Documentation. All contracts for consulting services, training&#13;
or studies, with the exception of that financed by the FIAC and the CSF. valued at more than US$100,000&#13;
for consulting firms and US$50,000 for individual consultants and contracts for goods estimated to cost&#13;
more than $350,000 will be subject to prior review bv the Bank. The Bank's prior review is expected to&#13;
cover about 30% of the total Bank-financed procurement.  Small consulting contracts valued below&#13;
US$ 100,000 for consulting firms and US$50,000 for individual consultants will require prior review of the&#13;
terms of reference only. Contracts for goods below US$350,000 equivalent will be subject to ex-post&#13;
review by the Bank and will be retained for review by Bank supervision missions. Contracts for consulting&#13;
and training services financed under the FIAC and the CSF will be reviewed ex-post through regular audits&#13;
and supervision missions.&#13;

3.17   Documentation. Except for contracts requiring prior review, disbursements would be made against&#13;
certified SOEs, the format of which will be agreed upon with the Bank to facilitate identification of project&#13;
categories. Supporting documents for SOEs would be retained by the implementing agencies for at least&#13;
one year after the Bank receives the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made.&#13;
This documentation would be made available for review by auditors and visiting staff upon request. With&#13;
regards to component A (GIAC/FIAC), and component D requests for payment of eligible expenditures&#13;
would be grouped so that disbursement requests to the Bank be superior to US$50,000 equivalent.&#13;
3.18   Special Accounts. To facilitate the timely implementation of the project, the Government would&#13;
establish two Special Accounts respectively for Component I and 4, and Component 2 and 3 on terms and&#13;
conditions acceptable to the Bank. The authorized allocations will be respectively US$800,000 and&#13;
US$1,500,000 covering the Bank's share of 3-4 months of estimated expenditures. When the Loan&#13;
becomes effective, the Borrower may request an initial deposit to each of the two SAs not exceeding&#13;
US$400,000 and US$500,000 respectively. Additional deposit(s) may be requested when the amounts&#13;
committed and/or disbursed for each of these components reach US$3 million. The SA will be replenished&#13;
by submitting withdrawal applications to the Bank on a monthly basis, or whenever the account is&#13;
diminished by one-third, whichever is sooner. Replenishment applications submitted against the SA will&#13;
include monthly bank statements showing account activity since the last application, a reconciliation&#13;
statement and supporting documents as required by the Bank. With regards to the counterpart funds&#13;
related to the CSF, a separate budget line item will be created within OFPPT's budget and funds allocated&#13;
to it annually.&#13;
E. Accounts, Reporting and Audits&#13;
3.19   The Borrower will maintain appropriate records of accounts and prepare bi-annual financial and&#13;
operating progress reports as well as an Implementation Completion Report within six months of the loan&#13;
closing date. An independent auditor acceptable to the Bank would: (a) audit project accounts; (b) apply&#13;
auditing standards and procedures satisfactory to the Bank that conform to generally accepted auditing&#13;
practices; (c) carry out its auditing work in a timely manner--an annual report would be presented to the&#13;
Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year; and (d) render an audit opinion on project&#13;
accounts including the Special Accounts and the use of Statement of Expenses or the reason whereby such&#13;
opinion cannot be rendered and provide a financial statement of OFPPT and the associations to be created.&#13;
In addition, in line with their respective procedural manuals, the GIACs and CSF will be subjected to&#13;
annual audits by independent auditors. These audits will be transmitted to the Bank. With regards to the&#13;
GIACs and the CSFs, monitoring indicators and reporting mechanisms acceptable to the Bank have been&#13;
agreed upon and will be transmitted annually to the Bank.&#13;
F. Supervision and Monitoring&#13;
3.20   Status of Project Preparation. Preparation of the project is well advanced. The GIAC and FIAC&#13;
statutes and Procedural Manuals have been prepared, and one GIAC has been officially formed. The&#13;
marketing of this initiative has been actively pursued by the Government since appraisal. With regards to&#13;
the second component, the CSF procedural manual has been prepared and approved by the OFPPT Board.&#13;
Terms of reference for the studies of the 4th component have been prepared. With regards to the Centers of&#13;
Excellence, all actions related to the first year of implementation have been defined in detail and a&#13;
launching seminar including heads of VT centers involved in the project has taken place in July 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.21   Supervision. In the first fiscal year (FY97). one launching seminar will be planned for 9 staff&#13;
weeks (sw) followed by two supervision missions a year for the remaining four years (12 sw per year)&#13;
The supervision missions will focus on the progress of the objectives, targets and schedules of each sub-&#13;
component based on the project indicators and expected outputs which are found in section VIII of the&#13;
Implementation Volume, and will undertake corrective actions if necessary.  By July 31, 1999 the&#13;
Government will prepare a comprehensive progress report and transmit it to the Bank to be discussed&#13;
during a mid-term review to be held no later than November 30, 1999 [para. 5.03(f)]. The mid-term review&#13;
will not only assess the project's implementation progress in greater detail, but also to what extent the&#13;
project needs to be restructured to achieve its objectives, in particular in view of: (i) progress in the&#13;
elaboration of the in-service training law and to what extent this law reflects the agreed objectives; (ii)&#13;
progress in the elaboration and implementation of the sector strategy and its related action plan; and (iii)&#13;
the need to modify the design of the project in the light of both the new law and the sector strategy. A&#13;
summary of key indicators to be used for overall project monitoring has been elaborated [Annex 5]. The&#13;
Government has provided the base line and target data for the project monitoring indicators which will be&#13;
updated annually in the progress reports throughout the duration of the project [para. 5.03(c)].&#13;
G. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.22   As currently formulated, the proposed project was reviewed under the procedures specified in&#13;
O.D.4.01, Annex A: Environmental Assessment, and was determined to be in screening category C which&#13;
includes projects that normally do not result in significant environmental impact.  No Environmental&#13;
Assessment (EA) is expected to be conducted for this project.&#13;
IV. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
4.01   Proiect Benefits. The proposed project would make a significant contribution to upgrading the&#13;
skills of Morocco's labor force and the competitiveness of its enterprises. Major changes in policy and&#13;
governance structure of the CSF alreadv agreed with the Government, enterprises and labor would result in&#13;
a shared responsibility and financing between the main beneficiaries and a rapid increase of the number of&#13;
enterprises which retrain their workforce. The number of enterprises which would apply to the CSF&#13;
scheme to retrain their workers is estimated to increase from 620 in 1994 to 2,100 by project completion,&#13;
and the number of workers enrolled in the OFPPT's evening courses, from 7,700 to at least 19,000 in&#13;
2001. The institutional and legal framework would also improve through the adoption of a comprehensive&#13;
law on in-service training, the elaboration of an overall long-term VT strategy and its related action plan,&#13;
and the creation of strong linkages between the selected public training centers and the enterprises. The&#13;
professional associations would also benefit from the project by broadening the range of services they&#13;
provide to their members and exploiting economies of scale in training. It will also improve training&#13;
outcomes by taking actions on both the demand and supply sides. Finallv, the private proprietary training&#13;
institutions would benefit from the project through greater access to the VTT, which will promote&#13;
competition between both public and proprietary training institutions, and thus efficiency. Over time, the&#13;
project would generate significant economic benefits to both the enterprises and the State, on a sustained&#13;
basis, generating an internal rate of return of 25% (see economic analyses in Annex 4.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
4.02   Project Risks. The incentives provided to the enterprises through the GIACS and FIAC aim at&#13;
reducing the risk of a low demand for training. However, a persistent low demand may be a result of&#13;
severe structural impediments to the increase of enterprises' competititveness, outside the training sphere,&#13;
which would be addressed through other components of the government private sector development&#13;
program. There are institutional risks involved with the GIACs, which are new structures to be created&#13;
under the project, and particularly with the financing of in-service training, which include the reform of the&#13;
CSF scheme and the enactment of a law. To reduce these risks, project preparation focused on building a&#13;
strong consensus around the GIACs and the CSF scheme. This exercise led to the development of detailed&#13;
procedural manuals, including monitoring, reporting and auditing requirements, and the a posteriori control&#13;
needed. A number of drafts of these documents were widely shared among the Government and the&#13;
representatives of enterprises and labor unions, and following the incorporation of their comments, a final&#13;
version was finalized with the World Bank assistance and endorsed by all of them. This should provide a&#13;
strong basis for future cooperation between the stakeholders and especially for the consultative process of&#13;
preparation of the law.&#13;
4.03   There is also the risk that OFPPT's efforts to better adapt to enterprises' needs fail to induce a&#13;
greater implication of the private sector in its centers of excellence. This may represent the greatest&#13;
economic risk of this project and has been addressed in a variety of ways. First, it has been recognized&#13;
since the beginning that only a limited number of training centers have the potential to evolve into centers of&#13;
excellence, based on the industrial and employment potentials of their catchment area, their demonstrated&#13;
ability to establish training links with the private sector (through the setting up of a private sector steering&#13;
committee,) and the preparation of self development plans. Adequate incentives were provided to the staff&#13;
to increase their self-generated resources and a matrix of detailed performance indicators (Annex 7) was&#13;
developed with the World Bank assistance to monitor the centers' progress against their own assessment.&#13;
As regards investments, technical assistance and training of trainers and managers would be financed&#13;
primarily by the Bank loan and front-loaded to provide the centers with essential inputs to initiate the&#13;
change. Training equipment would be financed by the Government and provided only to those among the&#13;
36 centers that would complete an in-depth assessment of their equipment needs and show a progress&#13;
record in line with the objectives set in their development plans. Finally, the project approach to bring&#13;
about improvements in the system by promoting change within the public sector is much less prone to be&#13;
hampered by socio-political resistance than any alternative that would bypass the public sector.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.01   During preparation of the project, the following actions were taken:&#13;
(a)    a set of 20 criteria combining student insertion performances, links with enterprises,&#13;

STEPS IN THE PREPARATION OF A DRAFT LAW ON IN-SERVICE TRAINING&#13;
Objective:&#13;
1.     The objective is to formulate a draft law that institutionalizes and makes permanent the measures&#13;
taken by the Government to promote in-service vocational training. The law in question will take into&#13;
account the entire spectrum of issues involved in in-service training at the national level and, in particular,&#13;
will: (i) clarify the organization of in-service training, (ii) define the role of the various social partners&#13;
(businesses, associations and trade groups, representatives of workers, the State, communities); and (iii)&#13;
identify the portion of the VTT to be earmarked to in-service training and define the mechanisms for its&#13;
financing.  It will also reflect the general principles implemented under the Third Private Sector&#13;
Development Project (in-service vocational training), for which World Bank financing is envisaged. Those&#13;
general principles are as follows:&#13;
-      making business responsible: The State will disengage from the direct management of in-&#13;
service training and keep only its super-visorv role;&#13;
-      independence: establishment of an  autonomous  entity jointly  managed  by  trade&#13;
organizations and representatives of workers, whose function will be to manage the funds&#13;
allocated to in-service vocational training;&#13;
pooled financing of in-service vocational training through the allocation of a portion of the&#13;
VTT.&#13;
Methodology:&#13;
2.     Preparation of the law will be overseen by a steering committee set up within the Ministry of&#13;
Vocational Training, whose mission will be to:&#13;
draw up an inventory and digest of studies, legal texts (and in particular the labor code)&#13;
and other reports concerned with in-service training;&#13;
prepare detailed terns of reference for the experts to be engaged for the formulation of the&#13;
proposed law and draft the accompanying explanatory statement;'4&#13;
ensure the interface between those experts and the other stakeholders, in particular labor&#13;
and business representatives;&#13;
14  The cost of technical assistance for the preparation of the law was estimated on the basis of four months of experts as follows:&#13;
I economist, lawyer/specialist in institutional issues and I specialist in human resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 2&#13;
organize a seminar that brings together all partners, to present the cost-benefits of the&#13;
proposed alternatives as well as the experience of other countries in dealing with the same&#13;
issues.&#13;
Timetable:&#13;
3.     The proposed timetable splits implementation into two phases: (i) phase 1, entailing preparation of&#13;
the explanatory statement and a first draft of the law, lasting about one year; and (ii) the approval of the&#13;
draft law by the Cabinet (Conseil du Gouvemement).&#13;

PREPARATION OF A LONG-TERM STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN&#13;
FOR VOCATIONAL TRAINING&#13;
Objective:&#13;
I .    The Government of Morocco is convinced of the need to adapt vocational training structures: (i) by&#13;
involving the public and private sectors in the planning, management and financing of vocational training;&#13;
(ii) encouraging the expansion of private training centers; and (iii) subjecting vocational training centers to&#13;
competition through progressive allocation of the VTT to a demand-driven financing scheme.&#13;
2.     With a view to implementing these principles, the Government will launch a comprehensive study&#13;
of the issues, to be overseen by the Ministry of Vocational Training, and aimed at formulating a long-term&#13;
sectoral strategy for vocational training and identifying the sequence of reforms that will facilitate its&#13;
implementation. The studies and other necessary work preparatory to the development of the strategy will&#13;
be among activities financed under the World Bank's third loan for private sector development (in-service&#13;
training). No more than fourteen months after loan signature, this process should lead to the formulation&#13;
by the Government of the strategy document that will be forwarded to the Bank. That strategy will serve as&#13;
a foundation for the formulation of the sector's next two five-year plans.&#13;
Description of the strategy formulation process:&#13;
3.    The process will begin with the appointment by the Minister of Vocational Training of a Strategy&#13;
Formulation Committee (Comite d 'Elaboration de la Strategie -- CES) composed of four to eight people,&#13;
each of whom would be designated individually, and the CES would be responsible for setting the pace and&#13;
timetable of the studies and works to be undertaken, formulate terms of reference for the studies to be&#13;
launched, analyze the conclusions of the various inputs and studies it contracts and, lastly, prepare a&#13;
synthesis of its work, which it will send to the Government. The synthesis will include in particular a&#13;
diagnostic study and proposals for modernizing the institutions, regulatory framework and the means of&#13;
financing vocational training. This first phase is expected to take eight months.&#13;
4.     At the conclusion of the first phase, the Government will begin a series of consultations with the&#13;
social partners to build a consensus on the proposed reforms and identify the means and implementation&#13;
timetable. After six months, the Government will formulate its long-term development strategy for&#13;
vocational training and fonward it to the Bank for information.&#13;
Means to be allocated for preparation:&#13;
5.    During the last ten years the MVT and OFPPT have carried out many comprehensive studies,&#13;
several of which are still valid. The CES will have access to that documentation and will have funds to&#13;
finance the following activities:&#13;
Studies: When necessary, supplementary studies will be done in the field to expand the data of the&#13;
diagnostic study, through inputs from Moroccan or expatnate experts to the analysis of constraints and&#13;
dysfunctional aspects of the system, and identification of possible reforms;&#13;
&#13;

Overseas fact-finding missions: Two overseas fact-finding missions for committee members (4 to 8 people)&#13;
are planned in order to learn from the experience of other countries which, facing comparable conditions,&#13;
have overcome the constraints and embarked upon similar reforms;&#13;
Seminar: Two seminars are planned in order to enable the MVT to organize consultations for consensus&#13;
building on the objectives of the reform.&#13;
Timetable:&#13;

Project Impact Evaluations Studies:&#13;
Analytical Approach and Terms of Reference&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     The evaluation of the project impact faces acute informational problems. There are usually&#13;
good data on enterprises from the annual Industrial Survey and on training from the training&#13;
institutions, the MVT and the Ministry of Education. However, except for the 1986 Industrial Survey,&#13;
there is no information on the more extensive training that occurs in the private sector--in enterprises,&#13;
provided by equipment suppliers, and in private training institutions. Moreover, little is known about&#13;
the enterprise context in which training takes place, how decisions regarding training relate to other&#13;
enterprise strategies on investment, innovation, or work organization.&#13;
2.     The purpose of this Annex is to describe the studies that will be conducted to assess the impact&#13;
of the project. The Annex is organized in two sections. The first describes the analytical approach,&#13;
including data needs, analyses and expected results. The second section provides detailed Terms of&#13;
Reference for the studies and discusses various possible survey methods.&#13;

3.     The in-service Training Project in Morocco is designed to improve the skills of the workforce&#13;
and increase enterprise competitiveness via four project components. First, to help enterprises, MSIs&#13;
in particular, identify their skill needs through competency needs assessments (CNAs) conducted by&#13;
the Groupement Interprofessionnel d'Aide au Conseil (GIACs). Second, to encourage enterprises to&#13;
train workers either in-house or in public or private training centers by providing incentives through a&#13;
training payroll levy-grant system or the Contrats Speciaux de Formation (CSF). Third, to improve&#13;
the quality and relevance of in-service training provided to enterprises by selected OFPPT training&#13;
centers to be rehabilitated under the project. Finally, to strengthen policy formulation capacity of the&#13;
MVT and the legal framework for in-service training.&#13;
11. Data Needs for Project Impact Evaluations&#13;
4.     Specific kinds of information on enterprises and its workers are required to assess whether the&#13;
project is meeting its objectives of improving workforce skills and increasing industrial&#13;
competitiveness. Broadly, the following types of information are needed:&#13;
. First, information is needed on performance measures for two groups--one affected by an&#13;
intervention or a set of policies, and one that is not (the control group)--to measure the impact of&#13;
the intervention. In the case of enterprises, this might involve comparisons of the performance of&#13;
firms that implement some type of in-service training program and the performance of firms that&#13;
do not train. For workers, one might compare the wages, hours of work, or job turnover rates of&#13;
employees in enterprises with and without training.&#13;
* Second, information over time should be collected on the same groups of enterprises. Because&#13;
firms and its workers can be very heterogeneous, it is important that the impact of an intervention&#13;
be assessed by comparing post- and pre-intervention performance measures. Thus, one might&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-                                      Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
focus on changes over time in the productivity levels of training enterprises (or the wages of its&#13;
workers) and compare them to the performance of the control group of non-training enterprises&#13;
(and its workers).&#13;
*  Third, information  is needed on other contemporaneous attributes of workers and firms.&#13;
Performance is shaped not only by training but by other factors such as the education, work&#13;
experience, and family background of employees, or the productive attributes of firms such as&#13;
foreign or local ownership, technology, and market conditions. As such. program impacts on&#13;
workers or enterprises must be assessed net of the effects of these other variables on their&#13;
performance.&#13;
*  Finally, a scientifically-drawn  sample of enterprises should  be used  to collect firm-level&#13;
information.   Otherwise, the impact of the project on expanding the training efforts and&#13;
competitiveness of enterprises--a key objective of the project--cannot be assessed.  Small, non-&#13;
representative samples of firms are likely to yield unreliable measures of levels and time trends in&#13;
training incidence and performance, and result in evaluation studies that are both biased and&#13;
misleading.&#13;
5.     The requisite data to conduct a project evaluation study do not currently exist in Morocco and&#13;
will need to be collected systematically as part of the project. Specifically, surveys of enterprises at&#13;
the beginning, mid-term and end of the project are needed to monitor and investigate the impacts of&#13;
GIACs in helping enterprises identify skill needs and develop training plans, the role of CSF in&#13;
encouraging firms to initiate or expand training programs for their workers, and the use of in-service&#13;
training services provided by OFPPT  training centers.  The program  impact evaluation studies&#13;
proposed here--their objectives, data requirements, and analytical approach--are described below.&#13;
III. Analyses of Survev Results&#13;
6.     The following three examples, based on analyses of similar enterprise surveys by the World&#13;
Bank, illustrate some types of analyses that are possible with these surveys and the kinds of policy&#13;
questions that can be addressed.&#13;
1. Incidence of in-service training&#13;
7.     The data can be tabulated to describe the iicidence of in-service trailing in Morocco at one&#13;
point in time, or time trends in training when two or more surveys are fielded. The tabulations will&#13;
show the principal sources of training (in-house, public or private training centers, other private sector&#13;
firms, etc.), the main types of training given by different providers (vocationally specific, production,&#13;
or quality control), and the worker groups trained. When scientifically-drawn, the sample of firms can&#13;
be weighted to yield national estimates of the incidence of training, the number of workers trained and&#13;
the kinds of training received, and training trends over time.&#13;
8.     Policy issues: How prevalent is in-service training? Which employers train and which do not?&#13;
Do market failures inhibit training and what is the nature of these market failures? Do Moroccan firms&#13;
under-invest in training? What training is emphasized by firms? How important are public training&#13;
centers as a source of in-service training relative to the private sector? Have these patterns of training&#13;
changed over time?&#13;
9.     Illustrative results. The World Bank study of 5 developing countries concluded that: (i) firms&#13;
that train tend to be large, foreign-owned or joint-ventures, exporters in modern and technology-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -                                   Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
intensive sectors; (ii) the most important reason for little or no training is that employers use simple&#13;
technologies requiring few skills; (iii) however, market failures are also important -- many employers&#13;
do not train because they do not know how or what to train, they cannot internalize the benefits of&#13;
training because of high turnover of trained workers, and they are unable to finance training; (iv) with&#13;
some exceptions (Colombia), the private sector -- the firm itself, private training centers, and suppliers&#13;
-- plays a relatively more important role than the public sector in meeting in-service skill needs in&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
2. Productivity and wage impacts of training&#13;
10.    The data can be used to estimate the effects of training on the performance of employers and&#13;
workers. For employers, the productivity effect of training can be investigated within a production&#13;
function framework. Production functions, which relate a measure of productivity (value added) to&#13;
inputs of capital (value of plant and equipment) and labor (number of workers, skill mix, hours of&#13;
work), can be expanded to include inputs of training to estimate productivity effects by source and type&#13;
of training. Similarly, models can be used to estimate the effects of training on wage levels or the&#13;
probability of job turnover, for different groups of workers and by type and source of training.&#13;
11.    Policy issues: Does training improve firm-level productivity?  Which types and sources of&#13;
training are more important in terms of their effects on productivity? Are the productivity effects of&#13;
training similar to the wage effects of training by type of training or for different groups of workers?&#13;
Who pays for the cost of training?&#13;
12.    Illustrative results: The World Bank study finds evidence that: (i) training has a large positive&#13;
impact on productivity; (ii) the productivity impact of in-house training tends to be larger than that of&#13;
training provided by outside training providers; (iii) while training for skilled workers has a large&#13;
productivity impact, training for unskilled workers has no measurable impact on productivity; (iv) the&#13;
productivity impact of training is actually higher among small firms where few employers train than&#13;
among large firms most of whom train; (v) the wage effects of training resemble the productivity&#13;
effects of training -- large wage effects are found for skilled worker training but not for unskilled&#13;
workers; and (vi) the wage effects of employer investments in worker training are roughly comparable&#13;
to the wage effects of investments in new technology.&#13;
3. Training and productivity changes over time&#13;
13.    Following  the same sample of enterprises is critical since the incidence of training,&#13;
productivity and wages can change over time for reasons unrelated to the project. Thus, in program&#13;
evaluations, models should be estimated to explain changes over time in these variables controlling for&#13;
changes in the other determinants of training, productivity and wage growth. The availability of panel&#13;
information on the same firms is important for another reason, namely, the heterogeneity of firms.&#13;
Because enterprises and workers have very different productivity attributes, their productivity levels at&#13;
any one point in time can vary widely. As such, simply comparing the productivity levels of training&#13;
firms and non-training firms can be misleading. To identify the impact of introducing a training&#13;
program, training should be related to changes over time in productivity levels.&#13;
14.    The evaluation study of Mexico's Program of Training and Technical Assistance (CIMO) to&#13;
SMIs is illustrative. As part of the evaluation, a group of SMIs that received subsidized training--the&#13;
pilot group--were tracked over a three year period, and their performance compared to that of a control&#13;
group of SMIs that did not participate in the CIMO program. A simple comparison of the pilot and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -                                  Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
control groups at the end of the three year period showed no differences in the two groups'&#13;
performance (a wide range of outcome measures were considered). However, the pilot group firms&#13;
tended to have lower productivity prior to joining the CIMO program. When outcomes were measured&#13;
in terms of changes in productivity over time, the pilot group showed superior improvements in&#13;
performance with the productivity differential with the control group being narrowed or eliminated&#13;
entirely.&#13;
B. Terms of Reference&#13;
1. Objectives&#13;
15.    The objectives are (1) to develop firm-level data bases for tracking changes over time in the&#13;
incidence of in-service training, (2) to analyze the incentives of firms to train their employees, the&#13;
constraints they face in identifying skill needs and in developing in-service training programs, and the&#13;
effects of training on productivity growth and competitiveness, and (3) to assess the efficacv of training&#13;
policies--the GIACs in providing CNAs and the CSF in promoting in-service training, especially among&#13;
MSIs--and, as needed, to recommend policies to improve the Moroccan training system.&#13;
II. Surveys&#13;
16.    The surveys are intended to develop a broad base of firm-level information on the training and&#13;
productive activities of a sample of enterprises. The same sample of enterprises should be tracked over&#13;
tim, ideally in 1996 at the beginning of the project so as to provide a benchmark, and thereafter at two-&#13;
year intervals, in 1998 and in 2000, so that evaluations of training policies and support to MSIs can be&#13;
conducted and policies adapted as the project progresses. Firm-level information would be collected on five&#13;
broad areas:&#13;
1. Production: level of production and sales; exports, main products; domestic and foreign ownership;&#13;
value of machinery and equipment; degree of automation; total labor inputs and hours; intermediate&#13;
inputs and energy; and capacity utilization; horizontal and vertical linkages with other firms;&#13;
production constraints.&#13;
2. Emplovment: current level and changes in employment over the past 2 years; structure of employment&#13;
by broad occupation including managers, engineers, technicians, skilled production and unskilled&#13;
production, sales; gender composition of the workforce; mean years of schooling attainment by broad&#13;
occupation; job turnover rates; recruitment policies and hiring and job retention problems.&#13;
3. Compensation: average pay by occupation and gender; structure of compensation including wages and&#13;
salaries, bonuses, allowances, severance pay, and statutory payments as a percent of total wage bill.&#13;
4. Training  training infrastructure and trainers; informal OJT and formal training; number of workers&#13;
trained, hours and area of training, by broad occupation, in company training programs and from&#13;
external training providers such as the public training centers of the OFPPT, private training institutes,&#13;
equipment suppliers and buyers, and joint-venture partners. Also, policy questions on reimbursement&#13;
of vocational training tax, firm's use of specific training programs and assistance, and training&#13;
constraints.&#13;
5. Technology: spending on technology acquisition and know-how licenses; research and development;&#13;
quality control methods; new capital investment plans; problems and constraints faced in improving&#13;
technology and productivity.&#13;
&#13;

III. Survev Methods&#13;
17.    There are three alternative survey techniques. The relative merits and demerits of each should be&#13;
considered and a survey strategy (or combination of strategies) identified.&#13;
(1) Fielding a self-contained survey questionnaire to a scientifically-drawn random sample of&#13;
enterprises and tracking them over time. This approach will requite the assistance of the national statistical&#13;
office to develop a sampling frame (list of company names, addresses., contact person and telephone/fax&#13;
numbers) and survey weights that will allow the survey results to be made nationally representative. The&#13;
sample would likely be stratified by firm size because of the large numbers of MSIs relative to large firms.&#13;
For analytical purposes, the sample should include a minimum of 500 firms. The Moroccan surveys can&#13;
build on several survey instruments operationalized by the World Bank on similar human resources&#13;
projects in other countries. The survey can either be conducted by the national statistical office or by a&#13;
private survey firm, which in many cases can deliver the survey in a more timely fashion.&#13;
(2) Building on existing annual firm surveys and adding a supplemental module of key questions.&#13;
Many national statistical agencies, including that of Morocco, already field large, nationally representative&#13;
firm-level surveys on an ongoing, annual basis. These surveys elicit many important quantitative questions&#13;
listed above, such as differcnt firm characteristics, industry, production and inputs, book value of&#13;
machinery, cxports, ownership structure, employment and composition. wages and salaries, etc. The&#13;
remaining information -- training, technology and policy related variables--can be elicited by adding a short&#13;
module to the statistical agency's survey instrument. Whether the module covers all or part of the firm&#13;
sample will depend upon the budget of the project and the statistical agency's interviewer resources.&#13;
(3) Using administrative records concurrently with periodic surveys of firms. Administrative&#13;
records from the vocational training tax (VTT) are a potentially important source of information. The&#13;
feasibility of creating a database from VTT administrative records depends in part on how this information&#13;
is currently collected, and in part on the Moroccan government's willingness to restructure its&#13;
administrative recording system of the Vocational Training Tax (VTT). Firms contributing to the VTT&#13;
could be required to provide the administrative agency of the OFPPT with limited information on&#13;
characteristics of enterprises, its employment, wages, VTT contributions, training practices and both&#13;
numbers and types of workers trained, if any. These records provide not only information on the universe&#13;
of firms contributing to the VTT, but also the sampling frame needed to conduct periodic, more detailed&#13;
sample surveys of firms claiming reimbursements for training as well as firms that contribute but do not&#13;
train.&#13;
For Morocco, the second method has several distinct advantages over the others:&#13;
*  It economizes on the heavy fixed costs of fielding a survey (developing the sampling frame,&#13;
training survey enumerators etc.), especially one that will be repeated over time, by using the&#13;
ministry of industry's existing survey infrastructure and benefiting from its long experience with&#13;
firms in the survey.&#13;
*  It immediately yields a large body of time-series information on the same firms in the survey. This&#13;
information is important not only for characterizing the previous growth and productivity&#13;
performance of firms, which shapes their incentives to train, but also for studying the future&#13;
economic impacts of in-service training.&#13;
*  It expedites impact evaluation studies since training questions were included in the industrial&#13;
survey in the early 1990s. These previous training questions can be used to establish a training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -                                   Annex 3&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
bench-mark for the new surveys to be conducted under the project, and to begin exploratory&#13;
analyses of training impact on firm-level productivity while the new survey is being fielded.&#13;
* Finally, it will provide policymakers with important data for competitiveness studies. In addition&#13;
to training data, the augmented surveys will collect, for a large nationally-representative sample of&#13;
firms, data on enterprises' technology use, R &amp; D spending, use of quality control methods,&#13;
exports, and inter-firm linkages which not only shape their skill and training needs but also their&#13;
productivity growth.&#13;
IV. Analyses and Evaluation&#13;
18.    Several types of analyses and evaluations will be performed by bringing firm-level information&#13;
together from the five broad topic areas:&#13;
* Analysts should monitor and measure the extent and changes over time in the incidence of in-service&#13;
training, from the different sources of training-- in-plant training, and training provided by the different&#13;
OFPPT public training centers including centers of excellence, by private training institutes, and bv&#13;
equipment suppliers and buyers--by industrial sector and by firm size, especially among small and&#13;
medium size industries (MSls) that provide workers with little or no formal training.&#13;
* Analysts should analyze the incentives of employers to train their workers, whether or not they have&#13;
training plans, competency needs assessments done by GIACs and usefulness of such CNAs, the&#13;
demand for skills created by changing technology, exports and increased international competition, as&#13;
well as the constraints faced by firms in developing in-service training programs. These analvses&#13;
should be used to develop or modify policies to support the training and productivity improving efforts&#13;
of firms.&#13;
* Analysts should assess the effects of in-service training on alternative outcomes for firms and workers.&#13;
For enterprises, the benefits include productivity growth. increased competitiveness, exports, reductions&#13;
in rejects, improvements in quality control, job retention, etc. For workers, the benefits of in-service&#13;
training include higher wages and salaries, bonuses, improved job safety, and greater job stability.&#13;
- Analysts should evaluate the efficacy of the vocational training tax (VTT) in promoting in-service&#13;
training, especially among the MSIs, by tracking their training efforts and reimbursements from the&#13;
training fund.  Firm  responses to the operation of the VTT can also be used to streamline&#13;
administrative procedures, identify and develop new "training products", and disseminate best practice&#13;
to firms about in-service training and its benefits for employers and workers.&#13;

Economic Analyses&#13;
1.    The objective of the following economic analyses for the Third Private Sector Development Project&#13;
is primarily to measure the impact of in-service training activities (which is the focus of the project) on the&#13;
value added of enterprises and the earning of workers. Based on the findings of these analyses the&#13;
following sections examine (i) the rate of return to the project, (ii) an alternative project design. and (iii) the&#13;
project fiscal impact.&#13;
A- The Impact of In-service Training on Enterprises and Workers.&#13;
2.     The data source is the 1986 and 1990 Moroccan Industrial Surveys.  Each survey asked&#13;
enterprises in the manufacturing sector detailed questions on sales, revenues, output, exports, employment&#13;
and components of value added. The 1986 survey had additional questions on in-service training: the&#13;
number of workers trained; the duration of the training in months; and the cost of the training in DH 1,000.&#13;
The 1990 survey asked questions about the capital stock in the firm. We converted all nominal values to&#13;
1993 DH values for reporting purposes.&#13;
3.     Any firm which reported a nonzero number of workers trained was classified as a training firm in&#13;
1986.  One hundred ninety five out of 4,354 firms were thus classified.  Their characteristics are&#13;
summarized in Table 1.&#13;

It is obvious from this table that firms that train are larger, employ more workers, export more, and in 1986&#13;
paid more than twice as much in wages as do non-training firms. This is consistent with other countries:&#13;
larger firms are much more likely to train than smaller firms, and their workers earn more. They are also&#13;
much more likely to survive: a comparison between 1986 and 1993 Industrial Surveys demonstrates that 9&#13;
out of 10 firms that trained in 1986 were still operating 7 years later, compared with 3 out of 4 nontraining&#13;
firms (although this is highly correlated with the fact that training firms are also much larger).&#13;
4.     There are a number of reasons why firms do not train, and many of these are linked to firm size.&#13;
One is lack of information both about the returns to training and where to get workers trained. Small&#13;
enterprises are less likely to have access to such information than the larger ones. Another is that there are&#13;
economies of scale in training and small firms that only want to train one or two workers find the cost too&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-                                       Annex 4&#13;

high. The third problem is that firms do not recoup all the gains from training: by its very nature, training&#13;
is embodied in the worker, and when the worker leaves (or goes to another firm) he or she takes the training&#13;
along.&#13;
5.     Training incidence varies substantially across industries, and this variation is most readilv seen by&#13;
glancing at Figure 1, which shows that firms in beverage and tobacco products are the most likely to train:&#13;
21% of firms in this industry train. and almost 2% of their workers go through a training program. Firms&#13;
in other industries are much less likelv to invest in training: notably firms in textiles, clothing, rubber and&#13;
plastic products and food products. More detailed information is provided in the figure below.&#13;

6.     This difference in the incidence of training raises the question of the determinants of training.&#13;
Research in other countries suggests that very similar factors determine training needs: that more mature&#13;
firms are more likely to train as are firms that have to compete intemationally in the export market and that&#13;
have more skilled workers. We have already established that Moroccan firms are like their counterparts in&#13;
that larger firms are more likely to train than smaller - Table 2 demonstrates that the determinants of&#13;
training are the same in direction, if not in magnitude, as those of other countries. In other words, the size&#13;
and age effects are extremely important in Morocco, as in other countries. This raises two issues related to&#13;
the point made in paragraph 2.&#13;

7.      The gross descriptions presented in Table I suggested that firms that train are more productive,&#13;
and pay higher wages than firms that do not train. However. it is not obvious that this is due to training&#13;
alone: clearly there are other confounding factors (such as size and the use of capital intensive techniques)&#13;
which could also cause these differences. We therefore estimate a standard production function for&#13;
Moroccan enterprises using the 1990 information on capital stock, value added, employment and exports.&#13;
We instrument current training practices using the 1986 information creating an indicator variable for&#13;
whether or not the firm trained any workers. We also control for industry differences by means of industry&#13;
fixed effects, and estimate the relationship using White's correction for heteroskedastic errors. The results&#13;
are reported in Table 3'5 and compared with other countries.&#13;
8.      Our analysis suggests that, controlling for other observable factors, training firms have a value&#13;
added which is 37% higher than nontraining firms. This may be an overstatement, since no data are&#13;
available on the amount of research and development and technology transfer engaged in by the firm, but is&#13;
certainly well in line with estimates for other countries - up to 44% in the comparison group we are using.&#13;
9.      The strength of this training effect is not surprising. When so few firms are training, it is likely&#13;
that there are significant barriers to training in the country, and hence that those that train must have high&#13;
returns to such an investment. We have data on training expenditures, and graphically show the link&#13;
between training expenditures and value added in Figure 2.&#13;
1   Since there are so few microenterprises that train, we pool the micro and small categories, and use this as the omitted&#13;
group.&#13;

10.    We estimate this link using a production function approach.  There were several measurement&#13;
difficulties involved with estimating the link between training expenditures and value added. Firstly,&#13;
training expenditures are notoriously poorly reported in other datasets, so although we are not directly&#13;
aware of any problems in this dataset, the results should be interpreted with some caution. Secondly, only&#13;
120 firms reported their training expenditures. We calculated the average expenditure on training per&#13;
worker for those firms (DH10,920), and imputed that to those 66 firms which reported training a number&#13;
of workers, but did not report that cost.&#13;
11.    There were also technical difficulties in the estimation process. It is unrealistic to assume that&#13;
training expenditures enter into the production relationship in the same fashion as do expenditures on&#13;
;apital and labor. That is, a Cobb-Douglas production function implicitly assumes that if there are zero&#13;
expenditures on either capital or labor, then output and value added must similarly be zero. Zero&#13;
expenditures on training, however, do not similarly imply zero output. We therefore specify training&#13;
expenditures in 1993 DH, and include this variable directly into the production relationship16.  The&#13;
coefficient should be read as the effect of an increase of DHl,000 on the log of value added. Since the&#13;
effect of training is likely to vary by size, we interact training expenditures by size of firm as well.&#13;
12.    We report the results in Table 3. Training expenditures unambiguously increase value added, even&#13;
controlling for employment size and capital stock. The coefficient of .00069 means that for every DH 1,000&#13;
increase in training expenditures, value added in the smallest firms grew by .00069%. Since the median&#13;
value added of firms in this category is DH434,000, the typical firm would expect to see a first year&#13;
increase in value added of some DH299 as a result of that initial expenditure. Similarly, the combined&#13;

effect (including the interaction effect) for the next size of firm is .00008%, and the median value added&#13;
for this size class is DH6,455,000. Thus, although the percentage effect is smaller, the return in absolute&#13;
terms is larger: DH516 in the first year for DH1000 invested. The largest size class see the greatest DH&#13;
return of all: their median size is DH27,173,000 and the return on a DHI1,000 investment in training is&#13;
DH815.&#13;
13.    There are a series of reasons to believe that market failure has occurred in the provision of training&#13;
in Morocco. First, the incidence of training is much lower than in other countries (see table 2 in main text.)&#13;
This suggests that firms in Morocco may face different sets of barriers than those in other countries.&#13;
Second, the fact that the incidence is much lower for smaller firms than for larger is consistent with the&#13;
sources of market failure. Small firms are less likely to have the same access to information as large firms&#13;
about the type, quality, and source of training. They are also subject to the problem of economies of scale:&#13;
there are fewer employees over which to spread the fixed cost of training. Another source of market failure&#13;
is that firms face the prospect of losing trained workers, and hence losing the return on human capital&#13;
investment. This loss of human capital is much less likely in large firms, which typically have well&#13;
developed internal labor markets to retain workers: indeed turnover is less in large than in small firms.&#13;
Third, if firms are rational, the return on physical and human capital should be equated. This is unlikely&#13;
given the very high 5 year internal rate of return on training reported in table 4 below. This again suggests&#13;
market failure.&#13;
14.    There are a series of reasons why the return to training is so high for the largest firms. Some may&#13;
be technical (measurement error, for example). Others might reflect differences in the ability of large firms&#13;
to obtain quality training, or the ability of large firms to combine training with research and development.&#13;
This latter is not measured in our data, but is clearly highly correlated with the returns to training.&#13;

15.    Although Table 3 indicates that there is a positive return to investment in training, it is instructive&#13;
to estimate the order of magnitude of this return. The increase in value added is likely to continue for a&#13;
number of years, especially since trained workers both use the knowledge daily in completing their tasks,&#13;
and because they pass their knowledge on to other workers in the enterprise. Any number of assumptions&#13;
can be made about the number of periods for which the increase lasts, and about how fast the increase&#13;
depreciates. Table 4 provides some estimates of the internal rate of return to the initial investment on&#13;
training, based on different assumptions about how long the impact lasts and what those depreciation rates&#13;
are likely to be. We choose the median value added of firms in each category in order to estimate this&#13;
relationship.&#13;

16.    If we look at the first cell in each category, the return on value added for the small and micro&#13;
enterprises is 15% (based on their median value added). It is considerably higher for medium finns, at&#13;
41%, and higher yet for the largest size class, at 70%. These rates of return should be interpreted with&#13;
some caution, particularly for the largest size class. Unlike other datasets, we have no measure of firm&#13;
expenditures on research and development or the extent of technology transfer. This is likely to be highly&#13;
correlated with training expenditures for the largest firms, and hence overstating the rate of return to this&#13;
group.&#13;
17.    We repeat the estimation using intensive techniques to deternine the effect of training on&#13;
productivity and wages. This is reported in Table 5. The effect of training on productivity is to increase it&#13;
by 33%; it increases average pay by 28%.&#13;

18.   This enables us to verify the intemal rate of return estimate presented in Table 4 using a "short-&#13;
cut" technique. As Tan and Mingat (1988) point out, the internal rate of return can also be estimated by&#13;
r = [E(T)-E(U)] / {n*E(U) + C}&#13;
where E(T) is the eamings of trained workers; E(U) refers to the eamings of untrained workers, n is the&#13;
duration of training and C is the cost of training. Calculations suggest that if training were to increase the&#13;
average wage of workers in firns that do not train by 28%, and the cost of that training is DHI 0,920, then&#13;
this short cut method yields a rate of return of 42%: very close to the range of estimates calculated using&#13;
the more sophisticated approach.&#13;
B - Rate of Retum to the Project and Sensitivity Analyses&#13;
19.    The project generates significant economic benefits to both the enterprises and the State, on a&#13;
sustained basis. The project Intemal Rate of Retum (IRR) is estimated at 25% and the calculation is&#13;
summarized in table 6 below. The following assumptions have been used for the computation of the project&#13;
cost and benefits:&#13;
*   The costs include all capital expenditures, training costs, technical assistance, equipment,&#13;
works, and physical and price contingencies.&#13;
*   The incremental recurrent cost for the GIACs are already included in the project cost. There&#13;
are no incremental recurrent cost for the project's second, third and fourth components&#13;
because they do not generate additional recurrent expenditures in salaries or maintenance of&#13;
equipment and buildings.&#13;
*   Three types of benefits have been considered. First, the findings summarized in para. 11&#13;
above suggest that the increase in enterprises' value added resulting from the training&#13;
activities financed by the project's second component (CSF) can be estimated. The estimation&#13;
is carried out under the assumption that all enterprises are medium-sized and that the effect of&#13;
training continues for 5 years without any depreciation. Thus, the typical enterprise would&#13;
expect to see a five-year increase in value added of some DH516 as a result of an initial&#13;
expenditure in training of DH1,000.&#13;
*   Second, since the project does not create additional pre-service training capacity, the retums&#13;
to pre-service training in the potential centers of excellence are not included as a benefit, and&#13;
the trainees' lost productivity during their period of training (opportunity cost) is not included&#13;
as a cost. However, as a result of the project the centers of excellence would be more relevant&#13;
to enterprises' training needs, would have highly qualified trainers and modem equipment,&#13;
thus they would be capable of responding to the changing needs of the labor market in a&#13;
quicker and more meaningful fashion than in the current situation. Therefore, we assume that&#13;
the average job search period of the centers of excellence's graduates would be reduced from&#13;
currently 10.5 months to 3 months. About 5,000 students would graduate each year from the&#13;
36 centers of excellence, and eam US$2,050 per year on average. The reduction in their job-&#13;
search period is worth US$ 6.5 million a year.&#13;
*   Finally, the last benefit is the resources generated by the centers of excellence from sales of&#13;
training and counseling services to enterprises (Compte Hors Budget, CHB). This benefit is&#13;
estimated at a minimum of US$1.3 million a year for the centers of excellence.&#13;
*   The US$ value of such costs and benefits has been estimated in constant 1994 prices, using&#13;
the exchange rate $1 =DH8.3. The number of periods considered is 1'5 years.&#13;

Page 8 of 12&#13;
20.   Additional benefits, not included, would be generated from the the number of workers enrolled in&#13;
evening courses (from 4,000 in 1994 to at least 12,000 after 5 years), and the increase in the graduates'&#13;
salary due to the likely improvement in the quality and relevance of the training they received in the centers&#13;
of excellence. Moreover, it was assumed that training expenditures financed by the CSF scheme will be&#13;
discontinued after 3 years, whereas they are expected to increase after the promulgation of the in-service&#13;
training law, leading to an even higher IRR through reallocation of the VTT proceeds from the financing of&#13;
pre-service training to in-service training, which yields much higher returns. This last conservative&#13;
assumption is wvarranted by the institutional risk involved with the process of preparation and processing of&#13;
the law.&#13;

21.   The increases in value added resulting from a DHI,000 increase in training expenditures is the&#13;
single most important factor which determines the magnitude of the IRR. This increase may fall short of&#13;
(or exceed) the assumed value of DH516 used in the computation of the IRR due to diminishing (or&#13;
increasing) returns on training. The effect of such potential variations is shown in Figure 3 below for&#13;
increases in value added ranging from DH299 to DH815, corresponding respectively to the returns on&#13;
training expenditures for the smallest (least efficient) and largest (most efficient) enterprise size-groups.&#13;
Finally, any number of assumptions can be made about the number of period for which the effect of&#13;
training lasts and how fast it depreciates. The assumptions made for the IRR computation seem rather&#13;
conservative and a sensitivity analysis of the return to training to these assumptions is provided in Table 4&#13;
above.&#13;

C- The Development of a Least-cost Project Design&#13;
22.    The project addresses the need to upgrade the Moroccan labor force. Two types of investment in&#13;
vocational training could effectively upgrade the labor force: expanding the capacity, quality and relevance&#13;
of pre-service training or. alternatively, promoting in-service training on a demand-driven basis. This&#13;
project adopts the second alternative, which is the least-cost one, for many reasons. First, the Bank's&#13;
experience in financing the development of V.T. in Morocco clearly demonstrates that while quality pre-&#13;
service vocational training is expensive (it generates substantial recurrent costs), the potential for cost&#13;
recovery is low (see para. 1..12 of main text). This suggests that any expansion of pre-service training&#13;
would increase the Government budget burden and raises sustainability issues. Second, the utilization rate&#13;
of the vocational training facilities would be maximized under the proposed project. The VT centers would&#13;
have much more incentives to operate twelve months a year and in the evenings, offering in-service training&#13;
under contracts. Finally, there are clear signals suggesting that the labor market is currently over-saturated&#13;
by VT graduates. In contrast with in-service training, the rate of return estimates for pre-service VT&#13;
graduates are very low. These rates of return are estimated in Table 7 below for the three levels of&#13;
vocational graduates based on salary and employment information collected through the MVT's tracer&#13;
studies. They are very sensitive to the average wage of apprentices. The estimates shown in the table&#13;
below assume that apprentices are paid 30% below the minimum wage (SMIG). The rates of return would&#13;
be negative if the average wage of apprentices was equal to the SMIG, and slightly higher than what is&#13;
shown in the table if it was equivalent to 60% of the SMIG (which is the minimum permitted by the&#13;
Moroccan legislation.)&#13;

D - Fiscal Impact Analysis&#13;
23.    The project does not have any impact on the Government operating budget (see para. 3.07 of main&#13;
text.) The share of the project cost bome by the Govemment investment budget --including the Bank loan&#13;
but excluding the VT tax-- is US$67.7 million. This investment cost represents only 0.4% of the projected&#13;
Govermment's capital expenditures during the project duration. Because the project is part of the&#13;
Govenmment sector strategy, it will be financed through the MVT's regular resources and thus will not&#13;
require additional budget outlays.&#13;
24.    Furthermnore, a significant portion of the project investmnent cost would be recovered by the&#13;
Govermment budget through additional fiscal revenues:&#13;
*   whether the increase in the enterprises' value added generated by the project would accrue to&#13;
the workers or the shareholders, it is fair to assume that about 25% of this incremental value&#13;
added would return to the State through the income and corporate tax systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44 -                                   Annex 4&#13;
Page I1 of 12&#13;
*   similarly, the reduction in job search time of VT graduates would generate additional taxable&#13;
income, and thus fiscal revenues.&#13;
*   60%  of the resources generated by the centers of excellence from  sales of training and&#13;
counseling services to enterprises (Compte Hors Budget, CHB) are required to be reinvested&#13;
in the training centers, and thus would reduce proportionately the centers' future dependency&#13;
on public financing.&#13;
25.    These benefits compensate to a large extent for the project's budgetary impact. Moreover, with&#13;
adequate cost recovery policies the project has the potential to generate positive financial flows to the&#13;
Government's budget. The investment under the third component of the project improves the quality and&#13;
relevance of both the in-service and pre-service training programs of the centers of excellence. In-service&#13;
training would operate on a full cost recovery basis, and based on the improved job prospects of the centers&#13;
of excellence's students relative to students in "non-excellence" centers, the contribution of students to the&#13;
cost of their education would be entirely justified. Based on flow of costs and benefits to the state&#13;
mentioned in the above paragraphs, if only 25% of the average cost per student was recovered (about&#13;
US$470 a year per student,) the cumulated financial benefits from increased tax revenues and cost-&#13;
recovery would yield an IRR of 20% and a Net Present Value of US$14.5 million to the State. These&#13;
calculations are detailed in table 8 below, and figure 4 shows the sensitivity of the returns to the State in&#13;
relation with the rate of cost recovery. Assuming a discount rate for the State of 10%, Figure 4 shows that&#13;
the Net Present Value of the Project becomes positive when only 15% of pre-service training costs are&#13;
recovered.&#13;
26.   In summary, because the project leverages substantial resources from the private sector, its impact&#13;
on the Govemment capital expenditures is small and should be dealt with primarily through cost recovery.&#13;

KEY MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
A - Development Objective Indicators&#13;
1.    Impact assessment of the project would be conducted in the context of the project is two major&#13;
objectives: improve the skills of the workforce and increase enterprise competitiveness. The indicators&#13;
which would be monitored are: (i) labor productivity (output per worker), (ii) value added per worker, (iii)&#13;
improvement in real wages, and (iv) the percentage of firms that train by size of firms. Data would be&#13;
collected through the studies described in Annex 3, and more recent baseline data would be established&#13;
during the first year of the project when the first of the series of three surveys is undertaken. In addition,&#13;
the economic analyses of Annex 4 would be updated following each survey, in order to monitor the flow of&#13;
project benefits by estimating the increase in enterprises' value added resulting from the training activities&#13;
financed by the project.&#13;

            The objectives of the Third Private
            Sector Development Project for Morocco are to improve
            enterprise competitiveness, retrain the work force and
            upgrade its skills by: a) strengthening the capacity of
            professional associations and enterprises to define the
            skills they need to implement their business development
            strategies, with particular emphasis on micro- and
            small-sized enterprises; (b) introducing incentives for
            enterprises to develop in-service training; (c) promoting
            the responsiveness of selected public training centers which
            cater to the private sector; and (d) creating an adequate
            legal framework for the development of in-service training
            and strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry
            of Vocational Training (MVT). The project will have the
            following four components: (1) the promotion of demand for
            training; (2) the development of in-service training; (3)
            the emergence of centers of excellence; and (4)
