THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
SOCIAL REFORM AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:     The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
Amount:       SDR 9.0 Million&#13;
(US$ 14.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:         10 years grace and 35 years maturity&#13;
Project&#13;
Objectives:    The success of Macedonia's economic reform program will depend upon whether the&#13;
Borrower can deal effectively with the social dimensions of reform. The objective of&#13;
the proposed Social Reform and Technical Assistance Project is to support the&#13;
Borrower's reform program by: (a) facilitating the restructuring of socially owned&#13;
enterprises through actions to reduce the individual and community impacts of worker&#13;
dislocation, (b) improving the delivery of social benefits and the collection of payroll&#13;
contributions for social benefits, (c) improving public awareness of the rationale for&#13;
reform policies, and (d) supporting the continuing implementation of the enterprise&#13;
restructuring program.&#13;
Project&#13;
Description:   The project will be implemented over four years by the Agency for the&#13;
Transformation of Enterprises with Social Capital (Privatization Agency) in&#13;
cooperation with the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MOLSP), the State&#13;
Statistical Bureau, and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Project cost is estimated at&#13;
US$ 17.1 million equivalent including contingencies, local taxes and duties. The cost&#13;
includes consulting services, fellowships and training, furniture, equipment and&#13;
materials, vehicles, financial resources for a Labor Redeployment Fund, and&#13;
incremental operating costs generated by the investments. The project comprises four&#13;
components:&#13;
a. Labor Redeployment (US$ 10.9 million). This component will support the&#13;
redeployment of labor in communities affected by large-scale enterprise restructuring&#13;
by: (i) analyzing the labor requirements of socially-owned enterprises (SOEs) which&#13;
are undergoing restructuring or privatization, (ii) providing pre-layoff adjustment&#13;
services to workers in SOEs scheduled for downsizing or liquidation, (iii) providing&#13;
post-layoff services' to the displaced workers, through a Labor Redeployment Fund,&#13;
to accelerate their return to productive employment, (iv) strengthening Employment&#13;
Bureau services for job seekers, and (v) establishing a Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) to support overall project implementation.&#13;
i/     These include programs for employment counseling and job placement, relocation, retraining, small business assistance, and local&#13;
economic development planning, but exclude severance payments which are financed separately through the Government's Special&#13;
Restructuring Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
b. Public Information Program (US$ 1.4 million). This component will support the&#13;
development of public media information programs to build public support for the&#13;
country's economic reform program. It will do this by: (i) creating a Media&#13;
Coordinating Unit in the Privatization Agency to oversee the public information&#13;
program, (ii) conducting surveys to assess public knowledge and opinion on economic&#13;
reform issues to guide the development of an effective public information program,&#13;
and (iii) developing and carrying out a public media program to inform the public of&#13;
the rationale for specific reform measures.&#13;
c. Social Benefit Programs (US$ 2.4 million). This component will help develop&#13;
more equitable, efficient, and financially sustainable social benefit programs by: (i)&#13;
developing objective poverty criteria as a basis for targeting social assistance, (ii)&#13;
developing actuarially-based pension planning, and (iii) improving payroll tax&#13;
collection by improving business registration procedures and strengthening audit and&#13;
enforcement controls.&#13;
d. Enterprise Restructuring Technical Assistance (US$ 2.4 million). This component&#13;
would provide technical assistance to: (i) establish a Trustee Unit at the Privatization&#13;
Agency to manage enterprise restructuring, (ii) accelerate privatization of viable SOEs&#13;
and liquidation of non-viable SOEs, (iii) impose stringent financial controls on&#13;
external resources provided to enterprises from the state budget or the banking&#13;
system, and (iv) identify the post-privatization technical assistance needs of SOEs.&#13;
Benefits:     The major benefit expected from the proposed project would be to foster public&#13;
acceptance of the country's economic reform program, thus helping ensure the&#13;
sustainability of the reform program. In addition, labor redeployment activities&#13;
supported by the project would help reduce public budgetary outlays and increase&#13;
national output by moving workers from jobs where they are not productive, and&#13;
receive public subsidies, to jobs where they are more productive. The employment&#13;
effect of some labor redeployment programns (i.e. training) may be reduced to some&#13;
extent if workers who benefit from the programs displace other workers. However,&#13;
even in these cases, the programs should contribute to increased productivity. The&#13;
project would also help restore long-run fiscal balance by improving tax collections&#13;
and by establishing a more equitable, efficient, and affordable basis for pensions and&#13;
social assistance.&#13;
Risks:        The principal risk associated with the proposed project is that a failure to impose a&#13;
hard budget constraint could permit further delays in real restructuring of the largest&#13;
loss-making enterprises, including needed labor shedding, thereby undermining the&#13;
basis for the project. The proposed FESAC and follow-up policy oversight expected&#13;
under subsequent operations would reduce this risk to an acceptable level. Moreover,&#13;
because the project is viewed by Borrower authorities as a pre-requisite to effective&#13;
enterprise reform, the project itself would help to mitigate this risk. However, in the&#13;
event that there are substantial delays or changes in the FESAC, that affect the special&#13;
restructuring program, the configuration of the project would need to be reconsidered&#13;
because is it specifically designed to support the special restructuring program.&#13;
Finally, the implementation capacity of some of the agencies involved is weak. The&#13;
project addresses this issue by providing technical assistance and requiring the&#13;
agencies to add small numbers of staff to support project implementation.&#13;

THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
SOCIAL REFORM AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1           In this fourth year of political independence, the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia faces a particularly difficult challenge: the transformation to a market economy in a&#13;
situation of extraordinary economic isolation. In parallel with the loss of markets in the former&#13;
Soviet bloc after 1989, the disintegration of Yugoslavia profoundly changed the environment in which&#13;
the enterprise sector operated. United Nations sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro brought&#13;
about a loss of the country's largest export market. In addition, the closure of the border with&#13;
Greece, its main trade route to the sea, limited access to alternative markets and increased the cost of&#13;
imported goods. As a result of these external events, gross social product (GSP)' has declined to&#13;
less than half its 1989 level, and unemployment has risen to approximately 30 percent of the labor&#13;
force.2&#13;
1.2           In 1992, the Borrower embarked on a stabilization and economic reform program,&#13;
which includes privatization of socially-owned enterprises (SOEs). In spite of the difficulties&#13;
associated with the collapse of external markets and imposed economic isolation, the Borrower&#13;
remains committed to this program. Under the first Economic Recovery Loan (ERL 1),3 the&#13;
Borrower adopted a new privatization law, and established the Agency for Privatization of Enterprises&#13;
with Social Capital (Privatization Agency) to assist enterprises in preparing restructuring plans and to&#13;
oversee the privatization of SOEs. As part of its Special Restructuring Program, the Privatization&#13;
Agency has identified 25 enterprises to be restructured or privatized on a priority basis. These 25&#13;
enterprises4 account for about four-fifths of losses in the enterprise sector in 1993 and currently&#13;
employ 56,700 workers -- about 13 percent of formal employment in the country. A parallel&#13;
Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (FESAC) will support policy reform in the&#13;
enterprise, banking and social sectors. Policy goals to be supported in the social sectors include: (a)&#13;
facilitating the transfer of labor from SOEs to new employment opportunities, (b) reforming the social&#13;
assistance system in an effort to make it sustainable and to improve employment incentives, and (c)&#13;
assisting the Pension Fund to be financially self sufficient.&#13;
1.3           While the FESAC establishes an appropriate policy setting for the enterprise&#13;
restructuring program, specific investments will be needed in several areas to implement the program.&#13;
1/     Gross Social Product is defined as the sum of national income and depreciation of the capital stock,&#13;
where national income is the value added of goods produced in the 'productive sector' (e.g. agriculture,&#13;
manufacturing, etc). GSP, unlike GDP, (i) does not include value added from services, and (ii) does not deduct&#13;
the costs of services in calculating the value added of goods produced in the economy.&#13;
2/     In July 1994, 195,000 individuals out of an active labor force of about 640,000 were registered as&#13;
unemployed at the National Employment Bureau.&#13;
3/     Loan 3703-MK and Credit 2564-MK, both approved on February 8, 1994.&#13;
4/     This includes 20 industrial enterprises and 3 agro-enterprises, plus one power utility and one railway.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
First, the Borrower recognizes that labor redundancy is pervasive,5 but managers of the largest&#13;
enterprises and key Government officials are unwilling to proceed with large-scale labor shedding&#13;
unless targeted labor redeployment programs are established to assist the workers and communities&#13;
where labor shedding occurs. Second, public support for the transition is threatened by rising&#13;
unemployment, deteriorating living conditions, uncertainty about the political and economic future,&#13;
and public confusion about the rationale for specific reform policies. Public support for reform will&#13;
require better public awareness of the reasons why the Borrower is pursuing specific reform policies.&#13;
Third, because of high unemployment and sharply declining real wages, many families face the&#13;
prospect of poverty unless income support programs are maintained, yet the Borrower is finding it&#13;
increasingly difficult to maintain these programs in the face of a shrinking tax base and increasing&#13;
demand for benefits.6 Fourth, while initial cost-cutting plans have been developed for 25 of the&#13;
largest loss-making SOEs, there is a need for supplementary technical assistance in order to help the&#13;
SOEs implement these plans.'&#13;
5/     An August, 1994 survey of 25 large SOEs indicates that managers expect that one-third of staff will be&#13;
displaced during restructuring.&#13;
6/     Expenditures for social transfers and services, including unemployment benefits, social assistance,&#13;
social insurance, and child allowances, now consume one fourth of GSP.&#13;
7/     Completion of the enterprise restructuring program is a second tranche condition of the proposed&#13;
FESAC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
II. SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Restructuring Program for Socially-owned Enterprises&#13;
2.1             The socially owned and mixed ownership sector is comprised of 1,856 enterprises8&#13;
employing 324,000 workers (53 percent of all formal sector employees), primarily in the trade,&#13;
construction, agricultural, and textile sectors.9   Overstaffing and redundancy are pervasive in these&#13;
enterprises. For example, an August 1994 survey of 25 large SOEs indicates that managers expect at&#13;
least one-third of their workers to be laid off during restructuring.&#13;
2.2            The former Yugoslavia introduced legislation in 1989 for the transformation of social&#13;
ownership (the Law on Social Capital). However, implementation was not well regulated and was&#13;
accompanied by abuses. As a consequence, the Borrower stopped all privatization and introduced the&#13;
Law for Transformation of Socially-Owned Enterprises in June 1993 (the Privatization Law). Under&#13;
the law, the Borrower targeted 1,468 enterprises for privatization; about half are socially owned and&#13;
half are mixed ownership enterprises. One hundred are large; 299 are medium; and 1,069 are&#13;
small.'" In total, they represent 79 percent of all socially owned and mixed ownership enterprises, 78&#13;
percent of SOE employment, and 53 percent of SOE assets. Eventually, most of the other SOEs must&#13;
also be privatized, with similar labor redeployment consequences.&#13;
2.3            At the same time, the private sector is making a growing contribution to economic&#13;
activity. At the end of February 1994, approximately 17,000 private sector enterprises were active in&#13;
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The number of registered self-employed persons (and&#13;
their employees) increased from 15,219 in 1990 to 36,182 in 1993." While the majority of private&#13;
sector companies operate in services and trade, socially owned and mixed enterprises are concentrated&#13;
in production of iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, textiles, footwear and tobacco.&#13;
2.4            While many large enterprises have stopped paying wages with the collapse of product&#13;
markets, they have generally not dismissed any of their redundant workers, many of whom continue&#13;
8/     The Privatization Agency uses a figure of 1,856 enterprises -- 1,019 socially owned and 837 mixed&#13;
ownership -- and does not count subsidiaries as separate enterprises. Some other government agencies use a&#13;
slightly higher figure, counting individual subsidiaries as separate enterprises.&#13;
9/     See Annex II for a profile of employment by sector.&#13;
10/    According to the Law for Transformation, small enterprises are defined as those which meet at least&#13;
two of the following criteria: having (i) less than 50 employees, (ii) annual corporate income of less than 8,000&#13;
times the average monthly wage in the economy, and (iii) average assets of less than 6,000 times the average&#13;
monthly wage in the economy. For medium enterprises, the criteria are: having (i) less than 250 employees,&#13;
(ii) corporate income less than 40,000 times average monthly wage in the economy, and (iii) assets of less than&#13;
30,000 times the average monthly wage in the economy. All others are defined as large enterprises.&#13;
11/    This figure peaked at 38,698 in 1991, at least according to official statistics. It is probable, however,&#13;
that informal unregistered economic activity - and employment - outside the formal sector continues to grow but&#13;
is not reflected in official figures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
to collect wages, or, more typically, to accumulate lOUs from their employers. The retention of&#13;
redundant labor is inefficient because it delays the reallocation of labor to alternative productive&#13;
employment, thus lowering labor productivity, increasing enterprise losses, and impeding enterprise&#13;
restructuring. While the retention of redundant labor may reflect the unwillingness of enterprise&#13;
managers to inflict higher rates of unemployment on their communities, it may also represent a&#13;
rational response to prevailing employment and social benefit policies. For example, layoffs are&#13;
deterred by laws requiring employers to give six months notice and provide up to 12 months of&#13;
severance pay to dismissed workers (in addition to back wages), as well as by a provision that poor&#13;
households headed by an employed worker receive higher social assistance benefits than equally poor&#13;
households whose head is not employed.&#13;
2.5           The Borrower has established a Special Restructuring Program (SRP) to deal with 25&#13;
large politically sensitive loss-making enterprises which include 20 industrial and 3 agro-enterprises,&#13;
plus the national railways and the national electric power utility. These enterprises represent about 10&#13;
percent of formal sector employment. With the help of bilateral consultants, diagnostic studies have&#13;
already been carried out for each of the enterprises and loss-reduction plans have been adopted,&#13;
including, where applicable, general plans for large-scale labor shedding.&#13;
2.6           Under the Special Restructuring Program and the FESAC, the Borrower will adopt a&#13;
number of measures to strengthen enterprise management and impose financial discipline. The 23&#13;
industrial and agro-enterprises will be given up to one year to demonstrate that they can generate a&#13;
positive operating cash flow (before debt service payments). During this time, they will benefit from&#13;
a moratorium on debt service payments to banks, but they will be forced to run on a cash basis and&#13;
will not be permitted to increase their arrears to creditors. They will also have no further access to&#13;
bank credits for either investments or general working capital requirements. However, on an&#13;
exceptional basis, they will be able to obtain self-liquidating trade credits if these are needed in order&#13;
to fill specific firm and profitable orders from creditworthy customers. Limited amounts of funds&#13;
from the budget will be made available to cover temporary cash shortages for working capital.&#13;
Enterprises which cannot come forward with self-financing business plans (including self-liquidating&#13;
credits) will be subjected to further cost cutting/downsizing measures or liquidation. Enterprises&#13;
which succeed in operating on a positive cash flow basis will be eligible for financial restructuring,&#13;
including debt to equity swaps. The two utilities will be restructured with a focus on improving cost-&#13;
efficiency, reducing excess labor costs, and dispensing with non-core activities (e.g., guest houses) as&#13;
an initial step in a long-term rationalization of their activities. It is the Borrower's intention that all&#13;
of the 23 industrial and agro-enterprises will either have undergone or have entered the process of&#13;
privatization or liquidation by the completion of the Special Reform Program.&#13;
2.7            To ensure that the rules of the SRP are followed and that cost-reduction plans are&#13;
implemented, the enterprises will be placed in the receivership of a Trustee Unit reporting to a special&#13;
interninisterial committee, chaired by the Minister of Economy, located at the Privatization Agency,&#13;
and supported by a team of sectoral advisers and other support staff. The Trustee will be vested with&#13;
the full rights of ownership of the enterprises, with full legal and fiduciary powers -- including the&#13;
power to remove and replace non-performing enterprise managers and to control the cash flow of&#13;
enterprises. The Privatization Agency has obtained some expertise from several bilateral donors&#13;
(including Japan and the USA) plus assistance from volunteer agencies to help establish the Trustee&#13;
Unit and to provide assistance, including shadow managers, to SOEs. However, during appraisal, the&#13;
Borrower requested that additional financing for technical assistance be added to the Social Reform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
and Technical Assistance Project to ensure that there are sufficient resources to establish the Trustee&#13;
Unit, and provide shadow managers for all 25 enterprises.&#13;
B. Labor RcdeDlovment&#13;
2.8           Labor redeployment has three distinct and mutually reinforcing phases. First, an&#13;
analysis needs to be carried out to define the labor and social assets to be divested during enterprise&#13;
restructuring. Second, pre-layoff assistance needs to be provided within the respective enterprises to&#13;
advise workers of alternative income support and employment options. Third, post-layoff services&#13;
need to be provided to displaced workers, based on the demand identified during the pre-layoff phase.&#13;
The status of labor redeployment under these three phases in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia is described below.&#13;
2.9           Analysis of Enterprise Labor Requirements. The development of revised labor force&#13;
requirements at the enterprise level is one of the first steps that should be taken in the process of&#13;
enterprise restructuring. This analysis should occur in parallel with the development of revised&#13;
financial and business plans for the SOEs because excess labor is one of the key issues that must be&#13;
addressed in developing these plans. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, determining the&#13;
labor requirements for individual enterprises has been hindered by a lack of information regarding the&#13;
qualifications, skills and characteristics of workers and the qualifications and skill profiles that are&#13;
needed by the enterprise. This deficiency is exacerbated by the reluctance of SOE managers to deal&#13;
with the concept of layoffs and redeployment, in part because they lack the knowledge and resources&#13;
to assist displaced workers.&#13;
2.10          At this first stage of analysis, revised labor force specifications provide general&#13;
information about the number of workers affected by restructuring, including their skill levels and&#13;
demographic characteristics. Existing and optimal staffing levels are compared, based on revised&#13;
financial and business plans, but specific workers to be affected are not yet identified. The initial&#13;
enterprise-level analysis would include current labor force profiles, as well as information on the&#13;
divestiture of social infrastructure. While SOEs in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia do&#13;
not generally provide housing, schools, or clinics for their employees, other social assets -- including&#13;
farms, vacation villages, hotels, and shops -- are candidates for privatization.&#13;
2.11          Pre-lavoff assistance. Once a formal decision is made to restructure an enterprise,&#13;
individual redundant workers must be identified and given advance notice. Immediate pre-layoff&#13;
assistance should be provided at the enterprise level, which will serve to reduce labor-management&#13;
conflicts and social tensions, as well as communicate valuable information concerning post-layoff&#13;
options and services. Pre-layoff assistance should include information about alternative employment&#13;
opportunities within the enterprise, employment opportunities outside the enterprise, eligibility for&#13;
income support programs, and the purpose and availability of active labor market programs, such as&#13;
small business assistance, public works opportunities, and retraining, all aimed at accelerating the&#13;
return of displaced workers to productive employment.&#13;
2.12          At present, no public or private group provides systematic assistance prior to layoffs.&#13;
SOEs have managed labor force adjustments through "soft reductions," including the use of voluntary&#13;
retirement, "forced holidays", laying off of problem employees, and provision of severance pay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
International experience'2 indicates, however, that successful labor force adjustment programs should&#13;
distribute the responsibility for redeploying workers among the State and other social partners,&#13;
including unions, enterprises, and the communities. These techniques are most effective when&#13;
assistance is provided during the period of advance notice, prior to actual layoff.&#13;
2.13          Post-layoff services. The state's interest in providing post-layoff services is to&#13;
facilitate the transition to alternative productive employment and reduce pressure on the public&#13;
budget. After layoffs occur, workers will adjust to their new situation in a variety of ways. Some&#13;
workers will find other jobs rapidly, while others may decide to exit the labor market, retiring or&#13;
staying at home with their families. Many laid-off workers are likely to apply for income support&#13;
payments, such as unemployment insurance and social assistance. Some may also request and benefit&#13;
from in-depth counseling and employment services to help them locate alternative employment, or&#13;
from public works employment. Displaced workers whose skills are not in demand may benefit from&#13;
retraining. Relocation assistance may be useful if jobs are more plentiful in other localities.&#13;
Development of small businesses may also be a viable alternative for some displaced workers.&#13;
2.14          In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the National Employment Bureau,&#13;
which operates 30 local employment bureaus, is the public agency charged with providing assistance&#13;
to the unemployed, particularly through the administration of unemployment benefits. (See Annex III&#13;
for information about the configuration of local offices.) The Employment Bureau maintains a job&#13;
vacancy registry, matches job seekers with job vacancies, administers the unemployment benefit&#13;
program and provides a limited number of other services for the unemployed. It facilitates only&#13;
limited re-training for the unemployed, contracting through existing training institutions. About 800&#13;
(0.4 percent) people were re-trained in 1994 -- a figure that is considerably lower than the 5 to 10&#13;
percent of labor force retraining found in many OECD and CEE countries. Employment Bureau&#13;
staff are primarily occupied with processing unemployment benefits, and have little time to help the&#13;
unemployed find or prepare themselves for new jobs."3&#13;
2.15          The Employment Bureau currently lacks the financial and human resources to improve&#13;
or expand on existing services. It lacks the trained staff and appropriate materials required to offer&#13;
up-to-date job placement and counseling services, or to organize retraining and other active labor&#13;
market programs. Similarly, resources are not available to offer pre-layoff, in-plant services, nor to&#13;
organize a broader array of post-layoff services in communities affected by large-scale layoffs.&#13;
Furthermore, the staff to client ratio at the Employment Bureau, at 1 to 525, is considerably less than&#13;
the 1 to 100 ratio commonly found in OECD countries, where labor redeployment services reflect the&#13;
needs of a market economy. 14&#13;
12/    Examples include the Canadian Industrial Adjustment Service, the Treuhaund in Eastern Germany, and&#13;
British Coal.&#13;
13/    The Bureau does provide a job vacancy registry. The ratio of vacancies to job seekers is currently&#13;
around I to 20. However, this ratio, the unemployment rate, and the staff-to-client ratio should be interpreted&#13;
with caution. A large share of "job-seekers' have been registered for many years and may either be working,&#13;
have other sources of income, or have left the labor market. For example, in 1992, about half of those on the&#13;
unemployment rolls had been registered for over three years.&#13;
14/    E.g., I to 9 in Sweden, 1 to 120 in Portugal, and I to 375 in Turkey (which does not have an&#13;
unemployment benefit system to administer).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.16          In summary, the need for labor redeployment services is accentuated by the structural&#13;
changes in employment that will result from changing patterns of ownership, changes in the size and&#13;
sectoral distribution of employment, and by the increased emphasis on SOE productivity. Since&#13;
enterprise restructuring can affect many workers at once, labor redeployment assistance should be&#13;
directly linked to the privatization process and tailored to sectoral and geographic circumstances.&#13;
Enterprises need to analyze the impact of restructuring on their labor force, provide pre-layoff&#13;
assistance in consultation with community and labor representatives, and organize post-layoff services&#13;
for displaced workers, using local service providers.&#13;
C. Public Information&#13;
2.17          The human impact of structural reform in transition economies is prone to create&#13;
public dissatisfaction, nostalgia for the previous system, and the sentiment that the market economy is&#13;
responsible for unfulfilled expectations of the transition. This situation in turn, tends to erode public&#13;
support for economic reforms, which further reduces their chances of success. These trends are&#13;
evident in several former planned economies -- including Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Russia,&#13;
where communist or socialist parties have made strong showings in recent elections. Should public&#13;
opinion change in a similar direction in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Borrower's&#13;
economic reform program could face insurmountable opposition.&#13;
2.18          Little information is currently available on public attitudes towards the emerging&#13;
market economy and the Borrower's continuing program of structural economic change. Until&#13;
recently, no Ministry has been fully cognizant of the need to monitor and inform public opinion,&#13;
although, in theory, the Ministry of Information might have been expected to perform this function.&#13;
That Ministry has not functioned effectively for some time, however, having no top-level Ministerial&#13;
appointment and no clear statement of mission.&#13;
2.19          The Privatization Agency, in recognizing the need for effective, interactive public&#13;
communication in the context of the privatization program, has taken the lead in developing a Public&#13;
Information Campaign. As a first step, the Agency has engaged a private firm to create an&#13;
advertising campaign aimed at improving public understanding of the enterprise privatization&#13;
program. Subsequent steps taken by the Privatization Agency include employing an international&#13;
public relations expert, and providing for training of the Director of the Agency's Public Relations&#13;
Center at a six-week external training program. 15&#13;
2.20          Mass media campaigns have played an important role worldwide in social and&#13;
political reforms undertaken by governmental and international organizations (UN, UNESCO,&#13;
UNICEF, etc.). A variety of mass media techniques, including public relations, media events, and&#13;
advertising campaigns, have been used to gain public support for, and involvement in, a broad range&#13;
of issues. For example, successful campaigns have been waged to help alleviate hunger in Somalia,&#13;
to promote family planning in developing countries, to encourage breast feeding worldwide, and to&#13;
reduce drug and tobacco abuse in western countries. Furthermore, indications are that the impact of&#13;
media on public opinion in the former Yugoslavia has been significant during the past several years.&#13;
15/    These latter two activities are financed by USAID.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
A media campaign to support the labor redeployment effort should be launched if the country's&#13;
economic reform program is to gain the public support which it requires for success.&#13;
D. Social Benefit Programs&#13;
2.21          Several income support and poverty prevention programs, including unemployment&#13;
benefits, social assistance and social insurance systems, are already in place. The financial viability&#13;
of these systems -- in particular, the social assistance and social insurance systems -- is being strained&#13;
as the demand for assistance increases and the contribution base shrinks. There is an immediate need&#13;
to launch preparatory activities to make social benefit programs more equitable, more efficient, and&#13;
more financially sustainable in the new economic context.&#13;
Social Assistance&#13;
2.22          The decline in economic activity and its potentially adverse impact on household&#13;
welfare led the Borrower in 1992 to establish a means-tested social assistance system.'6 The program&#13;
has many positive attributes. It has delivered social assistance benefits to a rapidly increasing number&#13;
of clients. The number of beneficiary households has increased dramatically, from 9,000 in 1992 to&#13;
nearly 50,000 in 1994. The program has also established social minima (para. 2.23), which take into&#13;
account household assets, and has attempted to maintain work incentives in the system. However, an&#13;
analysis of the social assistance system suggests that the program could benefit from improvements in&#13;
five areas:&#13;
(a)    Fiscal solvency. Existing benefit levels and eligibility criteria, which provide too&#13;
much for too many recipients, have contributed to the fiscal unsustainability of the&#13;
program. In September 1994, the Borrower was two months in arrears in making&#13;
social assistance benefit payments.&#13;
(b)    Work incentives. The program contains disincentives to work. Benefit levels are too&#13;
high and initial earnings from work are effectively taxed at 100 percent.&#13;
(c)    Equity. Households are not treated equitably in the system.  The current social&#13;
minima do not accurately reflect the different consumption needs of different&#13;
households.&#13;
(d)    Program integration. The system is not well integrated with other social welfare&#13;
programs. Parallel programs such as child allowances pursue similar objectives&#13;
through different means, and are not adequately reflected in the design of social&#13;
assistance.&#13;
(e)    Targeting effectiveness. The use of an average, rather than a minimum, consumption&#13;
basket as the basis for social assistance eligibility makes the social assistance program&#13;
ineffective in targeting the very poor. The basket is not adjusted for non-food or&#13;
minimum nutritional requirements, nor for rural/urban or regional price differences.&#13;
16/    See Annex IV for a detailed description of the social assistance program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.23          To transform the social welfare program into a system that equitably and efficiently&#13;
targets the poor, the Borrower needs to establish a poverty line based on a minimum consumption&#13;
basket. This poverty line could be the basic foundation for: (a) identifying and targeting the poorest&#13;
households in the economy and thereby improving equity; (b) establishing social assistance minimum&#13;
benefits and making them consistent across cash benefit systems; and (c) maintaining work incentives&#13;
in the program that are critical to the functioning of a market economy.&#13;
2.24          Identification of the poor, and policy changes to improve efficiency and equity within&#13;
the system, can only have the desired impact if responsible Government institutions have the&#13;
administrative and management skills to effectively deliver benefits to the poor. In the past, Social&#13;
Assistance Offices served as counseling centers for the "socially handicapped population". The&#13;
means-tested social assistance program was superimposed on this system without any significant&#13;
accompanying changes in the staffing, administrative capacity, information flows, enforcement&#13;
mechanisms and physical capital requirements of the system. Although the staff to client ratio for the&#13;
whole program has decreased from 1/35 to 1/77, it remains reasonable by OECD standards. But the&#13;
distribution of staff does not match the distribution of clients across districts. 17 The system is not&#13;
well-linked to other cash benefit program delivery points, such as employment offices and child&#13;
allowance centers, and the regional and head offices of the social assistance program are not well&#13;
integrated. Visits to Social Assistance Offices and discussions with Ministry of Labor officials&#13;
suggest that these institutional constraints have created: (a) difficulties in verifying claims, (b) delays&#13;
in claim processing, (c) inadequate monitoring of recipients, and (d) limited enforcement of&#13;
regulations. These problems are particularly acute in areas where the recent increase in claims has&#13;
been most dramatic. An in-depth evaluation of the system could help the Borrower assess what&#13;
measures are required to improve the system.&#13;
Actuarial Analysis of Pensions&#13;
2.25          Deficits in the pension and disability insurance program threaten both the Borrower's&#13;
budget and future pension payments. The program provides old-age, survivors' and disability&#13;
pensions that are related to earnings and years of service. The pay-as-you-go pension fund is&#13;
financed primarily by a 20 percent payroll tax on wages'8. The Borrower needs to be able to project&#13;
future payroll tax revenues (para. 2.31) and pension expenditures so as to control fund finances and&#13;
place the fund in financial balance.&#13;
2.26          The Pension Fund is currently in deficit'9 because of increased expenditure obligations&#13;
and dwindling revenues. This situation occurred, in part, because in the initial years of the transition,&#13;
the Borrower encouraged early retirement as a solution to labor force redundancy. As a result, the&#13;
Pension Fund lost 85,000 contributing wage-earners, while the number of new pensioners rose by&#13;
70,000. Approximately one-third of these new pensioners were early retirees on full pensions.&#13;
17/    See Annex IV for a summary of local office staffing.&#13;
18/    Farmers' contributions are based on imputed income related to land valuation.&#13;
19/    The Fund's deficit was MKD 3.3 billion in 1994, equivalent to 0.9 percent of GSP. In the absence of&#13;
reform measures, the deficit is projected to rise to MKD 2.0 billion, or about 1.1 percent of GSP, in 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2.27          In 1994, changes in the pension law sought to improve this adverse financial situation&#13;
through a series of measures. Early retirement and early retirement buyouts were ended; the pension&#13;
age was increased for some pensioners; the maximum replacement rate was reduced; some non-&#13;
pension expenditures were transferred to the State budget, and the payroll tax was raised from 18 to&#13;
20 percent. In addition, legislation was enacted which restricts pension indexing in 1994 to a rate less&#13;
than that of inflation. Together, these changes are credited with maintaining current benefit payment&#13;
delays at two to three months instead of the five-month backlog that would have occurred without the&#13;
legislation.&#13;
2.28          Nonetheless, projections by the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, the&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank indicate that revenues are not expected to&#13;
cover expenditures in 1994 or 1995, despite the current restrictive indexing procedures and an&#13;
infusion of funds from excise taxes. One way to control the 1995 deficit would be to continue some&#13;
degree of restrictive indexing in 1995. Yet this solution would adversely affect the standard of living&#13;
of pensioners at the minimum -- possibly forcing these individuals into poverty. Furthermore, this&#13;
would represent only a short-run solution to a longer-term issue. In the longer run, demographic&#13;
patterns resulting from improved mortality and lower birth rates are likely to lead to an aging&#13;
population that will require still greater government resources by the next century. This situation may&#13;
be exacerbated if the economy expands more slowly than expected in the long run.&#13;
2.29          In light of the high payroll tax rate, problematic payroll tax collection, and continuing&#13;
infusions of revenue from the budget, changes in the basic benefit structure will be required to&#13;
achieve fiscal sustainability. The Borrower will need to take measures to change pension entitlement,&#13;
which may include changes in: a) the age of benefit eligibility, b) the number of contribution years, c)&#13;
the benefit formula, d) indexing procedures, or e) the substitution of a defined-contribution, funded&#13;
tier of benefits for a portion of the pension payments which are currently provided under the defined-&#13;
benefit, pay-as-you-go public pension program.&#13;
2.30          Sound long-term policy requires an actuarial assessment of the pension system that&#13;
can help the Borrower to analyze the impact of different policy prescriptions on the Pension Fund's&#13;
future financial status. Furthermore, an ongoing program of actuarial analysis is needed to routinely&#13;
project Pension Fund balances under different economic assumptions to determine the sensitivity of&#13;
fund balances to more and less favorable economic conditions. The current projection capabilities&#13;
available to the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund are limited, projecting fund balances only one&#13;
year ahead. Assistance is needed to establish an actuarial capacity within the Pension and Disability&#13;
Insurance Fund to assess the impact of demographic and economic factors on future pension&#13;
obligations. An actuarial model is also needed to simulate the impact of specific policy changes on&#13;
the Fund's financial balance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
Payroll Tax Compliance&#13;
2.31           Old-age, disability and survivors' pensions, health insurance, and unemployment&#13;
benefits' are funded primarily through payroll tax contributions levied on wages.2' These taxes,&#13;
which currently total about 30 percent of net wages, are collected monthly at the time wage payments&#13;
are made to employees. The high payroll tax rate encourages tax evasion and promotes informal&#13;
sector activity by creating incentives to underreport wages. The result is lower payroll tax payments&#13;
and reduced government revenues. If payroll tax revenue is diminished, payments for pensions,&#13;
health insurance, and unemployment benefits cannot be sustained.&#13;
2.32           Since 1989, increased pension obligations and declining revenues have created a&#13;
deficit in the pension fund despite a substantial influx of funds from the budget. Current tax losses&#13;
are perceived to stem from three sources: (a) delayed wage payments by socially-owned enterprises,&#13;
resulting in delayed payroll tax contributions; (b) the failure of private-sector employers to register&#13;
their business activities and make payroll and other tax contributions; and (c) the misrepresentation of&#13;
wages by private-sector employers and subsequent underpayment of payroll tax contributions. While&#13;
revenue shortfall is not the sole source of the current fiscal deficit, poor private sector compliance&#13;
will increasingly jeopardize pension fund balances as employment shifts away from socially-owned&#13;
enterprises and towards the private sector.&#13;
2.33           Current collection procedures require that all enterprises, companies, and self-&#13;
employed individuals conducting business activities register their businesses and make all payments to&#13;
suppliers, employees, and the fiscal authorities through accounts held with the Bureau of Payment&#13;
Operations.22 Payroll tax contributions and wage disbursements are made simultaneously. In general,&#13;
socially owned enterprises operate in full compliance, unless their wages are in arrears or made&#13;
through in-kind payments. By contrast, private sector employers may avoid payroll tax obligations by&#13;
limiting wage payments made through the Bureau of Payment Operations (substituting cash or in-kind&#13;
benefits) or by simply not registering their business. To date, this type of under-reporting has not&#13;
been well-controlled.&#13;
2.34           To address these issues, there is a need to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of&#13;
current procedures to collect payroll tax contributions and to develop a set of recommendations to&#13;
enhance revenue collection. Yet payroll tax collection cannot be considered on a stand-alone basis in&#13;
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Unlike many Eastern European countries, the Pension&#13;
and Disability Insurance Fund does not operate a separate contributions collection mechanism.&#13;
20/    The Employment Fund provides financing for unemployment compensation, training, and&#13;
reimbursement for relocation. The Fund is created from a 1.5 percent payroll tax and was in approximate&#13;
equilibrium in December 1994. The level of benefits is tied to previous wages, but in fact 90 percent of the&#13;
unemployed receive a flat rate benefit of 80 percent of the minimum wage. The maximum duration is 24&#13;
months.&#13;
21/    Pension and disability insurance is financed by a 20 percent payroll tax on wages (although farmers'&#13;
contributions are based on imputed income related to land valuation). Health insurance is financed through a&#13;
8.6 percent payroll tax.&#13;
22/    Self-employed persons may use commercial banks for this purpose. In the future, other businesses will&#13;
be permitted to transfer their business accounts to commercial banks as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Payroll tax collection is the responsibility of the Public Revenue Office which also collects income&#13;
and profit taxes. Personal income taxes are withheld in conjunction with wage payments, in the same&#13;
manner as payroll tax contributions. Consequently, when wages are under-reported, both personal&#13;
income taxes and payroll contributions are reduced as well. Furthermore, non-compliance in business&#13;
registration not only reduces payroll tax contributions, but reduces the revenue from profit taxes and&#13;
income taxes. For these reasons, the issue of payroll tax compliance is intertwined with other areas&#13;
of taxation. Remedial action must address payroll tax compliance in conjunction with the broader tax&#13;
system.&#13;
E. IDA's Role and StrateEv&#13;
2.35          Successful enterprise restructuring in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will&#13;
require effective programs to ease the social costs of large-scale layoffs. Public support for this and&#13;
other aspects of the country's economic reform program will also require better public understanding&#13;
of the reasons for specific reform measures. The project actions to mitigate the social impacts of&#13;
reform are, in this sense, a cost of building political support for the country's economic reform&#13;
program. The Bank Group is well suited to assist in developing these actions because of its&#13;
experience with similar programs in other countries in the region, and because of its involvement in&#13;
other aspects of the country's economic reform program. The current retention of surplus labor&#13;
lowers labor productivity, increases enterprise losses, impedes enterprise restructuring, delays the&#13;
potential reallocation of labor to productive alternative employment, and consumes state budget&#13;
resources in the form of direct or indirect subsidies.'2 The basic rationale is that moving workers&#13;
from jobs where they are not productive and receive public subsidies to jobs where they are&#13;
productive and do not receive public subsidies reduces public budget outlays and increases national&#13;
output. Public budget outlays will decline to the extent that redundant workers who are to be&#13;
redeployed to new jobs now receive direct or indirect government subsidies, as many do. Even if&#13;
displaced workers are not successful in finding productive jobs, public budget outlays will decline if,&#13;
as is expected, the costs of labor redeployment measures, including income support, are less than the&#13;
cost of subsidies to keep workers in unproductive jobs. At the same time, national output will&#13;
increase to the extent that the jobs filled by redeployed workers are new jobs or higher productivity&#13;
jobs than they would otherwise have been.24&#13;
2.36          The proposed project directly supports the FESAC and is consistent with the draft&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which are being processed in parallel with the project. The&#13;
proposed project supports social reforms defined in the CAS including establishing new poverty lines&#13;
and poverty monitoring systems and facilitating labor redeployment. The project has been prepared&#13;
in coordination with bilateral and multilateral donors (Sweden, USAID, and the EU). Project design&#13;
reflects the recommendation of the June 1994 Consultative Group Meeting.&#13;
23/    Workers in loss-making socially-owned enterprises receive direct and indirect public subsidies in the&#13;
form of subsidized wages, other subsidized inputs, subsidies to the banking system, and inter-enterprise arrears.&#13;
The total cost of these subsidies typically exceeds by a significant margin the combined cost of unemployment&#13;
benefits, social assistance, and targeted labor redeployment measures.&#13;
24/    Specialized counseling, requalification training, and improved job placement services have been found&#13;
to raise productivity by bringing about more efficient matching of job seekers and the skill requirements of&#13;
existing jobs (OECD Employment Outlook, 1993, page ix).&#13;
&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Proiect Objectives and Components&#13;
3.1           Project Objectives. The success of Macedonia's economic reform program will depend&#13;
upon whether the Borrower can deal effectively with the social dimensions of reform. The objective&#13;
of the proposed Social Reform and Technical Assistance Project is to support the Borrower's reform&#13;
program by:&#13;
(a)    facilitating the restructuring of socially owned enterprises through actions to reduce&#13;
the individual and community impacts of worker dislocation,&#13;
(b)    improving the delivery of social benefits and the collection of payroll contributions for&#13;
social benefits,&#13;
(c)    improving public awareness of the rationale for reform policies, and&#13;
(d)    supporting the continuing implementation of the enterprise restructuring program.&#13;
3.2           Project Components. The Project,. to be implemented over four years, comprises&#13;
four components with a total estimated cost of approximately US$ 17.1 million. The components are&#13;
structured as follows:&#13;
(a)    Labor Redeployment (US$ 10.9 million). This component will support the&#13;
redeployment of labor in communities affected by large-scale enterprise restructuring&#13;
by: (i) analyzing the labor requirements of socially-owned enterprises (SOEs) which&#13;
are undergoing restructuring or privatization, (ii) providing pre-layoff adjustment&#13;
services to workers in SOEs scheduled for downsizing or liquidation, (iii) providing&#13;
post-layoff services to the displaced workers, through a Labor Redeployment Fund, to&#13;
accelerate their return to productive employment, (iv) strengthening Employment&#13;
Bureau services for job seekers, and (v) establishing a Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU) to support overall project implementation.&#13;
(b)    Public Information Program (US$ 1.4 million). This component will support the&#13;
development of public media information programs in order to build support for the&#13;
country's economic reform program. It will do this by: (i) creating a Media&#13;
Coordinating Unit in the Privatization Agency to oversee the public information&#13;
program, (ii) conducting surveys to assess public knowledge and opinion on economic&#13;
reform issues to guide the development of an effective public information program,&#13;
and (iii) developing and carrying out a public media program to inform the public of&#13;
the rationale for specific reform measures.&#13;
25/    Detailed Project Action Matrices, including goals, objectives and activities, are contained in Section I&#13;
of the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
(c)    Social Benefit Programs (US$ 2.4 million). This component will help develop more&#13;
equitable, efficient, and financially sustainable social benefit programs by: (i)&#13;
developing objective poverty criteria as a basis for targeting social assistance, (ii)&#13;
developing actuarially-based pension planning, and (iii) improving payroll tax&#13;
collection by improving business registration procedures and strengthening audit and&#13;
enforcement controls.&#13;
(d)    Enterprise Restructurinig Technical Assistance (US$ 2.4 million). This component&#13;
would provide technical assistance to: (i) establish a Trustee Unit at the Privatization&#13;
Agency to manage enterprise restructuring, (ii) accelerate privatization of viable SOEs&#13;
and liquidation of non-viable SOEs, (iii) impose stringent financial controls on&#13;
external resources provided to enterprises from the state budget or the banking&#13;
system, and (iv) identify the post-privatization technical assistance needs of SOEs.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
Labor Redeployment (US$ 10.9 million)&#13;
3.3            The Borrower is embarking on a major restructuring and privatization program of the&#13;
largest loss-making enterprises. This component supports that program by financing short-term labor&#13;
redeployment activities linked to the privatization program. With one exception, the component's five&#13;
sub-components would be administered by the Privatization Agency to ensure direct linkage with the&#13;
privatization program. The exception is the Employment Bureau sub-component, which would be&#13;
administered by the National Employment Bureau26. The Project would provide financing for: 76&#13;
months of international technical assistance, 83 months of international training, 538 months of local&#13;
technical assistance, equipment (primarily automation equipment for the Employment Bureau sub-&#13;
component), and financial resources for the Labor Redeployment Fund (LRF) to pay for services for&#13;
displaced workers. The five subcomponents are described below:&#13;
3       2.4   Enterprise Analysis (US$ 2.0 million). The Project would provide technical&#13;
assistance27 to: (a) develop a framework at Privatization Agency to help SOEs identify labor and&#13;
social infrastructure to be divested during privatization; and (b) use the framework to undertake&#13;
analyses of Socially-Owned Enterprise (SOE) requirements and make recommendations to facilitate&#13;
the privatization program.&#13;
(a)    Specific activities required to develop a framework for SOE analysis would include:&#13;
(i) establishment of an Employment Assistance Group (EAG) of six staff to manage all&#13;
Privatization Agency labor redeployment programs; (ii) identification of existing&#13;
national labor legislation, regulations, and sectoral agreements that may affect layoffs;&#13;
(iii) design of techniques for matching existing and future SOE labor force&#13;
26/    See para. 4.8 and the Project Operational Manual for detailed descriptions of implementation&#13;
arrangements for all components.&#13;
27/    Assistance would include 22 months of international consultants, 400 months of local consultants&#13;
including six long-term consultant staff for the EAG, and 31 months of external training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
requirements, including identification of labor force characteristics and methods for&#13;
obtaining new management's labor requirements from managers and advisors, such as&#13;
international comparators; and (iv) development of techniques for acquiring and&#13;
displaying information on the social services that SOEs are making available to&#13;
employees.&#13;
(b)    Applying the above framework to each of the 20 to 30 SOEs which request assistance&#13;
would involve: (i) defining local labor regulations that may affect SOE labor divesture&#13;
decisions; (ii) analyzing existing and future labor requirements, then performing an&#13;
analysis netting out future labor requirements to define the numbers of staff to be&#13;
redeployed and/or divested; and (iii) identifying the social services made available via&#13;
the enterprise along with recommendations for divesture and an analyses of labor&#13;
displacement.&#13;
3.5            Pre-Lavoff Assistance (US$ 0.7 million). The Project would provide technical&#13;
assistance2l to support the: (a) development of labor adjustment planning techniques at the&#13;
Privatization Agency for use in affected SOEs; and (b) provision of pre-layoff services in SOEs to&#13;
make workers aware of alternatives for income support and employment, thereby increasing public&#13;
acceptance of the labor shedding program and reducing the duration of unemployment.&#13;
(a)    Labor adjustment planning activities would include development of: (i) procedures and&#13;
advance notice regulations for triggering the provision of pre-layoff labor adjustment&#13;
services to SOEs; (ii) sample agreements for delivery of services from the&#13;
Privatization Agency technical assistance contractor to SOEs; (iii) materials to&#13;
promote the labor adjustment prograrn to SOEs/communities and define the demand&#13;
for these services; and (iv) training for a cadre of at least five local technical advisors&#13;
who would to assist SOEs in implementing pre-layoff adjustment services.&#13;
(b)    Providing pre-layoff services at the 20-30 SOE sites which request assistance would&#13;
entail: (i) holding orientation sessions for SOE management and labor representatives&#13;
to publicize the nature of the labor adjustment planning process; (ii) finalizing&#13;
agreements between the Privatization Agency and the SOE for the provision of&#13;
planning services; and (iii) providing SOE-level labor adjustment planning services&#13;
such as developing a detailed inventory of displaced workers, establishing eligibility of&#13;
workers for income support, providing initial job counseling and identifying which&#13;
workers may want to participate in active labor programs.&#13;
3.6           Post-Layoff Services (US$ 6.0 million). The Project would provide technical&#13;
assistance and financial resources29 to: (a) develop a framework to enable the Privatization Agency&#13;
28/    Assistance would include seven months of international consultants, 96 months of local consultants, and&#13;
12 months of external training.&#13;
29/    Assistance would include 27 months of international consultants, 26 months of local consultants, 30&#13;
months of external training, and the US$5.0 million LRF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
to provide assistance to help SOEs in organizing labor redeployment services for displaced workers;&#13;
and (b) deliver services, through a LRF, to workers displaced from SOEs30.&#13;
(a)    Developing a framework for post-layoff assistance would include: (i) designing&#13;
procedures (following principles and criteria agreed with the Bank)3' for disbursement&#13;
of resources through the LRF, including sample contracts to be signed by the&#13;
Privatization Agency and SOEs for use of LRF funds; (ii) developing materials and&#13;
disseminating information to SOEs and local organizations regarding the availability of&#13;
LRF funds for labor services, sub-contracting procedures, and criteria to obtain and&#13;
use these funds (following criteria and procedures agreed with the Bank); and (iii)&#13;
developing a system to monitor the use of funds and evaluate the impact of local labor&#13;
adjustment services (see POM for project monitoring and outcome indicators).&#13;
(b)    Delivering post-layoff services in the 20-30 SOEs in the SRP would involve: (i)&#13;
consummating contracts between the Privatization Agency and SOEs, or local&#13;
organizations, for receipt and use of LRF funds; (ii) delivering services to displaced&#13;
workers through sub-contracts between the SOE/local organizations and local service&#13;
providers; (iii) providing limited technical assistance from the Privatization Agency&#13;
technical assistance contractor to local service providers to assist them in developing&#13;
selected services, including small business incubators, model small business assistance&#13;
centers, model public works programs, and up to ten community economic&#13;
development plans; and (iv) monitoring and evaluating the organization and&#13;
implementation of programs by SOEs and sub-contractors.&#13;
3.7           The LRF would be established as a budget line at the Privatization Agency and would&#13;
finance a range of demand-driven services, including career and employment counseling, relocation&#13;
assistance, retraining programs, transitional public works programs, small business assistance, small&#13;
business incubators, and local economic development planning. The mix of services financed would&#13;
vary according to the characteristics and preferences of the community and the displaced workers.&#13;
There would no pre-determined allocation of resources to any one service offered under the LRF.&#13;
SOEs and/or other community groups delivering services would be reimbursed for the costs of the&#13;
services according to principles and criteria agreed with the Bank (see Annex V).&#13;
3.8           Key principles driving the use of the LRF are as follows: (a) the supply of services&#13;
would be demand-driven in response to requests from displaced workers and advisory input from the&#13;
social partners; (b) communities would be eligible for LRF support only if they contain an SOE&#13;
which is undergoing a Privatization Agency approved privatization/restructuring programn; (c)&#13;
individuals would be eligible for LRF financed services if they have been given notice of dismissal,&#13;
or have been dismissed from SOEs undergoing a Privatization Agency approved&#13;
privatizationlrestructuring program; (d) the costs of services reimbursed from the LRF to service&#13;
providers would be based on the average cost per dismissed worker times the number of workers&#13;
receiving services; (e) the impact of services for displaced workers would be evaluated on the basis&#13;
30/    SOEs would norrnally organize post-layoff services; however, in some cases (e.g., when an SOE was&#13;
liquidated) other community organizations (e.g., labor unions) could be selected to organize post-layoff services.&#13;
31/    Described in paragraphs 3.6 et seq.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
of job placement information which must be provided by the service provider; and (f) labor mobility&#13;
among displaced workers would be facilitated by allowing workers in communities qualifying for&#13;
assistance under the LRF to be eligible for services in their communities or in other communities&#13;
receiving assistance under the Fund.32&#13;
3.9           When an SOE, or other community organization, has been identified and approved by&#13;
the EAG as being eligible to receive LRF funds, the SOE and Privatization Agency EAG would sign&#13;
a contract which controls the use funds. The SOE would subsequently be responsible for organizing&#13;
the services through sub-contracts with local service providers. The Privatization Agency/SOE&#13;
contract would specify the: (a) types of sub-projects and services for which funds could be used; (b)&#13;
local private and public agencies which would be eligible to sub-contract to deliver these services; (c)&#13;
costs which would be reimbursed for services delivered; (d) minimum requirements for fiscal and&#13;
program reporting; and (e) sub-contracting procedures. The SOE would be responsible for organizing&#13;
services based on labor market demand and needs identified by workers during the pre-layoff&#13;
analysis. 33&#13;
3.10          Emplonnent Bureau (US$1.7 million). The Project would provide technical&#13;
assistance and equipment34 to strengthen the ability of the Employment Bureau to provide cost&#13;
effective services to job seekers35 by: (a) developing model local employment bureau services; and&#13;
(b) completing automation of local employment bureaus in order to improve service delivery and&#13;
cost-effectiveness.&#13;
(a)    Developing services to be delivered by the local employment bureau would include:&#13;
(i) reviewing procedures for operation of local offices, including client registration,&#13;
cash benefit payments, organization and delivery of active labor services;&#13;
(ii) expanding employer services and refining vacancy identification procedures; (iii)&#13;
developing job search, job club, and simple client administered aptitude and interest&#13;
assessment instruments for use with employment bureau clients; and (iv) developing&#13;
systematic techniques (i.e., semi-annual qualitative and quantitative surveys of local&#13;
enterprises) to supplement job vacancy information (see activity (ii) above) and&#13;
improve medium term labor market information. All activities would include staff&#13;
training. The National Employment Bureau could obtain additional financing to&#13;
support development and staffing of additional local employment bureau offices,&#13;
32/    The Enterprise Assistance Group at the Privatization Agency would be responsible, with the assistance&#13;
of consultants, for developing detailed procedures, within the framework agreed with the Bank, for marketing&#13;
the availability of LRF funds to SOEs, operating LRF, and monitoring the use of funds disbursed from the&#13;
Privatization Agency to SOEs.&#13;
33/    See para 4.10 for a more detailed discussion of LRF implementation procedures, including the flow of&#13;
funds from IDA through the LRF.&#13;
34/    Assistance would include 15 months of international consultants, 16 months of local consultants, 30&#13;
months of external training plus approximately US$0.5 million for automation equipment.&#13;
35/    See Annex III for a summary of the location, staffing, and automation of services at local employment&#13;
offices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
through the LRF, if these offices were successful in winning local sub-contracts from&#13;
SOEs to deliver in-depth employment and counseling services to displaced workers.&#13;
(b)    Automating the local employment bureaus would require: (i) organizing and staffing&#13;
an automation department at the National Employment Bureau and reviewing and&#13;
updating the existing automation plan to ensure that it will support delivery of current&#13;
and future local employment bureau services; (ii) developing a simplified automation&#13;
timetable, procedures, and policy manuals for central operation (including plans for&#13;
interchange of data with social assistance offices); (iii) preparing the specifications and&#13;
procuring goods and services for computer hardware, software upgrades as needed,&#13;
site preparation, installation, technical assistance, and maintenance for local&#13;
employment bureaus and the national office; (iv) overseeing the functional&#13;
requirements, design parameters, implementation timetable, and installation of&#13;
hardware and training of local staff by the selected contractor; and (v) evaluating&#13;
implementation of automation program modules and equipment once installation in all&#13;
local offices is complete.&#13;
3.11          Project Coordination Unit (US$ 0.4 million). The project would provide technical&#13;
assistance36 to help the Privatization Agency coordinate Project execution from a global perspective to&#13;
facilitate the procurement-related work of the technical ministries, and to act as a liaison between the&#13;
technical ministries and World Bank. Specific activities would include: (a) coordinating Project&#13;
implementation, (b) managing all procurement under the project in cooperation with the technical&#13;
ministries, and (c) managing the disbursement of all World Bank loan funds, including monitoring the&#13;
implementation progress of specific project components and preparing progress reports. To help&#13;
ensure that project objectives, performance targets and schedules are met successfully, a PCU has&#13;
been established in the Privatization Agency under the Director of the Transformation and&#13;
Restructuring Department. The PCU will be responsible for coordinating all project-related tasks.&#13;
During Negotiations, the Borrower would provide assurances that the PCU would be provided with&#13;
adequate staffing resources to ensure timely execution of its tasks under the project.&#13;
3.12          During Negotiations, the Borrower provided assurances that: (a) the Labor&#13;
Redeployment Fund would only be used to finance post-layoff labor redeployment services which&#13;
meet principles, criteria and procedures agreed with the Bank.37; (b) prior to selecting the labor&#13;
redeployment technical assistance contractor, the Privatization Agency would select six&#13;
individuals to work in the Enterprise Assistance Group as long-term, full-time consultants under&#13;
the technical assistance contract; and (c) by the time the Employment Bureau technical&#13;
assistance is contracted the National Employment Bureau shall establish and maintain an&#13;
Automation Department at the EB and staff it with four full-time professionals, and provide&#13;
36/    Assistance would include five months of international consultants and two months of external training.&#13;
This sub-component is presented as part of the labor redeployment component because the PCU and labor&#13;
redeployment activities are centered in the Privatization Agency, and the majority of PCU activities will support&#13;
the labor redeployment program which is the largest part of the Project.&#13;
37/    See Annex V for criteria for Labor Redeployment Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
three additional full-time professional staff to support development of model job vacancy listing,&#13;
job search, and labor market information programs.&#13;
Public Information Campaign (US$ 1.4 million)&#13;
3.13         The Project would finance technical assistance services38 to: establish a Media&#13;
Coordination Unit (MCU) at the Privatization Agency, conduct surveys to obtain information on&#13;
public opinion to serve as a basis for formulating a Public Information Campaign (PIC), and create&#13;
and execute a media campaign aimed at bolstering public support and involvement in support of the&#13;
Economic and Social Reforms Program.&#13;
(a)    The Media Coordination Unit (MCU) would focus on coordinating and facilitating&#13;
execution of the Public Information Program. Establishing the MCU would include:&#13;
(i) developing and implementing MCU operating procedures; (ii) developing MCU&#13;
infrastructure including locating and equipping office space, and hiring and training&#13;
approximately five personnel; (iii) assisting with implementation of a public opinion&#13;
survey, and assisting advertising agency consultants to organize and execute PR&#13;
campaign; (iv) establishing a Public Information Campaign Advisory Committee to&#13;
receive, share and comment on information regarding the Public Information&#13;
Campaign; and (v) monitoring and reporting to the PCU and Public Information&#13;
Campaign Advisory Committee (every six months) on progress towards achievement&#13;
of the objectives , and expenditures, of the Public Information Campaign.&#13;
(b)    Conducting public opinion surveys would entail: (i) developing a representative&#13;
sample and creating a survey instrument to identify awareness, attitudes and&#13;
preferences of different segments of the public towards the Economic and Social&#13;
Reform Program, including, but not limited to four fields: the market economy, the&#13;
labor market, fiscal policy, and social programs; and (ii) creating and executing a&#13;
post-carnpaign survey to measure progress of the canpaign, using instruments and&#13;
methodology consistent with the pre-campaign survey, and executing the post-&#13;
campaign survey every six months.&#13;
(c)    Developing and executing a media campaign would include: (i) creating an umbrella&#13;
concept, based on survey results, to define the goal of the advertising campaign,&#13;
target audiences and select messages, for each field; (ii) producing all materials, as&#13;
proposed and accepted by the MCU; (iii) defining, planning and executing all media&#13;
plans, strategy and tactics, as proposed and accepted by the MCU; and (iv) adjusting&#13;
the campaign based on the results of the post-campaign survey.&#13;
3.14         During negotiations, the Borrower provided assurances that the Privatization&#13;
Agency shall establish, by August 30, 1995, a Media Coordination Unit (MCU) staffed with five&#13;
personnel.&#13;
38/   See the POM for assumptions, based on media industry standards, for development of the Public&#13;
Information Campaign.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Social Benefit Proerams (US$ 2.4 million)&#13;
3.15           This component is aimed at making social benefit programs more equitable, efficient,&#13;
and financially sustainable.9 The Project would finance a total of 48 months of international technical&#13;
assistance, 13 months of international fellowships, and 21 months of local consultant services. The&#13;
three subcomponents are described below:&#13;
3.16          Social Assistance (US$ 1.6 million). This sub-component would provide technical&#13;
assistance' and equipment to: (a) develop objective criteria to construct a poverty line based on a&#13;
minimum consumption basket; (b) strengthen the institutional capacity of the social assistance system&#13;
to deliver benefits efficiently through more effective administration, staffing, monitoring and&#13;
enforcement, and budgeting procedures; and (c) expand automation in local social assistance offices&#13;
to improve service delivery and cost-effectiveness of services.&#13;
(a)    Developing a poverty line would include: (i) using the household budget survey data&#13;
to construct upper and lower national, regional and urban/rural poverty lines for the&#13;
economy based on a minimum consumption basket that takes into account both food&#13;
and non-food consumption; (ii) constructing three basic measures of poverty for the&#13;
economy based on the poverty line -- the head count index, the poverty gap index and&#13;
the poverty severity index -- and then using the poverty line to gauge the targeting&#13;
effectiveness of the social assistance program; and (iii) evaluating the social assistance&#13;
program to identify measures to improve efficiency and equity in the system.&#13;
(b)    Strengthening institutional capacity would entail: (i) evaluating the administration and&#13;
management of social assistance system, including links to the Employment Bureau&#13;
offices and other cash benefit programs; (ii) orienting staff to the institutional&#13;
arrangements (e.g. staffing, budgeting, information, monitoring and enforcement&#13;
procedures) of social assistance systems in three other countries; and (iii) selecting,&#13;
equipping, and developing the institutional capacity of one model social assistance&#13;
office.&#13;
(c)    Automating the social assistance offices would require: (i) organizing and staffing an&#13;
automation department at the MOLSP's Social Assistance Department and preparing&#13;
an automation plan to support delivery of social assistance services; (ii) developing a&#13;
simplified automation timetable, procedures, and policy manuals for central operation,&#13;
including plans for interchange of data between social assistance offices and&#13;
employment bureau offices; (iii) preparing the specifications and procuring goods and&#13;
services for computer hardware, software upgrades as needed, site preparation,&#13;
installation, technical assistance, and maintenance for local social assistance offices&#13;
and the national office; (iv) overseeing the functional requirements, design&#13;
parameters, implementation timetable, and installation of hardware and training of&#13;
39/    The recommendations developed under this component would be supported through related&#13;
conditionality in the FESAC and subsequent lending operations.&#13;
40/    Assistance would include 13 months of international consultants, two months of local consultants, and&#13;
nine months of external training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
local staff by the selected contractor; and (v) evaluating implementation of automation&#13;
program modules and equipment once installation in all local offices is complete.&#13;
3.17          Actuarial Analysis of Pensions (US$ 0.5 million). This sub-component would&#13;
provide technical assistance4' to assist the Borrower in assessing the financial status of the social&#13;
insurance fund over a long-term period as well as the impact of simulated policy changes. This would&#13;
involve developing an actuarial model of the pension system which incorporates economic,&#13;
demographic, and policy assumptions. Activities implemented include: (a) establishing a coordinating&#13;
committee consisting of representatives from MOLSP Pension and Disability Insurance Fund,&#13;
Privatization Agency, Ministry of Development, State Statistical Bureau, and Ministry of Finance; (b)&#13;
establishing an actuarial unit within the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund; (c) identifying policy&#13;
issues by outlining changes in pension policy that the model must accommodate, including changes in&#13;
retirement ages, benefit structure, revenue collection, indexation; and conduct policy simulations by&#13;
varying economic and demographic assumptions, as well as assumptions about the efficacy of revenue&#13;
collection; (d) collecting economic and demographic data required for the model from appropriate&#13;
agencies and reporting on data deficiencies which, if resolved, would improve modelling capabilities;&#13;
(e) developing an actuarial model based on specifications provided in the policy matrix; and (f)&#13;
training staff in actuarial design and programming.&#13;
3.18          Payroll Tax Compliance (US$ 0.3 million). This sub-component would provide&#13;
technical assistance42 to improve the collection of payroll taxes through more effective business&#13;
registration and strengthened audit and enforcement controls. Activities include: (a) establishing a&#13;
coordinating committee consisting of representatives from Ministry of Finance, Public Revenue&#13;
Office, Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, and Bureau of Payment Operations; (b) developing&#13;
statistical analysis techniques and providing estimates of payroll tax revenue losses over a five-year&#13;
period; (c) evaluating tax administration procedures and recommending improvements based on&#13;
international practice, including improvements in the administration of related taxes, such as profit&#13;
taxes, sales taxes or VAT, and personal income taxes; (d) evaluating computer processing capabilities&#13;
used in payroll tax administration, and developing a general automation plan for payroll tax&#13;
processing, and for related taxes such as profit taxes, sales taxes or VAT, and personal income taxes;&#13;
and (e) evaluating pension policy in the light of potential payroll tax shortfalls to determine the need&#13;
for changes in entitlement or benefits for particular groups of pensioners.&#13;
3.19          During negotiations the Borrower provided assurances that the MOLSP shall, by&#13;
the time the technical assistance is contracted: (a) identify and assign three staff members to&#13;
work in the Actuarial Unit, and (b) maintain an Automation Unit in the Social Assistance&#13;
Department and staff it with two full-time professionals.&#13;
41/    Assistance would include 14 months of international consultants and six months of external training.&#13;
42/    Assistance would include 13 months of international consultants and five months of external training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Enterprise Restructuring Technical Assistance (US$2.4 million)&#13;
3.20            This component would provide technical expertise,'4 supplementing ongoing bilateral&#13;
assistance, to help support implementation of the Special Restructuring Program. The component&#13;
would provide expertise to help establish a Trustee Unit, reporting to a special inter-ministerial&#13;
committee chaired by the Minister of Economy and located at the Ministry of Economy. The&#13;
Trustee Unit would represent the interests of creditors and the Borrower during the implementation of&#13;
the Special Restructuring Program and would be vested with full ownership rights over the enterprises&#13;
to be restructured. The Trustee Unit would assist SOEs to cut losses and reduce costs, accelerate&#13;
privatization, exert stringent financial control, and identify post-privatization technical assistance&#13;
requirements.&#13;
(a)    Activities designed to reduce losses and cut costs would include: (i) monitoring SOE&#13;
labor shedding in each SOE4; (ii) developing rolling quarterly cash budgets for every&#13;
major activity or product and a detailed review of each revenue and cost item in the&#13;
cash budgets; (iii) developing a timetable for the implementation of loss reduction and&#13;
cost cutting measures; (iv) monitoring implementation of measures and timetables; and&#13;
(v) replacing managers, if necessary, to improve compliance with agreed loss&#13;
reduction and cost cutting measures.&#13;
(b)    Activities designed to accelerate privatization would include: (i) evaluating&#13;
privatization options; (ii) designing a privatization strategy; (iii) developing timetables&#13;
for the implementation of a chosen privatization strategy; (iv) initiating corporate&#13;
reorganizations; and (v) monitoring implementation of privatization.&#13;
(c)    Implementing strict financial controls would entail: (i) helping the TU control cash&#13;
disbursements; (ii) approving any applications for bank credit or support payments&#13;
from the fiscal budget; (iii) reviewing the use of funds from any asset sales in order to&#13;
protect creditors and ensure funds would not be used to cover recurrent losses; and&#13;
(iv) initiating liquidation procedures in the cases of enterprises with no prospects for&#13;
generating positive operating cash flows.&#13;
(d)    Identifying post-privatization technical assistance activities would require: (i) designing&#13;
appropriate packages for the delivery of such assistance to each SOE; and (ii)&#13;
reporting to the Privatization Agency and to the Inter-ministerial Committee on overall&#13;
SRP status.&#13;
3.21          During negotiations the Borrower provided assurances that the Ministry of&#13;
Economy would, by the time the technical assistance contract supporting the restructuring&#13;
program is negotiated, identify and hire a manager and two support staff for the Trustee Unit to&#13;
be located in the Ministry of Economy.&#13;
43/    Consisting of approximately 76 months of international technical assistance, 96 months of local&#13;
consultants, and travel and per diem support for 128 months of international volunteers.&#13;
44/    Enterprise labor analysis, pre and post-layoff assistance to displaced workers is being financed under&#13;
the Labor Redeployment Component of the Project (para. 3.3).&#13;

IV. PROJECT COSTS. FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Proiect Costs&#13;
4.1                  Summary  of Project Costs.  Total estimated  Project cost is US$  171 million&#13;
equivalent, including contingencies, local taxes and duties. Total contingencies (physical and price)&#13;
amount to US$ 0.5 million which represents about 3 percent of total base cost (US$ 16.6 million).&#13;
The Project cost includes consulting services, fellowships and training, furniture, equipment and&#13;
materials, vehicles, the Labor Redeployment Fund, and incremental operating costs generated by the&#13;
investments during the implementation period. Base cost estimates were calculated in US dollar&#13;
equivalent and reflect costs at the time of pre-appraisal in September 1994. The estimated Project&#13;
costs are summnarized in Tables 1 and 2 below, and are shown in detail in the Project Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
4.2           Basis of Cost Estimates. Project costs were estimated on the following basis:&#13;
(a)    Base Costs. All project costs were estimated in US Dollars given that inflation of the&#13;
Denar is difficult to predict. Costs shown in Denar are the result of converting dollar&#13;
estimates at the rate of 40 Denar/US$ 1.00 (December 1994). The average cost of&#13;
foreign specialist consulting services (US$ 18,000 per month) is based on recent&#13;
contracts for comparable services in other Bank-financed projects in the central and&#13;
eastern European region. This unit cost includes fees, relocation/recruitment costs,&#13;
housing and subsistence, and overheads. The average cost of local consultants has&#13;
been estimated at US$ 3,000 per month. Overseas fellowships and study visits are&#13;
estimated to cost US$ 8,000 per staff month on the average. Price estimates for&#13;
office equipment, including computers, and furniture are based on current market&#13;
prices in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.&#13;
(b)    Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a five percent contingency allowance&#13;
for unforeseen physical variations on all equipment and furniture. The total physical&#13;
contingency of US$ 0.1 million is equal to less than one percent of the estimated base&#13;
cost. The low physical contingencies reflect the absence of civil works in the project&#13;
and the limited funds allocated to goods and equipment procurement. In the absence&#13;
of forecasts for annual local price escalation and exchange rates, price increases have&#13;
been applied to both local and foreign costs in US dollar terms at the rate of 2 percent&#13;
per annum. Estimated price contingencies total US$ 0.4 million.&#13;
(c)    Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component was estimated as&#13;
follows: (i) Labor Redeployment Fund (0 percent), (ii) office furniture and equipment,&#13;
materials and software (95 percent), (iii) expatriate consulting services, fellowships&#13;
and studies (100 percent), (iv) local consultants, local training, local staff salaries (0&#13;
percent), and (v) maintenance (0 percent). The resulting foreign exchange&#13;
component, including contingencies, is estimated at US$ 7.6 million, or about 45&#13;
percent of total project cost.&#13;
(d)    Taxes. The Project has been costed net of import taxes and duties, contingent upon&#13;
the Borrower issuing an exemption on the payment of duties and taxes on goods&#13;
(equipment and materials) and services imported directly in connection with foreign-&#13;
financed projects. If this exemption is not forthcoming, funds would have to be added&#13;
to the Borrower's counterpart contribution to cover the costs of these expenses.&#13;
Project costs include less than US$ 0.1 million equivalent in taxes on locally procured&#13;
works, goods and services.&#13;
4.3           Recurrent Costs. Recurrent costs, estimated at US$ 1.7 million and included the total&#13;
project cost estimates, are the incremental operating costs generated by project investments. These&#13;
recurrent costs arise from: (i) salaries for PCU and the coordinating committees for the labor fund,&#13;
the media campaign and pension reform, (ii) maintenance of new equipment and vehicles, and&#13;
(iii) office materials and supplies for the PCU and the committees. These costs are included in total&#13;
project costs only to ensure that these amounts are budgeted as Borrower counterpart funds on an&#13;
annual basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
B. Project Financing&#13;
4.4                  The proposed IDA Credit of US$ 14.0 million equivalent would finance 82 percent of&#13;
the total project cost, or 100 percent of the foreign exchange component, and 67 percent of local costs&#13;
net of taxes. The Borrower would finance the remaining 33 percent of local costs and all taxes and&#13;
duties, for a total of US$ 3.1 million equivalent. Retroactive financing of ten percent (10%) of the&#13;
credit, amounting to one million four hundred thousand US dollars equivalent (US$1,400,000), would&#13;
be made available effective January 1, 1995. Retroactive financing would be used exclusively to&#13;
support provision of post-layoff services to displaced workers through the Labor Redeployment Fund&#13;
(LRF). (see Table 4 1. A) The project financing plan is shown in Tables 3 and 4 below.&#13;

4.6          Labor Redeployment. The Privatization Agency, under the general guidance of the&#13;
Managing Board of the Privatization Agency, will be responsible for implementation of the first three&#13;
labor redeployment sub-components: enterprise analysis, pre-layoff services, and post-layoff services.&#13;
An Enterprise Assistance Group (EAG), consisting of six long-term consultant staff financed by the&#13;
Credit, will be established to administer these sub-components.&#13;
4.7          There would be one umbrella technical assistance contract which would provide&#13;
services to the Privatization Agency and SOEs involved in the three major components of the labor&#13;
redeployment program (bids have been requested for this assistance and work will be initiated under&#13;
45/    More detailed information is found in Section I of the Project Operational Manual - POM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
the PPF). This contractor would provide six long-term local consultants to staff the EAG, several&#13;
long-term international consultants to develop procedures and materials for operating the labor&#13;
redeployment program, and additional short-term consultants, on demand, depending on individual&#13;
SOE requirements.&#13;
4.8           LRF would be established as a budget line item at the Privatization Agency. Funds&#13;
would be disbursed to qualifying SOEs which would organize delivery of post-layoff labor&#13;
redeployment services for displaced workers through sub-contracts with local service providers, in&#13;
keeping with the principles and criteria agreed with IDA (see para. 3.6). The flow and control of&#13;
funds would be as follows, and similar to that used in other projects (e.g., Turkey):&#13;
(a)    Privatization Agency would establish the LRF with State budget funds (approximately&#13;
US$ 300,000 or 25 percent of expenditures for one year);&#13;
(b)    Eligible SOEs would sign agreements with the Privatization Agency regarding use of&#13;
LRF funds in keeping with criteria agreed with IDA;&#13;
(c)    SOEs would open local commercial bank accounts to receive LRF funds, as specified&#13;
in the Privatization Agency/SOE agreement;&#13;
(d)    SOEs would establish sub-contracts with local service providers for labor&#13;
redeployment services consistent with the Privatization Agency/SOE agreement;&#13;
(e)    Privatization Agency would forward an initial deposit to the SOE local commercial&#13;
account (approximately 25 percent of expenditures for one year of services for&#13;
displaced workers);&#13;
(f)    SOE sub-contractors would deliver services and invoice the SOE each month based on&#13;
the average unit costs of delivering services times the number of workers provided&#13;
with services;&#13;
(g)    SOEs would forward invoices and program reports to the Privatization Agency/EAG&#13;
on a monthly basis as agreed;&#13;
(h)    Privatization Agency would review invoices and reimburse the SOE commercial bank&#13;
account for services provided as noted in (i) following;&#13;
(i)    Privatization Agency would obtain reimbursement for 75 percent of the costs of local&#13;
expenditures for labor redeployment services through the Special Account established&#13;
under the Credit and 25 percent from local funds; and&#13;
(j)    Each year the Privatization Agency would replenish the LRF with approximately US$&#13;
300,000 in local funds in recognition of the fact that the IDA credit would only&#13;
reimburse 75 percent of costs after services are provided at the local level to displaced&#13;
workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
4.9          Employment Bureau. The Employment Bureau (EB) will be the implementation&#13;
agency for development of this sub-component of the labor redeployment program which includes&#13;
development of the model local employment bureau and the automation of all local bureaus.&#13;
4.10         Public Information Campaign (PIC). The Privatization Agency will be responsible&#13;
for organization, execution and implementation of the PIC. The first step in implementation of this&#13;
component will be the establishment of the Media Coordination Unit (MCU) at the Privatization&#13;
Agency.&#13;
4.11         Social Assistance. This sub-component of the social benefit component would be&#13;
implemented by the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy in cooperation with the Statistical Agency.&#13;
4.12         Actuarial Analysis. This sub-component of the social benefit component would be&#13;
implemented by the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy. A coordinating committee will be&#13;
established consisting of representatives from concerned agencies.&#13;
4.13         Payroll Tax Compliance. This sub-component of the social benefit component would&#13;
be implemented by the Ministry of Finance. A coordinating committee will be established consisting&#13;
of representatives from concerned agencies.&#13;
4.14         Restructuring Program Technical Assistance. The Special Restructuring Program&#13;
will be directed by a special inter-ministerial committee chaired by the Minister of Economy, and&#13;
administered by a Trustee Unit which would be vested with ownership rights over the SOEs. The&#13;
Trustee Unit would be located at the Privatization Agency.&#13;
Project Management Arrangements&#13;
4.15         Proiect Coordination Unit (PCU). To help ensure that Project objectives,&#13;
performance targets and schedules are met successfully, a Project Coordination Unit has been&#13;
established in the Privatization Agency under the direction of the Director of the Transformation and&#13;
Restructuring Department. The PCU would be responsible for coordinating all Project-related tasks.&#13;
The PCU is located in the Privatization Agency because the major focus of the Credit is on&#13;
supporting SOE restructuring. During negotiations the borrower provided assurances that the&#13;
Privatization Agency shall ensure that a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) is maintained&#13;
comprising a Coordinator, Procurement Assistant, and a Secretary. The day-to-day&#13;
implementation of individual project components would be the responsibility of the technical&#13;
ministries. The PCU's role would be one of support and facilitation. A Technical Coordination&#13;
Committee, consisting of the technical directors or their representatives and the Project Coordinator,&#13;
will be formed. It would meet on a regular basis to discuss and resolve issues which effect project&#13;
execution.&#13;
4.16         Proiect Commitment and Sustainability. The project was prepared largely by&#13;
Government Agencies -- the Privatization Agency, MOF, and MOLSP. During preparation, these&#13;
agencies developed individual components through dialogue with project beneficiaries and&#13;
stakeholders, including representatives from labor and employers. The Special Restructuring Program&#13;
will be implemented under the general guidance of a special inter-ministerial committee chaired by the&#13;
Ministry of Economy and will be administered by a Trustee Unit for restructuring enterprises located&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
at the Ministry of Economy. Working groups are being established to provide guidance for&#13;
implementation of each component of the project, including an enterprise assistance group for the&#13;
labor redeployment component, a public information program advisory committee, multi-agency&#13;
coordinating committees for the social benefit component, and a project technical coordination&#13;
committee. Borrower budget commitments of 25 percent are to be made to the LRF, which will&#13;
demonstrate Borrower commitment to this key activity. Finally, the Borrower will commit itself to the&#13;
creation and staffing of small but critical units to support the employment bureau, media development,&#13;
and social benefit components.&#13;
4.17          The principal objective of the project is sustainability of the Borrower's economic&#13;
reform program -- in particular, the restructuring of large, loss-making enterprises. The project-&#13;
supported instruments for achieving that objective are, by nature, temporary activities, and will be&#13;
phased out when the restructuring of the largest SOEs is substantially completed. The project actions&#13;
to improve the design of social benefit programs will end when those developmental actions are&#13;
completed; they will then be succeeded by implementation of the improved social benefit programs,&#13;
which may require additional investments.&#13;
4.18          Monitorin2 and Reporting. The PCU would be responsible for project monitoring.&#13;
The Project Operational Manual includes a framework for systematic monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
progress in Project implementation. It identifies a set of performance indicators to be used in Project&#13;
supervision. On a semi-annual basis, the PCU would submit to IDA a consolidated report on the&#13;
Project on the status of Project implementation, covering each component, its objectives and&#13;
activities, and including: (i) current status and issues; (ii) deviations, if any, from the implementation&#13;
plan and Project targets; (iii) recommendations for actions and forward planning; and (iv) actual and&#13;
planned expenditures. During Negotiations it was agreed that the Borrower will carry out, with IDA,&#13;
a mid-term review of the project implementation in the second half of 1996. It was further agreed&#13;
that this review would include an analysis of overall project expenditures with a view toward&#13;
reallocation between categories if mutually agreed between the Borrower and the IDA.&#13;
4.19          Proiect Completion and Evaluation. Project completion is expected by&#13;
March 31, 1999. The closing date will be September 30, 1999, or such later date as IDA shall&#13;
establish. The PCU would be responsible for preparing the Borrower's contribution to the Project&#13;
Implementation Completion Report.&#13;
4.20          IDA Supervision. Because this is the first project in the social sectors in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, it is expected that the project would require intensive supervision&#13;
estimated at a average of 16-20 staff weeks per year, and possibly more in the first year of&#13;
implementation. Project monitoring reports and indicators, the POM, and a careful review of project&#13;
expenditures and availability of project resources would forn the basis for the supervision missions&#13;
which would visit the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at least twice a year. Staffing for&#13;
supervision missions would need to include, in addition to the task manager and project&#13;
implementation specialist, periodic visits by specialists in media, pensions and social benefit&#13;
programs, and enterprise restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
D. Proiect Procurement Arraneements&#13;
4.21         Project procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 6. Sample bidding&#13;
documents are included in the POM and would be utilized for the procurement of IDA-financed&#13;
works, goods, and related services. Expenditures financed entirely with Borrower funds are shown&#13;
under the N.B.F. (Non-Bank Financed) column. A Procurement Plan (bid packaging, estimated&#13;
costs, timing) is provided in Annex VI.&#13;
4.22          The PCU would have overall responsibility for procurement activities under the&#13;
Project. Specific procurement responsibilities are listed in the POM.&#13;
4.23          Procurement procedures under the Project would be as follows:&#13;
(a)    Procurement of Goods. Goods procured under the Project would consist of office&#13;
equipment and supplies (including computers and related equipment, software,&#13;
photocopy machines, facsimile machines), vehicles, training materials and furniture.&#13;
To the extent feasible, invitations for bids on equipment would be grouped into sizable&#13;
bid packages in order to promote competition and benefit from economies of scale in&#13;
bid prices. Contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$ 50,000 (up to&#13;
an aggregate of US$ 1.4 million) or more would be subject to prior review and would&#13;
be procured following liniited international bidding (LIB) procedures in accordance&#13;
with Guidelines - Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995).&#13;
Only three contracts are expected to fall into this category: two for computer&#13;
equipment for the Employment Bureaus and the Social Benefit Offices (about US$&#13;
600,000 each), and one for vehicles procurement for various implementing agencies&#13;
(about US$ 150,000). These three contracts, procured through LIB, would constitute&#13;
about 64 percent of the total cost of IDA-financed goods (exclusive of the Labor&#13;
Redeployment Fund). The remaining 36 percent of IDA-financed goods would be&#13;
grouped into minor packages as follows: (a) contracts for goods (aggregate IDA&#13;
US$ 500,000) estimated to cost US$ 50,000 equivalent or less per contract, including&#13;
off-the-shelf items such as office and training supplies, software and office equipment,&#13;
may be purchased through national shopping (NS) on the basis of a minimum of&#13;
three price quotations obtained from qualified suppliers; and (b) contracts for goods&#13;
which IDA agrees are of a proprietary nature, e.g., computer software and materials,&#13;
etc. (US$ 50,000 equivalent or less in the aggregate IDA financing), may be acquired&#13;
through direct procurement from proprietors and/or copyright holders, in accordance&#13;
with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
(b)    Procurement under the Labor Redeployment Fund. Procurement under the Labor&#13;
Redeployment Fund (aggregate US$ 3,750 million under the IDA Credit) would be&#13;
exclusively for services. Individual contracts for services such as employment&#13;
counseling, retraining and small business assistance are not estimated to exceed US$&#13;
50,000. Service contracts for small business incubators are not expected to exceed&#13;
US$ 350,000, and would be subjected to a competitive selection process.&#13;
Procurement under the Labor Redeployment Fund would be carried out by the&#13;
Privatization Agency and would generally be carried out on a sole source basis&#13;
(except for the incubators as noted above). Detailed procedures for disbursement and&#13;
control of funds are provided in paragraph 4.10 and in Section 1: 1. C. of the POM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
(c)    Procurement of Consulting Services. Consultants for specialized and professional&#13;
services financed under the Project would be selected in accordance with the&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). Specialized services include seven&#13;
consulting packages (aggregate IDA US$8.3 million - see Chart 3.1) which could be&#13;
provided by qualified consulting firms or institutions. To the extent feasible, external&#13;
fellowships and training programs (aggregate US$0.8 million IDA financing) shall be&#13;
included as part of the technical assistance packages procured from consulting firms&#13;
and training institutions. Local training would be carried out as part of the terms of&#13;
reference of the contracted specialists. The list of consulting services and training&#13;
needs supported by the Project is shown in Annex VII.&#13;
(d)    Incremental Operating Costs. Equipment maintenance services, office supplies and&#13;
materials and staff salaries would be financed entirely by the Borrower and would be&#13;
procured in accordance with current Borrower procedures.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.24          Contract Review. The procurement documentation to be submitted for prior review&#13;
by IDA includes invitations to quote, technical specifications, and draft contracts. It is estimated that&#13;
prior review would cover about 95 percent of the value of all contracts for goods and consulting&#13;
services (exclusive of the Labor Redeployment Fund). The remaining contracts would be subject to&#13;
selective post-award reviews by IDA. Prior review by IDA would be required for all LIB and DC&#13;
contracts. Prior review, and documentation required, for technical assistance contracts would be as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)    Technical Assistance: (i) contracts with consultant firms valued at US$ 50,000&#13;
equivalent or more--all procurement documentation (budgets, TORs, selection&#13;
procedures, short lists, letters of invitation, evaluation report, draft contracts); (ii)&#13;
single-source individual consultant contracts and assignments of a critical nature, as&#13;
reasonably determined by IDA-- all procurement documentation (see above); (iii)&#13;
individual consultant contracts less than US$ 50,000 equivalent--TORs; and&#13;
(d) amendments to the employment of consultants raising the contract value to US$&#13;
50,000 equivalent or above--TORs; and&#13;
(b)    Fellowships and Training: TORs for external fellowships and study visits.6&#13;
4.25          Procurement Infornation to be Provided by the Borrower. The PCU would&#13;
promptly inform IDA of contract awards and procurement issues, and would include the following&#13;
procurement information in periodic progress reports:&#13;
(a)    revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best&#13;
estimates of allowances for physical and price contingencies;&#13;
(b)    revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award&#13;
and completion time for individual contract; and&#13;
(c)    status of aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;
E. Disbursements&#13;
4.26          The project is the first IDA operation in the human resources sector in FYR&#13;
Macedonia, and therefore, the country disbursement profile is speculative. The project has been&#13;
designed to be carried out over a four-year period, and credit funds are expected to be fully&#13;
disbursed within sixteen (16) quarters after Board Approval (or by September 30, 1999).&#13;
Disbursements would be made as follows:&#13;
(a)    Goods (equipment, furniture, materials and proprietary items): 100 percent of foreign&#13;
expenditure; 100 percent of ex-factory cost of locally-manufactured items; and 85&#13;
percent of the cost of locally procured items; and&#13;
46/   In general fellowships/training and related consulting services would be integrated in one Terms of&#13;
Reference to simplify implementation, facilitate coordination, and strengthen technical assistance services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
(b)    Technical assistance, studies, fellowships, and external training: 100 percent.&#13;
(c)    Labor Redeployment Fund; costs of post-layoff services provided to displaced&#13;
workers: 75 percent.&#13;
4.27         Civil service staff salaries, operation and maintenance costs of equipment and other&#13;
non-salary operating costs would be financed by the Borrower.&#13;
4.28         All withdrawal applications will be fully documented except that contracts for goods&#13;
not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent and contracts for technical assistance, studies, fellowships and&#13;
training not exceeding US$50,000 will be supported by Statements of Expenditure (SOE) certified by&#13;
the PCU Project Coordinator. The required supporting documentation would be retained by the PCU&#13;
for at least one year after receipt by IDA of the audit report for the year in which the last&#13;
disbursement was made. This documentation would be made available for review by the auditors and&#13;
by visiting IDA staff upon request. The processing, disbursement and monitoring of the allocations&#13;
of the proceeds of the IDA Credit and Borrower counterpart financing would be managed by the PCU&#13;
in coordination and consultation with the MOF.&#13;
4.29         Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower would&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, a Special Account for&#13;
the PCU, denominated in US Dollars, in a bank acceptable to IDA. Payments of eligible expenditure&#13;
(goods, furniture, specialist services, training) may be made by the PCU out of the Special Account.&#13;
The Special Account may be established with a total authorized allocation of US$ 1,000,000. The&#13;
initial deposit into the Special Account will be US$ 500,000 until the aggregate amount of&#13;
withdrawals from the Credit account shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of US$ 1.0 million.&#13;
The Special Account would be replenished at least on a quarterly basis or when the undisbursed&#13;
balance falls below an amount equal to 50 percent or less of the initial deposit whichever occurs first.&#13;
In addition, monthly bank statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the&#13;
Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests. All other applications for direct payments or&#13;
issuance of Special Commitments must be for an amount not less than 20 percent of the Special&#13;
Account allocation.&#13;
4.30         Proiect Account and Audits. Separate project accounts would be maintained by the&#13;
PCU. The Project accounts, including the PCU accounts and the Special Account, would be audited&#13;
in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the&#13;
World Bank (March 1982). Within six months of the end of Borrower's fiscal year, IDA would be&#13;
provided with an audit report of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request, including a&#13;
separate opinion by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA, on disbursements against certified&#13;
SOEs. The separate opinion should mention whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year,&#13;
together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to&#13;
support the related withdrawal applications.&#13;
F. Status of Preparation&#13;
4.31         The Project was appraised in December 1994 on the basis of a detailed Project&#13;
Operational Manual (POM) which includes implementation schedules, sample bidding documents and&#13;
all Terms of Reference for technical assistance. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF 896) in the&#13;
amount of $ 1.0 million was approved by the RVP in December and has been signed by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
Borrower. Procurement is currently underway for four of the seven technical assistance packages&#13;
under the project, representing nearly US$ 7.0 million in financing. The initial payments for these&#13;
technical assistance contracts will be made under the PPF in March/April, 1995. Bidding should&#13;
begin shortly for the remaining three Technical Assistance contracts, which should be ready to be&#13;
signed shortly after credit effectiveness scheduled for June/July, 1995.&#13;
l&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1           The major benefit expected from the proposed project would be to maintain public&#13;
acceptance of the country's economic reform program, thus helping ensure the sustainability of the&#13;
reform program. In addition, labor redeployment activities supported by the project would help&#13;
reduce public budgetary outlays and increase national output by moving workers from jobs where&#13;
they are not productive, and receive public subsidies, to jobs where they are more productive. The&#13;
employment effect of some labor redeployment programs (i.e. training) may be reduced to some&#13;
extent if workers who benefit from the programs displace other workers. However, even in these&#13;
cases, the programs should contribute to increased productivity. The project would also help restore&#13;
long-run fiscal balance by improving tax collections and by establishing a more equitable, efficient,&#13;
and affordable basis for pensions and social assistance.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.2           The principal risk associated with the proposed project is that a failure to impose a&#13;
hard budget constraint could permit further delays in real restructuring of the largest loss-making&#13;
enterprises, including needed labor shedding, thereby undermining the basis for the project. The&#13;
proposed FESAC and follow-up policy oversight expected under subsequent operations would reduce&#13;
this risk to an acceptable level. Moreover, because the project is viewed by Government authorities as&#13;
a pre-requisite to effective enterprise reform, the project itself would help to mitigate this risk.&#13;
However, in the event that there are substantial delays or changes in the FESAC that affect the special&#13;
restructuring program, the configuration of the project may need to be reconsidered. Finally, the&#13;
implementation capacity of some of the agencies involved is weak. The project addresses this issue by&#13;
providing technical assistance and requiring the agencies to add small numbers of staff to support&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
Agreements Reached at Negotiations:&#13;
6.1          During Negotiations, the Borrower provided assurances that:&#13;
(a)    The Labor Redeployment Fund would only be used to finance post-layoff labor redeployment&#13;
services which meet principles and criteria agreed with the IDA (para. 3.12);&#13;
(b)    Agencies involved in Project implementation would take the following actions to increase&#13;
staffing to ensure timely execution of Project activities:&#13;
(i)    Prior to selection of the labor redeployment technical assistance contractor, the&#13;
Privatization Agency would select six individuals to work in the EAG as long-term,&#13;
full-time, consultant staff under the technical assistance contract (para. 3.12);&#13;
(ii)   By the time the Employment Bureau technical assistance is contracted the National&#13;
Employment Bureau would establish and maintain an Automation Department at the&#13;
Employment Bureau and staff it with four full time professionals and provide three&#13;
additional full-time professional staff to support development of model job vacancy&#13;
listing, job search, and labor market information programs (para. 3.12);&#13;
(iii)   The Privatization Agency shall establish, by August 30, 1995, a Media Coordination&#13;
Unit (MCU) staffed with five personnel (para. 3.14);&#13;
(iv)   The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection shall, by the time the technical&#13;
assistance is contracted: (i) identify and assign three staff members to work in the&#13;
Actuarial Unit, and (ii) maintain an Automation Unit in the Social Assistance&#13;
Department and staff it with two full-time professionals (para. 3.19);&#13;
(v)    The Ministry of Economy would, by the time the technical assistance contract&#13;
supporting the restructuring program is negotiated, identify and hire a manager and&#13;
two support staff for the Trustee Unit to be located in the Ministry of Economy&#13;
(para. 3.21); and&#13;
(vi)   The Privatization Agency shall ensure that a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) is&#13;
maintained comprising a Coordinator, Procurement Assistant, and Secretary (para.&#13;
4.15).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
6.2          Subject to the above, the proposed operation would provide a suitable basis for an&#13;
IDA credit of SDR 9.0 million (US$ 14.0 million equivalent) to the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia on standard IDA terms, with 35 years' maturity.&#13;

The Social Assistance System&#13;
1. Eligibility and Benefits&#13;
The social assistance program delivers benefits to individuals falling below established social&#13;
minima. The programs covers the employed, the unemployed and pensioners. Individuals must register&#13;
with the unemployment offices to be eligible for benefits. The social minima are established separately&#13;
by employment category and are based on an 'average consumption' basket. The amount of benefits&#13;
received by a household are equal to the difference between the individual's income and the social minima&#13;
established for the employment status of the individual. So for example, the per capita social minimum&#13;
is set at 25% average wage for the employed, 20% of average wage for pensioners and 15% of average&#13;
wage for the unemployed.'&#13;
2. Equity and Efficiency&#13;
In principle, in order to maintain work incentives, minimum wages should exceed minimum&#13;
unemployment benefits and these in turn should be greater than the 'poverty line'. In Macedonia minimum&#13;
wages (44% of average wage) are greater than unemployment benefits (36% of average wage). But the&#13;
social assistance minimum varies by household size and employment category. For a four member&#13;
household headed by an employed individual the social assistance minimum is 100% of average wage.&#13;
The higher social assistance minimum for the employed was actually instituted to maintain work&#13;
incentives in the sytem. Indeed, transfers to the employed exceed transfers to any other household&#13;
category, giving individuals an incentive to work. But there are two critical problems with the current&#13;
incentive system. Once employed individuals receive social assistance they have no incentive to leave the&#13;
system. There is a 1 unit tax on benefits per unit increase in the wage or other income components.2&#13;
Second, the current work incentives create inequities within the existing system. It is not at all clear that&#13;
pensioners have a higher subsistence requirement than the unemployed; nor is it obvious that the&#13;
unemployed have a lower consumption requirement than employed workers. The exclusion of the self&#13;
employed from the program altogether also raises grave concerns; particularly as this segment of the&#13;
population is increasing rapidly in the economy.&#13;
1/ More formally, the system can be summarized as:&#13;
Ts=   . 15wn-Y     0 &lt;Yc.15wn&#13;
Tu=   .15wn-Y   .36w&lt;Y&lt; .l5wn&#13;
Tp'=  .20wn-Y   .44w&lt;Y&lt;.20wn&#13;
Te=  .25wn-Y   .44w&lt;Y&lt;.25wn&#13;
for l&lt;n&lt;5, where Ts=Transfers to the Social Assistance recipients, Tu=Transfers to the Unemployed,&#13;
Tp=Transfers to Pensioners and Te=Transfers t o the employed, w=average wage, n=number of family members,&#13;
and Y=household income. The lower bound on the transfers to unemployed, pensioners and employed are the&#13;
minimum unemployment benefits, minimum pensions and minimum wages respectively.&#13;
2/ That is, from above equations, dT/dY=-l for all employment categories. (Assuming Y= w + rA, where&#13;
w=wages and r=rate of interest and A=value of the stock of assets).&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
Principles and Criteria for Use of The Labor Redeplovment Fund (LRF)&#13;
General Principles:&#13;
(a)    Demand: services provided by the LRF would be demand driven and based on requests from&#13;
displaced workers and advisory input from the social partners at the level of the affected&#13;
community/enterprise.&#13;
(b)    Eligible communities: LRF resources would only be available to those communities where an&#13;
SOE is undergoing a Privatization Agency approved privatization/restructuring program, and where&#13;
the number of workers displaced at the SOE(s) is projected to encompass at least 4 percent of the&#13;
workforce in the community and a minimum of 150 workers.&#13;
(c)    Eli2ible individuals: LRF financed services would only be available to workers who have&#13;
been given notice of dismissal or have been dismissed from SOEs, including workers who are&#13;
receiving unemployment benefits as well as those who may have exhausted their benefits. Workers&#13;
who are receiving benefits would receive the services described in addition to their unemployment&#13;
benefits (with the exception of those receiving stipends under public works programs, because this&#13;
would constitute a double income support payment).&#13;
(d)    Costs of services: LRF reimbursement to local agencies providing services to workers would&#13;
be based on the average unit cost of providing services to a worker times the number of workers&#13;
actually participating in the programs. Exceptions would be made in the case of incubator&#13;
development where a SOE could be reimbursed for mobilization costs as agreed between the SOE and&#13;
Privatization Agency, and reimbursement for community development plans which would be on a&#13;
lump sum basis. There is a cap of 25 percent of LRF expenditures on small business assistance and&#13;
incubator services, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank.&#13;
(e)    Evaluation of services: Service providers would be required to provide job placement&#13;
information for all participants who receive services (see special note on follow-up requirements on&#13;
retraining services on the following page).&#13;
(f)    Mobility: Labor mobility among displaced workers would be encouraged under the project.&#13;
Workers in communities qualifying for assistance under the Fund would be eligible for services in&#13;
their communities or in other communities receiving assistance under the Fund. To support this&#13;
initiative, the EAG would collect and disseminate information on services available through the Fund&#13;
throughout the country. Employment and counseling services would include information on national&#13;
job vacancies and associated training opportunities. The Fund could support relocation costs for&#13;
displaced workers to move to localities where suitable jobs are available. It could also support&#13;
transportation for participants in training programs and public works programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

profit agencies (NGOs), private firms, and other labor organizations that demonstrate&#13;
minimum capabilities to provide services (e.g. trained staff, facilities, financial viability,&#13;
placement capability).&#13;
3.     Eligible Costs: staff and administrative personnel costs, rent and utilities, non-durable&#13;
equipment and materials, client transportation for job interviews, depreciation of capital&#13;
equipment limited to 20% per year, and relocation expenses including travel of family and&#13;
transport of personal belongings to a maximum of US$ 500 per family unless otherwise&#13;
agreed with the Bank.&#13;
Criteria for Retraining Services:&#13;

of the total unit costs; or (ii) instructor costs, participant transportation, and non-durable&#13;
costs not to exceed 20 percent of staff costs, whichever is less.&#13;
Note: In order to facilitate labor mobility, SOEs would have the option of developing&#13;
training contracts with public or private training institutions and/or enterprises in their&#13;
community or any other communities. These contracts could be for individual and/or groups&#13;
of displaced workers, and these workers could participate in training in their community or&#13;
other communities. All training contracts are to include a pre-negotiated rate of job placement&#13;
in the range of 60-90 percent and would include incentives for exceeding agreed placement&#13;
rates (e.g. 10 percent bonus payments) and disincentives for not achieving agreed placement&#13;
rates (e.g. the withholding of 10 percent of final payment for training services and loss of&#13;
eligibility for further contracts). Information confirming labor market demand (e.g. review&#13;
and advisory comment by employer, union, and government representatives, evidence of&#13;
trainee demand) are required before training contracts are finalized between private/public&#13;
training agencies and SOEs or local organizations. Training service providers would be&#13;
required to provide follow-up job placement information to the Privatization Agency both&#13;
when participants exit training and on a samnple of at least 25 percent of trainees three months&#13;
after program exit.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The success of Macedonia's economic
            reform program will depend upon whether the Borrower can
            deal effectively with the social dimensions of reform. The
            Social Reform and Technical Assistance Project will support
            the Borrower's reform program by: (a) facilitating the
            restructuring of socially owned enterprises through actions
            to reduce the individual and community impacts of worker
            dislocation, (b) improving the delivery of social benefits
            and the collection of payroll contributions for social
            benefits, (c) improving public awareness of the rationale
            for reform policies, and (d) supporting the continuing
            implementation of the enterprise restructuring program.
