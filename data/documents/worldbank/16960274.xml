                         1        In India interest in bagasse cogeneration began in the 1980s, when the supply of electricity started falling short of demand. A&#13;
                                  national program to promote biomass power and bagasse cogeneration was launched in 1992. With policy support and assistance&#13;
                                  from the Indian government and the U.S. Agency for International Development, state electricity boards began offering sugar mills&#13;
                                  long-term power purchase contracts at competitive prices and with a large reduction in interconnection fees. By 2009 sugar mills&#13;
                                  in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh were contributing 2,000 megawatts to the national&#13;
                                  electricity grid. Today, of the roughly 650 sugar mills in India, 107 have cogeneration plants. Efficient bagasse cogeneration&#13;
                                  is receiving increased attention in India because of its potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing other&#13;

            Electricity reforms : what some countries
            did right and others can do better
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Since 1982 more than half the
            world's countries have reformed their electricity
            sectors. Implemented correctly, the standard reform model,
            with competition, unbundling, and effective regulation, can
            lead to big gains in performance. But most developing
            countries lack institutional preconditions for fully
            adopting the model, and hybrid electricity markets are
            emerging. Developing pricing schemes that strike a better
            balance between economic efficiency and social equity
            remains a big challenge. An even greater challenge is to
            meet global energy needs while reducing the threat of
            climate change disruption.
