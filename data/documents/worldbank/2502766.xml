Abstract&#13;
This paper examines the extent of non-tariff barriers to sixteen&#13;
industrial countries' visible imports.     Using three alternative measures it&#13;
shows that governmental commodity-specific border-measures affect over 27% of&#13;
all imports and over 34% of imports from developing countries. It also shows&#13;
that during the period 1981 - 83, NTBs became significantly more extensive.&#13;
Detailed statistics reveal considerable variations in NTB coverage by commod-&#13;
ity, type of barrier, importer and exporter. The data on which these conclu-&#13;
sions are based are compiled from official information at the finest level of&#13;
disaggregation; they are described in the paper.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Since the 1940s, considerable progress has been made in liberalizing&#13;
tariff barriers to international trade through a series of multilateral nego-&#13;
tiations. For example, the Tokyo Round concluded in 1979 with an agreement to&#13;
lower industrial countries' tariffs by about 25% on average, and the Geneva&#13;
(1956), Dillon (1962), and Kennedy Rounds (1968) produced similar reduc-&#13;
tions. In consequence, the average level of the tariff of industrial coun-&#13;
tries was reduced from about 40% in the mid-1930s to 4-8% after the Tokyo&#13;
Round.&#13;
As the GATT rounds have brought about a significant decline of tar-&#13;
iffs as obstacles to trade, non-tariff barriers (NTBs) have become more pre-&#13;
valent. The CATT itself, in attempting to limit the imposition of trade&#13;
restrictions, specifically allows countries to impose several kinds of mea-&#13;
sures; e.g., safeguard restrictions, antidumping and countervailing duties.&#13;
In addition, governments and import competing interests have been quite inven-&#13;
tive both in developing and implementing restrictions; e.g., "Voluntary"&#13;
Export Restraints, which are outside of the GATT, and in adding provisions to&#13;
the GATT to sanction widespread restrictions, e.g. on agricultural products,&#13;
when the CATT was initially negotiated, and later, the Multifibre Arrangement&#13;
for textiles and clothing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Behind this paper lies an interest, of course, in moving the inter-&#13;
national community toward liberalization of such restrictions, but we do not&#13;
address directly that topic here. This paper takes up an important pre-&#13;
requisite to such work -- the presentation of credible information on the&#13;
nature and extent of non-tariff barriers in international trade. The&#13;
quantitative work reported here concentrates on a basic dimension, the amount&#13;
of trade "subject to", or "covered by" NTBs. Within this quantitative dimen-&#13;
sion the paper addresses three questions:&#13;
(1) What is the prevalence of the most notable non-tariff barriers on&#13;
industrial countries' imports?&#13;
(2) Has it increased in recent years?&#13;
(3) Are the imports from developing countries particularly subject to&#13;
these NTBs?&#13;
Section I describes the types of NTBs included in this study and&#13;
discusses the sense in which each type is a restriction on international&#13;
trade. Section II discusses the concept, data and statistical indicators&#13;
used, while Sections III to V present the results. Section VI briefly&#13;
compares our results with other recent estimates and finally, Section VII&#13;
provides a summary and conclusions.&#13;

I. NON-TARIFF BARRIERS INCLUDED&#13;
The array of trade practices considered by governments as non-tariff&#13;
barriers to trade is very wide. For example the "Table of Contents of the&#13;
Inventory of Non-Tariff Measures" which is used by the GATT Secretariat in its&#13;
Report of the Group on Quantitative Restrictions and Other Non-Tariff&#13;
Measures, enumerates over 40 categories of measures. In this paper we invest-&#13;
igate a restricted selection of the measures, included in the GATT "Table of&#13;
Contents": specifically those which are (a) product-specific (b) border mea-&#13;
sures and (c) for which comprehensive and internationally comparable data are&#13;
available. While there is room for debate about the composition of a complete&#13;
set of NTBs, our selection, drawn from official definitions and based on&#13;
official sources, represents a minimum list of non-tariff trade policies. It&#13;
comprises five groups of the most common and explicit border measures used to&#13;
control the inflow of foreign goods.&#13;
There are many political and administrative mechanisms through which&#13;
import restrictions are put in place, and many reasons, legal, political, and&#13;
otherwise, why a government might argue against the application of the label&#13;
''protection" or "import regulation" to its policy measures.   In certain cir-&#13;
cumstances the GATT allows the use of some types of import restrictions, but&#13;
whether or not an action is GATT-conforming is not a basis for sorting between&#13;
protection and not protection. Safeguard actions, for example, are GATT-&#13;
conforming, and are universally interpreted as trade restrictions or protec-&#13;
tion. We deal here only with the economics of such measures -- only with the&#13;
fact that they impose conditions on import sales which they (or parallel rules&#13;
and regulations on domestic commerce) do not impose on sales by domestic&#13;
firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
(1) Quantitative import restrictions.&#13;
Prohibitions, embargoes on the importation of a product. A pro-&#13;
hibition may be total, may admit exceptions at the discretion of the competent&#13;
authority, or may operate only under certain conditions.&#13;
Quotas. Ceilings (specified in value or quantitative terms) are im-&#13;
posed on the importation of a product for a given period of time; they may be&#13;
global, country-specific or seasonal.&#13;
Discretionary import authorizations. Permission to import is granted&#13;
at the discretion of competent authorities (customs or other) upon completion&#13;
of an application procedure. These are often used for the administration of&#13;
quantitative limits.&#13;
Conditional import authorizations. Permission to import is subject&#13;
to the importer undertaking commitments in areas other than importation, or to&#13;
specified overaLl economic conditions (e.g. authorization is dependent on&#13;
export performance, or the purchase of an equivalent quantity of domestic out-&#13;
put) or the unavailability of domestic supply.&#13;
(2) "Voluntary" export restraints (VER).&#13;
Agreements between an exporter and an importer as to the maximum&#13;
amount of exports (specified in value or quantity terms) to be effected within&#13;
a given period of time. This category covers, inter alia, measures employed&#13;
for the administration of bilateral agreements on textile trade reached within&#13;
the framework of the Multi-fibre Arrangement (MFA), i.e., specific limits,&#13;
consultation levels, and export controls. 1/&#13;
1/ While voluntary export restrictions are administered by exporting&#13;
countries, they are monitored by the importing country and their impo-&#13;
sition is the result of successful protectionist requests in importing&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(3)  Measures for the enforcement of decreed prices.&#13;
Variable levies. Variable import charges serving to equalize the&#13;
c.i.f. import price with a decreed price.&#13;
Minimum price systems. A minimum import price is set by the import-&#13;
ing country, and import prices below the decreed minimum trigger an additional&#13;
duty or some other penalty.&#13;
"Voluntary" export price restraints. This category covers agreements&#13;
between the exporter and the importer on the minimum price to be observed by&#13;
the exporter.&#13;
(4) Tariff-type measures.&#13;
Tariff quotas. Two tariff rates are applied, the higher rate coming&#13;
into operation when the quantity of imported goods exceeds a specified level.&#13;
Seasonal tariffs. Different tariff rates are applied to the same&#13;
(agricultural) product according to the time of year.&#13;
(5) Monitoring measures.&#13;
Price and volume investigations, surveillance. Such practices are&#13;
usually associated with charges by domestic producers about unfair trading&#13;
practices of an exporting country. While an investigation is obviously neces-&#13;
sary to determine the facts, there is evidence that the inquiry process itself&#13;
has a protective effect, independent of the eventual findings (Finger, 1981).&#13;
The investigative process or continued surveillance generates uncertainty&#13;
about the exporter's continuing access to the market, and creates an incentive&#13;
to raise his price, whether or not guilty of a legally unfair practice. A&#13;
surveillance process is often the means by which a government monitors "vol-&#13;
untary" price maintenance agreements or volume restraint agreements contracted&#13;
between exporting and import-competing industries or governments. Surveil-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
untary" price maintenance agreements or volume restraint agreements contracted&#13;
between exporting and import-competing industries or governments. Surveil-&#13;
lance is often the precursor to more formal import restrictions, 1/ or a&#13;
signal to exporters to practice "self-restraint" to avoid a more formal "vol-&#13;
untary restraint." "Automatic" licensing procedures are often restrictive,&#13;
e.g., they serve to police bans on imports from certain countries, or to&#13;
funnel all imports of a product through a government authorized association of&#13;
import-competing local producers of that product, or of a finished good made&#13;
from that product.&#13;
Anti-dumping and countervailing duties. In theory, anti-dumping&#13;
duties are levied on a product that is sold in the importing country at a&#13;
lower price than in the exporting country, and countervailing duties are&#13;
levied to offset rebates or subsidies provided for the production of a good&#13;
for export. As to whether or not such trade practice regulations bear more&#13;
heavily on import sales than on sales by domestic producers, William Dickey&#13;
(1979) has explained for the United States several ways in which such rules on&#13;
import sales practices are more restrictive than is comparable "domestic"&#13;
(mainly anti-trust) law of domestic firms' sales practices. There is also&#13;
evidence that the outcome of the pricing test in dumping and countervailing&#13;
duty cases is significantly influenced by economic variables usually used (in&#13;
the parallel injury test) to measure injury, i.e., that the economics of&#13;
dumping and countervailing duties is much the same as the economics of&#13;
safeguards cases [Finger, Hall &amp; Nelson, 1982].&#13;
1/ Indeed European Economic Community regulations [e.g., Council regulation&#13;
(EEC) 288/82] explicitly refer to surveillance for this purpose. (See the&#13;
Official Journal of the European Communities, 1982.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
While our selection of NTBs includes a broad range of policies, it&#13;
still constitutes only a sub-set of the trade restrictions included in the&#13;
GATT and UNCTAD lists. 1/ For example, it does not include domestic policy&#13;
measures (e.g. subsidies to import competing sectors, government procurement,&#13;
restrictions on domestic sale of foreign goods), generalized procedures apply-&#13;
ing to all imports, restrictive business practices, the use of technical or&#13;
sanitary requirements as barriers to trade, or subtle forms of import&#13;
restrictions such as changing ports of entry, any of which could affect&#13;
international trade dramatically.&#13;

II. MEASUREMENTS OF NTB COVERAGE&#13;
The basic unit of measure used in this study is the amount, of share&#13;
of a country's imports subject to NTB. Operationally, this concept is quanti-&#13;
fied by marking on each line of a country's import list, which types of NTBs&#13;
are applied to that line. Many such restrictions are not "global" or&#13;
"m.f.n.", and apply only to imports from particular countries, hence the&#13;
import list must be disaggregated by both product and country of origin. The&#13;
sums of imports over lines "subject to NTB" divided by the sums over "all"&#13;
import lines are the NTB prevalence or coverage ratios which we will pre-&#13;
sent. Details are provided below.&#13;
The prevalence or coverage ratio is a more elementary concept than a&#13;
tariff average; a more appropriate parallel is the ratio of dutiable to total&#13;
(dutiable plus duty free) imports. While a tariff rate provides a measure of&#13;
the "intensity" of restriction it entails, non-tariff measures provide us&#13;
with no such "natural" measure of intensity, nor has the analysis of NTBs yet&#13;
brought us to the point where we have an estimated set of intensity figures&#13;
for NTBs. We have only a "Yes or No" indicator -- a strictly qualitative&#13;
indicator of whether or not governmental considerations, as opposed to just&#13;
normal commercial considerations, influence the amount or the direction of&#13;
international trade.&#13;
The Statistical Indicators&#13;
Three indices of the prevalence of NTBs are used below. Each&#13;
summarizes the presence or absence of NTBs on several tariff headings&#13;
simultaneously, but each uses a different scheme to combine observations. For&#13;
any importer (i) and type of non-tariff barrier (b) let&#13;
N   = 1 if there is a barrier on imports of "q" from exporter "x"&#13;
qx&#13;
= 0 otherwise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
For sets of commodities (Q) and exporters (X), all three indices take the&#13;
form:&#13;
E    Z   W   N&#13;
qeQ  xcX   qx   qx&#13;
qEQ XeX   qx&#13;
While one might wish to combine NTBs with reference to the amount by&#13;
which they reduce trade, or to the levels that trade would attain in the ab-&#13;
sence of NTBs, this is not possible. Neither of these is observable. Indeed,&#13;
one purpose of developing an NTB coverage index is to move us toward estimat-&#13;
ing the trade effects of these NTBs, toward construction of the counterfactual&#13;
"free trade" pattern of imports. 1/&#13;
The Own Imports Coverage Ratio (I c): defines Wqx as the value of i's actual&#13;
imports of q from x.&#13;
The World Trade Coverage Ratio (1w): defines Wqx as the value of world imports&#13;
of q, shared over exporters (x) according to i's actual imports. (See&#13;
Appendix 1 for details).&#13;
The Frequency Ratio (If): defines Wqx as the presence or absence of a flow of&#13;
q from x to i; thus&#13;
Wqx = 1 if imports of q from x are non-zero,&#13;
= 0 otherwise.&#13;
1/ There are many jokes about economists assuming away the problem, and the&#13;
suggestion that the coverage ratio be based on "free trade" values is an&#13;
example of why such jokes have an element of valid criticism in them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Note that while both Nqx and Wqx must refer to particular years, these need&#13;
not be the same, provided that, as here, both have been converted to the same&#13;
classification. 1/&#13;
Each of the three indices has strengths and weaknesses. The own&#13;
imports coverage ratio is possibly the most natural, in that the extent of an&#13;
NTB is represented by the size of the particular trade flows it affects. Its&#13;
drawback is that more restrictive NTBs tend to receive lower weight than less&#13;
restrictive ones, because they reduce imports by more. In the extreme, a&#13;
total prohibition shows up as zero imports covered by NTBs. This difficulty&#13;
is reduced by allowing Wqx to refer to a year in which there were relatively&#13;
few barriers.&#13;
To the degree that a country's own restrictions are not correlated&#13;
with those on world trade, then the weight that the world trade coverage ratio&#13;
applies to a particular NTB will be largely independent of the latter's re-&#13;
strictiveness. If, on the other hand, all importers restrict a particular&#13;
commodity (e.g. textiles), its weight in world trade will still be under-&#13;
stated relative to the free trade case and the NTBs it faces correspondingly&#13;
underweighted in the overall index. The drawbacks of Iw as a measure of the&#13;
"free trade" coverage of individual countries' NTBs are, first, that world&#13;
imports may not be representative of the import pattern of a particular im-&#13;
porter, because import bundles differ from country to country quite independ-&#13;
ently of the level of NTBs, and, second, the inevitable inaccuracies in&#13;
1/  UNCTAD converts NTB information from the trade classification current when&#13;
they are reported to the 1981 classification used for the trade data. To&#13;
the extent that this is occassionally impossible our figures may slightly&#13;
understate the prevalence of NTBs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
estimating world trade for each tariff-line of each importer's trade class-&#13;
ification (see Appendix 1 of Nogues, Olechowski and Winters (1985) for&#13;
details).&#13;
Most current protection is of recent origin and is intended to&#13;
prevent further increases in import shares, rather than to drastically roll&#13;
back imports. Moreover, most industrial countries do tend to protect the same&#13;
sectors, e.g. agriculture, textiles and iron and steel. Thus, when comparing&#13;
NTB coverage between countries, we believe that "own imports" is a better&#13;
proxy for free trade imports than are our constructed "world trade" data.&#13;
The frequency ratio goes still further towards avoiding the downward&#13;
bias in Ic relative to free trade imports coverage. The extent of NTBs is&#13;
measured by the number of trade flows that are affected, so that every barrier&#13;
on every observed trade flow receives equal weight. 1/ Its difficulties are&#13;
twofold, however. First, it ignores the perfectly natural differences in the&#13;
sizes of different trade flows, and second, it is exaggerated by the tendency&#13;
of trade classifications to become more fragmented the more sensitive and&#13;
restricted is a category of trade.&#13;
None of our indices allows for the fact that some barriers are&#13;
inherently more restrictive than others. For example, discretionary licenses&#13;
could involve only the threat of a restriction or a very direct one, but our&#13;
l/ The use of "observed" trade flows means that prohibitions are still&#13;
excluded in If.   This could be overcome by defining W    as unity wherever&#13;
N   = 1, even if actual imports were zero.    This invoives a certain&#13;
aqitrariness, however, since it is not guaranteed that every zero trade&#13;
subject to an NTB would be positive in the absence of the NTB. For&#13;
example, suppose an importer has a global quota of zero on bananas: thus&#13;
N   = 1 for all x, when q = bananas.    While we may like to have Wqx = 1&#13;
f3xr Trinidad, we would not wish it so for Iceland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
measures are insensitive to such dimensions. Thus it remains a large and&#13;
speculative step to draw conclusions about the restrictiveness of trade&#13;
regimes on the strength of these indices.&#13;
In making comparisons of NTB coverage across time, we use import&#13;
values from one period to calculate NTB coverage for both periods. Thus we&#13;
get a reliable indicator of changes of the extent of NTB but, as the reader&#13;
has been reminded before, not of the changes in their restrictiveness.&#13;
The data&#13;
The import data used in construction of the coverage ratios are&#13;
provided by national authorities to the GATT and thence to UNCTAD. These data&#13;
classify imports by tariff-line and distinguish trade with all partner coun-&#13;
tries, except for EEC countries, where intra-Community trade is ignored. All&#13;
trade data are annual and refer to 1981.&#13;
Sixteen industrial country markets are examined in this paper: the&#13;
ten EEC countries (with Belgium and Luxembourg combined), Australia, Austria,&#13;
Finland, Japan, Norway, Switzerland and the USA. In 1981 these markets&#13;
accounted for about 60% of total world imports and about 70% of imports from&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
The data on non-tariff barriers have been collected by UNCTAD within&#13;
the framework of its Data Base on Trade Measures. This contains, inter alia,&#13;
information on governmental product-specific border non-tariff measures ap-&#13;
plied in most developed market-economy countries. The data are recorded at&#13;
the tariff-line level (i.e. at the level at which they are applied), and are&#13;
derived from official national and intergovernmental (e.g. GATT)&#13;
publications. After the preliminary collection of information, or if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
substantive changes are introduced, governments are invited to verify and&#13;
comment upon the accuracy of the data on their import regimes. 1/&#13;
The UNCTAD data contain information on the dates of introduction and&#13;
elimination (if applicable) of individual NTBs, thus enabling the&#13;
investigation of changes in NTB import coverage over time. Our estimates&#13;
refer to periods of one year, and we set Nqx = 1 for a barrier even if it has&#13;
been in application for only part of the period concerned. This possibly&#13;
imparts an upward bias to our ratios, but it allows us to capture a more&#13;
representative sample of short-term and seasonal barriers than would a "snap-&#13;
shot" view.&#13;

III. RESULTS, NTBs ON INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES' IMPORTS&#13;
Tables A-C summarize the prevalence in 16 industrial economies of the&#13;
NTBs we have been able to document. The discussion in this section will be&#13;
focused on aggregate results. However, the Annex provides detailed figures&#13;
underlying the text tables and discussion of this section. 1/&#13;
Overall Prevalence of NTBs&#13;
Overall, 13% of these countries' tariff lines are subject to NTBs,&#13;
and 27% of their imports fall into these categories. In comparison, tariff&#13;
concessions negotiated at the Tokyo Round covered about 18% of the imports of&#13;
the major developed countries. 1/ The value of imports influenced by the non-&#13;
tariff trade policies of these 16 country governments (some $231 billion,&#13;
based on 1981 trade flows) is almost half as large again as the total imports&#13;
of the state-trading East European centrally planned countries.&#13;
1/ Text tables below are referred to by letter, annex tables by number. Each&#13;
annex table is replicated for own imports coverage ratios (C), world&#13;
imports coverage ratios (W) and frequency ratios (F).&#13;
1/ The total value of trade affected by m.f.n. tariff reductions and bindings&#13;
at prevailing rates amounted to 17.8% ($125 billion) of 1976 imports of&#13;
the major developed import markets (see GATT (1979) p.118).&#13;

Sectoral Coverage&#13;
While NTBs affect almost all internationally traded goods, 1/ Table A&#13;
shows that in the case of industrial countries they are especially prevalent&#13;
in certain sectors. In particular, agricultural products, textiles, mineral&#13;
fuels and iron and steel generally show a greater prevalence of NTBs than&#13;
other product groups. It is quite common for imports of agricultural products&#13;
to be regulated to such an extent that their origin, quantity, quality, price&#13;
and time of entry are specified in advance by the importing country&#13;
authorities. While the management of imports is particularly elaborate in the&#13;
EEC, where, for example, minimum import prices for certain products are&#13;
adjusted almost daily, agricultural products face a wide array of NTBs in all&#13;
industrial countries. Among the measures employed are various kinds of quotas&#13;
(global, bilateral, seasonal), varying (seasonal) tariff duties, minimum&#13;
import prices and import authorizations including permits dependent, for&#13;
example on the purchase of equivalent quantities of locally grown products.&#13;
Their use is so widespread that in Switzerland they cover 73% of imports, in&#13;
Austria and Japan 42%, in Australia 36%, etc.&#13;
Even so, agriculture is certainly a case where our indices under-&#13;
estimate the extent of NTBs. First, we do not account for such measures as&#13;
quality standards or state trading, which are particularly frequent in&#13;
agriculture and can restrict imports just as effectively as volume or price&#13;
1/ For example, about 98% of 4-digit CCCN product groups face some sort of&#13;
volume restriction somewhere in the world and often in more than one&#13;
country (UNCTAD (1983a) p.11).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
measures. Second, existing trade restrictions are quite strenuous, 1/ and&#13;
hence tend to push both the own imports and world imports coverage ratios&#13;
downward; international trade in those agricultural products currently subject&#13;
to restriction would certainly be considerably greater under free trade.&#13;
Textile imports face NTBs to the same or higher degree than&#13;
agriculture. Most international trade in textiles and clothing is governed by&#13;
the MFA, an umbrella arrangement under which voluntary export restraints of a&#13;
varying restrictiveness are negotiated between (industrial country) importers&#13;
and (developing country) exporters. Countries which do not apply MFA&#13;
restrictions, resort to other devices: for example, Australia imposes tariff&#13;
quotas (with higher rates set at the prohibitive levels), Switzerland applies&#13;
automatic licensing and monitors prices of products from certain suppliers,&#13;
and Norway applied (until July 1984, when it introduced MFA measures) global&#13;
quotas.&#13;
As in the case of agriculture, our indices probably underestimate the&#13;
extent of NTBs on textiles. First, textile measures are generally highly&#13;
restrictive. For example, under the current MFA the annual growth rate of the&#13;
US imports from Hong Kong is limited to 1.5% for textiles and 0.7% for&#13;
clothing, while EEC imports of textiles from Colombia are allowed to grow by&#13;
0.3% and from Mexico by 0.1%. As recently concluded by the CATT Textiles&#13;
Surveillance Body, "under MFA III, restraints have been more extensive and in&#13;
many cases more restrictive [than under MFA II]. Most importing countries, in&#13;
restraining imports under the MFA, had recourse to extensive invocation of&#13;
1/ See, for example, Bale and Koester (1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
'exceptional circumstances' or of the need to maintain 'minimum viable&#13;
production"'. 1/&#13;
Second, volume and price restrictions are frequently accompanied and&#13;
reinforced by other measures, particularly requirements of origin, which our&#13;
indices do not include. Recent instances suggest that these measures are&#13;
becoming progressively more restrictive, e.g., the new "Customs Regulating&#13;
Amendments Relating to Textiles and Textile Products" in the USA, which&#13;
provide more stringent guidelines for the determination of the origin of&#13;
textile imports.&#13;
Contrary to a popular belief that raw materials are free of trade&#13;
barriers, mineral fuels are among the product groups subject to a close&#13;
government control. The average coverage ratio for fuels is a high 42.9&#13;
reflecting licensing or quota requirements for all or selected imports of&#13;
hydrocarbons into the USA, Finland, Australia, Norway, Switzerland and&#13;
France. For example, in France petroleum imports are subject to a global&#13;
quota. In the US a license is required for imports of natural gas, petroleum&#13;
and all petroleum products. In all these categories the licensing is "inten-&#13;
ded to restrict the quantity of imports", 2/ and in the case of natural gas&#13;
to exclude those imports which are not "consistent with the public inter-&#13;
est". 3/   Due to falling consumption, current petroleum imports are not&#13;
formally restricted, but the authority to license imports enables government&#13;
to affect its direction, e.g., imports into the US from Libya are prohibited.&#13;
1/ CATT (1984a) p.10.&#13;
2/ See GATT (1983) p.10.&#13;
3/ See Section 3 of the United States Natural Gas Act (1938).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
The fourth product group strongly affected by non-tariff barriers is&#13;
iron and steel. Relatively free in the 1970s, iron and steel imports have&#13;
become - in a remarkably short period of time - almost as tightly regulated as&#13;
textile trade, particularly in the EEC, USA and Australia. These three econ-&#13;
omies maintain elaborate "umbrellas" shielding their structurally ailing&#13;
industry from foreign competition. The EEC closely monitors its imports&#13;
through the system of automatic licenses "to ensure that traditional trade&#13;
patterns in steel products are not disturbed"; 1/ a number of "voluntary"&#13;
export arrangements limit imports from the major suppliers, and minimum&#13;
("basic") import prices are established for selected products.&#13;
In the US, additional duties and a global quota were imposed on the&#13;
imports of specialty steel in 1983 and subsequently a number of "voluntary"&#13;
export arrangements have been concluded with major suppliers. 2/ For certain&#13;
carbon and alloy steel products a maximum level of import penetration was set&#13;
(18.5%) and is enforced by "voluntary" export and "surge control" arrangements&#13;
with major suppliers and countries whose exports have increased rapidly.&#13;
Finally in Australia, the Steel Industry Plan provides, inter alia,&#13;
for an "import watch system" and reviews of levels of protection (which relies&#13;
on tariffs and bounties) if the domestic producers' market share falls below&#13;
80% or rises above 90% in specified product categories.&#13;
1/ GATT (1984) p.4.&#13;
2/ To "encourage" such agreements the US has advised its suppliets that the&#13;
global quota would be divided between countries which concluded orderly&#13;
marketing arrangements with only a small part (about 5%) left for other&#13;
producers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
A common feature of the iron and steel protection is a frequent&#13;
resort by all the countries to anti-dumping and countervailing actions. For&#13;
example in 1982, 149 cases were initiated in the USA, 19 in the EEC and 13 in&#13;
Australia. 1/ Anti-dumping and countervailing duty actions (along with&#13;
Section 301 actions) are explicitly provided for in the Presidential decision&#13;
on the protection for the US steel industry, while a "fast track dumping&#13;
mechanism" is one of the elements of the Australian Steel Industry Plan. 2/&#13;
Both are examples of a measure established to regulate trade practices being&#13;
applied to problems of a structural character.&#13;
Other product groups are less restricted by NTBs. The relatively&#13;
high ratios for vehicles reflect "voluntary" export arrangements on Japanese&#13;
exports and surveillance of car imports in the EEC. Ratios for footwear and&#13;
electrical machinery are moderate. This latter group includes electronics&#13;
which (particularly from Japan, Republic of Korea and Hong Kong) meet&#13;
increasing restrictions. However, due to the still relatively low value of&#13;
trade in this category and the selective nature of import restrictions&#13;
(usually "voluntary" export restraints or quotas by country) the ratios for&#13;
the whole group of electrical products are not large.&#13;
1/ See UNCTAD (1984a) p.8.&#13;
2/ See Industries Assistance Commission (1984) pp.21-27.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Types of Barriers&#13;
Table B gives the break-down of NTBs by type. 1/ Quantitative import&#13;
restrictions and monitoring measures are the most pervasive of barriers&#13;
according to all three indices. Since the latter are predominately concerned&#13;
with the quantity of imports, it seems that qualitative measures far outweigh&#13;
price measures in the set of NTBs.&#13;
More revealing than the aggregate picture of Table B is the separate&#13;
analysis of types of barrier for agriculture and manufactures found in Tables&#13;
5 and 6 of Annex A. It is obvious that different policies are emphasized in&#13;
different sectors. Agricultural protection comprises mainly price measures&#13;
and quantitative restrictions. The former are particularly important in the&#13;
EEC, where much trade is subject to variable levies, but in other countries&#13;
direct quantity restrictions are relatively more important, see, for example&#13;
Japan, where over 46% of imports from developing countries or in Switzerland&#13;
where 47% of imports from industrial countries are affected. Manufacturing is&#13;
primarily protected by quantity measures and monitoring measures. In Europe&#13;
surveillance is common - much of it quite explicitly warning exporters to&#13;
restrain themselves (see footnote 1 on page 6 above) - but so too are more&#13;
rigid restrictions in the form of quantitative restrictions and VERs. The&#13;
USA's protection of manufacturing appears to be both more limited and more&#13;
subtle, relying almost exclusively on monitoring through mechanisms intended&#13;
to police trade practices, and "voluntary" agreements. Japan's manufactured&#13;
imports appear to face very few barriers of the type discussed here.&#13;
1/ The sums of the ratios across groups of measures frequently exceed the&#13;
totals quoted. This is because single trade flows are often subject to&#13;
NTBs of two or more classes. Such flows are counted once for each class&#13;
and once (only) for the total.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Country Comparisons&#13;
All three indices in Table C point to France, Australia and Switzer-&#13;
land as the countries where NTBs are most prevalent, while the two coverage&#13;
ratios are also high for Finland and the USA. However when fuels are excluded&#13;
from the product coverage the US and Finland shift to the group of countries&#13;
with small or moderate ratios. Thus, NTBs on fuels are the prime source of&#13;
their high coverage indices.&#13;
Whether or not restrictions on imports of fuels are taken into ac-&#13;
count, France, Australia and Switzerland remain among the countries with the&#13;
highest NTB ratios. For the first two this is a reflection of an extensive&#13;
system of quotas and licensing. Tables 2F and 2C indicate that about 10% of&#13;
import flows accounting for over 47% of imports face these measures in France&#13;
and about 13% of import flows or 27% of imports in Australia. Quantitative&#13;
restrictions are also significant in Switzerland (8% of import flows or 12% of&#13;
import value is subject to these restrictions) but the most extensive barrier&#13;
is the system of automatic licensing which covers about 11% of import flows&#13;
and 32% of total imports.&#13;
Imports of Austria and Norway appear to be facing relatively few&#13;
border non-tariff barriers, but both countries apply other import measures&#13;
such as state trading, import charges, technical standards as well as grant&#13;
direct assistance to several import-competing industries. In addition,&#13;
Austria maintains relatively high tariff duties. 1/&#13;
1/ Post Tokyo Round weighted average ratio is 10.1% compared with 3.6%&#13;
average for major developed economies (see Olechowski, A. and Yeats, A.&#13;
[1982], p.81).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
The NTB ratios are also relatively low for Italy and Japan. Italy&#13;
appears to apply fewer but tighter border measures than other EEC countries,&#13;
for her frequency ratios consistantly and significantly exceed her import&#13;
coverage ratios. Japan, as is well known, is often suspected of using meas-&#13;
ures not covered in our exercise -- e.g., testing procedures, restrictions on&#13;
retail outlets for foreign products, administrative guidances -- to restrict&#13;
imports.&#13;
In comparing the NTB coverage figures between countries the reader&#13;
should remember that the information we have measures the extent of NTBs, and&#13;
not the restrictiveness. It would be inappropriate to use these figures to&#13;
argue that countries with higher indices "owe" the international community a&#13;
unilateral "round" of trade liberalization, or that a country with a low&#13;
coverage index is justified in imposing restrictions against its trading&#13;
partners.&#13;

IV. THE EXTENT OF NTBs ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' EXPORTS&#13;
Having discussed the prevalence of NTBs in aggregate we now turn to&#13;
the question of whether NTBs impinge more heavily on the exports of developing&#13;
countries than on intra-industrial country trade. The indices in Table D are&#13;
aggregates over the 16 industrial markets for which we have NTB information,&#13;
and present NTB coverage ratios for imports from four groups of exporters -&#13;
industrial countries, all developing countries, major developing country&#13;
exporters of manufactures, and major borrowers (these groupings are defined in&#13;
the Annex).&#13;
Table D shows that NTBs are significantly more prevalent on imports&#13;
from developing countries than from industrial countries, and this is repli-&#13;
cated for nearly all individual markets (see Table 3).&#13;
Table D&#13;

World Imports           17.1      27.0          24.6                29.4&#13;
Frequency Ratio             8.8      18.6          18.1                19.4&#13;
Not only the relative, but also the absolute, extent of NTB coverage&#13;
is larger in the case of developing countries' products.   For example, the&#13;
value (in 1981 terms) of imports from developing countries subject to NTBs is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
US$ 86 billion compared with US$ 79 billion in the case of imports from&#13;
industrial countries.&#13;
Another important implication of Table D is that NTBs are relatively&#13;
extensive on the exports of the developing country major borrowers. For these&#13;
countries all three indices assume values which are 1-2 percentage points&#13;
higher than those for all developing countries and 7-8 percentage points&#13;
higher than those for all exporters. This difference is partly due to the&#13;
presence of three large oil exporters (Indonesia, Mexico and Venezuela) among&#13;
the major borrowers. However, even if fuels are excluded, the coverage&#13;
indices for major borrowers remain higher than those for all developing&#13;
countries while the frequency ratio is marginally lower. 1/ Given that the&#13;
major borrowers' ability to cope with current balance of payments difficulties&#13;
depends to a large degree on their ability to export to the industrial coun-&#13;
tries, these figures emphasise how closely linked are debt and trade policy&#13;
issues.&#13;
In the case of major exporters of manufactures, the evidence is less&#13;
clear cut. It is often alleged that the newly industralized countries are the&#13;
prime targets of protective actions, but the figures in Table D do not support&#13;
this thesis. However, when fuels are excluded the values of all three indices&#13;
for the exporters of manufactures are higher than for all developing&#13;
countries. 2/&#13;
1/ The respective values are: 25.5 (own imports coverage ratio), 24.0 (world&#13;
imports coverage ratio) and 18.1 (frequency ratio) for major borrowers and&#13;
22.4, 22.7 and 18.5 for all developing exporters.&#13;
2/ They are: 23.8 (own imports coverage ratio), 24.5 (world imports coverage&#13;
ratio) and 19.4 (frequency ratio).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
The structure of the apparent discrimination against developing&#13;
countries is explored in Table E and Annex Table 4. It shows that almost&#13;
universally NTBs are less prevalent on industrial countries' imports of&#13;
agricultural goods from developing countries than on those from other&#13;
industrial countries, but that the reverse is true for manufactures.&#13;
Nonetheless, developing countries still generally face more barriers on&#13;
agricultural exports than on manufactures, and since agriculture accounts for&#13;
a higher share of imports from developing countries than from industrial ones,&#13;
agricultural protection still contributes to the differential incidence at the&#13;
aggregate level. In the manufacturing sector developing countries face more&#13;
barriers than industrial countries where their exports are large, e.g., in&#13;
textiles and footwear, and fewer where they are small, e.g., in electrical&#13;
machinery and vehicles.&#13;

A striking feature of Table 6 of the Annex is much greater prevalence&#13;
of VER on imports of manufactures from developing countries than on those from&#13;
industrial countries. For example, the overall world imports coverage ratio&#13;
of VERs for developing countries' manufactures is 10.9% compared with 0.4% for&#13;
industrial countries, and this pattern is repeated for every market with&#13;
VERs. While our figures do not reflect the restrictiveness of trade regimes&#13;
at all accurately, the evidence of a widespread bias in the application of&#13;
voluntary export restraints seems overwhelming.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. THE GROWTH OF NTBs&#13;
The final issue we examine is the expansion of NTB coverage through&#13;
time. Table F and Table 7 of the Annex present changes in the coverage of&#13;
NTBs between 1981 and 1983. The UNCTAD Data Base does not provide precise&#13;
information on the dates of introduction before 1981 and, at the time our&#13;
investigation was carried out, did not contain data on measures imposed after&#13;
June 1984.&#13;

Frequency Ratio                 0.3              0.1                 0.9&#13;
All three measures indicate that NTBs are encroaching progressively&#13;
further on international trade. For the 16 markets whose NTBs have been tab-&#13;
ulated, there was, between 1981 and 1983, a net increase of 2,486 in the num-&#13;
ber of NTBs recorded. The NTBs in place in 1983 covered $12.8 billion more of&#13;
1981's imports than did those in place in 1981. This additional $12.8 billion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
which came under NTBs was approximately 1.5% of these countries' total imports&#13;
in 1981, and approximately 6% of the value of imports subject to NTBs. Note&#13;
that these figures refer only to new NTBs and not to any tightening or rein-&#13;
forcement of existing ones.&#13;
According to the coverage ratios, the new measures seem to be aimed&#13;
mostly at imports from the industrial countries. 1/ When the coverage and&#13;
frequency indicators are compared, it appears that new NTBs were imposed on a&#13;
larger number of small trade flows from developing countries and a smaller&#13;
number of large flows from industrial countries. This is a reflection of&#13;
concentration of new NTBs in areas such as iron and steel and electrical&#13;
machinery, where developing countries are only now entering international&#13;
trade. This pattern does not mean, however, that developing countries were&#13;
exempt from the rise in protectionism, for their main exports (such as&#13;
textiles and clothing) experienced considerable tightening of the existing&#13;
restrictions.&#13;

VI. THE COMPARISON OF EXISTING ESTIMATES OF NTB COVERAGE&#13;
While this study is a first attempt to estimate NTB prevalence in a&#13;
comprehensive and precise fashion, there do exist some approximations in the&#13;
literature. This section compares our results, with those of Balassa and&#13;
Balassa (1984), Cline (1985) and Jones (1983).&#13;
Balassa and Blassa define NTBs relatively narrowly - quotas, licens-&#13;
ing, voluntary export restraints, orderly marketing agreements, safeguard&#13;
measures and "restrictive application of standards" - and use 4-digit SITC(R)&#13;
NTB data from the US Special Trade Representative's Office. Their trade sta-&#13;
tistics - at 4-digit SITC(R) level - refer to 1980 and come from the World&#13;
Bank Trade System. Balassa and Balassa!s higher level of aggregation tends to&#13;
bias their estimates of coverage upward. However, when we recalculate our&#13;
figures on their definitions (see Table 8 of the Annex); the results are&#13;
rather similar, so in this case the bias appears small.&#13;
A second comparison is with Cline (1985). Cline's figures, displayed&#13;
in Table 9 of the Annex, suggest very much higher estimates than our own,&#13;
despite his restricted definition of NTBs (decreed price measures plus&#13;
quantity measures). However, he works with very aggregated NTB and trade&#13;
data: 4-digit ISIC level. His exaggeration of the extent of protectionism&#13;
probably arises from:&#13;
(i)    the high level of his commodity aggregation (the ISIC contains just&#13;
81 4-digit manufacturing categories);&#13;
(ii)   the combination of NTBs from a series of years - "broadly the&#13;
middle 1970s to 1981"! (In fact, in no single year did all the NTBs&#13;
Cline records for the USA apply); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(iii) the counting of all imports of a good as "affected" even if trade&#13;
with only certain partners is restricted. (For example, the UK VER&#13;
with Japan over car imports, leads Cline to include all vehicle&#13;
imports in his measure - even buses imported from Germanyl)&#13;
A final comparison is with Jones' (1983) figures for the UK in 1980&#13;
(see Table 10 Annex). Jones uses a tighter definition of NTBs than ourselves&#13;
- even if we exclude our "other import management measures" group - but he&#13;
does work with tariff-line data. Taking account of differences in produce and&#13;
country groupings, his results match our 1981 estimates quite closely.&#13;

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Given the lack of sound empirical evidence on the extent of non-&#13;
tariff barriers, this paper has attempted to identify some basic features of&#13;
the situation.  By employing the most comprehensive and detailed existing NTB&#13;
and trade information and calculating three indices of the prevalence of NTBs,&#13;
we have generated the most comprehensive analysis extant.&#13;
Four major conclusions emerge from the results. First, the extent of&#13;
NTBs is indeed large. At least 27% of the sixteen major industrial economies'&#13;
imports, some $230 billion of 1981 imports, would have been covered by one or&#13;
more of the selected NTBs as they applied in 1983. NTBs are particularly&#13;
widespread in agricultural products, textile and clothing, mineral fuels and&#13;
iron and steel.&#13;
Second, volume controls appear to be the most prevalent of individual&#13;
NTBs -- much more so than price controls which are applied mainly to agricul-&#13;
tural imports.&#13;
Three different measures indicate that NTBs are significantly more&#13;
prevalent on imports from developing countries than from industrial coun-&#13;
tries. The NTBs applied in 1983 by the sixteen industrial markets examined&#13;
here would have covered $86 billion of imports from developing countries and&#13;
$79 billion of imports from industrial economies. Particularly significant is&#13;
the higher coverage of the exports of developing country major borrowers,&#13;
In relative terms developing countries face more barriers than&#13;
industrial countries in manufactured trade and less in agricultural trade.&#13;
However, developing countries still generally encounter more barriers on&#13;
agricultural exports than on manufactures, and since agriculture accounts for&#13;
a higher share of their exports than of industrial countries' exports9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
protection in this sector contributes to the differential incidence observed&#13;
at the aggregate level.&#13;
Finally, the results provide evidence that NTBs are encroaching&#13;
progressively further on international trade and at a significant pace. In&#13;
the period 1981-1983, a net increase of 2,486 NTBs, covering $12.8 billion of&#13;
1981 imports was observed. Since this increase does not reflect the&#13;
tightening or reinforcement of already existing measures, the growth of NTBs&#13;
should be taken very seriously.&#13;

APPENDIX 1&#13;
World Trade Weights for the Weighted Coverage Ratio&#13;
Index Iw, the Weighted coverage ratio, is based on world trade&#13;
weights, but naturally the data for such weights are not available on each&#13;
country's own detailed trade classification. We derived them as follows.&#13;
First 1981 import data from the World Bank System at the 4-digit level of the&#13;
SITC(R) were summed across the 102 importers for which they existed ("the&#13;
world" - see table A.1). These were converted to a 5-digit SITC(R) basis by&#13;
pro-rating each 4-digit total over its component 5-digit groups according to&#13;
shares derived from the sample of countries reporting 5-digit data for that&#13;
category. (This sample varied by 4-digit groups, but its trade invariably&#13;
covered at least 75% of the 4-digit world total). These 5-digit SITC(R) data&#13;
were then converted to a 4-digit CCCN basis (Z.) using a converter supplied by&#13;
UNCTAD, and then used to update each country's own tariff-line data as&#13;
follows:&#13;
X..&#13;
Xik   ijk&#13;
ijx  Xijk&#13;
where XiJkx is i's imports from x of tariff item k within CCCN sub-group j,&#13;
and Xijkx is the updated 'world' version of this.&#13;
In the notation of the text, Wqx for country i is set to Xir'x where&#13;
tariff index q corresponds to tariff item s within CCCN sub-group r. Thus we&#13;
are weighting CCCN sub-groups together by world trade weights&#13;
(UEE  X.   = Z.),  while using a country's own trade weights for both the&#13;
imn  ijmn     i&#13;
composition and direction of trade with the sub-group. Thus while the world&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
index Iw makes allowances for differences in the restrictiveness of barriers&#13;
on broad groups of goods, it makes no such allowance for differences in the&#13;
restrictiveness of barriers on different tariff-items or sources within the&#13;
broader groups. In particular, this approach implies that if some Xijkx were&#13;
zero, so too would be the corresponding "world" weight Xijkx. Thus&#13;
prohibitions still receive zero wieghts in Iw. The total of Xijkx is world&#13;
imports and is the same for each of the countries treated above.&#13;
For very small proportions of each country's trade the classification&#13;
convertions from CCCN to tariff-line were not straight-forward. They were&#13;
treated as follows.&#13;
(A) Non-USA Data&#13;
Several headings in each of the non-USA national trade statistics&#13;
were not matched in our SITC-CCCN converter.&#13;
CCCN 0407 equated to UN Special Code SITC(R) 0990 (edible animal products&#13;
n.e.s.)&#13;
CCCN 3507 received half of SITC(R) 51291 the other half going to&#13;
CCCN 2940&#13;
CCCN 7107, 7108 gold - no corresponding SITC(R) world data. Their share&#13;
in total imports was kept the same in the adjusted (world&#13;
weighted) and the unadjusted (national) trade data-sets.&#13;
(B) EEC Data&#13;
For EEC countries further difficulties comprised:&#13;
NIMEXE 736n and 737n n= 01....9.   These are a subdivision of CCCN 7315&#13;
(iron and steel). Trade allocated by the converter to CCCN 7315 was&#13;
spread over 7315, 736n and 737n using national shares.&#13;
NIMEXE nn97   postal trade                    Shares in total imports were&#13;
nn98  ships stores                     kept the same in the adjusted&#13;
NIMEXE nn99  unidentified                     (world weighted) series as&#13;
0090  unidentified                     in the unadjusted (national)&#13;
series.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
(C) USA Data&#13;
The USA classifies trade data by the TSUS and TSUSA which relate&#13;
directly to neither the CCCN nor the SITC(R). Using a converter provided by&#13;
the Special Trade Representative's Office, the world trade data were converted&#13;
from SITC(R) to TSUSA 7-digit groups. When one SITC(R) category fed n TSUSA&#13;
category each of the latter was allocated 1/n of the former. The 7-digit data&#13;
were then aggregated to a 5-digit (TSUS) basis comparable to the US trade data&#13;
received from the CATT.&#13;
The whole of this process resulted in around 7% of headings and trade&#13;
being unmatchable. These headings were given the same weight in the adjusted&#13;
(world) trade series as in the national (USA) statistics. The mismatches were&#13;
fairly evenly spread except for a concentration in iron and steel.&#13;
Current research is trying to resolve these difficulties. Overall it&#13;
is likely that our world weighted coverage ratios for the USA are less&#13;
accurate than those for other countries, and that our results for all&#13;
countries' iron and steel sectors are less accurate than those for other&#13;
sectors.&#13;

(b) "The restrictive application of standards"&#13;
(c) At least part of the reason for this figure being below the Balassas' is&#13;
the treatment of voluntary export restrictions on the EEC's vehicle imports&#13;
from Japan. The Balassas include these, but in general we do not, because the&#13;
VERs have never been officially reported by national sources or GATT, and thus&#13;
are excluded from the UNCTAD data. In fact the EEC uses surveillance to&#13;
"implicitly enforce" unofficial (in Britain's case explicitly private) VERs.&#13;
If we include EEC surveillance on vehicles the figure comparable to the&#13;
Balassas' rises to 11.1. Of course the surveillance practices are included in&#13;
column (a) of this table.&#13;

            The extent of nontariff barriers to imports
            of industrial countries

            This paper examines the extent of
            non-tariff barriers to sixteen industrial countries'
            visible imports. Using three alternative measures it shows
            that governmental commodity-specific border-measures affect
            over 27 percent of all imports and over 34 percent of
            imports from developing countries. It also shows that during
            the period 1981-83, NTBs became significantly more
            extensive. Detailed statistics reveal considerable
            variations in NTB coverage by commodity, type of barrier,
            importer and exporter. The data on which these conclusions
            are based are compiled from official information at the
            finest level of disaggregation; they are described in the paper.
