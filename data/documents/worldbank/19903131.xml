&amp;#12;Three Operating Principles of the KGFS Model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Three fundamental operating principles distinguish the KGFS approach:&#13;
&#13;
1.	 Focused geographic commitment and complete population coverage. Each&#13;
    KGFS institution and branch is responsible for a specific catchment area and is&#13;
    expected to serve the entire population in that area, enrolling as many clients&#13;
    as possible.&#13;
&#13;
2.	 Client wealth management approach. KGFS staff recommend a customized set&#13;
    of services for each client based on in-depth household assessments.&#13;
&#13;
3.	 Access to a broad range of products. KGFS works primarily as an agent of&#13;
    banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and pension funds to offer each cli-&#13;
    ent smooth access to a broad range of services.&#13;
&#13;
Implementing each principle involves complex delivery challenges and significantly&#13;
shapes client interactions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      3&#13;

                with distinct geographic, economic, and lin-      and with clients. All signage and documents are in&#13;
          guistic characteristics. As a rule of thumb, a single   the local language, and branches adjust timings for&#13;
          KGFS institution serves a rural population of 2         local convenience. The model is also based on the&#13;
          million to 3 million through a network of 200â&#128;&#147;300       idea that local ties will help the institution react&#13;
          branches. The branch is the fundamental business        more quickly to local events, such as a bad harvest&#13;
          unit. Each branch serves a population of roughly        or low rainfall, for instance, by relaxing repayment&#13;
          10,000 individuals or 2,000 households. Branches        dates or extending emergency loans.&#13;
          have two or three staff, called â&#128;&#156;wealth managers,â&#128;&#157;          In addition, the model reflects the belief that geo-&#13;

     the Money Market Mutual Fund product, which is a close substitute for a basic liquid savings account. Other KGFS institutions do not fall under an NBFC&#13;

pay a fee, it takes about 30 minutes to enroll, and a                stitution started its operations.&#13;

   Branches in existence for more than 30 months                     than five kilometers from the branch, those near-&#13;

phy, let alone remote rural India. KGFS staff talk                   possibly due to not feeling as much need for a local&#13;
about a â&#128;&#156;learning effectâ&#128;&#157; whereby more recently                      service. And households with large landholdings&#13;
established branches that have learned from earlier                  stay out more often, possibly based on their per-&#13;
experiences are seeing even faster enrollment rates.                 ception that KGFS is a brand for less affluent&#13;
Faster enrollment may also be linked to growing fa-                  households.&#13;

            The pursuit of complete financial inclusion
            : the KGFS model in India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Alakudi is a remote farming village near
            the southernmost tip of India in Tamil Nadu State. It would
            take 30 minutes or more by foot to reach the nearest
            dilapidated bank branch, though most Alakudi residents have
            never bothered to make the trip. Within a short bicycle ride
            or walk along dirt lanes, all 2,000 households in Alakudi
            can reach a Kshetriya Gramin Financial Services (KGFS)
            branch. Each branch is painted in KGFS green and orange with
            an open front, rows of wooden benches, a teller window, two
            online computers, and three uniformed staff. But the
            villagers&#146; first contact with KFGS probably would not have
            happened at the branch. When the KGFS branch opened in
            Alakudi in September 2008, staff visited every household to
            conduct a village and household mapping exercise to
            demarcate the service area for the branch. They also invited
            villagers to come to the branch to enroll. As part of
            enrollment, staff completed a comprehensive know your
            customer (KYC) check, including a household visit, and
            compiled a household financial well-being report based on
            data provided by each household. This report established a
            household profile, specified financial goals, and formed the
            basis for KGFS staff to recommend a tailored portfolio of
            two to three financial products to meet each client&#146;s goals.
            KGFS staff visits each client&#146;s home every six months to
            update the report and give financial advice. Since KGFS
            arrived in Alakudi, 76 percent of all households have
            enrolled; of these, 89 percent have already begun to use
            some of the 15 financial products available at the branch.
            The approach used in Alakudi illustrates how the KGFS model
            is being applied in various parts of India. Three core
            operating principles differentiate the KGFS model: (1)
            complete coverage of the population in a focused geographic
            area, (2) customized client wealth management services, and
            (3) abroad range of products.
