RECOMMENDATION OF STATUTORY COMMITTEE&#13;
TO:    The President, International Development Association&#13;
Recommendation of the Committee under Section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement on the proposed Second Power and Gas Sector Development Policy Financing to&#13;
the United Republic of Tanzania&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits its&#13;
recommendation pursuant to said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association grant to the&#13;
United Republic of Tanzania a credit in an amount equivalent to SDR 65,200,000. The said development&#13;
financing operation has three objectives: (i) strengthen the country's ability to bridge the financial gap in&#13;
the power sector; (ii) reduce cost of power supply and promote private sector participation in the power&#13;
sector; and (iii) strengthen the policy and institutional framework for the management of the country's&#13;
natural gas resources.&#13;
1.    The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a credit, and of the&#13;
purpose to which the proceeds of the credit are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which the proceeds of such credit&#13;
are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I of said Articles of&#13;
Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the economic development of the United&#13;
Republic of Tanzania and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of United Republic of&#13;
Tanzania.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said program merits financial assistance from the&#13;
Association, and hereby recommends said program for such assistance.&#13;
