SMALL FARMERS AND THE LANDLESS IN SOUTH ASIA&#13;
The majority of the world's poor are among the 625 million people who&#13;
reside in the rural areas of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The rural poor&#13;
consist predominantly of (i) small owner and tenant cultivators with opera-&#13;
tional holdings of less than 5 acres (2 hectares), and (ii) the landless.&#13;
There are approximately 83 million households with,a population of 410 mil-&#13;
lion in these categories. This paper attempts to examine the prospects for&#13;
improved livelihood for these households and the problems faced by them in&#13;
the three major countries of South Asia.&#13;
Improving the livelihood of small cultivators depends, in the absence&#13;
of anv major programs of land redistribution, upon improving their produc-&#13;
tivity. The availability of abundant family labor and cash scarcity suggests&#13;
an initial concentration on labor-intensive methods to raise small farmer&#13;
productivity through improved cultural practices. Further increases in pro-&#13;
ductivity require multiple cropping, increased use of inputs--water, nutrients,&#13;
pesticides--and the adoption of high-yielding varieties (HYVs). The paper&#13;
examines both the prospects and the problems involved in pursuing these&#13;
strategies.&#13;
For those with little or no land--the landless, near-landless and mar-&#13;
ginal farmers--only increasing employment opportunities in rural areas provide&#13;
any source of hope. There are two sources for such employment growth--on-farm&#13;
demand for wage labor and non-farm employment in ancillary activities such as&#13;
poultry, dairying and livestoc    and in fisheries, forestry, marketing, trans-&#13;
portation and processing services in rural areas. The available evidence&#13;
suggests that both these sources of employment depend upon vigorous agricul-&#13;
tural growth. In its absence increased reliance has to be placed on rural&#13;
works programs to provide employment. Although experience shows that such&#13;
programs had no significant impact on rural employment, a recent experiment--&#13;
the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme in India--provides at least a&#13;
glimmer of hope. In South Asia the sheer magnitude of the task suggests that&#13;
rural works programs will make inroads into the employment problem only if&#13;
accompanied by vigorous agricultural growth.&#13;

SMALL FARMERS AND THE LANDLESS&#13;
IN SOUTH ASIA 1/&#13;
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
I. The Scope of the Problem&#13;
1.   The majority of the world's poor are among the 625 million&#13;
people who reside in the rural areas of Bangladesh, India and&#13;
Pakistan. With between 75 - 90% of their population in rural&#13;
areas, agriculture is the main occupation of between 60 - 70%&#13;
of the total labor force in these countries, and accounts for&#13;
between 40 - 60% of the GDP.&#13;
2.   Although some studies have purported to show that the real&#13;
incomes of the rural poor have been declining absolutely or that&#13;
the proportion of the rural population below an arbitrarily desig-&#13;
nated "poverty line" has been increasing, or both, the evidence&#13;
is sketchy and controversial.   All that can be said with any&#13;
certainty is that the absolute numbers of the rural poor have&#13;
increased in South Asia in the past two decades.&#13;
3.   Due to the limitations of available data it has been necessary&#13;
to transform the definition of "poor" in terms of income into a&#13;
definition based on land cultivated per household. Obviously a&#13;
correct transfQrmation would take account of the quality of land,&#13;
the cropping patterns, irrigation, conditions of tenure and other&#13;
characteristics. However, a cutoff of 5 acres of operated area&#13;
(2 hectares) serves as an acceptable proxy and is used as a working&#13;
definition throughout this paper to identify the rural poor.&#13;
4.   Using this definition the rural poor consist predominantly of&#13;
(i) small owner and tenant cultivators with operational holdings&#13;
of less than 5 acres (2 hectares) and (ii) the landless. The&#13;
estimated numbes of households and population in 1977 in these&#13;
categories are:&#13;

II. Small Farms: Definition and Characteristics&#13;
5.   Despite the extrerme diversity in South Asia it is possible&#13;
to define three broad categories of small cultivators:&#13;
(i) Nedr landless - those with less than one acre (0.4&#13;
hectares) of operated area. The present holdings of this group&#13;
of farmers are too small to provide a subsistence standa-d of&#13;
living even allowing for productivity increases that ait likely&#13;
in the future. These households are akin to the landless in&#13;
their dependence on rural wage incomes as a major source of&#13;
livelihood. They can also supplement their wage incomes through&#13;
a variety of on-farm ancillary activities such as dairying and&#13;
poultry. The near landless account for 31% of the cultivated&#13;
holdings and 3% of the cultivated area in South Asia.&#13;
(ii) Marginal Farmers - those with between 1 and 2.5 ackes&#13;
(0.4 - 1 hectare) of operated area, whose holdings at present&#13;
levels of productivity are too small to provide an adequate&#13;
standard of living but whose per capita incomes could be improved&#13;
substantially by 'future productivitv increases, Nonetheless,&#13;
wage incomes will remain an important supplement to their faxm&#13;
incomes. Farming alone will not provide a decent standard of&#13;
living. Marginal farmers account for 19% of the cultivated&#13;
holdings and 6% of the cultivated area in South Asia.&#13;
(iii) Small Farmers - those with between 2.5 and 5 acres&#13;
(1-2 hectares) of operated area, whose holdings at Present levels&#13;
of productivity provide a standard of living at the bare margin&#13;
of subsistence but where future farm productivity increases could&#13;
definitely provide an adequate standard of living. For these&#13;
farmers farming alone could provide a decent living, but it will&#13;
more likely continue to be supplemented by incomes from other&#13;
sources as they push for higher standards of living. Small farmers&#13;
account for 19% of the cultivated holdings and 12% of the cultivated&#13;
area in South Asia.&#13;
6.   Among the characteristics peculiar to small farmers are&#13;
(i) a high proportion of land devoted to food crops; (ii) a low&#13;
proportion of output marketed (a high proportion retained for&#13;
home consumption); (iii) a more diverse crop portfolio; (iv)&#13;
greater aversion to risk; (v) a greater scarcity of cash and&#13;
capital resources; and (vi) more abundant family labor than&#13;
other larger farms. It is a misconception to view small farmers&#13;
as inefficient, tradition-bound, unresponsive to economic oppor-&#13;
tunities or unwi'.ling to adopt new ideas and technologies or to&#13;
view the small farm sector as unproductive and stagnant. These cha-&#13;
racteristics are important in assessing the appropriate means to&#13;
raise small farmer productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
III. Increasing Small Farmer Productivity: Cropping Practices&#13;
7.    The availability of abundant family labor and the scarcity&#13;
of cash among small farms suggest that initially we must concentrate&#13;
on labor-intensive and cash-saving methods of raising small farmer&#13;
productivity. This is the concept underlying the extension message&#13;
in the Training and Visit System developed by Benor and Harrison.&#13;
Simple management practices beginning with increased plant popula-&#13;
tions and proper plant spacing,followed by the use of good seeds,&#13;
seed treatment, proper tilling, weeding and improved seed bed,&#13;
nursery and land preparation need to be emphasized.&#13;
8.    Considerable success has been achieved with this system and a&#13;
careful analysis of the available evidence suggests that (i) yield&#13;
increases in the range of 10 - 30% on rainfed land and 25 - 50% on&#13;
irrigated land can be obtained without any increase in any other&#13;
inputs apart from labor and the knowledqe of these practices;&#13;
(ii) most ot these practices are adoptea very rapiduy (2 - 3 years)&#13;
once they are introduced, and (iii) that there are no significant&#13;
differences between farms of different sizes in the rates of&#13;
adoption, the number of practices adopted, or the yield increases&#13;
achieved. All farmers, includinq small farmers, can benefit from&#13;
the introduction of such simple practices.&#13;
9.    Althouigh these promising results are based on very recent and&#13;
limited evidence and experience from a few Indian states (Rajasthan,&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam) and suqqest appropriate&#13;
caution, it is encouraging that these states are among those whose&#13;
past agricu:Ltural performance has been poor and which have a large&#13;
number of small cultivated holdings.&#13;
10.   The ability to replicate these practices over large areas&#13;
quickly will depend upon how extensive the coverage is of the exist-&#13;
ing extension systems, how quickly these can be reorganized, and&#13;
also on the existing accumulation of region-specific research and&#13;
extension. In this regard it may be easier to extend these practices&#13;
and realize their benefits more quickly in India than in Bangladesh&#13;
and Pakistan where research and extension infrastructures arrf less&#13;
developed.&#13;
11.   Further yield increases can be obtained by making fuller use&#13;
of the little land available to small farmers, through multiple&#13;
cropping. T'here is a need to change the emphasis from increasing&#13;
yields per unit area to increasing yields per unit area per unit time.&#13;
This requires the use of land to grow two or even three crops per&#13;
year, with somewhat less than proportional, but still substantial,&#13;
increases in small farmer incomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
12.   Although in aggregate the intensity of land use in South Asia&#13;
seems low (only 10 - 15% of the land under multiple cropping in India&#13;
and Pakistan and 40% in Bangladesh compared to nearly 90% in Republic&#13;
of China, cropping intensities are inversely related to farm size.&#13;
The area multiple-cropped on farms smaller than rive acres ranges&#13;
from 16 - 27% in India and 30 - 50% in Pakistan, while in Bangladesh&#13;
it is nearly 60 - 80%--as high as in Republic of China. In India&#13;
and Pakistan we are talking about the need to get two crops per&#13;
year on a larger percentage of the area, while in Bangladesh on&#13;
the other hand we are talking about getting three crops a year,&#13;
on a larger percentage of the area and on small farms.&#13;
13.   Doubling the cropping intensity would virtually double faxm&#13;
incomes as well as farm employment on all farms, with significant&#13;
benefits for the landless and smallholders who seek seasonal&#13;
employment on larger holdings.&#13;
14.   Although increased multiple cropping will be beneficial tc)&#13;
all farmers as well as the landless, significantly higher croppinnq&#13;
intensities will not be easy to achieve quickly. This is because&#13;
increased multiple cropping involves the careful and scientific&#13;
management of complex croppinq systems in which the timely performance&#13;
of agricultural operations, tied to the quicker maturity of crops,&#13;
will have to be complemented by the development of extensive and&#13;
efficient marketing systems and distribution networks to assure&#13;
timely access to relevant inputs and services to all, but particularly&#13;
small farmers.&#13;
15.   In their order of importance the most necessary (but not&#13;
sufficient) conditions for increased multiple cropping on small&#13;
farms are: (i) increased irrigation and better water control;&#13;
(ii) improved quick-maturing crop varieties; (iii) improved crop&#13;
management; (iv) increased nutrient use; (v) better insect and&#13;
disease control; and (vi) more efficient post-harvest technologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. Increasing Small Farmer Productivity: Input-Intensive Strategies&#13;
16.   Further productivity increases-- beyond those obtained by changing&#13;
simple cropping practices--require additional phvsical inputs such as&#13;
(i) new seeds; (ii) nutrients and pesticides;(i'i) irrigation, as well&#13;
as institut:Lonal inputs such as (iv) credit; (v) marketing infrastruc-&#13;
ture; (vi) research and extension to disseminate knowledge and (vii)&#13;
management skills.&#13;
17.   There is considerable evidence that small farmers have adopted&#13;
the "green-revolution" technologies--high yielding varieties (HYV)&#13;
and nutrient use--extensively and have benefitted considerably as&#13;
a result. Although HYVs have been limited mainly to irrigated&#13;
areas, and HYV wheat has been adopted much more extensively than&#13;
HYV rice (which has required more location-specific adaptation),&#13;
small farmers in recent years have matched the performance of large&#13;
farmers, in terms of (i) percentage of farmers using HYVs, (ii)&#13;
percentage of sown area under HYVs, and (iii) intensity of nutrient&#13;
use per hectare.at least in India and Banqladesh. In Pakistan they&#13;
have generally lagged behind larger farmers but more recently--&#13;
since 1974--they have started to adopt these technologies more rapidly.&#13;
18.   In spite of this rapid adoption small farmers have not realized&#13;
all their potential gains from increased use of HYVs and nutrients.&#13;
Additional per hectare yield increases of between 20 - 120% are&#13;
possible under irrigated conditions depending upon the crop and&#13;
variety sowna. These represent increases in net incomes of a similar&#13;
order for small farmers. Under unirrigated conditions the potentials&#13;
for additional yield increases are extremely low except for a few&#13;
selected crops. Thus increased irrigation is central to realizing&#13;
large productivity increases on small farms.&#13;
19.   The extent to which these potential yield and income increases&#13;
will be realized on small farms will depend upon (i) small farmer&#13;
access to the necessary inputs, especially irrigation, (ii) the&#13;
agrarian structure and conditions of tenancy, and (iii) small&#13;
farmer control and participation in local institutions.&#13;
20.   Increased irrigaion is central.   Although considerable addi-&#13;
tional potential for surface and groundwater irrigation exists and&#13;
is being exploited in South Asia, several institutional and economic&#13;
problems that hamper the ability of small farmers in obtaining their&#13;
share of this essential resource will have to be overcome. For sur-&#13;
face irrigation these include (i) the lack of investable funds to&#13;
build on-farm channels; water courses and drainage systems; (ii) lack&#13;
of access and control over canal water flows to assure timely irriga-&#13;
tion; (iii) lack of access to credit to finance irrigation works,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-vi -&#13;
and, among tenants, lack of secure and clear titles to land, which&#13;
provides the main collateral for medium-term loans;and (iv) ineffi-&#13;
cient and at times even excessive use of surface irrigation in the&#13;
fields. For qroundwater irriqation (wells and tubewells) these&#13;
problems include (i) the lack of investable funds and medium-term&#13;
credits; (ii) economies of scale in tubewell irrigation that miLli-&#13;
tate against private ownership on small holdings; (iii) lack of&#13;
control over public wells and tubewells;and (iv) most criticalLy,&#13;
the fragmentation of holdings which prevents any rational or effi-&#13;
cient use of groundwater irrigation systems.   At best one :an hope&#13;
that small farmers, who irrigate a larger proportion of their&#13;
cultivated area, wi.ll get their proportional share--that is the&#13;
share of irrigated area that they now command--of the additional&#13;
irrigation potential currently being exploited in South Asia.&#13;
Without irrigation they will be permanently cut off from the&#13;
benefits of new technologies.&#13;
21.   The potential for additional irriqation is very large, at&#13;
least in Bangladesh and India. (In Pakistan nearly 3/4 of the&#13;
area is already irrigated and the potential here is not at the&#13;
extensive margin but rather at the intensive margin--that is in&#13;
using water and conveying it effectively through canals to the&#13;
farmers' fields). But irrigation is plagued in all three coun-&#13;
tries by the severe fraqmentation of holdinqs and the associated&#13;
problems of riparian rights tnat have led to an under-exploittation&#13;
of their enormous irrigation potentials. Little progress has been&#13;
made in solving these critical problems that affect all farmers.&#13;
22.   In addition, building up the necessary institutional framework,&#13;
economic viability and administrative capacity to install and exploit&#13;
complex surface command area and groundwater irrigation systems and&#13;
then assure small farmers' access to them poses the main challenge&#13;
in South Asian agriculture.&#13;
23.   The scope for increasing productivity differs little bet.wo'&#13;
small farms and other farms, except pernaps in Paxistan where the&#13;
former account for only 5 percent of the cultivated area, An aqqre-&#13;
gate 3.5 - 4% per annum qrowth in agricultural production for Bang-&#13;
ladesh and India seems quite feasible. Pakistan has achieved rates&#13;
of growth in agricultural production in excess of 4.0% during the&#13;
past decade and a half, but with some signs of decelerationa in&#13;
recent years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-vii -&#13;
V.  Inst:Ltutional Constraints:  Problems of Access&#13;
to Factor and Product Markets&#13;
Credit&#13;
24.   Although lack of credit is often cited as a major constraint,&#13;
it is ne:ither necessary nor sufficient for increased productivity&#13;
on small farms.   The central need is for technologies that offer&#13;
reliable and well proven yield increases to persuade risk-averse&#13;
small farmers to depart from traditional practices. Where these&#13;
are unavailable credit will not suffice; where they are, credit&#13;
remains at best an enabling condition, and becomes more readily&#13;
available.&#13;
25.   Small farmers pay more for the credit they get because they&#13;
rely more heavily on non-institutional sources,which charge higher&#13;
interest rates but also offer more flexibility and bear higher&#13;
associated risks. Attempts to replace these sources with institu-&#13;
tional credits without offering equivalent flexibility, terms and&#13;
risk acceptability are unlikely to succeed.&#13;
26.   Subsidized interest rates for small farmers, apart from being&#13;
administratively infeasible, create problems of inefficient use of&#13;
capital and artificial credit scarcity from which small farmers&#13;
seldom benefit. Subsidies for small farmers can be justified on&#13;
several crounds but it is a mistake to use the credit mechanism as&#13;
a vehicle for such subsidies.&#13;
27.   Small farmer credit problems are probably more severe in&#13;
Pakistan than in Bangladesh and India. This is partly due to the&#13;
neglect of credit. institutions generally and partly due to the&#13;
slower growth of credit cooperatives, especially those geared to&#13;
small farmer needs. The more rapid adoption of new technologies&#13;
by small farmers in recent years will tend to make credit institu-&#13;
tions more able and willing to serve small farmer needs, as they&#13;
have in India and Bangladesh.&#13;
28.   The greatest need small farmers have is not for short-term&#13;
production credits, which non-institutional sources readily provide,&#13;
but for medium-term credits to finance equipment (tubewells) and&#13;
farm improvements.. Both the size and terms of such loans preclude&#13;
the traditional sources from providing these credits. This is an&#13;
area where new credit institutions can play a positive role by&#13;
increasing the volume of medium-term credits (without necessarily&#13;
subsidizing interest rates) to small farmers. The problem will be&#13;
one of Droper collateral. As land is the most common form of colla-&#13;
teral, srnall farmers--and especially tenants, whose rights are&#13;
neither acknowledged nor secure--have systematically been denied&#13;
access to medium- and long-term credits. The alternative is to use&#13;
crop outputs as collateral and provide crop loans, but these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- viii -&#13;
require the proper recordina of crop and input-cost shares and&#13;
present problems of a different nature. Nonetheless innovative&#13;
methods and new institutions are needed to attack these medium-&#13;
and long-term credit problems if small and tenant farmers are to&#13;
benefit increasingly from technological innovations.&#13;
29.   Although credit cooperatives have been more receptive to&#13;
small farmers' needs, and offer one alternative, their impact has&#13;
been limited because small farmers have been unable to control them&#13;
through participation at the decision-making level. They also&#13;
suffer from poor management and financi,al instability, and have&#13;
not been able to keep up with the rapid increase in the demand for&#13;
credit in the wake of the cash-intensive "green-revolution"&#13;
technologies.&#13;
Markets&#13;
30.   Small farmers are not isolated but well inteqrated into local&#13;
markets In South Asia. Although several marketing problems exist--&#13;
inadequate trans2ort, storage facilities, poor dissemination of&#13;
information, lack of standards, large numbers of intermediaries,&#13;
inadequate finance for trading--these problems are not peculiar to&#13;
small farmers. Nor are traditional and local markets in which small&#13;
farmers participate necessarily inefficient or exploitative, as is&#13;
often maintained.&#13;
31.   Government regulation of markets has invariably led to illicit&#13;
trade, increased intermediation and marketing costs that have not&#13;
been beneficial to small farmers,&#13;
32.   Special c9nditions that aggravate marketing problems for small&#13;
farmers include (i) the necessity--imposed by the need to meet cash&#13;
and debt obligations--to sell cheap at post-harvest prices and buy&#13;
back dear at pre-harvest prices; (ii) small farmers' smaller leverage&#13;
in negotiating favorable terms because of the small volume of their&#13;
output marketed;and (iii) the higher cost credit they obtain to tide&#13;
them from pre- to post-harvest periods.&#13;
330   These-problems can only   partly  be   resolved through marketing&#13;
cooperatives which suffer from problems similar to credit cooperatives='&#13;
poor management, financial instability and subversion by powerful&#13;
(usually large farmer) interests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
Extension, Research and Education&#13;
34.   Public institutions set up to provide these services       have&#13;
denied small farmers access and      have failed to deliver knowledge&#13;
that is appropriate to small farmer needs. They need to be tho-&#13;
roughly reorganized and experiments with new organizational forms&#13;
are needed to assure that the services these institutions provide&#13;
become more available and relevant to small farmers.&#13;
35.   Educated small farmers are the key element.    A failure to&#13;
achieve near universal rates of rural literacy will continue to be&#13;
an important hindrance to the ability of rural people, especially&#13;
small farmers, to adopt and manage new technologies effectively&#13;
and to control rural institutions, supposedly designed for their&#13;
benefit but subverted by the more literate rural elites.&#13;
36.   Agricultural research needs to focus on:   (i) new high yielding&#13;
varieties for arid crops and arid agricultural systems; (ii) the&#13;
development and breeding of livestock; (iii) nutrient and water use&#13;
efficiency in multiple cropping systems;and (iv) cropping systems&#13;
and practices suitable for the cash-scarce and labor-abundant con-&#13;
ditions of the small farmer.&#13;
37.   In India agricultural research and extension are well developed&#13;
and can be rapidly adapted to focus on these problems. In Bangladesh,&#13;
although the extension systems are well developed and could be quickly&#13;
reorganized, the basic research institutions are not sufficiently&#13;
developed to devise the complex multiple cropping systems needed by&#13;
most farmers. Developing these research institutions is crucial.&#13;
In Pakistan both the research and extension systems are relatively&#13;
under-developed and will need considerable investment to bring them&#13;
to a level consistent with Pakistan's future needs. A different&#13;
focus of research in Pakistan will have to be on the efficiency of&#13;
water use in a complex multi-crop environment and the efficiency of&#13;
water conveyance to farmers' fields.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. Non-Farm Employment and the Landless&#13;
38.   Non-farm and non-crop activities will continue to be a primary&#13;
source of employment and earnings for the landless, near-lanaiess&#13;
and marginal farmers. Activities such as raising poultry and live-&#13;
stock, especially small stock and dairying, are important sources&#13;
of income. Irn particular, dairy projects under a variety of coope-&#13;
rative ventures hlave been highly successful and have provided sub-&#13;
stantial income gains to large numbers of landless, marginals and&#13;
small farmers.   These ventures are now being tried in ne.zly 10 of&#13;
the 14 Indian states and in Pakistan.&#13;
39.   The number of landless families in South Asia is not known with&#13;
any certainty. Our best estimates suggest that there may be more&#13;
than 30 million landless households in South Asia.    These households&#13;
nave to rely primarily on the growth of wage employment in the rural&#13;
sector.&#13;
40.   There are two sources for such employment growth:   on-farm&#13;
demand for wage labor, and non-farm employment in processing, fisheries,&#13;
forestry, marketing, transportation, distribution and services in&#13;
rural areas. The growth of both these sources of employment depends&#13;
upon and is highly correlated with the rate of growth of agricultural&#13;
output.&#13;
41.   The available evidence suggests that unless agricultural growth&#13;
exceeds 3 - 4% per annum and that unless this rate is sustained for&#13;
at least a decade, the additional wage employment generated will&#13;
remain small and is not likely to contribute much to the solution&#13;
of rural unemployment. The percentages of the rural population&#13;
unemployed or underemployed are already very large and the rural&#13;
labor force is growing at rates in excess of 2% per annum. So a&#13;
hiqh and sustained rate of agricultural qrowth is both a necessary&#13;
and a sufficient condition for high rates of qrowth of non-farm&#13;
employment opportunities. Rural unemployment in South Asia will&#13;
never be solved if agriculture is stagnant.&#13;
42.   Although rural work proqrams serve a useful purpose in relieving&#13;
disasters, they have generally had no significant impact on rural&#13;
employment. In South Asia the sheer maqnitude of the task will&#13;
continue to defeat their purpose, if this purpose is to mate subs-&#13;
tantial inroads into rural unemployment. For this we will have to&#13;
look to vigorous agricultural growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xi -&#13;
43.   Finally there are the questions of land reform and tenancY&#13;
reform. Regarding land reforms the considered opinion is that the&#13;
opportunity for radical reformist action has already past in South Asia.&#13;
44.   Small tenant holdings (holdings of less than five acres that&#13;
are wholly or partly rented) account for a large share of all holdings&#13;
and total cultivated area especially in India and Bangladesh.&#13;

Pakistan             11                     2&#13;
45.    Regarding tenancy there are two issues: (i) to what extent&#13;
will productivity increases on tenant farms accrue as incomes to&#13;
small tenants; and (ii) what tenancy reforms would improve their lot?&#13;
As to the first question, at present we do not know how much of the&#13;
potential productivity increases, if realized, will accrue to tenants.&#13;
In any given case this will depend on such factors as the length of&#13;
tenure, the landlards' and tenants' rental shares of output, the&#13;
amount of land rented, the arrangements regarding the sharing of&#13;
input costs, the cropping pattern and the technologies used--factors&#13;
that cannot be easily generalized. Further, tenancy contracts have&#13;
been changing in recent years as technological innovations have&#13;
spread, making assumptions about rental shares more difficult.&#13;
Rental shares are about 50 percent at present so that as a rough&#13;
estimate at least half the productivity increases would accrue to&#13;
small tenants. But this is only a guess and additional work is&#13;
needed before we can resolve this issue.&#13;
46.   Regarding tenancy refoim the best suggestions are to (i'&#13;
reduce the rental shares tenants have to pay, (ii) encourage&#13;
input-cost sharing, and (iii) confer security of tenure. A rough&#13;
estimate is that a reduction of the rental share to a maximum of&#13;
25 percent could raise tenant incomes by more than half. This&#13;
would require the recording of all leases and the enforcement -f the&#13;
maximum rental shares. Both present serious administrative and poli-&#13;
tical problems as does the conferring of security.    Input-cos: sharing&#13;
may be the only alternative remaining, and th,ere is evidence that this&#13;
is already being undertakern.  Finally, whatet\wer tenancy reforms are&#13;
enacted are unlikely to solve the problems of the Landless, wL- will&#13;
have to continue to rely on wage emplo7ment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xii -&#13;
47.     The experience with rural work programs as a means for&#13;
providing employment in South Asia has been mixed.       although&#13;
they serve a very useful purpose in the relief of r-udden disasters,&#13;
the salient fact is that they have had only an insignificant impact&#13;
on the magnitude of the rural unemployment problem, except in very&#13;
few cases and in a limited regional context.      In South Asia,&#13;
whatever the organizational, productivity, implementation and fiscal&#13;
problems associated with the development of rural work programs,&#13;
the sheer maqniti'de of the task will continue to defeat their&#13;
purpose, if this purpose is to make substantial inroads into rural&#13;
unemployment. For this we will have to look to vigorous agrl-&#13;
cultural growth. A stagnant agriculture will continue to assure&#13;
an increasing and insurmountable rural unemployment problem for&#13;
decades to come in South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter I: INTRODUCTION: THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM&#13;
The majority of the world's poor reside in rural South Asia. 1/&#13;
The rural poor are predominantly small farmers-- some of whom own&#13;
land, but most of whom are tenants--with cultivated holdings of less&#13;
than 5 acres (2 hectares), and the landless.    Any programs aimed at&#13;
either the eradication of rural poverty or the acceleration of growth&#13;
in the agricultural sector have to increase the productivity of the&#13;
former an.l the employment opportunities for the latter.&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which&#13;
(i) small farmer productivity increases are possible, (ii) institu-&#13;
tional and other constraints prevent such increases and (iii) employ-&#13;
ment and income opportunities can be found for the landless in South&#13;
Asia. In particular we want to find out whether significant increases&#13;
in small farmer productivity are feasible and what separate or inte-&#13;
grated measures have been tried, where and with what success. Further,&#13;
we want to assess in general terms what, if any, have been the insti-&#13;
tutional constraints that have prevented small farmers from realizing&#13;
their productive potential. Finally we want to assess what, if any-&#13;
thing, can be done to relieve the conditions of poverty in which many&#13;
small tenants and the landless survive in the sub-continent.&#13;
The subject matter is vast and the conditions bearing on these&#13;
problems are complex and diverse. A treatment of these issues in-&#13;
evitably involves not only a detailed examination of the microeconomic&#13;
evidence at the farm level--in conditions of enormous agronomic, cli-&#13;
matic, institutional and economic diversity--but also an understanding&#13;
of the aggregate structure of the rural economies and the social,&#13;
cultural and political relationships in which individual decisions&#13;
to obtain a better standard of living are embedded. Obviously, not&#13;
all these issues can be dealt with in a single paper; the main focus&#13;
of the present study is on the potential for increases in the pro-&#13;
ductivity of small farms, and on the income gains that would result.&#13;
The problems of massive rural unemployment in South Asia and&#13;
the conditions of the landless are treated less fully, not because&#13;
they are unimportant but because to a large extent any lasting&#13;
solution would inevitably e-tail either massive institutional&#13;
changes (land reform) of a type unlikely to take place given present&#13;
political realities, or in their absence, vigorous and sustained&#13;
growth in agricultural productivity and output in which small farmers&#13;
would participate fully.&#13;
1/ South Asia throughout the paper is used to denote the three&#13;
largest countries of the sub-continent - Bangladesh, India and&#13;
Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The paper is organized as follows: the remainder of this&#13;
Chapter describes the broad magnitudes of the problem in terms of&#13;
numbers of small farm, tenant and landless households in South Asia;&#13;
Chapter 2 characterizes the "small farm" in terms of the size of the&#13;
family holding and other economic characteristics; Chapter 3 examines&#13;
the extent to which small farmer productivity can be increased by&#13;
changes in simple cropping practices, and the adoption of scientific&#13;
multiple cropping systems without an increase in any inputs otler&#13;
than the amount of family labor and the quality of farm management.&#13;
Chapter 4 then examines what additional productivity incrc -es can&#13;
be obtained through increased nutrient use and the adoption of new&#13;
HYVs on small farms under unirrigated and irrigated conditions for&#13;
the main foodgrain crops, which account for between 85 - 90% o:E small&#13;
farm cropped areas. It also reviews briefly the large irrigation&#13;
potential in South Asia and the problems small farmers may encounter&#13;
in obtaining their fair share from its anticipated exploitation.&#13;
Chapter 5 examines the institutional problems associated witti small&#13;
farmers' access to credit, markets, extension, research and education--&#13;
all seen as essential to increasing their productivity; finally Chapter&#13;
6 examines the magnitude of non-farm employment in rural areas and&#13;
the potentials for increasing the incomes of small farmers and the&#13;
landless through these activities.&#13;
South Asia has an estimated population of some 783 million, of&#13;
whom some 625 million reside in rural areas0 With between 75% and&#13;
90% of their total populations in rural areas and with agriculture&#13;
the main occupation of between 60% and 70% of the total labor force&#13;
in these countries, the majority of the poor also reside in rural&#13;
areas. (Some basic economic characteristics of these economies are&#13;
given in Table l. 1o)&#13;
Although some studies have put forward the view that the&#13;
incomes of the rural poor in South Asia have been falling absoLutely&#13;
or that the proportion of the rural population below a so-called and&#13;
often arbitrarily designated "poverty line" has been increasing,&#13;
or both, the evidence is sketchy and highly controversial. AlL&#13;
that can be said with any certainty is that the absolute numbers&#13;
of the rural poor have increased everywhere. I/&#13;
The rural. poor consist predominantly of agricultural labor&#13;
households (mainly the landless and some who cultivate very small&#13;
plots of land) and small land holders (including some who own itheir&#13;
land, but predominantly tenants) with cultivated holdings of less&#13;
than five acres (about 2 hectares) and particularly less than 2.5&#13;
acres (1 hectare). 2/&#13;
1/ The available evidence is presented in Annex I, but a grealt deal&#13;
of credence cannot be attached to it.&#13;
2/ Minhas (1974) for example states that in India between 75% - 85%&#13;
of all households with less than five acres of operational holdings&#13;
lay below a "poverty line" he calculated for 1960-6l1 Dandekar and&#13;
Rath (1971) reached similar conclusions0&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The breakdown of the rural population in South Asia by broad&#13;
classes is given in Table 12.&#13;
These figures reveal substantial differences in the agrarian&#13;
structure and hence in the probable "poverty profiles' of the coun-&#13;
tries in the sub-continent-&#13;
- Although in India and Bangladesh a large proportion of all&#13;
rural households (90% and 70% respectively) are cultivating house-&#13;
holds, in Pakistan the proportion is only 45%;&#13;
- A very high proportion of all cultivated holdings in India&#13;
and Bangladesh (70% and 83% respectively) are small, with less than&#13;
five acres of operated area; in Pakistan this category accounts for&#13;
only 28% of all holdings;&#13;
- Although a high proportion of all cultivated holdings in&#13;
Pakistan (58%) and Bangladesh (34%) are either partly or wholly&#13;
cultivated under some form of tenancy relationship, a much lower&#13;
percentage, only 24%, of all cultivated holdings in India are so&#13;
operated. 1/&#13;
- The available evidence (fragmentary and perhaps unreliable)&#13;
suggests that of the non-cultivating rural households, a large&#13;
proportion in India and Bangladesh are landless and probably earn&#13;
their livelihood through part or full time employment in agriculture,&#13;
while in Pakistan landless households are probably a far smaller pro-&#13;
portion of the total -rural households. 2/&#13;
It is evident that any program of poverty eradication in South&#13;
Asia has to concern itself with the smallholders (tenant and non-&#13;
tenant) and the landless in rural areas. Our estimates of the&#13;
magnitude of the problem by 1977 are shown in Table 13.&#13;
Agricultural census data for South Asia are notoriously&#13;
unreliable. Alternative data sources that allow us to cross-check&#13;
the reliability of census data exist only for India. While the NSS&#13;
gives a figure of 24t of all Indian cultivating households in some&#13;
form of tenancy the census gives an unreliable figure of 9%.    Simi-&#13;
larly, while the All India Debt and Investment Survey (1972-73) shows&#13;
only 72% of all rural households as cultivating households, the census&#13;
gives an unreliably high figure of 90%. We use tne latter to correct&#13;
our estimates and give these figures in parentheses0 We feel the&#13;
latter figures more 'reliable' to the extent that the word 'reliable'&#13;
X/ The 19eYl agricultural census data give much lower figures - 4% partly&#13;
owned and rented and 5% wholly rented0 But these figures are obviousl&#13;
in error because the agrarian conditions have not changed that dras-&#13;
tically in the intervening decade0 The more reliable NSS figures for&#13;
for 1961-62 are used hare and in Table 1020&#13;
2/ Extreme caution has to be advised in using this conclusion as it is&#13;
an estimate from one s:udy. Probably no one knows the real extent&#13;
of landlessness in Pakistan0&#13;

can be used in this context. 1/ At best only the broad magnitudes&#13;
are important in such an exerclse.&#13;
Using these figures we calculate that with rural populations of&#13;
nearly 625 million, there are an estimated 110.8 million rural house-&#13;
holds (average household size in 5.6) in South Asia. Of these, nearly&#13;
75.1 million are cultivating households. Of the cultivating house-&#13;
holds some 51.5 million operate less than five acres, and probably&#13;
support a total population of some 253 million. Nearly 15.5 million&#13;
of all cultivating households operate either wholly or partly under&#13;
some form of tenant-landlord relationship and support some 80 million&#13;
people,but have to share the fruits of their labors with landlords.&#13;
Finally, an estimated 30.9 million households may be totally land-&#13;
less and support a population of some 157 million people by their wage&#13;
labor alone in environments where unemployment and underemployment&#13;
are widespread.&#13;
1/ The estimates of landlessness in Pakistan are probably the most&#13;
unreliable of these estimates. Further,what can one make of only&#13;
45% of its rural households in cultivation? What are the other 55%&#13;
doing and how do we reconcile this with the low percentage of&#13;
landless population? The questions can be asked but not easily&#13;
answered.&#13;

Chapter II:  SMALL FARMERS AND SMALL FARM CHARACTERISTICS&#13;
While the major emphasis of agricultural strategies in the sub-&#13;
continent must be on increasing food production, it should be&#13;
explicitly recognized that small farmers have an important role in&#13;
expanding production, and that increased production by these farmers=-&#13;
a larqe segment of the rural poor--can assist significantly in an&#13;
attack on poverty.&#13;
A strategy to reduce poverty aimed specifically at small farmers&#13;
is especially important because:&#13;
-  the majority of the small farmers are among the abject poor&#13;
in rural areas;&#13;
- individuals in this group have access to land (although their&#13;
farms are small) and they are engaged in production activities&#13;
that provide gainful employment at least most of the year;&#13;
- among all small producers a high percentage of the land is&#13;
often used for food crops. As one of the most direct and&#13;
visible consequences of poverty is malnutrition, any measures&#13;
designed to increase productivity, especially of food crop&#13;
cultivation on small farms, are likely to have a major and&#13;
direct impact on nutrition. (The marginal propensity to con-&#13;
sume food out of production is in the range of .75 to 09 in&#13;
most cases.)&#13;
But what is a small farmer, how can he be identified and how many&#13;
small farmers are there in South Asia?&#13;
A0 Concept of the Small Farmer&#13;
Usually a small farmer is taken to be synonymous with a poor&#13;
farmer, 1/ but farm size alone is an inadequate criterion for dis-&#13;
tinguishing poor farmers from those better off. Net per capita&#13;
income is the only true measure for this. However, to estimate&#13;
it requires very detailed and frequently unobtainable data on the&#13;
types of crops grown, the types of inputs used, the crop yields, the&#13;
costs of cultivation, the money value of gross output and, of course,&#13;
off-farm incomes earned and the size of the household. Alternative&#13;
1/ While a relatively high proportion of small landholding households&#13;
are poor, not all "poor" households are drawn from this category,&#13;
nor are all small holders poor0 Thus, Vaidyanathan (1974) shows&#13;
in India households with less than one acre accounted for no more&#13;
than 20% of all households with per capita consumption of less than&#13;
Rs. 10 per month in 1951-57. Roughly a fifth of all households with&#13;
less than an acre had per capita monthly consumption exceeding Rs. 1l&#13;
at 1960-61 prices,which was defined as the "poverty line" in his&#13;
study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
measures, such as gross farm income or the proportion of off-farm&#13;
to total incomie earned, present similar problems. Even if such&#13;
measures of income were available, where the cut-off line should&#13;
be drawn to identify small farmers is always an arbitrary decision.&#13;
At any rate, no adequate data exist to allow us to map farm incomes&#13;
of any type into numbers of small farm holdings in South Asia at an&#13;
aggregate level. 1/&#13;
Data limitations make a definition based on area operated diffi-&#13;
cult to avoid, despite the extreme regional diversity of production&#13;
systems in South Asia, with respect to rainfall, soil fertility,&#13;
irrigation and other factors affecting land quality and intensity&#13;
of input use. Even these statistics are not always reliable and data&#13;
from different sources are sometimes inconsistent. However, the size&#13;
of operated holding provides a first and only available cut at the&#13;
problem, at an aggregate level.&#13;
1/ The Indian Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC),&#13;
one of the main recipients of IDA funds for agricultural development,&#13;
classifies small farmers as those with pre-project family income&#13;
in 1972 prices of less than Rs 2,000 (US$235) per annum. This is&#13;
equivalent to a per capita income of about US$70 per annum at today's&#13;
prices. ARDC has translated this "pre-project income" into an area&#13;
equivalent for every district in India. Where ecological variations&#13;
are significant within a district, ARDC has broken the district into&#13;
smaller units. Applying their definition, a small farmer may be one&#13;
with a farm of 3.5 ac. in better rainfall areas, or over 40 ac. in&#13;
the more arid parts of India. This range of farms with the same pre-&#13;
project income illsutrates the dangers of using a single area-based&#13;
figure as the criterion to define a small farmer.&#13;
However, using "pre-project income" to define a small farmer is not&#13;
without its drawbacks. For example, applying the ARDC definition,&#13;
a farmer with 4 ac. unirrigated land but with reliable rainfall&#13;
(say, in Kerala) may fall outside the small farmer definition,&#13;
while a farmer with 10 ac. on the Deccan Plateau, where raInfall is&#13;
unreliable, may classify as a small farmer. It may well be true&#13;
that the 10 ac. farmer is worse off than his 4 ac. counterpart,&#13;
but this says nothing about potential. It is likely that the&#13;
potential of the farmer on the Deccan Plateau with irrigation&#13;
exceeds that of the Kerala farmer on a per ha basis. Thus, by&#13;
directing resources, say irrigation, at the "smaller farmer" as&#13;
defined by pre-project income (the 10 ac. farmer on the Deccan&#13;
Plateau) one creates a very large and profitable farmer, worsening&#13;
income distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
In order not to be totally arbitrary, we use the concept of a&#13;
family ho1ding, defined as "a holding that would yield adequate&#13;
income to maintain average farm family at a nutritionally desirable&#13;
level of living." U   We have calculated this in terms of the land&#13;
needed for family subsistence by computing the calories requ:ired by&#13;
an average family per year and dividing that by the average rice or&#13;
wheat yields over the past five and ten years for Pakistan, 13angla-&#13;
desh and the different states in India. The results are shown in&#13;
Table 2.1. They indicate quite clearly that in India, whether in&#13;
the rice or the wheat zone, about 2 to 2.5 acres of land a     required&#13;
to maintain an average family in subsistence. 2/ These requirements&#13;
of course vary from one state to another, from a low of 1.2 to 1.3&#13;
acres in Punjab and Tamil Nadu, to nearly 3.5-4 acres in a4adhya&#13;
Pradesh and Nagaland depending upon the average yields in these&#13;
states. A similar exercise for Pakistan and Bangladesh yields&#13;
land requirements of approximately 2.5 - 3 acres per family..&#13;
These estimates define absolute minimum subsistence requirements,&#13;
and since they are based on average yields, they do not account for&#13;
yield variations, which can be substantial from year to year in the&#13;
sub-continent. To assure the family of survival, say at least 9 out&#13;
of every 10 years, would require at least twice as much land as de-&#13;
fined by this absolute minimum. 3/ Of course, there are offsetting&#13;
factors: intensity of cultivation, off-farm incomes, better manage-&#13;
ment, higher input use, make it possible to meet this minimum from&#13;
much smaller holdings. On the other hand, the existence of tenure&#13;
and share holding arrangements and low productive semi-arid and&#13;
rainfed areas make it necessary to have much larger holdings on&#13;
the average.&#13;
For the purpose of this paper we define three broad size categories.&#13;
First, what one might readily call marginal farmers, with less than 2.5&#13;
acres, who live very close to the margin of subsistence, especially&#13;
if they rely only on farm incomes. Second, small farmers, wi-th 2.5 - 5&#13;
acres per family. 4/ Third, families with less than I acre of operated&#13;
holding.  These might be called the near-landless, since their pro-&#13;
ductive potential is too small to meet even their subsistence needs.&#13;
They would have to supplement their incomes through off-farm employment&#13;
and would have to depend continuously on wage incomes.&#13;

Field Study, Reserve Bank of India Bombay, October, 1974.&#13;
2/  This figure has often been used to define small farms in South&#13;
Asia. The Indian Small Farmer Development Agency (SFDA) uses a&#13;
blanket definition of 5 ac. non-irrigated or 2-1/2 ac. irrigated&#13;
to identify a small farmer for subsidy purposes but, as the ARDC&#13;
pre-project definition indicates, such a definition is iriappro-&#13;
priate when ecological factors are taken into account. T'hough&#13;
easier t.o administer a blanket definition, in practice large&#13;
farmers have dominated the SFDA program.&#13;

We have so far considered some of the problems of using a single&#13;
absolute definition of small farmers. The term "small" farmer has a&#13;
relative as well as an absolute connotation. For example, as&#13;
Table   2.3     shows, if 2.5 acres were the cut-off point, then only&#13;
14% of farms in Pakistan would be classified as "small", against over&#13;
50% of the Indian and Bangladesh farms. But in Pakistan, where the&#13;
average farm sizes about 11 acres, it possibly makes sense to talk&#13;
about an 8 acre farmer as a small farmer, while his counterpart in&#13;
India would be a larger farmer. Because of the difficulties of reach-&#13;
ing a satisfactory definition of a small farmer that allows for easy&#13;
aggregation of numbers of small farmers, either within a country or&#13;
between countries, we have used the term loosely throughout this paper.&#13;
According to these definitions then, nearly 70% of the holdings&#13;
in India can be classified as small, marginal or near-landless. These&#13;
account for nearly 21% of the area. In Pakistan, only 28% can be&#13;
classified in these categories and they account for only 5% of the&#13;
cultivated area. In Bangladesh, finally some 83% of the holdings&#13;
must be classified as small, marginal or near-landless, and these&#13;
account for nearly 51% of the total area cultivated. The near-&#13;
landless are an especially large category accounting for 33% of&#13;
the holdings in India and 25% in Bangladesh. (See Table 2.3).&#13;
Over the decade 1960-70 in India and Bangladesh there was a&#13;
drastic downwqard shift in the size distribution of holdings (Tables&#13;
2.4 - 2.7). As population pressure has increased, the number of&#13;
small holdings has increased, although their average size has not&#13;
changed much. Whereas in 1960-61 holdings of less than 5 acres&#13;
accounted for 62% of the holdings and 18 1/2% of the total cultivated&#13;
area in India, by 1970-71 they accounted for 70% of the holdings and&#13;
21% of the cultivated area. The most dramatic changes took place&#13;
for holdings of less than one acre: whereas in 1960-61 they accounted&#13;
for only 18% of the holdings, by 1970-71 they accounted for 33%. The&#13;
data for Bangladesh reveal a similar dismal trend. Households with&#13;
less than 5 acres accounted for 77% of the holdings and 42% of the&#13;
area in 1960*-61; by 1967-68 they accounted for 83% of the holdings&#13;
and 51% of thle area. The data for Pakistan reveal an opposite trend.&#13;
Holdings of less than 5 acres in 1960-61 accounted for 49% of the&#13;
holdings and 10% of the cultivated area; by 1972 they accounted&#13;
for only 28% of the holdings and only 5% of the area. The changes&#13;
in Pakistan have come mainly through an increase in the medium&#13;
(7.5 - 25 acres) and large farm sizes (50 to 150 acres) while in&#13;
Bangladesh and India the shift has been from holdings of between&#13;
5 and 12 acr(es to holdings of less than 2.5 acres.&#13;

B. Small Farm Characteristics&#13;
Most small farmers share a set of common characteristics.&#13;
These characteristics define the economic parameters for policy&#13;
actions, and a proper understanding of them is a first necessary&#13;
step toward increasing small farmer productivity. They include:&#13;
- A high proportion of land devoted to food crops in orde:r&#13;
to meet family subsistence needs.&#13;
- A high proportion of output that is retained for home&#13;
consumption or, inversely, a lower ratio of marketed surplus&#13;
to output. 1/&#13;
- A diverse mixture of crops that allows them to hedge rationally&#13;
against both agro-climatic (weather, yields) and market (output&#13;
prices) risks. Crops are often interplanted.&#13;
- A higher degree of risk aversion when faced with either new or&#13;
rapidly changing market, technology or policy conditions.&#13;
Given the small margins that separate their output expectations&#13;
from disaster (starvation) such 'safety first' risk-averse&#13;
behaviour is highly rational and attests to their good economic&#13;
sense.&#13;
- Very low operating capital turnover in production coupled often&#13;
with a higher debt burden in relation to their resources. This&#13;
contradiction is due to their need to borrow heavily for consump-&#13;
tion purposes in order to sustain the family from one production&#13;
cycle to another. Thus, paradoxically, they rely heavily upon&#13;
creditors but use little of their borrowed capital directly&#13;
for production. 2/&#13;
- Labor, not surprisingly, is the most important input into pro-&#13;
duction as it is relatively abundant. Most of it is supplied&#13;
by the family. Scarce factors like land and capital are econo-&#13;
mized, and factor proportions reflect higher labor intensities&#13;
in production.&#13;
l/  This is on an annual basis.   Often small farmers resort to "distress&#13;
selling" immediately after harvest in order to meet their debt or&#13;
other obligations, even though they need their output to meet their&#13;
own needs, only to purchase these requirements later, often at higher&#13;
prices and with additional debt.&#13;
2/  One would have to say directly because using credits for consumption&#13;
is a form of indirect use for production, specially if without this&#13;
the family labor effort, an essential input into production, is&#13;
subsequently reduced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
-   L'I.re are few on-farm investments exzept-those that are&#13;
carried out through the direct use of family labor for farm&#13;
improvement.   These direct investments are both significant&#13;
and an important part of the process of capital accumulation.&#13;
- Few market linkages exist and whefre t!ey do they are weak.&#13;
Forward linkages are weak because a smaller proportion of the&#13;
output is sold, and backward linkages because fewer market in-&#13;
pu+-q are used.  Actually both weaknesses reinforce each other&#13;
in a vicious circle, especially where the only hope for pro-&#13;
ductivity increases lies in the use of new market inputs&#13;
(fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation water). (Low output&#13;
means low marketable surplus after subsistence requirements&#13;
have been met; this leads to low or non-existent cash incomes,&#13;
which are essential to purchase rnarket inputs, without which&#13;
further increases in output are not possible.)&#13;
Fundamentally, although difficult to quantify, the weakness of&#13;
forward and backward linkages is the one basic characteristic by which&#13;
we can distinguish the "small farmer" syndrome. 1/ It is the most&#13;
binding characteristic which prevents new market and technological&#13;
opportunities from filtering down to the small farmer. Thus, the&#13;
small farm family is easily recognized--as "a family owning, more&#13;
often leasing small, often discontinuous plots and trading in a local&#13;
village market, with little access to supplies and services essential&#13;
to modern technologies, without expectation of living much above the&#13;
subsistence level, and without political influence.' 2/&#13;
It is useful to remove a few inisconceptions about small farmers.&#13;
They are often thought of as the unproductive, inefficient part of&#13;
the agricultural sector. This is just not so: there is ample evi-&#13;
dence to show that small farmers generally have higher yields per acre, 3/&#13;
and often higher overall productivity, have higher cropping intensities,&#13;
more area proportionally under irrigation, and use their resources&#13;
more efficiently. Although data are scarce their production appears&#13;
to have grown just as rapidly as larger farmers'. Further, there is&#13;
growing evidence that when small farmers have had access to new tech-&#13;
nologies, and where these technologies have been nrofitable and within&#13;
their means, they have been equally responsive and eager to adopt tnem.&#13;
T'hey are not equally price-responsive but this is both because they&#13;
need to meet their subsistence needs, leaving a lower margin -or&#13;
market response, and because given their precarious situation&#13;
1/  Thus, one can have a very large feudal holding with a large income&#13;
and production capacity (say,a self-sufficient monastery) that could&#13;
be considered "small" as long as it fails to integrate into the eco-&#13;
nomy around it. This is because the same type of problems would&#13;
prevent this unit from respondinq to new market or technological&#13;
opportunities, as prevent a small farmer.&#13;

3/  This is true generally for India and Bangladesh, but the opposite&#13;
has been reported for Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20 -&#13;
they are more risk-averse. But these are totally rational responses&#13;
and are a reflection of their circumstances, not their poor esconomic&#13;
performance.  1/ Once these characteristics are well understood, we&#13;
are in a position to ask how small farmer productivity increases can&#13;
be brought about.&#13;
1/ Again there is a good deal of microeconomic evidence that could&#13;
be presented here. Some of it is pursued in a later section but&#13;
much of it is left out because of lack of time to document it fully&#13;

The main constraints on increasing productivity on small farms are&#13;
of various types. They include:&#13;
the acrronomic and technological constraints such as the quality&#13;
of land, the amount of water available, the climate, soils, their&#13;
fertility, the type of seeds and nutrients used, the cropping&#13;
practices followed, the type of pest infestations and disease,&#13;
and finally the yield responses to the use of various inputs.&#13;
The major problem in this area is the limited availability of&#13;
agricultural technologies specially adapted to small farm con-&#13;
ditions. The remedy is to emphasize labor-intensive, cash-&#13;
saving, skill-and management-saving technologies that are suited&#13;
to small farm systems. This point is discussed in some detail&#13;
below.&#13;
econornic constraints that have to do with how farmers respond&#13;
to market and other incentives. These constraints ultimately&#13;
stem from the low productivity and incomes that result from&#13;
poor output prices and limited incentives for marketing, and&#13;
the effects of these limited incentives on the crops grown and&#13;
the technologies used. They also include such problems as the&#13;
limited amount of off-farm employment (due to slow overall&#13;
growth in other sectors) available to those who cannot increase&#13;
their income sufficiently through technological change. The&#13;
remedies are to change policies so as to make it easier and&#13;
more profitable for small farmers to adopt technologies that&#13;
would increase their incomes, and to increase employment oppor-&#13;
tunities in the non-farm sector so as to provide employment&#13;
opportunities in rural areas;&#13;
- institutional constraints that limit farmers' access to research,&#13;
extension, credit, marketing, and power and transportation infra-&#13;
structure. The solution lies in the reorientation and redesign&#13;
of institutions (for credit, for marketing, for extension) so&#13;
that they can serve the needs of small farmers;&#13;
-  structural constraint, that center around the problems of small&#13;
uneconomic holdings, extent and security of tenure, the rate of&#13;
rent charged to tenant holders. The solution to this fourth&#13;
set of problems, of course, lies in the areas of tenancy and&#13;
land reform, land consolidation and the redistribution of land--&#13;
the most critical asset in rural areas;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
socio-cultural constraints that have to do with the social&#13;
and cultural development of rural people, and the limited&#13;
understanding among economists of the traditional SystE&gt;ms&#13;
of which the small farmer is a part. The solution lies in&#13;
providing rural education, increased rural literacy, and&#13;
training for farmers, so as to give them greater exposure&#13;
to science and technology, and paying more attention to&#13;
adaptive research so that technologies are suited to their&#13;
needs;&#13;
- finally, there are political constraints which center earound&#13;
the lack of political commitment to agriculture and particularly&#13;
to small farm agriculture. The remedy for this, of course, lies&#13;
with governments themselves. Such a commitment is unlikely to&#13;
be made unless governments are aware of both the severity of&#13;
the problems and the states involved and, in part, of the types&#13;
of solutions that are available to solve them.&#13;
Leaving aside the socio-cultural and political constraints, the&#13;
limitations on small farmers' ability to raise their productivity&#13;
operate through four distinct but connected sets of relationships:&#13;
-  Agronomic-technological relationshi s.   How far output can be&#13;
increased by changes in the application of inputs, using a&#13;
given technology, depends partly upon the level at which&#13;
inputs are presently being used by small farmers and pairtly&#13;
upon the marginal response of outputs to the inputs being&#13;
used.&#13;
-  Economic relationships   between input and output prices&#13;
(hence pricing policies) determine whether it is economically&#13;
profitable for small farmers to use given inputs more inten-&#13;
sively at any given margin. Price relationships also dleter-&#13;
mine the share of the input costsor the output benefits that&#13;
accrues to small farmers. For tenants, the terms of tenancy&#13;
are a critical factor in decisions about whether to rai.se&#13;
output. Tax and subsidy policies, and the efficiencies with&#13;
which resources are used, also affect the profitability to&#13;
farmers of raising production.&#13;
-  Institutional relationships pertain to the way in which&#13;
markets as well as non-market (public-private) institutions&#13;
function or fail to function for small farmers, thus deter-&#13;
mining their conditions of access to knowledge of new inputs&#13;
or to the inputs themselves. Monopoly and monopsony condi-&#13;
tions in commodity and factor markets in rural areas tend to&#13;
bias these markets against the economically weak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
- Structural Relationships pertain to the conditions of&#13;
tenancy (both economic and non-economic-feudal relationships)&#13;
and the distribution of land and other productive assets in&#13;
rural areas. These initial conditions cannot be changed&#13;
withouit a major overhaul of the entire economic, social&#13;
and political relationships in an economy. 1/&#13;
Thus, in determining what factors (inputs and institutional&#13;
changes) are likely to increase small farmer productivity, we need&#13;
to ask (i) whlat inputs are likely to increase the output (yield per&#13;
hectare) of small farmers, and by how much? (ii) are these yield&#13;
increases likely to accrue as increased incomes to small farmers, and&#13;
if so by how much? (iii) do small farmers have knowledge of as well&#13;
as access to new inputs and to institutions that serve them, and if&#13;
not, how can their access be increased? and (iv) are changes in&#13;
structural relationships (tenure conditions and the pize distribution&#13;
of holdings) a precondition for increases in small farmer productivity?&#13;
A. Cropping Practices&#13;
Perhaps the most important small farmer characteristic is the&#13;
availability of labor and the scarcity of cash, knowledge, management&#13;
and organizational skills. An approach to raising productivity that&#13;
uses labor but saves on cash and management skills has been recommended&#13;
by Benor and Harrison (1977). The fundamental concept underlying their&#13;
extension message is to get farmers to do simple things that could&#13;
increase output immediately, and which extension workers could be&#13;
easily taught to carry to farmers. Nothing is recommended that does&#13;
not increase farmers' income and, most importantly, the initial&#13;
concentration is on improving agricultural management practices.&#13;
These practices include better land preparation, improved seed bed&#13;
and nursery maintenance, increased plant populations, use of good seed&#13;
(including appropriate improved varieties), seed treatment, tilling&#13;
operations, weeding, the proper spacing of plants and so on.&#13;
It should be emphasized that the initial stress is on improving&#13;
management practices for several reasons. First, these improved cultural&#13;
practices are said to produce sure results: in adopting them the farmers&#13;
face little risk. Second, while these improved practices need more work&#13;
they require little or no cash outlay. Third, the ability to derive&#13;
the full benefit from new production technologies depends on having&#13;
first learnt good crop management. For example, if farmers apply&#13;
fertilizers to a field that is not properly weeded or the stands of&#13;
1/ This paper cannot possibly cover all the issues related to these&#13;
distinct aspects of the Problem. Attempts are made to look at&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

plant are poor, they end up fertilizing the weeds which compete&#13;
more successfully with crops for available soil, moisture and&#13;
light.  The result can be a lower crop yield rather than higher one.&#13;
Under the Benor-Harrison approach, these practices are at first&#13;
recommended only for a small part of farmers' land, so that they&#13;
do not appear unduly risky, and so that their results can be&#13;
compared with those of traditional practices in farmers    own&#13;
fields. Since these practices are normally quite "well known&#13;
and tested' (so Benor and Harrison maintain), 1/ they can be&#13;
fed into an extension service readily without requiring an&#13;
elaborate, time-consuming screening and trial process.&#13;
Benor and Harrison's method has been found readily assimilable&#13;
in a wide variety of rain-fed and irrigated conditions in a number&#13;
of developing countries. In Turkey, farmers are supposed to have&#13;
increased their cotton yields from 1.7 to 3 tons per hectare in&#13;
three years. In Rajasthan farmers have increased paddy yieldls from&#13;
2.1 to over 3 tons per hectare in two years, a 43% increase. In&#13;
Madhya Pradesh unirrigated and irrigated wheat yields rose from&#13;
1.3 tons to nearly 2 tons per hectare after one season, a nearly 54%&#13;
increase. The area under high yielding paddy and wheat varieties in&#13;
the entire state of West Bengal is reported to have increasedc sub-&#13;
stantially in a single year. As far as can be determined, these&#13;
rapid increases in farm output were not primarily due to an increase&#13;
in irrigation, better weather, discovery of a new variety or more&#13;
fertilizer. In Rajasthan, for example, it was reported that yields&#13;
increased while the use of purchased inputs declined. In irrigated&#13;
areas where the method was adopted, irrigation had been available&#13;
for years but had been poorly managed and used. It is reasonably&#13;
certain that a professional aqricultural extension service&#13;
developed on the same principles in each of these diverse areas&#13;
was a major force behind these changes. 2/&#13;
Benor and Harrison (1977) cite further impressive results.     In&#13;
the Turkey project they report that over a five year period, while&#13;
the extension service expanded coverage to more than 100,000 hectares,&#13;
farm yields increased by more than 220% in cotton, while net profits&#13;
per hectare rose by nearly 900%.    In 1966, they report, no farmers&#13;
in the area had yields as large as 3 tons per ha., while 75% of the&#13;
farmers had yields of less than2 tons per hectare. By 1969, only&#13;
three years later, no farmers had yields of less than 2 tons and 65%&#13;
had yields of 3 tons or more. By 1971, five years later, 95% of the&#13;
farmers had yields above 3 tons, a nearly 200% increase in the region.&#13;
1/  This is not generally true, but in India there is an acctuu-&#13;
lation of agronomic research, especially for crops under irrigated&#13;
conditions, on which present extension systems can rely. The case&#13;
is not so clear for Banqladesh and Pakistan where adaptive agronomi'&#13;
research is not of such lonq standinq,&#13;

In the Chambal area in Madhya Pradesh, although water had been&#13;
available it hlad not been fully utilized and yields were poor. The&#13;
extension service was reformed and new cropping practices introduced&#13;
as part of a broader command area development project. In 1974-75&#13;
the extension service concentrated on increasing the paddy area and&#13;
increasing yields. Paddy yields rose to 2.4 tons per hectare, as&#13;
compared to the average good-weather yield of less than 2 tons per&#13;
hectare before the extension system started, and Daddv vields from&#13;
those fields in which farmers followed all the recommended practices&#13;
increased by more than 85%, to over 3.7 tons per hectare. Wheat&#13;
yields increased by nearly 54% to nearly 2 tons per hectare. Mustard&#13;
yields virtually doubled in one year, to just over one ton per hectare. 1&#13;
In the Chambal area in Rajasthan where a similar project was&#13;
tried, wheat lields increased by nearly 53% in one season and chickpea&#13;
yields rose by 83%. A large proportion of the farmers are said to&#13;
have adopted the recommended practices. In Rajasthan 50% of more&#13;
than 44,000 farmers covered were following some of them; these farmers&#13;
are said to have operated half of the 70,000 hectares of land under&#13;
Rabi crops in the area. The fact that the average farm size of those&#13;
adopting the practices was equal to the average farm size of all the&#13;
farms in the project areas suggests that these practices were being&#13;
followed by farmers in all size classes. The recommendations stress&#13;
improved practices which require more labor, rather than increased&#13;
use of costly inputs, so that small farmers may be able to adopt such&#13;
recommendationis more easily than larger farmers. Finally, it is&#13;
argued that farmer reactions to these simple approaches are uniformly&#13;
enthusiastic. 2/&#13;
As the core of the Bank's attack on rural poverty, particularly&#13;
in India in the past few years, has been to ensure provision of&#13;
improved agricultural extension services so that these improved&#13;
practices can reach large numbers of farmers, it is appropriate&#13;
to examine the evidence further. The most recent evidence comes&#13;
from Rajasthan for the 1976-77 cropping season. Although there&#13;
are some minor differences in the results for the Rabi and Kharif&#13;
seasons, both seem to make the following broad points: 3/&#13;

- There are substantial differences in yields between adopters&#13;
of improved practices (those adopting more than 50% of the&#13;
recommended practices), and non-adopters (less than 50% or&#13;
none),with yield increase for paddy and sorqhum of 40 - 50%&#13;
and a yield increase for wheat and gram of 10-15% (See Table&#13;
3.1).&#13;
- The adoption rates are high for both adopters (and/or contact&#13;
farmers), and non-adopters (other farmers). Furthermore, the&#13;
adoption rates seem to increase over time for all practices;&#13;
from 30% to 70% of all farmers adopting improved practices in&#13;
the first year, to 50% to 90% adopting in the second year&#13;
during which practices have been introduced; (Tables 3.2 and 3.3)&#13;
- Contact farmers show higher rates of adoption than other farmers;&#13;
- The coverage of the area with improved practices is also high,&#13;
especially for paddy where 56% of the area has been planted&#13;
using more than 50% of the recommended practices; (Table 3.2)&#13;
- Neither adopters nor non-adoptersexhibit many significant&#13;
differences in average vields by farm size (except for wheat). 1/&#13;
- High yielding varieties have responded better than local&#13;
varieties to the adoption of improved practices, showing&#13;
much larger increases in yields (38% for HYV and 22% for&#13;
local varieties);&#13;
- Yields seem to increase as more new practices are adopted.&#13;
For example, in the case of sorghum, the yield increases&#13;
over those not using any improved practices were 14%, 22%,&#13;
69%, 72% and 82% respectively for those adopting 1, 2, 3,&#13;
4 and all 5 of the improved practices recommended (Table 3.4);&#13;
- There are no significant differences in the adoption rates&#13;
for different practices by farm size (Table 3.5);&#13;
- In all cases, and this is a critical caveat, yield increases&#13;
were obtained by both   mproved practices and the increased&#13;
use of inputs. Indeed, Benor and Harrison make this quite&#13;
clear because they say that "inputs of seed, fertilizer and&#13;
pestices, effective credit institutions and investments in&#13;
irrigation are needed in order to achieve these kinds of yields."&#13;
(p.4)&#13;
The Rabi crops suffered from drought in 1976/77 so the increased&#13;
yields achieved by improved practices seemed to have been swamped&#13;
by the variations in yields between one year and the next. Yield&#13;
variations among adopters and non-adopters are large enough to&#13;
swamp the yield increases caused by improved practices.&#13;

These results clearly suggest that small farmers have an&#13;
enormous potential for raising yields through simple but "improved"&#13;
cropping practices. The extension system seems to be the key to&#13;
this. 1/ It is less clear how far yields could be increased by&#13;
changes in cropping practices without the use of irrigation water.&#13;
Finally, small farmers may have less than fair access to other&#13;
critical inputs--water, seeds, nutrients, credits--unless irrigation,&#13;
credit and delivery systems are reorganized.&#13;
We need to distinguish carefully between those increases in&#13;
yield that can be achieved merely through the application of increased&#13;
labor, associated with improved practices (and of course knowledge),&#13;
and those that require increased use of other inputs. The basic&#13;
notion that underlies much of the work done by Benor and Harrison&#13;
and others who stress improved farming practices is to reduce the&#13;
yield gap that exists between present yields being obtained by the&#13;
average farmer and the present yields observed on "best farmer"&#13;
fields in the same area. 2/ By identifying both the extent of&#13;
this gap as well as the differences in practices, those practices&#13;
most likely to close the gap are identified. The extent of the&#13;
yield qap can be very large--anywhere from 50% to 250% depending&#13;
on the crop and region (Table 3.E)--and it provides an immediate&#13;
observable measure of the possible potential. From the little data&#13;
available, it seems that the yield increases that can be achieved&#13;
without     any    increase in inputs, by closing these yield gaps,&#13;
range from 15% - 30% for rainfed conditions to between 25% - 50%&#13;
for irrigated conditions, depending on the crop. "See Table 3.6 and&#13;
Table 3.7.) Further increases in yields require either varietal&#13;
changes and/or increased use of inputs such as fertilizers and&#13;
pesticides. It is important to distinguish "pure practice-associated"&#13;
yield increases from those increases brought about by more intensive&#13;
input use,because increased inputs may not be available to small&#13;
farmers, or they may not be profitable to use, a point that has&#13;
often been missed and is pursued in a later section of this paper.&#13;
There are then discrete stages in the adoption of improved&#13;
practices, each stage providing an incremental yield. But not all&#13;
stages are equally accessible to small farmers. Figure 1 below&#13;
(based on data from Assam shown in Table 3.6) makes this point.&#13;
Stage 1 is the "pure cropping practice" change; stage 2a requires&#13;
1/   The fact that the results are from those states in India that&#13;
have shown poor agricultural performance and have large numbers&#13;
of small holders is particularly encouraging.&#13;
2/   These gaps are smaller than those typically cited between&#13;
present yields and those obtained under research conditions.&#13;

varietal changes, while 2b requires additional nutrient use;&#13;
finally stages 3a and 3b involve not only new varieties and&#13;
nutrient use, but also "management-intensive" practices like&#13;
the use of appropriate pesticides. Stage 2 requires market&#13;
and research inputs that mean the reorganization of research,&#13;
extension, and input delivery systems to assure small farmer&#13;
access. Sltage 3 requires management capabilities, which means&#13;
educated farmers able to make day-to-day decisions based on a&#13;
proper understanding of soils, plants, and nutrients.&#13;
In summary then one can state that small farmers can easily&#13;
increase their yields in the range of 10-50% without any increased&#13;
use of inputs, if they are taught better practices. Further&#13;
increases of 75 - 150%, however, will depend upon both the price&#13;
and the availability of inputs, as well as on farmers' access to&#13;
these inputs and to credit with which to purchase them. Finally&#13;
they will depend on small farmers being better educated.&#13;
But one must be very cautious about the data in this section&#13;
and the apparent success they reveal first because the samples are&#13;
small and the evidence is limited, and second because it is too&#13;
early to evaluate the full impact of the changes over time. At&#13;
best, these magnitudes should be treated as only indicative of the&#13;
type of yield increases that can be brought about by changing only&#13;
simple cropping practices.&#13;
B. Scientific Multiple Cropping&#13;
It is possible to make fuller use of the little land available&#13;
to small fairmers by multiple cropping, growing more than one crop&#13;
on the same piece of land in a given year. Multiple cropping makes&#13;
possible bcth an increase in area cropped per year, and an increase&#13;
in total yield per unit of area. There is a need for a change in&#13;
the traditional emphasis from maximizing yields per unit area to&#13;
maximizing yields per unit area per unit time:&#13;
"Though an age old practice with farmers of the (sub-continent)&#13;
multiple cropping has gained considerable importance lately. lip&#13;
to the early sixties multiple cropping was mostly practiced&#13;
around urban areas with vegetable crops and by use of sewage&#13;
irrigation. The recent concept of scientific multiple cropping&#13;
is an outcome of the development of assured i.rrigation resources,&#13;
awareness of the value of commercial fertilizers and the deve-&#13;
lopment of short duration high-yielding varieties of cereals,&#13;
grain legumes and other crops. The practice aims at maximizing&#13;
production and economic returns per unit area per unit time." 1/&#13;

Table 3.8 shows that while in the 1960s 15% - 40% of the area&#13;
was multiple cropped in South Asia, 30% to nearly 80% of the area&#13;
was multiple cropped in other Southeast Asian countries. Further,&#13;
the multiple crop area has not increased much over the past 25 years&#13;
in the sub-continent, in spite of the increase in irrigation with&#13;
which it is highly associated. The index of multiple cropping has&#13;
remained fairly stable for India at between 112 and 115. 1/ For&#13;
Pakistan it has been even lower, but the range is about the same.&#13;
In Bangladesh a larger percentage of the area is multiple cropped--&#13;
nearly 30% - 40% over the past two decades, and the trend has been&#13;
positive. (Siee Table 3.9.)&#13;
Although the aggregate data for South Asia suggest that multiple&#13;
cropping could be increased substantially, they do not reflect the&#13;
true potential on small farms. The data in Table 3.10 show that although&#13;
only 9% of the cultivated area is multiple-cropped in India and 10% in&#13;
Pakistan, the area multiple-cropped on farms smaller than 5 acres&#13;
ranges from 16% - 27% for India and from 30% - 52% for Pakistan.&#13;
Further, multiple cropping is inversely related to farm size, as one&#13;
would expect. (Small farmers farm their land more intensively, having&#13;
the available family labor to do it; hence their yield per unit area&#13;
per unit of time is much higher than on large farms.) In Bangladesh&#13;
the figures are even more dramatic. Whereas 53% of the cultivated&#13;
area in Bangladesh is multiple cropped, the figures for farms less&#13;
than 5 acres show a multiple-cropped area of 58% - 82%. Indeed, for&#13;
farms under 1 acre the cropping intensity is almost as high as that&#13;
in the Republic of China, often cited as the prime exponent of effective&#13;
multiple cropping systems. For more small farms in India and Pakis-0&#13;
tan to produce two crops per year will eventually depend upon the&#13;
availability of irrigation and other inputs. In Bangladesh, on the&#13;
other hand, farmers on the average are already getting nearly two&#13;
crops a year, so we are really talking about trying to get three&#13;
crops a year.&#13;
The management demands of multiple cropping can be substantial.&#13;
Necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for the wider adopticn of&#13;
multiple cropping include (i) the use of imrproved varieties; (ii)&#13;
better water control; (iii) further inputs of fertilizer; (iv)&#13;
better insect and disease controls; and (v) more efficient post-&#13;
harvest technologies.&#13;
l/  See Table 3.   for definition of the multiple cropping index.&#13;
Another similar but slightly different measure is the "cropping&#13;
intensity" measured by the ratio of "gross cropped area" (net&#13;
area sown plus "areas sown more than once") to cultivated area.&#13;
See D. Dalrymple (1970) p. 1-8 for some definitional problems&#13;
in measuring multiple cropping.&#13;

First, tDhe role of crop varieties is central. Increases in&#13;
availability of early maturing varieties are generally associated&#13;
with an increase in multiple cropping. 1/   One of the most important&#13;
factors in increasing cropping intensities is the time crops take to&#13;
ripen, for the shorter the growing season required by individual&#13;
crops, the greater the possibility of raising an additional crop&#13;
within the available growing season. For this reason, photo period-&#13;
insensitive varieties are needed.   Further desired characteristics,&#13;
for grain varieties especially, are yield rather than vegetative&#13;
responsivenGoo to fertilizers, short, strong stems that limit: logging,&#13;
as much insect and disease resistance as possible, and consumer&#13;
acceptance. Further, those varieties which are to be grown in rain-&#13;
fed areas often need to be drought-resistant. The high-yielding&#13;
varieties (HYV) of wheat and rice developed in the late sixties&#13;
have many of these characteristics and their extensive adoption&#13;
is particularly important for expanded multiple cropping syst.ems.&#13;
Second, since the rainfall in large areas of South Asia is&#13;
both inadequate and improperly distributed for multiple cropping,&#13;
increased irrigation becomes an essential too. Here the policy&#13;
conflict is often between increasing the supply of water during&#13;
the present, single, crop growing season, or extending the growing&#13;
season over different parts of the year. While irrigation during&#13;
appropriate periods helps make multiple cropping possible, the&#13;
relationship works both ways: multiple cropping may be necessary&#13;
to justify the expense of putting in irrigation. 2/&#13;
The problem with the present extensive irrigation systems in&#13;
South Asia is that they were not designed to maximize output per&#13;
acre, but rather to spread the available supply as widely as&#13;
possible in order to reduce the probability of crop failure. 3/&#13;
This is especially true of canal irrigation, widely    used in the&#13;
sub-continent, since the quantity available is largely dependlent&#13;
on seasonal flows. The principle problem in Pakistan with ceanal&#13;
irrigatiom  aos reported to be unreliability of ouplpy    / When&#13;
canal water io most needed in the dry season or when the secOnd&#13;
crop needs to be grown, it is likely to be in the scarcest supply. 5/&#13;
1/   D.0 Dalrymple (1973, p. 23.&#13;
2/   Indeed, in many of the projects in South Asia this is a necessary&#13;
element. The large number of new CAD type irrigation projects pay&#13;
particular attention to this.&#13;
3/   See Mellor (1968).&#13;
T/   Mohammed (1965) and H. Kaneda and M. Ghaffar (1970).&#13;
5/   D. Dalrymple (1970), p. 25.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
This has led to the rationing of water in the winter in West Pakistan,&#13;
limiting the possibilities of a second crop. 1/ Unless seasonal flows&#13;
are controlled, it is not possible to increase multiple cropped areas.&#13;
Well water is less subject to seasonal variations and supply as also&#13;
is tubewell irrigation.&#13;
There is clear evidence that in most regions where tubewell&#13;
irrigation is practiced, the cropping index is higher than in canal-&#13;
irrigated regions. For example, in the Indian Punjab the cropping&#13;
intensity in well-irrigated regions in 1968/69 was 150% as opposed&#13;
to 125% in ca,nal-irrigated areas. Moreover, it is projected that by&#13;
the 1980s, the intensity will increase to between 180 - 200%. 2/&#13;
Similarly, in West Pakistan in 1963/64 the cropping intensity of&#13;
tubewell farmers in three districts averaged about 138%, as opposed&#13;
to 101% for n,on-tubewell farmers. The increased use of tubewells&#13;
has made significant contributions towards overcoming the problems&#13;
associated with irregular water supply in large areas of Pakistan&#13;
and Northern India, and this strategy should be replicated elsewhere.&#13;
But to the extent that tubewell water is out of the reach of small&#13;
farmers either because the initial investment costs are too large&#13;
(as in the case of private tubewells), or because for economic and&#13;
political reasons they are the last to receive water (as in the case&#13;
of public tubewells) their impact may be much smaller on the small&#13;
farm sector than on a region as a whole.&#13;
The provision of irrigation and water is only one aspect of the&#13;
water control problem. Drainage is the other major factor. Adequate&#13;
drainage is needed in the short run in order that proper irrigation&#13;
is provided and, over the longer run, to avoid chronic waterlogging&#13;
of the soil, or the build-up of salinization as has occurred exten-&#13;
sively in Pakistan. If drainage schemes are in the hands of local&#13;
elites, small farmers may again come last in receiving adequate&#13;
assistance.&#13;
Thirdly, one of the drawbacks of multiple cropping is that it&#13;
impoverishes the soil. The third essential element in the increased&#13;
use of multiple cropping on small farms is the use of organic or&#13;
1/ S. M. Hussain (1970). When bureaucratic rationing systems govern&#13;
the distribution of resources, it is almost an axiom of human&#13;
behavior that the rich and powerful will get their needs met&#13;
first.&#13;

chemical fertilizers to reinvigorate the soil. 1/ Although&#13;
extensive work has been done on the new high yielding varieties,&#13;
relatively little is known about the relations between various&#13;
crop rotations and fertilization needs. Ultimately small&#13;
farmers' use of fertilizer depends on ti) whether they have&#13;
access to supplies and (ii) whether they find it profitable.&#13;
Without increased nutrient use extensive double and multiple&#13;
cropping systems will be difficult to sustain. 2/&#13;
Fourth, multiple cropping provides a longer period for plant&#13;
life which in turn is likely to increase insect and disease problems.&#13;
Moreover, some of the newer high yielding varieties are much more&#13;
susceptible to local diseases or insects than native varieties in&#13;
the sub-continent.&#13;
There are four possible solutions. 3/ (i) Step up chemical&#13;
control measures; (ii) breed for natural plant resistance; (iii)&#13;
attempt biological control; or (iv) arrange rotations so that no&#13;
two crops sharing the same pests and disease are grown in sequence.&#13;
The first three have particular difficulties and limitations.&#13;
Chemical control can be expensive and cause ecological problems.&#13;
Besides, pesticides are cash-intensive and may be out of reach of&#13;
small farmers. Breeding and biological controls take considerable&#13;
time to develop and it is not certain whether all the research for&#13;
this has been done, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan. The last&#13;
method, the proper arrangement of rotations, is a logical starting&#13;
point. Again, what can be accomplished depends on adaptive research&#13;
into farming systems especially suited to small farmer conditions and&#13;
1/   More than 20 years ago Indian scientists developed a simple&#13;
method of using the slurry from bio-gas plants (which ferment&#13;
cow dung to yield methane for use as fuel and a nitrogen-enriched&#13;
slurry for use as fertilizer) as a starter for compost heaps.&#13;
Mixing the resulting manure with small quantities of urea and&#13;
super-phosphates produced a fertilizer with twice as much&#13;
efficiency per gram of nutrient as urea alone. But in the 1960s&#13;
the glamour of chemical fertilizers caused everyone to forget&#13;
the virtue of such simple and cheap methods of soil enrichment.&#13;
They were remembered again more recently when price rises in 1974&#13;
put chemical fertilizers out of      reach for all Indian farmers&#13;
but the richest. The untapped potential in the sub-continent to&#13;
use cow dung to produce both fuel and soil-enriching organic fer-&#13;
tilizers is enormous and needs to be further developed, especially&#13;
for small farms which lack the cash to buy either fuel or chemical&#13;
fertilizers.&#13;

needs on the sub-continent.&#13;
Thus, the substantial potential for multiple cropping in&#13;
South Asia cannot be realized without increased water control,&#13;
without the development of new varieties, without increased fertilizer&#13;
use, without the proper control of insects, disease and weeds, or,&#13;
finally, the development of appropriate rotational systems. The poten-&#13;
tial is considerably less for small than for larger farmers, first&#13;
because they are already cropping their land more intensively, second,&#13;
because their access to these necessary new inputs may be limited, and&#13;
finally because to increase the area under multiple cropping, especiall&#13;
with cropping intensity over 150% - 160%, requires a huge advance in&#13;
farmers' management capability. Small farmers are shrewd decision&#13;
makers, but they generally lack the literacy and knowledge to handle&#13;
complex crop systems scientifically.&#13;
The most critical management problem is of course timing. In&#13;
South Asia, with its year-round sunshine and no climatic barriers to&#13;
three or even four crops a year, the key obstacle is the length or&#13;
timing of the traditional growing season. 1/ As more crops are&#13;
planted within a given season and the growing period between them&#13;
is shortened, it is clear that less time is left between the harvest&#13;
of one crop and the planting of the next. Minimizing the number of&#13;
days the land is left idle is a very heavy burden on the farm manager.&#13;
A large number of operations need to be carried out in a relatively&#13;
short period.   The relatively abundant supply of labor on small farms&#13;
may work to their advantage here. But as regards other inputs, small&#13;
farmers may be at a disadvantage. If seeds, nutrients and irrigation&#13;
water are not available on time, they might as well not be available,&#13;
and if the small farmers have to stand in line to get these inputs,&#13;
then their timing is upset and the probability of succeeding with&#13;
multiple cropping practices is reduced.&#13;
It is noteworthy that even where adaptive research has provided&#13;
appropriate cropping rotations which could be used in parts of India&#13;
and Bangladesh, the problem of timing has prevented their wider adoptic&#13;
I/   Thus, for example, in Northeast India where there is plentiful&#13;
rain it has not been possible to sow a wheat crop on the land&#13;
in addition to rice because the paddy takes at least 5 1/2 months&#13;
to matuire and harvesting is seldom completed before the middle of&#13;
December. Similarly, in Bihar and Eastern U.P. the nursery beds&#13;
are planted in June and the seedlings are not ready to be trans-&#13;
planted until late July or early August. As a result, the crop&#13;
does not ripen until late autumn when days are relatively short&#13;
and nights are cold, so that a second crop is not possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There is little margin in most of these rotations for delays caused&#13;
either by weather or by unavailability of inputs. A delay in&#13;
maturity may lessen yield or create problems in harvesting or&#13;
planting the following crop. 1/ Mechanization, which has been&#13;
widely adopted in some parts of the sub-continent, is one solutic...i&#13;
to the problem, but creates its own difficulties and is not a&#13;
viable alternative for small farmers. Timing will continue to be&#13;
a problem in developing viable multiple cropping systems unless&#13;
input delivery systems are geared to provide timely access to&#13;
inputs for small farmers.&#13;
If these problems can be effectively tackled the benefits; to&#13;
small farmers and the agricultural sector as a whole could be con-&#13;
siderable, for multiple cropping can virtually double the demand&#13;
for labor and raise the net incomes of the poorest farmers by 30=60%.&#13;
Returns from multiple cropping are highly variable and depend partly&#13;
on the frequency of cropping and partly on the types of crops included&#13;
in a given frequency0 Although in a few cases the net returns per unit&#13;
of land have decreased the greater likelihood is for an increase,&#13;
tapering off as cropping intensities increase0 2/ Further there is&#13;
some evidence that increased returns are in part a function of manage-&#13;
ment skill0 3/&#13;
An example of the possible net impact of multiple cropping systems&#13;
on income is shown in Table 3.llo Increases over single cropping&#13;
incomes are low unless one moves beyond double to triple and quadruple&#13;
cropping,when increases in the range of 50 - 100% are possible0 We do&#13;
not know how representative these data are, so it is difficull: to assess&#13;
the increased net incomes that would accrue to small farmers0 It is&#13;
nonetheless important to note that where the farm holding is very&#13;
small and off-farm employment opportunities are few, it may be necessary&#13;
for the operators to move to higher rotations (intensities) just to&#13;
maintain a minimal income0 For these groups multiple cropping may be&#13;
a last chance for survival rather than a step into influence0 Such a&#13;
tendency is clearly evident from the data on cropping intensities on&#13;
/  In the case of certain Kharif crops in India, a delay of one week&#13;
in sowing reportedly delays crop maturity by two weeks or more0&#13;
See A0 S. Kahlon (1970)0&#13;
2/  Aside from the considerable evidence from the Republic of China and&#13;
the Philippines available in IRRI publications, a detailed study in&#13;
India showed that when the index of returns was set at 100 for&#13;
double cropping, triple cropping produced an index of 149 while&#13;
quadruple cropping had an index of 191. See Singh and Clhoubey&#13;
(1969), and Swaminathan (1972)0&#13;

small farms in Bangladesh. 1&#13;
While there is good reason to believe that total labor use is&#13;
increased substantially with multiple cropping only limited empirical&#13;
evidence is available. Data from a sample of progressive farmers in&#13;
the Indian Punjab during the 1960s indicate that labor requirements&#13;
increase faster than the cropping intensities. 2/ Some evidence from&#13;
north-west India, presented in Table 3.12, shows that while quadruple&#13;
cropping increases agricultural production by about threefold, the&#13;
demand for labor rises about five fold. 3/ But labor requirements&#13;
also vary considerably with the type of water supply, crops, vearieties&#13;
and the cropping intensities used. Canal irrigation requires twice&#13;
the labor of tubewells, while persian wheels require ten times more&#13;
again. 4/   When sugarcane is included in the rotation labor require-&#13;
ments are far higher than when other crops are included. Improved&#13;
crop varieties require more labor per unit of land (althouglh not&#13;
always per unit of output) than traditional varieties. Finally,&#13;
the range in labor requirements is widened as one moves from single&#13;
to double and from double to triple cropping.&#13;
As a result it is very difficult to assess the aggregate additional&#13;
employment that could be generated if multiple cropping were adopted&#13;
more extensively.   One such estimate for India shown in Table 3.13&#13;
suggests that around 17 million additional persons could be employed&#13;
in agricultural production. The second and tertiary impact on employ-&#13;
ment in input services and transportation would be additional. S/&#13;
It is not certain to what extent the increased labor required by&#13;
multiple cropping would expand the (net) number of jobs, and to what&#13;
extent it would simply serve to reduce the underemployment of existing&#13;

inverse relationship between farm size and cropping intensities.&#13;
~/ Thus if the cropping intensities increase from 100% to 150% labor&#13;
requirements increased from 100% to 170%. See S. S. Johl (1970)o&#13;

farm labor. Experience in Pakistan shows that an increase in&#13;
multiple cropping has led to a less than comparable increase in&#13;
the farm labor force, suggesting a substantial degree of previous&#13;
underemployment. 1/ The same must be true for India and Bangladesh.&#13;
If labor requirements increase substantially large operators who&#13;
have to hire labor might find further increases in cropping inten-&#13;
sity unattract:Lve, while smaller operators who rely on their family&#13;
labor may find them very profitable especially in the case where&#13;
few off-farm jobs are available and no loss of wage incomes follows.&#13;
Severe undleremployment during much of the year, especially on&#13;
small family farms, would also be reduced. Farm management studies&#13;
in India have shown that nearly 25-30% of the family labor engaged&#13;
in farming is not gainfully employed because farm operations are&#13;
not evenly spread over the year. 2/ Multiple cropping clearly helps&#13;
shorten slack periods, but the problem of seasonal peaks in the demand&#13;
for labor during planting and harvesting is likely to be exacerbated.&#13;
Mechanization often follows as a result. 3/ How much this will affect&#13;
small farmers will depend upon a host of factors. But eventually some&#13;
form of labor-saving machines for harvesting and planting operations&#13;
will have to be developed for small farmers,to allow them to meet these&#13;
bottlenecks. 4/ At any rate multiple cropping promises to be a more&#13;
effective means of creating employment (as well as incomes) for the&#13;
growing and already large populations in rural areas than either&#13;
rural industries or rural work programs. 5/ Small farmers and the&#13;
landless will be the most likely beneficiaries if fertilizers and&#13;
water can be delivered to them and the other technological and manage-&#13;
ment problems associated with multiple cropping can be solved under a&#13;
variety of agro-economic conditions.&#13;

Chapter IV: SMALL FARMER POTENTIAL AND INPUT-INTENSIVE&#13;
STRATEGIES&#13;
Chapter III made clear that substantial increases in yields&#13;
are unlikely without the additional use of inputs: These inputs&#13;
include (i) new seeds, nutrients and pesticides, (ii) water,&#13;
(iii) credit and (iv) knowledge and management skills. This&#13;
chapter examines the potentials and problems inherent in the use&#13;
and availability of these inputs for small farmers.&#13;
A. High Yielding Varieties and Nutrient Use&#13;
Although the "green revolution" technologies are supposed to&#13;
be technically scale-neutral, it has been argued that small farmers&#13;
have adopted them to a far smaller degree because they have not had&#13;
adequate access to the necessary inputs, and hence that the grins have&#13;
gone disproportionately or even solely to large farmers. 1/ The&#13;
evidence from research is not conclusiveo _&#13;
The fairly extensive evidence from India is mixed. Laidejinsky&#13;
(1969, 1973) noted that only 18.5? of the recommended amounts of&#13;
fertilizer were being applied by small farmers even though ample&#13;
supplies were available, and cited lack of water supply andl credit&#13;
as the basic reasons for this. He noted rapid rates of adoption of&#13;
HYV wheat, but that the majority of rice growers had preferred to&#13;
retain traditional strains because of their certain, althouch lower,&#13;
yields. Especially in the eastern belt of India, which lay outside&#13;
the purview of the new technology, a large proportion of the culti-&#13;
vated rice area was in small holdings. He noted the deterioration&#13;
of tenurinl conditions as a direct consequence of the green revo-&#13;
lution and warned against what he termed "the old squeeze whereby&#13;
tenants are reduced to sharecroppers, eventually to landless workers,&#13;
as more of the bigger owners become involved with the new tech-&#13;
nologies.' He agreed that the green revolution was neutral to scale,&#13;
because its inputs were divisible, but that this neutrality broke&#13;
down when it came to securing credit.  Hmny potentially vialble farmers&#13;
remained non-Vviable because credit was not within their reach.&#13;

In a detailed study on the use of nutrients for the maize&#13;
crop in Bihar, Ojha (1970) noted that the per acre application of&#13;
various fertilizer nutrients was much lower on small farms. The&#13;
percentage of farmers using recommended dosages was much lower&#13;
among small farmers, as were the average expenditures per acre on&#13;
chemical fertilizer for both hybrid as well as local varieties.&#13;
As a consequence, as all small farmers planted larger proportions&#13;
of their area under hybrid maize than did larger farmers, they&#13;
tended to spread the fertilizer more thinly. As a result , yields&#13;
were much lower on small farms. Credit was a critical constraint.&#13;
Schluter and Mellor (1972) noted that small farmers were&#13;
particularly willing to innovate where this was profitable and not&#13;
unduly risky. Thus, over time, small farmers increased the acreage&#13;
under new varieties, but this increase was consistent with credit&#13;
being a constraint on their adoption of new varieties. Through&#13;
1967-69, small farmers were lagging in adoption, having to rely&#13;
heavily on credit. The joint problem of credit and uncertainty&#13;
also affected the choice of cropping pattern. Further, Schluter&#13;
and Mellor found that to the extent that small farmers used coop-&#13;
erative credit and large farmers used their own funds, the former&#13;
may have had to pay more for credit than large farms.&#13;
Michie (1973) found that although there was evidence of higher&#13;
yields per a,cre on small farms, lack of access to critical inputs&#13;
prevented small farmers from taking full advantage of the new&#13;
technologies. Similarly, Dasgupta's (1977) study showed no evidence&#13;
that the new technology was "percolating" from large to smaller&#13;
farms, while there was a growing inequality in land distribution&#13;
and the new technology had no discernible positive impact on income&#13;
distribution.&#13;
Frankel (1971) found that in rice growing regions,where the&#13;
majority of farmers have uneconomic holdings of 2-3 acres, the&#13;
increased yields have been too low to create adequate capital either&#13;
to develop land or to increase yields further. The few yield increases&#13;
that have occurred have been offset by the rising cost of living for&#13;
the small farmer, where land has to be leased. Thus she argues that&#13;
the economic conditions of the small farmer deteriorated absolutely.&#13;
Most income from increased yields due to high application of ferti-&#13;
lizers is spent on consumption; in a few instances in West Bengal&#13;
it has been used to purchase modern inputs.&#13;
Lipton (1977) argues that the price incentives affecting the&#13;
adoption of high-yielding varieties appeared to have favored larger&#13;
farmers. He cites evidence from Rao (1972), Bari (1975) and Swenson&#13;
(1973) to argue that large farmers in South India made substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
gains from increased production and privileged market access in the&#13;
wake of the high-yielding varieties. The smaller farmers who were&#13;
latecomers invariably benefited less because the output growth&#13;
achieved in the earlier stages brought down the relative prices of&#13;
crops concerned. This price structure therefore (i) reduced small&#13;
farmers' capacity,relative to that of large farmers, to repay&#13;
and obtain loans, (ii) cumulatively increased the bigger farmers.&#13;
capacity to finance further innovations, and (iii) forced smell&#13;
farmers to pay high input prices, while decreasing their cash return&#13;
on high-yielding varieties. Lipton also cites small farmers"&#13;
limited access to credit as limiting their output. Evidence from&#13;
studies by Wills (1972) of Uttar Pradesh, and by Raj Purohit (1972)&#13;
of Mysore, also suggests that lack of credit is a major barrier to&#13;
access to new technologies. Traditional credit, Lipton argues, at&#13;
times requires a lien, sometimes a hereditary lien, on some of the&#13;
borrower's labor, especially if he happens to rent part of his land.&#13;
If the loan cannot be repaid, his labor may be called upon at times&#13;
when it is needed by the small producer himself. This may not only&#13;
discourage but prevent the small farmer from buying modern inputs.&#13;
All these studies contend that either small farmers have not&#13;
taken up new technologies or that their adoption has been limited&#13;
by access to inputs: water, fertilizers and most critically credit.&#13;
But much of this evidence is anecdotal and facts are hard to come&#13;
by. The new technologies have had their greatest impact in wheat,&#13;
where the new HYVs have produced much higher yields and were well&#13;
suited to growing conditions in most parts of India. As a result&#13;
nearly two-thirds of India's wheat area is planted to HYVso The&#13;
evidence on small farmer participation on these areas is more&#13;
sanguine.&#13;
Bhattacharya and Majid (1976) in a detailed study based on&#13;
twelve villages in the Indian Punjab showed that small farmers&#13;
were adopting new technologies fairly quickly and extensively and&#13;
that there was little evidence either of distress selling of land&#13;
or unwise use of purchased inputs. Similarly, Sen (1970) states&#13;
that nearly two-thirds of the beneficiaries of the new technology&#13;
have been small farmers. Menchar (1974) found that where new seeds&#13;
were available, small farmers had begun to adopt them even though&#13;
no extension efforts were being made to reach them; with more&#13;
assistance, this adoption could have been considerably increased.&#13;
There is even broader evidence that small farmers have&#13;
adopted new technologies. The most extensive and recent study of&#13;
adoption of HYVs available indicates that small farmers have adopted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
HYV wheat as extensively as large farmers. 1/ In the earlier&#13;
years small farmers were slower to adopt,reflecting partly their&#13;
risk aversion to new "experimental" varieties and partly the&#13;
concentration of extension efforts on larger farmers.    Even then&#13;
there were areas -- notably Punjab -- where small farmers adopted&#13;
HYVs as rapidly as larger farmers. By the mid-70s however,&#13;
differenccs in the adoption rate between larger and small farmers&#13;
had disappeared. 2/ There is similar evidence from NCAER Studies&#13;
(see Table 4.1).&#13;
In rice the spread of HYVs has not been as rapid, extensive&#13;
or consistent as for wheat. Rice HYVs were found to be more&#13;
location-specific in their adaption and yield response,and often&#13;
compete in et given area with improved local varieties which may&#13;
yield as much and have other desirable characteristics (better&#13;
taste, shorter duration, lower logging). As a result, HYV rice&#13;
covers less than 30% of the area planted to rice. The PEO/ANU&#13;
study cited above indicates that by 1975 small farmers had not&#13;
adopted these varieties as extensively as larger farmers, though in&#13;
nearly all areas studied they had begun to catch up.&#13;
The evidence from India can be summed up as follows:     (i) small&#13;
farmers have adopted new technologies where these were profitable;&#13;
(ii) although they have lagged behind larger farmers in rice areas,&#13;
they are rapidly catching up; and (iii) by-and-large the real&#13;
problem has not been in the design of the technologies but in the&#13;
access to essential inputs.&#13;
The evidence from Bangladesh is scattered, but generally it&#13;
suggests thaLt small farmers have also been adopting new technologies&#13;
fairly extensively. Asaduzamman and Islam (1972) state that the&#13;
extent of adoption is actually higher among small farmers, particular&#13;
subsistence farmers. Adoption has been highest among owner-cum-&#13;
tenant farmers in Bangladesh (63% of the farmers and 20% of the area&#13;
adopted). Similarly, a study by Faidley and Esmay (1976) showed&#13;
that small and large farmers appeared to have adopted improved rice&#13;
varieties at about the same rate, and to be cultivating with equal&#13;
success. A study by Hossain (1974) attributed higher yields among&#13;
small farmers to their higher application of fertilizers.&#13;

In a study of the cooperative system in the Comilla scheme,&#13;
Bose (1974) has shown the successful adoption of new technology on&#13;
small farms and a fair distribution of the benefits to farmers&#13;
irrespective of their size of holdings. Bose also contends that&#13;
these new technologies have done nothing directly for the landless&#13;
and the very small farmers -- those with less than one hectare.&#13;
Most of the farmers in Bangladesh are small farmers, and, on&#13;
an overall basis, the uptake of new technologies has been slower&#13;
in Bangladesh than in other parts of the sub-continent.&#13;
The evidence from Pakistan shows much more clearly that the&#13;
gains from new technologies and nutrients have gone disproportionately&#13;
to larger farmers. Only a smattering of evidence exists to show&#13;
that small farms have adopted the new technologies.    Salam (1973)&#13;
from a sample of 19 districts in the Punjab (where 90% of his sample&#13;
farms had applied chemical fertilizers) found that the use of&#13;
nutrients was-significantly higher on small farms, and that they&#13;
were using higher amounts of land-saving factor inputs, such as&#13;
fertilizer.  The sourcs of financing for these inputs werepersonal&#13;
savings and non-institutional credit sources,which were the most&#13;
important source, especially for small farms. Similarly,;Kaneda&#13;
and Naseem (1972) also observed the ease with which divisible inputs&#13;
were adopted by small farmers in the Punjab. Even though tubewells&#13;
are lumpy inputs, small farmers in the Punjab were taking advantage&#13;
of these too.&#13;
The Pakistan evidence on the opposite side is much more&#13;
extensive. For example, Amjad (1972) argued that though since the&#13;
late 1960s the application of fertilizers on high yielding varieties&#13;
had become a very important source for productive increases in&#13;
Pakistan, most of the area not covered by high yielding varieties&#13;
was   on  small farms.   Amjad gave four reasons for this:   (i) it&#13;
was not profitable at government-support prices; (ii) they were&#13;
unable to undertake the necessary financial investments; and&#13;
(iii) the important inputs were monopolized by large farmers. He&#13;
argued that in 1972 nearly 80% of the farms less than 5 acres&#13;
used no fertilizers, apparently due to lack of funds and irrigation.&#13;
These reasons also restricted the application of nutrients on 7 to&#13;
12 acre farms to half the average per acre used on larger farms,&#13;
whether on high yielding varieties or local varieties.&#13;
Similarly, Gotsch (1971, 1976) argues that large farmers were&#13;
the first to learn about new technologies because they had better&#13;
access to extension in research institutions and were able, unlike&#13;
small farmers, to reach optimum factor combinations by their access&#13;
to credit. He argues that the diffusion of technology in Pakistan&#13;
was a source of income disparity, even though the technology itself&#13;
was perfectly divisible. Similarly, Rochin (1976) in an extensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
study in Pakistan concluded that although adoption rates did not&#13;
differ by size classes, subsistence farmers had a slightly lagging&#13;
rate of adoption and used less fertilizer. Small farmers had&#13;
difficulties in securing supplementary irrigation water. He also&#13;
noted that slow growth and low use of new technologies have been&#13;
associated with areas where average size of holdings was small.&#13;
Small farmers have participated only in the simplest forms of the&#13;
Green Revolution and remain to an extent unaware of the next, round&#13;
of improvements in input use.&#13;
Rochin also shows that a very high proportion of smallholders&#13;
in rain-fed (barani) areas have adopted the new Mexi-Pak variety&#13;
of wheat remarkably quickly. He found them to be responsive to&#13;
innovations and making rapid adjustments when profitable seed&#13;
varieties were made available to them.   Though yield increades were&#13;
the main reason for adoption, Mexi-Pak also fitted the cropping&#13;
pattern of the smallholdars easily and did not   need    extensive&#13;
changes in farming practices. These adoptions resulted in greater&#13;
cropping intensities, increased output and increased employment in&#13;
barani areas.&#13;
Part of the reason why the evidence on nutrient use is mixed&#13;
is due to the inappropriate measures of nutrient application used&#13;
in the studies. Most studies have used nutrient use per total&#13;
cropped area, which is not the relevant measure: as small farmers&#13;
have fewer resources they are likely to use scarce inputs like&#13;
nutrients much more carefully. In order to compensate for the&#13;
smaller size of their holdings they farm these holdings more inten-&#13;
sively. As a result the appropriate figure is the fertilizer&#13;
application per hectare not of the total area cropped but of the&#13;
area fertilized.&#13;
There are few data, but when one examines the available&#13;
evidence presented in Table 4.2, one finds that small farmers use&#13;
as much and in many cases more nutrients per hectare of area ferti-&#13;
lized than larger farmers throughout the sub-continent, even in&#13;
Pakistan. If their yields per cropped hectare are lower, this could&#13;
either be because, having fewer financial resources, they fertilized&#13;
a smaller proportion of their areas than larger farmers or because&#13;
they planted a smaller area with HYVs. This is the reason why the&#13;
evidence on yields and the adoption of new technologies is often&#13;
mixed for Pakistan. 1/&#13;
1/  In India at least the evidence contradicts this as small farmers&#13;
fertilized as much of their area as other farmers,nor do they have&#13;
a smaller proportion of their area under HYVs0 Perhaps the "access"&#13;
problem is more serious in Pakistan.&#13;

The weight of the evidence suqqests that small farmers in the&#13;
sub-continent have already moved some distance along the production&#13;
frontiers opened up by new varieties and nutrient use. The problem&#13;
then is to evaluate how much further they have to go. We turn to this&#13;
question next.&#13;
B. Economic Potential from Nutrient Use&#13;
In order to estimate the yield potentials for small farmers&#13;
from more intensive fertilizer use for irrigated and rainfed areas&#13;
we need to know (i) the percentage of their cultivated areas ferti-&#13;
lized; (ii) the intensity of fertilization on the area already&#13;
fertilized; (iii) the yield-responses to nutrient use for at least&#13;
the major food crops and (iv) the economic profitability of addi-&#13;
tional nutrient use, given nutrient and output prices. Where such&#13;
data are available it would be possible to estimate the economic&#13;
potential (in yield and income terms) of the area not fertil:ized&#13;
at all (call it P1), as well as the additional or remaining economic&#13;
potential on the area already fertilized but at levels below the&#13;
economic optimum, given nutrient and output prices ( call this P2).-&#13;
If W  is the proportion of gross area cultivated that is being&#13;
fertilized, then the total economic potential (i.e., W1 P1 +&#13;
(1 - w1) P2 could be estimated for irrigated and rainfed conditions0&#13;
The importance of such an exercise arises from the fact that when&#13;
small farmers' income potentials with respect to nutrient use are&#13;
assessed it is usually assumed that (i) they use little or no&#13;
fertilizers; (ii) fertilize small proportions of their total areat&#13;
(iii) the relevant "yield gaps" are those between zero nutri-ent use&#13;
(base or control yields) and maximum obtainable yields on the response&#13;
curves (usually defined in agronomically attainable terms), which&#13;
are very large; (iv) it would be profitable for small farmers to close&#13;
these gaps at given nutrient/output prices and (v) finally, that they&#13;
have the financial means to do so. These assumptions give an&#13;
unrealistically favorable impression of potential yield increases.&#13;
To begin with, the data in Table '.2 refute the contention&#13;
that small farmers use little or no fertilizers, showing that they&#13;
have already moved some distance along the nutrient-yield response&#13;
boundaries, and that, at least in India and Pakistan, they use at&#13;
least as much and in some cases more than medium and large farmers0&#13;
In Bangladesh the absolute levels are much lower but again application&#13;
rates are not significantly different from those on larger farms0&#13;
Second, from the available evidence on India shownin T'able 4.3&#13;
it is also untrue that small farmers have fertilized only a small&#13;
proportion of their total areas0 Of course the area fertilized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
differs from crop to crop, year to year and depends upon both the&#13;
variety and condition of irrigation. But the evidence suggests&#13;
that (i) a very high proportion of the irrigated area (80-100%)&#13;
as well as the unirrigated area (70-100%) under HYVs is being&#13;
fertilized, attesting to their high response under nutrient use;&#13;
(ii) the area fertilized under traditional varieties is small but&#13;
still substantial under irrigated conditions (35-60% except for&#13;
Jowar), and (iii) the area fertilized under traditional varieties&#13;
and unirrigated conditions is very low (0 - 30%). This is as one&#13;
would expect, because HYVs under irrigation have the highest yield&#13;
response. Further there are no significant differences by farm&#13;
size in the percentages of areas fertilized under various crops. 1/&#13;
Given these facts, how much additional income can be realized&#13;
by following the intensive-nutrient input strategy further on small&#13;
farms? 2/ We have attempted such an exercise for the major food&#13;
crops under irrigated and unirrigated conditions and for traditional&#13;
and HYV varieties from data for India and Bangladesh. The analysis&#13;
and data sources are given in Annex II. The data for India on which&#13;
the analysis is based are fairly reliable; those for Bangladesh are&#13;
more shakey, and at best only indicate broad orders of magnitude.&#13;
1/  There are some differences depending on the crop and variety as&#13;
well as the year for which data are reported but no general&#13;
patterns can be seen which indicate that small farmers ferti-&#13;
lize a smaller proportion of their area. See NCAER (1974).&#13;
2/  Given that there are few significant differences between small&#13;
and larger farms either in the percentages of gross area&#13;
fertilized or in nutrient use per hectare, at least in India&#13;
and Bangladesh, the question can be posed for all farms, and&#13;
results on potential income (at least on a per hectare basis)&#13;
obtained for small farms would be more or less relevant for all&#13;
farms and hence for the sector as a whole.&#13;
Pakistan may be an exception because the scattered evidence&#13;
indicates that small farmers may have lagged considerably&#13;
both in the adoption of HYVs and nutrient use. Unfortunately&#13;
detailed data are unavailable.&#13;

Figure 3 shows the yields as a function of nutrient use with&#13;
respect to a single nutrient - nitrogen. I/ We estimated these&#13;
curves on t:he basis of data available from field trials, in many&#13;
cases combining data from different states. 2/&#13;
Next we estimated the slopes of the nutrient-output price&#13;
ratios (Pu/'Po) for two periods: 1967-1972 and 1972-1974 (the&#13;
former to reflect the period prior to the increase in fertilizer&#13;
prices and the latter to reflect these price increases) for various&#13;
crops and craphed these. Surprisingly, the ratios did not change&#13;
significantly, for the increase in nutrient prices (nearly threefold&#13;
in India) was offset by increases in the prices of major foodgrains. 3/&#13;
Next we obtained the current level of nutrient use (nitrogen&#13;
only) on smlall farms (those between 0-2.5 hectares) and located this&#13;
on the response curve (denoted S - similarly nitrogen use on medium&#13;
and large farms is marked M and L). With these data in hand we&#13;
could estimate the following:&#13;
- The base or control yield, i.e., the yield with zero&#13;
ferti-ization (marked A);&#13;
- the maximum agronomic yield (C on the graph);&#13;
- the yield at current levels of nitrogen use on small&#13;
farms (B); and&#13;
- the yields at economically optimum input levels at 1967-72&#13;
and 1972-74 average nutrient/output price ratios (D and E&#13;
respectively).&#13;
1/ The data were insufficient to allow us to plot yield response&#13;
to total NPK use in a single quadrant. We chose nitrogen&#13;
because it gives the highest response surface for food crops and&#13;
because it represents nearly 70-90% of all nutrient use in the&#13;
case of most crops under unirrigated and irrigated conditions.&#13;
See Annex II.&#13;
2/ Recognizing the problem of enormous variability from one agro-&#13;
nomic zone to another in such a large country we avoided both&#13;
those data that gave very high (or dominant) responses as well&#13;
as those that gave very low responses for similar varieties and&#13;
conditions of irrigation. Rainfall and weather effects however&#13;
were only partially controlled by the data which were all for the&#13;
same year. See Indian Statistical Institute (1974).&#13;

These estimates are shown in Table 4.4 for various foodcrop&#13;
varieties under irrigated and unirrigated conditions0   The    esti-&#13;
mates clearly show how far small farmers have already come in&#13;
obtaining yield increases from increaGed nutrient use and how rnuch&#13;
further they can go.     We  can  now   clearly  distinguish&#13;
the various '"yield gaps" and "potentials" that are often loose'ky&#13;
dagined&amp; uzig the following categorios:&#13;
- the maximum agronomic potential QC-A): this is the&#13;
di2l2erence between yields at zero levels o2 nitrogen use and the&#13;
manimum yieldas that could be achieved physiTally, without any&#13;
regerence tae economic profitability. By this definition yIied&#13;
increases ranging from 30-1309 could be achieved eses Table 4.5).&#13;
But although these are often used to suggest small farmer potential&#13;
(for example as shown in Section 3A above), they are essentially-&#13;
irrelevant to the problem.&#13;
- the maximum economic potential JD-A) or (E-A): this is&#13;
the difference between yields at zero levels of nitrogen use and&#13;
the yields at economically optimum levels. By this definition&#13;
much lower yield increases, of between 20-75%, could be achieved.&#13;
But this is a potential that exists only for the unfertilized&#13;
proportion of the gross cultivated area. The unfertilized-pro-&#13;
portion on small farms varied depending on the crop, variety and&#13;
irrigation, but as we have shown only 10-20% of the irrigated and&#13;
unirrigated area under HYVs falls in this category. A much larger&#13;
proportion of unfertilized area (50-70%) is devoted to traditional&#13;
irrigated varieties, and in this category the economic potential&#13;
for wheat, maize and even paddy is considerably higher (30-130%)&#13;
than for HYVs. This undoubtedly reflects the fact that HYVs offered&#13;
a higher return and the first available supplies of fertilizers&#13;
are devoted to them. But the fertilization of local varieties&#13;
offers cons-iderably more promise now that HYVs are already being&#13;
fertilized more heavily. Only some 5-30% of the area under unirri-&#13;
gated local varieties is being fertilized, but apart from maize&#13;
fertilization of these crops does not offer much of an economic&#13;
potential. In rain-fed conditions fertilization of maize could&#13;
increase yields nearly 92% profitably if it is not at present&#13;
being fertilized.&#13;
- the current economic potential (D-B) or (E-B): this is the&#13;
difference between yields at current levels of nitrogen use arid the&#13;
yields at economically optimum levels.   This is the relevant figure&#13;
for the large proportion of the areas already being fertilized by&#13;
small farmers. The potential gains from increased fertilizer&#13;
application are relatively small (5-20%, except for local wheaet&#13;
with 70%) for India. For Bangladesh, however the potential is&#13;

still fairly large (50-60) e this partly reflects the lower level&#13;
of nutrient use in Bangladesh, but the data are too unreliable to&#13;
say anything with certainty.&#13;
Finally.all these potential yield increases do not imply net&#13;
increases in small farmer incomes of the same magnitude -- the cost&#13;
of additional nutrients (even assuming no outlaya for additional&#13;
labor and pesticide) has to be netted out0 Th@oe net income increases&#13;
are calculated in two stages:&#13;
- Stage I: When moving from zero to current levels of&#13;
nitrogen use (from A to B) e and&#13;
- Stage II: When moving from current to optimum levels&#13;
of nitrogen use (B to D or E).&#13;
The second stage potential applies only to the fertilized&#13;
proportion of the area while the sum of the first and second stage&#13;
income increases applies to the unfertilized proportions. These&#13;
calculations are shown in Tables 4.6 and 4.7.&#13;
A general idea of the magniture of potential farm income&#13;
increases at the two stages can be obtained by taking the 1973-74&#13;
average yields under irrigated and unirrigated conditions and&#13;
evaluating these outputs at the same prices at which the net income&#13;
increases per hectare were calculated0 We compare the two in&#13;
Table 4.8, where these net income increases obtainable from nitrogen&#13;
use are taken as a percentage of the groos farm income per hectare&#13;
obtained at 1973-74 yield levels. 1/&#13;
1/ The actual percentage increases would be somewhat higher&#13;
because net farm incomes are smaller than gross incomes by&#13;
a factor representing the other costs of production0 But&#13;
this is probably offset by the fact that all small farm house-&#13;
hold incomes are not derived from farming0 Farmers with less&#13;
than one hectare earned only about 40 of their incomes from&#13;
crop production. The rest was equally divided between agri-&#13;
cultural wages and other sources (NCAER: Changes in Rural&#13;
Income in India, 1975, pgs. 78-79.)&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In India these income increases are in the 35-65% range&#13;
(sum of A to B and B to D) under irrigated conditions on areas&#13;
not yet fertilized. Where fertilizers are already being usea&#13;
uncer irrigated conditions these increases are far lower - 10-25t.&#13;
The economic potential under unirriqated conditions is so low as to&#13;
be non-existent (except for local varieties of maize) with.n the&#13;
margin of error. The critical role of controlled water is clearly&#13;
established. Without irrigation small farmers in rainfed areas&#13;
(some of the poorest regions in Eastern and Central India) cannot be&#13;
expected to increase their incomes even with new varieties and&#13;
extensive fertilization unless of course new adaptive research in&#13;
drought-resistant crops yields somne breakthroughs. In order to&#13;
bring these farmers any hope irrigation niust be the first priority&#13;
for them. Without water they will be permanently shut off from the&#13;
new technologies and input-oriented strategies will bypass them.&#13;
In Bangladesh we have data only on irrigated rice and here&#13;
the income increases are substantial -- 70-120% for those areas&#13;
not yet fertilized and 60-95% for areas already under fertilizer.&#13;
This reflects the lower level of present nitrogen use in Ban,gladesh.&#13;
We have tried in this section to establish the potential&#13;
income increases that could accrue to small farmers if input-&#13;
intensive strategies were vigorously pursued. Several caveats&#13;
ought to be kept in mind:&#13;
- The data do not allow anything more than a statement of&#13;
the broad magnitudes and their direction. Enormous&#13;
variability in resource endowments, soils, climiate,&#13;
yield-response relationships that are always specific&#13;
to place and often to time prevent any other generaliza-&#13;
tions for a sub-continent that is so vast.&#13;
- These magnitudes only establish potentials. Whether or&#13;
not small farmers will actually obtain these income&#13;
increases will'bepend upon a host of other factors&#13;
including most importantly (i) their real access to the&#13;
inputs (a problem we discuss next), (ii) the agrarian&#13;
structure within which they are imbedded and (iii) their&#13;
control over and participation in local institutions that&#13;
determine the distribution of benefits.&#13;
Finally, will these yield and income increases,if reaLized,&#13;
make any difference to the overall growth of the agricultural&#13;
sector? From the meager evidence for India we have tried to&#13;
calculate the value of farm production by famnsize (Table 4.9).&#13;

Note: It is assumed that the area in holding size group 2 - 6, Ha&#13;
is 2/3 of the group 2 - 10 Ha (as in 1960-61). The other size&#13;
groups are as in the 1970-71 census.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
For what it is worth, we find that fams of less than two hectar- s&#13;
account for about 30% of the value of garm production although,&#13;
they account for only 21% of the operated area. (We cannot get&#13;
comparable figures for Bangladesh and Pakistan.) If small farm&#13;
output were to increase by 40-50% over a five year period, tilt!&#13;
annual aggregate growth rate of the agricultural sector would be&#13;
3t higher than it otherwise would be. If small farm output were&#13;
to increase by 40-50% over ten years the rate of agricultural&#13;
growth would be only 1.5% higher per year than it otherwise would be.&#13;
C. Irrigation&#13;
From all that has been said in previous sections, it should&#13;
be evident that irrigation and controlled water management hold&#13;
the key to higher productivity increases in the agricultural sector&#13;
in South Asia. Increased irrigated area is essential to (i) increased&#13;
yields, because it allows one to shift to higher production functions;&#13;
(ii) increased cropping intensities, because without controlled water&#13;
proper management of complex cropping systems is unlikely; (iii) the&#13;
adoption of high yielding varieties which have been adapted mainly&#13;
to irrigated conditions; (iv) decreased variations in yields, because&#13;
it reduces the dependence on weather and monsoons; and (v) increased&#13;
use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, to which crops are more&#13;
responsive under irrigated conditions.&#13;
Generally, there is an inverse relationship between the size&#13;
of holding and the area under irrigation.    (See Tables 4.10 to 4.12.)&#13;
For example, while nearly 22% of the gross crop area is irrigated&#13;
on all farms in India, farms of less than 5 acres have 28% - :34%&#13;
of their area irrigated. This relationship is not so evident in&#13;
Pakistan. To begin with, a far higher percentage of the tota:L area&#13;
is irrigated (nearly 74% on all farms)and small farms do not irri-&#13;
gate a higher percentage (75% - 65 t of the total area is irrigated&#13;
on small   farms).   Finally, in Bangladesh a very small percentage&#13;
of the area is irrigated (6-7%) and there are no substantial differ-&#13;
ences between farms of various sizes.&#13;

Although small farms have a higher proportion of their cjross&#13;
cropped area irrigated, they do not account for most of the irrigated&#13;
area in India and Pakistan. In India farms of less than 5 acres&#13;
account for 22% of the total irrigated area (they account for 19%&#13;
of the cultivated area); in Pakistan for only 6% (5% of the cultivated&#13;
area). In Bangladesh the figures are much higher, nearly 50% of the&#13;
area irrigated (51% of the cultivated area). Further, tl .:e are no&#13;
significant differences in the sources of irrigation used by dif-&#13;
ferent sized farms, at least when the evidence available from India&#13;
is considered (Table 4.13).&#13;
These aggregate data simply show that small farmers irrigate&#13;
as much area (if not more,proportionally) as other farmers. They&#13;
give no clues to the intensity of water use; the timing of the&#13;
availability of water in farmers'fields; or the efficiency of water&#13;
use once it gets to the fields0 It is to these issues that the&#13;
problem of small farmer "access" is normally addressed.&#13;
The aggregate problem is, what is the unutilized irrigation&#13;
potential in the sub-continent and to what extent is the increased&#13;
irrigation going to be available to small farmers? There are two&#13;
kinds of irrigation to be considered:   surface irrigation, mainly&#13;
through canals, and groundwater irrigation through wells a:nd&#13;
tubewells. Government studies indicate that there is considerable&#13;
potential for increased irrigation from both these sources in South&#13;
Asia (see Table 4.14), conditional upon investment programs that&#13;
may or may not be undertaken0 Although there is substantial&#13;
potential for increased irrigation, both from surface and ground-&#13;
water sources, several factors may prevent small farmers from&#13;
getting access to it0&#13;
With surface irrigation the problems are those of:&#13;
- lack of investment funds to build farm-level tributaries and&#13;
proper field-level water courses and drainage systems. Old&#13;
style irrigation projects that left the development of secon-&#13;
dary and tertiary systems to local authorities may have&#13;
unwittingly biased the development of surface irrigation&#13;
in favor of larger and better-off farmers;&#13;
- lack of access and control over water flows, to the extent&#13;
that small farmers are located further down the water distribu-&#13;
tion network and lack the ability to get canal water released&#13;
when they need it. Since timing is critical, especially in&#13;
periods of drought or months of low precipitation, small&#13;
farmers suffer the most from having to come last in line to&#13;
receive scarce water resources0 Rationing during periods of&#13;
scarcity is likely to benefit those who know the local&#13;
authorities;&#13;

- lack of access to credit to finance long-term on-farm&#13;
investmients such as water courses, drainage systems and&#13;
wells. This is a special problem for those sharecroppers&#13;
and tenants who lack clear title to the land they farm.&#13;
The exclusive use of land ana assets as a lien for long-&#13;
term loans is especially biased against these groups&#13;
because it is precisely the asset that they do not have;&#13;
- cos ts,  as reflected in the water rates. Although these&#13;
are not discriminatory, they can be prohibitive to the small&#13;
farmer with few cash assets. Subsidizing water rates for&#13;
small farmers is one solution but is difficult to administer&#13;
eas:ily.&#13;
With croundwater irrigation the problems are:&#13;
- lack; of investment funds to sink deep wells or put in tubewells&#13;
and the lack of medium- and lonq-term credit to make this&#13;
possible;&#13;
- economies of scale that militate against the use of private&#13;
tubewells on fragmented and small holdings. An alternative&#13;
is to organize groups of farmers to overcome the scale problem.&#13;
But organization of irrigation cooperatives suffers from the&#13;
same problem as other cooperative efforts-the larger and better-&#13;
off farmers end up getting most of the benefits and the control&#13;
of the system;&#13;
- lack of control over public wells and tubewells. To the extent&#13;
that small and tenant holders belong to lower castes there is a&#13;
definite bias against them in the use of existing deep well faci-&#13;
lities. Public tubewell schemes used to overcome the problems&#13;
of lumpy investments have similarly been subverted to the bene-&#13;
fit (of larger holders;&#13;
- fragrnentation of holdings,which prevents groundwater irrigation&#13;
from being used to its best advantage. 1/&#13;
1/ In IndiaL this is a problem that has been frequently cited as a&#13;
major baLrrier to the proper development of well irrigation.&#13;
Legislation for the consolidation of holdings exists in most&#13;
states but only Punjab, Haryana and U.P. have begun consolidation,&#13;
and only 89 million acres have been consolidated (20% of cropped&#13;
area).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Where holdings are fragmented, -a spixit of cooperation betweeL±&#13;
neighboring farms is essential if ve11X are to be sunk,   How Large&#13;
the minimum economic farm size is for irrigation by wells dependa&#13;
on how the water is shared among faregrs. I/   Alternatively, - 4 &#13;
operators of large    fragments may install wells and sell water&#13;
to their neighbors, a solution that again places larger farmers&#13;
in control of the scarce water.&#13;
Although, as Tables 4.15-17 show,zmall farms are general:Ly made&#13;
up of fewer parcels than larger farms, the problem of fragmentation&#13;
is nonetheless critical when it comes to the installation of wells&#13;
and tubewells, for the few investable funds that could be borrowed&#13;
cannot be used effectively over the average number of 2 - 6 parcels&#13;
per holding that small farmers have. Although other diseconomies&#13;
and inefficiencies are also associated with fragmentation of holdings,&#13;
the barriers it presents to the effective use of groundwater water&#13;
resources are almost crippling to a small farmer.&#13;
One can thus conclude that smallholders are likely to get even&#13;
less than their proportionate share of the increased irrigation in&#13;
the decade to come. Furthermore, there are severe problems associated&#13;
with the further development of both surface and groundweter irriga-&#13;
tion systems. In Tndia, for example, the lag between the creation&#13;
of irrigation systems and their actual use is a serious concern, as&#13;
unutilized potential has been rising. The Government is undertaking&#13;
command area development (defined below). The funding of such exten-&#13;
sive programs has been one of the problems, but the real constraint&#13;
has been the time required to build the institutional framework and&#13;
administrative capacity to implement the highly complex components&#13;
of command area development (CAD) schemes. The area potentially&#13;
irrigable from existing facilities is estimated to be 2.5 million&#13;
hectares by the end of the Fifth Plan. In relation to the extent&#13;
of the task, coverage by CAD projects had been modestg not more&#13;
than 100,000 hectares have been covered so far. Although plans&#13;
for further coverage are ambitious in India, considering the low&#13;
starting point CAD cannot be expected to have a major impact on&#13;
the gap between the potential created and its actual utilization&#13;
for a long time.&#13;

Another feature of the large and medium size irrigation systems&#13;
in India has attracted attention. This is the need to upgrade the&#13;
standards of design and operation of surface schemes to use India's&#13;
scarce water resources more efficiently. High yielding varieties,&#13;
because of their greater potential and quicker maturity. ;-e more&#13;
subject to water stress than traditional varieties. They require&#13;
more water, and within more narrowly restricted periods0 Host of&#13;
the irrigation systems built over the last 200 years were designed&#13;
mainly to deliver relatively small supplements to rainfall over a&#13;
wide area in order to protect the crops from breaks in the monsoon0&#13;
The systems generally lacked controlled structures to deliver water&#13;
selectively when required by the crops, especially down-field0 Fur-&#13;
thermore, conveyance utilization efficiencies--the proportion of the&#13;
water entering the system that is beneficially used--are gen,rally&#13;
very low0&#13;
Recognition of some of these problems has led to a major change&#13;
in the strategies regarding the development of surface irrigation in&#13;
India. Most of the earlier financing and schemes were confined to&#13;
major engineering works, with no funds for associated agricultural&#13;
development0 In most projects which incorporated work to strengthen&#13;
agricultural extension services or on-farm developments, these fea-&#13;
tures were largely ignored in practice0 The lesson learned from these&#13;
earlier projects was that construction of irrigation infrastructure&#13;
alone had little agricultural impact0 There was a need to focus more&#13;
on integration of irrigation and agriculture to achieve better water&#13;
use and to enable the anticipated benefits from projects to be realized&#13;
more rapidly. This led in the early 1970s to the idea of command area&#13;
development (CAD) which comprises the construction of field channels&#13;
and drains, land levelling and shaping to ensure effective and reliable&#13;
water supply at the farm level. Some of the larger projects now in-&#13;
volve 100,000 or more farmers each of whom has to be dealt with&#13;
individually. Before the actual work of land development can begin,&#13;
the land records of every farmer must be updated, farm boundaries&#13;
established, the land surveyed and development plans prepared for&#13;
loans from land development or commercial banks. As universal par-&#13;
ticipation is essential, and if a farmer's creditworthiness is in&#13;
doubt, special arrangements must be made for financing from outside&#13;
normal credit channels. These are especially necessary for the&#13;
smaller farmers included in these schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
The World Bank's experience with CAD has been mixed. The&#13;
Rajasthan Canal project, which also included a component for re-&#13;
organization of extension services, was eminently successful.    It&#13;
is, however, atypical in that it is also a settlement project, and&#13;
hence involved no problems of land records and credit. In the&#13;
Chambal projects, in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, despite emphasis&#13;
on organization arrangements, progress with CAD has been pitifully&#13;
slow for reasons associated with land tenure.&#13;
Because of the slow progress it was realized that if irrigation&#13;
development were to continue on a project-by-project basis, a signi-&#13;
ficant program of on-farm works would never be implemented, particu-&#13;
larly in view of the estimated backlog of 10 million hectares needing&#13;
such works. To sj_ed development it was decided to approach the prob-&#13;
Lem on a state-by-state basis.    The solutions to organizational,&#13;
administrative, financial and legal problems associated with land&#13;
development were thought to be replicable across states. This is&#13;
the basis of the approach being taken by such agencies as the Bank today.&#13;
Apart from the breakthrough on the state-by-state appoach, the&#13;
';e:ond major development has been to improve water use through better&#13;
engineering design and to finance all works except land levelling from&#13;
budgetary sources, thus bypassing credit institutions and ending the&#13;
need for clear land titles. The main remaining problems are those&#13;
associated with cost recovery, either through raising water charges&#13;
or by passing the budgetary portion to credit institutions for&#13;
refinancing.&#13;
To what extent have small farmers benefitted from surface&#13;
irrigation, CAD or otherwise, in India? Project areas for surface&#13;
irrigation hitherto have been selected mainly on technical grounds&#13;
with preference given to low rainfall and drought-prone areas.&#13;
These areas tend to have larger but very poor farms with considerable&#13;
potential wh(en irrigated. Traditionally larger farmers, and parti-&#13;
cularly farmers at the head of a water course, have benefitted most.&#13;
By bringing water down to each farm and financing this development&#13;
from budgetary sources rather than by credit, it is expected to&#13;
ensure small farmer participation. 1/&#13;
However, to the extent that surface irrigation requires invest-&#13;
ment in the development of field channels and to the extent that&#13;
such investment requires valid and well-known land titles, both&#13;
1/ For example, in the recent Orissa Irrigation project, 75% of the&#13;
projected 30,000 benefitting farm families own less than 5 acres.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
small farmers, because they lack the credit, and tenants, because&#13;
they in addition have no clear title to the land, stand to gain&#13;
little. The inability of current organizational structures to&#13;
deliver water from developed irrigation sources to small and&#13;
tenant farmers is well known. But what organizational reforms&#13;
are needed to solve these problems is not known.&#13;
Similarly, enormous problems exist in the development of&#13;
groundwater potential. The major force in land irrigation develop-&#13;
ment in India has been private investment in openwells and tubewells.&#13;
The number of openwells rose from about 3.6 million in 1956 to about&#13;
6.1 million in 1971, 1/ and tubewells also proliferated very rapidly&#13;
in the wake of the new technologies. A private tubewell provicles&#13;
the cultivator with the command over his irrigation source from&#13;
which he can water his crops at the right time and with the required&#13;
quantity--freedom of choice which is of immense value.&#13;
In India at the end of the Fourth Plan there were some 6.8&#13;
million wells in use and about 4.1 million diesel and electric pumps.&#13;
From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, this type of investment in&#13;
irrigation has added more to irrigated area than all the public&#13;
programs - major, medium and minor - combined. The Government's&#13;
role in this development has been indirect, mainly through the&#13;
provision of medium-term credit and rural electrification. 2/&#13;
1/   Report of the National Commission on Agriculture (1976), Part V,&#13;
Resource Development Government of India Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
and Irrigation, New Delhi, p. 18.&#13;
2/   Although not all investments in tubewell development have been&#13;
financed by institutional credit, estimates of flows of funds&#13;
through publicly-controlled agricultural credit institutions&#13;
tend to confirm that private tubewell development accelerated&#13;
from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. After that there was a&#13;
decline and only in recent years has it increased. The decline&#13;
after 1970-71 did not reflect any shift in public policy. In&#13;
fact it has been argued that agricultural credit institutions&#13;
have been further expanded and strengthened since the mid-1960s&#13;
and subsidies had been eliminated before private tubewell develop-&#13;
ment reached high rates of growth. The availability of credit&#13;
for tubewell development has not been a problem, rather it has&#13;
been the decreased demand for these funds on the part of the&#13;
farmers, But whether or not credit was a problem for small&#13;
farmers is not known,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
Most of the private tubewell development has so far occurred&#13;
in regions of India--mostly Punjab, Haryana, Western UP and Tamil&#13;
Nadu--where conditions were highly favorable for the adoption of&#13;
the seed-fertilizer-water technology in general and groundwater&#13;
development in particular. If private tubewell development is to&#13;
maintain its historical rates,the impetus must now come from other areas&#13;
The part of India which still has an untapped potential for&#13;
large scale groundwater development is the Eastern region comprising&#13;
West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Assam and Eastern UP. However, the eco-&#13;
nomic climaLte and institutional conditions in the Eastern region do&#13;
not provide as great an economic incentive for investment in tubewells.&#13;
Agriculturael practices are not highly productive, and are based on&#13;
traditional varieties of grain, mainly rice. Because existing rice&#13;
varieties aire not as widely adaptable and broadly pest-resistant as&#13;
the new wheat varieties, private investment in tubewells may be&#13;
limited. Eurthermore, as the area has heavier rainfall, the need&#13;
for irrigation is less obvious and the incremental benefits fewer.&#13;
Land holdings are much smaller on average so there are fewer farmers&#13;
for whom even the smallest private tubewell is a viable investment.&#13;
In addition, the public infrastructure in the Eastern region is&#13;
not as well developed. The area is not well covered by cooperative&#13;
or commercial credit institutions, with the result that, while funds&#13;
for tubewell financing may be available in lines of credit to the&#13;
state, there are fewer local institutions to channel such funds to&#13;
small farmers who will use them.    Moreover, rural electrification&#13;
is much less developed in the Eastern region than elsewhere. 1/&#13;
A recent innovation in Bihar is the low cost bamboo tubewell&#13;
which irrigates two to four hectares. A large number of these were&#13;
sunk in the districts of Purnea and Saharsa and are reported to have&#13;
given good performance for over four years. These tubewells are&#13;
operated with mobile diesel pumps, which are available on hire also.&#13;
For rapid exploitation of groundwater where shallow acquifers exist,&#13;
these low-cost tubewells hold great promise, but how extensively&#13;
they can be used is not known. 2/&#13;
1/   At the end of the Fourth Plan, 17% of the villages in the Eastern&#13;
region including UP had electricity, as compared to 37% in the&#13;
rest of India and 27% in Northern India.&#13;

Electric pumping sets are generally trouble-free, and cheap and&#13;
easy to operate, but due to the low voltage in many areas of I:ndi&#13;
they have not been used as effectively as -hey might.   D_       ,  I&#13;
have an advantage in that they can be conveniently moved from one&#13;
tubewell to another, thus saving capital costs. But the operatir.&#13;
cost per hour of diesel tubewells is nearly double that of electricua&#13;
operated ones.  The critical problem here is that access to electrici v&#13;
for farm use has also been disproportionately in favor of the largei&#13;
farmers.&#13;
Pakistan has similar problems. It has had irrigation systems&#13;
for centuries. Irrigation development in Pakistan has been dominated&#13;
by large infrastructure projects designed to transfer water from the&#13;
Western rivers to the Eastern rivers. These projects have used up&#13;
the limited funds for over a decade. More recently there has been&#13;
development of on-farm work,in particular improvements of water&#13;
courses to improve water-course delivery efficiency5, so that farmers&#13;
located at the tail end of water courses, generally the smaller farmers,&#13;
receive more reliable water supply.&#13;
In Bangladesh, prior to independence in 1971, the major emphasis&#13;
was on large-scale flood control and gravity irrigation projects.&#13;
These were costly and were a poor allocation of scarce resources.&#13;
Since independence there has been a shift from development of heavy&#13;
infrastructure to simple, low cost, quick-yielding minor irrigation&#13;
projects. The main emphasis in these newer projects is on low lift&#13;
pumps and tubewells.&#13;
Bangladesh is an exception in that it has pioneered different&#13;
organizational forms in irrigation and to a considerable degree its&#13;
groundwater has been reaching smaller farmers. Given the small size&#13;
of most holdings in Bangladesh, organization of farmer groups was a&#13;
necessity for the optimum use of minor irrigation facilities, typi-&#13;
cally covering 10 to 50 acres. Although in Bangladesh there are few&#13;
large farmers the relatively "better off" farmers tend to initiate&#13;
the formation of such groups and dominate their operations. Evidence&#13;
from the I.DoA. Northwest Tubewells project suggests this clearly,&#13;
though it also shows that small farmers have benefitted significantly.&#13;
To some extent domination of irrigation systems by larger, better off&#13;
farmers is inevitable, since these farmers "dominate the loca:L eco-&#13;
nomy, are the means of credit to the poorer sections, have some&#13;
education, have political influence with good connections at the&#13;
Union or Thana level and know how to pull strings to get things done:' 1/&#13;

Aspects of Tubewell Irrigation Projects:, (mimeo), 1977.&#13;
&#13;

In recent projects increasing emphasis has been placed on reaching&#13;
small farmers. In the Shallow Tubewells project, for a farmer's&#13;
group to be eligible for credit, "at least one-half of the proposed&#13;
irrigated area must belong to farmers whose total holdings are less&#13;
than three acres each." 1/ It is hoped that by ensuring the parti-&#13;
cipation ol small farms on a more equitable basis these projects will&#13;
help in arresting their gradually worsening economic status. It would&#13;
be unrealistic, however, to expect them, even if fully successful,&#13;
significantly to narrow the existing inequality among various segments&#13;
of the rural society or to solve the problems of access to increased&#13;
irrigation by small farmers.&#13;
Finally, the relationship between credit and access to ground-&#13;
water sources is well established. Because of scale economies,&#13;
tubewells are accessible to smallholders only if they purchase them&#13;
as a group. The Thana Irrigation Program in Bangladesh is the only&#13;
example of this sort of activity. The TIP begins with the formation&#13;
of a pump group which is encouraged to act as a cooperative, and can&#13;
expect to obtain credit to purchase tubewells. But Blair (1974) has&#13;
shown while a large proportion of the groups do become cooperatives,&#13;
only a small proportion of the members receive any loans. Possibly&#13;
a few men take advantage of the program by padding their membership&#13;
lists with non-existent group members. At least some of the groups&#13;
are composed of farmers in a quasi-tenant debt relationship to the&#13;
group manager. Further, because credit payments are made on the&#13;
basis of area irrigated, farmers have no incentive to use water&#13;
carefully. Though farmers are expected to assume all operating&#13;
costs of the pumps for a 5-year period, until recently their opera-&#13;
tions were subsidized; moreover, the distribution of pumps has&#13;
become "a distribution of favors."&#13;
Alam (1975) in looking at the deep tubewell irrigation schemes&#13;
in Bangladesh, found that the level of utilization of deep tubewells&#13;
was positively related to the availability of cooperative credit and&#13;
other inputs. The deep tubewells were rented to coop groups by the&#13;
Bangladesh Agricultural Development Cooperation. While membership&#13;
of the coop,erative groups came from all farm sizes, leadership rested&#13;
mainly with the medium and large farmers. Due to the fragmentation&#13;
of ownership holdings and lack of cohesiveness in the pump jroup,&#13;
the small farmers were not able to benefit. Myers (1972) quoting&#13;
a study by iAli Khan (1971) of a similar cooperative group trying to&#13;

greater indebtedness,and the larger the loan, the greater was the&#13;
percentage of loan default. He found that the proportion of loans&#13;
taken by management committee members (larger farmers!) was dispro-&#13;

loans.&#13;

To conclude, although irrigation water is essential to&#13;
increase small fanner productivityp and although the potential&#13;
for expanding irrigation is substantial, aevere problems remain&#13;
in assuming that small farmers will (get &amp;a larger share of this&#13;
increase than in the past. New organisational forms being designed&#13;
to increase small farmer access to both surface and groundwater&#13;
irrigation are still in their infancy, and their success is far&#13;
from assured0&#13;

Chapter V: INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS: PROBLEMS&#13;
OF ACCESS TO FACTOR AND PRODUCT MARKETS&#13;
There is a widespread feeling that small farmers would have&#13;
benefitted to a far greater extent from the new technologies had&#13;
they had better access to factor and product markets for essential&#13;
inputs. There are several areas in which small farmer access prob-&#13;
lems have been termed acute. The most important of these is credit.&#13;
A. Credit for Small Farmers&#13;
Credit is a key element in the modernization of agriculture and&#13;
has been treated as such for most small farmer development programs&#13;
around the world. 1/ Indeed, in some projects, among them IDA loans&#13;
to India and Pakistan, credit is the major focus. From the preceding&#13;
discussion it is evident that increased use of purchased inputs will&#13;
be necessary for small farmers. What role does credit play, and to&#13;
what extent is it a constraint for small farmers?&#13;
When we examine credit systems in South Asia, we observe that&#13;
small farmers (i) need credit more often; (ii) get less of it, at&#13;
least from institutional sources; (iii) usually as a result pay more&#13;
for it and (iv) find it a considerable constraint on their ability&#13;
to increase farm incomes further.&#13;
The most salient feature of the credit system in South Asia is&#13;
that institutional loans provide only a very small percentage of&#13;
total agricultural credit to the farming systems: non-institutional&#13;
sources provide 70% - 90% of all loans in the agricultural sector.&#13;
The "coverage" of the institutional sector is also low--only 5 - 20%&#13;
of all farmers receive institutional loans (Table 5.1). Most of the&#13;
institutional loans come from public sources (100% in Bangladesh and&#13;
Pakistan), while most of the non-institutional credit is "non-&#13;
commercial"--i.e., the rates and repayment terms are not clearly&#13;
known and are a matter of private arrangement. India differs from&#13;
Bangladesh and Pakistan both because commercial credit dorKnates&#13;
both the irLstitutional and non-institutional sector, and because&#13;
public institutions do not monopolize the institutional sector.&#13;
1/  There is an extensive literature on small farmer credit problems.&#13;
See for example Gordon Donald (1976) where the extensive work&#13;
prepared for the Spring Review on Small Farmer Credit Problems&#13;
by the US Agency for International Development is summarized.&#13;

Among the non-institutional sources of credit in South&#13;
Asia, the majority are moneylenders, traders, commission&#13;
agents,  friends and relatives    (Table 5.2).   In  Pakistan&#13;
the "friendis and relatives" category dominates all sources, while&#13;
in India and Pangladesh nearly 50% of all credits come from rural&#13;
moneylenders.&#13;
Small farmers rely even more heavily on non-institi.&#142; onal,&#13;
non-commercial sources (among whom the rural moneylenders and&#13;
relatives are the main suppliers) than farmers on the average. 1/&#13;
Second, although small farmers take a larger number of loans from&#13;
all sources--51% in India, 73% in Bangladesh but only 40% in Pakistan--&#13;
they account for a much smaller proportion of the total value of all&#13;
loans in the system--41% in India, 50% in Bangladesh and only 23% in&#13;
Pakistan (See Table 5.3). 2/ Third, small farmers pay much higher&#13;
interest rates for what credit they do get, because they are more&#13;
dependent on moneylenders. 3/ Moneylenders charge rates nearly&#13;
two and a half to three times as high as institutional sources--&#13;
at least if the available evidence from India is indicative of these&#13;
differences (see Table 5.4).&#13;
Finally, do small farmers have problems with regard to access&#13;
to credit? There are two views. The traditional view is that small&#13;
farmers do indeed have considerable access problems, which are a&#13;
major hindrance to their adoption of new technologies. Some evidence&#13;
has already been cited in Section 4A, but there is additional evi-&#13;
dence for this point of view. Abraham (1972) argues that the main&#13;
reason why special small farmer agencies were set up in India was&#13;
to remove the bias in institutional credit against small farmers. 4/&#13;
1/ See All India Rural Credit Survey, op. cit.&#13;
T/ The size classes used for this comparison differ from those in the&#13;
rest of this paper: small farms in Pakistan are here defined as&#13;
those of 0 - 10 acres (much larger than elsewhere in this paper);&#13;
small farms in Bangladesh are those of 0 - 3 acres (much smaller&#13;
than elsewhere in this paper.)&#13;
3/ There is little evidence on what interest rates are charged by&#13;
friends/relatives who are the other major source of credit. But&#13;
these rates are by no means negligible.&#13;
4/ The special agencies are the Small Farmer Development Agency&#13;
and the Marginal Farmer Agency. See Mavinkurve and Sundernathan&#13;
(1974) for an extensive discussion of the role of these agencies.&#13;

Although commercial banks have serviced the small farmers to a&#13;
greater degree after nationalization, the institutional agencies&#13;
have given most of their credit to medium and large land holdings.&#13;
Siince most small farmners are subsistence farmers, institutional&#13;
credit agencies have accepted the fact that until they raised fac&#13;
productivity over subsistence levels, loan repayments would remain&#13;
a problem. Similarly, Sen (1973) points out that although credit&#13;
from cooperative societies is supposedly available to large and&#13;
small farmers alike, loans are granted in proportion to the share-&#13;
capital purchased, so that even cooperatives set up for small farmers&#13;
in practice end up discriminating against them. An important: factor&#13;
that has prevented -redit from flowing to small farmers is the latters'&#13;
inability to particip.,te in the decision making of the cooperatives.&#13;
Large farmers have larger contributions per acre and get larger&#13;
c!edits per acre from the cooperative movement. Schluter (1973)&#13;
pointed out that cooperative credit became important in the adoption&#13;
of new technologies botlh because traditional credit sources were&#13;
unable to'unwilling tc expand to meet small farmer needs, and&#13;
because farners were unable to use traditional sources due to&#13;
the high risk in adoption of the new technologies.    The arrange-&#13;
ments for repayment to cooperatives have been considerably more&#13;
flexible than those of traditional sources, and have made farmers&#13;
more willing to take risks.&#13;
Rao (1970) in reviewing the evidence from the All-India Rural&#13;
Credit Survey showed that small farmers had higher indebtedness&#13;
than did large farmers. Further, that between 1962-63 and 1967-68&#13;
the percentage increase in credit taken by large farmers was far&#13;
greater than that taken by small farmers. Small farmers did get&#13;
a better deal from larger cooperative societies than from other&#13;
sources, but the prevailing high interest rates in the free market&#13;
gave greater incentives to large farmers who obtained credit from&#13;
cooperatives to re-lend their institutional borrowings to smaller&#13;
farmers. Larger farmers also cornered a larger share of the insti-&#13;
tutional credit, and hence actually shifted the burden of high&#13;
interest rates to the smaller farmers. Bhalla (1976), looking&#13;
at data from the All-India Debt and Investment Survey (1970--71),&#13;
found that small farmers had fewer assets to offer as collateral&#13;
and a smaller discretionary income. He found data to support the&#13;
assertion that as farm size increased, the cost of capital&#13;
declined.    Further, institutional sources   were  heavily biased&#13;
towards HYV users, who were considered a better risk. The&#13;
entire fund loans for fertilizer for HYV use were made available&#13;
at low interest rates. Further, access to institutional criedit&#13;
greatly diminished the cost of credit for small farmers. Further&#13;
evidence on problems of access to credit and the consequences of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
small farmer productivity increases has also been cited in studies&#13;
by Wills (L972) in UP, Raj Purohit (1972) in Mysore, and Frankel&#13;
(1971) in the Punjab.&#13;
Similar problems have been cited by Gotsch (1971) for Pakistan.&#13;
He found that the failure of the cooperatives in Pakistan was due&#13;
to the takeover by large farmers, the use of funds to finance more&#13;
lucrative ventures in the towns, the failure to provide any kind of&#13;
business management at the local level and the inability to recover&#13;
outstandinq debts. In another study Gotsch (1973) found that most&#13;
programs aimed at improving the capital markets faced by small far-&#13;
mers have left the majority of the small farmers untouched. Even&#13;
where there has been a willingness to absorb the cost of small far-&#13;
mer credit programs, creating local institutions which are respon-&#13;
sive to the weaker sections of the farming community, it has been&#13;
exceedingly difficult. He found that the direct distribution of&#13;
government-subsidized credit invited extra-market activities by&#13;
the socially and politically powerful aimed at securing available&#13;
funds for themselves. Where credit was indirectly disbursed through&#13;
organizations made up of farmer representatives, due to the dis-&#13;
parity of power even credit programs aimed expressly at the small&#13;
farmer were unsuccessftl.&#13;
Khan (1975), citing similar evidence from Pakistan, showed&#13;
that the percentage of farmers reporting debt,as well as the per-&#13;
centage of farmers taking loans for production, rose as farm in-&#13;
comes increased. He reports that institutional loans (Agriculture&#13;
Development Bank of Pakistan, Taccavi and cooperatives) have mostly&#13;
gone to farmers holding over 25 acres, while most small farmers&#13;
and the landless depend on friends and relatives for credit.&#13;
Finally, he concludes that access to the gains from the new&#13;
technologies was biased in favor of large, commercialized farmers&#13;
at the expense of subsistence farmers, because the former were&#13;
able to get the credit to purchase the appropriate inputs. Amjad&#13;
(1972) also points out that government credit has been extended&#13;
mainly to large farmers because small farmers have not been able&#13;
to provide the security for the loans. When he examined the data&#13;
from the ADBP for 1970-71, he found that the landless got 5.5% of&#13;
all loans from this institution, while farmers with between one&#13;
and three acres got less than half a percent; farmers with between&#13;
three and twelve acres received 7.6%; and those with land holdings&#13;
greater than twelve acres received 86%. Further, he found that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
100 &#13;
small farmers faced difficulties in obtaining fertilizers and&#13;
seeds because they had no way to pay the premium prices during&#13;
the sowing season for these inputs. 1/&#13;
Similar evidence can be cited for Bangladesh. Bose (1974)&#13;
in examining the Comilla cooperatives, found that large farmers&#13;
got disproportionately large shares of credit even though they&#13;
defaulted more than other farmers. 'Better-off' farmers used&#13;
cooperative loans at times to buy and lease land rather than&#13;
for the production purposes for which the loans were taken. In&#13;
Bangladesh even though the cooperative movement has allowed&#13;
the small farmer to wield more economic and political power,&#13;
the cooperatives have not yet become the "trade unions of the&#13;
small farmers" as was at first envisaged. Bose felt that in&#13;
spite of the hope placed in small farmer cooperatives the&#13;
evidence did not suggest that a replication of the Comilla&#13;
model with regard to cooperative credit would ensure the dif-&#13;
fusion of agricultu,ral technology with a fairly equal distribu-&#13;
tion of benefits. Similarly, Rochin (1973) indicated that credit&#13;
was insufficient and that farmers in Bangladesh useC credit for&#13;
personal consumption rather than production purposes0 Faidley&#13;
and Esmay (1976) similarly state that the cooperative policy&#13;
for loans in Comilla excluded those owning less than one acre&#13;
from getting any loans0 Cooperative members came mainly from&#13;
farms larger than one acre. Further, since the operation of&#13;
tubewells and pumps was controlled by cooperative members, they&#13;
have been able to irrigate a larger proportion of their farm&#13;
land than non-members who happen to be those with less thaLn one&#13;
acre and the landless0&#13;
Credit and Technology&#13;
How does one reconcile this litany of small farmer credit&#13;
woes with the extensive evidence on the adoption of new tech-&#13;
nologies by small farmers? Obviously small farmers must have&#13;
been able to get the cash-credit resources from somewhere in&#13;
order to purchase the non-farm inputs they have used.&#13;
1/  An interesting feature of both the Pakistan and Indian data&#13;
is that the lack of credit does not appear to be a binding&#13;
constraint in the early phases of the adoption of new tech-&#13;
nologies. Both Roc.h.in (1971) and Lowdermilk (1972) found&#13;
that credit was not a major barrier to the adoption of new&#13;
technologies in Pakistan. However, once the new technologies&#13;
and their adoption take off, credit becomes a major constraint.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
Thc: answer is two-fold:  first, small farmers have turned&#13;
to D iher than traditional sources (moneylenders and friends/&#13;
rWiativus) for their increased credit needs and second,with the&#13;
adx'ent of ncw technologies, traditional as well as non-traditional&#13;
sources hive been more willing to provide the credit needs of&#13;
-mall farmers once they adopt new technologies.    Thus, although&#13;
rew technologies have increased the demand for credit by small&#13;
'irmers, the supply has also increased considerably.&#13;
Trhe most recent data for India reviewed by Bhalla (1976)&#13;
seem to suggest that with the advent of new technologies,&#13;
f1 armers have increasingly obtained institutional credits&#13;
'see Tables 5.5(a) and 5.5(b)). Over 81% of all government loans&#13;
and 62% of all cooperative loans go to HYV farmers. The bulk&#13;
of loans from commercial banks and moneylenders go to non-HYV&#13;
fdrmers.  Whereas non-HYV small farmers account for only 9%&#13;
of covernment and 33% of moneylender loans, HYV small farmers&#13;
account for 17% and only 8% respectively from these two sources.&#13;
The proport:ion of small farmer loans extended by cooperatives&#13;
and friends/relatives mha's not changed significantly in response&#13;
to changincg technologies.&#13;
As Table 5.5b shows, Bhalla found the differences in the&#13;
cost of credit to HlYV and non-HYV farmers to be most pronounced&#13;
for small farmers: among small farmers, HYV growers on the&#13;
averaq.e paid 14% interest, non-HYV growers nearly 19% interest.&#13;
In Pakistan Lowdermilk (1972) showed that although the&#13;
majority of-small farmers reported that shortage of funds was&#13;
a major constraint on nutrient use, this constraint seems to&#13;
be felt less the higher the mean level of nutrient use.(See&#13;
Table 5.6.)&#13;
The evidence suggests that credit alone is not enough:&#13;
where income-increasing technologies are not available, credit&#13;
cannot solve the problem, nor is it a problem in itself. The&#13;
small farmer, as well as his creditors, must perceive new tech-&#13;
nologies or management systems to be profitable before he can&#13;
make good use of credit. Actually, several factors interact--&#13;
technology, product markets and availability of supply--in&#13;
determining whether opportunities are profitable for small&#13;
farmers.&#13;
First, new technologies must offer increases over present&#13;
yields large enough to persuade risk-averse small farmers to&#13;

duced, the technology must offer an input/output price ratio&#13;
of comparable appeal. In South Asia technologies meeting these&#13;
conditions are available, and small farmers are deriving consi-&#13;
derable advantage by adopting them rapidly0&#13;
Second, the market has to offer the small farmer substantial&#13;
returns to investing borrowed capital. He will be concerned both&#13;
with relative price levels and with the risks and uncertainties&#13;
of price changes in the market. As substantial numbers of small&#13;
farmers in South Asia have adopted new technologies, one can, con-&#13;
clude that the relative prices of inputs and products as perceived&#13;
by them and discounted for risks have been favorable to this adoption0&#13;
Since prices and yields both affect profits, and therefore the suc-&#13;
cess of credit programs, higher crop prices can compensate the&#13;
farmer for lower yields0  Therefore, a choice between administered&#13;
pricing and new technology appears to be always present in South&#13;
Asia.  Where new technologies are available, in the long run it&#13;
is better to base income increases on a technology strategy rather&#13;
than on a pricing one0&#13;
Third, shortages of inputs at critical times can ruin any credit&#13;
program0 -In most cases, however, the supply problem is less impor-&#13;
tant than the other two--technology and markets--because it is&#13;
better understood and more easily controlled0&#13;
Fourth, although there is some controversy about whether or&#13;
not small farmers typically have high delinquency and defauLt&#13;
rates on loans, it is clear that where these rates have been high,&#13;
the main reason has been low yields and cash returns generated by&#13;
the available technologies. 1/ We do not have enough evidence to&#13;
i/  The evidence fails to diseinguish between three different types&#13;
of credit: (a) a direct income transfer through debt write-offs&#13;
or subsidized interest to increase small farmer welfare, (b)&#13;
credit for consumption purposes and (c) production credit0&#13;
Some credit programs begin with the assumption that no increase&#13;
in production is to be expected from the provision of credit.&#13;
This is using credit as an income transfer here default rates&#13;
can be expected to be high, and are. Credit for consumption&#13;
poses more difficult problems because in the farm-household&#13;
context, it cannot be easily separatedfrom production credits0&#13;
Credit provided ostensibly for production can replace the&#13;
farmer's own resourco which in turn can be used for consumption.&#13;
In small scale subsistence agriculture this poses problems of&#13;
delinquency and default of a nature significantly different&#13;
from pure default on a production loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
know whether with the advent of new technologies, delinquency and&#13;
default rates have declined among small or other farmers, but the&#13;
presumption is that they must be declining in South Asia.&#13;
Fifth, where market incentives to adopt new technologies are&#13;
strong, most small farmers are able to finance some of their&#13;
needs without resorting to credit. This is especially true of&#13;
the seed-fertilizer packages which require no single large outlay.&#13;
The absence of medium- and long-term credit, however, is probably&#13;
still an inhibiting factor to the widespread and rapid adoption of&#13;
farm equipment and land improvements. Some improvements, for&#13;
example waiter pumps, will be more than they can manage to finance&#13;
by themselves. What investments small farmers are able to finance&#13;
depends very much on the technology being used, for as their&#13;
incomes rise they increasingly purchase market inputs.&#13;
Sixth, the private credit systems, informal and formal, have&#13;
met the moclest demand for credit generated by small farmers,&#13;
especially in the first phase of the adoption process. But&#13;
these systems generally tend to have relatively inelastic supplies.&#13;
Exclusive reliance upon the informal sector, without complementary&#13;
public sources of credit, will almost certainly retard the wider&#13;
spread of new technologies. When profitable opportunities for&#13;
investment appear, private sources of credit tend to concentrate,&#13;
but usually at interest rates so high as to discourage small&#13;
farmers frc,m borrowing. Public and institutional sources then&#13;
become essential and partly displace private funds. Notwithstanding&#13;
the sufficiency of private sources of credit to finance some form&#13;
of small farmer progress, it is important for institutional credit&#13;
to provide funds in order to compete with the system and break the&#13;
monopoly power of private lenders. Public credit is needed in this&#13;
case, not.to promote small farmer adoption, but to help with the&#13;
transformation of the rural economy.&#13;
This brings us to the traditional villains of the piece in&#13;
Emall farmer credit--the moneylenders. The private moneylenders&#13;
are often characterized as   exploiters , monopolists , extor-&#13;
tionists and the like, but they are still the most important&#13;
source of rural credit. Attempts to drive out or at least to&#13;
compete with non-institutional sources of credit, principally&#13;
for example by lowering interest rates, have not been particularly&#13;
successful. This suggests that credit officials tend to think&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
exclusively in terms of rates of interest, often overlooking other&#13;
credit traits essential for the farmere such as simple procedlurese&#13;
adequacy and timeliness. Obviously, informal sources of credlit,&#13;
though they charge higher interest rates, have better information&#13;
about their communities as well as providing better services.&#13;
Interest Rates and Interest Subsidies&#13;
A pure comparison of interest rates is not appropriate. Bottomly&#13;
(1963a, 1963b, 1964a, 1964b, 1973) has argued consistently that&#13;
rural rates of interest have several component parts: the pure&#13;
interest rate; the administrative premium; the risk premium; and&#13;
the monopoly profit. He has argued that from the point of view of&#13;
the borrower, pure interest rates differ little between institutional&#13;
and non-institutional sources0 On the other hand, the administrative&#13;
premium and the risk premium in credit to small farmers is much higher0&#13;
Although some amount of monopoly profit remains, this monopo:Ly profit&#13;
is far less than has normally been argued0 He has further shown&#13;
that blanket attempts by governments to finance the status quo at&#13;
low rates of interest will not succeed0 What is actually needed is&#13;
a change in technology and a substantial reduction in risk premiums0&#13;
He has shown that it actually takes an increase in the demand for&#13;
productive loanable funds brought about by new technologies to&#13;
effect a lower rate of interest0 (Bottomly, 1973)o&#13;
Are interest rates too high for small farmers? The evidience&#13;
seems to suggest the opposite if small farmers can borrow at the&#13;
rates they do without serious defaults0&#13;
Should aaricultural credit be subsidized, especially in the&#13;
institutional sector? A major finding of the AID small farmer&#13;
credit review, on the contrary, was that if institutional interest&#13;
rates were raised from, say, the average current rate of 5% to&#13;
20%, there would be few losses in terms of program goals and some&#13;
major gains for small farmers0 1/ The traditional view in this&#13;
regard is that small farmers especially need subsidized credit and&#13;
low interest rates0 This argument of course rests on the view&#13;
that farmers are sensitive to changes in interest rates and that&#13;
low rates are necessary to induce them to use credit for productive&#13;
investments. This position must now be challenged from the evidence&#13;
available. Small farmers have been willing to invest when profitable&#13;

Small Farmer Credit, 1973.&#13;

opportunities are made available to them; they are also accustomed&#13;
to and undeterred by village rates set considerably higher. Thus&#13;
if rates were to shift upward within the range mentioned, ULicre&#13;
would be little cause for small farmers to withdraw from institu-&#13;
tional credit. It follows that the case for low interest rates&#13;
is unacceptable, except insofar as they promote borrowers' welfare.l/&#13;
Artificially low interest rates have other problems. They do&#13;
not cover operating expenses and result in portfolio losses for&#13;
credit institutions, and they are unable to cover the cost of tech-&#13;
nical supervision. Several authors have pointed out that low interest&#13;
rates jeopardize the financial integrity of credit institutions&#13;
and that they also encourage credit institutions to minimize losses&#13;
by concentrating on the more reliable, prosperous farmer, particularly&#13;
those with collateral. Thus, the bulk of the small farm sector is&#13;
excluded.&#13;
This case has been effectively argued by Adams (1972 and 1973)&#13;
who has stated that low interest rate policies offered to small&#13;
farmers are a great hoax and that they do small farmers more harm&#13;
than good. He insists that the rationalization of interest rates&#13;
is one of the most important policy reforms countries could under-&#13;
take in the field of small farmer finance. Further, he has argued&#13;
and evidence is available to show that financial savings may be&#13;
generated in the rural sector at rates much greater than commonly&#13;
thought, if interest rates were much higher. 2/ But to encourage&#13;
1/ There is often a distinction between the welfare or equity&#13;
objectives and the efficiency of production objectives in&#13;
credit programs. No one can deny that credit programs are&#13;
often set up for welfare objectives.   Further, governments&#13;
have a right to establish welfare objectives. No one can say&#13;
that consumption credit is not justified or that credit pro-&#13;
grams are not a convenient way of transferring income. The&#13;
real problem occurs with regard to the conflict between pro-&#13;
duction and welfare objectives within the same 2rogram. This&#13;
conflict often creates problems both for the effectiveness&#13;
of the program and for evaluating their success. Credit at&#13;
low interest rates in welfare or consumption credit type programs&#13;
must be seen as an income transfer.&#13;
2/  For evidence from the Republic of China, see Adams, Ong and&#13;
Singh (1975). For rural saving potentials in India, see&#13;
Bhalla (1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
savings governments must not only raise interest rates but&#13;
provide the legal basis and security for deposits, and help&#13;
develop physical facilities. Rural banks and provincial&#13;
branch banks offer such facilities. The ability of agriculture&#13;
to generate much of its own capital requirements is so importalnt,&#13;
in the long run, that governments should encourage credit insiti-&#13;
tutions which offer the savings facilities.&#13;
The arguments against raising i?terest rates stem first f:rom&#13;
the fact that the input and output commodity markets in which&#13;
small farmers operate often suffer from monopoly and other dis-&#13;
tortions, and their economic efficiency is unlikely to be improved&#13;
simply by correction of interest rates. Second, it is argued&#13;
that institutions must charge much lower rates than moneylenders&#13;
because the latter offer many more services; third, that the&#13;
hypothesized effect of high interest rates on the supply of&#13;
commercial credit and rural savings is still untested except&#13;
in a few countries; and finally, that governments, politicians,&#13;
farmers and others support low interest rates and, right or wrong,&#13;
their views are not likely to be easily overcome.&#13;
Subsidiw for small farmers can be justified on several grounds,&#13;
but it is a mistake to use the credit mechanism as a vehicle for&#13;
subsidy. The argument against subsidizing small farmers by dealing&#13;
gently with delinquency is that this permissiveness destroys the&#13;
discipline which is vital to institutional viability. There are&#13;
three reasons for subsidizing small farmers: (i) to redistribute&#13;
income to them from other sectors; (ii) to maintain subsisterLce&#13;
levels among extremely poor farmers, especially those with such&#13;
poor resources that improved access or even new technology would&#13;
not make their farms viable; (iii) to encourage production on&#13;
potentially viable farms, to encourage them to adopt new tech-&#13;
nologies. These are legitimate reasons, but it has been arguied&#13;
that the subsidy should be incorporated in the price of services&#13;
and supplies rather than in the price of credit. This is because&#13;
subsidizing credit distorts credit markets, leads to opportunity&#13;
costs way below what they truly are, and leads to large farmers&#13;
borrowing funds to invest in virtually useless enterprises.&#13;
However, subsidies to credit institutions do play a useful role&#13;
in covering institutional deficits, at least in the initial stages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
Credit and Risk&#13;
It is evident that risk is a significant factor in small&#13;
farmer decision-making, and creditors recognize this clearly.&#13;
It is well recognized that even the most illiterate farmers&#13;
place some probabilities on the outcome of their farming decisions,&#13;
and on future events outside their own experience. 1/ Since they&#13;
live at the margin of subsistence, they cannot accept risks which&#13;
might jeppardize their family survival. There is ample evidence&#13;
to indicate that increased farm investments will take place only&#13;
when risks are removed from the minds of farmers. 2/&#13;
Small farmers face a number of risks which can significantly&#13;
affect the extent to which they adopt new technologies and the&#13;
extent to which credit use becomes productive:&#13;
- Yield risk is probably the most serious risk faced by&#13;
small farmers. The new technologies consistently show&#13;
greater yield variations than do traditional methods.&#13;
Und,er adverse weather conditions where irrigation and&#13;
controlled water use are not available, the high yielding&#13;
varieties sometimes yield even less than the traditional&#13;
varieties. Under ideal conditions of course the yields&#13;
are often four to five times higher. There is an obvious&#13;
need to develop varieties which show less yield variability,&#13;
even at the expense of some reduction in average yields.&#13;
It iis a well known fact that farmers in South Asia,in&#13;
conditions of uncertain rainfall, keep a higher percentage&#13;
of t:heir crop area under drought-resistant crops or grow&#13;
crop mixtures. 3/ Further, farmers must also consider&#13;
the uncertainties of floods, insects, disease and even&#13;
wars, all of which might adversely affect the yields&#13;
obtatined in any given year. crop insurance programs&#13;
hold some promise for spreading the weather risks faced&#13;
by farmers, but these must be applied with great care.&#13;
The more successful credit programs normally provide&#13;
many technical packages to overcome local differences&#13;
in yields.&#13;
-   Price variability of inputs or products is also of concern&#13;
to the farmer. Input and product prices are exogenous&#13;
factors which fluctuate from year to year, yet the farmer&#13;
1/  See Wharton (1972), Roumasset (1976) and Anderson and Dillon (1977).&#13;
7/ Naidu (1964).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 &#13;
must predict specific values for each crop before th(e&#13;
crop season. Kahlon and Johl (1964) found that in the&#13;
Indian Punjab farmers varied acreages according to price&#13;
and yield variations, and that a risk fund was used to&#13;
meet the expected risks, the fund growing in size with&#13;
the use of new technologies. Government price guaran-&#13;
tees may help; price policies are also subject to change&#13;
even during the crop year, but they directly affect the&#13;
profitability of new technoloqies and are especiallv&#13;
needed for small farmers who are highly risk-averse.&#13;
The most successful credit programs have been supported&#13;
by price policies which reduce the input and product price&#13;
variability to the farmer.&#13;
Credit Institutions&#13;
Finally there are several "institutional factors" that present&#13;
problems of access to credit (or other inputs) for small farmers.&#13;
The most difficult to handle is the power structure in rural socie-&#13;
ties,that is so rigged against small farmer interests that credit&#13;
(or other) program objectives are likely to be frustrated,unless&#13;
the government is prepared to challenge that rural power. Gotsch&#13;
(1973) has made this point repeatedly and convincingly for Pakistan.&#13;
Another issue that seems to emerge is whether it is better to&#13;
establish special new institutions for small farmers (for example&#13;
the Small and Marginal Farmer Development Agencies in India) or to&#13;
reorient the existing financial structure to serve small farmer&#13;
needs. The evidence shows that the institutional form seems to&#13;
matter less than economic factors, especially those of technology&#13;
and farm-level profitability. 1/&#13;
An institutional problem, however, that is of some interest is&#13;
how one can handle a large number of small farmer clients and do it&#13;
cheaply. This capability depends upon administrative skills, low-&#13;
cost delivery, supervision and collection methods and access to a&#13;
large supply of funds. It is found that decentralized agencies&#13;
are better in this regard. Private cooperatives especially have&#13;
some outstanding features (which include local participation,&#13;
group sanctions against delinquency and multiplication of scarce&#13;
technical training). Cooperatives play a substantial role in&#13;
providing small farmer credit in South Asiai but face two severe&#13;
problems: the shortage of local managerial expertise and the&#13;
existing rural power structure. Although cooperative movements&#13;
1/  See E.B. Rice (1973), op. cit., Bose (1974), Schluter (1973),&#13;
Stepanek (1973), Solaiman and Haq (1973) and Tinnermeir and&#13;
Dowsell (1973).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ill -&#13;
have been extensively used especially in Bangladesh, the&#13;
common outcome is for the cooperative to be taken over by the&#13;
establishment and the small farmer interest to be partly or&#13;
completely abandoned. In the typical class-structured rural&#13;
societies of South Asia, cooperatives are a viLbl_&#13;
for small farmer progress only if governments are committed to&#13;
them.&#13;
Another proposal for reaching larger numbers of small farmers&#13;
is to let iprivate moneylenders continue to meet small farmer needs,&#13;
as they have in the past. The advantages of the moneylender in-&#13;
clude his low overhead and other administrative costs and a personal&#13;
familiarity with clients that can substantially reduce the rate of&#13;
default. rhe disadvantages include the predictable tendency of&#13;
these informal lenders to concentrate on the progressive small&#13;
farmers. The problem of giving additional power to those rural&#13;
classes is that the concentration of economic power in rural Asian&#13;
societies needs to be reduced. Although informal lending sources&#13;
will be around for a long time, it is useful for conventional&#13;
credit institutions to imitate their success by using their positive&#13;
features.&#13;
The arqument for government commitment toward cooperatives&#13;
actually applies to all forms of credit institutions. Since credit&#13;
programs by definition imply redistribution of economic and poli-&#13;
tical opportunity, they cannot succeed without confronting&#13;
existing rural power.&#13;
B. Marketing Problems&#13;
Small farmers have only a small surplus to market. This very&#13;
condition of "subsistence production" means that they need to&#13;
resort to output markets less frequently. Farm management studies&#13;
in India have shown that nearly 80-90% of total farm production on&#13;
farms less than 5 acres is kept for home consumption. 1/ Nonethe-&#13;
less, the evidence is clear that small farmers are welf integrated&#13;
into the local product and labor markets. The so-called "subsis-&#13;
tence farmer syndrome" where small farmers are isolated from local&#13;
factor and product markets and live "in subsistence and self-&#13;
sufficiency" just does not exist in South Asia. 2/&#13;
1/ See Studies in the Economics of Farm Management carried out in&#13;
various districts by Directorate of Economics and Statistics,&#13;
Ministry of Food and Agriculture,Delhi.&#13;
2/ See Lele (1971).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
Although marketing problems do exist they may not be signifi-&#13;
cantly different for small and large farmers. All farmers may&#13;
suffer from being tied to particular marketing channels due to&#13;
credit or other service obligations. Market effectiveness despends&#13;
critically on infrastructure and information, and the lack of&#13;
these makes rural markets inefficient and costly for all farnmers.&#13;
The small farnier's special handicap is his lack of credit or&#13;
cash income with which to buy non-farm inputs, as well as his small&#13;
marketable surplus. But the problem may be much larger than that:&#13;
although their marketable surplus is small, they do not necessarily&#13;
sell small amounts of their output in markets--their marketed sur-&#13;
lus is actually large. I/   Farm management and other studies show&#13;
that small farmers sell output in the post-harvest season only to&#13;
purchase the same commodities in the later pre-harvest months.&#13;
This means that although they may need to consume nearly all the&#13;
food they produce, they sell in the post-harvest months to meet&#13;
their cash obligations, only to purchase their food needs lacter,&#13;
normally at higher prices and usually with credit to tide them&#13;
over into the next post harvest period. 2/ Thus, they sell cheap&#13;
and buy dear.      So do other farmers but to a lesser degree.&#13;
Some of the solutions involve expanded on-farm storage faci-&#13;
lities, better support prices, an elimination of hoarding by&#13;
middlemen, improved access to institutional credit, and finally&#13;
the insurance of crops. Each of these solutions is equally&#13;
important for other farmers as well.&#13;
But what about the vaunted inefficiency of traditional marketing&#13;
systems and the concern that small farmers are often victims of a&#13;
special "marketing connection"? The villains of the "marketing&#13;
connection" are middlemen and so called petty traders, which&#13;
all governments in South Asia have castigated as exploiters and&#13;
hoarders . What little evidence we have on the working of market-&#13;
ing systems in South Asia does not support this image, at least in&#13;
India. 3/&#13;
1/  Marketable surplus is the difference between total annual&#13;
household consumption and farm output of a given commodlity and&#13;
can be negative if consumption exceeds sales. The marketed surplus&#13;
is the actual amount of farm output sold in markets over the pro-&#13;
duction year and must be either zero or positive.&#13;
2/  For example in the Indian Punjab small farmers marketed nearly 18%&#13;
of their wheat and 41% of their gram production only to repurchase&#13;
amounts equal to 23% of their wheat and 34% of their gram pro-&#13;
duction. Their marketable surplus (amount left of production&#13;
after netting out their consumption over the year) was -5% for&#13;
wheat and only 7% for gram. See H.N. Drivedi (1972), Gill and&#13;
Johl (1970) and Moore, Johl and Khusro (1973).&#13;
3/  That is,hard evidence as distinct from anecdotal evidence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The most extensive and detailed work in this area is by&#13;
Lele (1972, 1974, 1976). She states that the efficiency"&#13;
of marketing systems 1/ depends on (i) physical infrastructure;&#13;
(ii) financial institutions; (iii) communication network;(iv)&#13;
entrepreneurial and managerial manpower; in addition to the&#13;
mere contractual relationships between sellers and buyers.&#13;
Indeed the latter reflect the inadequacy of these elements&#13;
in local markets,leading to higher marketing costs. Traditional&#13;
marketing systems in subsistence agriculture typically suffer&#13;
from inadequate transport and storage facilities, lack of stan-&#13;
dardization in weights and measures, poor dissemination of market-&#13;
ing information, a large number of intermediaries, and inadequate&#13;
finance for trading. These factors are to the disadvantage of&#13;
all farmers, although small farmers are less able to bear the&#13;
higher marketing and transportation costs involved.&#13;
The popular view of traditional marketing systems is that&#13;
they do not operate efficiently and that large price spreads&#13;
and high profit margins are evidence of monopolistic tendencies&#13;
that especially victimize small farmers. Lele (1972) provides&#13;
extensive evidence to the contrary. She found that there are&#13;
too many intermediaries to permit monopolistic practices. Although&#13;
"strong bargaining positions" are enjoyed by some traders, profits&#13;
are usually limited by the large number of intermediaries. The&#13;
high profits earned by afew traders are due to their large scale&#13;
of operations or their command over capital--a scarce resource--&#13;
and these earnings are not monopolistic. Further, traders are&#13;
relatively skillful, and well informed about prices and demand&#13;
through their local contacts even though they lack good informa-&#13;
tion on overall stocks and supply conditions.&#13;
Further, although regional and intra-regional disparities in&#13;
output and input prices do exist and are often cited as conclusive&#13;
evidence of' monopoly returns, Lele found that prices of comparable&#13;
1/ An "efficient" marketing system is one that (i) provides a&#13;
timely supply of inputs, (ii) distributes seasonally produced&#13;
outputs; to processors and consumers at a minimum cost, (iii)&#13;
mobilizes market surpluses in the short run and (iv) integrates&#13;
local markets with national markets. See Lele (1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 °&#13;
varieties did not differ by more than the shipment costs. The&#13;
margins between primary and wholesale markets, which show marked&#13;
seasonality, can be attributed mainly to transport facilities at&#13;
the pre- and post-harvest periods. Price differences are then a&#13;
consequence of market imperfections and not of monopolistic&#13;
elements.&#13;
Finally, seasonal price variations also reflect real changes&#13;
in demand and supply-price conditions, with the costs of storage&#13;
being a major factor. In the case of foodgrains it is known that&#13;
as storage costs are often not covered by a rise in off-season&#13;
prices, traders prefer to turn their stocks over rapidly and cannot&#13;
capitalize on the full differences between the post-harvest low&#13;
purchase price and the pre-harvest high sale price as is usually&#13;
assumed.                                                    0&#13;
Nonetheless governments have continued to interfere extensively&#13;
in the market systems "to correct their imperfections' in the be-&#13;
lief that they are acting in the interest of the farmers, especially&#13;
small farmers. The results have been dismal. Often black markets&#13;
in essential inputs and outputs have developed reducing the quanti-&#13;
ties in open trade, increasing marketing costs, especially in small&#13;
markets, and adding illegitimate charges to the regular marketing&#13;
costs, all to the detriment especially of small farmers. Again&#13;
Lele (1976) has shown that government-controlled markets have not&#13;
been more efficient than the private markets they were designed to&#13;
replace. She found that (i) the effective weighted average price8&#13;
of the "controlled" and "uncontrolled" marketed surpluses were not&#13;
significantly different, and (ii) contrary to the popular view&#13;
the marketing margins incurred by government and parastatal agencies&#13;
were almost invariably higher than those incurred by traditional&#13;
traders. Government regulations have invariably led to illicit&#13;
trade that has increased the number of intermediaries, and by&#13;
reducing the scope of bulk trade have increased marketing costs.&#13;
Procurement systems have similarly been no boon to small farmers.&#13;
Large commercial farmers have been the greatest evaders of the pro-&#13;
curement system while the politically less powerful small farmers&#13;
have been its victims. 1/ Lele states that the lower effective&#13;
weighted average price earned by small farmers through more regular&#13;
1/ In India, in view of the shortage of agricultural commodities and&#13;
rising prices it was expected that the agricultural price policy&#13;
would prevent unduly favorable terms of trade for prosperous and&#13;
big farmers. However, big farmers have always succeeded in ge1ing&#13;
hiqher pocurement prices than those recommended by the Agricultural&#13;
Prices Commission and have evaded the producer levies. See Rao&#13;
(1975) for evidence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
sales of their marketed surplus to government agencies seems&#13;
particularly paradoxical as the surpluses are usually distributed&#13;
to relatively high income urban consumers.&#13;
Price controls may not be very helpful to most farmers, espe-&#13;
cially if threy are set on the basis of new technologies for then&#13;
they discriminate against farmers using more high cost traditional&#13;
technology.  This is particularly the case if new inputs are highly&#13;
subsidized and/or if the majority of farmers do not have access to&#13;
new technologies.&#13;
Finally the inelastic demand for foodgrains has a destabilizing&#13;
effect on farm incomes, in proportion to the amount of output mar-&#13;
keted and its weight in total income. As larger commercial farmers&#13;
market a larger share of their output they are more susceptible to&#13;
price instability in output markets. The opposite is true for small&#13;
farmers. Therefore price stabilization programs, though desirable&#13;
on other grounds,may be less necessary or beneficial in the case of&#13;
small farmers than is often assumed.&#13;
Finally, marketing cooperatives have often been seen as a&#13;
necessary solution to the perceived exploitation of small farmers&#13;
in the marke!ting of agricultural produce. But, as noted above,&#13;
there is considerable evidence to dispel these oligopolistic&#13;
stereotypes. Further, Lele (1977) found that differences in&#13;
prices received by small and large farmers in a given market are&#13;
far less significant than those between markets with and without&#13;
adequate transport connections. In addition traders (like money-&#13;
lenders) seem to provide important services to small producers which&#13;
cannot be replaced by government programs and cooperatives without&#13;
substantially greater costs. Traders function in the least acces-&#13;
sible areas and meet the small producer's credit needs which often&#13;
include consumption credits. The timely availability and flexibi-&#13;
lity of the much needed credit is an important reason why small&#13;
farmers often turn to traders even when cooperative marketing&#13;
channels are available. This is the reason for the "marketing&#13;
connection". There is little evidence of its exploitative elements,&#13;
even though repeated references to them have made it an accepted&#13;
fact.&#13;
Cooperatives may be effective in selling inputs as the market&#13;
margins for them are often fixed by government policy. But it may&#13;
be counter-piroductive to push cooperative development too rapidly&#13;
"as it frequently makes it a haven for subsidies" (Lele 1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Further, they are likely to suffer from problems similar to those&#13;
of credit cooperatives--poor management, financial instability and&#13;
subversion by powerful (usually large farmer) interests.&#13;
Apart from anecdotal experience no comparable empirical studies&#13;
on the operation of rural marketing systems are available for&#13;
Pakistan and Bangladesh and little more can be added.    tnefficient&#13;
handling, marketing and processing; inadequate storage; outmoded&#13;
sales practices; lack of marketing cooperatives, are all mentioned&#13;
as serious problems. In Pakistan, larger farmers are purported to&#13;
have an advantage in marketing because they sell through so-called&#13;
"non-fixed contracts" which small farmers cannot utilize.&#13;
To conclude, the evidence of small farmer bias in markets is&#13;
scanty and anecdotal, and the contention that small farmers suffer&#13;
from special problems of market access, significantly different&#13;
from problems all farmers encounter, is difficult to support.&#13;
Three conditions do, however, aggravate the problems of marketing&#13;
for small farmers:&#13;
- the need to sell cheap and buy dear;&#13;
the smaller amount of total output marketed and smaller&#13;
resulting cash incomes; and&#13;
- less-credit at reasonable terms to tide them over from&#13;
pre- to post-harvest periods.&#13;
C. Extension, Research and Education 1/&#13;
Little needs to be said about the critical importance of know-&#13;
ledge, and its effective dissemination in the farming community,&#13;
to the adoption of new technologies. The questions are (i) whether&#13;
or not small farmers systematically have lower access to research,&#13;
extension and education, and (ii) whether or not the knowledge&#13;
disseminated is appropriate to small farmer systems.&#13;
Small farmers do seem systematically to have less access 2/ to&#13;
the results of research and to extension, mainly because they are&#13;
'less educated. The rest seems to follow from this, because educated&#13;
farmers can not only press the system to deliver what they need, and&#13;
make sure the knowledge is appropriate to their needs, but also use&#13;
1/  There is presumably a lot more that can be said on each of these&#13;
subjects but limitations of time and space preclude an extensive&#13;
treatment. Further empirical evidence to substantiate some of&#13;
the statements is not readily available.&#13;
2/  Access can be measured in a number of ways--number of farmers/&#13;
agent, number of visits per week, number of demonstrations&#13;
attended/farmer etc. No hard evidence is available on these&#13;
measures by farm size.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
the knowledge more effectively when they receive it. The last&#13;
point is critical because if farms in South Asia are to undertake&#13;
scientific multiple cropping with intensive use of modern inputs,&#13;
they must have the management and financial skills to operate&#13;
-the complex agronomic systems that will result. Without education&#13;
the ability of small farmers to integrate new technologies into&#13;
present farming systems will be a major constraint. If one&#13;
single failure can be cited as a cause for the low capacity of&#13;
-the rural economies in South Asia *to absorb continuous economic&#13;
and agronomic changes it would be the low level of the human&#13;
capital in their rural areas.   Failure to achie'-ehigh rates&#13;
of rural l.iteracy will continue to act as a drag on the dynamism&#13;
of the rural sector in the years to come. 1/&#13;
As education and agricultural extension are provided as public&#13;
goods the problem is not one of effective demand but one of insti-&#13;
tutional access, and of the types of product that the extension or&#13;
other.services have to deliver.   If the extension services have&#13;
nothing to extend to-small farmers, it is not surprising that they&#13;
are not effective.   Administrative cost may be part of the reason&#13;
-why extension services do not reach more small farmers, but this&#13;
is not certain as alternative systems have not been tried.&#13;
An example of alternative forms of organization designed to&#13;
reach small farmers   is the Benor/Harrison extension system dis-&#13;
cussed in  Chapter m.    Aside from the rapid results achieved,&#13;
* under-this approach existing extension services have been re-&#13;
organized at a very low cost, by re-deploying existing staff&#13;
systematically. The incremental costs of reorganizing existing&#13;
extension services to actually deliver appropriate knowledge&#13;
have been found very low--around 50¢ to $1.50-per hectare per&#13;
year.  The cost to farmers of following recommended practices&#13;
is also-'very small, for the initial focus is on changing s.mple&#13;
agricultural practices. The fundamental problem in extension&#13;
services, Benor and Harrison point out, is the lack of a single,&#13;
'd'irect line of technical support and administrative control.&#13;
The details of the system are discussed elsewhere. 2/ Here we&#13;
need only to point it out as an example of the type of reorganiza-&#13;
tion that might be- necessary in order to make current institutions&#13;

fit small farmer needs better. Alternatively -.ew institutions&#13;
may have to be developed. But 'small farmer agencies", aside&#13;
from their high administrative costs, have not proved very effective0l/&#13;
While the new exte;nsion system offers many advantages, caution&#13;
is warranted because it has not been tried in all geographic regions&#13;
or technological environments and because it is relatively new0&#13;
But only experiments with new organizational forms are likeLy to&#13;
provide the type of-experience needed to make extension systems&#13;
relevant to small farmers. 2/&#13;
Finally, in research the priorities in South Asia are clear0&#13;
More research is needed on: (i) arid crops and arid agricultural&#13;
systems; (ii) the development and breeding of livestock, especially&#13;
small stock, (iii) the relationship between water use, multiple&#13;
cropping and nutrient appiications; and (iv) low-cash input cropping&#13;
systems and practices that would better suit small farmeral,needs.&#13;
1/ See Havinkurve and Sundernathan (1975) and Havinkurve and&#13;

marketing institutions.&#13;

chapter VI: NON-FARM EMPLOYMENT AND THE LANDLEL'.&#13;
We have established that productivity can be 3nc-r-       -&#13;
small farms, but that whether these gains will accrue as incrL-.&#13;
incomes wi:Ll depend on (i) the degree of access to necessary inputs -&#13;
water, nutrients, seeds, pesticides and credit -- none of which&#13;
are assurecd; and (ii) the terms of the tenancy under which small&#13;
tenant farmers operate. 1/ Even if all the productivity increases&#13;
could be translated into incomes on small farms, two additional&#13;
questions remain.&#13;
First., would these income increases, if realized, be adequate&#13;
to raise per capita incomes above some minimally acceptable poverty&#13;
level? Second, if not, what other opportunities for increasing&#13;
income (and employment) can be found to supplement incomes from&#13;
land? The answers to these questions depend upon the size of the&#13;
holding considered. It is useful to consider three broad groups:&#13;
- the near landless, farmers with less than one acre&#13;
(0.5 ha.) of land. For this group of farmers the&#13;
present land holdings are too small to provide an&#13;
adequate standard of living. Further, even if their&#13;
present farm incomes were doubled (i.e. more than a&#13;
doubling of yields - a range that is beyond the 60%-&#13;
80% maximum potential income increases to be expected&#13;
in either irrigated or unirrigated conditions, even&#13;
assuming zero levels of nutrient use at present) their&#13;
per capita incomes would remain well below subsistence&#13;
levels. 2/  Therefore they will have to rely mainly on&#13;
wage iIncomes from on-farm employment and improvements&#13;
in incomes from non-farm activities. In this regard&#13;
they are in the same category as the landless in that&#13;
they have to rely on wage incomes; they differ in that&#13;
they have some assets and can supplement their wage&#13;
incomes from their farm activities.&#13;
1/  The problems of tenurial structure (type, composition and terms&#13;
of tenancy) and the extent to which small holders are also&#13;
tenant farmers are critical to any understanding of how much of&#13;
the increased productivity potential will actually be realized&#13;
as increased real incomes to smallholders. This is a problem&#13;
that calls for a separate and detailed treatment.&#13;
2/  The broad arithmetic follows from Table 2.1 where more than two&#13;
acres are required to meet family subsistence. Income would&#13;
need to be much higher both because of the difference between&#13;
gross and net figures and because of the need to have items&#13;
other than food in the expenditure bundle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
120 =&#13;
- A second group consists of farmers with 1-2.5 acres -&#13;
the marginal farmers - whose holdingsat present levels&#13;
of productivity are too small to provide an adequate&#13;
standard of living, but whose incomes could be improved&#13;
substantially if farm yields could be increased to their&#13;
economic potential. For these farmers, non-farm wages&#13;
and incomes will continue to provide an essential supple-&#13;
ment to their farm incomes, even when presently available&#13;
farm productivity potentials have been exhausted. Fairming&#13;
alone will not suffice.&#13;
- Finally, there are those with more than 2.5 acres, the&#13;
small farmers proper, whose family holdings provide a&#13;
margin of living near subsistence but where productivity&#13;
increases of 50% or more could provide an "adequate"&#13;
standard of living. For them, non-farm wage and other&#13;
incomes could provide important supplements but improved&#13;
farm incomes would suffice in all but very poor years to&#13;
support their families. Farming alone could suffice but&#13;
will more likely continue to be supplemented by non-farm&#13;
incomes.&#13;
In evaluating the impact of any non-farm employment and income&#13;
opportunities it is essential to know to which group these oppor-&#13;
tunities are likely to accrue, But such information is very hard&#13;
to obtain. At best we can state that all three groups will be&#13;
competing, along with the landless, to a greater or lesser degree,&#13;
for these non-farm opportunities.&#13;
A. Extent of Non-Farm Employment&#13;
There is a tendency to neglect the role of non-crop and non-&#13;
farm employment and income opportunities, especially as supplements&#13;
to farm incomes. Non-farm activities in rural areas are a primary&#13;
source of employment and earnings for approximately one-third of&#13;
the rural labor force in most LDCs (one-third if we include rural&#13;
towns) and are a significant source of secondary earnings, especially&#13;
in the slack season for small farmers.&#13;

30% in Pakistan (Table 6.2). 1/&#13;
_/ This proportion has declined by 3 percentage points in India and&#13;

The importance of non-crop (non-farm) incomes for landless,&#13;
near-landless and small farmers is evident in the scattered data&#13;
for South Asia (Tables 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5). In India crop incomes&#13;
increase with the size of holding: these account for 0%, 40%, 60%,&#13;
and 80% of total incomes, respectively, as we move from the&#13;
near landless (less than one acre) to marginal (1 - 2.5 -cres) to&#13;
small (2.5--5 acres) holdings. Agricultural wages (and hence wage&#13;
employment in agricultural activities) are an important component&#13;
of income for the landless, near-landless and marginal farmers,&#13;
(Table 6.6). Although wage employment is the only source of income&#13;
for the landless, agricultural wage employment is not the primary&#13;
source. Employment in construction and rural services seems to&#13;
provide substantial incomes, although the evidence on this is not&#13;
conclusive. 1/&#13;
The available historical evidence reveals that a rising share&#13;
of the rural labor force is engaged in non-farm work, and an increas-&#13;
ing share of rural incomes come6from non-farm sources. In 1970-71,&#13;
19% of the rural employment in Pakistan's Punjab was in non-farm&#13;
activities; 48% of the farm families in Pakistan relied on secondary&#13;
sources of income from non-farm activities, which contributed to&#13;
23 % of their total income. Nearly 70% of the small farmers and&#13;
landless undertook non-farm work which accounted for nearly 39% of&#13;
their income. 2/ The Indian National Sample Survey (25th Round)&#13;
in 1970-71 showed that, on a statewide basis, a significant pro-&#13;
portion of households (35% of small cultivators and 43% of non-&#13;
cultivating wage earners) reported that they could supplement their&#13;
incomes in clifferent ancillary agricultural activities. 3/ Evidence&#13;
from farm management surveys in India indicated that off-farm&#13;
1/  For example in a study based in Dharampur-Gujarat, Desai et al&#13;
(1976) found the following composition for landless incomes -&#13;
68% agricultural wages, 32% grass cutting, forestry work,&#13;
cottage industries, construction and road work. Nearly 70% of&#13;
all labor in landless households was devoted to earning agri-&#13;
cultural wages.&#13;

employment had accounted for 50% of the small farmers' labor and&#13;
somewhat less of their incomes in the mid-1950s (Bharadwaj, 1974).&#13;
Fifteen years later, non-farm activities had assumed a greater&#13;
significance -- a large number of small farmers derived far more&#13;
income from subsidiary occupations such as dairying than they did&#13;
from farm work (Mavinkurve, 1975). In Tamil Nadu, for instance,&#13;
male agricultural laborers' average annual earnings from non-agri-&#13;
cultural occupations have increased from 10%-33% of their total&#13;
incomes over the last 20 years (ILO, 1977).&#13;
What do these inon-farm activities consist of? They are wide-&#13;
spread and diverse; ancillary agricultural activities are the most&#13;
important, along with commerce, services, transport, processing&#13;
and manufacturing (mostly on a very small scale). The main markets&#13;
for these activities are those generated by the growth og agri-&#13;
cultural and rural inccmes themselves. Further, it takes a certain&#13;
level of continuous and cumulative growth in agricultural incomes&#13;
to geherate a sustained growth rate in non-farm employment and&#13;
income opportunities. The evidence from the Republic of China, the&#13;
Republic of Korea, Japan and the Indian Punjab suggests that annual&#13;
agricultural growth of about 4%-5% cumulatively for four to five&#13;
years is needed to achieve any reasonable rate of growth (2%--5%)&#13;
in non-farm employment and incomes. 1/&#13;
B. Ancillary On-Farm Activities&#13;
In South Asia there are three broad sources of rural non-crop&#13;
incomes: (i) on-farm incomes from activities such as poultry, small&#13;
stock and dairy animals; (ii) peak season (for the landless) and off-&#13;
season (for small farmers) wage employment on other, presumably&#13;
larger, farms; and (iii) off-farm employment in repair services,&#13;
distribution and processing industries, the growth rate of which&#13;
depends on high and sustained rates of growth in agricultural&#13;
incomes. 2/ In the absence of the latter, the main hope for non-&#13;
1/ World Bank data, and Raj Krishna (1976).&#13;
2/ In India the composition of non-farm employment in rural areas&#13;
is:  38% in manufacturing, 14% each in construction    and commerce,&#13;
5% in transport and 24% in government and other services. and 5%&#13;
in a miscellaneous category. But who are engaged in these&#13;
sectors and where the employment is located is not known.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
farm employment (NFE) must come mainly from (i) and (ii). This is&#13;
what has generally occurred, and the little data we have from India&#13;
seem to confirm this. Visaria and Visaria (1973) report thdt&#13;
while a third of the small cultivating households reported the&#13;
possibility of supplementing their incomes, at least two-thirds&#13;
of these households reported this possibility from dairying and&#13;
,poultry. The same was the case with non-cultivating wage earners.&#13;
But actual incomes from these and other activities are not easy to&#13;
determine. 1/&#13;
Mavinkurve (1975) shows that among small farmers'(holdings&#13;
of less than 2.5 acres) incomes from on-farm ancillary activities&#13;
such as dairying are often comparable to or greater than incomes&#13;
from crop production, notably on farms in arid areas with less than&#13;
50% of the cultivated area irrigated. The fact that small farmers&#13;
tend to derive a larger share of their total incomes from subsidiary&#13;
non-crop but on-farm activities distinguishes them from other people&#13;
employed in rural non-agricultural activities. This might seem to&#13;
suggest that some minimum land assets, on which to grow feedstuffs,&#13;
are important"getting poultry, small stock and dairy activities&#13;
off the ground.&#13;
However, in World Bank rural development projects, dairying&#13;
components have had a significant impact on the incomes of very&#13;
small farmers and landless. Women have a primary responsibility&#13;
in this activity.  Earlier, the Amul Dairy project in Gujarat&#13;
formed hundreds of village level producer cooperatives; the system&#13;
now operates its own facilities and provides its members with a full&#13;
range of technical services. A typical member owns two buffaloes,&#13;
and tills less than one hectare. Experience shows that dairy projects&#13;
are highly successful ones and have good prospects for income gains&#13;
to large numbers of small, marginal and landless farmers.&#13;
[n India subsidiary income-increasing programs for marginal&#13;
and landless farmers, including milk production, poultry raising,&#13;
sheep rearing and pig raising have been the focus of such diverse&#13;
government organizations as the Small and Marginal Farmer Develop-&#13;
1/  To estimate the income distribution by source for non-cultivating&#13;
househo]lds, or the non-farm income of small cultivators from&#13;
survey data, becomes a complex matter since all rural house-&#13;
holds --- cultivators, agricultural laborers and self-employed--&#13;
reported availability for work in addition to the primary&#13;
occupation that they were gainfully employed in. (Visaria, 1970)&#13;

e'c1volopmnent Corporation and the Drought Prone Areas Project.&#13;
In another program in India conducted by the National Dairy&#13;
Development Loan -- Operation Flood -- one million rural milk&#13;
producers had joined 5,000 dairy cooperatives which enabled them&#13;
to market their milk efficiently, avoiding traditional middlemen&#13;
who had earlier monopolized profits. Most milk producers were&#13;
from poor rural households whose heads had only seasonal agri-&#13;
cultural work as a source of income, plus one cow or a buffalo.&#13;
Others were small holders with less than one hectare of land and&#13;
one or two milch animals. Further, Patel and Pandey (1976) report&#13;
in their study of the impact of cooperative dairying on the incomes&#13;
of small/marginal farmers and landless laborers in Gujarat that it&#13;
"was the single largest source of income to the landless families",&#13;
while for farmer/milk producers, most of the income still carne from&#13;
crop production. The incomes from dairying for all groups (land-&#13;
less and farmers of all sizes) increased when they joined coopera-&#13;
tive "milk unions", but even without membership in such coopera-&#13;
tives incomes from dairying are substantial, particularly in com-&#13;
parison with incomes from land, given past yields. (Table 6.7) 1/&#13;
Milk cooperatives have several advantages to their members.&#13;
These include: (i) guaranteed purchase of milk all year round;&#13;
(ii) homogeneously applicable pre-declared prices for milk; (iii)&#13;
proper measurement and quality control; (iv) no preferential treat-&#13;
ment for any individuals and (v) supply of cheap inputs (such as&#13;
cattle feed) and services (veterinary and consultation). As a&#13;
result of these advantages milk producers in "dairy villages"&#13;
in Gujarat's Kaira district have earned a higher gross income per&#13;
milch animal than in non-milk-union villages (Table 6.7). The&#13;
small farmers and landless depend particularly on these advantages&#13;
although large farmers were not reluctant to avail themselves of&#13;
the cooperative services . Nor were larger farmers able effectively&#13;
to control the cooperatives, as they have done in other credit and&#13;
marketing operations. Similarly, encouraging evidence is cited by&#13;
Thakur (I 97),  f     his study of four other cooperatives in Gujarat.&#13;
1/  As a comparison the landless income from milk,of Rs. 2000, is&#13;
equivalent to the gross income from 3.45 acres of rice land&#13;
and 2.8 acres of wheat land at past 5-year average yield levels&#13;
and current prices. (See average yields in Table 2.1)&#13;

The cash income obtained from the sale of milk by small holders&#13;
was cited as a means for obtaining modern inputs for farm opera-&#13;
tions allowing higher farm incomes. Further milk production per&#13;
animal and the total marketed surplus of milk was higher among the&#13;
landless and small farmers than among medium and large farmers.&#13;
The proportion of farm income earned from dairying is lower the&#13;
larger the farm.&#13;
IDA has followed up evidence of these successes with projects&#13;
to develop integrated programs for increasing milk productiorl in&#13;
Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka and three more Indian States. 1/ Early&#13;
reports from the field indicate that these are highly successful&#13;
projects with excellent prospects of "substantial income gains&#13;
to small, marginal farmers and the landless." How extensiveLy&#13;
and quickly such projects can be replicated, and whether or riot&#13;
they can provide income supplements to large numbers of landLess&#13;
is still an unanswered question. The necessary condition for&#13;
success seems to be the effective organization of milk marketing,&#13;
which may or may not be replicable everywhere. But dairying activi-&#13;
ties cannot be dismissed out-of-hand as one of the elements in a&#13;
more extensive and integrated effort at increasing the incomes of&#13;
the rural poor.&#13;
The Indian Institute of Management is using such an inte-&#13;
grated approach in Gujarat incorporating poultry and dairying&#13;
activities to raise subsistence incomes in poverty-stricken areas&#13;
along with a program of infrastructure, animal husbandry, fclrestry&#13;
and cottage industry development (Desai et. al., 1976).&#13;
These experiences indicate that there is substantial scope&#13;
for orienting rural strategies away from pure crop production and&#13;
towards developing a broader class of non-farm entrepreneurs in&#13;
the rural sector who could come mainly from the ranks of the small&#13;
farmers and the landless.&#13;

C. Wage Employment in Rural Areas and the Landless&#13;
What scope does rural wage employment provide for expanding&#13;
employment opportunities for the landless? An analysis of all the&#13;
issues involved is beyond the scope of the present paper, but a&#13;
few points are worth summarizing:&#13;
- Although a variety of often conflicting estimates are&#13;
given in various studies, the fact is that we do not know for&#13;
sure how many landless there are in South Asia. All we know is&#13;
that their numbers are large.   The best aggregate estimates we&#13;
can assemble were given in Table 1.3, but we need to note that&#13;
in all cases these are likely to be too low. This is particularly&#13;
true for Pakistan.&#13;
- There are two sources of growth in rural employment:(i) the&#13;
growth in the on-farm demand for wage labor and (ii) the growth in&#13;
non-farm employment, especially in processing, marketing, trans-&#13;
portation, repair and other services and input and consumer good&#13;
distribution systems. As noted above, both these sources of growth&#13;
are "agriculturally led". The relationship between the growth of&#13;
farm output and demand for wage labor largely depends on the size&#13;
distributior, of holdings, the cropping patterns and, most critically,&#13;
on farm technologies. Where agricultural growth has been rapid,&#13;
as in the two Punjabs, a lot of the potential stimulus to employment&#13;
has been offset by farm mechanization. 1/ Increased irrigation&#13;
and cropping intensities will definitely increase demand for farm&#13;
labor (although changes from persian tubewell irrigation may not),&#13;
but how much of this demand will be met by family as distinct&#13;
from wage labor is not certain. Attempts must be made to ensure&#13;
that rapid agricultural growth is not accompanied by a decline in&#13;
the labor intensities of agricultural production,especially where&#13;
there is surplus labor. But this is not a simple issue.&#13;
- The growth of non-farm employment depends upon linkages&#13;
within rural areas as well as linkages with the other (industry&#13;
and export) sectors. Although the importance of these rural&#13;
linkages, and agriculture-industry interactions has been repeat-&#13;
edly emphasized 2/ as possible means for increased employment&#13;
1/  The literature on these issues itself is vast and needs a more&#13;
careful treatment than is given here.&#13;
2/ See especially Mellor (1976), Mellor and Lele (1973) for rural&#13;
linkages and Johnston and Kilby (1975) for agriculture-industry&#13;
interactions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
opportunities in rural areas, little empirical work has been clone&#13;
to quantify first the linkages and second     their employment impact0&#13;
The anecdotal evidence and the little empirical evidence we have&#13;
a1l seem to suggest a high correlation between the rates of agri-&#13;
cultural growth and employment generation in rural areas. But the&#13;
evidence is mainly from areas where high rates of agricultura'L&#13;
growth have prevailed over considerable periods - East Punjab,&#13;
Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Malaysia. All this seems&#13;
to suggest that unless agricultural grouth exceeds an annual rate&#13;
of 3.5 - 4%, and that unless such a rate is sustained for at Least&#13;
a decade, these linkage effects will remain small and are not likely&#13;
to contribute much to the solution of the rural employment problem -&#13;
at least in a context where a high proportion of the rural popu-&#13;
lation is unemployed or underemployed, and the numbers of rural&#13;
unemployed are growing at rates exceedinq 2 percent per annum. So&#13;
a high and sustained rate of agricultural growth is a necessary&#13;
and sufficient condition for high rates of growth of non-farm&#13;
employment opportunities. These problems will never be solved if&#13;
agriculture is stagnant.&#13;
- The experience with rural work programs as a means for&#13;
providing employment in South Asia has been mixed. 1/ Although&#13;
they serve a very useful purpose in the relief of sudden disasters,&#13;
the salient fact is that they have had only an insignificant impact&#13;
on the magnitude of the rural unemployment problem, except in very&#13;
few cases and in a limited regional context. 2/ In South Asia,&#13;
whatever the organizational, productivity, implementation andl fiscal&#13;
problems associated with the development of rural work programs,&#13;
the sheer maqnitnlde of the task will continue to defeat their&#13;
purpose, if this purpose is to make substantial inroads into rural&#13;
unemployment. For this we will have to look to vigorous agr:L-&#13;
cultural growth. A stagnant agriculture will continue to assure&#13;
an increasing and insurmountable rural unemployment problem for&#13;
decades to come in South Asia.&#13;
1/ Again there is an extensive literature on this. See particularly&#13;
Raj Krishna (1973), Thomas and Hook (1977) Visaria and Visaria&#13;
(1973). A note summarizing some of the main features of experience&#13;
with rural works programs in South Asia is attached as Annex III.&#13;

tee Scheme in Maharastra is reported to be 38% p.a. between&#13;
1974/75 and 1977/78 (est.). The estimated mandays of employment&#13;
in 1977/78 are 160 million.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Rural Poverty and the Rural Poor&#13;
in South Asia: The Available Evidence&#13;
In recent years, there has been a growing and disquieting literature&#13;
on trends in rural poverty in South Asia. The literature is fairly exten-&#13;
sive for India although some recent work has also been done for Pakistan&#13;
and Bangladesh.- The recurring themes in much of this literature are&#13;
(1) that where agriculture growth has stagnated, the incidence of rural&#13;
poverty has definitely increased1 (2) That even where there has been&#13;
vigorous agriculture growth, this has been accompanied at times by steady&#13;
deterioration in the distribution of rural incomes with those in the bottom&#13;
20% gett:Lng the least from this growth; (3) That the absolute numbers of&#13;
the rural poor have increased everywhere. More seriously it has been argued&#13;
that even vigorous and sustained agricultural growth may not be accompanied&#13;
by any substantial decrease in either relative inequality of rural incomes&#13;
or by a decrease in absolute impoverishment.2'&#13;
Has rural poverty increased substantially in South Asia? There is&#13;
considerable controversy on the subject and while it is useful to review the&#13;
available evidence at least briefly, the controversial nature of (a) the&#13;
data and (b) the methodologies used should constantly be kept in mind.&#13;
The most extensive, emperical evidence on trends in rural poverty&#13;
in India, has been presented by Ahluwalia (1977) and we can no no better&#13;
than to present his finding.&#13;
l/ See Dandekar and Rath (1971), Bardhan (1970/1973), Raj (1976),&#13;
Vaidyanathan (1974), Minhas (1970/1974), Lal (1976), Bhatty (1974),&#13;
C.H.H. Rao (1977), Rajaraman (1977), Nay yar (1977a, 1977b), and Kurien&#13;
(1977). Most of these studies have been reprinted in T.N. Srinivasan&#13;
and P.K. Bardhan (1974), and I.L.0. (1977). For a comprehensive treat-&#13;
ment of the available evidence on India see Ahluwalia (1977). For the&#13;
work on Pakistan and Bangladesh see Naseem (1973/1977), T.M. Khan and&#13;

Using NSS consumer expenditure data, Ahiluwalia has calculated the&#13;
percentages of the rural population below "a given poverty line" for Inidia&#13;
as a whole and for each of the states. Ele ha also calculated the Gini. co-&#13;
officients for rural incomea.&#13;
The most important findinas of his study are as follows:&#13;
(1)  For India as a whole, there is a marked fluctuation over time&#13;
in the extent and incidence of rural poverty, so that there&#13;
is no evidence for a t-rend increase or decrease in rural poverty&#13;
over the period as a whole.&#13;
(2)  The absence of any discernable trend in the incidence of&#13;
poverty definitely implies that the absolute number of the&#13;
rural poor has grown significantly over time. Ahluwalia cal-&#13;
culates this on an average of about 5 million people every year.&#13;
(3)  For the states (and using state specific data) the incidence&#13;
of poverty also follows a pattern similar to that of India as&#13;
a whole with no discernable trends. (Only two states, Assam&#13;
and West Bengal show a significant trend increase in poverty,&#13;
while two others Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu show a trend&#13;
decline.) This also implies that for most of the Indian states9&#13;
the absolute number of the rural poor must have increased.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
If we were to apply the percentages of rural population in poverty&#13;
estimatedi by Ahluwalia for 1973-74 to the rural population in 1977, we&#13;
would gel: an estimated 297 million people in rural areas living below the&#13;
poverty line.-/&#13;
The work on rural poverty in Pakistan is less extensive and far&#13;
less detailed or careful. In a study done in 1968. Khan and Bose showed&#13;
that per capita incomes in the agricultural sector had declined for East&#13;
Pakistan between 1949-50 and 1963-64, but had increased, though very&#13;
gradually for West Pakistan. Even for West Pakistan, they considered the&#13;
average income to be barely above the subsistence level, and notes that&#13;
the majority of the farming population had less than the average income&#13;
during those periods.&#13;
[n a more extensive study, Naseem (1973) indicated that there was&#13;
a conflici: between the findings obtained from the national account data and&#13;
1/ Estimated at Rs. 15 per person for 30 days at 1960-61 rural prices.&#13;
The line is necessarily arbitrary in all work of this kind but Ahluwalia&#13;
states; that it has an "established pedigree" in Indian literature. It&#13;
is a level that is supposed to correspond to an expenditure level at&#13;
which food consumption (on average) provided the "norm" of 2250 calories&#13;
per day", and represents "an extremely low level of living". (op. cit.)&#13;
pgs. 6-7. Although there are difficulties in translating the notion&#13;
of nutritional minimum (on which there is disagreement) into a pov7erty&#13;
line in terms of consumption expenditures, (see Sukhatme 1977) all&#13;
studies have started with such a similar base. Aside from the problems&#13;
of reliability of expenditure data on which such studies are based there&#13;
are the problems of which poverty line to choose (results are very&#13;
sensitive to this choice), what price deflators to use to obtain real&#13;
expenditures over time (to reflect the impact of changing relative prices&#13;
upon the commodity composition of consumption); how to extrapolate&#13;
between expenditure classes within which the poverty line falls (to avoid&#13;
typically wide range estimates of poverty incidence) and what period to&#13;
choose for analysis. It is therefore not surprising that major studies&#13;
of the incidence of poverty come to very different conclusions on the&#13;
direction of change. See Minhas (1970) and Bardhan (1974. Further,&#13;
even such careful work admittedly with arbitrary concepts has not b an&#13;
done for Pakistan and BangLadesh.&#13;

the household survey data.-/ He showed that tho notiorl income data&#13;
revealed substantially higher increeoe in Tural por capita incomso than&#13;
expenditure date especially after 1963=64 which ho attributed to the&#13;
advent of the Green Revolution. In a study dono with household expenditure&#13;
data, he estimated that the percentages of poor below a given "poverty&#13;
line" had decreased substantially for West Pakioten over the period 1963--64&#13;
and 1969-70. In a more recent study, Naseew (1977) is not so certain ev(an&#13;
about his earlier findinas. Using three different poverty levels respectively&#13;
representing the amounts of income that permit the intake of 95%, 92% and&#13;
90% of the minimum calories required per capita to define three separate&#13;
poverty lines, he reaches a self-evident conclusion that the proportion&#13;
of the population below these poverty lines varies considerably depending&#13;
on the poverty line chosen suggesting the arbitrary nature of the findings./&#13;
Indeed when he does this analysis he further stateo that there is "no&#13;
definite trend in the incidence of vovertv" even WheU "poverty" is an&#13;
arbitrary index0   When he defines povorty in "the most ettreme and intolerable&#13;
terms", (i.G., the level of erpenditure pasletti&amp;g the intake of no moreD&#13;
then 90% of the minimum required calorieo) he indo thaet the percentage of&#13;
people in poverty has remained roughly tho sa2e ovor the years.    For example,&#13;
for 1971-72, he estimates that 54% of tho rural households and 43% of the&#13;
rural population are below theso 4mtrace levels of povgrty0    This, of course,&#13;
implies that the absolute number of houoeholdo and population below such&#13;
levels has increased substantiallv over tho yeGars, a finding similar to&#13;
1/  A similar conflict arises in interpreting Indian date, but the implications&#13;
for analyzing the Pakistan data are not pursued by eoseem in any detail.&#13;
2/  This is true of all studies that havo cared to opecify more than one&#13;
poverty line. As each poverty line is in a way arbitrary,D calculations&#13;
of the numbers of poor below poverty from such studie is also&#13;
arbitrary. It is a game any number can play.&#13;

that of India but more disquieting because of the higher rate of agricul-&#13;
tural growth experienced there.l/&#13;
The work on incidence of rural poverty in Bangladesh is not very&#13;
extensive, has similar problems but is perhaps less equivocal in its&#13;
findings.-/    For example, Khan and Bose found that in East Pakistan the&#13;
income level in agriculture had actually declined between the periods 1949-50&#13;
and 1963-64.&#13;
Looking at more detailed data,&#13;
Bose (1968), concluded that there was a fall in per capita income of the&#13;
agriculture population during the entire period of the fifties except for a&#13;
slight reversal observed 1963-64. Further, examining data on real agri-&#13;
cultural wages, he concluded that real wage earnings in Bangladesh were&#13;
lower in any year during the entire period 1951-60 than in 1949, and that&#13;
1/ Of course not all studies reach this conclusion. For example, Allaudin&#13;
(1975) indicates that both the percentages, and the absolute numbers if&#13;
persons lying below "the poverty line", has decreased substantially in&#13;
West Pakistan. But this is a different poverty line. Part of the problem,&#13;
of course, is the definition of the poverty line. The higher the annual&#13;
per capita expenditure chosen to represent this poverty line, the more&#13;
likely is it that the incidence of poverty would have failed to decline. However,&#13;
the lower one chooses such a poverty line, the greater the probability&#13;
that the data will show a declining or steady incidence of poverty.    This is&#13;
true also of the data presented by Naseem (1977).&#13;
The increasing incidence of extreme poverty in West Pakistan is also&#13;
difficult to reconcile with the data on rural wages. A recent study by&#13;
Gisinger (1977) showed that real wages of casual agricultural workers&#13;
remained stable over the 1959-66 period but began to rise after 1966&#13;
at about a rate of about 2.5% per annum. The real wages of permanent&#13;
agricultural workers also showed a very similar trend over the 1966-73&#13;
period. The pattern of increase was found to be fairly uniform across&#13;
all districts. Similar problems arise in discussing the incidence of&#13;
increasing poverty in Punjab-Haryana in India,&#13;

after thea decline in 1962 it roso to reach a peak tLa 1964, but then declined&#13;
in the following years8 0o that "by 1966 mil ocal. wtos were at a level&#13;

In a move recent study, A.L. Mia   (1977) he statod that aost studies&#13;
includina those for Bangladesh, maa no a110 8  Eanc  foro differgeces in&#13;
calorie requirements for different types og wers.o'       In order to do this&#13;
he has defined two aroups.   One he calls thdgabooluto poor"'whose calorie&#13;
intake is only 90% of the recommended reGqu&amp;remnta for their occupation, and&#13;
those he calls in&amp;'extreme poverty1whose calorie intakes are only 8o0' of the&#13;
recommended requirements.   Thus, thGo"abeolutaly poorVby his definition are&#13;
severely undernourished and thoSe he c&amp;lls tho!"atvemely poor"are in a state&#13;
of"acute malnutritionl"for much of the yeGr. Uoin( these categories he has&#13;
shown that there has been a sharp increzeo In tha Incidence of poverty in&#13;
the decade and a half since the early 1960 In DavglndGoh.2/The increase in&#13;

hard during the peak season as sooe richahaw pullars whoOe calorie&#13;
requirements are as high as 5,000 calories poa day.    Man angaged in&#13;
exceptionally heavy work such ao haxrvotin3; without mechanical help, have&#13;
reached levels of 5,000 calories por day over a few days.    Of course among&#13;
these are the  mall holders and also thGoe landless laborers who are also&#13;
among the poorest classes In Dangladash. EG therefore arEgues that we have&#13;
to make allowance for differences in calorgi requirements when looking&#13;
at welfare estimates and comparing them for different groups.&#13;
2/ Again all the problems associated with reaching this type of conclusion&#13;
are ignored. See footnote on page 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
the proportion of the "extremely poor" is especially large. His calculation&#13;
show thai: while only 5% of the rural population in 'Bangladesh could be cate-&#13;
gorized as being"extremely poor"in 1963-64, the proportion rose to over 40%&#13;
in the 1'1709. The proportion of the population that is"labsolutely poor"&#13;
was about 40% in 1963-67 and is estimated to be nearly 62% in 1975. Khan&#13;
has also examined the evidence on real agricultural wages and, although he&#13;
finds no trend over the entire period since the early fifties, he states&#13;
categorically that after 1964 real wages started to decline, and that this&#13;
significant trend has been accelerated sharply in the early seventiesl/&#13;
In view of this evidence, Khan concludes that (1) the&#13;
level of the living standards of the vast majority of the rural population&#13;
in Bangladesh has declined in absolute terms during the recent decades.&#13;
The real wages of agricultural laborers has fallen. This phenomena have been&#13;
particularly pronounced in recent years. (2) The per capita rural incomes&#13;
and output: have also fallen in recent decades especially during the last five&#13;
years. Average incomes have thus moved in the same direction as the incomes&#13;
of the vas,t majority of the people. It is, however, not true that incomes&#13;
of all groups have fallen. A very significant proportion of the households&#13;
at the top of the scale have obtained increases in real income.&#13;
These are sober but hardly surprising findings especially for India&#13;
and Bangladesh where there has been an overall stagnation (in India) or a&#13;
decline (Bangladesh) in agricultural production in per capita terms. The&#13;
surprise, of course, comes for West Pakistan where there has been a substantial&#13;

In India and Bangladesh the problems of rural povegty cannot be&#13;
separated from the problem of mz8gatiom in theo &amp;6     ltual segtor.   Ahlu'alia&#13;
(1977) has also tried to determine to what egeant the incidenG of rgural&#13;
poverty depends upon aariculture pGrforance in India using indieos of food&#13;
production, agriculture production and net domestic product per hGad of rural&#13;
population. He found that none of these indices have ohown any significant&#13;

he regrasses thQes indices against his estiates of the pereGntage of poor&#13;
in the rural population using all India data, he found that there is clear&#13;
evidence of a negative relationship.&#13;
Repeating a similar exercise with datea from individual states, he&#13;
found clear evidence of a significant negative relationship between aggri&#13;
cultural output per head and incidence of rural poverty in at least seven&#13;
of the fourteen states -- Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnatic, Hadhya PradGsh,&#13;
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. It is important, he says, that&#13;

these states account for nearly 56% of the rural populafion in India and&#13;
about 3/4 of the rural population in poverty. The disturbina results are,&#13;
however, for six states (Kerala, Oriesa, Puajnj   &amp;Eryana, T-a3il Nadu,&#13;
U.P. and West Bengal) which show significaent gouth in aGricultural output&#13;
per head but no significant trend declines in the incidence of poverty.&#13;
Obviously, there are other factors at work in thB rural economy - increased&#13;
population pressures reducing the sige distribution of holdinas, the extent&#13;
and conditions of tenancy, fragmentation of holdings, the distribution of&#13;
rural assets and the extent of employment growth in the other sectors --&#13;
that tend to increase the inequallty of incomes in the rural sector and&#13;
the incidence of poverty. In these cases, all agricultural growth does is&#13;
to partly offset the adverse effect of these factorso&#13;
The only way to reconcile growth in agricultural output per head&#13;
with an increase in the incidence of poverty, as in the case of some Indian&#13;
states and West Pakistan, is to assume that there has been an unequal dis-&#13;
tribution of the benefits of growth and an associated increase in rural&#13;
income inequality.&#13;
What about the evidence on increasina rural income ineoualities?&#13;
Again, using NSS's data and calculating Gini co-efficient5 of the distribution&#13;
of rural consumption expenditures of India as a whole and the individuial&#13;
states, Ahluwalia (1977) showed that far from an increase in relative in-&#13;
equality, there was evidence that pointed in the opposite direction. There&#13;
was a significant trend decrease in the relative inequality for India as a&#13;
whole and for seven of the fourteen states. In particular, he found the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
Gini co-efficients for Punjab-Haryana showed a significant decline in&#13;
inequality over a two decade period. The same general conclusions can&#13;
be drawn from Table A.3.&#13;
Alt:hough there is less careful work on Pakistan and Bangladesh,&#13;
most authors have asserted that there has been growing inequalities in&#13;
these two countries even though the available evidence in Table A.3 does&#13;
not show this./    But one can neither conclude confidently that substantial&#13;
improvements in the standards of living, at least for the poorest rural&#13;
classes, have occurred in South Asia. At present, given the unreliable&#13;
nature of the data, the problems with methodology and the arbitrariness&#13;
of the notion of "poverty", these issues must remain unresolved.&#13;
1.2   Who Are the Rural Poor?&#13;
Census data in South Asia prevent the careful mapping of income&#13;
or expenditure data into rural occupational classes easily. Therefore,&#13;
information on who the rural poor are is at best again conjectural. But&#13;
there is wide agreement that in rural areas in South Asia an important&#13;
cause of poverty is lack of land resources. A large bulk of the rural poor,&#13;
according to Minhas (1974) in India belong to (1) agricultural labor house-&#13;
holds without land, (2) agricultural labor households with very little&#13;
land, (3) other rural labor households without land and (4) all small&#13;
land operators usually with operating holdings below five acres in size.&#13;
Similar statements about Bangladesh and Pakistan would not be far from the&#13;
truth.&#13;
1/ See Naseem (1977) and Khan (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
148 -&#13;
For India, Dandekar and Rath (1971) have tried to map"poverty"into&#13;
occupational classes to determine who the rural poor are. Using NSS survey&#13;
aaricultural&#13;
data for 1956-57 and 1963-64, they found that about 60% o    e_he/labor house-&#13;
holds had no land at all, and hence depended almost entirely on the personal&#13;
labor of their members. They had no other means of livelihood. The remaining&#13;
40% of these households cultivated small pieces of land. NeverthelesEs, their&#13;
main dependence was on wage employment in agriculture or outside agriculture.&#13;
Again, of these agricultural labor households, nearly 3/4 worked as casual&#13;
laborers and another 1/4 as attached laborers. When they examined th(e per&#13;
capita consumption of these groups, they found that nearly 57% of the agri-&#13;
cultural labor households lay below what they considered minimum levels. The&#13;
incidence of"poverty"was much more common among agricultural labor households&#13;
than among all rural households. When they examined standards of living&#13;
associated with what they called "rock-bottom physical existence", they&#13;
found that agricultural labor households constituted more than 40% oE all&#13;
households living in this category. Thus, they conclude that the rural&#13;
poverty at the lowest level is largely accounted for by agricultural labor&#13;
households.   The remaining poor they conjecture are small cultivators.&#13;
Examining the distribution of consumer expenditures of cultivating&#13;
households, they found that nearly 75% of the households with size of cul-&#13;
tivated land between half an acre and 1.5 acres, lived below poverty levels.l/&#13;
However, even with cultivated land holdings between 3-1/2 to 5 acres, nearly&#13;
60% of the households still lived below poverty in 1963-64. There is little&#13;
evidence to show that conditions have changed substantially in this regard&#13;
1/ Cultivating households with less than 0.5 acres are classed as labor&#13;
households, both because they derive their main income from labor and&#13;
because their consumer expenditure patterns and levels are similar to&#13;
those of agricultural labor households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
in the last decade. It is clear then that the rural poor consist predominately&#13;
of agricultural labor households and small land holders (specially tenants)&#13;
with cultivated holdings of less than 5 acres and particularly less than&#13;
2-1/2 acres. Minhas (1974) reaches similar conclusions. He states, for&#13;
example, that between 75Z and 852 of all households with less than 5 acres&#13;
of operations holdings lay below a similar"lpoverty line',' he calculated for&#13;
1960-61.&#13;
Alt:hough no such detailed studies are available for Pakistan'and&#13;
Bangladesh, it is obvious that similar conclusions apply, with perhaps equal&#13;
force and studies by Naseem (1977) and Khan (1977) imply this.&#13;

Annex tI&#13;
YIELD-FERTILIZER RESPONSE AND SMALL FARBER YIELD POTENTIALS&#13;
The physical yields that can be obtained in any agronomic setting depend&#13;
on (1) the degree of water control, (2) the management and cropping practiceG&#13;
followed, (3) the weather and (4) the amounts of nutrients used. This anne=&#13;
attempts to evaluate the potential yield increases that are likely on majll&#13;
farms from increased fertilizer use given the conditions of water control,&#13;
management and cropping practices and weather.&#13;
In order to do this we have first estimated yield-nitrogen response&#13;
surfaces for several food crops (paddy, wheat, maize, jower ), for both HYV&#13;
and local varieties and under irrigated and unirrigated conditions in India&#13;
and Bangladesh. These response functions are ceteris-paribus physical yield&#13;
responses to nitrogen only. The response to this nutrient is usually the&#13;
most important. Additional inputs of potash and phosphorus can also increase&#13;
yields by their interactions with nitrogaen. But yieldNPK re$sponae data wGra&#13;
just not available. (These are drawn in figuras A.l-Ao.)&#13;
Furthermore, nitrogen accounts for 50-100% of the total input use on&#13;
most crops and the yield response to nitrogen is usually ths- highest for&#13;
foodcrops. (See Table A.l.)&#13;
By using these we were able to plot the yield responses to nitrogen to&#13;
establish the maximum agronomic yields (the point C on the response curves&#13;
where additional N implies a reduction in yield ceteris paribus), and the&#13;
base or control yields (yields at zero levels of fertilization - point A on&#13;
the response curves). This allows us to estimate the agronomic potential as&#13;
the difference between maximum yields possible and the control yields (C-A).&#13;

Next we calculated the average nitrogen (nutrient equivalent) to output&#13;
price ratios (Pn/Po) for the given foodgrain crops for two periods:-/&#13;
(1) 1965-72 to reflect the period prior to the increase in petroleum prices&#13;
and (ii) 1972-74 to reflect the increased prices. Interestingly enough&#13;
although the average price of nitrogen increased nearly twofold in India&#13;
and nearly threefold in Pakistan between the two periods, so did the prices&#13;
of major foodgrains. As a result the nutrient/foodgrain price ratios&#13;
remained fairly constant in the two periods (See attached tables).&#13;
By plotting the nutrient/output price ratios and seeking their tangency&#13;
points with the yield-fertilizer response curves (points D and E) we were&#13;
able to estimate the economically optimum nitrogen use level - ceteris&#13;
paribus - and estimate the yields at the economic optimum for these two&#13;
periods.2/&#13;
Finally, we obtained data on nitrogen use- /(in kg/ha) by small (S)&#13;
medium (M) and large (L) farms for each of the crops separately for&#13;
comparable years (1968-69). The yields corresponding to the nitrogen use&#13;
on small farms was used to represent the estimated current yields on small&#13;
farms (B).&#13;
1/   Prices were adjusted for the nitrogen content in various fertilizers&#13;
and harvest/procurement prices on foodgrains were used and adjusted by&#13;
the wholesale foodgrain prices indices where necessary.&#13;
2/   This is a ceteris paribus exercise.    In particular we have assumed that&#13;
any additional yield dependent labour inputs have a zero opportunlty&#13;
cost on small farms. In addition, no other costs are involved - like&#13;
pesticides or weeding care - and small farmers are assumed to have the&#13;
credits at a eero opportunity cost with which to purchase fertilizers.&#13;
3/   Again total NPK use is higher.   Only the nitrogen quadrant is used for analysi&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
The difference between the yields at current (1968-69) levels of&#13;
nitrogeni use and the economically optimum yields at the two price ratios&#13;
[(D-B) and (E-B)] gives as an estimate of the economic potential on small&#13;
farms - that is the yield increases to be expected on small farms given&#13;
profit maximizing behaviour at the given price ratios and assuming that&#13;
on the average small farmer yields are indicated by their current levels&#13;
ot nutrient use. It can be readily seen that although the agronomic&#13;
potential is relatively high (an increase in yields of between 20-80% for&#13;
irrigated and 10-65% for unirrigated crops could be obtained over yields&#13;
at current levels of nutrient use) the economic potential is much lower&#13;
(increase in yields of between 5-60% on irrigated and 0-30% on unirrigated&#13;
crops) but still considerable.&#13;
Lata Sources and Tables&#13;
In compiling the data and sources for this limited exercise the following&#13;
adi .nmptions were used:&#13;
(1) The yield response to nitrogen of some of the dominant varieti 3&#13;
has been considered typical. We recognize the enormous diversity in the&#13;
vield-response surfaces throughout the subcontinent-/ and were limited by&#13;
the availability of data on crop-specific nutrient use in choosing the&#13;
-:urfdces for this exercise. The data on responses were obtained (extrapolated&#13;
from graphs) from the study by the Indian Statistical Institute (1974);&#13;
(2) Cuuntrv and crop-specific harvest/procurement prices were used and&#13;
adjusted by the wholesale/foodgrain price indices wherever necessary;&#13;
(3; All resiponse surfaces, prices and nitrogenous fertilizer use data were&#13;
:onverted to the appropriate nutrient equivalent by adjusting the gross&#13;

RURAL WORKS PROGRAMS IN SOUTH ASIA&#13;
In view of (i) the large numbers of unemployed and underewTmloyed&#13;
in the rural areas of South Asia, (ii) the low overall elasticities of&#13;
on-farm and off-farm employment relative to (tit) tho still extensive&#13;
additions to the rural labor force expected in the decade ahead, we&#13;
have to arrive at the conclusion that mere growth, at least at rates expe-&#13;
rienced in the past or expected in the future and of the type experienced&#13;
in the past, will not solve the problem of rural unemployment. Indeed,&#13;
in the decades ahead even accelerated and optiEistic agricultural growth&#13;
rates will be associated with positive unemployMent growth in rural areas.&#13;
Therefore, a case for short-run relief to the unemployed becomes unassail-&#13;
able. As Raj Krishna (1973) has pointed out:&#13;
"A society which has failed to reduce the unemployment&#13;
problem in two decades of development cannot ask its&#13;
unemployed to wait indefinitely for the utterly uncertain&#13;
prospect of employment growth catching up with population&#13;
growth or income growth." (p. 18)&#13;
It is in this context that one needs to ask to what extent large&#13;
scale public works programs can be effective in creating new sources of&#13;
employment in rural areas, while at the same time constructing assets for&#13;
increased economic growth.&#13;
A. Past Experience with Public&#13;
Works ProArams in South Asia&#13;
There has been considerable use of public works programs in&#13;
South Asia, and their experience has been entensively studied. 1/ These&#13;
include three programs in Bangladesh--(i) the Works Program (WP), (ii) the&#13;
Thana Irrigation Program (TIP) and (iii) the IntQgrated Rural Development&#13;
Program (IRDP)--two programs in Pakistan--(i) the Rural Works Program (RWP),&#13;
and (ii) the Peoples Works Program (PWP)=-ead three programs in India&#13;
--(i) the Scarcity Relief Program (SRP), (ii) the Creeh Scheme for Rural&#13;
Emplayment (CSRE) and (lii) the Drought Prone Areas Program (DPAP). Although&#13;
the literature on this subject is extensive and greiftg, the detailed study&#13;
done by the Bank provides the most useful review 2/ and its conclusions&#13;
1/ For a detailed review see S.J. Burki et.al. "Public Works Programs in&#13;
Developing Countries: A Comparative Analysis," World Bank Staff Working&#13;
Paper No. 224, February 1976.&#13;

remain valid for the programs listed above. We can do no better than to&#13;
summarize its conclusions. A more recent effort--the Maharastra Employment&#13;
Guarantee Scheme (HEGS)--has evinced considerable interest because of its&#13;
novel and comprehensive approach and apparently extensive and successful&#13;
application.  Both factors place it in a category differen., f: a the c&#13;
programs, and we review its experience in the next section.&#13;
The basic characteristics and available data on the selected&#13;
public works programs in South Asia are summarized in Table 1.    The find-&#13;
ings of the Bank Study show that:&#13;
(:L) Although the programs have generally been geared to provide&#13;
employment to specific target groups-the "rural poor", the&#13;
"most needy", "poor surplus agricultural labor"'these groups&#13;
were not the only ones which were included. Indeed the&#13;
targeting was neither wery spec4f4c4gor vejy.efiective in&#13;
practice.&#13;
(2) Although all these programs contained elements of long-term&#13;
employment and infrastructure development they were primarily&#13;
disaster relief or income augmenting in nature. They were&#13;
not designed either to solve the rural unemployment problem&#13;
or to create rural assets effectively and efficiently. Their&#13;
success in these latter categories was limited. They have&#13;
been planned and implemented in isolation and not as part of&#13;
a broader strategy either to create new rural assets or to&#13;
attack the fundamentals of the unemployment problem. Indeed&#13;
the physical, budgetary and political constraints inherent&#13;
(at conception) in these programs make it impossible for them&#13;
alone to employ all those without jobs or to provide supple-&#13;
mental seasonal incomes to all those who need them.&#13;
(3)  As instruments for creating large-scale employment opportuni-&#13;
ties in rural areas these programs were far from effective.&#13;
The Bangladesh WP provided only 29 million days of employment&#13;
annually which works out to an average of 1.5 days per member&#13;
of the labor force annually. Similarly, figures calculated&#13;
by the study for the annual average work days generated per&#13;
member of the labor force are 0.2 for India's DPAP and 0.3&#13;
for Pakistan's RWP. Even for India's Crash Scheme for Rural&#13;
Employment which provided some 178 million man days of employ-&#13;
ment in total, the figure is low--one man day per member of&#13;
the labor force (Table 2). Even if one were to accept a very&#13;
low estimate of only 10% of the rural labor force unemployed&#13;
(or underemployed), these figures suggest that these programs&#13;
provided only between 10-15 days &lt;anxtum) of&#13;
-mannually per unemployed in rural areas.&#13;
(4) For those who do get employed on public works projects, their&#13;
wages make a major impact on their short-term income and con-&#13;
sumption levels. A study of public works in Bangladesh in 1968&#13;

all these figures suggest the importencae of public works as&#13;
income augmnting, as distinct froo pGrzneat incom-maintain-&#13;
ing programs, even for the smell proportion of the rural&#13;
unemployed they affect.&#13;
(5) Expenditures on most of the public works progreas have been&#13;
relatively qmall in relation to GDP, aad have thua had no&#13;
major inflationary impact. 3/ Strona inflationary pressures&#13;
on food prices have resulted where crieio/relief type pro5rams&#13;
have concentrated their activities in a    mall geographie area.&#13;
In Maharashtra, for example, 1973-74 thG Scarcity Relief&#13;
Program generated an estiwmted 290 million worker days of&#13;
employment in a period when successive crop failures had&#13;
produced strong upward pressures on cereal prices. What&#13;
the inflationary impact would be of a large rural works&#13;
program in the country as a whole during a period of normal&#13;
or increasing food supplies is not known, nor does past e2pe&#13;
rience tell us how to handle such a situation.&#13;
(6) The need for rural works programs, at least of the income-&#13;
augmenting type, varies inversely with the demand for agri-&#13;
cultural labor. If they are to reach those that need addi-&#13;
tional employment rural works programs have to be based on&#13;
a detailed knowledge of local seasonal eoploym2nt patterns,&#13;
for both on-farm and off-farm activities. In this regard&#13;
most of these programs have done an effective job by&#13;
"coordinating public works activities with seasonal needs,&#13;
concluding, deferring or interrupting projects in order to&#13;
avoid conflicts during periods of pash agricultural employment."&#13;

follows: Bangladesh (WP) 0.57%, India (SRP) 0.33%, India (CSRE)&#13;
0.15%, India (DPAP) 0.05% and Pakistan (R3P) 0.19%. The GDP propor-&#13;
tion tends to understate total costs by between 10-25% since offi-&#13;
cial figures usually exclude local and regional contributions and&#13;
those administrative costs included in other department budgets.&#13;

However, long-term employment programs which offer year-&#13;
round jobs can present serious problems especially if they&#13;
pay high wages, for then they can outbid the agricultural&#13;
sector for labor in peak seasons, resulting in a labor&#13;
shortage in agricul-ture. Detailed evidence on alternative&#13;
employment patterns and wage rates (which could allow one to&#13;
caiculate the opportunity cost of the programs) is not avail-&#13;
able. The Pakistan RWP may have paid high enough to reduce&#13;
ithe supply of rural labor to other activities (Table 2)&#13;
but we do not know whether this actually happened. ln .die&#13;
past the amount of employment created and the wages paid&#13;
have depended on how much emphasis was given to employment&#13;
generation as opposed to other objectives such as the low-&#13;
cost construction of assets. The percentage of total ex-&#13;
penditures going to wages is shown in the last column in&#13;
Table 2. Both the programs in Pakistan were classified in&#13;
the low employment-creating category, while Bangladesh's&#13;
WP (1962-67) was at times a high employment-generating&#13;
program. Both the CSRE and DPAP in India are considered&#13;
medium-to-high employment-creating programs. 1/&#13;
(7)  Experience in South Asia shows that most of the programs&#13;
have given priority to the development of directly&#13;
productive projects and economic infrastructure as distinct&#13;
from social infrastructure (Table 3). This is contrary to&#13;
the commonly expressed fear that public works programs do&#13;
not create valuable rural assets. But among the programs&#13;
reviewed, only India's DPAP had substantial outlays on&#13;
directly productive rural assets--those that could be expected&#13;
to have a direct impact on agricultural growth. Most of the&#13;
outlays one suspects have been on road construction in rural&#13;
areas, as this type of activity has traditionally been well&#13;
organized under the PWD administrative structures extant in&#13;
South Asia. Programs have often concentrated on providing&#13;
employment in the so-called "construction phase" rather than&#13;
creating assets with a longer term impact on unemployment&#13;
or poverty. Wage payments with this type of activity alone&#13;
are unlikely to eliminate poverty for those employed or&#13;
to change permanently in any way their position in the rural&#13;
income distribution.&#13;
(8)  The distribution of benefits from these programs depended&#13;
to a large extent on factors beyond the programs' control.&#13;
But in the "construction phase", these programs are not&#13;
distributionally neutral as their wage payments transfer&#13;
resources to those most likely to be in poverty. Secondary&#13;

and tertiary benefits depend on the types of works carried&#13;
out. Directly productive projects (irrigation, drainage,&#13;
soil conservation) have the greatest impact on future&#13;
production and thus the highest potential for creating&#13;
additional demudnd for labor; but by and large their benefits&#13;
visibly accrue to those who own land or assets that are&#13;
improved, and in proportion to their ownership.    Thus, where&#13;
land distribution is bimodal as in Pakistan the secondary&#13;
benefits are regressive in nature as they accentuate the in-&#13;
equity inherent in the ownership of rural assets; on the&#13;
other hand where the land distribution is more even, as in&#13;
Bangladesh, the secondary benefits may be more evenly shared&#13;
among landowners; however, the only benefits to the landless&#13;
are those from wages. An illustrative case analyzed for&#13;
Bangladesh showed that the returns to land (and hence land-&#13;
owners) reclaimed by public works projects are five times&#13;
higher than the returns to labor. 1/ It is of course possible&#13;
that some smallholders are among those receiving employment&#13;
(and hence in the target group) but still the relative rural&#13;
income distribution may not improve much if increased employ-&#13;
ment is all that accrues to target groups at which these&#13;
programs are aimed. The benefits from irrigation and drainage&#13;
projects are likely to be even more skewed.&#13;
Projects that emphasize economic infrastructure&#13;
(roads, reforestation, markets) tend to have the best redis-&#13;
trtbutive effects in the short run, as they are usually located&#13;
on public land. But again longer term benefits will accrue to&#13;
farmers (in proportion to the size of their holdings and more&#13;
importantly in relation to their marketable surplus) and perhaps&#13;
to traders and intermediaries providing farm inputs or buying&#13;
farm outputs. Perhaps increasing labor mobility and opening&#13;
remtote areas may assist the landless to move to areas of better&#13;
employment opportunities.&#13;
Social infrastructure projects (schools, clinics,&#13;
low-cost housing) can providean opportunity for improving the&#13;
social welfare of a broad range of the population. However,&#13;
actual benefits depend on who has access to the facilities.&#13;
Here the rural power structure probably prevents these benefits&#13;
from having a broad gauge effect.&#13;
To assure that benefits accrue to smallholders and&#13;
the landless may be feasible only where the land distribution&#13;
is unimodal or where small farmers are geographically separated.&#13;
But in South Asia where small and large holdings are physically&#13;
adjacent it will normally be impossible to direct most of the&#13;
longer term benefits to small farmers or the landless. The&#13;
1/ Burki, et.al., op.cit., p. 50.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 170 -&#13;
existing distribution of scarce resources, esgeciall' land,&#13;
is the single most important determinant of the flows of&#13;
non-wage benefits from works programs.&#13;
(9)  Most of the public works programs in South Asia have been subject&#13;
to political influence on both their original design as well as&#13;
in the course of implementation. The two most important factors&#13;
in bringing about what Burki, et.al. call program mutations are&#13;
(i) political objectives and commitments of the regimes under-&#13;
taking the programs, which are rarely articulated, and (ii) the&#13;
action of local elites who are in a good position to alter the&#13;
nature of ptublic works programs to serve their own interests.&#13;
There are several decision points at which these pressures for&#13;
mutation are applied.and these include (i) the choice of&#13;
projects, (ii) the choice oi technology, especially its labor&#13;
intensity, (iii) the choice of project implementation agent,&#13;
(iv) the establishment of wage rates, (v) the selection of&#13;
employees and 'vi) the location of the project. Pressures at&#13;
all these points may work to transfer benefits from target&#13;
groups to other intermediate, usually higher income, groups.&#13;
This has been particularly true in Pakistan where&#13;
the skewed distribution of land assets and political power has&#13;
assured a more rapid program mutation. In the PWP and RWP,&#13;
political loyalty rather than project performance became the&#13;
basis for public works allocations. "Large land owners, rural&#13;
contractors and small town tradesmen quickly shaped the program&#13;
to serve their own interests" by shifting the decisions from&#13;
the lowest level Union Councils to the much larger District&#13;
Councils controlled by these interests. The work was given to&#13;
contractors with a rapid decline in labor intensity and employ-&#13;
ment creation. 1/ As the programs were not backed by political&#13;
commitment to serve the poor, they deepened the cynicism on&#13;
part of the tenants, landless and other unemployed.&#13;
In Bangladesh, the more egalitarian rural structure&#13;
slowed the process of mutation so that the emergence of power&#13;
brokers and the reversal of broad participation in project deci-&#13;
sions and benefits took considerable time. But the greater&#13;
freedom for local governing bodies to make decisions and to&#13;
implement programs within a framework carefully structured by&#13;
the government has been one of the factors leading to greater&#13;
success of the WP in Bangladesh.&#13;
Before one reaches any conclusions about rural works programs, it&#13;
is useful to review the experience of the most recent effort in this&#13;
direction--the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme (MEGS).&#13;

B.   Maharashtra's Employment Guarantee Scheme 1/&#13;
An example of a public works program that is cited as being&#13;
successful, is Maharashtra's Employment Guarantee Scheme (MEGS).     The&#13;
Scheme was begun by Maharashtra's State Government in 1972 and consists&#13;
of a guarantee of employment to the rural poor including small and -&#13;
marginal farmers, landless agricultural workers and rural artisans. In&#13;
a country as large as India with pervasive conditions of unemployment and&#13;
underemployment in rural areas, a program that sets out to guarantee&#13;
employnent to its citizens is of enormous interest.&#13;
The Scheme aims to provide "gainful and productive employment--&#13;
gainful to the individual and productive to the economy--to all unskilled&#13;
persons in rural areas who need work and are prepared to do manual labor&#13;
but cannot find work on their own." Although the. scheme was begun in 1972,&#13;
it was engulfed by the large relief operations Launched to handle the&#13;
1972/74 drought.   Therefore the Scheme did not come into operation until&#13;
1974/75.&#13;
The main features of-the Scheme are as follows:&#13;
(1) the beneficiaries of the guarantee have no choice as to the type&#13;
of work on which they will be employed:&#13;
(2) the guarantees are given at the district level, i.e., guarantees&#13;
are given that work is provided within a radius of 5 kilometers of a village&#13;
where the laborers have registFed. If employment is to be provided more&#13;
than 5 kilometers away, then arrangements for campingrincluding hot portable&#13;
water, sanitary arrangements, first-aid facilities and ration shops,have&#13;
to be made;&#13;
(3)- work has to be provided within 15 days of it being demanded;&#13;
(4) work has to be provided for no less than between 15 to 30 days at&#13;
one stretch. (It is-not certain whether one can repeatedly register for&#13;
work once it has been obtained for 30 days, but presumably this is so.);&#13;
(5) works are undertaken departmentally and not through contractors.&#13;
At least 60% of the expenditures must be for wages to laborers. (This is&#13;
to avoid the criticism that public work programs often have spent their&#13;

benefits to those participating.);&#13;
(6)  wages are determined by piece rates calculated to ensure that&#13;
as far as possible a laborer working seven hours a day gets at least: Rs. 3.&#13;
Wages are paid on a weekly basis on "measurement" of outpue of work done.&#13;
(Further, it is supposed to ensure that those employed in agricultural&#13;
operations receive the minimum wage in agricultural prescribed by the State.);&#13;
(7)  works are chosen according to a particular set of priorit:ies&#13;
which include the completion of earlier works or the continuation of produc-&#13;
tive works of a labor-intensive nature which have a direct or indirect&#13;
effect on stimulating or expanding agricultural production. These in-&#13;
clude minor irrigation, water and soil conservation, comand area develop-&#13;
ment works, land development, flood controls, etc.    Only in areas where no&#13;
such,work is available is the construction of roads to be done; and&#13;
(8)  as far as possible the normal labor reguirments of on-farm work&#13;
and allied operations are sunDosed to be met before the MEGS becomes active&#13;
in any area.&#13;
Certain additional administrative features are incorporated in&#13;
the Scheme which make it unique. First, employment is ordered in a manner&#13;
such that emphasis is first given to existing works or incomplete works,&#13;
and only if such works are not available are new works to be started.&#13;
Secondly, in order to ensure efficient completion of works and the control&#13;
of overhead costs, regulations require that the size of the work as, far&#13;
as possible has to be such as to allow it to be completed within one or&#13;
two work seasons, (i.e., within the dry season of October to June). Only&#13;
works which can be completed at a cost of less than 4,000 mandays are to&#13;
be undertaken. Prior permission has to be obtained from the State Govern-&#13;
ment for larger works. Third, there is suppossd to be a blueprint for each&#13;
work which shows how it is spaced over a two-week work period. A man-&#13;
power budget for labor demand and supply is to be prepared at the block&#13;
level. 1/ Fourth, there is supposed to be a register of work seekers&#13;
which is used to forward requests for work to the block level where the&#13;
program is coordinated by the district collector who is in overall charge&#13;
of the MEGS.- The decision to place the collector in overall charge of the&#13;
MEGS reflects a smoldering dissatisfaction with the dominance of patronage&#13;
systems in the working of rural governments. Fifth, half of the budget&#13;
allocation for the MEGS is supposed to be met from the State's regular&#13;
planned budget and the other half from special taxation. Seventy one per-&#13;
cent of these tax revenues come from a surcharge on the sales tax and a&#13;
tax on professions; 21% come from a surcharge on land revenue imposed on&#13;
holdings of over three hectares; most of the balance comes from a special&#13;
cess on irrigated holdings (Table 4). Finally, each MEGS administration&#13;
l/ This is done in quantity terms, rather than in economic terms relating&#13;
the wage rates to quantities demanded and supplied.&#13;

quarterlv budget to provide flexibilitv to the management of the Scheme.&#13;
Table 5 shows the progress of the MECS in texms of expenditure&#13;
and employment generated. MEGS was supposed to provide about 140 miLlion&#13;
mandays per year. The highest working force employed in any one day has&#13;
been about 715,000; the lowest about l90000. The average daily attendance&#13;
during the peak period in December is between 400,000 and 450,000.&#13;
The employment impact has been massive when compared even with&#13;
the all India CSRE which generated only 178 million mandays over a 5-year&#13;
period. It is estimated that rural unemployment and underemployment in&#13;
Maharashtra is in the order of 620 million mandays annually. 1/ The&#13;
Scheme is therefore expected to generate employment for nearly a quarter&#13;
of the rural unemployed and underemployed on a scale hitherto unheard of.&#13;
The projections if realized would increase this proportion to nearly 35%. 2/&#13;
Further, the wage component of expenditures have been typically very high&#13;
--far above the levels previously experienced in public works programs&#13;
in South Asia--attesting to the labor intensity and employment emphasis of&#13;
the Scheme. Wage rates have been paid at or above the levels planned.&#13;
The Scheme was supposed to supplement plan and non-plan works,&#13;
but all'evidence indicates that it has been an initiator of works. More&#13;
than 5,000 works have been undertaken by the Scheme annually and there is&#13;
some concern that the rate of project completion may be reduced as a result&#13;
in the years ahead.&#13;
Another measure of the Scheme's overall impact could be obtained&#13;
from the additional area benefited by works undertaken and the additional&#13;
production and employment it has generated.    Some estimates are given in&#13;
Table 6. However, these are too unreliable and tentative to suggest: any con-&#13;
clusion except to say thateif they are to be accepted, the Scheme has not&#13;
had a substantial impact on agricultural production in the State. 3/&#13;
1/  Boah-Dwomoh, op.cit., p. 10.&#13;
2/  This may be impressive compared to other public works programs, but&#13;
it compares unfavorably with the 496 million mandays generated under&#13;
scarcity relief in 1973-74 in Maharashtra.&#13;
3/  These foodgrain production in Maharshtra in 1974-75 was 7.8 million tons.&#13;
The 225,000 tons expected additional product'on (we are assuming it is&#13;
foodgrains) from completed and incomplete projects over nearly 3 years&#13;
of operation amounts to 75,000 tons annually or less than 1% of total&#13;
annual production.&#13;

Although there have been problems in MEGS with project planning&#13;
and selection, a majority of expenditures can be classified in the&#13;
"directly productive" category. Table 7 shows the expenditure pattern&#13;
under the MEGS and the types of work undertaken. An interesting feature&#13;
is that between 80 to 90% of all expenditures have been on irrigatLon&#13;
works of one kind or another and soil and development schemes.     Although&#13;
there has been a slight shift in asset creation towards economic infra-&#13;
structuire, the emphasis has remained overwhelmingly on directly productive&#13;
works. Indeed this is one of the features that distinguishes MEGS from&#13;
past rural works programs in South Asia. (Compare with figures in&#13;
Table 3.) It will be interesting to see if this emphasis can be maintained, as&#13;

the potential for minor irrigation works seems likely to be&#13;
exhausted, and major and medium irrigation works which are harder to&#13;
plan will then have to be undertaken.&#13;
What about the financial implications of KEGS and its in-&#13;
flationary potential? The cost of financing the Scheme has been in-&#13;
creasing rapidly (Table 5). In 1977-78 the budgeted expenditures on&#13;
MEGS of Rs. 500 million accounted for nearly 8% of th@ total Haharashtra&#13;
plan outlays in the same year. 1/ These outleys are, however, projected&#13;
to nearly double by 1979/80. As more than half of the expenditures on&#13;
MEGS are provided by revenues from special tanes (nearly 70% of which in&#13;
turn are generated by a tax on professional incomes which comes mainly&#13;
from urban areas) 2/ the Scheme's inflationary iapact should be ainlmal&#13;
especially if deficit financing is avoided.    This will require a corres-&#13;
ponding reduction in other plan expenditures as KEGS outlays increase.&#13;
Although the first round inflationary potential of the Scheme as curgently&#13;
constituted appears small, the fact that most outleys are on wages and&#13;
that wage recipients are likely to have high umrginal propensities to&#13;
consume and high income elasticities for foodgrain consumption, suggests&#13;
that it could have a marked secondary on foodgrain prices. We have no&#13;
data on this aspect of the problem.&#13;
Of course MEGS has had problems. These include:&#13;
(1) Low completion rates of projects. Although detailed data are&#13;
unavailable, surveys made by the Joint Evaluation Study of the Program&#13;
Evaluation Organization (PEO) in eight talukas indicated "that 35% of&#13;
the works included in the master list have been completed but these accounted&#13;
for less than 7% of the-total value of works scheduled, indicating a pre-&#13;
dictably strong correlation between the size of the work and the speed of&#13;
completion." 3/ Factors delaying the completion of works have included&#13;
(a) inadequate provision of complementary inputs such as skilled laibor or&#13;
land acquisition, (b) lach of coatinuigy in work CoedUlingD (C) the&#13;
clustering of MEGS projects so they compete with eachi other for lidQ and&#13;
(d) interdepartmental or jurisdictional disputes.&#13;
(2) Inequitable Distribution of Benefits. The scheme has focussed&#13;
mainly on intermediate outputs--mandays of employment and asset creation--&#13;
rather than final benefits. Although the scheme was intended primarily&#13;
to benefit landless laborers and the lowest decile of landowners, preliminary&#13;
1/  As a proportion of plan expenditures KEGS has grown from 5% in 1974-75&#13;
to an anticipated 10% in 1976-77. These proportions may rise substan-&#13;
tially if the employment impact is to be maintained at the rate of&#13;
about 20% of the rural employment deficit.&#13;
2/ In fact the financing of the scheme represents an urban to rural&#13;
transfer.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
evidence indicates that only approximately 46% of the workers actually&#13;
come from t:hose groups--the remaining 54% come from owners of larger&#13;
holdings. I/ The large landowners have also benefitted from greater&#13;
asset creat:ion on their holdings, but one cannot see how this can be&#13;
avoided. (To the extent that these investments have increased the&#13;
demand for labor, the indirect distributional benefits are still&#13;
progressive.) 2/&#13;
(3) Planning and Selection of Projects. To date the MEGS has&#13;
benefitted from a backlog of unfinished projects--hence the almost&#13;
exclusive on minor irrigation (primarily percolation) and village tanks&#13;
and soil conservation.&#13;
The greatest weakness in the management of the MEGS may be the&#13;
inability of the development administration at the district and block&#13;
levels to prepare a large enough number of suitable new works once this&#13;
backlog is exhausted. They have been handicapped by limited capacity to&#13;
undertake physical surveys or to develop integrated projects. So far the&#13;
State has not been prepared to pay for preliminary work design. Secondly,&#13;
in many areas there is little scope for MEGS type work on public lands.&#13;
The development has to be on private lands. This is done under a loan&#13;
subsidy arrangement usually of 50% loan, 50% State subsidy. The develop-&#13;
ment of group financing of community wells, common field tanks, community&#13;
pastures and forest and land improvement tied to the Small Farmers Develop-&#13;
ment Agency (SFDA) and Marginal Farmers and Agricultural Labourers Develop-&#13;
ment Agency (MFALDA) programs is an important idea. The decision to allow&#13;
development of private land may, however, have other consequences. Farmers&#13;
who accept a loan component are likely to be the larger farmers having good&#13;
lands, well sited for the development of small irrigation sources. The&#13;
smallholders,,who will provide much of the labor under these schemes, are&#13;
likely to own lands away from irrigation sources. This would lead to an&#13;
ill-distribution of the assets created, as it already has.&#13;
In spite of these problems and shortcomings the MEGS is a bold&#13;
experiment which offers several lessons for the potential role of public&#13;
works programs in alleviating widespread rural unemployment--lessons that&#13;
are different from those learned from earlier experiences in South Asia.&#13;
1/ R. Grawe, op.cit., p. 7. This may be more an indication of the desperate&#13;
conditions in the rural areas of Maharashtra rather than of the failure&#13;
of the MEGS to reach its target groups.&#13;
2/  Minimum wage legislation may be also a factor.    There have been reports&#13;
bv farmers (my emphasis) that workers,prefer MEGS work to farm work&#13;
,even when hlgher vages are offered. Sut workees may preferltMGS Dot&#13;
for higher wages but for the opportunity it VWy provide to escape irk-&#13;
some and even degrading relations with farm employers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

These are:&#13;
, (1) Rural public works programs can be designed and administered&#13;
on a large scale with the primary objective of reducing long-term rural&#13;
unemployment. Further,if this is seen as their main goal they can have&#13;
a significant impact on long-term employment prospects in rural areas.&#13;
(2) Such programs if properly financed need not be inflationary&#13;
and can even serve as a means for urban-rural transfers.&#13;
(3) Such programs cannot succeed without the political commitment&#13;
to this employment creation goal at the highest levels. The MEGS :is a&#13;
bold acknowledgment of both the citizen's right to work as well as of the&#13;
nature of the crisis that exists in the countryside. The State's long&#13;
history of rural works program and the more recent successful management&#13;
of the Scarcity Relief Works on a large scale during the severe droughts&#13;
in 1973-74 are partly responsible for the enlivened attitudes and adminis-&#13;
trative commitments, but at the core the MEGS is a political commitment&#13;
to a strategy of rural development with a focus on rural employment and&#13;
rural asset creation designed to alleviate poverty. The only comparable&#13;
effort has been in the massive works programs carried out in the rural&#13;
areas of China. To do this on a statuary basis through a democrat:ic&#13;
and legislative process, by passing the Employw2nt Guarantee Bill, is a&#13;
measure of this intensive commitment. Without this commitment the MEGS&#13;
would not have succeeded even to the extent that it has. The MEGS is&#13;
also viewed by some as a social contract between the state and the citizen&#13;
wherein the issues of labor dignity, choice of work, group participation&#13;
and design and responsibility for timely execution of public works are&#13;
included. It can also be seen as a way of organizing rural labor over&#13;
the whole State. Some feel that the opportunity the MEGS provides to&#13;
organize labor on a massive scale in rural areas is its salient feature&#13;
while others have seen it as a first stop towardo the unionization of&#13;
rural labor.  But thoco cceaelzog -aso &#13;
(4)  Oa the physical sido tha       i   ane contribution of the 1ZGS&#13;
may be its adoption of the water-shed as the approgriate level for the&#13;
planning and management of rural development. It was felt that a stronger&#13;
economic community exists within the geographically vertical relationships&#13;
of a water-shed than within a village. Historically, this resulted from&#13;
the settlement of poorer groups successively up the water-shed while retain-&#13;
ing dependency relationships through labor, credit and marketing with power-&#13;
ful families in the bottom and original villages. A water-shed plan by&#13;
questioning the present land use patterns and attempting to act upon it&#13;
would necessitate a new relationship of the State to the community. Although&#13;
this is another facet of the social contract idea, its significance is far&#13;
more important for it offers for the first time the possibility of carrying&#13;
out a rural reform and development program in which three components usual.&#13;
thought of as separate and distinct--land consolidation, land-water develol&#13;
ment and rural public works for employment--can be jointly carried in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 181 -&#13;
svstems approach" advocated by Minhas (1970). 1/    Although MEGS does not&#13;
have a land consolidation program attached to it, its choice of the water-&#13;
shed for planning rural public works and its emphasis on irrigation and&#13;
soil rori.,ervatfott projeCts certainly contains the other two elements.&#13;
rhe geLiesis of the MEGS really lies in-earlier experiments to&#13;
design a strateg) of rural development with a focus on employment to&#13;
mitigate rural poverty. Even earlier schemes had been designed to improve&#13;
soil conservatioii in the State. This program had followed the denudation&#13;
of Maharashtra's forest land which led to erosion. This degradation of&#13;
agricultural land over at least half the State,compounded by the spread of&#13;
cultivation on to marginal lands, are important causes for the State's&#13;
poor past agricultuiral performance. Soil conservation programs were&#13;
mainly concenitrated on the formation of field bunds.   These ran into several&#13;
problems. Since most farmers have small plots of land distributed around&#13;
the village, and records of field' bunding for land under one village were&#13;
often kept in the books of two or more units, illiterate farmers were often&#13;
charged more than one pavment in a single year. In the absence of land&#13;
consolidation and in the context of an illiterate peasantry, the require-&#13;
ments of contour bunding were not very successful. Few farmers had fields&#13;
which were large enough to accommodate contour bunds without the formation&#13;
of small awkward triangles in the corners of the fields. Finally, the&#13;
maintenance of field bunds has been generally poor, because there has been&#13;
no concomitant improvement in crop husbandry that might produce quick and&#13;
evident results. Thus, only an integrated program of land consolidation,&#13;
introduction of rapid technological change, with HYVs and improved crop&#13;
practices tied to a program of irrigation and water development,makes any&#13;
sense. The means for accomplishing these ends lie partly with the rural&#13;
works program. Thus, reducing unemployment, increasing farm productivity&#13;
and efficiency and increasing the intensity of land use are all comple-&#13;
mentary elements in any scheme for attacking rural poverty. Maharashtra's&#13;
experience with the MEGS may be the first real chance to attempt such an&#13;
integrated approach. The stakes are too high not to attempt what is possible.&#13;
The question arises whether the MEGS can be replicated elsewhere&#13;
and whether national employment guarantee schemes can be undertaken. Any&#13;
decision on the replication of MEGS on a national scale would be premature&#13;
until: (1) Maharashtra has had a chance to use a guarantee of employment&#13;
to strengthen local decision making in management and (2) until the need&#13;
to move the scheme into the center of development administration is recog-&#13;
nized. A simple extrapolation of Maharashtra's experience suggests&#13;
costs of Rs. 8,330 million per year to run a nationwide KEGS or about 10%&#13;
of central and state annual plan outlays in the coming years. It is not&#13;
certain what the returns zo this program would be. A continuing problem&#13;

will be the design of useful works and the maintenance of assets over the&#13;
years; two key management hurdles which schemes like the MEGS must cross.&#13;
If similar MEGS were to be introduced in other states, where&#13;
should they be undertaken? Many of the Drought-Prone Areas Projects&#13;
districts suggest themselves. In such projects employment could be&#13;
guaranteed for a number of years to the community during which activities&#13;
were undertaken to husband and develop the watershed resources of a given&#13;
area. This program could be:tied to land consolidation. Such an experi-&#13;
mental approach and the experience gained from it in DPAP districts could&#13;
form the basis for a nationwide program, with its risks to the national&#13;
polity.&#13;
II.    CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Although Maharashtra's EGS, if instituted on a nationwide basis,&#13;
provides a glimmer of hope in partially alleviating the problems of&#13;
unemployment in South Asia, one cannot be too sanguine about the abiLlity&#13;
of rural public works programs to solve the long-term problems of unem-&#13;
ployment. Their cause is structural--too large a growth in the labor&#13;
fo9Cz) eoAhc2 with too slow a growth in the demand for labor in rural&#13;
areas. Rural-urban migration is not a solution, for it only displaces&#13;
the problem from the countryside to the cities. Semi-permanent labor&#13;
mobilization in rural areas on a scale that has been matched only by the&#13;
Pharoahs in Egypt and Mao in China, can and must be part of the answer.&#13;
The experience with rural work programs as a means for providing&#13;
employment in South Asia has been mixed.       Although they serve a very&#13;
useful purpose in the relief of sudden disasters, the salient fact is that&#13;
they have had only an insignificant impact on the magnitude of the rural&#13;
unemployient problem, except in very few cases and in a limited 1o?gional&#13;

work programs, the sheer magnitude of the task will continue to defeat their&#13;
purpose, if this purpose is to make substantial inroads into rural unemploy-&#13;

            Small farmers and the landless in South Asia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The majority of the world's poor
            are among the 625 million people who reside in the rural
            areas of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The rural poor
            consist predominantly of: (i) small owner and tenant
            cultivators with operational holdings of less than 5 acres
            (2 hectares); and (ii) the landless. There are approximately
            83 million households with a population of 410 million in
            these categories. This paper attempts to examine the
            prospects for improved livelihood for these households and
            the problems faced by them in the three major countries of
            South Asia. Improving the livelihood of small cultivators
            depends, in the absence of any major programs of land
            redistribution, upon improving their productivity. The
            availability of abundant family labor and cash scarcity
            suggests an initial concentration on labor-intensive methods
            to raise small farmer productivity through improved cultural
            practices. Further increases in productivity require
            multiple cropping, increased use of inputs--water,
            nutrients, pesticides--and the adoption of high-yielding
            varieties (HYVs). The paper examines both the prospects and
            the problems involved in pursuing these strategies.
