&#13;
             MR. WOLFENSOHN:   The usual pre-annual meeting&#13;
&#13;
 pressures are affecting the representations, but I am&#13;
&#13;
 delighted to have the first team here today to discuss the&#13;
&#13;
 Social Protection Sector Strategy:         From Safety Net to&#13;
&#13;
 Spring Board.&#13;
&#13;
             I see that is item two on the agenda.        What is&#13;
&#13;
 item one?    Item one is the approval of the minutes listed&#13;
&#13;
 on the agenda -- I am sorry -- June 15th, July 6th, July&#13;
&#13;
 11th, 13th, 18th and 27th.      And the absence of objection,&#13;
&#13;
 those minutes are approved.&#13;
&#13;
             Let me get now to item two, which is the Social&#13;
&#13;
 Protection Sector Strategy:      From Safety Net to Spring&#13;
&#13;
 Board.   And you will have seen the President's memorandum&#13;
&#13;
 on the subject submitted by Dr. Ramphele.           An earlier&#13;
&#13;
 draft of this paper was discussed by CODE on June 12th,&#13;
&#13;
 and a green sheet was issued on August 3rd.&#13;
&#13;
             I would like to acknowledge the statements by&#13;
&#13;
 Mmes. Bachmayer, Piercy and Messrs. Passacantando, Stek&#13;
&#13;
 and Wan Abdullah, which have been circulated in advance.&#13;
&#13;
             Let me ask Eduardo Doryan to make the&#13;
&#13;
 introductory remarks and then he will be followed by&#13;
&#13;
 Robert Holzmann who will talk at the beginning of your&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 discussion and Steen Jorgensen who will speak at the end&#13;
&#13;
 of the discussion on this subject.        And there are other&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues from the social group with us.&#13;
&#13;
           So, let me ask Eduardo to introduce the subject.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. DORYAN:   Thank you very much, indeed.&#13;
&#13;
           First, let me acknowledge that we have&#13;
&#13;
 representatives from all the regions because, as you well&#13;
&#13;
 know, this has been a product that has been built with&#13;
&#13;
 close coordination with our colleagues throughout the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, let me appreciate the comments that we&#13;
&#13;
 received in the last hours, excellent, and we are going to&#13;
&#13;
 acknowledge and deal with some of your suggestions and&#13;
&#13;
 questions.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me again put in context three specific&#13;
&#13;
 issues about the tradeoffs, the big tradeoffs that we&#13;
&#13;
 dealt with in building this social protection strategy.&#13;
&#13;
 And they took into account the need to be selective at the&#13;
&#13;
 time to build these tradeoffs.      What are those three major&#13;
&#13;
 tradeoffs?&#13;
&#13;
           The first one -- and we asked ourselves this&#13;
&#13;
 question -- was, if the strategy was what we could call&#13;
&#13;
 the minimum common denominator of what conceptually and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 operationally we knew, or we should push the conceptual&#13;
&#13;
 framework to be the state of the art in dealing with these&#13;
&#13;
 issues, and at the same time, not only be conceptually&#13;
&#13;
 robust but operationally relevant.&#13;
&#13;
           In this case, the latter was the decision.        And&#13;
&#13;
 it is not only a balancing act between -- and there were&#13;
&#13;
 some comments that you sent yesterday mentioning these --&#13;
&#13;
 it is not only a balancing act between advocacy and&#13;
&#13;
 operational issues, but between robust conceptual thinking&#13;
&#13;
 and operational relevance.&#13;
&#13;
           So, indeed, that is a difficult task and we&#13;
&#13;
 think that the strategy deals with it.         It will be also&#13;
&#13;
 some time a living document.      Thus, the idea of reporting&#13;
&#13;
 back in a year's time is a good one, and we welcome it&#13;
&#13;
 very much.&#13;
&#13;
           The second point is that the strategy could be -&#13;
&#13;
 - and that was the second tradeoff -- where a set of other&#13;
&#13;
 issues, not yet fully addressed in all strategies, should&#13;
&#13;
 be put.   Using this very strong conceptual underpinning of&#13;
&#13;
 the social risk management, does the strategy focus on one&#13;
&#13;
 area of thinking and policy such as social protection?&#13;
&#13;
 The latter was the case.    That means we tried to narrow at&#13;
&#13;
 the end the focus to social protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           However, this strategy is very much imbedded and&#13;
&#13;
 it is very closely linked to the CDF framework, to&#13;
&#13;
 community-driven development and to the PRSP poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategies.    But the Bank cannot include in&#13;
&#13;
 large scope all the things because of the specific task of&#13;
&#13;
 social protection that was our terms of reference.        So,&#13;
&#13;
 financial vulnerability, governance issues, informal&#13;
&#13;
 sector issues, et cetera, these issues are recognized, put&#13;
&#13;
 in a broader context, but the paper still tried to be at&#13;
&#13;
 the end a social protection strategy.         And that has been&#13;
&#13;
 the focus.   And obviously, it is not easy to be selective&#13;
&#13;
 and focused in areas such as this.&#13;
&#13;
           The third tradeoff:      Does the strategy in one&#13;
&#13;
 area, social protection, takes sides from the beginning in&#13;
&#13;
 favor of a subset of instruments and institutions or does&#13;
&#13;
 it seek to identify the most appropriate mix based on each&#13;
&#13;
 country's context?   The latter is the case, as you well&#13;
&#13;
 know, where informal, market-based and public policy&#13;
&#13;
 interventions are addressed under the lens of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           The word "spring board" that is in the title is&#13;
&#13;
 intended to show the dynamics of creating inclusive&#13;
&#13;
 societies that can prevent, mitigate and cope with risks,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 and that can be organized to do so.        It deals with the&#13;
&#13;
 social fabric to deal with vulnerability as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
           Robert, if you would like to address other&#13;
&#13;
 concerns that were put forward in the last couple of days.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. HOLZMANN:    Thank you, Eduardo.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. President, distinguished Board:        It is with&#13;
&#13;
 great pleasure, pride and also some relief that I am&#13;
&#13;
 making this opening statement.      The preparation of this&#13;
&#13;
 sector strategy paper has occupied the sector and other&#13;
&#13;
 groups within the Bank for the last two years.        These were&#13;
&#13;
 productive years and I would like to thank everybody&#13;
&#13;
 involved to make this a good product:         the Board, you,&#13;
&#13;
 through your encouragement, feedback, questions and&#13;
&#13;
 critique at CODE and technical meetings and also in direct&#13;
&#13;
 interactions; senior management and other sectors in the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank for intellectual input and guidance and, of course,&#13;
&#13;
 the family for Social Protection in the region and the&#13;
&#13;
 anchor that took fully this occasion to think through SP&#13;
&#13;
 issues in an innovative way and to establish this young&#13;
&#13;
 Bank sector inside and outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           In my opening remarks I would like to make three&#13;
&#13;
 short comments.   One on the definition and the underlying&#13;
&#13;
 concept -- social risk management, one on the process and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 one on the strategic conclusions, addressing thereby the&#13;
&#13;
 main comments we received during the night.&#13;
&#13;
            On the definition and the concept:        Here SP is a&#13;
&#13;
 young family within the Bank.      It was coming together only&#13;
&#13;
 in 1997.   And it has been traditionally defined as labor&#13;
&#13;
 market interventions, social insurance and social safety&#13;
&#13;
 nets.   And it also is based on the goals set out in&#13;
&#13;
 Copenhagen, but these goals as well as tradition, we&#13;
&#13;
 consider this insufficient to base a strategy on it which&#13;
&#13;
 should be, on the one hand, operational but, on the other&#13;
&#13;
 hand, provide a breakthrough in our fight and thinking&#13;
&#13;
 about poverty.&#13;
&#13;
            And for this reason, the new conceptual&#13;
&#13;
 framework was developed which includes what is&#13;
&#13;
 traditionally understood but goes beyond.          It takes&#13;
&#13;
 account of a dynamic view of poverty which is linked with&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability and risk.    It sees the poor as much more&#13;
&#13;
 exposed to diverse risks while at the same time having the&#13;
&#13;
 least instruments to management them.         And it addresses&#13;
&#13;
 the causes as well as the symptoms of risk in order to&#13;
&#13;
 reduce poverty in a sustainable manner.&#13;
&#13;
            On the process, the sector strategy paper was&#13;
&#13;
 and is the result of an interactive process between the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 networks, the regional staff and all other Bank sectors&#13;
&#13;
 and partners inside and outside the Bank over the last 24&#13;
&#13;
 months.&#13;
&#13;
           Close cooperation and interaction took place&#13;
&#13;
 with the Poverty Board, Social Development and Gender&#13;
&#13;
 Boards, and they received all the drafts presented them.&#13;
&#13;
 And in one of the comments raised by Jan Piercy, the&#13;
&#13;
 Gender Board comments or the revision we did after your&#13;
&#13;
 suggestion at the CODE meeting, they were based on inputs&#13;
&#13;
 from the Gender Board and cleared with them.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, the preparation coincided fortunately&#13;
&#13;
 with the WDR 2000.    Those writers held very close&#13;
&#13;
 interaction, as you can see it, that social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management is the centerpiece after opportunity and&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
           Thirdly, the concept was developed in close&#13;
&#13;
 interaction in a constant interaction between the anchor&#13;
&#13;
 and the regions, which means that the regions have&#13;
&#13;
 elaborated their own regional sector strategy paper, all&#13;
&#13;
 of which are essentially ready, which then fed back into&#13;
&#13;
 the strategy paper.&#13;
&#13;
           And last but not least, we consulted widely with&#13;
&#13;
 our international partners, just to mention a few, the&#13;

 Commission for Social Development of the UN, UNICEF, ILO,&#13;
&#13;
 UNDP and bilateral donors, DFID, GTZ, at French&#13;
&#13;
 authorities, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
           The last point on the strategic conclusions.&#13;
&#13;
 The sector strategy paper comes out with a number of&#13;
&#13;
 important conclusions.    Most importantly, it establishes&#13;
&#13;
 social protection and social risk management both as a&#13;
&#13;
 theme as well as sector.    As a theme it requires close&#13;
&#13;
 interaction with other sectors to work with them how they&#13;
&#13;
 can make investment, how they can make policy which have a&#13;
&#13;
 social policy content.&#13;
&#13;
           As a sector, it requires a rethinking and&#13;
&#13;
 reorientation of some of the work we have been doing,&#13;
&#13;
 including thinking about non-contributory system for the&#13;
&#13;
 elderly poor, thinking about unemployment benefits beyond&#13;
&#13;
 unemployment insurance, and thinking of safety nets which&#13;
&#13;
 not only provide coping but also risk mitigation effects.&#13;
&#13;
           In terms of the strategic directions, several&#13;
&#13;
 important issues were brought up in the written&#13;
&#13;
 statements, for example, by Ruth Bachmayer.        On the&#13;
&#13;
 pension reform, we completely agree that sound financial&#13;
&#13;
 and governance system is essential for a successful&#13;
&#13;
 pension reform as in all other social programs, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 pension reform is done in interaction with groups in the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank but also with the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
           On proactive labor market policies, we conducted&#13;
&#13;
 reviews of existing evaluation and they showed that active&#13;
&#13;
 labor market policies are only effective and efficient if&#13;
&#13;
 they are targeted to a sub-group.       Currently, we don't&#13;
&#13;
 have yet the evidence that large-scale active labor market&#13;
&#13;
 policies are effective.    So, we think we have to do more&#13;
&#13;
 evaluation and more interaction with other institutions'&#13;
&#13;
 work in this area before we launch a large-scale approach.&#13;
&#13;
           Last but not least, as regards social funds, we&#13;
&#13;
 have done sound evaluations using households and community&#13;
&#13;
 surveys, so we know that they can provide good services to&#13;
&#13;
 poor communities within this currently limited mandate.&#13;
&#13;
 The important part of the social protection portfolio is&#13;
&#13;
 active in more than 50 developing countries.       So, we felt&#13;
&#13;
 the potential role ought to be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
           We do recognize that there are weaknesses, the&#13;
&#13;
 issue of bypassing government structures, the need for&#13;
&#13;
 transparency, et cetera, but since they do exist and have&#13;
&#13;
 been proven largely effective, we felt it is important to&#13;
&#13;
 address the role they could play as a complement but not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 as a substitute for government programs.           We especially&#13;
&#13;
 felt they could play a role piloting new approaches.&#13;
&#13;
           We look forward for more discussion in this area&#13;
&#13;
 in the update of our strategy paper.&#13;
&#13;
           Ladies and gentlemen of the Board:          With this&#13;
&#13;
 sector strategy paper, the sector has attempted to move&#13;
&#13;
 social protection into the core of the development debate&#13;
&#13;
 and at the center of our poverty mission.          With this&#13;
&#13;
 paper, we consider our work only at the beginning and more&#13;
&#13;
 needs to be done in the coming years.         And there was a&#13;
&#13;
 suggestion raised that there should be an update in one&#13;
&#13;
 year's time; I think it is a very good one.&#13;
&#13;
           Yet, we are confident that the new strategic&#13;
&#13;
 door has been opened and we are looking forward to the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me call first on Anna Brandt.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. BRANDT:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           We very much welcome this strategy paper and&#13;
&#13;
 dealing with a theme that we think is extremely important.&#13;
&#13;
 We also strongly support the increasing emphasis on social&#13;
&#13;
 protection as a key component of fighting poverty and we&#13;
&#13;
 strongly encourage the Bank to continue along this path.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            We support the main thrust of the SSP, including&#13;
&#13;
 the widened concept of social protection.           And in this&#13;
&#13;
 respect, we particularly welcome the increased emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
 social protection interventions as a means of getting out&#13;
&#13;
 of poverty and for upward mobility rather than simply as a&#13;
&#13;
 means to escape destitution.       That means regarding social&#13;
&#13;
 protection interventions more as investments than as&#13;
&#13;
 costs.&#13;
&#13;
            We have really appreciated the consultations&#13;
&#13;
 that we have had with the team during the process of&#13;
&#13;
 developing this strategy paper, especially the interesting&#13;
&#13;
 discussion we had in CODE in June and the following&#13;
&#13;
 discussion on the regional strategies in July.          I think&#13;
&#13;
 this has been very helpful, and we would like to thank the&#13;
&#13;
 authors for the openness they have shown towards the Board&#13;
&#13;
 in this respect.&#13;
&#13;
            We also believe that a number of improvements&#13;
&#13;
 have been made in this strategy over the course of this&#13;
&#13;
 process.   And I would just like to highlight a few changes&#13;
&#13;
 that we have particularly appreciated.&#13;
&#13;
            I think the revised version shows an expansion&#13;
&#13;
 of the stock-taking exercise and the analysis of past&#13;
&#13;
 performance.   And I think that is very useful.         It is also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 clear that this is a Bank-wide strategy that all of senior&#13;
&#13;
 management stands behind and that various relevant&#13;
&#13;
 departments have been involved in the process, which we&#13;
&#13;
 appreciate.&#13;
&#13;
             We also very much appreciate the increased&#13;
&#13;
 attention that has been given to the gender aspects of&#13;
&#13;
 social protection in the revised version.            I think now we&#13;
&#13;
 see gender aspects being mainstreamed in this SSP, which&#13;
&#13;
 we really think is very good.&#13;
&#13;
             We also appreciate the linkages that have been&#13;
&#13;
 made to the social principles.        I think this is also an&#13;
&#13;
 important aspect.&#13;
&#13;
             Since our CODE discussion, a number of other&#13;
&#13;
 things have also happened that we welcome.           We welcome the&#13;
&#13;
 fact that social protection now forms a very important&#13;
&#13;
 part of the WDR on Poverty, and that also social&#13;
&#13;
 protection is included in the Bank's agenda clearly in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of our work concerning the international financial&#13;
&#13;
 architecture.&#13;
&#13;
             In addition, I would like to offer the following&#13;
&#13;
 comments.    We support the special emphasis in the SSP that&#13;
&#13;
 is being given to developing methods and tools for&#13;
&#13;
 mainstreaming social protection, cutting across all Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 sectors and programs.    And this particularly includes&#13;
&#13;
 developing methods to ensure integration of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection into our country programs and into the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 process, to reduce vulnerabilities and improve&#13;
&#13;
 opportunities of the poor for better risk management.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we would even argue for a more proactive&#13;
&#13;
 approach by the Bank in terms of stressing the importance&#13;
&#13;
 of social protection.    We would also argue more broadly&#13;
&#13;
 for inclusion of social protection components in all&#13;
&#13;
 adjustment lending.   And we feel that this is especially&#13;
&#13;
 important in terms of our operations in Sub-Saharan&#13;
&#13;
 Africa.   And we sincerely hope that conditions would allow&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank to expand its activities over time in this region&#13;
&#13;
 when it comes to social protection.&#13;
&#13;
           Now poor people are more exposed to risk and&#13;
&#13;
 have less access to effective risk management instruments.&#13;
&#13;
 Thus, we feel the focus should primarily be on instruments&#13;
&#13;
 that are achievable for the poor.       And in that context,&#13;
&#13;
 the appropriate balance between public, market and&#13;
&#13;
 community-based arrangements should be found.&#13;
&#13;
           And the question of public versus market-based&#13;
&#13;
 interventions is discussed in the SSP.         But I think we&#13;
&#13;
 would still like to see clearer language on the need to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 promote a certain level of minimum provisions of public&#13;
&#13;
 services for social protection.        This is something we&#13;
&#13;
 raised at CODE and I think it is something that my&#13;
&#13;
 constituency feels strongly for.        So, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
 emphasize this again.     And we do think that the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
 its policy dialogue with clients should emphasize this as&#13;
&#13;
 a government responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
           And while we agree that existing public sector&#13;
&#13;
 programs must be rethinked, this might we feel in many&#13;
&#13;
 cases rather imply that they should be improved and&#13;
&#13;
 strengthened than be transferred to private providers.&#13;
&#13;
 And I think linked to this is, of course, addressing&#13;
&#13;
 capacity constraints, the efficiency of service delivery,&#13;
&#13;
 the absence of corruption and sound public management.&#13;
&#13;
 And these issues were very clearly identified by the poor&#13;
&#13;
 themselves in the Voices of the Poor study as being&#13;
&#13;
 crucial for reducing risk and improving security.       So,&#13;
&#13;
 these are issues that we feel still should be expanded&#13;
&#13;
 upon in the SSP.&#13;
&#13;
           We do welcome the emphasis on the development of&#13;
&#13;
 new tools through pilot activities, and we encourage&#13;
&#13;
 strong collaboration with other development partners in&#13;
&#13;
 these pilots, including partners providing grant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 assistance.   And we note that the intentions to reassess&#13;
&#13;
 partnerships focusing the Bank's engagement in areas of&#13;
&#13;
 comparative advantage and to work closely with other&#13;
&#13;
 partners to develop new products based on comparative&#13;
&#13;
 strength and synergies, this is very welcome.&#13;
&#13;
           Like our U.S. and Dutch colleagues in their&#13;
&#13;
 written statements, we also feel that the paper is a bit&#13;
&#13;
 over-optimistic on its assessment of the impact of social&#13;
&#13;
 funds.   And I heard Robert's comments just now.    In spite&#13;
&#13;
 of that, we feel that we need to be a bit more careful in&#13;
&#13;
 our language on social funds.      We think that targeting has&#13;
&#13;
 been a serious problem in low-income countries with weak&#13;
&#13;
 administrative capacities.     And while social funds may&#13;
&#13;
 clearly have a role to play in efforts to reduce&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability of the poor, a lot remains to be done in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of improving targeting through involving and&#13;
&#13;
 properly organizing local communities.&#13;
&#13;
           So, we feel that we need a bit more of a&#13;
&#13;
 balanced view on social funds and that we should proceed&#13;
&#13;
 with caution in this area.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, a couple of remarks on format and&#13;
&#13;
 presentation.   We feel that the distinction in the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy made between the reducing and mitigating and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 coping elements of social risk management are a bit&#13;
&#13;
 exaggerated and that we would benefit from having more of&#13;
&#13;
 a discussion of the potential synergies of integrating&#13;
&#13;
 these three dimensions into one single approach.     So, that&#13;
&#13;
 is one general comment.&#13;
&#13;
             And then in terms of presentation, I think&#13;
&#13;
 although there is an extremely large amount of information&#13;
&#13;
 in the SSP, and I understand the need to bring a lot of&#13;
&#13;
 elements together, it does result in a somewhat bulky&#13;
&#13;
 document.    I understand also that the comments from the&#13;
&#13;
 Board during the process hasn't really helped because we&#13;
&#13;
 have usually been asking you to add things and not to take&#13;
&#13;
 away things.    But I think it poses the question on how we&#13;
&#13;
 want these SSPs to look.      And I think we might benefit&#13;
&#13;
 from a somewhat slimmer product with a clearer main&#13;
&#13;
 message.&#13;
&#13;
             And I think this is something that we would like&#13;
&#13;
 to discuss in a more general context when we do the SSP&#13;
&#13;
 stock-taking exercise.     So, we are very much looking&#13;
&#13;
 forward to that.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. WOLFENSOHN:   Thank you very much for a very&#13;

           Mr. Venghaus.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. VENGHAUS:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I welcome the discussion about the social&#13;
&#13;
 protection sector strategy and want to commend staff for&#13;
&#13;
 this elaborated document.     I concur with the general&#13;
&#13;
 direction of the strategy and its new focus on social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management.   It looks like a useful and more adequate&#13;
&#13;
 framework to face the social protection needs of the&#13;
&#13;
 people, especially the poor in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
           We see the new sector strategy in line with the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP strategy and as part of the process which has been&#13;
&#13;
 started at the Social Summit in Copenhagen.        Nevertheless,&#13;
&#13;
 in addition, I have five specific comments to make.&#13;
&#13;
           First, the focus on social risk management is&#13;
&#13;
 promising because it widens the spectrum of the existing&#13;
&#13;
 institutional limitations, but more precision is needed.&#13;
&#13;
 For instance, the question how risks could be evaluated&#13;
&#13;
 and measured needs to be adequately addressed.       Otherwise,&#13;
&#13;
 it will be difficult to assess the effectiveness of the&#13;
&#13;
 different forms of risk management.&#13;
&#13;
           In addition, also the financing of social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management through the internal mobilization of resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 like, for instance, reforms of tax and distribution&#13;
&#13;
 policies remains mainly unaddressed in the paper.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, informal systems are very important&#13;
&#13;
 tools and widely important in developing countries for the&#13;
&#13;
 management of social risks.     Therefore, we welcome that&#13;
&#13;
 also the Bank shares this view.       But still one category of&#13;
&#13;
 social protection systems is left out in the paper, namely&#13;
&#13;
 cooperative solidarity systems.       Those systems show more&#13;
&#13;
 formal aspects than pure informal systems but are, on the&#13;
&#13;
 other hand, not typically market-based, as they include&#13;
&#13;
 elements of cooperative solidarity.        They are generally&#13;
&#13;
 often summarized as a third sector and should be part of&#13;
&#13;
 the sector strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           Third point, similarly problems at the&#13;
&#13;
 institutional level are widely spelled out.        Aspects of&#13;
&#13;
 institutional coordination and the distribution of&#13;
&#13;
 competencies between the national, regional and communal&#13;
&#13;
 level become especially problematic in the area of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection.   Therefore, questions about coordination and&#13;
&#13;
 cooperation on policy issues are, so to speak, the&#13;
&#13;
 political fine-tuning which should be addressed in the&#13;
&#13;
 paper.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Fourth, we also see social funds as a useful&#13;
&#13;
 instrument in the general framework of social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management.    Because of its demand-driven participatory&#13;
&#13;
 approach, they are adequate tools to directly reach out to&#13;
&#13;
 the poor and reduce poverty.       On the other hand, social&#13;
&#13;
 funds should be seen as one out of several useful&#13;
&#13;
 instruments.    And I agree with the Dutch and the Nordic&#13;
&#13;
 chair on this issue.    When the paper suggests the&#13;
&#13;
 extension of areas of involvement of social funds, this&#13;
&#13;
 would also imply the need for new instruments within these&#13;
&#13;
 institutions.   This inherits a danger to raise unrealistic&#13;
&#13;
 expectations about what social funds can actually achieve.&#13;
&#13;
           Before taking any further steps in this area, I&#13;
&#13;
 would recommend to wait for the results of the ongoing OED&#13;
&#13;
 study on social funds.     In this respect, Annex E lists&#13;
&#13;
 several new terms like, for instance, earmarked prepaid&#13;
&#13;
 multi-risk protection funds or the expansion of social&#13;
&#13;
 funds to promote positive informal insurance methods which&#13;
&#13;
 lack further explanation.&#13;
&#13;
           Furthermore, speaking about social funds and&#13;
&#13;
 partnerships, we are somewhat surprised to find a list of&#13;
&#13;
 bilateral donors in paragraph 10 of Annex D but not&#13;
&#13;
 considering, for instance, the vast experience and strong&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

 involvement in cofinancing with the World Bank of social&#13;
&#13;
 funds of the German Finance Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
           And finally, as the Dutch and Nordic chairs&#13;
&#13;
 again, I want to commend staff for mainstreaming gender.&#13;
&#13;
 At the last CODE meeting also this chair had criticized&#13;
&#13;
 the insufficient consideration of gender in this strategy.&#13;
&#13;
 But now it seems that a lot of effort has been put into&#13;
&#13;
 this matter and with good results.&#13;
&#13;
           And let me add one aspect on a personal note,&#13;
&#13;
 for me it is still an open question which influences these&#13;
&#13;
 sector strategy papers that they can and will have on a&#13;
&#13;
 day-to-day operational basis for a Task Manager.    I spoke&#13;
&#13;
 to several here in the Bank and it is very bulky, as it&#13;
&#13;
 was said, 130 pages, and how to bring that in an&#13;
&#13;
 operational level and also the other sector strategy&#13;
&#13;
 papers we have and to bring all of this together to a Task&#13;
&#13;
 Manager with very limited time seems to be quite an&#13;
&#13;
 achievement really and hard work.&#13;

&#13;
             I subscribe to most of what Anna Brandt has said&#13;
&#13;
 and I will focus on the critics more.          I think the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy of the CDF is correct and it is a good taxonomy&#13;
&#13;
 to look at all angles of poverty and vulnerability, but I&#13;
&#13;
 think too broad in scope because they deal even with&#13;
&#13;
 health and education and everything.         And I think the&#13;
&#13;
 field of health and education strategies to be dealt with&#13;
&#13;
 in detail and, on the other hand, it is too narrow an&#13;
&#13;
 approach.    I don't know why you stick to the risk&#13;
&#13;
 management approach because, of course, everything is&#13;
&#13;
 risky in life, but some things are more risky and some are&#13;
&#13;
 less risky.    You should broaden your approach, not just&#13;
&#13;
 focus on risk management.      Probably you are very&#13;
&#13;
 optimistic about this approach and this is a new approach&#13;
&#13;
 and all of that, but you should broaden your approach.&#13;
&#13;
             And I have just two specific points.       One is&#13;
&#13;
 related to the social funds.       This is an observation that&#13;
&#13;
 is not from the staff point of view, not from the client&#13;
&#13;
 point of view but kind of objective.         I think there are&#13;
&#13;
 perverse incentives for social funds' creation and&#13;
&#13;
 implementation in our countries, because on one side the&#13;
&#13;
 staff is willing to do projects and, on the other hand,&#13;
&#13;
 the client, the government is willing to spend money for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 the poor in a fast way, not, for example, to do reforms in&#13;
&#13;
 education and health that are tougher but to give money to&#13;
&#13;
 the poor.&#13;
&#13;
             And this has been used too many times&#13;
&#13;
 politically and not well targeted.         And the results of the&#13;
&#13;
 social funds, I have seen some evaluations and they are&#13;
&#13;
 not good.    I don't know how you are going to solve these&#13;
&#13;
 problems with social funds but you should be careful in&#13;
&#13;
 implementing social funds.&#13;
&#13;
             Moreover, I have seen in some of the countries&#13;
&#13;
 of my constituency that social funds do lots of social&#13;
&#13;
 infrastructure, are demand-driven and all of that, but&#13;
&#13;
 after the project finishes and gets excellent ratings from&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank, there is no sustainability for the building.&#13;
&#13;
 So, the things that you rate and all of that, nobody&#13;
&#13;
 follows up after the Bank project is finished.&#13;
&#13;
             In addition to that, as this is very appealing&#13;
&#13;
 for staff and for the client, this thing crowds out the&#13;
&#13;
 reforms in education and health.        That is the most&#13;
&#13;
 problematic area that we have to address head-on.          That is&#13;
&#13;
 one point.&#13;
&#13;
             The second point is related to labor markets.&#13;
&#13;
 In your strategy you are dealing with labor standards, to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 implement labor standards.     This is good in theory but bad&#13;
&#13;
 in practice because if you look at the developing&#13;
&#13;
 countries, most of the labor markets are informal and the&#13;
&#13;
 main issue is not to form labor standards in informal&#13;
&#13;
 markets that are more than 50 or 60 percent of the labor&#13;
&#13;
 force.   The issue is to deregulate the formal markets in&#13;
&#13;
 order to include all the informal markets in a more&#13;
&#13;
 deregulated labor market.&#13;
&#13;
           And specifically, this is very important in the&#13;
&#13;
 public sector labor markets.      For example, the most&#13;
&#13;
 inflexible labor markets are in health and education in&#13;
&#13;
 most of our countries.&#13;

           At the outset, I want to say that we found very&#13;
&#13;
 interesting and support this paper in the sense that this&#13;
&#13;
 is a first step in a crucial but relatively new sector for&#13;
&#13;
 the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           We would like to commend staff for the excellent&#13;
&#13;
 work they have done so far and look forward to having&#13;
&#13;
 further opportunities to make this strategy evolve since&#13;

 it is presented as a living document.          And we very much&#13;
&#13;
 appreciate that.&#13;
&#13;
           Having said that, I would like to share a few&#13;
&#13;
 questions and comments we still have on this paper.         And&#13;
&#13;
 we would appreciate our understanding to be confirmed on&#13;
&#13;
 several points which are critical to us.&#13;
&#13;
           This is the first sector strategy paper of the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank in social protection.        So, we believe it has to&#13;
&#13;
 be the strategy of the entire World Bank Group and not&#13;
&#13;
 only a paper from the Social Protection Sector Board.&#13;
&#13;
 More precisely, we would like to know how the region but&#13;
&#13;
 also the other sectors and networks, namely PREM and ESSD,&#13;
&#13;
 have both the social risk management concept, and what&#13;
&#13;
 could be the organizational and operational consequences&#13;
&#13;
 of the mainstreaming of such a new concept.         We wonder how&#13;
&#13;
 all the parties in the Bank involved in social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management will work together.&#13;
&#13;
           On partnership, we think the strategy is in line&#13;
&#13;
 with the results of the World Social Summit held in&#13;
&#13;
 Geneva.   We are very happy to see several references, and&#13;
&#13;
 for us it is all the more important to reach an agreement&#13;
&#13;
 between the World Bank and the ILO on the main elements of&#13;
&#13;
 their respective strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           We think the strategy could be further discussed&#13;
&#13;
 with the IMF too, if necessary, since social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management has a macro and financial dimension.&#13;
&#13;
           We welcome the new framework, namely social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management.   In fact, we think that this paper is a little&#13;
&#13;
 bit different from a strategy.      It provides a concept and&#13;
&#13;
 method of analysis through this concept -- a framework&#13;
&#13;
 consisting of a set of matrices to apply to the specific&#13;
&#13;
 situations of each country in order to reach the most&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate combination.&#13;
&#13;
           So, one could be satisfied in having such a tool&#13;
&#13;
 instead of a blueprint.    Others could feel frustrated for&#13;
&#13;
 not having a kind of more directive strategy.      But this is&#13;
&#13;
 probably due to the fact that social protection is&#13;
&#13;
 relatively new at the Bank and justifies that this paper&#13;
&#13;
 must be a living document.     And we very much welcome the&#13;
&#13;
 introductory remarks.&#13;
&#13;
           We have no problem with the definition of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection.   We understand that social protection&#13;
&#13;
 encompasses social risk management, redistribution and&#13;
&#13;
 social inclusion and even can be extended to the social&#13;
&#13;
 rights' approach of social policy.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           If so, this is the definition which actually can&#13;
&#13;
 fit our own conception of social policy, depending on the&#13;
&#13;
 combination of the various elements.        But in order to make&#13;
&#13;
 sure we understood well, we would appreciate staff to tell&#13;
&#13;
 us if this definition of social protection and the&#13;
&#13;
 European conception or tradition of social policy is well&#13;
&#13;
 compatible.&#13;
&#13;
           With regard to the main guiding principles, we&#13;
&#13;
 just have to say that we are quite happy with them since&#13;
&#13;
 they reflect a balanced and pragmatic approach, contrary&#13;
&#13;
 to an ideological one where some could have feared&#13;
&#13;
 dogmatic all market-based type approach.           We particularly&#13;
&#13;
 appreciate that the strategy recognizes with no hesitation&#13;
&#13;
 the role of the government in social protection as well as&#13;
&#13;
 the necessity of involving the stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
           However, we still believe that the strategy&#13;
&#13;
 appears to be too cautious on core labor standards, the&#13;
&#13;
 expression that the paper uses I think only once,&#13;
&#13;
 preferring basic labor standards.       We think that private&#13;
&#13;
 or market-based standards established by stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
 cannot replace public labor standards.         The risk of labor&#13;
&#13;
 market rigidities cannot prevent governments from taking&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 at the appropriate pace the legal steps toward core labor&#13;
&#13;
 standards.&#13;
&#13;
           We think the World Bank should not approach&#13;
&#13;
 issues surrounding labor standards on a too much pragmatic&#13;
&#13;
 and country-by-country basis.      There are principles in&#13;
&#13;
 social policies that the World Bank should strive to&#13;
&#13;
 implement with its member countries.&#13;
&#13;
           In child labor, we concur that the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
 should follow the lead of ILO and UNICEF, but we are not&#13;
&#13;
 clear, as other speakers mentioned, whether it is&#13;
&#13;
 necessary to set up a new Global Children's Initiative&#13;
&#13;
 Fund.&#13;
&#13;
           We appreciate that the World Bank states that&#13;
&#13;
 there is no blueprint for pension reform and the work&#13;
&#13;
 program described in paragraph 145 seems interesting.&#13;
&#13;
 However, we believe that it is very important to emphasize&#13;
&#13;
 the role of publicly managed systems and their social&#13;
&#13;
 cohesion role between and among generations.&#13;
&#13;
           On social funds, I share the remarks expressed&#13;
&#13;
 by other speakers and in several written statements.     We&#13;
&#13;
 are looking forward to the lessons from the OED work on&#13;
&#13;
 social funds.&#13;

&#13;
             Finally, we cannot help being struck by Table&#13;
&#13;
 1.3, page 70 related to Countries of Emphasis.       We don't&#13;
&#13;
 know if it such a conservation of interest on ECA and LCR&#13;
&#13;
 is acceptable.    A region such as Africa we believe should&#13;
&#13;
 deserve more attention.       I think also the strategy could&#13;
&#13;
 have elaborated more upon the impact of HIPC and PRSP as&#13;
&#13;
 an opportunity for the development of social protection,&#13;
&#13;
 especially in Africa.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             We also welcome the revised version of the paper&#13;
&#13;
 and support the main thrust of the strategy.        From the&#13;
&#13;
 outset, let me commend the paper for its language in&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 11, Roman iii, that the strategy will be demand-&#13;
&#13;
 driven, the tools will be offered to interested&#13;
&#13;
 policymakers.    As a constituency of borrowing countries,&#13;
&#13;
 we are also reassured by this kind of language, and we are&#13;
&#13;
 always uncomfortable with language mentioning proactivity,&#13;
&#13;
 corporate priorities and the like because they are code&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 words for pushing countries to do what they may not want&#13;
&#13;
 to.   So, I thank very much the team for that.&#13;
&#13;
            In CODE, we had two main concerns.      The first&#13;
&#13;
 one was that the paper seemed to be a bit too generic and&#13;
&#13;
 there was even a discussion whether it was really a&#13;
&#13;
 strategy or maybe a little more than a concept paper, and&#13;
&#13;
 there was a question of how it would materialize in the&#13;
&#13;
 regions.   And we had a very good briefing afterwards, and&#13;
&#13;
 I would thank the team for that.       So, our concern in this&#13;
&#13;
 area has been dissipated.&#13;
&#13;
            The second concern was on how this strategy&#13;
&#13;
 would impact of other areas of activities which themselves&#13;
&#13;
 have a strategy, for instance, the health and especially&#13;
&#13;
 the financial sector, because the language gave the&#13;
&#13;
 impression that through strategy we might be writing a&#13;
&#13;
 strategy for other areas.     And I am happy to see that&#13;
&#13;
 there was some change in the language in Chapter 6.&#13;
&#13;
 Perhaps the change in language was not far enough although&#13;
&#13;
 we were somewhat reassured by the introductory remarks in&#13;
&#13;
 this area, but still I would like to ask whether the&#13;
&#13;
 language here was cleared with the other areas, especially&#13;
&#13;
 the financial sector people.      Because I understand that&#13;
&#13;
 especially the financial sector is highly technical and&#13;

&#13;
 there are some standards already being applied worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
 And I would like to have this assurance.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Chen.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. CHEN:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I welcome today's discussion and I would like to&#13;
&#13;
 commend management and staff for this very comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
 and informative document.     In principle, I agree with the&#13;
&#13;
 holistic and integrated analysis as well as systematic&#13;
&#13;
 linkage between poverty reduction and the social&#13;
&#13;
 protection strategy.    I think social protection is a&#13;
&#13;
 necessary foundation for sustainable development.&#13;
&#13;
           I have the following general comments.       On&#13;
&#13;
 selectivity, while I agree with most ideas in the paper, I&#13;
&#13;
 feel that the definition of the social protection in this&#13;
&#13;
 paper is too broad and ambitious.       I think that&#13;
&#13;
 intellectually we can debate almost everything but it does&#13;
&#13;
 not necessarily mean that we are able to operationalize&#13;
&#13;
 everything we debated.    Intellectual concept is one thing&#13;
&#13;
 while operation is another.&#13;
&#13;
           The Bank may get stuck somewhere if it tries to&#13;
&#13;
 translate every intellectual concept into practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Therefore, I think that the paper should be more selective&#13;
&#13;
 and should be focused on a few areas where the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 involvement can really make a difference.&#13;
&#13;
             On division of labor, the Bank's role and the&#13;
&#13;
 comparative advantage in social protection have to be&#13;
&#13;
 examined on the basis of the work being done by other&#13;
&#13;
 partners.    From this perspective, the work in the area of&#13;
&#13;
 core labor standards is not part of the Bank's main&#13;
&#13;
 business and should be left to ILO.&#13;
&#13;
             On the child labor issue, paragraph 139 mentions&#13;
&#13;
 measures the Bank may take to keep children in school and&#13;
&#13;
 away from labor.    While I think that these measures will&#13;
&#13;
 help, most relevant and effective measures the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
 take is to help member countries to stimulate their&#13;
&#13;
 economic growth, because I think if the household is poor,&#13;
&#13;
 they have to send the children to work to support their&#13;
&#13;
 family.    So, I think the Bank's comparative advantage in&#13;
&#13;
 this area is to help member countries to develop their&#13;
&#13;
 economy.&#13;
&#13;
             And I agree with Ms. Bachmayer in her written&#13;
&#13;
 statement that the role of employment should be better&#13;
&#13;
 reflected in this strategy paper.&#13;

&#13;
           Having said that, I was wondering because the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank has limited resources, I don't know how the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 could translate the proposed strategy into action.       I&#13;
&#13;
 think a financing mechanism should be made as part of the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy implementation.&#13;
&#13;
           On social funds, I share previous speakers'&#13;
&#13;
 view.   I think that we need a balanced view and I am&#13;
&#13;
 looking forward to OED's assessment on social funds.&#13;
&#13;
           I understand this is the first Bank sector&#13;
&#13;
 strategy paper in social protection.        I think that with&#13;
&#13;
 our concerted effort this strategy could also be the best&#13;
&#13;
 one.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much indeed.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Holden.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. HOLDEN:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I must say I wasn't surprised by Mr. Holzmann's&#13;
&#13;
 expressions of relief at finally getting to this point.&#13;
&#13;
 It has been I think I can fairly say a struggle for all of&#13;
&#13;
 us, both in terms of how to think about social protection&#13;
&#13;
 obviously in the context of the Bank's overall activity,&#13;
&#13;
 but also, of course, how to think about this document, as&#13;
&#13;
 others have discussed when we discussed it at some length&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 at CODE, the tensions between its role as a concept piece,&#13;
&#13;
 a sector strategy or even a thematic strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           The third time around I still found the paper&#13;
&#13;
 pretty heavy-going, I must say, and, if anything, a bit&#13;
&#13;
 cluttered.   And there are still parts after a third&#13;
&#13;
 reading I don't fully understand.       And just on this point&#13;
&#13;
 I would endorse Pieter Stek's call for a little bit more&#13;
&#13;
 signalling as to where the paper has been changed.      It&#13;
&#13;
 will be helpful particularly at these busy times.&#13;
&#13;
           I mean, obviously, the authors of the report&#13;
&#13;
 have been forced rather to be all things to all people.&#13;
&#13;
 And even now we are finding quite different perspectives.&#13;
&#13;
           My own suspicion is as soon as we use the word&#13;
&#13;
 "social", we invite demands for inclusion of everything&#13;
&#13;
 that is directly or indirectly associated with what we&#13;
&#13;
 think of as social policy or even Bank activity.&#13;
&#13;
           But while this is obviously a cross-cutting&#13;
&#13;
 issue, as others have said, we already have sector&#13;
&#13;
 strategies in many other sectors.       We have got health,&#13;
&#13;
 education, finance and so on.      And for this reason, my&#13;
&#13;
 preference was and is in favor of the rather narrower&#13;
&#13;
 scope, focusing on the Bank's role in social risk&#13;
&#13;
 management, pensions, labor markets and so on, while, at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the same time, recognizing the importance of vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
 in risk analysis, risk management as an adjunct to&#13;
&#13;
 traditional thinking about all aspects of Bank activities.&#13;
&#13;
 So, if you want to coin it, as I said at CODE, sector&#13;
&#13;
 strategy with thematic over or undertones.&#13;
&#13;
           Notwithstanding the management's attempts to go&#13;
&#13;
 narrower rather than broader, I did have some real fears,&#13;
&#13;
 as Luis has already said, about easy it would be to&#13;
&#13;
 operationalize this strategy.      And this reflects not only&#13;
&#13;
 the very high level of abstraction that we are dealing&#13;
&#13;
 with here compared to other sectors, and not only the&#13;
&#13;
 reality that there is a lot here that is new, a lot that&#13;
&#13;
 is contentious and a lot that is quite unclear, but also -&#13;
&#13;
 - and perhaps most particularly -- recognition of the very&#13;
&#13;
 different contexts, for example, as between transition&#13;
&#13;
 economies with their large formal and some would say&#13;
&#13;
 unaffordable public mechanisms for social protection and&#13;
&#13;
 at the other extreme the context that applies very much in&#13;
&#13;
 Africa of countries where households are required to rely&#13;
&#13;
 almost exclusively on informal strategies to manage risk,&#13;
&#13;
 and where as a practical consideration the scope for&#13;
&#13;
 redistribution, which is never far from our thinking about&#13;
&#13;
 social protection, is severely limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           I must say, as Luis has already said, that my&#13;
&#13;
 concerns to a very large degree removed, although not&#13;
&#13;
 entirely dispelled, but lessened anyway by the very&#13;
&#13;
 informative and helpful presentations that we had from the&#13;
&#13;
 regional teams in July.    It was clear from these&#13;
&#13;
 presentations that the regions are finding the conceptual&#13;
&#13;
 framework useful, even if it is operational.       It adopts a&#13;
&#13;
 very different approach in different environments.&#13;
&#13;
           I suppose in this context I do have some&#13;
&#13;
 difficulty with the Nordic chair's call for, if I&#13;
&#13;
 interpreted it correctly, minimum levels of state&#13;
&#13;
 provision of social protection.       And I think this flows&#13;
&#13;
 into the debate about core labor standards and so on as&#13;
&#13;
 well.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't believe that we can ignore the&#13;
&#13;
 differential social, economic and cultural traditions&#13;
&#13;
 within our membership.    I don't think it is going to be&#13;
&#13;
 successful.   And I very much agree with Mr. Rivera that we&#13;
&#13;
 must avoid -- if I was being provocative, I might call it&#13;
&#13;
 a eurocentric [phonetic] approach -- of overstating       the&#13;
&#13;
 importance of the formal sector.       As I think we discussed&#13;
&#13;
 at length in the CODE meeting, there is an awful lot about&#13;
&#13;
 the informal sector that we don't know and in many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 regions, many countries, it is a much more important&#13;
&#13;
 sector when thinking about the poor than is the formal&#13;
&#13;
 sector.&#13;
&#13;
           So, on that non-provocative note, I will stop.&#13;
&#13;
 Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Harada.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. HARADA:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           We also welcome this opportunity to discuss the&#13;
&#13;
 first sector strategy paper for social protection.     And we&#13;
&#13;
 commend management and staff in preparing this very well&#13;
&#13;
 written paper.&#13;
&#13;
           We concur with the thrust of this paper and we&#13;
&#13;
 support the social risk management approach as the&#13;
&#13;
 conceptual framework for this social protection sector.&#13;
&#13;
 We also welcome the paper's emphasis on the importance of&#13;
&#13;
 partnership, its focus on the importance of&#13;
&#13;
 implementation, quite well thought out strategy how to&#13;
&#13;
 incorporate social protection sector work to country-&#13;
&#13;
 specific, regional work.&#13;
&#13;
           We would like to provide a few comments on&#13;
&#13;
 relatively general areas.     One is relating to the&#13;
&#13;
 implication of social risk management approach to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 width of the definition of social protection sector.       I&#13;
&#13;
 heard the view from Mr. Rivera with interest that he was&#13;
&#13;
 saying that this approach can be too narrow.       I can&#13;
&#13;
 understand his way of thinking.&#13;
&#13;
           But I tend to agree with Mr. Chen and Mr. Holden&#13;
&#13;
 to believe that the risk is rather on the tendency to be&#13;
&#13;
 too broad.   As pointed out by the paper, the financial&#13;
&#13;
 sector, including microfinancing or rural development or&#13;
&#13;
 education, infrastructure, health, all those works can be&#13;
&#13;
 formulated on the basis of social risk management approach&#13;
&#13;
 as having a vital role in reducing various risks.&#13;
&#13;
           I understand that it is not the management's&#13;
&#13;
 view to take all those areas under the umbrella of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection, but we have to be aware of the risk that we&#13;
&#13;
 can be too broad in focus.     So, caution should be on the&#13;
&#13;
 selectivity side or more focused side, rather than try to&#13;
&#13;
 broaden the area, the definition of the social protection&#13;
&#13;
 sector.&#13;
&#13;
           In this regard, I totally agree with the paper&#13;
&#13;
 about the importance of partnership, and the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
 focus on those areas with its comparative advantage and&#13;
&#13;
 paying due regard to other agencies' comparative&#13;
&#13;
 advantage.&#13;

                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
             I would like also to comment particularly on the&#13;
&#13;
 implication of the sector strategy paper's discussion on&#13;
&#13;
 collaboration with the Fund.       It is clear that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 should play a leading role in this area, particularly the&#13;
&#13;
 design and implementation of pension or social safety net,&#13;
&#13;
 labor market policy.    Those areas should be in the core of&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank.    And I think there is at this point quite a&#13;
&#13;
 general consensus on this.&#13;
&#13;
             On the other hand, it is very important to&#13;
&#13;
 recognize that all those areas do have macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
 implications.    The pension system has a very important&#13;
&#13;
 impact on the size of the government's budget.      Many&#13;
&#13;
 policies in this area have tax revenue implications and&#13;
&#13;
 the structure of the labor market has a very important&#13;
&#13;
 impact on the overall efficiency, structural efficiency of&#13;
&#13;
 the economy.&#13;
&#13;
             So, the Bank should be quite aware of those&#13;
&#13;
 implications, interactions of the work in this area to the&#13;
&#13;
 overall macroeconomic stability of the economy.      And it is&#13;
&#13;
 a very important point in the collaboration with the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
             On the other hand, we would like to have the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund be quite aware of social implications of their&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic policy designs, and the Bank with its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 expertise in this area should provide useful inputs to the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund from that point of view.&#13;
&#13;
           The third point I would like to make is the&#13;
&#13;
 importance of the country-specific approach in this&#13;
&#13;
 sector.   And we welcome the emphasis on this point, the&#13;
&#13;
 importance of the full involvement of the Regional Vice&#13;
&#13;
 Presidency from this point of view.&#13;
&#13;
           As we touched upon on this point on the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion of international financial architecture, the&#13;
&#13;
 social protection sector policies involve very unique&#13;
&#13;
 features of each country; traditionally, socially,&#13;
&#13;
 culturally, each country has quite unique systems, and so&#13;
&#13;
 in designing social protection sector policies, one fits&#13;
&#13;
 all approach cannot be definitely applied and country-&#13;
&#13;
 specific approach is very important.        And I understand&#13;
&#13;
 this paper's direction is the same.&#13;
&#13;
           In that regard, we would like to emphasize again&#13;
&#13;
 the importance with the collaboration with the regional&#13;
&#13;
 development banks, which have expertise in the regional&#13;
&#13;
 and country-specific features nationally by their intimate&#13;
&#13;
 relations with the regional economies.&#13;

&#13;
            MS. PIERCY:   Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            I think we have been so focused on this&#13;
&#13;
 discussion on a number of particular points we want to&#13;
&#13;
 make, that I would like to start by just backing up for a&#13;
&#13;
 second and start with very warm congratulations on this&#13;
&#13;
 first framing of the social protection challenges that are&#13;
&#13;
 faced.&#13;
&#13;
            And I very much appreciate having you share,&#13;
&#13;
 Jim, because I think the President participating has a&#13;
&#13;
 strong signalling effect throughout the Bank and to staff.&#13;
&#13;
 And we have had challenges in kind of getting traction for&#13;
&#13;
 the whole social area and social protection area vis-a-vis&#13;
&#13;
 the other very important commitments in our lending that&#13;
&#13;
 are better established in the Bank's tradition and&#13;
&#13;
 culture.   So, I think this is extremely important.&#13;
&#13;
            And I think part of the challenge here is that -&#13;
&#13;
 - and this came up in CODE -- it isn't really literally a&#13;
&#13;
 sector strategy.   What we are talking about here is&#13;
&#13;
 something broader than that.       And so, I guess I would take&#13;
&#13;
 exception to some of the speakers, though respecting their&#13;
&#13;
 viewpoints -- and they have valid points -- but I don't&#13;
&#13;
 think the Bank could really do less than the framework, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 broad as that then becomes, in its first explication of&#13;
&#13;
 how it sees social protection.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think we have to cut some slack here and&#13;
&#13;
 not look at this through the lens of all the other&#13;
&#13;
 strategy papers, because our partners rather expect from&#13;
&#13;
 us first what is the framework within which you will&#13;
&#13;
 define what you will do.    And it becomes per force in some&#13;
&#13;
 ways a framework which others relate to as well, which&#13;
&#13;
 leads to the question that I would love to hear a little&#13;
&#13;
 more about, which is I think you have heard around the&#13;
&#13;
 table an endorsement of this conceptualization of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection.   Our debate lies probably in the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation, and there are, I wouldn't say, so much&#13;
&#13;
 differences as nuances or parameters that people are&#13;
&#13;
 talking about in the implementation.&#13;
&#13;
           But we don't disagree with the concept.     So, I&#13;
&#13;
 think this concept is going to be only as effective as it&#13;
&#13;
 is embraced broadly.   So my question then is:     What plans&#13;
&#13;
 are there sort of internally in terms of work with, as the&#13;
&#13;
 question was raised, Task Managers and others to really&#13;
&#13;
 explain this concept and then externally with our partners&#13;
&#13;
 for workshops or consultations or dissemination so that we&#13;
&#13;
 can all agree on this, and it can be the framework that is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 a taking off point not only for what the Bank does but for&#13;
&#13;
 what bilateral donors and the UN system and others do?&#13;
&#13;
           I think in terms of what we are hearing from&#13;
&#13;
 UNDP and others, it is very synergistic, but I think it&#13;
&#13;
 would be really strategic to have those consultations so&#13;
&#13;
 they embrace it as well and we are talking in the same&#13;
&#13;
 terms.   And then that also makes it easier for us to think&#13;
&#13;
 about the sequencing issues and being sensitive to the&#13;
&#13;
 variations of cultural norms and traditions within&#13;
&#13;
 individual countries that we have to do.           So, I would like&#13;
&#13;
 to hear a little bit more about what the plan is for&#13;
&#13;
 dissemination.&#13;
&#13;
           Then next, and as we didn't address this in the&#13;
&#13;
 written I do think I have to say this, I realize we cannot&#13;
&#13;
 in our discussion at the Board sort of blithely ignore the&#13;
&#13;
 resource questions which the paper very candidly states.&#13;
&#13;
 I am sure the President will have something to say about&#13;
&#13;
 this before the discussion closes.&#13;
&#13;
           I do think we have got to talk about this.          It&#13;
&#13;
 has been pointed out to us many times that the budget we&#13;
&#13;
 adopted this year is a budget that doesn't stretch fully&#13;
&#13;
 to implementing all of the programs that we as a Board&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 have endorsed in principle.     So, I think it is appropriate&#13;
&#13;
 to come back at this.&#13;
&#13;
           We have talked here about that the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation depends on the takeup and the priority&#13;
&#13;
 accorded by the countries and the regions, and it depends&#13;
&#13;
 on the resources available.     So, I think it would be&#13;
&#13;
 worthwhile to hear just a little bit more on that resource&#13;
&#13;
 side and the extent to which it would be the view of those&#13;
&#13;
 of you working on this that the phasing is compromising&#13;
&#13;
 some priorities that, if you had your druthers, we would&#13;
&#13;
 be moving for on a more urgent basis.         I think we really&#13;
&#13;
 need to hear that.&#13;
&#13;
           And then, two small points, on the Global&#13;
&#13;
 Children's Initiative Fund, I really would like to hear&#13;
&#13;
 more about this because I had not heard about this until&#13;
&#13;
 in the context of this paper.      And while I can see a&#13;
&#13;
 reason for it, I do wonder about the need for&#13;
&#13;
 crystallizing this as a Fund.      And I guess I would further&#13;
&#13;
 say that it would be my hunch that if this were done, it&#13;
&#13;
 should be under the aegis of UNICEF in the lead.&#13;
&#13;
           I am concerned and increasingly people have&#13;
&#13;
 raised this question with us, as the Bank becomes more&#13;
&#13;
 active and has a higher profile in the social arena, it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 very important.    But is there a risk that because the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 at this moment in time is perceived in some ways to be&#13;
&#13;
 stronger in its delivery capacity that we are going to&#13;
&#13;
 kind of crowd out UNDP or others who have mandates?&#13;
&#13;
             I think it is not this discussion, but I think&#13;
&#13;
 we as a Board need to take this on, because where capacity&#13;
&#13;
 is weak, do we step in and take over or do we have a role&#13;
&#13;
 to try to support strengthening of the capacity of other&#13;
&#13;
 organizations who have the mandate?         So, that is the&#13;
&#13;
 question I had raised in the context of the Global&#13;
&#13;
 Children's Initiative Fund.&#13;
&#13;
             And then, last final point, on Roman numeral vi,&#13;
&#13;
 rethinking microfinance within social protection programs,&#13;
&#13;
 I would just ask for a wording change there.         As it reads&#13;
&#13;
 now, it is saying while the track record is poor, recent&#13;
&#13;
 trends in microfinance, I think the reference is to a&#13;
&#13;
 track record poor of the effort to incorporate&#13;
&#13;
 microfinance in social funds, but it could be ready as the&#13;
&#13;
 track record on microfinance is poor.          And I think it is&#13;
&#13;
 critical that we not inadvertently give that impression,&#13;
&#13;
 because I think all the evidence is strongly to the&#13;
&#13;
 contrary.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:     Perhaps I might intervene&#13;
&#13;
 immediately on a couple of questions.          And let me say that&#13;
&#13;
 on the Children's Fund, that has not yet been fully&#13;
&#13;
 debated in management, and there will be ample opportunity&#13;
&#13;
 to discuss that.   It is an idea which has come up but I&#13;
&#13;
 think the observations you make are very real, and we&#13;
&#13;
 should be very careful.     That will be fully discussed&#13;
&#13;
 before there is any suggestion that we will proceed.          I&#13;
&#13;
 think comments you made about whether it should be here or&#13;
&#13;
 elsewhere and how it should be done are exactly right.&#13;
&#13;
 And we will certainly take that into account.&#13;
&#13;
           The second point on the question of budget, I&#13;
&#13;
 was going to mention that at the end, but let me mention&#13;
&#13;
 it now, that we would put a tremendous burden on our staff&#13;
&#13;
 if we were to go to them today and say there is another&#13;
&#13;
 new initiative which is the way it would be described,&#13;
&#13;
 whether or not it was a new initiative, which is lumbered&#13;
&#13;
 on the staff with the resonance being there of a Staff&#13;
&#13;
 Association newsletter saying that 300 more people are&#13;
&#13;
 going to be cut for budget purposes.         You can imagine how&#13;
&#13;
 it will be received.&#13;
&#13;
           There is already great tension in the staff and&#13;
&#13;
 if we now start talking about new work that they have to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 do without any relief, I would not be introducing this at&#13;
&#13;
 this moment in this way because if I did, you will have a&#13;
&#13;
 reaction against the latest thing which is coming along&#13;
&#13;
 rather than the support which I believe exists for the&#13;
&#13;
 thoughts that are in this paper.&#13;
&#13;
           So, we will have to get to the practical&#13;
&#13;
 question of timing and of implementation, which involves&#13;
&#13;
 the question of cost and support and the people who are in&#13;
&#13;
 this room who come from the regions full well know that&#13;
&#13;
 the pressure of the budget restraint is limiting what they&#13;
&#13;
 are doing already.   And so, when you add new dreams, we&#13;
&#13;
 are going to have to think about the practical aspects of&#13;
&#13;
 what we do.&#13;
&#13;
           The third point I would like to make is this is&#13;
&#13;
 an historic document because it is the first time that we&#13;
&#13;
 have outlined this social strategy in this way for the&#13;
&#13;
 sector.   And as has already been agreed, we are going to&#13;
&#13;
 take a look at it in twelve months' time after there has&#13;
&#13;
 been chance for getting used to it and interchange with&#13;
&#13;
 others.   We don't expect to immediately start rewriting&#13;
&#13;
 it.   We want to move along with it and learn from it.&#13;
&#13;
           But there are a number of aspects to the paper&#13;
&#13;
 which I myself am very interested in discussing, and I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 have told the team.    The first is that in a sense, if you&#13;
&#13;
 think very simply that what we did earlier was more&#13;
&#13;
 reactive in mode than proactive in terms of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection after something has occurred, not entirely was&#13;
&#13;
 that the function but the issue of social protection came&#13;
&#13;
 heavily in terms of a reaction to either economic or&#13;
&#13;
 developmental events which led agglomerations of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
            We extended that to think in terms of preemptive&#13;
&#13;
 action.    And if you think in terms of preemptive action,&#13;
&#13;
 then you have got to analyze it with the social protection&#13;
&#13;
 studies.   You have got to analyze what are the needs and,&#13;
&#13;
 as my colleagues have pointed out, that has to be done on&#13;
&#13;
 a country-by-country basis and with wide consultation and&#13;
&#13;
 determine what it is that can affect you and then what it&#13;
&#13;
 is that you can do about it.       And then, the sector group&#13;
&#13;
 has a number of traditional areas in which it operates,&#13;
&#13;
 ranging from pensions to market access for jobs, child&#13;
&#13;
 labor.    There are number of issues which have&#13;
&#13;
 traditionally been seen as part of the social sector and&#13;
&#13;
 what this study does is to expand it further.&#13;
&#13;
            But the issue I want to discuss in the course of&#13;
&#13;
 the year -- and I have told my colleagues this -- is that&#13;
&#13;
 in a sense everything we do has a social impact.      I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 yesterday attended a celebration for those who are active&#13;
&#13;
 in infrastructure, a celebration because we have taken in&#13;
&#13;
 water and sewerage and in energy projects which had been&#13;
&#13;
 worst performing and in the space of a year have brought&#13;
&#13;
 them up to be amongst the best performing sectors in the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank.   And that is an achievement that make $4 billion&#13;
&#13;
 worth of projects that were lousy, $4 billion worth of&#13;
&#13;
 projects that are pretty good in a portfolio of $51&#13;
&#13;
 billion which we have in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           And so, that is a pretty good achievement, but&#13;
&#13;
 when you look at it, I was anxious to tell my colleagues&#13;
&#13;
 in infrastructure that the impact of what they are doing&#13;
&#13;
 has very strong social preemptive purposes.        If you put in&#13;
&#13;
 a road and power to an urban poor area, that can be the&#13;
&#13;
 strongest preemptive social intervention that you can make&#13;
&#13;
 because it gets people out the possibility of getting jobs&#13;
&#13;
 and frees up the time of women not to have to go down and&#13;
&#13;
 collect wood or some form of power or, if you add water&#13;
&#13;
 and sewerage, it also protects the time that people have&#13;
&#13;
 and it also affects very much the health sector.&#13;
&#13;
           So, if you take something as cold as&#13;
&#13;
 infrastructure, in fact, its social dimension is enormous.&#13;
&#13;
 And what we need to do is to have a sense of social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility and social accountability in decision-&#13;
&#13;
 making on the hard investments in infrastructure.         And you&#13;
&#13;
 need to conceive of those investments not just in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 return on investment but in terms of social impact,&#13;
&#13;
 because the social impact of those investments is very&#13;
&#13;
 considerable.   And the moment that you start talking about&#13;
&#13;
 preemptive actions that can be taken in the social sector,&#13;
&#13;
 some of them may appear in the guise of a road or water or&#13;
&#13;
 sewerage or power, but they are no less effective than&#13;
&#13;
 training or strengthening the familial structure.&#13;
&#13;
            What is better to protect the familial structure&#13;
&#13;
 than allowing the breadwinners to get job?         What is better&#13;
&#13;
 than keeping kids out of child labor than having adequate&#13;
&#13;
 income in the family so that they can educate the kids?&#13;
&#13;
 And what may be the source of that?        Free transportation&#13;
&#13;
 to jobs.   It can also be microcredit.        It can also be many&#13;
&#13;
 of the other issues that have been raised in this paper.&#13;
&#13;
            But I think where we are headed in this is --&#13;
&#13;
 personally I think, although I am not a sociologist and I&#13;
&#13;
 am not up with the debates that my colleagues told me&#13;
&#13;
 about this morning -- but just logically it seems to me&#13;
&#13;
 that in terms of the extension of the impact of this&#13;
&#13;
 sector group, as was mentioned by some of the speakers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 earlier, its impact has to permeate almost everything we&#13;
&#13;
 do.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think this is a very important opening&#13;
&#13;
 statement.   It puts the debate in a different context than&#13;
&#13;
 it has previously been, very clearly so.            It broadens it,&#13;
&#13;
 but I think this year we need to do a lot of work in terms&#13;
&#13;
 of thinking through is this a sector or is this a culture?&#13;
&#13;
 I mean, it is a sector, but it is also a part of the&#13;
&#13;
 emerging Bank culture.&#13;
&#13;
           The moment you say that the focus of the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
 on poverty alleviation, then you talk about social&#13;
&#13;
 responsibility.    So, I was pleased with the document but&#13;
&#13;
 frustrated by it, because I think what it does is to -- if&#13;
&#13;
 they think they have finished the job, I think they are&#13;
&#13;
 just at the beginning of the job, because I think it is a&#13;
&#13;
 wonderful start.   And I congratulate the teams on putting&#13;
&#13;
 their arms around something like this, but I think the&#13;
&#13;
 debate is going to be very important in the rest of this&#13;
&#13;
 year, not just for the definition of the sector but, in&#13;
&#13;
 fact, as a characterization of where the Bank is going.&#13;
&#13;
           And so, for me it is a much broader debate.           I&#13;
&#13;
 mean, I again congratulate the team on a paper which I&#13;
&#13;
 think is really, really important, and I agree with you,&#13;

&#13;
 Jan, or whoever was that said it that we should go out and&#13;
&#13;
 we should talk to other people and we should clearly try&#13;
&#13;
 and explore this.    But this is not the definitive paper on&#13;
&#13;
 social policy.   It is a remarkable start.&#13;
&#13;
           But now that it has opened it up, I think we&#13;
&#13;
 have opened up something that will be very important for&#13;
&#13;
 management and the Board to consider and really gets to&#13;
&#13;
 the question of what the Bank is doing.              And in that&#13;
&#13;
 sense, it is not surprising that I am here because I don't&#13;
&#13;
 think of this as just some other little sector.             It has&#13;
&#13;
 had to fight for its recognition.&#13;
&#13;
           But I think we are at the point now where if you&#13;
&#13;
 listened to everything that was said at the Millennium&#13;
&#13;
 Summit, for example, or what is likely to be said at the&#13;
&#13;
 next meetings or what is being said in the streets, it is&#13;
&#13;
 this stuff.   That may be a bit philosophical answer, but&#13;
&#13;
 it is certainly the way that I am looking at this.             And I&#13;
&#13;
 think it will not be the last chance for the Board to&#13;
&#13;
 intervene and discuss it.&#13;
&#13;
           And I don't think someone that said this is a&#13;
&#13;
 northern approach -- it is certainly not the way I am&#13;
&#13;
 thinking it, but I think that there is a very real&#13;
&#13;
 recognition that informal sectors and -- I think Mr.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Rivera said it -- the need to think in terms of non-&#13;
&#13;
 traditional ways.    I mean, it was pointed out in here that&#13;
&#13;
 the family is the best insurance policy.             When we   talk&#13;
&#13;
 about pensions and we talk about insurance and&#13;
&#13;
 sustainability, we get to the family structure.            You get&#13;
&#13;
 to the informal structures that were mentioned earlier.&#13;
&#13;
           And we need to know and work with that a lot&#13;
&#13;
 more than we have.     Then, you run into issues of who can&#13;
&#13;
 do it, the role of government, the certainty that we&#13;
&#13;
 cannot replace government nor do we want to, but how we&#13;
&#13;
 can try and direct the authorities and work with&#13;
&#13;
 authorities to strengthen informal structures in&#13;
&#13;
 societies.&#13;
&#13;
           And many governments have not thought about it&#13;
&#13;
 themselves in developing countries, not least in Latin&#13;
&#13;
 America, where a lot of the informal structures and things&#13;
&#13;
 are ignored by people in power, one of my biggest&#13;
&#13;
 problems, in fact, in dealing with authority.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think this is an extraordinarily pivotal&#13;
&#13;
 subject, and I think we are at the beginning of it, and I&#13;
&#13;
 think it could have very broad implications so far as the&#13;
&#13;
 overall culture of the Bank is concerned.&#13;

&#13;
           Anyway, that probably is a lot longer than you&#13;
&#13;
 wanted to here, Jan, but anyway it is what I am thinking&#13;
&#13;
 about.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Alyahya.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ALYAHYA:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           We also, like other colleagues, welcome the&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity to discuss this important sector strategy&#13;
&#13;
 paper or, as Ms. Jan Piercy called it, framework paper.&#13;
&#13;
           Well, in retrospect, it might have been&#13;
&#13;
 preferable to put this discussion off until after the&#13;
&#13;
 annual meetings, given the pressures on our schedule at&#13;
&#13;
 this time of the year.      However, our overall reaction is&#13;
&#13;
 that this latest draft has benefited from the discussion&#13;
&#13;
 held earlier in CODE and its Subcommittee, and has made an&#13;
&#13;
 effort to incorporate some of the comments made.&#13;
&#13;
           Notably amongst these was the need to get a&#13;
&#13;
 better sense of internal and external partnerships.      Our&#13;
&#13;
 reaction is, therefore, to be supportive of what in many&#13;
&#13;
 ways is a pioneering document, but also to offer some&#13;
&#13;
 words of caution.    Our reaction is, therefore, to be&#13;
&#13;
 supportive and maybe I should offer some words of caution&#13;
&#13;
 here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                      Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Our specific comments are made in this context.&#13;
&#13;
 Our first point is to note that the whole field of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection and the conceptual framework within which it&#13;
&#13;
 operates is a recent and fast-evolving one for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 and other parties.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, and having said that and, like other&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues who are supportive of the approach in this&#13;
&#13;
 paper, we welcome the approach to move beyond the&#13;
&#13;
 traditional categories of such areas as pensions, social&#13;
&#13;
 funds, labor markets and social safety nets and take a&#13;
&#13;
 bolder approach.&#13;
&#13;
           The key contribution of the paper before us is&#13;
&#13;
 indeed to set forth an integrated program of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction based on social risk management framework.     We&#13;
&#13;
 have no problem with this vision, but it does raise some&#13;
&#13;
 issues of implementation.&#13;
&#13;
           Turning now to those issues, let me just mention&#13;
&#13;
 a few of them.   One is the need for caution stemming from&#13;
&#13;
 the early experience with the Bank's own portfolio where&#13;
&#13;
 there have been some signs of stress, perhaps reflecting&#13;
&#13;
 the complexity and innovative nature of projects.&#13;
&#13;
           Second is the unresolved question of the&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate overall skills mix required in the new Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Third and in spite of the involvement of various&#13;
&#13;
 units within the Bank, as alluded to in the introductory&#13;
&#13;
 remarks by staff, there is the question of the degree of&#13;
&#13;
 buy-in by other parts of the Bank outside of the immediate&#13;
&#13;
 social protection family of specialists.&#13;
&#13;
           Fourth, there is the issue of how the wider&#13;
&#13;
 world has reacted to this proposal in terms of how it will&#13;
&#13;
 affect their thinking and, more appropriately, their&#13;
&#13;
 practice of development assistance.&#13;
&#13;
           On all these points and after listening&#13;
&#13;
 carefully to the discussion so far today, we too are of&#13;
&#13;
 the view that we need some more details as to&#13;
&#13;
 implementation and how such implementation will fit into&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank's overall strategy.      Linked to this is the issue&#13;
&#13;
 of who is to be held accountable within and outside the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank for the new strategy?&#13;
&#13;
           Without repeating what others have said, I&#13;
&#13;
 retain some unease on these implementation and&#13;
&#13;
 accountability issues, and also on the degree of buy-in by&#13;
&#13;
 the outside world.   I trust that these points and those&#13;
&#13;
 made by others who have spoken can be fully reflected in&#13;
&#13;
 the summing up of today's interesting discussion of what&#13;
&#13;
 is basically a sound and thought-provoking paper.&#13;

&#13;
            Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. WOLFENSOHN:   Thank you very much, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Alyahya.&#13;
&#13;
            Mr. Merotto.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. MEROTTO:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            Unfortunately for me but fortunately for&#13;
&#13;
 everybody else, I just received the written statements on&#13;
&#13;
 arrival.   So, having come with a formal statement, I found&#13;
&#13;
 out everyone has said nearly everything I was going to&#13;
&#13;
 say.&#13;
&#13;
            So very briefly and for the record, we welcome&#13;
&#13;
 this useful paper and the discussions which led up to it.&#13;
&#13;
 Like Pieter, Jan and others, we welcome the extension&#13;
&#13;
 beyond social protection, and we especially welcome the&#13;
&#13;
 links to the WDR agenda on which, like Pieter, we look&#13;
&#13;
 forward to discussions on operationalization of the other&#13;
&#13;
 elements of the WDR in the fall.&#13;
&#13;
            Also, like others, we welcome inclusion of the&#13;
&#13;
 social policy principles and gender in the redraft, which&#13;
&#13;
 reflects the useful discussions we had in June and July.&#13;
&#13;
            On social principles, Mr. Chairman, as Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Harada and you have taken my only other original thought,&#13;
&#13;
 which was that there is an important role for the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 cooperation with the Fund on designing socially&#13;
&#13;
 responsible policies, I will just flag for the record that&#13;
&#13;
 we agree with you there that there is an agenda here which&#13;
&#13;
 is emerging and becoming more important with&#13;
&#13;
 globalization, which is just what is the framework for&#13;
&#13;
 socially responsible policy.&#13;
&#13;
           We agree with Jan, Pieter, Anna and others on&#13;
&#13;
 the need to incorporate evaluation lessons of social&#13;
&#13;
 funds.   I think here if we are not careful, there is a&#13;
&#13;
 risk that operationalization of the strategy in practice&#13;
&#13;
 will boil down to social funds.       So, to the list of&#13;
&#13;
 considerations on social fund evaluation, which others&#13;
&#13;
 have mentioned, I would add the need to consider&#13;
&#13;
 sustainability issues, not just in relation to projects,&#13;
&#13;
 as Mr. Rivera has said, but sustainability of&#13;
&#13;
 participation and community driven development based&#13;
&#13;
 around access to external funds.&#13;
&#13;
           There are issues there, I guess, which staff are&#13;
&#13;
 on top of.   And in the eurocentric mode, I would just flag&#13;
&#13;
 the need to incorporate public sector management issues in&#13;
&#13;
 this evaluation as well.&#13;
&#13;
           Lastly, I agree with Jan on the need to broaden&#13;
&#13;
 our discussion on core labor standards and also look&#13;

&#13;
 forward to the Bank's discussions with the ILO and IFCTU&#13;
&#13;
 in October.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. WOLFENSOHN:   Thank you very much, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Merotto.&#13;
&#13;
            Mr. Oyewole.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. OYEWOLE:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            We welcome this first sector strategy paper for&#13;
&#13;
 the social protection sector.      With the evolution of the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank's involvement in social protection in the last two&#13;
&#13;
 decades, this is an appropriate time to take stock and&#13;
&#13;
 articulate a coherent World Bank strategy for the sector&#13;
&#13;
 based on lessons of experience.&#13;
&#13;
            As recognized in the report, discrete individual&#13;
&#13;
 social protection programs in response to specific events&#13;
&#13;
 must give way to a more holistic approach to social&#13;
&#13;
 protection with a view to having a more lasting impact on&#13;
&#13;
 a greater number of people.&#13;
&#13;
            At this stage in the discussion, I would merely&#13;
&#13;
 like to focus my remarks on a few points.          As you yourself&#13;
&#13;
 have pointed out a few minutes ago, Mr. Chairman, it is&#13;
&#13;
 important to recognize that ultimately the most effective&#13;
&#13;
 means of providing lasting social protection for a people&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 is by increasing their access to the fundamentals of&#13;
&#13;
 development -- education, health, infrastructure, capacity&#13;
&#13;
 building, institutional development and so on.        As such,&#13;
&#13;
 there is no substitute for broad-based poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 programs within which social protection interventions&#13;
&#13;
 should be subsumed.&#13;
&#13;
           The effectiveness of poverty reduction programs&#13;
&#13;
 will in turn be determined by the effectiveness of&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic policies.     The Bank's overall mission of&#13;
&#13;
 helping countries to achieve poverty reducing growth,&#13;
&#13;
 therefore, remains valid but will need to be interpreted&#13;
&#13;
 in a more socially responsible way.&#13;
&#13;
           For social protection programs to work&#13;
&#13;
 effectively over the long run, they should aim as much as&#13;
&#13;
 possible to become self-sustaining.         While recognizing the&#13;
&#13;
 crucial lead role governments must play in developing and&#13;
&#13;
 supporting social protection programs, especially in the&#13;
&#13;
 poorest countries, this support must be complemented by&#13;
&#13;
 affordable community-based and market-based mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
 both formal and informal, as these are often more&#13;
&#13;
 accessible to a larger number of people and sometimes even&#13;
&#13;
 more dependable.&#13;

&#13;
           The country context will determine the most&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate mix of instruments to address the specific&#13;
&#13;
 range of vulnerabilities to which the people are exposed.&#13;
&#13;
 The issue of institutional capacity building will be key&#13;
&#13;
 to enhancing the effectiveness of both public and private&#13;
&#13;
 sector interventions in this area.&#13;
&#13;
           In most country environments, it is difficult to&#13;
&#13;
 separate social risks from economic risks.         For example,&#13;
&#13;
 poor farmers are vulnerable to commodity price risks as&#13;
&#13;
 the ability to protect themselves from social risk is&#13;
&#13;
 compromised, where agriculture prices or weather&#13;
&#13;
 conditions are unfavorable.     As such, as any Bank social&#13;
&#13;
 protection strategy must operate in parallel to Bank&#13;
&#13;
 Group's and other institutions' interventions in the area&#13;
&#13;
 of commodity risk management and other insurance&#13;
&#13;
 mechanisms that are more targeted to mitigating economic&#13;
&#13;
 risks for the poor.   This will call for closer&#13;
&#13;
 collaboration among the relevant departments within the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank and a greater exchange of information among them and&#13;
&#13;
 with other institutions.&#13;
&#13;
           On the whole, we very much welcome the&#13;
&#13;
 articulation of the Bank strategy in the area of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection.   We see it as headed in the right direction.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 In particular, the recognition that the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
 maximize partnership opportunities is pragmatic and&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate, given the vast amount of work already carried&#13;
&#13;
 out by other institutions in this area.&#13;
&#13;
             Actual implementation of the Bank's social&#13;
&#13;
 protection strategy will reflect regional priorities.               As&#13;
&#13;
 the paper recognizes, Sub-Saharan Africa presents a unique&#13;
&#13;
 set of problems and we can endorse the general approach&#13;
&#13;
 outlined in the strategy for the region.             Undoubtedly,&#13;
&#13;
 informal mechanisms must constitute an important component&#13;
&#13;
 of this approach.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, it is important to ensure that social&#13;
&#13;
 protection interventions by the Bank are adequately funded&#13;
&#13;
 if they are to be credible.       As you pointed out, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Chairman, it would be damaging to staff morale if this&#13;
&#13;
 initiative were to be perceived as yet another unfunded&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
             We would like to conclude by complimenting the&#13;
&#13;
 authors of this sector strategy paper for an excellent&#13;
&#13;
 document.    We trust that the strategy will over time&#13;
&#13;
 benefit from further lessons of experience in this dynamic&#13;
&#13;
 area.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;

           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Thank you very much for that&#13;
&#13;
 thoughtful comment.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Bugrov.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. BUGROV:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't want to repeat many good things that&#13;
&#13;
 have been said, and the intention is to really welcome&#13;
&#13;
 this paper, which is something we have been waiting for.&#13;
&#13;
 I would agree with Jan that this is more of a framework&#13;
&#13;
 paper than a strategy paper.&#13;
&#13;
           Of course, there would be some issues that I&#13;
&#13;
 would like to see sort of more pronounced in the paper&#13;
&#13;
 like more proactive employment policy.         I would also&#13;
&#13;
 single out the issue of better collaboration with the Fund&#13;
&#13;
 on the social issues, and there is a very good point&#13;
&#13;
 somewhere in the paper that addresses the issues of how&#13;
&#13;
 much is enough, particularly when we would be dealing with&#13;
&#13;
 -- hopefully not -- but most probably would be dealing&#13;
&#13;
 with some future crisis situations.&#13;
&#13;
           I also hope that this paper would put all the&#13;
&#13;
 projects in this area of social issues on some sort of a&#13;
&#13;
 preferential track because it is at the core of what we&#13;
&#13;
 are supposed to do.     So, I believe a priority should be&#13;
&#13;
 given to that.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            It also brings me, Mr. Chairman, to your speech&#13;
&#13;
 in Hong Kong at the annual meeting when you were talking&#13;
&#13;
 about the issues of social inclusion.          This is precisely&#13;
&#13;
 the answer in most of the aspects to the agenda that has&#13;
&#13;
 been set at that time.     And to me it is a very good&#13;
&#13;
 beginning.&#13;
&#13;
            I could also repeat this banality that we many&#13;
&#13;
 times say that implementation is key but, in fact, it is a&#13;
&#13;
 key challenge of course.     It would be extremely difficult&#13;
&#13;
 to do that and I believe we will be criticized from&#13;
&#13;
 various sources.&#13;
&#13;
            I was looking at Annex F, for example, that&#13;
&#13;
 talks about shifts in work program priorities by social&#13;
&#13;
 protection.   People would probably not look at those areas&#13;
&#13;
 where they were planning to do more, but they would be&#13;
&#13;
 looking at those issues that we would like you to drop or&#13;
&#13;
 do less.   And when they would find that they will be much&#13;
&#13;
 likely to support for active market programs, there will&#13;
&#13;
 be much less support for unemployment insurance programs&#13;
&#13;
 from OECD countries and many other things.          Well, they may&#13;
&#13;
 ask who is going to do that actually if the Bank is not&#13;
&#13;
 going to concentrate on that.       And there are many other&#13;
&#13;
 examples here, particularly on safety nets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Again, it brings me to this issue of how much is&#13;
&#13;
 enough.   When we learn that the Bank will be sort of&#13;
&#13;
 cutting a bit its work on improving means testing, one&#13;
&#13;
 again may be asking questions why it is so.         Are we going&#13;
&#13;
 to out-source it then?     Are we trying to out-source&#13;
&#13;
 solutions in this area?     So, I would rather have another&#13;
&#13;
 column in the table that would say that certain things we&#13;
&#13;
 do less are very well dealt with by ILO and many other&#13;
&#13;
 organizations that are involved, be they national or&#13;
&#13;
 international.&#13;
&#13;
           But I don't want to go into the specifics.        I&#13;
&#13;
 simply wanted to say that this is a paper that has our&#13;
&#13;
 full support.    And we would be, together with the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
 willing to participate in its implementation, although it&#13;
&#13;
 is quite a challenge.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Passacantando.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PASSACANTANDO:      Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           I want to come back on a specific issue that we&#13;
&#13;
 raised in the written statement.        It is the issue of the&#13;
&#13;
 coordination between the World Bank and IMF on social&#13;
&#13;
 sector and social protection programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           This issue arises because in the Bank there are&#13;
&#13;
 different networks that deal with the issue, while in the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund, because of its narrower mandate, there is a Fiscal&#13;
&#13;
 Department that mainly deals with issues.&#13;
&#13;
           The result is, however, that we often heard&#13;
&#13;
 about difficulties of coordination between the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 the Fund with specific social programs because of the lack&#13;
&#13;
 of one focal point within the Bank on this issue.    I think&#13;
&#13;
 this is an issue that needs to be addressed, and I&#13;
&#13;
 wondered what are your thoughts on this.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WOLFENSOHN:    Let me just comment on this&#13;
&#13;
 specific question and say that a good part of the&#13;
&#13;
 discussions I had with Horst Koehler in Jackson and that&#13;
&#13;
 have been repeated in our subsequent discussions as&#13;
&#13;
 recently as yesterday at lunch demonstrate his own&#13;
&#13;
 personal concern on exactly this question, which is the&#13;
&#13;
 impact of Fund programs on poverty and on social&#13;
&#13;
 structures.&#13;
&#13;
           This was started by Michel in the last year&#13;
&#13;
 where he, as you will remember at last year's annual&#13;
&#13;
 meeting to the surprise of many, including to many in the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund, enunciated a social policy in the broader sense that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 had not been articulated with that degree of vigor I think&#13;
&#13;
 before.   In fact, I told him I thought he was running for&#13;
&#13;
 the Presidency of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           The point was that that was a very important&#13;
&#13;
 moment in the Fund in terms of a lead from the top.   My&#13;
&#13;
 guess is that the way to handle this is to work&#13;
&#13;
 increasingly closely first with Horst Koehler and with&#13;
&#13;
 Horst and his new management team as he is articulating&#13;
&#13;
 what he wants to do, which he is in the process of trying&#13;
&#13;
 to establish, and that this is not a long-term thing; this&#13;
&#13;
 is very near-term.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think the lead will come from him and his&#13;
&#13;
 management team.   And that is the first and necessary&#13;
&#13;
 precondition to getting a better understanding at the&#13;
&#13;
 working level between the Fund teams and the Bank teams.&#13;
&#13;
           He was talking yesterday about the importance of&#13;
&#13;
 understanding the political climate in a country, in its&#13;
&#13;
 most constructive sense, not to intervene in party&#13;
&#13;
 politics but to look at what is the frame of reference in&#13;
&#13;
 a country that we are working in, what is feasible, what,&#13;
&#13;
 in fact, is both politically and socially possible.&#13;
&#13;
           And I think he is making very fast progress in&#13;
&#13;
 his own thinking in terms of saying that each of us needs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 to be much more conscious of the social issues in the best&#13;
&#13;
 sense, not in an interventionist sense but in a best sense&#13;
&#13;
 in countries, and that we need to just take a little time&#13;
&#13;
 to let him evolve in his own thinking.&#13;
&#13;
           But I think that with the paper that we have&#13;
&#13;
 which no doubt we will be discussing with the Fund -- we&#13;
&#13;
 have already had discussions with the Fund on the subject&#13;
&#13;
 but we will have more -- that the next six months will be&#13;
&#13;
 a very important time, but that we should not be pushing&#13;
&#13;
 the Fund at this moment.    I think they are at a very&#13;
&#13;
 important stage themselves in their thinking.&#13;
&#13;
           It is seems to me that they are advancing very&#13;
&#13;
 much in terms of the way in which they are approaching&#13;
&#13;
 these issues about the priorities that they would give to&#13;
&#13;
 social expenditures; for example, when you are making&#13;
&#13;
 fiscal cuts, which historically they have been&#13;
&#13;
 characterized or caricatured that the fiscal cuts&#13;
&#13;
 immediately hit the poor is something I know Horst Koehler&#13;
&#13;
 doesn't want to have as a caricature.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think in an answer to your question we&#13;
&#13;
 will continue the interaction at the working level, but I&#13;
&#13;
 think the single most important thing that is going on now&#13;
&#13;
 at the Fund is a reconsideration of their own frame of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 reference.   And I don't think it is for us to influence&#13;
&#13;
 that.   I think we will see in the coming months an&#13;
&#13;
 evaluation of that.   And from what I gather from Horst&#13;
&#13;
 Koehler's current perceptions, they are very much in line&#13;
&#13;
 with our own.&#13;
&#13;
            So, I wouldn't push today for is it Mr. X or Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Y and is there a new joint social policy working group&#13;
&#13;
 like the financial group.     I think it would be premature.&#13;
&#13;
 I think we should let this next few months involved, be&#13;
&#13;
 monitoring it, see where it goes and it may be that it&#13;
&#13;
 emerges from the Fund side an outreach.&#13;
&#13;
            And frankly, if that were to happen, it would be&#13;
&#13;
 much stronger from our point of view in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 enduring quality of such an effort.        But I want to&#13;
&#13;
 reassure you that my discussions to date have been&#13;
&#13;
 extraordinarily constructive on this subject with Horst&#13;
&#13;
 Koehler.   And I think he understands it.&#13;
&#13;
            For example, on Africa, yet again yesterday we&#13;
&#13;
 reverted to the prospect of a possible joint initiative&#13;
&#13;
 between the two of us where the Bank and the Fund come&#13;
&#13;
 together in terms of linking what they are doing and what&#13;
&#13;
 we are doing on Africa in everything from AIDS to&#13;
&#13;
 employment, to governance, to fiscal structure and so on.&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 These are all sounds that are now emerging on the other&#13;
&#13;
 side of the street.    And I think what we should just do is&#13;
&#13;
 let them emerge and then be responsive.             There is no need&#13;
&#13;
 for us to invent them, because I think Horst and his team&#13;
&#13;
 now seem to be discussing them along these lines.&#13;
&#13;
             If in a few months it changes, I will come back&#13;
&#13;
 and tell you, but at the moment it seems to me that it is&#13;
&#13;
 very much on track and that his speech at the annual&#13;
&#13;
 meeting is likely to include some references to this type&#13;
&#13;
 of issue.    At least that I believe is his current&#13;
&#13;
 thinking.&#13;
&#13;
             I need to tell the Board that I have a meeting&#13;
&#13;
 with President Moi in ten minutes which is real time stuff&#13;
&#13;
 and I cannot keep him waiting.       And I have now just been&#13;
&#13;
 told that he coming five minutes earlier.            So, if you&#13;
&#13;
 don't mind, we have to hear from Mr. Pandian and then&#13;
&#13;
 Steen is going to respond and there is already drafted the&#13;
&#13;
 concluding statement which I have just glanced at and&#13;
&#13;
 which can be read by Shengman if he is here; there he is.&#13;
&#13;
             Well, he will have the benefit of giving you his&#13;
&#13;
 last minute observations on the discussion, which no doubt&#13;
&#13;
 will be very deep.    But if you will forgive me, I really&#13;
&#13;
 have to go and deal with President Moi.&#13;

&#13;
           I will be going to New York at three o'clock to&#13;
&#13;
 attend the reception which President Clinton is giving for&#13;
&#13;
 the heads of government in an attempt to see a few people,&#13;
&#13;
 and I will report to you on that on Friday.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you for a great discussion.         Mr. Pandian.&#13;
&#13;
           [Whereupon, Mr. Zhang assumed the chair.]&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PANDIAN:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           Like others, we also welcome this document and&#13;
&#13;
 this discussion.   We think it is an excellent paper.        We&#13;
&#13;
 are very much pleased to note that this will be a country-&#13;
&#13;
 driven strategy and demand-driven.&#13;
&#13;
           At this last moment, I would like to limit my&#13;
&#13;
 comments on only two points.       How we are going to make&#13;
&#13;
 this social protection policy really inclusive, whether&#13;
&#13;
 this social protection strategy is for the poor or for the&#13;
&#13;
 poorest of the poor.     Because we have practical&#13;
&#13;
 difficulties for implementing this strategy, particularly&#13;
&#13;
 in a country like India.     How we are going to target our&#13;
&#13;
 policies to the right people?       Because at the ground&#13;
&#13;
 level, lack of information is a major deterrent in framing&#13;
&#13;
 schemes and policies.&#13;
&#13;
           Similarly, because the capacity of the&#13;
&#13;
 government, not only at the federal but at the state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 level, at the subnational and the district level, is very&#13;
&#13;
 important because if the delivery system is not&#13;
&#13;
 strengthened, then socially, politically and&#13;
&#13;
 administratively it will be difficult to implement any&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             The second point is I would like to know what&#13;
&#13;
 will be the effect of the digital divide on social&#13;
&#13;
 protection?    What will be the fallout?        Because the&#13;
&#13;
 information technology, on the one hand, can be very well&#13;
&#13;
 utilized to gather correct information and to target the&#13;
&#13;
 right people.    At the same time, this is going to make a&#13;
&#13;
 great impact because there will be a shake-out in many of&#13;
&#13;
 the industries and companies, and how we are going to&#13;
&#13;
 protect these people.     Do we have any policy on this,&#13;
&#13;
 because this will have a greater impact where this will&#13;
&#13;
 affect sometimes the middle-income as well as the upper&#13;
&#13;
 poor also?    So, I would like to have comments on these&#13;
&#13;
 subjects.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. ZHANG:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Before I do the easy job of passing it on to the&#13;
&#13;
 team, let's see if anybody else wants to come at this&#13;
&#13;
 point.&#13;

&#13;
           Yes, Terrie.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. O'LEARY:    The only point I wanted to add,&#13;
&#13;
 because a lot of good points have been made, is that&#13;
&#13;
 picking up on what Jim said before is my only discomfort&#13;
&#13;
 actually is with it being called a social protection&#13;
&#13;
 sector strategy.   I think it is adhering to a paradigm&#13;
&#13;
 that I don't believe exists anymore.         I mean, we have&#13;
&#13;
 Ministers of Finance in developing countries giving&#13;
&#13;
 budgets that include national reduction poverty plans.             We&#13;
&#13;
 have Ministers of Finance in industrialized countries that&#13;
&#13;
 no longer give a budget that just is about taxes and&#13;
&#13;
 deficits and surplus.     I mean, it is very much hand-in-&#13;
&#13;
 hand.&#13;
&#13;
           I worry that some of the really good work and&#13;
&#13;
 ideas that are in this paper get relegated to a different&#13;
&#13;
 stream of thought with a title of social protection.           I&#13;
&#13;
 don't know how to deal with that because our structures&#13;
&#13;
 are so set up, but that is my own sense of discomfort.&#13;
&#13;
           I think there is so much good work done here but&#13;
&#13;
 I hate seeing it dealt with in a social protection&#13;
&#13;
 strategy work because I think it is about so much more&#13;
&#13;
 than that.   And I think that part of the problem that we&#13;
&#13;
 run into -- and we are running into with some countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 that we are dealing with -- is that we are dealing with&#13;
&#13;
 social issues as an add-on to how we deal with some of the&#13;
&#13;
 problems that economic issues have left us.         And I think&#13;
&#13;
 that that gets us into a really bad dynamic because it is&#13;
&#13;
 not just about social policy being a Band-Aid for economic&#13;
&#13;
 policy has done, but it is much more an integral part of&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
             So, I just wanted to put that on the table.       I&#13;
&#13;
 am not sure what we can do about that.          But I don't want&#13;
&#13;
 to see it relegated into a section of the Bank that&#13;
&#13;
 actually isn't dealing with some of the wider economic&#13;
&#13;
 issues.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. ZHANG:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             Anybody else?&#13;
&#13;
             [No response.]&#13;
&#13;
             MR. ZHANG:   If not, maybe, Steen, do you want to&#13;
&#13;
 start it?&#13;
&#13;
             MR. JORGENSEN:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
             First, once again thank you very much for your&#13;
&#13;
 comments, the positive as well as the critical.         We&#13;
&#13;
 continue to learn and I think this is good evidence that&#13;
&#13;
 we cannot sort of breathe a sigh of relief that Robert was&#13;
&#13;
 doing at the beginning and saying this is over, and, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 fact, we are just at the beginning.         And I think we still&#13;
&#13;
 have lots of work to do in this area, and especially the&#13;
&#13;
 challenge that so many of you have mentioned of how to&#13;
&#13;
 turn this into real activities on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
           We are fortunate that we have done this in&#13;
&#13;
 collaboration.    This hasn't been an anchor or center-&#13;
&#13;
 driven process.    It has been done by the regions.         And I&#13;
&#13;
 sort of wish we had time for all my regional colleagues to&#13;
&#13;
 come in and tell you how exactly they are going to deal&#13;
&#13;
 with some of these important issues you brought up.           But&#13;
&#13;
 hopefully, we will have a chance to do that when we come&#13;
&#13;
 back to you and tell you how things have gone in a year's&#13;
&#13;
 time.   I think you will see the regional people at the&#13;
&#13;
 table explaining how this has been done.            I think that&#13;
&#13;
 might be better.&#13;
&#13;
           I guess I should start with social funds.&#13;
&#13;
 Apparently, this is a topic that creates lots of emotions&#13;
&#13;
 on both sides and great debates.        I just want to stress,&#13;
&#13;
 as we do in the paper in Box 2.5, that there are six&#13;
&#13;
 countries in the world -- in Latin America, Africa and in&#13;
&#13;
 the former Soviet Union -- that have decided to do very&#13;
&#13;
 thorough impact evaluations of social funds.           This is work&#13;
&#13;
 that we have been supporting from the social protection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 angle.   The Government of Norway has supported it; it is&#13;
&#13;
 supported by the PREM Group in terms of the poverty group&#13;
&#13;
 in PREM.   So, there is a set of evaluation results that&#13;
&#13;
 are there and are available.&#13;
&#13;
            The other thing is that OED may not have&#13;
&#13;
 completed their complete review of social funds, but they&#13;
&#13;
 have evaluated quite a number of the social funds.         In&#13;
&#13;
 fact, if you look at the data that is in the report on OED&#13;
&#13;
 assessments, the vast majority of those projects are&#13;
&#13;
 social funds.   So, generally, social funds do better on&#13;
&#13;
 scores by OED than other projects.          And I think that is&#13;
&#13;
 important to say.    So, it is not just that we are sort of&#13;
&#13;
 naively going ahead and saying this is a great thing.&#13;
&#13;
            We also very much recognize the things and I&#13;
&#13;
 want to welcome the note from the U.K. chair on this,&#13;
&#13;
 because we know that we can get sustainable buildings.            I&#13;
&#13;
 am sure there is a classroom somewhere where there are no&#13;
&#13;
 teachers, but the overwhelming evidence is that the&#13;
&#13;
 classrooms have teachers; they have more teachers, they&#13;
&#13;
 have better teachers.      And this is the data, including two&#13;
&#13;
 of your constituency countries.         And I think the debate in&#13;
&#13;
 those countries is ongoing on the future of this, because&#13;
&#13;
 that is the important point.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            Where do we take this now?       How do we make sure&#13;
&#13;
 that it doesn't become an excuse for not reforming the&#13;
&#13;
 education sector, that it doesn't become an excuse for not&#13;
&#13;
 doing other things?   How do you make sure that these&#13;
&#13;
 processes at the community level are sustainable like our&#13;
&#13;
 U.K. colleague brought up, not just that the building is&#13;
&#13;
 sustainable but those processes?&#13;
&#13;
            We just had a big discussion here with people&#13;
&#13;
 from 61 countries discussing the future of these things.&#13;
&#13;
 And I think these were exactly the issues that were&#13;
&#13;
 brought up, that there are huge challenges in moving&#13;
&#13;
 forward.&#13;
&#13;
            As regards the specific mention of the MIT&#13;
&#13;
 evaluation, we have assurances from our UNDP colleagues&#13;
&#13;
 that that is not official UNDP policy.         That is the view&#13;
&#13;
 of one professor at one academic university, because we&#13;
&#13;
 were very concerned about that so-called evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
            But I want to say that we very much follow our&#13;
&#13;
 Inter-American Development Bank colleagues here.        This is&#13;
&#13;
 an instrument that is there.      We need to find a way of&#13;
&#13;
 making sure that this one instrument, one out of many, we&#13;
&#13;
 can use it for better and improve it over time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            We can wish it away, but it is not going to go&#13;
&#13;
 away.   It is there and we need to find out how we can use&#13;
&#13;
 it to do it better, and that is what we tried to do here.&#13;
&#13;
 But we will clearly scale back our language.        It is clear&#13;
&#13;
 that we have touched a raw nerve here and there is not the&#13;
&#13;
 general support for that.&#13;
&#13;
            There are number of specific other issues that&#13;
&#13;
 were brought up.   I think that there are two issues where&#13;
&#13;
 we hear comments on both sides.        One is labor standards.&#13;
&#13;
 And I know it was discussed at CODE that there would be a&#13;
&#13;
 broader Board discussion on this, and I think that is&#13;
&#13;
 important what exactly is the role of the Bank going to be&#13;
&#13;
 on this.   Since we have heard comments on both sides, we&#13;
&#13;
 assume that we have hit a happy middle ground where&#13;
&#13;
 everybody is equally uncomfortable, but I do think this is&#13;
&#13;
 something that should be discussed by the Board.&#13;
&#13;
            The other one is really around this issue of is&#13;
&#13;
 there a minimum provision?      I think again we have heard&#13;
&#13;
 issues on both sides, and I would encourage you to discuss&#13;
&#13;
 that more broadly at some point.&#13;
&#13;
            As regards the document and how we are going to&#13;
&#13;
 use this and the bulkiness of it, first of all, a lot of&#13;
&#13;
 Task Managers have been involved in preparing this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 document.    So, it is not going to come as a shock to them&#13;
&#13;
 as something that comes from the center.            A lot of people&#13;
&#13;
 who are actually out there doing the projects are the&#13;
&#13;
 people who have provided the input to this.            We have&#13;
&#13;
 country strategies now being developed in a number of&#13;
&#13;
 countries -- in Latin America and Africa beginning but&#13;
&#13;
 also now in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.            So, we are&#13;
&#13;
 trying to apply in the local circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
             Having recently been a Task Manager, I know how&#13;
&#13;
 it is when all of a sudden a big report lands and it can&#13;
&#13;
 be interpreted as a new initiative.         That is why we very&#13;
&#13;
 carefully say that under the current budget constraints,&#13;
&#13;
 we will start with managing the things we do now, do those&#13;
&#13;
 better, then we will move on to expand as opportunities&#13;
&#13;
 arise.&#13;
&#13;
             I also think it is very important to stress&#13;
&#13;
 again the demand-driven nature of this.             We do not pretend&#13;
&#13;
 to know better than governments what is needed in their&#13;
&#13;
 countries.    What we provide is an opportunity to discuss&#13;
&#13;
 this together.    And we look very much forward to the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 process on this.    We think that is a critical process&#13;
&#13;
 where we hopefully can get these things on the agenda and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 this is also an important area where we can collaborate&#13;
&#13;
 with the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
           On some more specific comments, yes, there is a&#13;
&#13;
 great need to integrate reduction, mitigation and coping.&#13;
&#13;
 We see this as a useful analytical distinction, but&#13;
&#13;
 obviously in practice many programs have effects on more&#13;
&#13;
 than one of these things.      We just think it is important&#13;
&#13;
 that we make a point that we want to move away from purely&#13;
&#13;
 thinking about coping and try to be proactive in a sense.&#13;
&#13;
            We absolutely agree with Mr. Biskup on more&#13;
&#13;
 presentation on how we can measure these things.            It is a&#13;
&#13;
 key part of our work program right now.             We don't have the&#13;
&#13;
 good measures of risk.     We don't have good measures of&#13;
&#13;
 risk management.   We are working with our colleagues in&#13;
&#13;
 the Disaster Management Group, Rural Development Group,&#13;
&#13;
 with UNICEF now on trying to come up what are the&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate indicators for this.        And we hope the follow-&#13;
&#13;
 up work on the World Development Report on the security&#13;
&#13;
 issue will also help us get better measurements on this.&#13;
&#13;
           On the informal sector and especially on the&#13;
&#13;
 cooperative solidarity groups, informal sector is&#13;
&#13;
 absolutely critical, but it is also only fair to say that&#13;
&#13;
 we are just beginning to learn how to deal with that.            How&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 do we as a formal institution deal with agents in the&#13;
&#13;
 informal sector has been quite complex.             So, that is why I&#13;
&#13;
 think you will not see the specific recommendations as&#13;
&#13;
 clearly there yet, but it is something we clearly want to&#13;
&#13;
 work on.   And again, as late as yesterday, we had a joint&#13;
&#13;
 seminar on insurance for the informal sector with our&#13;
&#13;
 financial sector colleagues, and we are doing some work&#13;
&#13;
 with a group of WEAGO [phonetic], with women in the&#13;
&#13;
 informal economy on exactly this issue, what is social&#13;
&#13;
 protection in the informal economy.&#13;
&#13;
            And we have had secondment from the ILO to work&#13;
&#13;
 with us on this.   It is an area we are heavily working on&#13;
&#13;
 but we don't even have the rubber bullets much less the&#13;
&#13;
 silver bullets in this area yet.&#13;
&#13;
            We are sorry that we missed the important&#13;
&#13;
 contribution KfW has done on social funds and that will be&#13;
&#13;
 corrected.&#13;
&#13;
            As with regard to the discussion on too broad in&#13;
&#13;
 scope and too narrow in scope, we tried to do this&#13;
&#13;
 balance.   It doesn't sound like we have got it quite&#13;
&#13;
 right.   I would hope you would allow us to let's see what&#13;
&#13;
 implementation takes.     If the implementation goes well, I&#13;
&#13;
 guess we were about right.      If it wasn't, maybe we were&#13;
&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 either too broad or too narrow in scope.            What we are&#13;
&#13;
 finding is that it is possible to take these generic&#13;
&#13;
 issues that are in this paper and apply them in country&#13;
&#13;
 settings.    What we are also finding out is the specific&#13;
&#13;
 actions are completely different.        The specific actions&#13;
&#13;
 coming out of the Togo report are completely different&#13;
&#13;
 from the ones coming out from the Argentina note.&#13;
&#13;
             And that is the difficulty of being specific in&#13;
&#13;
 implementation in a global paper, but a lot of this is in&#13;
&#13;
 the regional papers.&#13;
&#13;
             There were questions regarding where the entire&#13;
&#13;
 has been involved in this and whether it has been bought&#13;
&#13;
 in by the entire Bank.     We have had very, very close&#13;
&#13;
 operational collaboration with the PREM Group on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 and on gender to the extent that there have been inputs&#13;
&#13;
 provided.    They have seen it; we have discussed it in our&#13;
&#13;
 respective sector boards.&#13;
&#13;
             Similarly, with social development in ESSD and&#13;
&#13;
 with rural development in ESSD, we have been closely&#13;
&#13;
 involved and with the financial sector people in that part&#13;
&#13;
 of the group.    And based on your comments, we have also&#13;
&#13;
 enhanced our collaboration with the IFC in this.           So,&#13;
&#13;
 there is general buy-in in those groups.&#13;

&#13;
            Everybody in a sense has been heard through the&#13;
&#13;
 process.   So, inasmuch as the Operations Policy Committee&#13;
&#13;
 which represents senior management has cleared this, there&#13;
&#13;
 is buy-in from that area.     But there are clearly some&#13;
&#13;
 groups where we have had much closer collaboration and&#13;
&#13;
 much closer direct inputs from these groups.&#13;
&#13;
            The ILO has been involved in the preparation of&#13;
&#13;
 this document both as a reviewer but also in early&#13;
&#13;
 discussions of the concept.     In fact, the U.K. Government&#13;
&#13;
 helped us a lot by convening a meeting of a number of&#13;
&#13;
 countries and international agencies including the Asian&#13;
&#13;
 Development Bank, UNICEF, UNDP and ILO to discuss our&#13;
&#13;
 different approaches.    And there is a common trend&#13;
&#13;
 inasmuch as everybody recognizes the role of risk and the&#13;
&#13;
 role of redistribution.    I think based on historical&#13;
&#13;
 reasons and based on our different mandates, we put&#13;
&#13;
 slightly different emphases on those two elements.           But&#13;
&#13;
 those two elements are in all these agency strategies on&#13;
&#13;
 social protection at the moment.&#13;
&#13;
            As regards the IMF, we have a distinguished&#13;
&#13;
 member on the IMF External Advisory Panel.           We presented&#13;
&#13;
 this to IMF staff in the Fiscal Affairs Department,&#13;
&#13;
 sponsored by them.   So, they are aware.           We have taken&#13;
&#13;

                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 their comments into concern.      Whether there is complete&#13;
&#13;
 buy-in, I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
           Whether social risk management is compatible&#13;
&#13;
 with social policy, we think it is.        There is one&#13;
&#13;
 outstanding issue that again I think will require Board&#13;
&#13;
 discussion before the Bank gets into this, which is the&#13;
&#13;
 area of social rights.    I think that is something that we&#13;
&#13;
 have not addressed explicitly here because it is something&#13;
&#13;
 that needs to be discussed by the Board carefully before&#13;
&#13;
 we go forward on that.&#13;
&#13;
           As regards the new Children's Initiatives Fund,&#13;
&#13;
 let me start by stressing that this is not a proposal.&#13;
&#13;
 What we have found with our partners is that there is a&#13;
&#13;
 certain frustration with the current approach we are&#13;
&#13;
 taking.   So, together with ILO and UNICEF we have been&#13;
&#13;
 banding around ideas of how we could do more and do better&#13;
&#13;
 in this area.&#13;
&#13;
           While we recognize the most important thing is&#13;
&#13;
 that parents get out of poverty -- that is the way you&#13;
&#13;
 reduce child labor -- we are finding based on the&#13;
&#13;
 experience of the ILO and UNICEF that there are specific&#13;
&#13;
 interventions that you can do to help.         And we really need&#13;
&#13;
 a way of doing this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
            If it ever were to become a reality, it would&#13;
&#13;
 have to go through all the checks that are here in the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank, and we would not propose the Bank to take the lead&#13;
&#13;
 on this.   This would be an initiative driven probably&#13;
&#13;
 primarily by UNICEF but in discussion between UNICEF and&#13;
&#13;
 the ILO.&#13;
&#13;
            This also leads us to the question of the&#13;
&#13;
 overall issue of division of labor and who does what.        We&#13;
&#13;
 have tried to outline a process here.         I think it is only&#13;
&#13;
 fair to say that many of our key international partners&#13;
&#13;
 are in a state of flux at the moment.         There is new&#13;
&#13;
 leadership in the ILO and in the UNDP that is really&#13;
&#13;
 changing the way they are doing.       So, the best we can do&#13;
&#13;
 now is to keep the dialogue open and find out, as we&#13;
&#13;
 progress, each of us through our change processes where&#13;
&#13;
 will our comparative advantages be.        They may not be what&#13;
&#13;
 they were two years ago.&#13;
&#13;
            In terms of the UN overall, we have been honored&#13;
&#13;
 in that the UN Commission for Social Development has&#13;
&#13;
 decided that its topic for next year's session will be&#13;
&#13;
 social protection.   And we are very actively working with&#13;
&#13;
 the secretariat, especially in two upcoming meetings, one&#13;
&#13;
 in Berlin and one in Capetown, in preparation for that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 meeting.   And so, again, I think there is buy-in in the&#13;
&#13;
 sense that these are important issues to discuss, but we&#13;
&#13;
 come with different approaches.        And that is what is&#13;
&#13;
 beneficial and what makes it possible to get good&#13;
&#13;
 partnerships in this area.&#13;
&#13;
            We agree that the country-based approach leads&#13;
&#13;
 to work closely with the regional development banks.&#13;
&#13;
 Again, we have worked very closely with the Asian&#13;
&#13;
 Development Bank on development of strategies, on the&#13;
&#13;
 Inter-American Development Bank on both actual reforms and&#13;
&#13;
 strategies.   In fact, we also are working on joint&#13;
&#13;
 training programs for staff with some of these.       With the&#13;
&#13;
 African Development Bank it has more been in the area of&#13;
&#13;
 social funds and the whole area of microfinance, but again&#13;
&#13;
 very close collaboration and collaboration in the sense&#13;
&#13;
 that sometimes they take the lead, sometimes we take the&#13;
&#13;
 lead, depending on the specific circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
            You are absolutely right that we need to say&#13;
&#13;
 that microfinance failed within social protection&#13;
&#13;
 programs, not in general.      I think that is a mistake which&#13;
&#13;
 we will correct.&#13;
&#13;
            We are concerned, like you are, about the skills&#13;
&#13;
 mix issue.    That is an important issue and, in fact, we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 are working very closely with the World Bank Institute on&#13;
&#13;
 this.   We want to try and not train staff in isolation&#13;
&#13;
 from their partners in the client countries.        So, what we&#13;
&#13;
 are going for is a training program that will have this&#13;
&#13;
 joint training of clients and staff, and it was piloted&#13;
&#13;
 successfully in the pensions area and we want to expand it&#13;
&#13;
 to our other areas.&#13;
&#13;
            I think I already addressed the buy-in from the&#13;
&#13;
 wider world and so on.     The portfolio that we have, like I&#13;
&#13;
 said, you are absolutely right that there are some&#13;
&#13;
 emerging signs of worry, but again still it is one of the&#13;
&#13;
 best performing portfolios of any sector in the Bank, and&#13;
&#13;
 we see that as one of our primary objectives to keep it&#13;
&#13;
 that way, even in spite of the rapid expansion.       We know&#13;
&#13;
 from other sectors that expanded so rapidly, the rural&#13;
&#13;
 sector, the education sector that we are headed for&#13;
&#13;
 trouble.   And we are aware of it and the Sector Board has&#13;
&#13;
 taken that very seriously and is addressing it.&#13;
&#13;
            We have, in fact, been working very closely with&#13;
&#13;
 agriculture, rural development, disaster management.       I am&#13;
&#13;
 glad that one African chair liked the approach we have&#13;
&#13;
 taken on Africa.   I think we recognize the importance of&#13;
&#13;
 this, the context of Africa, but we would rather not over-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 promise on this.   There are countries that have expressed&#13;
&#13;
 an interest, want to work on this and we want to start&#13;
&#13;
 there and get it right.&#13;
&#13;
           We could make grand statements, but we would&#13;
&#13;
 rather try and do it in partnership with those country&#13;
&#13;
 governments.   And we feel that these countries are ready&#13;
&#13;
 to go and, in fact, many of them have already moved on it.&#13;
&#13;
           On the question of the poorest of the poor and&#13;
&#13;
 the lack of information, I can say nothing else but you&#13;
&#13;
 are absolutely right.     And that is one of the areas we are&#13;
&#13;
 working on.    And that may be why we may have made too&#13;
&#13;
 strong statements on all the means of targeting.     But I&#13;
&#13;
 think really what we are very excited about at the moment&#13;
&#13;
 and we want to do some more evaluations on is the issue of&#13;
&#13;
 community-based targeting.      It does seem like communities&#13;
&#13;
 are able to identify the poorest of the poor within those&#13;
&#13;
 communities.   And there is some emerging evidence from the&#13;
&#13;
 crisis in East Asia that that is possible to do it that&#13;
&#13;
 way.   But again, these are early days.&#13;
&#13;
           On the digital divide, you are absolutely right,&#13;
&#13;
 that it will create more opportunities and more risk.     We&#13;
&#13;
 do have experience from dealing with the East Asia crisis&#13;
&#13;
 and the fallout in other countries of dealing with these,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 not necessarily the poorest people.         So, I think there are&#13;
&#13;
 some experiences there that we can learn from that, and&#13;
&#13;
 that will be important for this.&#13;
&#13;
             I also think we are very excited about the role&#13;
&#13;
 that information technology could be on passing&#13;
&#13;
 information onto poor people.       I think what we often focus&#13;
&#13;
 is the passing on of resources.        But information is what&#13;
&#13;
 often they need, especially in a globalizing world.&#13;
&#13;
             A farmer in the remotest village in Africa today&#13;
&#13;
 is affected by world market prices.         At least to get the&#13;
&#13;
 information out there what is happening in those markets&#13;
&#13;
 could be critical.    And I don't think we have exploited&#13;
&#13;
 the role of information technology in that respect yet.           I&#13;
&#13;
 don't know what the exact solutions are, but there is&#13;
&#13;
 clearly something that needs to be looked at.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, on breaking down the barriers between&#13;
&#13;
 economic and social, interestingly enough one of our&#13;
&#13;
 advisory panel members took this framework back to his&#13;
&#13;
 home country and he said "I am part of the Social Cabinet;&#13;
&#13;
 we never get to speak to the economic part of the&#13;
&#13;
 Cabinet".    But with this framework he did manage to get&#13;
&#13;
 that dialogue going with the economic side of the Cabinet.&#13;
&#13;
 So, at least in one country context it did help break down&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                     Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 those barriers.   I think it is also important to stress&#13;
&#13;
 that in a matrix organization we work very closely with&#13;
&#13;
 the other networks.    Obviously we have some areas that we&#13;
&#13;
 are accountable for and responsible for, but there are&#13;
&#13;
 other areas where we cannot do it alone.           And I think we&#13;
&#13;
 all recognize that in the context.&#13;
&#13;
           I just remembered that there was one specific&#13;
&#13;
 question how we reach some of the numbers in the table.&#13;
&#13;
 There was a question raised on how we reached the 5&#13;
&#13;
 percent of spending, 2 percent of GDP as a target.          That&#13;
&#13;
 is what we currently know is appropriate for some of the&#13;
&#13;
 countries that have done best on safety nets.          But again,&#13;
&#13;
 that number will be revised based on experience.          But that&#13;
&#13;
 is what we currently know about it, and it is a very&#13;
&#13;
 partial answer to the really big question of how much is&#13;
&#13;
 enough and how much is sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
           And finally also, there were several written&#13;
&#13;
 statements who called on OED for more evaluation of social&#13;
&#13;
 protection.   I want to recognize that and I hope you will&#13;
&#13;
 help us push this.    We feel the evaluation of social funds&#13;
&#13;
 is an important beginning, but there is really so much&#13;
&#13;
 more of social protection that requires a good evaluation,&#13;
&#13;
 especially in view of this exploding portfolio.          So, we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                        735 8th Street, S.E.&#13;
                    Washington, D.C. 20003-2802&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 very much welcome your support in encouraging our&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues in OED to move forward on that.&#13;
&#13;
           There was one more thing on instruments, that we&#13;
&#13;
 may not have the appropriate instruments.            We may not, but&#13;
&#13;
 we have an obligation to use the current instruments as&#13;
&#13;
 far as we can.   And we feel we have not fully exploited&#13;
&#13;
 the current instruments to the maximum.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ZHANG:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Please, Jan.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:     Very briefly, I just wanted to&#13;
&#13;
 respond to that point on OED since OED does report to the&#13;
&#13;
 Board.   And as chair of CODE, I would say I will undertake&#13;
&#13;
 to follow this up because there have been several comments&#13;
&#13;
 by Board members.&#13;
&#13;
           I know that OED this year, again operating&#13;
&#13;
 itself within a constrained budget, undertook a process of&#13;
&#13;
 trying to sequence and prioritize what it did.           And it is&#13;
&#13;
 true that some of the evaluations in the social area went&#13;
&#13;
 further toward the horizon.       They had been indicated&#13;
&#13;
 earlier but were put off.       And we can revisit that I think&#13;
&#13;
 in light of this discussion.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
           MR. ZHANG:   That is very helpful.          Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
 Well, let's see if you answered all the questions.           Are&#13;
&#13;
 there any other questions?&#13;
&#13;
           [No response.]&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ZHANG:   If not, let me try to pull together&#13;
&#13;
 a few of the key points as I understand were made during&#13;
&#13;
 the discussion.&#13;
&#13;
           First, let me say to the extent that the advice&#13;
&#13;
 and suggestions were offered as to how we shall manage,&#13;
&#13;
 indeed even write, these sector strategy papers, let me&#13;
&#13;
 say that, if you recall, six sector strategy papers we&#13;
&#13;
 have put to the Board, and we have about four or five in&#13;
&#13;
 the pipeline.&#13;
&#13;
           As you all know, I think it is probably fair to&#13;
&#13;
 say that we have learned along the way.            We have committed&#13;
&#13;
 to the Board that we will do a retrospective or review of&#13;
&#13;
 the experience so far, but I think in this particular&#13;
&#13;
 case, a lot of effort, I think as Steen mentioned, went&#13;
&#13;
 into it, both at the experts' level as well as corporate&#13;
&#13;
 level.   At the corporate level, I think both the OPC and&#13;
&#13;
 senior management looked at it a couple of times.           So, I&#13;
&#13;
 just wanted to assure you to the extent that this is not&#13;
&#13;
 perfect, as it is not, we are learning along the way.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Going forward, I think first that the team&#13;
&#13;
 should go through the transcripts for the many good and&#13;
&#13;
 key points and issues made during the discussion, as we&#13;
&#13;
 proceed to implement the strategy, even though I fully&#13;
&#13;
 recognize Steen seemed to have answered quite a number of&#13;
&#13;
 the points, but I think inevitable in a discussion that&#13;
&#13;
 lasted two-and-a-half hours, there must be more than I&#13;
&#13;
 think staff responded to.&#13;
&#13;
           I think as the Board usually does advise, the&#13;
&#13;
 key is clearly to focus on now translating the framework&#13;
&#13;
 into concrete actions, bearing in mind the guidance and&#13;
&#13;
 provisos that the EDs offered during the discussion.        To&#13;
&#13;
 this end -- and I fully agree -- adequate knowledge,&#13;
&#13;
 proper understanding and full attention by staff and&#13;
&#13;
 managers down the line will be critical to the success and&#13;
&#13;
 proper and effective implementation of the paper.&#13;
&#13;
           We will closely monitor the experience both to&#13;
&#13;
 ensure real-time learning but also in fact to adopt such&#13;
&#13;
 adjustments as necessary and ensure also cross&#13;
&#13;
 fertilization.   I think we will take up Jan's offer to see&#13;
&#13;
 if we can get OED to help us in that regard and to get a&#13;
&#13;
 different and independent perspective.         I will also say&#13;
&#13;
 maybe QAG can also contribute in that regard.        I think the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Box ---]&#13;
&#13;
 worst thing that could happen to us and more to the client&#13;
&#13;
 is simply not to do it right.&#13;
&#13;
           I also fully agree that we need to ensure full&#13;
&#13;
 coordination and partnership with the other donors and&#13;
&#13;
 partners, particularly the IMF, given the widened scope of&#13;
&#13;
 the subject.   I think it has to be based on the clarity of&#13;
&#13;
 responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
           Now here I think, as usual, we will need to&#13;
&#13;
 proceed, making sure first that we have to give due&#13;
&#13;
 consideration to the issue of the importance of&#13;
&#13;
 comparative advantage among the different institutions.&#13;
&#13;
 Second is I think the issue of selectivity within the&#13;
&#13;
 institution.   I think the latter point is probably of&#13;
&#13;
 particular practical importance and urgency for our&#13;
&#13;
 institution at this moment and for some time to come.&#13;
&#13;
           And I think we will need also the Board's help&#13;
&#13;
 in that regard.&#13;
&#13;
           As requested, we will provide an update in about&#13;
&#13;
 one year's or more time on the implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy and I would probably venture to say that update&#13;
&#13;
 does not necessarily have to take the form of a paper.     I&#13;
&#13;
 think we could also do so through other appropriate&#13;
&#13;
 acceptable means, but I think the key is to make sure that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 the Board is kept posted on the progress and problems as a&#13;
&#13;
 result of the implementation that will take place going&#13;
&#13;
 forward.&#13;
&#13;
             So with this, I hope we basically captured the&#13;
&#13;
 key points.    And, as I said, clearly there were more than&#13;
&#13;
 that and we will look at the transcript so that the full&#13;
&#13;
 justice is done to the serious attention and effort that&#13;
&#13;
 you have given to this paper for which we are very&#13;
&#13;
 grateful.&#13;
&#13;
             All right.   Thank you very much.&#13;
