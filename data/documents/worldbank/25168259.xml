1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in&#13;
this Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the&#13;
Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration&#13;
Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its&#13;
Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies,&#13;
its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the&#13;
use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to&#13;
the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the&#13;
United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the&#13;
Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders&#13;
of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall&#13;
be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may&#13;
be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as&#13;
trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency&#13;
other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying&#13;
Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange&#13;
rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to&#13;
complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall&#13;
bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date&#13;
of the conversion.&#13;

2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of&#13;

Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;

3.1    The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
3.2    The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.   Within six (6) months after all&#13;

closed, the final financial information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the&#13;
Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;

auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-&#13;
based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds&#13;
together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be&#13;
borne by the Bank.&#13;
3.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether&#13;
such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope&#13;
and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the&#13;
Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs&#13;
of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;

year. The progress reports shall be provided with reference to the results framework agreed by the&#13;
Bank and the Donor, as such results framework may be reviewed by the Parties from time to time.&#13;
Within (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as defined below), the Bank shall provide to the&#13;
Donors a final progress report for the Trust Fund.&#13;

closure of the Trust Fund. The Donor and the Bank shall agree on the scope and conduct of such&#13;
review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of the&#13;
Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the&#13;
Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not&#13;
constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;

5.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank&#13;
by December 31, 2023 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to&#13;
Donors) after such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to&#13;
the Administration Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank&#13;
shall return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the&#13;
manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the&#13;
total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
5.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel&#13;
all or any Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions&#13;
(paid and not yet paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the&#13;
Bank and any consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration&#13;
Agreement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a&#13;
cancellation, the Bank shall return to the Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding Currency as&#13;
specified in the Administration Agreement unless otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;

Trust Fund in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into&#13;
Administration Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration&#13;
Agreements and such related information.&#13;
6.2    The Donors and the Bank shall use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute,&#13;
controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
7.     Grants to Recipients&#13;

more grant agreements (the "Grant Agreements") with recipients (the "Recipients") consistent with&#13;
the purposes of this Administration Agreement and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant&#13;
Agreements.  Grant Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum     amount of the&#13;
Contributions that all Donors have agreed to make available under the Administration Agreements&#13;
between the Bank and the Donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-9-&#13;
7.2    The Bank shall calculate a fee each time funds (the "Grant Amount") from the Trust Fund&#13;
become committed under a Grant Agreement. Such commitment shall occur when such Grant&#13;
Agreement is fully countersigned (the "Calculation Date"). The fee so calculated by the Bank shall&#13;
be based on the cumulative total of funds from the Trust Fund committed under all Grant&#13;
Agreements that have been fully countersigned on or prior to the Calculation Date (the "Cumulative&#13;
Grant Total"). The calculated fee shall depend on where the Cumulative Grant Total stands as the&#13;
Grant Amount is added and shall be determined in accordance with the following schedule:&#13;
(i)    5% of any portion of the Grant Amount that results in a Cumulative Grant Total&#13;
below or equal to US$ 50 million; plus&#13;

above US$ 50 million and below or equal to US$ 500 million; plus&#13;
(iii)  3% of any portion of the Grant Amount that results in a Cumulative Grant Total&#13;
above US$ 500 million and below or equal to US$ 1 billion; plus&#13;
(iv)   2% of any portion of the Grant Amount that results in a Cumulative Grant Total&#13;
above US$ 1 billion.&#13;
Following each Calculation Date, the Bank shall deduct from the Trust Fund, and retain for its own&#13;
account, the fee as set forth above. Grant Amounts may not exceed the balance of uncommitted&#13;
funds in the Trust Fund net of the related fee.&#13;
7.3    The Bank shall be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under any Grant&#13;
Agreements. Subject to the consent of any relevant Recipients, representatives of the Donors may be&#13;
invited by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
7.4    The Bank shall promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the terms of&#13;
any Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under any&#13;
Grant Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank shall afford the Donors the opportunity to&#13;
exchange views before effecting any such modification or exercising any such remedy.&#13;
