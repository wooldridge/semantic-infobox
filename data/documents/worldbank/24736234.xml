COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT&#13;
relating to&#13;
Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is en:ered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   THE STANDARD BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA (with its registered office at 5 Simmonds St e&#13;
Johannesburg, South Africa, 2001) represented by its Chief Executive: Corporate Investm!r t&#13;
Banking ("Standard Bank"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUF1, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPIh E HI'&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), heacquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, US , le&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvar i.&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC U: 133,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Inter i  t, nal&#13;
Organizations (IOs), the G77 and the private sector represented by the B20 that investin;1 in the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to a i nd&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic c ": /th&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on  :i: ing&#13;
sources of infrastructure finance-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and cooin :1 mted&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize p,ivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robLst pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects an( : 3 is&#13;
understood to be the greates! barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investm it&#13;
(D) Governments, development f nance institutions, donors, and private investors share an inl )E t in&#13;
developing the market for private infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand sid , in&#13;
the numbers of structurally sc:und and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual emi r-.: ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a ecognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range o Ir ate&#13;
investors that actively participate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will ItE  efit&#13;
from collective action betwe:,n this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowl :,I( to&#13;
find  solutions  to  complex  infrastructure  financing  challenges  that no  single  institutio i c  uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure F ., ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF") The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at levera( iin(g the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruct 11: vith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prep m E on,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigation for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard,  : 31F&#13;
aims to complement existin(i and proposed services and initiatives currently supportec  the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepE  , ell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure prcjects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces! iii(i the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro! pe: tive&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater i!e ege&#13;
of official resources in the face of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular f :&gt;i rge&#13;
and complex projects with the potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interested in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure F E ility&#13;
Partnership Program, together with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have coma to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended to be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set or i&#13;
Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Fo,indational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the 31F Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their collai ct r: ion,&#13;
they are of an indicative nature and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties anc \i:&#13;
other potential partners until the GIF is formally established. The final version of these obje c ti .s&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to further enhance their coordination, in particular by developing I iIF,&#13;
with a view to formally establishing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the foregoing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue t:&#13;
collaborate in developing the GIF, including but not limited to:&#13;
a. Nature and scope of collaboration under the GIF, such as proposed categories of&#13;
partnership and the rDles, rights, and responsibilities associated with each catego y&#13;
b. Governance arrangeTents of the GIF;&#13;
c. Operational policies applicable to the GIF's operations;&#13;
d. Scope of GIF activities and sources/uses of GIF funds, including approach to projl I&#13;

e. Any other aspects of collaboration required to finalize the design of the GIF, incluc ic&#13;
sharing best practice and experience with regard to project preparation, through tl Eu ;e&#13;
of knowledge platforms for the infrastructure sector.&#13;
2.2   During the process of finali.:ing the design of the GIF, the multilateral development ban ., i ;ted&#13;
in Annex 2 will be  invited io  participate as initial Technical Partners. Once the GIF d:: i: i is&#13;
finalized, additional collaborative efforts are required to develop the operational detail, ci the&#13;
GIF, at all times complementing existing efforts and facilities and building upon the t 1red&#13;
knowledge and experience of the Parties in this area. This includes determining the !  I of&#13;
coordination between the Parties and project origination process.&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Prelirinary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the 31F is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure p c.: .ts&#13;
in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparat :-&#13;
provision of appropriate risk initigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commerciz :i&#13;
institutional investor engagement in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex public-private partnerships and projects with potential for comme&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastrL ox 3&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coon i ui ion&#13;
resources in collaboration wi,h the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of t&amp;: v, de&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMD:&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engageme il &lt; uld&#13;
stretch from upstream support on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to downstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risl&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancement.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structurE Id&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GIF can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset class attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long 1la n&#13;
assets in faster growing ecoromies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profilE -&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to oDerate according to the following core principles, to be firalizi c  on&#13;
agreement among GIF partne?rs:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities t ,a t iill&#13;
draw together comparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing public goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thosi&#13;
infrastructure projects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sustainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to I Es:&#13;
practice standards for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing t1ch ical&#13;
and financial resources of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities mu :i ral&#13;
development ins:itutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in ar&#13;
innovative and flexible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greati r&#13;
leverage and ad:Jress the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the resources of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in 1 t&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF p ir:r rs&#13;
are expected to fall into one or more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partners-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wi i&#13;
considered Fund ng Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partners-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice and support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-fundE:&#13;
activities and/or provision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity supp&lt; r&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partne rs-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/:r institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sovereign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as wil I&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure projects, to be invited into discussions related to project prepara inr&#13;
optimal approacf es to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional investment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmir -j&#13;
management and use of funds, and development of operational policies and procedures; r nd&#13;
hold the GIF Management Unit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, wit- advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compo i c 1 of&#13;
the Governing Council will bE agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is prop:, =' to&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Counc I comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Dir !:&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer o: the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facili : le&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve ;,;;&#13;
sounding board, providing gLidance and support for GIF Management, and in particular w :1&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be admi-iistered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicate I :E m&#13;
established for this purpose (the GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will ft n: &gt;n&#13;
as a coordinating body as projects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then moN e&#13;
toward technical support and financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead in li i: ual&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implementation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical PartnE&#13;
institutions, coordinated by tf e GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governme 113,&#13;
according to specific project requirements and the project origination processes. Compos Ji:) of&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and gove ri mts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection citeria and processes could be developed to reflect the follo I,&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Impact-projects that support the development goals of the G1&#13;
partner institutions;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-prciects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities an:&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-projects that require multiple parties to come together to provid:&#13;
structuring, arranging and financial support, and/or projects which require a b l -I: of&#13;
financial instruments; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial t al ility,&#13;
leverage public funds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- s u: I&#13;
as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's seivice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastr,cture investments that have global public good characteristit sich&#13;
as climate friendly-projects that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisior 1f&#13;
infrastructure services; and trade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconne::1  y&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of support provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with  aw&#13;
to complementing the resourc es and support already available from partner entities arid oi li&#13;
funding mechanisms. During the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac li il 3s,&#13;
corresponding to major proje:A development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; pro ect definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr :r ng;&#13;
and legal, regula-:ory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii)  Project preparation and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PPIP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, anc: design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangiig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financ n;-&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies- ncluding in particular the management of environmental and l: l&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastr i:t. -e&#13;
projects in supporting sustairable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supportec operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements r&#13;
external implementing entities under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an approach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards ani :1 er&#13;
standards and policies, and develop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for G&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activitiei .&#13;
