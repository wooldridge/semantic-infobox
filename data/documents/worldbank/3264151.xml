&#13;
The PRSP process is continually evolving as countries and their development partners learn from&#13;
early experience. In the January 2002 Comprehensive Review of the PRSP Process, a number of&#13;
donors and democracy organizations indicated concern with the relatively weak involvement of&#13;
existing democratic and representative institutions in PRSP formulation, implementation, and&#13;
evaluation.1 Previously, legislative involvement had occurred mostly informally through&#13;
participation of individual legislators acting in their individual capacities as political leaders: thus,&#13;
knowledge of the PRSP process by legislators and legislative staff remained generally weak.&#13;
However, as implementation of a country's PRSP often requires the legislature to approve national&#13;
budgets and pass legislation, lack of parliamentary awareness in PRSP formulation can lead to&#13;
problems in PRSP implementation over time.&#13;
&#13;
This annex is designed to assist those involved in poverty reduction strategies with identifying and&#13;
implementing activities and programs that will integrate existing democratic institutions, namely the&#13;
national assembly or parliament, into poverty reduction efforts, thus strengthening the impact and&#13;
sustainability of each country's PRSP. As such, it is intended to be a tool for Bank and Fund staff,&#13;
national PRSP commission members, members or staff of parliament, or other actors seeking to unite&#13;
a country's economic and democratic transitions. Through analysis, checklists, and activity options,&#13;
the annex highlights specific mechanisms by which parliaments can strengthen the PRSP process and&#13;
reinforce its positive outcomes, including through greater involvement in poverty diagnosis, policy&#13;
development, PRSP implementation, and evaluation/monitoring. For ease of use, it has been&#13;
organized in keeping with the PRSP cycle. Consequently, sections two, three, four, and five address&#13;
opportunities for legislative involvement in poverty diagnosis, policy formulation, implementation,&#13;
and monitoring and evaluation, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
It is worth noting that while numerous mechanisms for parliamentary involvement are detailed in the&#13;
following pages, the specific activity level relevant to a particular national parliament must be&#13;
determined by its own characteristics and capacitates. Rather than detail an explicit plan for&#13;
enhancing parliamentary engagement with the PRSP, this annex intends to provide a menu of&#13;
options, from among which appropriate activities may be selected.&#13;

1As noted in the Main Findings Document of the Comprehensive Review of the Poverty Reduction Strategy&#13;
Paper (PRSP) Approach a number of development partners (notably the Utstein group of bilateral donors) have expressed&#13;
concern over the fact that, "the role of parliaments in the preparation, approval, and monitoring of country strategies has&#13;
generally been limited and is a concern that has been expressed." (Main Findings document; prepared by the staffs of the&#13;
World Bank and the IMF, approved by Gobind Nankani and Masood Ahmed, March 2002).&#13;

      1. Rationale for Integration of Parliaments into PRSP Process&#13;
&#13;
State institutions have a key role to play in the growth or stagnation of any national economy. In&#13;
recent years, global studies examining the possible correlation between specific political institutions&#13;
and fiscal outcomes, financial market regulation, and trade regulation have demonstrated that&#13;
countries with adequate institutional checks and balances are more likely to enforce national&#13;
financial regulations and policies.2 In this light, the role of the legislature as an institutional check on&#13;
executive branch policy decisions and PRSP implementation takes on added importance. Greater&#13;
parliamentary involvement in the PRSP process helps to ensure that a country's poverty strategy is&#13;
generated, implemented, and evaluated through national institutions with adequate political&#13;
legitimacy to ensure ownership and sustainability. This section explores the benefits, as well as&#13;
challenges, of greater parliamentary involvement in the PRSP process. It moves on to discuss entry&#13;
points for strengthening parliament's role with respect to the PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
1.1 Parliamentary Involvement Reinforces Core Principles of PRSP&#13;
&#13;
An examination of the core principles underlying the PRSP demonstrates how effective&#13;
legislativinvolvement reinforces the potential for efficient, sustainable economic development.3&#13;
Although limited parliamentary capacity in most PRSP countries limits legislatures in their ability to&#13;
make significant initial contributions to the PRSP process, incremental efforts to involve the&#13;
legislature can gradually strengthen the practices needed to actualize core PRSP principles.&#13;
&#13;
  Participatory, country driven and owned: Under most constitutions, legislatures are the most&#13;
   representative element of a country's national government. Although in many cases this&#13;
   representative potential has been latent or underutilized due to political conditions or lack of&#13;
   resources, parliaments remain a mechanism for channeling citizen's input into national poverty&#13;
   reduction policies and ensuring cooperation from a variety of political actors. Depending on&#13;
   popular perceptions of the parliament and MP credibility, the representative responsibilities of&#13;
   parliament, as assigned by each country's constitution, may provide a greater level of ownership&#13;
   and legitimacy than other participatory methods.&#13;
&#13;
  Results-oriented: The PRSP process is grounded in the idea that the creation of a strategy for&#13;
   poverty reduction will establish realistic targets and clear objectives to pursue in implementation.&#13;
   Once the strategy has been solidified however, enabling legislation or legal reform may be&#13;
   required before executive officials can pursue implementation. In countries where legislatures&#13;
   have significant budgetary role, the national assembly has even greater potential to affect a&#13;
   country's adherence to established poverty reduction strategies through its allocation of resources&#13;
   to implementing ministries.&#13;
&#13;
  Comprehensive: Considering the geographic spread, political composition, and sector-specific&#13;
   committee structure of national parliaments, legislatures (and legislative structures) offer a&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
3Clarification of terminology: While acknowledging the differing role of the legislative branch in presidential&#13;
   and parliamentary systems, for purposes of linguistic variety, this document uses the terms "parliament"&#13;
   and "legislature" interchangeably. It is important to note however, that the constitutionally mandated role of&#13;
   a national legislative assembly varies from country to country, and has great impact on the nature of that&#13;
   branch's involvement in the PRSP process.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                  Parliaments and the PRSP Process   3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   potential space in which to debate a nationally comprehensive view of poverty and impacts of&#13;
   poverty reduction initiatives. Even if parliamentary debate is motivated by geographic- or&#13;
   constituency-specific interests, the airing of such views can contribute to a more comprehensive&#13;
   national poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
  Prioritized for feasible implementation: Prioritization of poverty reduction objectives may be the&#13;
   most politically charged element of the PRSP. While economic factors and rational decision-&#13;
   making can logically prioritize policy actions in favor of certain regions or sectors, such decisions&#13;
   have significant impact on popular support for the political parties or individuals in executive&#13;
   offices. Parliaments, which typically include a range of political actors and are vested with&#13;
   constitutional authority to serve as a check on the decisions of the executive, may serve to&#13;
   balance the ruling party's political interests in PRSP formulation. Engaging the parliament in the&#13;
   PRSP prioritization process acknowledges the political impact of economic decisions, which may&#13;
   result in more effective implementation.&#13;
&#13;
  Partnership-orientation: Effective partnership between IFIs, other development partners, and PRSP&#13;
   countries depends, in part, on the transparency of the PRSP process. Through such standard legis-&#13;
   lative activities as committee hearings and reports, national assemblies may facilitate donor coor-&#13;
   dination by contributing to the transparency of the PRSP development, financing, and implemen-&#13;
   tation process.&#13;
&#13;
  Based on medium- and long-term perspectives: Despite MPs' tendency to focus on short-term per-&#13;
   spectives, building non-partisan support for poverty reduction strategies among present and future&#13;
   national leaders can engender greater continuity in the medium- and long-term. Because the&#13;
   PRSP process takes place within a political environment, broad support for the PRSP by Mem-&#13;
   bers of parliament (MPs) from both governing and opposition parties is important in ensuring that&#13;
   the PRSP's success will not be derailed by changes in the political environment. In most PRSP&#13;
   countries, national parliaments include representatives of all major political factions, and there-&#13;
   fore provide an ideal forum for multi-partisan inclusion.&#13;
&#13;
1.2 Linking PRSP Activities with Existing Contexts and Capacities&#13;
&#13;
When assessing the possible opportunities for legislative involvement in the PRSP process, it is criti-&#13;
cal to consider the specific context in which the parliament operates and to be realistic regarding&#13;
technical and professional capacities. Legislative authority to introduce legislation, amend budgets or&#13;
bills proposed by the executive, or even reject tabled legislation varies with a country's constitutional&#13;
structure and tradition of political party discipline or control. Further, political and economic condi-&#13;
tions mean that national legislatures in many PRSP countries lack the institutional capacities needed&#13;
for effective engagement. In countries where dramatic political or economic changes have recently&#13;
occurred (e.g., military coup, civil war or unrest, hyper inflation, death or removal of a dictator, un-&#13;
precedented political opening or reform, etc), basic legislative activity is a challenge for nascent or&#13;
evolving institutions and the people inside them. Lack of fundamental infrastructure (offices and&#13;
office equipment, reference materials, staff, consistent utilities), restricted access to data or&#13;
inaccurate information, scarcity of leadership experience by legislative bodies, illiteracy levels, and&#13;
limited knowledge of sitting MPs all inhibit a parliament's ability to play an active role in the PRSP&#13;
process. The extent and nature of parliamentary integration into the PRSP process must take these&#13;
factors into account, lest PRSP requirements become an unmanageable demand on legislative&#13;
resources.&#13;

While capacity constraints limit the legislature's contribution&#13;
to the PRSP process, targeted technical support and                  Assessment Checklist for Country-Specific&#13;
incremental integration of standard legislative practices into           Parliamentary Involvement in PRSP&#13;

poverty reduction strategies, but also enhances the                   of this particular parliament?&#13;
parliament's eventual capacity to fulfill oversight and               Is there a coalition government or a single&#13;

                                                                      majority?&#13;
  Minimal capacity: Even where nascent legislatures have              Can governing and opposition parties&#13;
    little internal capacity to analyze the policies contained in     collaborate on issue specific initiatives or&#13;
    the PRSP, the legislature can still serve as a forum to build     is the relationship too combative?&#13;

  Limited staff resources: Where committee systems have               What is the status of parliamentary&#13;
    defined roles and assigned support staff but those staff lack     capacity and/or resources? Do members&#13;
    the technical skills necessary to support meaningful              or staff have access to computers and the&#13;

    providing immediate technical support, this strategy can be       individual members?&#13;
    an entry point for building staff capacity.                       Is there staff to support committee&#13;

1.3 Overview of Entry Points for Parliamentary Involvement&#13;
&#13;
With the understanding that parliamentary involvement can reinforce the core principles of the&#13;
PRSP, much work has been done to identify the conceptual role that parliaments can play in PRSP&#13;
processes. These potential points of involvement for parliaments in the PRSP process will vary from&#13;
country to country and across the four components of the PRSP cycle: 1. Poverty diagnosis, 2. PRSP&#13;
development, 3. Implementation of PRSP, and 4. Monitoring of PRSP implementation and&#13;
evaluation of PRSP priorities.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                            Parliaments and the PRSP Process                 5&#13;

Note: Multiple actors are already involved in each stage of the PRSP process - civil society, IFIs, local government,&#13;
the ministry of Finance, Sector-specific Ministries, even the academic community each have specific roles to play. In&#13;
an effort to highlight just a few of the points at which a national legislature might strengthen the PRSP through their&#13;
own activity, this diagram has been highly simplified. Though the basic order of the PRSP process has been&#13;
preserved, the actions of other players has been omitted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    However, if the participatory elements of the PRSP are to become an enduring part of any country's&#13;
    policy process, engagement of existing governing institutions (such as the legislature) is eventually&#13;
    necessary at all stages.4&#13;

            Understanding the Non-quantitative Aspects of Poverty&#13;

ity (or are currently undergoing decentralization        In Nigeria, a workshop originally intended to explore&#13;
processes), MPs have a role to play in the empow-        methods to promote legislative-executive communi-&#13;
erment of citizens and citizen groups. In these in-      cation on the PRSP led MPs to launch a deeper dis-&#13;

roots of poverty in a country could include parlia-      divisions.&#13;
mentary input regarding poverty's non-&#13;
quantitative aspects.&#13;
&#13;
In PRSP countries at varying levels of political development, parliamentarians already gather&#13;
information relevant to poverty diagnosis. Although limited staff, resources, capacity, and political&#13;
space all inhibit MPs' interaction with citizens and citizen groups, deputies can be a logical conduit&#13;
for gathering demographic data from sector specific NGOs, or more basic information on popular&#13;
perceptions of poverty, through constituency relations, collaboration with local NGO's, or even&#13;
meetings with local groups or individuals. While MP access to accurate statistical information may&#13;
be limited, in part because PRSP country parliaments are unlikely to have sufficient staff resources&#13;
to devote to gathering or reviewing demographic data, deputies are well positioned to communicate&#13;
the perceptions of citizens and citizen groups in their home districts. In many places, MPs' direct&#13;
contact with constituents or personal experience in their electoral district provides them with a more&#13;
accurate sense of how poverty is felt in specific regions and among specific demographics. In&#13;
countries where the capacity of civic organizations is severely limited due to economic or historic&#13;
constraints, MPs may also serve as a conduit through which to ascertain specific geographic or&#13;
demographic perceptions of poverty outside of the capital city. Furthermore, technical assistance to&#13;
enhance the representative capacity of legislators provides an excellent entry point for gradual insti-&#13;

statistical data gathered by local organizations may also make poverty diagnosis more accurate.&#13;
These kinds of outreach activities may be undertaken by individual MPs hoping to ensure that their&#13;
districts are adequately affected by PRSP initiatives, but to cement parliamentary involvement in an&#13;
improved PRSP process, this engagement must become more institutionalized. Appointing a number&#13;
of MPs to the poverty diagnosis working group, or institutionalizing a plenary hearing on the&#13;
findings of the poverty diagnosis report would be one way to formalize the parliament's role in&#13;
poverty diagnosis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Parliaments and PRSP Development: Pro-Poor Policy Formulation&#13;
&#13;
Direct engagement with legislators in the policy development of the PRSP process can lead to&#13;
greater consensus on poverty reduction strategies and pave the way for smoother implementation&#13;
over time. In addition to enhancing country ownership of the PRSP through inclusion of the structure&#13;
constitutionally responsible for popular representation and relevant legislation, parliamentary&#13;
engagement also provides the PRSP with an existing body of politically active national leaders and&#13;
staff of varying skill levels and interests. Parliamentary committees may be tapped for issue specific&#13;
knowledge or experience; individual MPs may be tasked with hosting public forums to discuss&#13;
policy formation with citizens (especially poorer citizens); and parliamentary leadership could be&#13;
invited to hold public, plenary debates on a draft PRSP, thus testing the document's national&#13;
resonance prior to submission. Further, parliaments, through their committees, caucuses, staff, and&#13;
individual members have the capacity to be involved as a body in prioritization processes for the&#13;
duration of the PRSP development, and thus provide an already existing mechanism for including the&#13;
full spectrum of political actors. Although the depth of a parliament's contribution to the PRSP is&#13;
predicated on its own internal capacity, a legislature's potential to reinforce the medium- to long-&#13;
term sustainability of the PRSP make it a practical partner in the policy formulation phase. This&#13;
legislative engagement may take several forms; a few are detailed as follows.&#13;

&#13;
Public or Constituency Outreach&#13;
&#13;
                                                     As outlined in section two, MPs, as well as&#13;

      feedback outside the capital.                  poverty and its impact. In countries with&#13;
     Inviting non-urban citizens to attend           longstanding democratic traditions, MPs know&#13;
      "town hall" or village meetings to discuss     that their re-election hinges in part on popular&#13;
      poverty priorities.                            perception of them as individuals able to secure&#13;

      priorities.                                    ongoing legislative strengthening programs&#13;
     Committee hearings with NGO testimony           typically strive to reinforce or build MP&#13;
      on sector-specific issues.                     awareness that popular attitudes toward the MPs&#13;
                                                     themselves, or toward their political party, is&#13;
based on representation, service, and the passage of legislation that benefits their home district.&#13;
Where this recognition exists or is being cultivated, MPs have an interest in making sure the needs of&#13;
their voters are addressed in any national poverty reduction program. Consequently, public outreach&#13;
by MPs (as individuals, or as members of such parliamentary groups as party caucuses, issue&#13;
caucuses, or committees) may play a role in&#13;
soliciting and aggregating public input for            MP Outreach to Non-geographic Constituencies&#13;

cate with their geographic constituency on long-term policy to alleviate chronic economic problems&#13;
is one way to encourage citizens to see parliamentarians as an access point to institutional mecha-&#13;
nisms for change, rather than an individual source of funds or other benefits for personal contacts.&#13;
Moreover, a legislature that is actively involved in poverty policy issues is more likely able to serve&#13;
as a check on ruling party or government patronage. In this way, keeping parliamentarians informed&#13;
about the PRSP so that they are able to speak about it with citizens not only strengthens participatory&#13;
aspects, but encourages transparency and may serve as a first step towards curbing endemic&#13;
corruption.&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Contribution to Sector-Specific Policy Formulation&#13;
&#13;
Each country's PRSP process typically involves the establishment of working groups (or sub-&#13;
commissions) to help develop the government's poverty reduction strategies in specific sectoral&#13;
areas. The results of these working groups are then fed into the I-PRSP or full PRSP document. In&#13;
many countries, MP involvement in the PRSP has tended to be ad-hoc or based on individual interest&#13;
rather than institutional arrangement. To extend the political legitimacy of a country's PRSP and tap&#13;
into issue- or region- specific expertise that MPs may have, parliamentary involvement in PRSP&#13;
mechanisms must be more effectively institutionalized. This could include integration of MPs or&#13;
parliamentary committees into PRSP working groups, the regularization of committee briefings by&#13;
PRSP working group leaders, or the dedication of question time or interpolation to exploring PRSP&#13;
formulation and priorities.&#13;
&#13;
Integration of MPs or Parliamentary Committees into PRSP Working Groups&#13;
&#13;

Based on briefings by the working groups, committees or committee staff could determine&#13;
appropriate legislative priorities for upcoming parliamentary sessions. By keeping parliamentary&#13;
committees informed about PRSP priorities, working groups encourage a more streamlined&#13;
legislative environment for the passage of key PRSP or PRSP-support legislation. Moreover,&#13;
committee reports on national PRSP progress in light of other information available to sector-&#13;
specific committees could be the basis for a parliamentary contribution to the periodic national&#13;
progress report required by IFI's.&#13;

3.3 Parliamentary Review of the Draft PRSP Document&#13;
&#13;
Filling Gaps in the Participatory Process&#13;
&#13;
Although countries are expected to consult with all national stakeholders in the development of a&#13;
PRSP, where parliamentarians believe that a particular actor or group of actors has not been&#13;
adequately consulted, they may be able to facilitate inclusion of inadvertently excluded stakeholders.&#13;
While capacity constraints may prevent many national legislatures from serving as the primary point&#13;
of participatory integration (ie: a legislature with full technical capacity could be relied upon to&#13;
conduct a large number of public hearings to investigate policy options or outcomes), parliaments&#13;
could incrementally expand their role in the consultative process. Gradually expanding activities&#13;
could include public committee hearings, the commissioning of a specific investigation, or tabling of&#13;
a report to reflect input from civic&#13;
actors. By providing an opportunity                         Committees and Caucuses May Provide&#13;

PRSP's participatory process, such            parliamentary review of any aspect of PRSP development or&#13;
activities could encourage greater            implementation could assist national or external assessment by&#13;
PRSP support from groups with the             providing an additional source of information. Consequently, if&#13;
potential to disrupt implementation           parliaments plan to share the findings of their investigation&#13;
(parties currently in opposition but          with IFI staff in country, this information may be of most use&#13;
with the potential return to power in         prior to the completion of the JSA. Similarly, Ministries may&#13;

strategies. By including multiple political parties, an opportunity for time-limited parliamentary&#13;
debate on he PRSP prior to its submission could also strengthen the country's ability to adhere to a&#13;
poverty reduction strategy over time. Finally, even where parliamentary debate regarding the PRSP&#13;
leads to no formal resolution or motion, it would likely foster public awareness and debate about&#13;
various aspects of the PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
     4. Recognizing a Role for Parliaments in PRSP Implementation&#13;
              Budget Allocation, Legislation, and Public Education&#13;
&#13;
Because parliaments are ultimately responsible for passing sound legislation, the national assembly's&#13;
ability to improve PRSP implementation is primarily rooted in aligning national legislation with&#13;
PRSP priorities; in order for countries to implement their poverty reduction strategies, legislatures&#13;
must approve PRSP-compatible budgets and pass PRSP-relevant legislation. Consequently, a&#13;
parliament's ability to evaluate proposed legislation with an eye to PRSP priorities takes on added&#13;
importance in relation to ensuring a results-oriented, comprehensive implementation of the strategy.&#13;
&#13;
4.1 Budget Allocations&#13;
                                                Figure 2. Parliamentary Involvement in Budget and PRSP Cycles&#13;

content of the PRSP prior to its submission as part of the budget approval process. At the same time,&#13;
steps must be taken to ensure that parliamentary committees have adequate staffing and technical&#13;
capacities to engage closely with the more technical aspects of PRSP-specific budget analysis.&#13;
&#13;
4.2 Legislation&#13;
&#13;
In many cases, non-budgetary legislation may be required to implement a full PRSP; thus, PRSP-&#13;
specific assessment of legislation can (and should) occur at multiple levels.&#13;

&#13;
Managing Legislation and Legislative Impact Across Sectors&#13;
&#13;
Secondary legislation will often be needed in order to implement different parts of the PRSP. For&#13;
example, a country might identify education as one of its sector priorities, with their PRSP indicating&#13;
that the budget will allocate a series of block grants to local councils to be applied to education needs&#13;
as determined by the local council. If however, decentralization of decision making authority and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                               Parliaments and the PRSP Process    13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
financial responsibility for education has not yet occurred, legislation decentralizing these powers is&#13;
necessary before the PRSP can be fully implemented. In addition to decentralization laws,&#13;
parliaments may be required to address labor laws, tax codes, equal rights legislation, or trade&#13;
policies to proceed with PRSP plans. A parliament that has already played an active role in the&#13;
diagnosis and development of its PRSP will be better able to coordinate the passage of such&#13;
legislation.&#13;
&#13;
4.3 Educating the Public on PRSP Processes, Programs, and Impact&#13;

        5. Aligning Parliamentary Oversight Mechanisms with PRSP&#13;
                                 Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
Because the PRSP process is cyclical, several of the&#13;
mechanisms for parliamentary strengthening of the                    Parliamentary Oversight and PRSP&#13;
PRSP during monitoring and evaluation phases are             While effective PRSPs include a plan for ongo-&#13;
quite similar to those applied during poverty                ing monitoring and evaluation, certain parlia-&#13;
diagnosis and PRSP formulation. Information                  mentary practices may be leveraged to&#13;
gleaned in this phase about the impact and                   strengthen in-country monitoring or evaluation&#13;
performance of PRSP initiatives will eventually              capacity.&#13;
become the basis upon which countries adjust                    Parliamentary review or confirmation of key&#13;
poverty reduction strategies, shift resources, or                officials (commissions)&#13;
determine whether priority targets have been met.               Executive updates before committees (can&#13;
Parliaments, already constitutionally charged with               be facilitated through inclusion of reporting&#13;
providing oversight for executive branch                         requirements in PRSP text)&#13;
implementation of legislation and budget policies,              Queries about PRSP initiatives or results&#13;
can be a natural clearinghouse for information on                during regular `question time'&#13;
assessment of PRSP implementation from a variety                Public requests for information from&#13;
of sources. Parliamentary oversight activities may               ministries or other executive bodies&#13;
also strengthen a country's capacity for self                   Committee request for findings of external&#13;
assessment of PRSP implementation by requesting                  auditing bodies&#13;
evidence that the executive is pursuing activities in           Commissioned investigations into lack of&#13;
                                                                 adherence to PRSP priorities&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                Parliaments and the PRSP Process   15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
keeping with PRSP priorities, or by posing sector-specific questions on the effectiveness of&#13;
particular strategies or activities.&#13;
&#13;
5.1 Committee Hearings on the Impact of PRSP Initiatives&#13;
&#13;
Although statistical data on the impacts of PRSP initiatives is critical to assessing the&#13;
implementation of a country's poverty reduction strategy, non-quantitative elements play a key role&#13;
in evaluating the program's impact on quality of life for the poor. As in the poverty diagnosis phase&#13;
of the PRSP process, one way for parliament to compliment ongoing efforts to gather information&#13;
and monitor changes in the non-quantitative dimensions of poverty would be to solicit input from&#13;
geographically or demographically specific areas through MPs' constituency outreach activities. As&#13;
before, sector specific committees could ask MPs to solicit information on the impact of PRSP&#13;
driven programs through office hours, casework, town hall meetings, surveys, or informal focus&#13;
groups already being conducted, or could look to bring sector-relevant NGOs to testify before&#13;
committees on the results of PRSP priority projects. Bringing citizens' feedback directly into&#13;
parliamentary debates on the results of the year's PRSP implementation not only makes the whole&#13;
process more participatory, but also creates sufficient transparency to allow international partners&#13;
more insight into the soundness of the PRSP as it is being implemented. Further, by setting a&#13;
precedent for legislative investigation into the policy implementation by the executive branch, this&#13;
complementary activity helps to build a check and balance system for more sustainable anti-poverty&#13;
initiatives over time.&#13;

5.2 Legislative Review of Annual PRSP Progress Reports&#13;
&#13;
It is expected that an annual progress report will be prepared by countries that are implementing a&#13;
full PRSP. A parliament engaged in even a single phase of the PRSP process ­ whether that is de-&#13;
                                                   termining the non-quantitative aspects of poverty,&#13;

      PRSP commission                              oversight and project evaluation ­ would be able to&#13;
     Sector-specific committee hearings on         review annual PRSP reports. In addition to again&#13;
      sectoral PRSP initiatives culminating in     lending greater participation through its&#13;
      pre-report recommendations                   representative nature, it is in these annual reports&#13;
     Plenary review and resolution in support      that adjustments to PRSP priorities or programs are&#13;
      of annual progress report                    made, thus parliamentary review provides an addi-&#13;
     Sub-parliamentary groups to gather civic      tional check on whether pending legislation and&#13;
      input regarding specific sectors             budget allocations are in line with current PRSP&#13;
                                                   priorities. Some thought might also be given to the&#13;
implementation of a system of pre-report recommendations made by committees to the relevant min-&#13;
istries or working groups.&#13;
&#13;
5. 3 Integrating Parliamentarians or Parliamentary Committees into Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation Groups&#13;
&#13;
As part of the PRSP process, PRSP countries may create Public Expenditure Management (PEM)&#13;
groups or other groups to monitor performance. As with working groups during policy formulation,&#13;
parliamentary interaction with evaluation groups would improve the sustainability of the PRSP&#13;
process by lending the parliament's broader political legitimacy to groups otherwise appointed by the&#13;
executive branch. Here, institutionalized parliamentary interaction with monitoring could take one of&#13;
two forms: assign a pre-determined number of MPs serving on relevant sectoral committees to&#13;
participate as observers in monitoring groups, or, establish a regular schedule on which evaluation&#13;
teams brief relevant committees on their findings. Barring unusual constitutional or other political&#13;
circumstances, the most efficient way of combining PRSP monitoring with parliamentary oversight&#13;
responsibilities would be through an institutionalized schedule of briefings. This practice would also&#13;
encourage transparency of general budget expenditure, again reinforcing domestic checks on&#13;
patronage systems.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                         Parliaments and the PRSP Process      17&#13;

globally, parliamentary networks6 offer a means for deputies to survey and discuss universal chal-&#13;

tries begin to implement and evaluate their own PRSP initiatives, the value of these cross-country&#13;
exchanges will grow.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The PRSP (Poverty Reduction Strategy
            Paper) process is continually evolving as countries and
            their development partners learn from early experience. This
            report is designed to assist those involved in poverty
            reduction strategies with identifying and implementing
            activities and programs that will integrate existing
            democratic institutions, namely the national assembly or
            parliament, into poverty reduction efforts, thus
            strengthening the impact and sustainability of each
            country's PRSP. Through analysis, checklists, and
            activity options, the report highlights specific mechanisms
            by which parliaments can strengthen the PRSP process and
            reinforce its positive outcomes though greater involvement
            in poverty diagnosis, policy development, PRSP
            implementation, and evaluation/monitoring. For ease of use,
            it has been organized in keeping with the PRSP cycle.
            Consequently, sections two, three, four, and five address
            opportunities for legislative involvement in poverty
            diagnosis, policy formulation, implementation, and
            monitoring and evaluation, respectively.
