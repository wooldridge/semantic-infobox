BOLIVIA&#13;
ENVIRONMENT, INDUSTRY AND MINING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    In Bolivia, non-agnrcultural economic activity has been concentrated in mining, petroleum&#13;
extraction, agricultural and forestry industries, textiles and light manufacturing. These activities, which&#13;
will likely underpin the country's economic development in the medium-term, have grown with little&#13;
concem for environmental protection or worker health and safety. In the case of mining, Bolivia has&#13;
been a commercial producer (mainly silver, tin) since the sixteenth century. Since the 1950s, a&#13;
significant share of the industry has been operated by COMIBOL, the State-owned mining company&#13;
In response to the need for capital and management improvements, COMIBOL is withdrawing from&#13;
production operations, and will remain as a contract administrator. It has reduced its operations. and&#13;
has begun to offer its economically-viable mines and smelters for private participation.  Some&#13;
properties have been closed, others are being leased or offered for outright sale, or in the case of the&#13;
Vinto smelter, for inclusion in the Government's Capitalization Program. The latter Program is&#13;
designed to attract private investment into key State-owned enterprises, and to distribute Government-&#13;
owned shares to privately-managed pension funds for the benefit of the Bolivian population. IDA is&#13;
supporting mining sector restructuring under the ongoing Mining Sector Rehabilitation Project, and the&#13;
wider Capitalization Program through the Capitalization Program Adjustment Credit. The mining&#13;
sector restructuring aims at establishing an enabling environment for private development of the sector,&#13;
based on the reform and modernization of the legal and institutional framework. In the case of&#13;
industry, apart from three cement plants, manufacturing is relatively underdeveloped, though medium&#13;
and smaller-scale operations exist near major cities. Principal activities center on textiles, leather&#13;
products, food and beverage products and wood processing.&#13;
A.    Environmental Pollution from Industry&#13;
2.    In the case of industry, pollution originates mainly from the discharge of untreated effluents to&#13;
rivers or inadequate municipal sewage systems. Instances of localized air pollution also arise in mining&#13;
and industry, e.g. from smelters, refineries, or cement plants.&#13;
B.    Environmental Conditions in Mining Communities&#13;
3.    In the COMIBOL mining centers that would be covered by the Project -- namely Oruro (San&#13;
Jose mine), Potosi (IJnificada mine), Llallagua (Siglo XX mine and Catavi smelter), Santa Fe, Huanuni,&#13;
Colquiri, and Caracoles, and others -- past and ongoing mining activities have created numerous&#13;
sources of contamination which affect surface water (and in some cases, groundwater), air, and soil.&#13;
Tailings from the mills, waste rock, underground and open-pit mine workings, roads, wastewater&#13;
ponds, landfills, and smelters are among the potential existing sources of mining-related pollution Of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
particular concern are those sources which generate very low-pH water (acid rock drainage or ARD),&#13;
which dissolves and transports metals, such as lead, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc, which may pose a&#13;
threat to human health and the environment. Acid rock drainage discharges from mine entryways&#13;
(adits), and seeps from the tailings and rock piles. The nature, extent, and impact of ARD varies&#13;
greatly, however. The environmental degradation associated with ARD is determined by many factors,&#13;
including water chemistry in receiving streams and rivers, dilution and temperature.&#13;
4.    In addition, mine waste has been used extensively in mining communities to build&#13;
impoundments, roads, and common areas such as playgrounds and sports fields. Many of these&#13;
structures continue to release metals through the acid-generating process. Inhabitants of the mining&#13;
communities frequently come into direct contact with the mine waste; children play on or adjacent to&#13;
tailings and waste rock piles, and people build houses directly on old tailings. However it is important&#13;
to note that contact -- even direct contact -- does not presuppose risk. Mine waste is highly variable,&#13;
both in toxicity and in bioavailability. For example, some forms of arsenic or of lead are not readily&#13;
absorbed into the human body, and therefore do not pose a significant risk to human health.&#13;
5.    The environment in mining towns is also polluted by the contaminants typical of poor&#13;
communities in many developing countries. For example, drinking water is frequently contaminated&#13;
with bacteria and fecal coliform, and ambient air is contaminated with dust from industrial and&#13;
combustion sources, lead from smelters and vehicle exhaust, and sulfur dioxide from smelters. In many&#13;
mining communities, these pollutants may be causing more damage to human health than heavy metal&#13;
pollution from mining.&#13;
6.    In the context of restructuring the mining sector, COMIBOL is commissioning environmental&#13;
audits for a priority set of fourteen mining properties. The first three audits, respectively for Oruro&#13;
(San Jose mine), Huanuni, and Colquiri have been completed; the rest are expected to be completed by&#13;
December 1995. In addition, the ongoing Oruro Pilot Project being carried out through the Secretariat&#13;
of Mines is conducting an environmental assessment of an important mining region of Bolivia which&#13;
contains several COMIBOL properties. Together, these studies will identify major environmental&#13;
problems at various sites, provide data to inform the assignment of environmental liabilities between&#13;
parties to divestment transactions, and define cost-effective, site-specific, remediation plans. The&#13;
recommendations for remediation emanating from the environmental audits for San Jose, Huanuni and&#13;
Colquiri are summarized in Annex 8, and in the Project File.&#13;
C.    Institutional Framework for Environmental Management&#13;
7.    Due to growing environmental concern, in 1991/92 the (then) Government established the&#13;
National Secretariat for the Environment (SENMA) with IDA support. It also issued a National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan and passed an umbrella Environmental Law. The present Government has&#13;
indicated its commitment to environmental management by establishing a Ministry of Sustainable&#13;
Development and Environment (MSDE). The MSDE -- which absorbed SENMA and the Planning&#13;
Ministry -- is charged with formulating and implementing national policies to encourage development&#13;
with concem for the environment. Presently, MSDE, through its Subsecretariat of Environment,&#13;
(which is responsible for EIA and enforcement activities), is promulgating initial national environmental&#13;
Regulations covering EIA, air, water, and solid and hazardous wastes. However, the staff of MSDE is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
still small and has limited practical experience. Moreover, the baseline information, laboratory capacity,&#13;
and environmental management policies and concrete action plans based on a sound assessment of&#13;
environmental priorities at the national and regional levels all remain to be refined. IDA, IDB and&#13;
bilateral donors are supporting MSDE's programs, which now need to be made tangible inter alia&#13;
through institutional strengthening of MSDE and line agencies; development of baseline data and&#13;
procedures to support EA and compliance monitoring of greenfield and ongoing operations;&#13;
implementation, and ultimately refinement, of sectoral environmental regulations, standards, and codes&#13;
of practice; strengthening of environmental testing laboratories, (so that locally-conducted analyses&#13;
have credibility in Bolivia and abroad, and are able to support a national environmental monitoring&#13;
system); and improvement of the Government's capacity to communicate to stakeholders concerning&#13;
risks to health and the environment due to pollution. Moreover, both the Government and the private&#13;
sector need assistance to identify and make cost-effective firm-level investments to abate pollution from&#13;
sources for which they are liable under the emerging regulatory regime. The IDB has approved a&#13;
project for MSDE aimed at strengthening its management systems and staffing, especially outside La&#13;
Paz.&#13;
IL THlE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Objectives&#13;
8.     The Project would: (i) support the implementation and refinement of a regulatory framework&#13;
to assure that privately-led mining and industrial activities grow in a more environmentally-friendly&#13;
fashion; (ii) help remediate contamination from past mining activities for which the State accepts&#13;
liability, including remediation activities that help facilitate private investment in the mining sector; and&#13;
(iii) assist in attracting non-Project resources (e.g. from the FIS, FNDR, or FDC') for investments&#13;
which are not eligible for financing under the Project in mining communities, in order to address urgent&#13;
environmental problems, e.g. for potable water and sanitation.&#13;
B.    Project Description&#13;
9.     The Project has been designed based upon the findings of a 1993 sectoral environmental&#13;
assessment for the mining and industrial sectors, as well as a number of studies carried out during&#13;
Project preparation (e.g. on the adequacy of laboratory testing services; on the treatment of&#13;
environmental liabilities in the privatization process; and on the development of risk-based selection&#13;
criteria for publicly-funded remediation investments in mining).   The Project would include&#13;
components as follows:&#13;
I Bolivia has established, inter alia with IDA financing, a number of programs to assist municipalities and rural&#13;
areas address their most serious environmental problems -- contaminated drinking water and dust containing lead,&#13;
arsenic, cadmium, and zinc -- by providing basic infrastructure. These programs fund activities such as water&#13;
sanitation systems and road paving.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1.    Studies to Support the Development of the Regulatory Framework&#13;
10    The Project would finance two studies aimed at improving environmental management, both at&#13;
the national level as well as in the important regions of Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and El Alto (La Paz).&#13;
The studies would be contracted by MSDE and would include two types of tasks. First, tasks aimed&#13;
at basic data collection would: (i) collect and analyze data to identify the mines and industries with&#13;
significant environmental impacts; (ii) collect and analyze baseline ambient water quality data for&#13;
selected surface and subterranean water bodies; and (iii) evaluate the potential costs and benefits of&#13;
pollution prevention measures in firms in the leather-tanning, meat, and brick-making industries, sugar&#13;
refineries and distilleries, and cement plants. Second, tasks aimed at policy developnment and&#13;
implementation would&#13;
(i)    assist MSDE and MED, in conjunction with the mining and industrial sectors, to&#13;
develop and implement (through training) improved policies and procedures for&#13;
environmental assessment for investments in the respective sectors,&#13;
(ii)    design a system of incentives to encourage adoption of improved environmental&#13;
practices at the firm level;&#13;
{iii)    develop and help implement a mechanism for financing remediation of contamination&#13;
from past mining activities on a long term-basis;&#13;
(iv)   identify sources of hazardous waste, characterize hazardous wastes, and design and&#13;
help implement a regulatory framework to manage them,&#13;
(v)    review and update ambient quality standards and discharge standards for the industrial&#13;
and mining sectors;&#13;
(1Yij) develop and help implement a national strategy for environmental monitoring and&#13;
enforcementt; and&#13;
(vii)   develop and help implement a national strategy to communicate to the public risks to&#13;
health and the environment from pollution, based on the best scientific knowledge.&#13;
i H.   One important output from the various studies would be a set of agreed action plans for Santa&#13;
Cnrz, Cochabamba and El Alto, which could form the basis for future environmental improvement&#13;
projects in each region. The studies would be sequenced so as to build upon each other, using data&#13;
from one study as input into another, wherever feasible. Studies would include training components&#13;
fo, local staff, to maximize technology transfer. Draft Terms of Reference for the two proposed&#13;
studies are included in the Project File. These programs are estimated to cost US$4.0n million (18% of&#13;
total Project costs). Costs are based upon professional judgments regarding required manpower input&#13;
and uait costs, and the cost of similar studies in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
2.    Laboratory Upgrading&#13;
12.   The Project would implement a program to foster development of credible laboratory testing&#13;
services in Bolivia by: (i) clarifying and strengthening the policy and institutional framework to support&#13;
diffusion of improved operating standards and accreditation of labs operating throughout the country,&#13;
and (ii) supporting the development of three key institutions to serve as lead agencies in the lab&#13;
upgrading process, namely Instituto de Investigaciones Geol6gicas (IG) and the Instituto de Ecologia&#13;
(IE) at the Universidad Mayor de San Andres, and Instituto Boliviano de Normalizaci(in y Calidad&#13;
(IBNORCA). As a first step, at Project inception MSDE would contract two technical assistance&#13;
activities, respectively to: (i) conduct an inventory of laboratories in Bolivia, to assess the local capacity&#13;
to provide environmental testing services, and prepare forecasts of the regional demand for various&#13;
analytical services for environmental monitoring; and (ii) design and reach consensus upon the policy&#13;
and institutional framework for a national standardization and quality system, which is essential for the&#13;
widespread accreditation of labs. FoUlowing completion of these initial activities, the Project would&#13;
support a range of self-improvement programs, acceptable to IDA, to be proposed by 1G, [E,&#13;
IBNORCA, or MSDE, through the Environmental Coordinating Unit (ECU) (para. 25). Activities to&#13;
be supported would include:&#13;
(i)    consulting services, study tours, and short training courses sponsored by MSDE&#13;
and/or IBNORCA to implement the policy and institutional framework within&#13;
which credible laboratory-based environmental testing services could develop,&#13;
(ii)    participation in proficiency testing programs with reputed laboratories to enable&#13;
IG and IE to determine the relative level of their capabilities;&#13;
(iii)   studies to assist in achieving international accreditation of IG and/or IE,&#13;
(iv)    preparation of market surveys, feasibility studies, business plans, and related&#13;
facility improvement programs for IG, IE, or IBNORCA;&#13;
(v)    training activities sponsored by IG, IE, IBNORCA, or MSDE to improve the&#13;
quality of laboratory operations or field sampling methods in Bolivia. Preference&#13;
would be given to training offered for personnel from more than one institution,&#13;
to encourage inter-institutional collaboration and efficient use of resources,&#13;
(vi)   capital improvement programs for IG, IE, or IBNORCA, including services,&#13;
goods and civil works. Such programs would need to be justified on the basis of&#13;
feasibility studies and sound business plans, and be linked to the improvement of&#13;
environmental testing services in Bolivia, and&#13;
(vii)   activities sponsored by MSDE, IE, IG, or IBNORCA to develop a professional&#13;
association of laboratories in Bolivia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
13.   The program is estimated to cost US$2.0 million (9% of total Project costs). Costs are based&#13;
upon professional judgments regarding manpower inputs, unit costs, and the likely absorptive capacity&#13;
of related institutions during the Project period.&#13;
3.    Remediation Investments&#13;
14.   A list of mine sites to be considered as possible candidates for environmental improvement&#13;
interventions has been prepared on the basis of risk-based eligibility criteria tailored to the mining&#13;
sector (Annex 8 and Project File). These criteria included, inter alia, the impact that mining pollution&#13;
would reasonably have on human health, economic activities or ecosystems for each site. For each of&#13;
these sites, environmental audits would provide information to identify a range of environmental&#13;
management measures (e.g. potable water, sanitation, urban paving for dust control, remediation of&#13;
mine tailing piles, control of the flow of acid mine drainage etc.) which show promise of yielding the&#13;
highest benefits for the resources used, if carried out in the specific locale (Annex 8 and Project File).&#13;
The highest yielding -- and therefore priority -- measures may or may not, in any specific mining&#13;
community, include remediation of contamination from past mining activities. The Project would&#13;
finance, on a pilot basis, only those eligible subprojects comprising priority environmental&#13;
management measures which (i) had their origin in mining activities; (ii) were the responsibility of the&#13;
State under Bolivia's environmental liability provisions; and (iii) could not be addressed with financing&#13;
through established municipal and rural improvement programs, such as the FIS, FNDR, or FDC. The&#13;
Project would assist communities in accessing non-Project sources of funding for priority investments&#13;
which did not satisfy the above-mentioned eligibility criteria by financing consultants (promotores) who&#13;
would be employed by the Secretariat of Mines. These consultants would work with the mining&#13;
communities to identify and prepare projects for funding from various non-Project financing sources.&#13;
Project activities would not therefore duplicate ongoing municipal improvement initiatives, nor violate&#13;
the established investment planning process at the municipal level.&#13;
15.   An initial set of environmental management measures which demonstrate primafacie promise&#13;
of yielding adequate economic returns, has been agreed with MSDE and MED to be considered for the&#13;
San Jose, Huanuni and Colquiri mines, and is included in Annex 8 and the Project File. Detailed plans&#13;
for the remediation activities, and associated cost-benefit studies would be prepared for each eligible&#13;
subproject, and those investments with acceptable economic returns would be proposed to IDA for&#13;
financing under the Project. In addition, the Project would finance remediation activities that remove&#13;
impediments to private investment in COMIBOL mines in those cases where legal remedies would be&#13;
insufficient to aUleviate concerns of private investors about liability for past contamination, and cleanup&#13;
by COMIBOL would be demonstrably cost-effective. The methodology for carrying out cost-&#13;
benefit studies, and associated investment decision criteria, would be included in an Operational&#13;
Manual to be adopted under the Project as a condition of Effectiveness (para. 27).&#13;
16.   The initial set (Annex 8) of eligible subprojects for possible financing under the Project for San&#13;
Jose in Oruro consists of selective tailings remediation, channeling and treatment of acid mine drainage,&#13;
and remediation of physical threats in old mine operations. In Huanuni and Colquiri, audits have&#13;
also identified environmental improvements likely to be justifiable at those sites. However, the final&#13;
designation of activities for possible financing under the Project would only be made once negotiations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
with private investors have been concluded. In other sites, investments would be identified as more&#13;
information becomes available.&#13;
17.   As many eligible subprojects as can be supported within the available financing would be&#13;
considered for the Project. The program is estimated to cost US$6.0 million (27% of total Project&#13;
costs).&#13;
4.    Technical Assistance and Training to Support Environmental Management&#13;
in Mining&#13;
18.   The Project would include financing for consulting services, equipment and training to assist&#13;
the Secretariat of Mining to improve environmental management in the mining sector, and COMIBOL&#13;
to benefit from technical studies related to preparation of eligible subprojects (para. 14), as well as to&#13;
inform its broader environmental management efforts in its various mines. The activities to be&#13;
supported under the Project would complement those environmentally-related activities being&#13;
supported under the MSRP, and would include:&#13;
(i)    development of procedures for mine permitting, inspection, enforcement&#13;
reclamation and closure, including methods of financial assurance;&#13;
(ii)    development and dissemination of Codes of Practice to enable mine operators to&#13;
comply with emergent environmental regulations;&#13;
(iii)   assistance to develop environmental monitoring programs to collect data on&#13;
ambient air, water, and soil conditions, and on human health impacts at various&#13;
COMIBOL mine sites;&#13;
(iv)    basic hydrological studies for various COMIBOL mine sites, inter alia to enable&#13;
COMIBOL to prepare mitigation plans for properties to be transferred to the&#13;
private sector, or closed. Hydrological data would also be used to complement&#13;
data sets on geology and geochemistry which are being developed in conjunction&#13;
with a pilot Geographic Information System (GIS) under the ongoing MSRP, and&#13;
would thereby further the capacity of the GIS to inform site-specific&#13;
environmental risk assessment in the mining sector. This would open up&#13;
possibilities for more efficient environmental regulation of mining operations; and&#13;
(v)    engineering designs for remediation interventions at COMIBOL mines.&#13;
The program is estimated to cost US$4.5 million (20% of total Project costs).&#13;
C.    Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
19.   The Project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board&#13;
on February 8, 1994. The Bank Group strategy reflected in the CAS focuses on eliminating the&#13;
remaining structural constraints to growth and expanding the availability of resources for poverty and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
human capital development within a sustainable environment. The lending program included in the&#13;
CAS contemplates projects falling within three categories: (i) rationalizing the role of the State,&#13;
(ii) poverty and human resource development; and (iii) environment and natural resource management.&#13;
The proposed Project includes programs germane to two of the previously-mentioned categories,&#13;
namely assisting the Government to meet its environmental liabilities arising from privatization, and&#13;
fostering private development of the mining and industrial sectors in a more environmentally-friendly&#13;
fashion. IDA's ongoing cross-sectoral involvement in industrial, mining, and environmental issues in&#13;
Bolivia piaces it in a unique position to mobilize efforts to address the complex issues involved with&#13;
pollution abatement there.&#13;
D.    Program Objective Categories&#13;
20.   The Project would contribute to IDA's environrnent, and private and public sector reform&#13;
categones.&#13;
E.    Environmental Aspects&#13;
21.   The Project is classified as a "B" project, owing to its focus on environmental improvement.&#13;
Its design is based on a sectoral environmental assessment (EA) for the mining and industrial sectors,&#13;
which was financed by the Government of Sweden and prepared in 1992/93 in consultation with over&#13;
forty organizations, including major NGOs. Major findings of the EA were that: (i) there were&#13;
significant problems with water pollution; (ii) forthcoming steps to "privatize" COMIBOL's rmines&#13;
provided an important opportunity to improve environmental management in mining; and (iii)&#13;
programs should be encouraged to improve knowledge of environmental conditions, strengthen&#13;
environmental management, and develop consensual approaches for compliance.&#13;
F.    Project Costs and Financing&#13;
22.   Total Project costs are estimated at US$22.0 mniHion equivalent, as shown in Annex 1, which&#13;
also includes a financing plan2. Contingencies include price contingencies, which have been calculated&#13;
by applying IDA's projected US dollar average inflation rate of 2.2% per annum for each year in the&#13;
project period to the base costs for studies and the laboratory upgrading component and Project&#13;
adrministration. The same inflation factor has been applied to local and foreign cost items because it is&#13;
assumed that any differential between local and foreign inflation rates will be offset by exchange rate&#13;
adjustments. The proposed IDA credit of SDR 7.4 million (US$1 1.0 million equivalent) plus the&#13;
expected SDR 5 0 million (US$7.5 million equivalent) in expected cofinancing from the Nordic&#13;
Development Fund (NDF) would cover 84% of total estimated Project costs; the Government would&#13;
provide the balance. The proposed cost-sharing arrangement is within the standard IDA cost-sharing&#13;
ratio for Bolivia (85%). Retroactive financing for up to SDR 400,000 (approximately US$600,000&#13;
equivalent) wvould be provided to finance Project start-up costs incurred after October 31, 1995, and&#13;
initially covered by bridge financing provided by the Government. In order to make optimal use of&#13;
NDF and IDA resources, while respecting their respective procurement requirements, NDF resources&#13;
2 Estimates of Bolivian taxes (e.g. on consulting services) are shown as an explicit line item, since they will need&#13;
to be budgeted for counterpart funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
would be concentrated on financing consultants' services for the Secretariat of Mines and MSDE&#13;
(Annex 5B). The proposed IDA credit would be made on standard IDA terms, with a 40 year&#13;
repayment period. The terms of the proposed NDF cofinancing would be similar to those for IDA. It&#13;
is expected that the IDA credit and foreign cofinancing would be frilly committed within four years&#13;
following effectiveness.&#13;
G.    Project Implementation&#13;
1.    Project Organization and Management&#13;
23.   The Borrower would be the Republic of Bolivia, represented by the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
Appropriate internal agreements would delegate to MSDE the responsibility for implementing the&#13;
regulatory studies and the laboratory upgrading component. Similarly, the Secretariat of Mines in&#13;
MED would be delegated responsibility for implementing studies, training, and investment programs&#13;
related to remediation activities in the mining sector, including those activities for which COMIBOL&#13;
would be the direct beneficiary. MED would carry out technical assistance activities and eligible&#13;
subprojects on COMIBOL's behalf under the terms of an agreement between MED and COMNIBOL.&#13;
MSDE would carry out laboratory upgrading programs on beneficiaries' (IG, IE or IBNORCA) behalf&#13;
on the basis of agreements between MSDE and the respective institutions. The Central Bank would be&#13;
designated to maintairn the Special Accounts (para. 3 8).&#13;
24.   MSDE  would implement its components of the Project through an Environmental&#13;
Coordinating Unit (ECU) located in the Subsecretariat of Environment, and headed by an&#13;
Environmental Project Coordinator (EPC). The EPC and key staff to be financed in whole or in part&#13;
by foreign resources under the Project would have qualifications, experience and terms of employment&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The ECU would have sufficient budgetary and decision-making authority to carry&#13;
out its mission, and would have staff adequately trained inter alia in the procurement, financial&#13;
management, and reporting requirements of the Bolivian public sector as well as IDA and NDF. The&#13;
ECU's staff would be complemented by at least one filil-time expert with broad experience in managing&#13;
environmental management studies. The EPC would have access to resources to hire additional&#13;
expertise as required. During the implementation of MSDE's programs, the EPC would involve the&#13;
staff of relevant line units in MSDE as local counterpart staff e.g. for the two studies to develop the&#13;
regulatory framework (para. 10). In this way, knowledge gained through the Project would be&#13;
'hiainstreamed"within MSDE.&#13;
25.   The ECU would inter alia: (i) procure the regulatory framework studies, as well as consulting&#13;
services, equipment, civil works, and training activities on behalf of beneficiaries under the laboratory&#13;
upgrading component; (ii) communicate with IDA and NDF concerning Project activities assigned to&#13;
MSDE, and ensure that IDA and NDF (as relevant) procurement, disbursement, auditing, and&#13;
reporting requirements would be satisfied for the activities supported by the respective financing&#13;
agencies. It would also share with IDA environmental monitoring information on the impact of&#13;
Project-financed remediation investments in the mining sector which MSDE (or the relevant authority)&#13;
would have access to in its role as the environmental monitoring authority under Bolivian law; (iii)&#13;
submit Withdrawal Applications to MSDE's Special Account (para. 38), IDA or NDF (as appropriate)&#13;
for expenditures related to the studies, laboratory upgrading, and project coordination which the ECUJ&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
would be directly responsible for incurring; (iv) collaborate with IDA and NDF to conduct periodic&#13;
Project supervision missions, as well as annual and mid-term reviews of progress with MSDE's&#13;
programs under the Project, and to prepare an Operational Plan and Implementation Completion&#13;
Report within six months following Project completion (para. 45); and (v) forward to IDA on behalf of&#13;
the Central Bank monthly reports of transactions in MSDE's Special Account, including its balance&#13;
(para. 46). Beneficiaries under the laboratory upgrading component would prepare proposals for&#13;
assistance to address their most pressing development needs, for consideration by the EPC and IDA&#13;
within the criteria established under the Project (para. 12). They would therefore be expected to&#13;
assume a proactive role in devising their programs for inclusion under the Project. In order to obtain&#13;
the commitment of stakeholders in studies (e.g. for pollution prevention) requiring active participation&#13;
from private firms, ECU would refine the objectives and scope of work for the studies in consultation&#13;
with relevant national Secretariats and national and regional industry associations, and would carry out&#13;
enterprise-level diagnostic work through independent consultants selected in consultation with such&#13;
associations. Such consultants would apply adequate safeguards to respect the confidentiality of&#13;
proprietary information.&#13;
26.   The Secretariat of Mines would implement its programs through a Sectoral Coordinating Unit&#13;
(SCU), headed by a Sectoral Project Coordinator (SPC), which would procure all consulting services,&#13;
goods and works financed through MED under the Project. This would include all activities for which&#13;
COMIBOL would be direct beneficiary. The SPC and key local and foreign staff to be financed in&#13;
whole or in part by foreign resources under the Project would have qualifications, experience and terms&#13;
of employment acceptable to IDA. The SCU would have sufficient budgetary and decision-making&#13;
authority to carry out its mission effectively, and would have staff adequately trained inter alia in the&#13;
procurement, financial management, and reporting requirements of the Bolivian public sector as well as&#13;
IDA and NDF. The staff of the SCU would be complemented by at least one expert with broad&#13;
experience in supervising the design and execution of remediation works in the mining sector. During&#13;
the implementation of MED's programs, the SPC would involve relevant line staff from the Secretariat&#13;
of Mines and COMIBOL as local counterpart staff e.g. in the carrying out of various studies. In this&#13;
way, knowledge gained through the Project would be 'hiainstreamed" within the key local mining&#13;
sector agencies. The SCU would inter alia: (i) forward to IDA proposals for remediation subprojects&#13;
in the mining sector, once it had deterrmined that such proposals were complete (para. 28); (ii)&#13;
communicate with IDA and NDF concerning Project activities assigned to the Secretariat of Mines,&#13;
and ensure that IDA and NDF (as relevant) procurement, disbursement, auditing, and reporting&#13;
requirements would be satisfied for such activities; and (iii) submit Withdrawal Applications to the&#13;
MED's Special Account (para. 38), IDA or NDF, as appropriate, for expenditures related to Project&#13;
components which it was responsible for executing; (iv) collaborate with IDA and NDF to conduct&#13;
periodic Project supervision missions, as well as annual and mid-term reviews of progress with its&#13;
Secretariat's programs under the Project, and to prepare an Operational Plan and Implementation&#13;
Completion Report within six months following Project completion (para. 45); and (v) forward to IDA&#13;
on behalf of the Central Bank monthly statements of transactions under the Special Account for MED,&#13;
including its balance (para. 46).&#13;
27.   Prior to credit effectiveness, the Borrower would adopt an Operational Manual, satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, containing: (i) drafts of contractual arrangements between the Ministry of Finance and MSDE&#13;
and MED; MSDE and the beneficiaries under the laboratory component; and the Secretariat of Mines&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
and COMIBOL; (ii) eligibility criteria for selecting remediation investments in the mining sector; (iii)&#13;
terms of reference for the two regulatory studies to be carried out by MSDE, and the technical&#13;
assistance programs, respectively, to inventory labs and assess demand for environmental testing&#13;
services, and to design the policy and institutional framework for a national standardization and quality&#13;
system; (iv) terms of reference for financial audits of Project accounts; and (v) agreed Project&#13;
monitoring indicators.&#13;
28.   COMIBOL would propose eligible subprojects to the SCU for submission to IDA for IDA's&#13;
authorization to receive financing under the remediation program, and for IDA's agreement upon&#13;
procurement arrangements. As subprojects are implemented, the procurement methods to be&#13;
followed would be as described in paras. 30-37. Subproject proposals would include:&#13;
(i)    certification by the SCU that the proposed investment had been selected on the basis&#13;
of the eligibility criteria included in the Operating Manual;&#13;
(ii)    proposed engineering designs, proposed procurement methods, and draft procurement&#13;
documents requiring IDA's prior review;&#13;
(iii)   any environmental assessments required under Bolivian law or Regulations, or IDA&#13;
policy. In instances where such environmental assessments revealed potential negative&#13;
environmental impacts from the proposed subproject, the subproject proposal would&#13;
provide for a mitigation program, satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
(iv)    evidence that all requisite permits required under Bolivian laws and Regulations,&#13;
including those required by MSDE (or the relevant authority) under such laws and&#13;
Regulations, had been obtained;&#13;
(v)    evidence that a proposed monitoring program to assess subproject impact had been&#13;
agreed with MSDE (or the relevant authority), and that MSDE (or the relevant&#13;
authority) would share monitoring data with IDA, and&#13;
(vi)   evidence that any special arrangements necessary for the implementation and&#13;
sustainability of the subproject had been agreed between involved parties in a fashion&#13;
consistent with relevant IDA policies and practices in Bolivia (e.g. regarding projects&#13;
on intemational waterways, or resettlement).&#13;
The SPC would propose to IDA all subprojects which complied with the above requirements for&#13;
financing under the Project's remediation investment program. Contracting of consulting services,&#13;
equipment and works for remediation would be carried out by the SCU, in accordance with&#13;
procurement procedures agreed under the Project.&#13;
29.   As part of Project supervision, IDA, the ECU, SCU and COMIBOL would participate in&#13;
routine Project supervision missions, normnally at six-monthly intervals. Each year starting in 1996, one&#13;
of these missions would conduct an annual review (not later than March 31 of the respective year),&#13;
inter alia to identify priority actions for implementation attention and forthcoming activities to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
addressed in the annual implementation plans to be prepared, respectively, by the ECU and the SCU&#13;
(para. 45). A mid-term review of Project execution would be carried out by IDA, the ECU and the&#13;
SCU not later than March 31, 1998 to take stock of accomplishments and introduce agreed corrective&#13;
measures, on the basis of implementation experience gained to date. Such review would cover inter&#13;
alia: (i) the adequacy of institutional arrangements and implementation of the various components of&#13;
the Project; and (ii) a discussion of the findings and recommendations of all studies financed under the&#13;
Project. Project progress would be judged through specific monitoring indicators (Annex 7).&#13;
2.    Procurement&#13;
30.   Under the Project, works would include construction and repair of small tailings dams and&#13;
settling ponds, construction of drainage canals, moving of mine tailings, paving of playgrounds, and&#13;
erection of fences as safety barriers, in the case of remediation investments, and construction of simple&#13;
buildings or installations, in the case of the laboratory component. Goods would include office&#13;
equipment and four-wheel drive vehicles, laboratory equipment, pumps, water treatment plants,&#13;
impermeable liners, and piping. Consulting services in the areas of engineering design and a variety of&#13;
multi-disciplinary technical, economic and financial services would be required.&#13;
31.   Procurement of goods, works, and services financed by IDA under the Project would be&#13;
carried out, respectively, in accordance with IDA's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits, January 1995" and "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and&#13;
by the World Bank as Executing Agency, August 1981." Items financed by the NDF would be&#13;
procured in accordance with its guidelines, which provide inter alia for Nordic Competitive Bidding.&#13;
32.   IDA-financed consultants to advise the ECU regarding aspects of Project implementation or as&#13;
participants under the Regulatory Studies would typically be internationally-recruited individuals with&#13;
specific expertise hired on an ad hoc basis to complement experts financed by NDF. IDA-financed&#13;
consultants to advise the SCU regarding the design and execution of remediation subprojects would&#13;
likely be hired through an internationally-recruited firm. Consultants (promotores) to be hired by the&#13;
Secretariat of Mines to advise mining communities on means to attract non-Project resources (para. 14)&#13;
would be locally-hired individuals. Consultants under the laboratory component would likely be a&#13;
combination of firms and individuals, as appropriate to the varied assignments expected to emerge&#13;
under the program.  In this regard, the contract for the initial phase of the study to inventory&#13;
laboratories has been let (following IDA procedures), for execution with Government of Canada&#13;
funding. In order to preserve continuity in expertise, it is likely that the two subsequent phases of the&#13;
study (estimated to cost US$44,000 equivalent) would be awarded on a sole-source basis using IDA&#13;
funding.&#13;
33.   Wherever possible, services, goods or works for various tasks would be grouped to limit the&#13;
number of contracts required, and achieve economies of scale and scope.  In the case of the&#13;
remediation activities for the mining sector, it is expected that a single firm would be contracted by the&#13;
SCU to provide advisory services to the Secretariat of Mines regarding the adequacy of proposed&#13;
engineering designs, environmental assessments and monitoring programs for subprojects, and to&#13;
supervise subproject implementation. Goods, works and engineering design services for subprojects&#13;
would be identified on a site-by-site basis, and procured on the basis of appropriately packaged lots.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
An Implementation Schedule for each Project component, a Summary of Procurement Arrangements,&#13;
and a Schedule of Procurement Actions are included, respectively, at Annexes 2, 3 and 4.&#13;
34.   Procurement Methods. In order to accommodate the broad range in the size and type of&#13;
contracts likely to be financed under the Project, the following procurement methods are proposed.&#13;
For procurement of (i) civil works, ICB procedures would be applied for contracts exceeding US$3.0&#13;
million equivalent in value, NCB procedures would be used for individual contracts with values&#13;
exceeding US$250,000 but not exceeding US$3.0 million equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$5.2 million equivalent, lump-sum fixed-price contracts, awarded on the basis of three&#13;
quotations, would be used for minor works valued at US$250,000 equivalent or less per contract, up&#13;
to an aggregate amount of US$1.7 million equivalent.   For procurement of (ii) goods and&#13;
equipment, ICB would be applied for contracts exceeding US$150,000. For specialized equipment&#13;
for the laboratory component which is only available from a limited number of suppliers with local&#13;
service/maintenance facilities (a) LIB would be used for individual contracts valued over US$50,000&#13;
equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$200,000; (b) international shopping would be used for&#13;
individual contracts valued at more than US$25,000 but not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$ 100,000; and (c) national shopping would be used for individual contracts&#13;
valued at less than US$25,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000. For non-&#13;
laboratory equipment and other goods and materials (a) NCB would be used for individual&#13;
contracts valued at more than US$25,000 but not exceeding US$150,000, up to an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$200,000 equivalent, and (b) national shopping would be used for individual contracts valued&#13;
at US$25,000 equivalent or less, up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000 equivalent. Special&#13;
provisions for national competitive bidding and the employment of consultants have been agreed with&#13;
the Borrower, in order to align procurement practices under the Project with IDA's requirements.&#13;
35.   Standard Documents. The use of standard bidding documents (SBDs) issued by FDA is&#13;
required by FDA's 'Guidelines for Procurement" for all ICB and LIB procurement. In addition, the&#13;
use of SBDs issued by the Borrower and acceptable to IDA would be mandatory for all procurement&#13;
under NCB. Similarly, for consulting services contracts exceeding US$150,000 equivalent in value,&#13;
the use of standard forms of contract issued by rDA would be mandatory, as would the use of standard&#13;
forms of contract issued by the Borrower and acceptable to IDA for consultants contracts of less than&#13;
US$150,000 equivalent in value. NDF would negotiate separately the procurement documents to be&#13;
used under its financing.&#13;
36.   Prior to issuance, FDA would review: (i) all engineering designs; (ii) all consultants' TORs,&#13;
short lists (for firms) and qualifications (for individuals), and evaluation criteria for firm selection; (iii)&#13;
all consultants' contracts valued at US$50,000 or more for firms, or US$10,000 or more for&#13;
individuals; (iv) all works contracts procured through ICB, or valued at more than US$0.5 million&#13;
equivalent, and the first NCB contract for works prepared by the SCU or ECU, as the case may be;&#13;
and (v) all ICB or LIB contracts for goods, and the first NCB contract for goods prepared by the SCU&#13;
or the ECU, as the case may be. fDA would be assisted in these regards by the consultants hired to&#13;
provide advisory services to the ECU and SCU. In addition to the documentation provided for prior&#13;
review as stated above, all other procurement documentation would be retained by the SCU and the&#13;
ECU, as appropriate, and be subject to selective ex-post review by FDA. The above-mentioned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
arrangements for prior review by IDA will ensure that contracts subject to prior review will represent&#13;
approximately 75% of the total value of IDA-financed contracts.&#13;
37.   The procurement thresholds, which are consistent with Regional recommendations for IDA&#13;
procurement in Bolivia, are summarized in the Table below.&#13;

3.     Disbursement&#13;
38.    In order to give autonomy to MSDE and MED in carrying out Project activities, a Special&#13;
Account would be established in US dollars in the Central Bank on behalf of each Ministry. Each&#13;
Special Account would bear its own authorized allocation and initial deposit. Within the overall&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
authorized allocation of US$800,000 under the credit, US$300,000 would be allocated to the Special&#13;
Account for MSDE and US$500,000 would be allocated to the Special Account for MED. The&#13;
authorized allocation for each Special Account is based upon four months' estimated average&#13;
disbursements for activities to be implemented by the associated implementing agency. The validity of&#13;
all Applications for Withdrawal requesting payments from any Special Account, including those&#13;
Applications based upon Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), would be certified by the ECU or the&#13;
SCU, as relevant.&#13;
39.   Under Project Administration, external sources would purport to cover 100% of net-of-tax&#13;
incremental expenditures for key local staff, goods, equipment and works related to the ECU and&#13;
SCUs, and a declining share of net-of-tax incremental operating costs for the ECU or SCU over the&#13;
four year Project period. Taking into account average tax rates levied on consultants' services and&#13;
goods and works acquired in Bolivia, this principle implies that external sources would finance: (i)&#13;
100% of expenditures under approved foreign or local consultants' contracts, (ii) 100% of foreign or&#13;
ex-factory local expenditures for goods and equipment; (iii) 84% of expenditures for locally-procured&#13;
imported equipment and installation charges; (iv) in the case of the ECU, 85% of incremental operating&#13;
costs, up to an aggregate amount of US$400,000 equivalent; 56% of incremental operating costs, up&#13;
to an aggregate amount of US$600,000 equivalent; and 28% of incremental operating costs thereafter;&#13;
and (v) in the case of the SCU, 85% of incremental operating costs, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$250,000 equivalent; 56%  of incremental operating costs, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$350,000 equivalent; and 28% of incremental operating costs thereafter.&#13;
40.   Under the regulatory studies, laboratory, and technical assistance for environmental&#13;
management in mining components, external sources would purport to finance 100% of net-of-tax&#13;
expenditures. Taking into account average tax rates levied on consultants' services and goods and&#13;
works acquired in Bolivia, this principle implies that external sources would finance: (i) 100% of&#13;
expenditures under approved consultants' contracts; (ii) 100% of foreign or ex-factory local&#13;
expenditures for goods and equipment; and (iii) 84% of expenditures for locally-procured imported&#13;
equipment, installation charges, and works.&#13;
41.   Under the remediation component, external sources would purport to finance 100% of net-&#13;
of-tax expenditures for consultants' services and 100% of net-of-tax expenditures for goods and works.&#13;
Taking into account average tax rates levied on consultants' services and goods and works acquired in&#13;
Bolivia, this principle implies that extemal sources would finance: (i) 100% of expenditures under&#13;
approved consultants' contracts; (ii) 100% of foreign or ex-factory local expenditures for goods and&#13;
equipment; (iii) 84% of expenditures for locally-procured imported equipment and installation charges;&#13;
and (iv) 84% of expenditures for civil works.&#13;
42.   Under training, external sources would finance 100% of associated expenditures.&#13;
43.   Expenditures would be disbursed against SOEs certified by the relevant implementing agency&#13;
(i.e. ECU or SCU, as the case may be) for: (i) all contracts for works valued at less than US$0.5&#13;
million equivalent, except for the first contract procured through NCB by each implementing unit; (ii)&#13;
all contracts for goods valued at US$150,000 equivalent or less procured through NCB or national or&#13;
intemational Shopping, except for the first contract procured through NCB by each implementing unit;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
(iii) all contracts valued at less than US$50,000 for consulting services by firms, and US$10,000 for&#13;
consulting services by individuals; and (iv) training or operating costs. Detailed documentation&#13;
evidencing expenditures would be retained by the implementing agencies and would be available for the&#13;
required audits (para. 47) and for the review of IDA supervision missions.&#13;
44.   The proposed credit is expected to take about three years to commit and seven years to&#13;
disburse. A Summary of Disbursement Arrangements under the IDA credit is included at Annex 5, and&#13;
a Schedule of Forecast Disbursements by financing source is included at Annex 6.&#13;
4.    Monitoring, Reporting, Financial Management and Auditing&#13;
45.   The ECU and the SCU would each maintain appropriate accounting records in which all&#13;
financial transactions under the Project would be registered. These records would be based upon an&#13;
appropriate Chart of Accounts to identify funds received from all sources (IDA, NDF, and the&#13;
Government) and register all expenditures, classifying them to provide timely information useful for&#13;
financial monitoring of Project execution. The records would form the basis for generating monthly&#13;
financial statements to inform the EPC and SPC on the status of implementation of those Project&#13;
activities falling under their respective jurisdictions. Beginning in July, 1996, the ECU and the SCU&#13;
would each prepare and forward to IDA semi-annual reports (respectively by January 31 and July 31&#13;
of each year) on the status of implementation of those Project activities failing under their respective&#13;
jurisdictions. The aforementioned monthly financial statements would provide the financial data to be&#13;
included in these semi-annual reports. Moreover, as part of its reporting, the ECU would share with&#13;
IDA environmental monitoring information on the impact of Project-financed remediation investments&#13;
in the mining sector which MSDE (or the relevant authority) would collect in its role as the&#13;
environmental monitoring authority under Bolivian law. To facilitate preparation of the previously-&#13;
mentioned reports, COMNIBOL would provide the SCU, in a timely fashion, with: (i) a status report on&#13;
its various environmentally-related programs, including any studies or technical assistance activities&#13;
financed under the Project; (ii) a status report on the execution of its various eligible subprojects,&#13;
including cost and financing data related thereto; (iii) a status report regarding the environmental&#13;
impact of its Project-financed remediation works, based upon monitoring programs agreed with&#13;
MSDE (or the relevant authority) as part of the subproject design (para. 28); and (iv) a note&#13;
highlighting any special issues related to Project execution. In instances where issues were highlighted&#13;
for resolution, the ECU or SCU, as relevant, would propose recommended actions. By October 31 of&#13;
each year, beginning in 1996, the ECU and the SCU would each prepare and forward to IDA an&#13;
annual implementation plan detailing project activities contemplated for the subsequent calendar&#13;
year, and outlining counterpart funding requirements. These estimates of counterpart funding&#13;
requirements would inform the budgetary requests by the respective agencies during the annual&#13;
formulation of the national budget. Within six months of Project completion, IDA, the ECU, the SCU&#13;
and all beneficiary institutions under the Project would collaborate in producing: (i) an Operational&#13;
Plan, indicating how Project activities would be sustained; and (ii) an Implementation Completion&#13;
Report to assess Project effectiveness and its contribution to sustainable development activities.&#13;
46.   The Central Bank, which would be the depository for funds in the Special Accounts, would&#13;
provide the ECU and the SCU each with separate monthly statements reflecting the deposits and&#13;
withdrawals in each Special Account. The ECU and the SCU would forward these monthly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
statements to IDA, in conjunction with their respective monthly Withdrawal Applications soliciting&#13;
funds from the Credit Account to replenish the respective Special Accounts. Moreover, the ECU and&#13;
the SCU would each keep separate records for all financial transactions affecting the Special Account&#13;
for the respective entity. As before (para. 45), these records would be based upon an appropriate&#13;
Chart of Accounts so that funds from IDA, NDF, and the Government may be accounted for&#13;
separately. At the end of each year, the ECU and the SCU would prepare annual Project Financial&#13;
Statements pertaining, respectively, to Project activities under the ECU and the SCU.&#13;
47.   The annual Project Financial Statements pertaining, respectively, to Project activities under the&#13;
ECU and the SCU, would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, in accordance with&#13;
IDA's Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing. Each audit report would include the auditor's&#13;
opinion on the fairness of presentation of the Sources and Applications of Project Funds during the&#13;
year, and the Project Assets and Liabilities as at year end. The audit reports would also include&#13;
separate opinions on: (i) the eligibility of transactions in the Special Accounts during the year, and on&#13;
the closing balance of these accounts; and (ii) on the eligibility of expenditures claimed under the&#13;
Statement of Expenditure (SOE) disbursement procedure. The ECU and the SCU would each submit&#13;
its respective audit report to IDA. All audit reports would be submitted to IDA within six months&#13;
following the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
5.    Benefits and Risks&#13;
48.   In the short run, the Project would help remediate priority environmental problems in mining&#13;
communities. This would yield economic benefits from improvements in human health, economic&#13;
infrastructure, or ecosystems, and from the removal of impediments to fresh private investments, which&#13;
would raise incomes. While economic returns from the various remediation subprojects would depend&#13;
upon local conditions, investments in several other Bank and IDA-supported environmental projects&#13;
have estimated rates of retums exceeding 20% arising from improvements in human health. The&#13;
Project would also help upgrade testing laboratory capabilities, thus assisting with development of a&#13;
credible national environmental monitoring capacity. In the medium-term, the Project would help build&#13;
policy and institutional capacity to mitigate future pollution flows in mining and industry. It would also&#13;
help improve worker health and safety conditions in existing and future mining and industrial&#13;
enterprises. In the longer-term, through its programs to encourage pollution prevention at the firm&#13;
level, the Project would facilitate development of more efficient and sustainable mining and industrial&#13;
sectors. Moreover, through training programs for counterparts during implementation of various&#13;
studies, the Project would help strengthen the national manpower base in environmental management.&#13;
49.   The major technical risk is that the project design would be inappropriate. This risk has been&#13;
managed by basing it on the findings of a sectoral EA, and reviewing Project components carefully&#13;
with stakeholders. The major economic risk is that remediation funds would be misallocated. This has&#13;
been managed by agreeing with the Secretariat of Mines upon a methodology and a set of criteria that&#13;
would be applied to select only those investments that would have high benefits relative to costs for&#13;
financing under the Project (Annex 8). The major implementation risks are that: (i) MSDE's limited&#13;
institutional capacity and experience with IDA and NDF projects may lead to delays in inter-&#13;
institutional coordination and Project execution; (ii) identification and implementation of investments&#13;
under the remediation component may be delayed and Project disbursements may lag; and (iv) lack of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
counterpart funds could delay execution of remediation works. These risks will, respectively, be&#13;
managed by: (i) providing a team of consultants to advise the ECU; reviewing IDA and NDF&#13;
procedures carefully with counterparts during Project preparation and start-up; and agreeing upon&#13;
standard procurement documents early in the Project; (ii) agreeing upon a core program of remediation&#13;
activities in the mining sector, and a priority set of activities under the laboratory upgrading program&#13;
during Project preparation; and (iii) financing an ample share of remediation investment costs from&#13;
external sources, and reviewing forthcoming counterpart funding requirements during annual reviews&#13;
timed to inform annual budget decisions.&#13;

BOLIVIA&#13;
ENVIRONMENT, INDUSTRY AND MINING PROJECT&#13;
Selection of Sub-Projects for Inclusion under the&#13;
Environmental Remediation Component of the Project&#13;
I.    Process&#13;
A process has been established for the selection of priority investments under the EIMP. This&#13;
process contains two major steps, which are detailed in two documents in the Project File. The&#13;
first involves selecting the priority mine sites on the basis of the risks they pose to human health&#13;
and the environment. The second step involves choosing thepriority investments and activities at&#13;
a particular site. The objective of the process is to identify the enviromnental problems which&#13;
have high human and economic costs and the investments likely to provide the largest benefits for&#13;
the money spent5.&#13;
H.    Selecting priority sites&#13;
The key steps in selecting priority sites can be summarized as follows.&#13;
Stage I: Preparing an inventory of sites and ranking the sites by their hazard potential&#13;
The first step in setting priorities is to compile an inventory of the universe of mines/facilities&#13;
under consideration for inclusion in the Project. This includes simple basic information such as&#13;
the size of the mine, the minerals extracted, and the size of the population likely to be exposed to&#13;
environmental pollutants.&#13;
The sites in the inventory are then scored using a set of numerical criteria to identify the sites&#13;
which are likely to pose the most serious threat to human welfare and the environment. The&#13;
scoring system is weighted towards those sites which may generate significant quantities of major&#13;
pollutants and which may expose a large population to health damage and economic loss.&#13;
5 The two steps are described in detail in the reports "Selecting Sites for Remediation of Environmental Problems&#13;
due to Mining in Bolivia" (Draft, October 1995), and "Selecting Highest Priority Investments for Environmental&#13;
Management in Mining Communities in Bolivia" (Draft, October 1995).&#13;

Stage 2: Investigating priority sites&#13;
This stage involves visiting the sites that have been identified in Stage 1 as "priority sites" in order&#13;
to confirm the initial identification and to assess the nature and extent of hazards present that may&#13;
warrant remediation.  The initial visits provide quick overviews or "rapid environmental&#13;
assessments" of site conditions, based on visual inspection and collection of immediately available&#13;
information. It is intended that the assessments should last no longer than a day or two. Field&#13;
workers record the physical conditions at the site, note any evidence of chemical contamination&#13;
and would provide a first estimate of the severity of the danger to human inhabitants or to the&#13;
environment. It is essential that the assessment cover not only the site itself but also the areas&#13;
surrounding the site which may have been affected by contamination from the mine.&#13;
Stage 3: Assessing the nature and extent of environmental damage at the site&#13;
Sites judged to be a source of serious damage are targeted for a more complete assessment of&#13;
environmental conditions (usually called an "audit"). In addition to providing information on the&#13;
sources of pollution and possible remediation options, these audits would focus on the human and&#13;
economic impacts of the contamination in as much detail as possible. The audits must include&#13;
impacts occurring outside the mining property (off-site effects). The main economic impacts to&#13;
consider are human health, materials damage, and ecosystem damage. For example, human health&#13;
problems can be caused by exposure to environmental pollutants in the air, water, soil, and food.&#13;
In Bolivia, the main contaminants from mining harming human health are likely to be lead in the&#13;
air, water, soil, and food, arsenic in the air and water, cadmium in the water and food, and, to a&#13;
lesser extent, cyanide in the air and water. Therefore, to ascertain whether the mining&#13;
contamination is damaging health, the audit would provide data on drinking water quality,&#13;
ambient air quality, and data on food and soil contarnination and data on human health.&#13;
m.   Choosing investments and activities for environmental management at a particular&#13;
site&#13;
The information in the audits on sources of pollution and on the damages caused provide the basis&#13;
for determining those remedial investments which should be given priority. The basic principle is&#13;
that priority be given to those investments which provide the greatest improvement in human&#13;
health and environmental conditions for the money spent. As far as possible, the benefits would&#13;
be expressed in monetary terms. Where this is not possible, the benefits would be expressed in&#13;
terms of physical impacts, such as number of cases of illness avoided, number of bushels of crops&#13;
saved, etc. The list of possible actions is then ranked in terms of the benefits and costs of each&#13;
proposal. There will be uncertainty in the quantification of the benefits but the methodology&#13;
produces, at a minimum, a grouping of projects according to estimated benefits, even where it is&#13;
difficult to produce strict rankings for each project. The selected projects are those which have&#13;
high benefits, low cost and a predicted high level of effectiveness and reliability.&#13;

IV.   Present Status&#13;
It is planned to carry out environmental audits on fifteen properties. As of July 1995, four of&#13;
these audits have been completed. The remaining eleven should be completed by December 1995.&#13;
On the basis of the available information, including inspections of some of the sites and&#13;
discussions with relevant experts within the industry, a preliminary set of remediation actions has&#13;
been identified for the priority sites. This preliminary list is based on identified areas of high&#13;
health impact and significant damage due to past mining and on advice from mining specialists on&#13;
remedial actions. The actions included are those which have high returns to the remediation&#13;
investments, based on present information. The list will be reviewed and will be revised as&#13;
necessary as additional environmental audits and other studies -- such as the Oruro Pilot Project --&#13;
are completed.  The preliminary investment proposals have been discussed with both the&#13;
Secretariat of Mines and the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment and are&#13;
considered to address the most important problems arising from environmental contamination due&#13;
to mining. Not all the high priority activities will be financed under the Project, however. The&#13;
Project would finance, on a pilot basis, only those priority subprojects for environmental&#13;
management which (i) had their origin in mining activities; (ii) were the responsibility of the State&#13;
under Bolivia's environmental liability provisions; and (iii) could not be addressed with financing&#13;
from other sources, such as FIS, FNDR, and FDC. In addition, the Project would finance&#13;
remediation activities that remove impediments to private investment in COMIBOL mines in&#13;
those cases where legal remedies would be insufficient to alleviate concerns of private investors&#13;
about liability for past contamination, and cleanup by COMIBOL would be demonstrably cost-&#13;
effective. The methodology for carrying out the cost-benefit studies, and the associated&#13;
investment decision criteria, would be included in an Operational Manual to be adopted under the&#13;
Project and applied during Project execution.&#13;
The following tables present investments and activities that appear likely to generate large&#13;
benefits. These are the investments and activities which should receive priority for further data&#13;
collection so that full cost-benefit analyses may be carried out.&#13;

            The Environment, Industry and Mining
            Project will: 1) support the implementation and refinement
            of a regulatory framework to assure that privately-led
            mining and industrial activities grow in a more
            environmentally-friendly fashion; 2) help remediate
            contamination from past mining activities for which the
            state accepts liability, including remediation activities
            that help facilitate private investment in the mining
            sector; and 3) assist in attracting non-project resources
            for investments which are not eligible for financing under
            the project in mining communities, in order to address
            urgent environmental problems, e.g. for potable water and
            sanitation. The project will include the following
            components: 1) studies to support the development of the
            regulatory framework, which will include basic data
            collection and policy development implementation; 2)
            laboratory upgrading for the implementation of a program to
            foster development of credible laboratory testing services
            in Bolivia; 3) remediation investments, which will be done
            on a pilot basis and only for those eligible subprojects
            comprising priority environmental management measures; and
            4) technical assistance and training to support
            environmental management in mining.
