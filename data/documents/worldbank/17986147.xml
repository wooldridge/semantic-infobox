[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Answer these four questions as to what do we do in this department&#13;
which is very different the rest of the asset side of the Bank. It's a very insular&#13;
department which is not well known in the Bank but is very well known in Wall Street,&#13;
and so the slide show is a little bit designed to remedy that. So I give it to the Executive&#13;
Directors or visitors or foreign central banks, our own traders when they come in and so&#13;
forth.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, and then for historians like you guys.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: The main question is therefore what do we do. The second one is how are&#13;
we organized to do this; more correctly, how do we run something that is so private-&#13;
sector-like inside a bureaucracy like the Bank. The third question is how do we know&#13;
whether we're doing a good job or a bad job; and what is interesting in this area is that we&#13;
can measure this every day, whereas in the rest of the Bank you take 15 years to know&#13;
whether the dam will silt up or not! And then the last section is on what sort of special&#13;
problems do we face in running this.&#13;
&#13;
So, on the first question, what do we do, itâ&#128;&#153;s best seen with this history again, balance&#13;
sheet of a year ago and x years and y years ago. On the asset side, â&#128;&#156;Lâ&#128;? stands for&#13;
developing country loans. "I" stands for investments or liquid assets or liquid portfolios&#13;
[inaudible] It represents about 15% of total assets [inaudible] 10 years ago. In the old&#13;
days it was almost 30% of total assets. Here in the middle it was about a quarter. We are&#13;
becoming proportionately less liquid over time, but we're still very liquid by comparison&#13;
to most corporations in the world. And on this side is the borrowing, paid-in capital, our&#13;
reserves. The sum of [inaudible] paid-in capital is 20 billion. Often people believe that&#13;
this matches this [most of this section is barely audible] but thatâ&#128;&#153;s not what we do. In&#13;
essence the whole thing has been engineered such that we have a large portion here of&#13;
assets for which we have been createdâ&#128;&#148;these are the high risk, low liquidity assets of the&#13;
Bank. And what we do here is the opposite: we go for low risk, highly liquid assets.&#13;
And we sort of link these 2 types of assets into the balance sheet and it becomes a safer&#13;
balance sheet overall. The . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That's really helpful.&#13;

                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                  June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So the people that work hereâ&#128;&#148;there are some 5000 people working in this&#13;
part that are completely developing-country-oriented, in this part are completely&#13;
developed-country-oriented. So we observe Japan, the U.S., France, and we are deeply&#13;
into those markets rather than the developing countries. So the whole approach is the&#13;
opposite one. The business and total net income of the Bank is 1.2 billion for the last two&#13;
or three years. It used to be half a billion 10 years ago and 200 million was a great&#13;
number 20 years ago.&#13;
&#13;
Many people believe that we are contributing the whole net income. The reason goes&#13;
like, â&#128;&#156;Well, you guys made roughly 8% on 20 billion, thatâ&#128;&#153;s 1.6 billion, so therefore the&#13;
whole net income comes from there.â&#128;? That, of course, is not correct because we may&#13;
make 1.6 billion of income, which is roughly the figure that we make, but the money had&#13;
to come from this side somewhere, and it had a cost. So the net contribution as opposed&#13;
to the gross 1.6 billion is something on the order of 100 million dollars, 200 million in a&#13;
good year.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Excuse me, do you have a printed version of this?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, I can give you a . . . [both speaking at once] Do you want them&#13;
now so that you can scribble on them?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, if they are handy.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Okay. So the question is why do we hold that much of our assets in these&#13;
short-term, relatively short-term very liquid holdings. What's the idea behind it? It's all&#13;
driven by this formula which we talked about, this liquidity policy, which means there are&#13;
in essence 70s in that form, but it is up to 40 percent or 45 percent of the borrowing&#13;
requirements of the next 36 months. So some fellow in the Bank calculates how much&#13;
we need to borrow over the next few years, and we try to keep roughly 45% of that figure&#13;
in this department in that very liquid portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
The next question, of course, is [inaudible] what's behind this policy. And what's behind&#13;
it is a calibration--which is not scientific, but it's sort of best-judgment calibration--that&#13;
says something like we want to be able to survive roughly a year without borrowing&#13;
anything in case of a very dramatic scenario. One scenario would be where there is&#13;
turmoil in all the financial markets in the world, and we cannot borrow. Another scenario&#13;
is where we have been hit by such loan losses or even debt repudiation--that would be a&#13;
very dramatic scenario--by very large borrowers and we are unable to go and place our&#13;
bonds with the very conservative investors that usually buy them. And we have to&#13;
abstain from going to the market.&#13;
&#13;
So this was--the 45 percent gives us about a year to a year and a half of autonomy&#13;
without borrowing anything. And why a year to a year and a half because in such a&#13;
predicament--there is a very low probability, a disastrous scenario but a low probability--&#13;
we would probably need a year to a year and a half to mount a rescue action [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So it's buying ourselves time to support the whole place in case of a very negative&#13;
scenario. Why do we need to buy ourselves time is because being a super-national bank&#13;
we cannot go and refinance ourselves in case of need as the Banque de France or the&#13;
Federal Reserve or Bank of England. And (A) there is no such agreement and (B) weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
not one of the national banks so that we don't have access to theirâ&#128;&#148;this kind of financing&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So the Bank has the so-called central bank . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, that's just paper that we sell to the central banks.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, we sell bonds to large investors and Swiss investors and mutual funds.&#13;
We also sell bonds to central banks, and they buy them because it's a commercial&#13;
proposition. It's a small way of borrowing. It's a small part of our borrowing.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It would be, however, the first line of defense probably in face of such a shutout&#13;
...&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: To go to central banks?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, I know [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, the first line of defense would be to draw our money down.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No, I realize that. That's for [both speaking at once] I mean apart from that.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, first we would draw it down. As we draw it down, we would have&#13;
sort of a year of survival time during which we would do all kinds of things. Yes, we&#13;
may go to central banks. We may get more paid-in capital. We may get a capital&#13;
increase, we may get [inaudible] capital or whatever. But there is absolutely no&#13;
agreement under which we can go today and ask for 4 or 5 billion of credit lines from the&#13;
central banks.&#13;
&#13;
Also, if we're going to go and ask for reinforcements, we're going to do it with the&#13;
ministries of finance to ask for more share capital. At the same time, if we're hitting&#13;
their central banks, we're doing a little bit too much for the Bank. So this is all&#13;
theoretical in the sense we never had this scenario, but we still have to have this in case&#13;
that scenario exists.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But people have sort of said over time that, look, this is such aâ&#128;&#148;I mean, a&#13;
liquidity policy, such a low risk [inaudible] that it, it was very conservative . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It is, but your--I buy life insurance, but I assume my probability of dying&#13;
is relatively small in the next 20 years. But I still buy it. So it's a low-probability&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
scenario, but you have to be prepared for it because the World Bank is a very risky&#13;
lender, and if it doesn't have ultra-conservative buffers--this is one of the buffers--it&#13;
wouldn't be there after all these years. The other buffer is the high level of reserves and&#13;
capital that we have. But this is the first important buffer.&#13;
&#13;
Also, our bondholders have now seen this liquidity for years. The rating agencies&#13;
calculate the liquidity ratio. Ours is actually the smallest of all the development banks,&#13;
and they don't like that. And so we also have to show this to our bondholders. Again, we&#13;
are the riskiest lender on earth, probably. At the same time weâ&#128;&#153;re sort of constantly--we&#13;
sell our bonds to the most conservative people on earth. If you get these two complete&#13;
extreme opposites together, you have to have things like that even though one could&#13;
argue, yes, the probability is small, and there could be all kind of reasoning like this. Of&#13;
course itâ&#128;&#153;s compensating insurance. I know that I'd rather have insurance if I'm going to&#13;
run a bond-raising machine that basically is the last resort lender for the developing&#13;
world. So I think . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is this a big selling point with selling bonds?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, yes. Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: When they see this . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, it impresses them. It's one of the things they look forward to when&#13;
they buy a bond. When you sell--you have to buy bonds of several development banks,&#13;
and one has a big cushion of liquidity and one has none, which one would you rather&#13;
buy? Would you rather buy the one which has economy?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I would think that there are two aspects: one is that this is like a guarantee of&#13;
instant convertibility and a ready market. The Bank will always buy back--to guarantee&#13;
the existence a very liquid market for the bonds by having all this [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Particularly guarantee a year of survival time without borrowing. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
what this is all about.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The other aspect is in your loans, the risk that [inaudible] back.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Back for what?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The government guarantee.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, the riskiest countries on earth, yes. Triple B or Single B countries,&#13;
and on the other side I'm selling Triple A bonds.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And you guarantee [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, the callable capital.&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The callable capital.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yeah, but the callable capital is the money that's not shown here. It's the&#13;
capital we can call in in the case of need, but we can only call that one under&#13;
circumstances specified in the Articles and that is basically when we cannot pay our&#13;
bonds back. Okay. So not being able to pay our bonds back is an extreme scenario,&#13;
whereas with this liquidity we could survive a year or a year and a half without&#13;
borrowing, but we still keep disbursing our loans. In other words, the machine is an&#13;
ongoing machine. The callable capital is what you only call in when you're almost&#13;
bankrupt and you can't pay back the debentures. You cannot call it back before that. So&#13;
this thing here enables you to survive a year as a going concern because when they&#13;
calculate the net cash requirements for the next few years, the biggest items in there are&#13;
the disbursements that we're committed to make under already-committed loans.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I guess what I'm groping for is that it seems to me there are 2 different risks&#13;
involved although they are related. One is the loss of the value of the bond, but the other&#13;
risk, which is the one that you're emphasizing in terms of more operational--your&#13;
machine breaks down . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. If the machine is unable to borrow--and it's a machine that gobbles&#13;
up 12 billion of borrowings every year, and a lot can go wrong. In '75 we were forbidden&#13;
to borrow in the U.S. by the U.S. government, and had we not had this big cushion, I&#13;
mean, that would have been a very serious blow. And this year there is a withholding tax&#13;
change in the parliament in Germany right now which makes us unable to borrow a&#13;
single deutschemark, and we have been unable to borrow it now for months. So we are&#13;
shut out of the deutschemark market for the time being. And those are huge sums for us&#13;
which are involved. So this machine here is there to prevent incidents like this from&#13;
slowing us down, to give us flexibility, but it also prepares us for the terrible accident&#13;
where we can't borrow anywhere for quite awhile. And if we are the riskiest lender on&#13;
earth, we may--it may be low probability, but it's certainly higher for us than for anyone&#13;
else. And so we have to be prepared.&#13;
&#13;
So the reason people like to argue the thing is they think that carrying this liquidity has a&#13;
cost. If it doesn't have a cost, you don't care whether we have 45, 35. But for years&#13;
people have been running around this concept of cost of carrying liquidity, that there is a&#13;
cost of carrying liquidity. In true fact there is no cost of carrying liquidity. If we were&#13;
allowed to borrow what we have in this portfolio, if we have LIBOR [London Inter-Bank&#13;
Offered Rate] in this portfolio we borrow LIBOR against it. If we have fixed-rate bonds&#13;
of the U.S. treasury we would issue fixed-rate dollar bonds on the other side. If we&#13;
match-funded this we would make a little money rather than lose the little money which&#13;
we have. But there is no major cost in carrying liquidity.&#13;
&#13;
Now when it comes to insurance, maybe for low probability where it's (A) very important&#13;
for the whole safety of the machine, itâ&#128;&#153;s important for the bondholder, then it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t cost&#13;
much, if anything. So the arguments for saying, "Oh, you can get by with 25%," yes, I&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
can't prove it has to be 45%. It could be 37.2%. But all I'm sure of is that it had better be&#13;
there.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Has there been much debate on that forecasting system?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: There was much debate in the early â&#128;&#152;80s, as I remember.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Who was pushing for lower rates?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It was a time when this happened here, when this plateaued, and it&#13;
plateaued because the Bank's net disbursements slowed down. This was the [Robert S.]&#13;
McNamara period. And then there was aâ&#128;&#148;as the disbursements slowed down on a net&#13;
basis, the liquidity tended to overshoot a little at 55%, 52%, 50%. We could never get it&#13;
down to 45%. And this was purely the hydraulics of the fact of the slowdown in&#13;
disbursement. The whole thing had a lot of momentum. And now we're sort of easily at&#13;
this level, as you know, as a whole. As the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States]&#13;
countries, beginning with three, four, five billion of lending a year, that disbursing&#13;
[inaudible] will be the other way. We will have an acceleration here, and we will follow.&#13;
We will be at 38, and people will say, "Why aren't you at 45%?" and you'll have the&#13;
opposite debate. You'll have an acceleration related to [inaudible] and here we had&#13;
deceleration. So the Board would get very excited about this in this sort of period, yes,&#13;
â&#128;&#152;84, â&#128;&#152;86.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The debate was about how to reach the target rather than [both speaking at&#13;
once]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, how to--the debate was how to bring the target, the actual down&#13;
from 55 to 45. The thinking was when you do that, you truncate the borrowing program&#13;
in that year. So you have a borrowing program that's 9 billion, 9 billion, 10 billion, 11&#13;
billion at a time. If you want to go down in one crack from 55 to 45, you have to go 9&#13;
billion, 9 billion, 6 billion, 10 billion. And that is absurd. If you are a big borrower, you&#13;
don't yank around your borrowing volume by 4 or 5 billion. So it was difficult for the&#13;
[Eugene] Rotberg people to actually produce this 45 percent quickly as the Bank&#13;
decelerated and we had to move to become smaller. In this way it will be easier because&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s easy to step up their borrowing program; itâ&#128;&#153;s harder to bring it down.&#13;
&#13;
These debates would be--there would be Board members and Gene Rotberg on the other&#13;
side and [Moeen] Qureshi [inaudible] And the Board members fell into two categories:&#13;
there were those that knew roughly what they were talking about, and then there were&#13;
those that took a veryâ&#128;&#148;there were those that had a sort of policy in their mind which said&#13;
something like, "Why do you guys need more capital? All you need to do is spend your&#13;
20 billion," which is a turkey argument, but, you know, it's emotionally very strong. So&#13;
these are people that mix up capital, liquidity. They don't realize that liquidity is&#13;
borrowed. There were some of these populist arguments involved in it, too, and it was&#13;
very hard to sort of take--distinguish all these things because this is complex material.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Also in those years the Bank was tying its GCI [general capital increase] to&#13;
the debate.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So people would say, "Why did you need a big GCI? You have all this cash&#13;
lying around."&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It's a complete fallacy but emotionally a very strong one. So that was the&#13;
nature of the debate. I think of those departments in here, I haven't heard a single debate&#13;
on this nor on the cost of carrying liquidity. I mean, all this is better understood now--&#13;
maybe because theyâ&#128;&#153;ve come to the slide show. [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It really helped one person.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And when they come with the populist arguments, I'd tear them apart,&#13;
because itâ&#128;&#153;s far more effective than writing a Board paper, if you ever have tried that.&#13;
&#13;
In this, the other part, the currency composition of this thing has changed quite a lot. In&#13;
the old days, actually, it was further down, the dollar was very important--it was almost&#13;
65% of the whole and the rest would be these high, high nominal currencies [inaudible]&#13;
and French francs. What you see here is a sort of re-engineering of this liquidity into&#13;
something that increasingly would be sort of a third Japan, a third [inaudible] or&#13;
deutschemarks or something and a third dollars. That re-engineering is just the mirror&#13;
image of what has happened on the loan side as we discussed. So the loan side has been&#13;
re-engineered into this predictable one-third, one-third, one-third cocktail. As that has&#13;
happened, the borrowing side has begun to look like that. And we, as the residual of the&#13;
whole machine, we are beginning to look like that, too.&#13;
&#13;
The important thing is that from our standpoint we don't make these decisions. So we're&#13;
unique amongst--we're one of the biggest investors in the world in the bond area, but&#13;
we're fairly unique in being fully--we cannot decide on which currency we have. So that&#13;
makes our job in a way easier because when you run a big sum like this and you trade it,&#13;
you have two decisions to make every morning. The first decision is "Should I be in&#13;
deutschemarks or in French francs this morning?" The currency decision. The second&#13;
decision is, having decided to be two-thirds in French francs and one-third in&#13;
deutschemarks, â&#128;&#156;Am I in the 10-year bond area or in the 7-year bond area in francs?â&#128;&#156;&#13;
That's the bond-trading decision. In our case we don't make that first decision. We're&#13;
told how many French francs and deutschemarks we have by the system, and we don't&#13;
tinker with it. So all we do is to try to find the best bond market trades using those&#13;
allotted currencies. And our whole mental energy goes into that, and we don't waste any&#13;
time trying to forecast exchange rates, which is very difficult to do.&#13;
&#13;
So I think one reason we're doing decently well here is that we have this huge emphasis&#13;
on understanding the bond markets, the yield curves, the interest rate plays. We don't&#13;
have this paralyzing anxiety that point exchange traders have.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
These 20 billion being there for this very rainy day, to help us survive a year without&#13;
borrowing. By the way, this is the case for all our clients, IFC [International Finance&#13;
Corporation] (we manage decisions for them), the trust funds are a little bit different, and&#13;
IDA [International Development Association] we manage [inaudible] . In total we&#13;
manage 25, 26, some days 28 billion dollars.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Are there conflicts in the IDA? There you areâ&#128;&#148;I mean, the U.S. might say&#13;
that we gave X billion but you [inaudible] money with the yen [inaudible] IDA.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, well. It is very complex, but this complexity we don't know about.&#13;
We just know what we are given every day.&#13;
&#13;
Take the trust funds: they get disbursed by some other people. All we need to know, and&#13;
the only link to this department in the Bank, the only thing we need to know is when&#13;
they'll need money from us, and how much money will come in for us. We could sit--the&#13;
whole department is self-contained. We could sit, for instance, in the Bahamas; all we&#13;
would need to know is what's going in and out, and we need to know a little bit in&#13;
advance [inaudible] enough for the interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What is the time horizon you have? About a month or a week or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Now, a few weeks is enough, and even a few days would be enough if&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;s a crisis. So since this money is there as a sort of cash hoard to help us survive a&#13;
very rainy day, we have to be prepared for that rainy day. So we have to preserve the&#13;
capital. What we do is--we are given 20 billion, and we have to be able to supply it to the&#13;
Bank when they want to draw it down. At the same time since it's a low probability event&#13;
that we will be drawn down--we will probably have it for a long time--so we might as&#13;
well make as much money on it as we can.&#13;
&#13;
So there is a preservation-of-capital objective and a making-as-much-money-as-you-can&#13;
objective which are contradictory, but those are still the two objectives we have to work&#13;
on. So the way we square this circle with these two different objectives, contrary&#13;
objectives, is that, first, we are very active managers. We could be passive, but we're&#13;
very active when in trying to make money--but weâ&#128;&#153;re very highly risk controlled because&#13;
of the whole raison dâ&#128;&#153;etre of the liquidity. The activity level is something like 127,000&#13;
transactions per year or 500 or 600 a day which--a lot of those transactions are rolling&#13;
over of overnight deposits. But a lot of it is futures trades, bond trades, going into the 17-&#13;
year bond in the U.S., 17 minutes later going out. There's a lot of [inaudible] trading&#13;
going on. The trading level is high, but it was higher in '85 or '84â&#128;&#148;it was an even higher&#13;
number of transactions. In volume terms the sum of all the buys and sells in the year&#13;
would be 2.5 trillion dollars. In the mid-â&#128;&#152;80s it was up to 5 trillion or so, so weâ&#128;&#153;re half as&#13;
active as we were.&#13;
&#13;
Now, together with this activity, which is geared to making money, is a high degree of&#13;
risk control. To give you a flavor of what that means, if we put the whole 20 billion for&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] into 30-year U.S.&#13;
bonds, which is something we could theoretically do, perhaps. Weâ&#128;&#153;re not going to do it.&#13;
If interest rates went up 1% tonight, we would lose 11% percent of the 20 billion in one&#13;
night. And, of course, we would lose 2.2 billion tonight. And if we lost 2.2 billion, we&#13;
[inaudible] the market every day; but we cannot, even in unrealized losses, recognize&#13;
enough [inaudible] We would basically ruin the whole profit of the Bank which is only&#13;
1.2 billion. So we cannot do that. We have to have the whole thing managed in a band&#13;
that's not plus or minus 2 billion but more or less plus or minus 200 million, thatâ&#128;&#153;s how&#13;
we manage it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: All the rest is hedge.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, all we do isâ&#128;&#148;as I explained, we keep away--we do have--we can&#13;
buy 30-year bonds, but we'll buy on the future and we'll keep the whole average life of&#13;
the portfolio down to a number that is more like one year. What we can buy is only&#13;
fixed-income instruments, stocks are forbidden, commodities are forbidden [inaudible] .&#13;
Within that class, which are basically instruments with an interest rate [inaudible] , you&#13;
have two types. We have half the portfolio roughly in sovereign bonds and the other half&#13;
in commercial bank deposits. That's more or less the ratio, 50-50. In the sovereign class,&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s really government bills, which are short-term paper, notes which go from 2 to 10&#13;
years, and bonds that are from 10 years to, well, there are some at 60 years. And its&#13;
governments, can be agencies of governments, like Fannie Mae in the U.S. or AAS(?) in&#13;
France; but they always have to be Triple A. And we can buy the other banksâ&#128;&#153; paper,&#13;
which we do.&#13;
&#13;
On the commercial bank deposit side, which is the other half, there we have to be far&#13;
more conservative because here we have to deal with governments, and here we have to&#13;
deal with central banks which are covered for the governments somehow but not&#13;
completely. So we keep these all short. So most of it is overnight. The bulk, besides the&#13;
overnight, the rest are mostly term deposits to 1 month. We keep to 3 months, and if we&#13;
go beyond 3 months, we have to go into CDs, which are negotiable. We can't go beyond&#13;
6 months maturity at all.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So these are self-imposed.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: There are--all these are self-imposed rules to keep the risk within an&#13;
acceptable loss. The commercial banks are tremendously selective. There are 14,000&#13;
banks. We deal with 120. And the 120 that have been selected are Triple A, Double A, a&#13;
few are Single A plus if they are very strong, nothing under Single A plus. And they tend&#13;
to be a very large, well-capitalized banks.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Has it ever been that anyone on the Board has sort of said, â&#128;&#156;Why not more in&#13;
my country?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, because they wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t--in fact they wouldn't make the credit criteria&#13;
which would is Single A plus minimum, which is a very high hurdle, and there is a whole&#13;
&#13;
                              Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                            June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
system for establishing for each bank what its credit line will be from us, what exposure&#13;
[inaudible] . And all this system is--cannot be tinkered with. As I said, if a credit is&#13;
coming to you, there are rules that are published, and there is no way a Board member&#13;
would [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
So basically we then buy and sell these things and those we place and then we do three&#13;
more arcane things. The repurchase agreements we do a lot in the U.S. market.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, what we do is, if I have a 10-year bond, I can do two things with it.&#13;
I can either sit on it until I sell it. If I sit on it Iâ&#128;&#153;ll get the interest every day. Or I can put&#13;
it to work, and that's what you do with repurchase agreements. So if I put it to work, I'll&#13;
take my bond and I will lend to you for one night. But you are a broker, so I don't trust&#13;
you. I will therefore get cash collateral against my lending you that bond in the same&#13;
amount. And on that cash collateral I'll pay you 4% for one night. The cash I will then&#13;
take, this cash collateral, I will place it with you at Chase Manhattan for one night at four&#13;
and one-eighth percent for one night. The next day I will get back the deposit from you,&#13;
and I will give you the cash collateral back, and I'll take my bond back. And so in this&#13;
whole thing you needed to borrow the bond, and we did it in such a way that I will earn&#13;
one-eighth of a percent for one night [inaudible] And if you did that on lots of paper&#13;
over time, that's worth millions of dollars. And that is a veryâ&#128;&#148;that is part of any very&#13;
liquid capital market like the U.S. The reason he needed to borrow my bond is that he&#13;
had gone short. He had sold the bond to [inaudible] and when the settlement day came&#13;
he had to borrow it from me to be able to deliver. Why did he go short? Well, maybe he&#13;
thought it was a good move to go short.&#13;
&#13;
Futures and options: we do a lot of futures. Basically, what futures are, you can buy a&#13;
10-year bond, or you can buy a future on a 10-year bond. In terms of the impact on the&#13;
riskiness of the portfolio, it's exactly the same thing. People always think futures are far&#13;
more risky. They think that because you only make a small down payment so you're&#13;
leveraged out. But the impact on our interest rate profile here is the same between&#13;
buying a 10-year bond or buying a future on a 10-year bond. So we are quite indifferent.&#13;
And we take futures a lot because they are very, very safe in terms of--the exchanges are&#13;
safe on which they are traded. It's anonymous. The transaction costs are very low, and&#13;
you can move big amounts very quickly without disturbing the market. Options is the&#13;
same thing as a future, but there is a lottery element in it; and it's also no more unsafe&#13;
than anything else as long as you know how to measure the impact of these tools on your&#13;
interest rate activity. They're all equivalent ways of expressing the market [inaudible] .&#13;
&#13;
And covered calls is something we do. We're forbidden from converting one currency&#13;
into another, as I said earlier. And this is a sort of swap, in a sense. I will convert&#13;
deutschemarks into French francs, but I immediately line up the forward foreign&#13;
exchange contract to come back from French francs to deutschemarks. And if I do both&#13;
the spot transaction into French francs and the forward back into deutschemarks, I can&#13;
actually--I haven't taken any foreign currency position. We do lots of those. We do them&#13;
&#13;
                                 Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                               June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to move money from one portfolio to the other. We are not breaching the non-&#13;
conversion--the part of the Article that says we can't convert anything is actually a little&#13;
more flexible than that, but it has always been applied in the Bank as being a prohibition&#13;
to converting.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But on the borrowing side this is not true. Is that right? You have swaps&#13;
going on a lot.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But a swap is the same thing. A swap is where you've covered forward&#13;
except itâ&#128;&#153;s longer distance. You have one leg going into this new currency and you have&#13;
the other leg going out several years later. So it is net net--there is no . . .&#13;
&#13;
This is done with some 80-some people. We have two types of [inaudible] traders and&#13;
[inaudible] people. The traders are organized in 4 groups of 7 each. [inaudible] These&#13;
people do the bond trading in the U.S. and Canada. These people do the bond trading&#13;
everywhere else, Europe and Japan. These people do all the deposits, you know, since&#13;
half of the portfolio is deposits that what they can do, and they do that worldwide. And&#13;
these people are traders, but they're more researcher types. They trade new instruments.&#13;
They try computer [inaudible] trading. They are delivering technical assistance to&#13;
foreign central banks in Zaire, Czechoslovakia [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
They are also doing something very important. That is the division that sets the&#13;
benchmark against which we measure these guysâ&#128;&#153; performance. Because they are&#13;
slightly independent and therefore they can do a good job at creating benchmarks that&#13;
those guys find very hard to beat. [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
So these people trade on the telephone mostly. The biggest share is through brokers. The&#13;
only case where we go directly to the issuers is in the launch, otherwise they go through&#13;
brokers. So they pick up the phone and they say, "I'll buy 100 million 10-year bonds at&#13;
98," and they put that into their computer, and their computer prints a so-called trade&#13;
ticket. The ticket is then given to these people, and these people then do all the sort of&#13;
checking and logistics following that trade. A trader will forget that trade. Heâ&#128;&#153;ll know he&#13;
has [inaudible] but he may sell that paper 15 minutes later.&#13;
&#13;
But even on the first buy when he bought this paper, there are 12 steps these people have&#13;
to go through. They have to call the broker and confirm that the trade did take place and&#13;
that the price was right and that there is no disagreement on the terms of the sale. They&#13;
then have to check that the interest accrual has been calculated correctly in the price.&#13;
They have to take delivery of the bond somewhere in New York, and they have to pay for&#13;
it that day. So there is a lot of paperwork involved. If you made 127 transactions here&#13;
per year, these people would do a million and some. And then we have a huge systems&#13;
group or [inaudible] because we have to keep track of everything, not only of all we have&#13;
in the portfolio, but all the transactions that were made, all the payments that have to be&#13;
made, the settlements, everything that's pending. You require very vast systems. The&#13;
core system is in a machine that has almost a million lines of Fortran code. And so you&#13;
need systems developers, which is one group. You need people that run the systems--&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
some of them are on that line. And you need facilities people that if the hardware goes,&#13;
the air conditioning, this machine which we need for the trading strategies . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Are those systems all developed here, by in-house . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: A lot of it is developed here, and a lot of it is purchased outside. But even&#13;
what you purchase outside, you always have to adapt it. For instance, this big one-&#13;
million-line machine, we basically helped get it going 10 years ago, and all that's in it, all&#13;
the interest rate formulas for all the bonds in the world, we actually put in ourselves. But&#13;
the system is now commercial, and they're selling it to other groups. So we're often&#13;
involved in the birth of these things because we are sort of established international&#13;
[inaudible] But there is always a crew of at least 10 people doing development work on&#13;
something.&#13;
&#13;
All these systems all have a risk-management purpose somehow. They catch commercial&#13;
bank exposures. They catch over-exposures. They catch the interest rates in the&#13;
portfolios, the payments flow. So it's also interesting that this is an internal group. We&#13;
don't rely on other systems because this is a very specialized group.&#13;
&#13;
This here is an interesting unit. This is independent from us. Those are under the&#13;
Treasury. Those people are--make sure that we don't breach the so-called credit. There&#13;
are two risks when you have a portfolio. The first risk is that the value of your portfolio&#13;
goes down because interest rates did something. That's the so-called interest rate risk or&#13;
market risk. The other risk is the risk that interest rates do absolutely nothing, but still&#13;
your portfolio goes down. If that happens it would be because the financial health of the&#13;
issuers of the paper was perceived to go down. So if New Zealand goes from Triple A to&#13;
Double A, the value of its paper will go down even though nothing has happened to&#13;
interest rates. Those people are the ones that watch for that risk, because as profit&#13;
maximizers we will tend to go to the riskiest papers to make more yield, and they're the&#13;
ones to make sure this doesnâ&#128;&#153;t happen. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s why they are independent. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re also&#13;
the ones to screen the commercial banks, tell us which paper we can buy and not buy and&#13;
so forth.&#13;
&#13;
The people that populate this are mostly World Bank people that come from irrigation,&#13;
we have a lot of highway engineers [inaudible] There are industrial projects officers. I&#13;
was one, and I got several more. There are agronomists. There are country economists,&#13;
the repo traders [inaudible] They are people who are not natural traders, but their&#13;
fondness for the World Bank [inaudible] and for some reason they have an interest in&#13;
capital markets. And so in mid-career or after a few years in the Bank they then come&#13;
here. And then we train them on the job, and we start them in this [inaudible] area here&#13;
where they can't do much damage. And then, as they move up, they can rotate from job&#13;
to job. All the traders rotate every 12 months. They all have to move over time, from job&#13;
to job.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you have a lot of turnover?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, I'll talk about that. We have a lot of turnover, and rotating people&#13;
has something to do with training, but it also has something to do with fighting turnover&#13;
problems. There are a lot of women in the Bank. In the Bank the [inaudible] percentage&#13;
of women at high levels is 20 percent. In this area it is 50 percent. So we have--like here&#13;
we have 6 division chiefs; half of them are women; and a year ago 4 of them were&#13;
women. And in the high level women at large, it's 50 percent. The whole department is&#13;
52 percent women. It is quite, quite different culturally from the rest of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible] at the Bank or any particular . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I asked the [inaudible] to these women's issues in the Bank and said,&#13;
"Why don't you study and tell us why, why did this happen. Was there a technical reason&#13;
like non-travel, they donâ&#128;&#153;t want to travel, is it because they're the wives of husbands who&#13;
are in the Bank--which is not the case, actually--what is it?â&#128;? I don't know. Is it&#13;
something that happened early and then has been self-sustaining?&#13;
&#13;
All I know is that there are good reasons for me to have women managers here because in&#13;
trading there is always the risk of ego inflation and deflation, and women have a lesser&#13;
tendency to that than the average male. When it comes to running a team, you want the&#13;
managers to be sort of unflappable and not prone to trying to go for home runs. And so&#13;
women do have better qualities as trading managers. They are also more industrious in&#13;
terms of housekeeping and being organized. All these people live in a submarine&#13;
atmosphere, in one room. So women are also better at the inter-personal atmosphere.&#13;
There are lots of things that probably cause us to have this, but I can't put my finger on&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Another kind of trading, outside in Wall Street, is that true also?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: You will find a great number of women on the floors. They tend to be in&#13;
sales rather than in trading, whereas in our case this is all trading, and you have a high&#13;
proportion of women.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is there a special dialogue to this job [inaudible] very good at verbal skills?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It's all verbal. Nothing gets written here. Everything is talking, listening,&#13;
getting information from brokers.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Quick calculations?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Quick calculation, yes, is important. It's . . .&#13;

[End of Tape 1, Side A]&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Street and here, they trade practical jokes all the time. There is a sort of release of the&#13;
tension. We also do certain things. For instance, the people that stay in this box all day,&#13;
we bring themâ&#128;&#148;we pay for lunch every day. They get--lunch is brought to them, and&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It sounds quite different from the culture of the rest of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, it is, it is quite different. It's verbal. Vaguely kind of plastic. And&#13;
again completely directed to next fiscal package in Japan or the U.S. budget amendment&#13;
and things like that. Itâ&#128;&#153;s directed another way. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re very--they follow the news a lot,&#13;
of course. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re very, very--you take any trader. He knows everything about&#13;
Maastricht and about the latest thing. They watch TV a lot. They have Court TV and C-&#13;
Span and CNN, and they often watch it in their room. But it's a very short-term horizon.&#13;
Everything sort of is a week away.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I guess they must be the best informed people in the Bank on politics&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, on things like that, by far, yes. But in a short-term projection horizon,&#13;
not for the long-term.&#13;
&#13;
This is an impressionistic view of the day of a trader in that there's 24 hours there in a&#13;
way. The U.S. trading would be roughly from 7:30 â&#128;&#152;til 5:00 p.m. There are lots of things&#13;
besides trading. They have to check computer runs over night, the prices that have been&#13;
given to their pieces of paper are correct. They have little meetings to discuss what has&#13;
happened during night in the other markets. They trade--around noontime they have a&#13;
meeting to recap what has happened in European markets which are then closed. There's&#13;
a little bit of a strategy meeting for the next day. Some do research in the afternoon,&#13;
particularly those whose markets are closed, the European traders. And so about 2:00 to&#13;
4:00 p.m. that peters out. But even though the U.S. traders are finished at five, they will&#13;
often sell or buy U.S. paper in Japan during the night. So it sometimes goes on until&#13;
midnight or so. These two people here, they trade in the middle of the night. They start&#13;
at 8:00 p.m. and they finish at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. And then they come to the&#13;
office around noontime to participate in that recap meeting.&#13;
&#13;
The systems are run by night shift at the point where we have all the prices from the&#13;
[inaudible] And then European traders start at 3:00, 4:00, 5:00 in the morning, trade&#13;
until about 8 o'clock, come to the Bank, continue until noontime. Half of them have the&#13;
same stations at home as they have here. They have FAXes, special phone lines, Reuters,&#13;
Telerate, the whole thing. They can do it from home. But the most [inaudible] stations&#13;
are of course for those people [inaudible] The working hours are not very important.&#13;
The U.S. traders can go home at 3:00 or 4:00 or 5:00â&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s really their business. They&#13;
tend to live with this anyhow, and even if they go home at 3:00, they may still be trading&#13;
at 11 p.m. without anyone knowing because they are [inaudible] markets.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you place any limits on how much the traders can trade in a day or&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                            15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
amount?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, there is a sort of 1984-like scrutiny system here that measures every&#13;
trader's performance every day. So that's the sort of thing that they feel watched by. Itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
not--well, there are risk management systems. Whenever they do a trade the system in&#13;
front of them tells them what their risk profile is, their P and L [profit and loss] . And it's&#13;
updateable so they know what the risk is, but they also know the next day how well they&#13;
did compared to a benchmark that is very hard to beat. So that is sort of controlling the&#13;
whole thing.&#13;
&#13;
The job of a trader is actually quite hard in the sense that they have 3 things to do. They&#13;
have to buy and sell which this verbal telephone call [inaudible] They have to--which is&#13;
very unusual here--we get them to trade, but we also turn them into strategy decision-&#13;
makers every Monday morning in this room. And the traders here then become&#13;
economists, and they are the ones to say what they want to do in each country and sort of&#13;
target the markets. And when you hear them do that, they sound like Wall Street&#13;
economists. When you hear them trade, they sound like Wall Street traders. In Wall&#13;
Street they would compete. Here itâ&#128;&#153;s the same person that will do both. Why? Because&#13;
presumably in each case, itâ&#128;&#153;s this Ph.D. in economics anyhow and is perfectly able to do&#13;
this and to analyze it and project what will happen in the Japanese market next week.&#13;
&#13;
They also have to do housekeeping, which is very important. Behind that buy and sell&#13;
decision is a host, an enormous amount of information: mounds of publications, all the&#13;
electronic screens, complex analytical packages where you can do all kinds of interesting&#13;
calculations. They have to keep in mind where they stand in the reporting of risk, talk to&#13;
the others. They have to keep with the strategy that was decided on the Monday for one&#13;
week, and they have limits on the credit [inaudible] So there's a lot of input into&#13;
something that looks like, "Oh, 100 million dollars I'm buying now." There's a lot of&#13;
information coming in.&#13;
&#13;
The batting average of a good trader is maybe 55 percent wins, 45 percent misses. That&#13;
would be an excellent trader who's going to make a lot of money over time. But that&#13;
means that even a very good trader has 45 percent of failures. And that's why they're a&#13;
little tense. Every day, even if they traded beautifully for 3 days, the next day is disaster.&#13;
â&#128;&#152;Disasterâ&#128;? meaning that they lose the performance they have made in the previous days.&#13;
So that's why in general there isâ&#128;&#148;this is a crew that is 35-ish to 40-ish. There are&#13;
relatively few 40-year-olds.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible] Theoretically if everyone in the world is sort of reasonably good&#13;
[inaudible] it should wash out.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, it should wash out except that the whole market may move up. You&#13;
see, there is something to that. Yes, there is a--if you go short the bond and the other guy&#13;
is going to win or lose.&#13;
&#13;
The reason one can still trade despite this [inaudible] is that there are a lot of&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
inefficiencies in the market, contrary to economic theory, and a lot of what the traders do&#13;
is to find those inefficiencies. For instance, you rarely find them going and buying tons&#13;
of bonds in the U.S., but youâ&#128;&#153;ll find them buying the 4-year bond and selling short the 3-&#13;
year and 5-year around it so that net overall they didn't take a position, but they know that&#13;
the 4-year bond was especially expensive and the other ones were cheap--or the other&#13;
way around, as my example was. And that's the sort of stuff they will get some use out of&#13;
it. Or you'll find them, rather than going long Europe, they'll be long the 10-year bond in&#13;
France, short the 10-year bond in Germany. So net/net there is no big position on&#13;
Europe, but they'll bank on the interest rates in France coming closer to the German ones.&#13;
A lot of the older traders will bet like that.&#13;
&#13;
The risk management is enshrined in two documents. One is the investment authority&#13;
from the Board. That's only 2 or 3 pages, and it has the basic doâ&#128;&#153;s and donâ&#128;&#153;ts. Then there&#13;
are guidelines which run to12 pages which have the technical do's and don't's. This is&#13;
issued by the Board and rarely changed. This is issued by [inaudible] and will be&#13;
changed more often. And the content of these is like the constitution and the laws. The&#13;
content is always these three things: whose paper you can buy, which brokers you can go&#13;
to, what the maximum interest rate is here and what the maximum expenditure is, and it&#13;
explains how we manage this one.&#13;
&#13;
I assume you know this is an insulting slide for most people. The yield curve and how&#13;
bond prices move--the yield curve means that if I get 4% for overnight money in the&#13;
U.S., I will probably get something like 8% for 30-year bonds. And then the yield curve&#13;
is normal. In true fact it wobbles around, and it's right now inverted still in Germany.&#13;
You get a little more money here than you do in [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Not in the U.S.?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: The U.S. is the cheapest in [inaudible] fantastically cheap. You have the&#13;
short-term which is at 3.75%, and you are always at 8% on the bonds, which is unheard&#13;
of. There is thisâ&#128;&#148;very importantly what has been done here is the Fed [U.S. Federal&#13;
Reserve Board] pushed these rates down, enabling the banks to buy this [inaudible] The&#13;
banks are making a killing on their margin. If they get an 8% yield on the bond and they&#13;
paid 3.75, and it has helped the banks improving its earning in the sense of [all speaking&#13;
at once] in sense of P &amp; L.&#13;
&#13;
The other one is prices of bonds going to the opposite direction of interest rate&#13;
movements. This is the thing, a 5-year note, for example, the U.S. 5-year note, I buy it&#13;
for a thousand bucks from the government. It has 8% interest rate attached to it, and the&#13;
market for all 5-year notes that day is demanding an 8% yield. So that's where I start&#13;
from. If interest rates in that 10-year--that 5-year note market go up to 9% tonight and if&#13;
I tried to sell my 5-year note tomorrow, the market requires 9% and mine carries just 8%&#13;
interest rate, I will have to discount it down 40 bucks to even get rid of it because&#13;
whoever buys it at that discounted price with an 8% interest will then get that yield that&#13;
the market requires them to get. If that yield that the market requires goes down to 6.5%,&#13;
I'll be able to mark it up actually from where I bought it because if the market only&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
requires 6.5%, then we can pay that much and my 8% will get that. So what traders do is&#13;
they try to buy the paper here and sell it there in ever so many combinations, and as I said&#13;
they only succeed 55% of the time; 45% of the time they'll get it here and then sell it at&#13;
the worst time.&#13;
&#13;
So this leads me to the question of how do we control the interest rate risk. Well, the 5-&#13;
year note I just told you, when interest rates went up 1% we had to discount the paper&#13;
down 40 dollars, so it went down 4%. But the sensitivity of the 5-year note to a 1%&#13;
increase in interest rates is minus 4%. If you pay an overnight deposit, the sensitivity is&#13;
zero percent. It doesn't last long enough to be effective. But if you take the 30-year&#13;
bond, it will have this massive sensitivity. You remember when I said what happens if I&#13;
put the 20 billion into 30-year bonds? Well, we would lose 11% of the value, which is&#13;
where that [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I don't understand the duration . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, let's forget about it for the time being. Each piece of paper has a&#13;
reaction to interest rate movements that is very strong here, none here, and somewhere in&#13;
the middle here.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's proportionate to the terms?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It's proportionate to--not only to the terms but also to the type of paper.&#13;
For instance, if you have a 30-year bond that is a normal bond, then you have that&#13;
sensitivity. If you have a 30-year zero-coupon bond, the ones that don't pay interest&#13;
until the end, it would have a 30-percent [inaudible] . They're both 30-year bonds.&#13;
&#13;
So there is a thing called duration which predicts exactly that sensitivity. And what it is,&#13;
the duration is for each piece of paper you take all its cash flow, and you calculate its&#13;
average life based on all its cash flow. And the trick is to use as the weights not the face&#13;
value of each cash flow but the present value of each cash flow. If you do that, you get a&#13;
number which is expressed in months or in years and which is called duration which is&#13;
actually predictable. [portions of this entire section are not audible].&#13;
&#13;
So what we do in the Bank here is we try to have a whole portfolio, whatever it's&#13;
composed of-- it has overnight deposits, it has 30-year bonds, it has everything--overall&#13;
we make sure that if it collapses under the aggregate to this level, which is the 1-year bill&#13;
which has a 1% sensitivity, meaning on my 20 billion, if interest rates go up 1%, tonight I&#13;
lose 200 million, which is fine because I got one and a half billion of profit. Also, I can&#13;
make--if interest rates come down, I'll make 200 million and which has a 1-year duration.&#13;
So if the whole interest risk control consists in capturing the durations of everything we&#13;
have--options, futures, bonds, bills and others--all the time it is the computers are making&#13;
sure that we always average out around here. That's 80% or 90% of the whole interest&#13;
risk control. It's not difficult to do, but you have to have powerful computers that catch&#13;
all these durations and correct data, correct pricing--everything has to be correct, but then&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s not difficult. That's why we don't care whether we buy a 10-year bond in cash or in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
futures. It has the same duration, or be called the same way.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Iâ&#128;&#153;m sorry. Letâ&#128;&#153;s see if Iâ&#128;&#153;ve understood this. You deal in 30-year bond but you&#13;
offset [both speaking at once] have a zero [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. [both speaking at once] If I have too many of those, I will have to&#13;
blend it with these guys here to make sure I come out here. This whole system puts a&#13;
natural lid on how many of these I can buy. Actually, you'll find us rarely having lots of&#13;
30-year bonds. Youâ&#128;&#153;ll find us a lot in the 5-year and 7-year area. And even if I had a lot&#13;
of 30-year bonds, I probably would sell some 30-year bond futures against that to max it&#13;
out.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Does each trader have to offset himself?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. No, each trader does his own thing, but they all see the collective&#13;
positions.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Wow! [both speaking at once] They see it on the screen.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, yes. They see their own little thing and sometimes they trade&#13;
opposite directions. You can have two traders in the same division, one is selling, one is&#13;
buying.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Because one trader might be--each trader might be tempted to go to lower the&#13;
risk.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, each trader hasâ&#128;&#148;I mean, we have a 12-month duration target in the&#13;
U.S. Each trader is allotted one month of duration as a departure from 12. They have&#13;
limits to do how much they can do, but it's always a duration limit of 12.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: At the same time, you have a program which is constantly solving the&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, no. I have a program that constantly calculates the duration, and then&#13;
there is no optimize or nothing. And the managers see the duration and they see whether&#13;
it compares to the strategy we decided on, and if it doesn't, they go in, say it was the&#13;
futures market, they will [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Are the instruments continuing to change things, or would you have to&#13;
recalculate the formula?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. We have to recalculate all the time because durations are dependent&#13;
on the structural characteristics of these figures, but they are also dependent on the&#13;
particular interest rate level of the day--not in major ways but enough that you need to&#13;
recalculate. But essentially, I mean, duration is nothing else but just simple elasticity,&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#153;s all it is. But it took the finance industry 30-some years to come up with it. Irving&#13;

                              Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                            June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fisher, the economist, he had proposed duration as a measure way back, he and [Darko&#13;
Mercoli?] , and it was just forgotten until the mid-â&#128;&#152;80s. And even as I speak now we are&#13;
quite good at these things but you have lots of central banks that donâ&#128;&#153;t run it this way at&#13;
all, that the central bank very often will say, "You can't buy anything beyond 5-year&#13;
maturity," thinking they're very conservative; but if you buy 4 years, which is far too&#13;
much. If I had that one I would lose 4% of 20 billion, which would be 800 million on&#13;
this side, which would be too much. And very few will have the set-up to actually&#13;
measure the duration live over time.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I said that was 80% of risk control. The remaining 20% is something like this: if&#13;
you have 10 bucks and you want to have a 1-year target duration like the World Bank,&#13;
you will have an infinite number of portfolios you can pick. This one, for instance, you&#13;
could put your 10 bucks entirely in the 1-year bills which then produces [inaudible] .&#13;
You could have this one, which you put 9 dollars overnight deposit and you keep 1 dollar&#13;
for the 30-year bond. You will use it to [inaudible] . That's called actually a bullet and&#13;
this is called a barbell because traders talk like that. But this one has 9 bucks at zero&#13;
duration which is overnight deposit [inaudible] and $1 at 10.6 years of duration, so it&#13;
averages out to one year as well. So these two portfolios have the same duration,&#13;
meaning if all interest rates in the world go up 1%, in which case I would lose 10 cents.&#13;
&#13;
Now, of course, the difference between the two is: suppose the interest rates only move&#13;
up in the long bond area, 30-year bond, but they don't move here because the Fed has&#13;
them under control. In this case nothing will happen to that portfolio, and this one will&#13;
decrease. I will lose a ton of money on this position. So in that sense duration only&#13;
measures the sensitivity of the portfolios to parallel shifts in the yield curve. What it&#13;
doesn't catch is tilt in the yield curve when the long rate goes up and the other one&#13;
doesn't. That second risk is what we call the yield curve risk. You cannot capture that.&#13;
You cannot easily capture that. You could, but it is extremely esoteric. And so that risk&#13;
we manage with our brains but not with a computer. It is a risk that is smaller than the&#13;
duration risk, if the duration risk is 100, this sort of yield curve which would be&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
The last piece is what, how did they get some sort of strategy. Each week on Monday all&#13;
the traders come here and we set the duration for the week in each portfolio. I said we&#13;
had a target of 12, but it doesn't mean we will actually have 12. It's just a target. So if we&#13;
like--right now this week we don't like the U.S. dollar market, we don't know whether it&#13;
is going to go up or down. So we have kept the duration at 12. And the yield curve we're&#13;
in the [inaudible] rather than over the curve. We have matched our duration in the area.&#13;
The deutschemark European market we like a lot despite Maastricht. We have the&#13;
duration at 20 months, far longer. So we have willingly exposed ourselves to interest&#13;
rates in Europe because we think interest rates will eventually come down. So we&#13;
[inaudible] . The yield curve there is all short lending [inaudible] but some are&#13;
[inaudible]. The yen market we like. We have it at 16 months, and there the position is&#13;
in the 10-year bonds. So each market we make that decision for one week. Once the&#13;
decision is made to have Japan at 16 months, the Japanese traders can go up and down&#13;
two months on each side. It can be either 14 or 18 for that week until we reconsider them&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
next week. So in our terms, we target at 12 months, but we keep departing from it in&#13;
order to meet this mythical benchmark that we set.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In theory, if the Bank had an inside track on, say [inaudible] the market, you&#13;
could . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But (A) we're not part of the G-7 meeting, and (B) the people that would&#13;
be sent there would be politicals who would be unable to come here and express their&#13;
own [inaudible] views, just give them a big speech on coordination and cooperation.&#13;
Read the communiquÃ©s of G-7 and extract a drop of wisdom. They're completely&#13;
mechanical. They're written weeks in advance, and you can almost guess them, they are&#13;
so devoid ofâ&#128;&#148;they have no sort of conflict of interest at all.&#13;
&#13;
There is a part of the house in PRE [Policy, Research and External Affairs] that does&#13;
these long-term projections. We have never been able to extract anything from them, nor&#13;
have they been able to extract anything from us. Their vision is for a much longer-term&#13;
thing, for the â&#128;&#152;90s. And our world is not the â&#128;&#152;90s; it's this week. Or does anyone see&#13;
anything at the Fed on the 30th of June? That's all--and that information will be of&#13;
interest to us but it's of no interest whatsoever to the people that produce all the long term&#13;
projections.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is the IMF [International Monetary Fund] any better?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: The IMF is a little bit like the projections people. They wouldn't be as&#13;
closely involved in the [inaudible] In the whole of Bretton Woods we're probably the&#13;
ones that are most short-term, [inaudible] but in a trading sense, not in a [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Does the Fund have its own portfolio?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, it has something but nothing like this. Also, this whole game, the&#13;
game is not necessarily to correctly analyze economic fundamentals. That is not going to&#13;
do any good. We have to guess what other traders will see in these pieces of information.&#13;
So you can have a piece of information coming out saying the budget amendment&#13;
legislation has not gone through. From the point of view of fundamentals it doesn't&#13;
matter who, but this may impact the psyche of a lot of traders and therefore the market.&#13;
So a lot of it is actually guessing economic announcements ahead of time, but then also&#13;
guessing what will happen once they come out. So a few weeks ago we correctly&#13;
guessed several times that the employment number would be very high, and we were&#13;
completely at variance with [Paul] Volcker, and we were right. It was 164,000 and we&#13;
had guessed 165, and we were [inaudible] But we lost a lot of money that day because&#13;
the market, which should have gone down that day, didn't. So we had guessed the&#13;
announcement right by doing all kinds of seasonal complications, very advanced ones,&#13;
but we completely misjudged the market's reaction to it.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Iâ&#128;&#153;m curious. Do you have--you manage the IDA and IFC. Is that all a pool&#13;
then, or . . .&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, it's separate pools, but it's managed in the same way. It's under the&#13;
same benchmark, the same technique, the liquidity positions for IBRD are the same as&#13;
IDA, but it's a messy thing. We have to have separate agreements, separate accounts that&#13;
our custodians need. It's very complicated.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Does that trader, does he know when he is trading with IBRD or IDA?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, the trader will say this is for IBRD and buy another 20 for IFC and 10&#13;
for IDA.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: The credit risk, I will skip over that. But that comes here.&#13;
&#13;
Those people are an independent unit. Their main job is to seek commercial bank loans.&#13;
And so they are entirelyâ&#128;&#148;also, they're an intelligence agency. Well, first of all they&#13;
restrain us by giving us all kinds of limits to which bank to support, but they are a useful&#13;
intelligence unit. They're trying to hear whether anything will happen to any of the banks&#13;
we work with. They talk to the rating agencies. They read all the newspapers in the&#13;
world, waiting, looking out for anything that could happen that would be unsettling.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the next question is how do we know whether we're doing a good job or not, and&#13;
that is basically this. It is all done here through a so-called benchmark portfolio. In other&#13;
terms, for each currency we have defined a theoretical portfolio but a very realistic one&#13;
that is basically the portfolio we would adopt if we went passive, if we stopped trading&#13;
that currency. So it's the best feasible passive strategy in each market. And it's defined&#13;
very realistically. It says exactly which bond [inaudible] we have in this [inaudible] .&#13;
And it is defined at 12 months duration and basically not only are they homemade but&#13;
they get improved over time. There is this shop that tries to make them harder and harder&#13;
to beat so they [inaudible] . And so this is the way we work. Right now we are&#13;
improving next year's, and we're doing things that will make it harder for investors by 10&#13;
million dollars, that is 10 million of the existing performance will be pulled into the&#13;
benchmark because we are trying to trick [inaudible] on the part of the benchmark.&#13;
&#13;
So that's the basic system. It's a neat system because it serves as a sort of anchor for the&#13;
whole Bank. It's a frame of reference for the strategy we use, but it's primarily a way to&#13;
measure everything from the performance every day. This would be the U.S. one. It's&#13;
roughly a third overnight, 50 percent buying and holding 2-year [I can't hear him well&#13;
enough to be sure he is saying "two"] notes, [inaudible] and 20% in basic securities. The&#13;
20% in basic securities are distributed at equal duration, the contribution of the 2-year&#13;
note is triple rated. If you ask me why, it's just because when we analyzed this thing 10&#13;
years back, there was a lot of value in triple rated [inaudible] . And then there are a lot of&#13;
those similar questions here, whether you keep the current bond or the bond that's one or&#13;
two auctions old, and there is a lot of fine-tuning in this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
If you look at the overall performance, the way we think about it is that we make a total&#13;
return every year. That return is the sum of the market return that anyone would get,&#13;
whatever that means, plus the value added to get [inaudible] our benchmark, plus the&#13;
value added we get from trading intelligently around that benchmark so that these are the&#13;
three sort of things that make up the whole return.&#13;
&#13;
This chart drives economists nuts! You can't have a benchmark that's smarter than the&#13;
market. If you do have it, the market will catch up with you, it will find a benchmark,&#13;
and there won't be a difference between this line and this line. And then the ultra-purist&#13;
economists say you won't even get this. No one can. You tried that on me [inaudible]&#13;
this side loses, you win and then [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. It's 7 years.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But Larry [Lawrence H.] Summers has written many articles on the&#13;
inefficiency of markets and on the fact that this really exists. And we know this one&#13;
exists, too, because we more or less [inaudible] So it matters, except we have a hard&#13;
time measuring what the market is. What is the market? So what we do is we compare it&#13;
to money managers in the U.S. [inaudible] So the money managers in the U.S.--there are&#13;
lots of them--but in the fixed-income class there are lots of them [inaudible] the 1-month,&#13;
there are the money market funds, and there is a 24-month which is particularly in&#13;
[inaudible] with bond market. If you average these 2 classes out, you'll get something&#13;
that is 12-month duration. Basically you look at this versus this other. And if we do that,&#13;
then we need to average here by 100 basis points by 40 basis points and by something&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible] the stock market?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I don't know. I wasn't there, and there were no statistics [both speaking at&#13;
once] for comparison. And also it's hard to tell because the last two years were market to&#13;
market, so the return we have is the real thing. It's the return including a [inaudible] In&#13;
the old days--that's why your historical series isn't worth much--you have book returns,&#13;
and book return has no relationship to the actual return; they have--unrealized losses are&#13;
ignored; unrealized gains are ignored. You cannot really tell what the performance was.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What [inaudible] gain and loss?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, if you buy this piece for a thousand bucks and it falls to 960 the&#13;
next day, under our system this 40 dollars will be a loss even though I haven't sold it. In&#13;
the old system you would not declare that 40 dollar loss because you hadn't sold the&#13;
paper yet. And then you hang onto it and it goes to 1063 and we then sell it, then you&#13;
declare a gain. But the loss that came in between you would never show up.&#13;
&#13;
                              Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                            June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's all on the purchase value rather than . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, the purchase value and the sales value will then determine a loss or&#13;
gain. In our case we run the whole portfolio at market values of the day and even though&#13;
we haven't sold that piece of paper, we will declare a loss of 40 dollars. But this system&#13;
doesn't lie at all. The old data areâ&#128;&#148;theyâ&#128;&#153;re not meaningless but they don't mean much.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You know, I'm sorry, but I should have been--Iâ&#128;&#153;m confused about a benchmark&#13;
of 800 million dollars. I thought a benchmark was a standard.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, it's a real portfolio. The benchmark is the portfolio we would hold in&#13;
the U.S., in France, if we just had three people here and we managed this very&#13;
mechanically. That portfolio is measured every day on the computer as if it existed,&#13;
and there are people that maintain these portfolios--they are just theoretical, but they&#13;
maintain them in a very lifelike manner. For instance, they will roll from one paper to&#13;
the other, and they will price the whole portfolio correctly. And so we calculate the&#13;
return on that theoretical but very realistic portfolio. Then we calculate the return on the&#13;
actual dollar portfolio, and we compare the two. Right now the dollar team is 35 to 40&#13;
basis points ahead of the return of the passive portfolio. And that is the sort of&#13;
performance we measure. Yeah, I should have explained that.&#13;
&#13;
And then we break it even down further. We take this big benchmark and we calculate:&#13;
the deposits are benchmarked, the 2-year notes are benchmarked, the 5- to 7-year notes&#13;
are benchmarked. And then we have individual traders trying to beat that piece of the&#13;
benchmark, and their performance gets measured against their subpart of the benchmark.&#13;
So we even have trader-by-trader readings on performance.&#13;
&#13;
The last piece on the question of how do we know whether we are doing a good job or&#13;
not is the question of how much does this whole thing cost. The cost is actually not very&#13;
large. The cost of this whole operation, including building, light, overhead, and&#13;
[inaudible] work in the Bahamas is [inaudible] The pure budget number on 3.5 billion&#13;
dollars, which is very little. We live on the core of about 25 billion, which is a huge&#13;
figure. That's one of the reasons why it's so low, because you have economies of scale.&#13;
However, it's much lower. If we went outside we would have to pay market for it and&#13;
we're not sure the performance would be any better. As a matter of fact, those U.S. data I&#13;
showed you show our performance is actually better consistently in the U.S. because (A)&#13;
we are doing a little bit better, but we also have a [inaudible] cost advantage which, of&#13;
course, has to do with no salaries, no profit margin, we've been at this for 20 years so our&#13;
systems are depreciated, and we do a lot of stuff ourselves.&#13;
&#13;
The settlement and accounting is often farmed out to commercial banks. We do it&#13;
ourselves for less than 1 million with secretaries. Our settlement division, our ex-World&#13;
Bank secretaries, some of which have levels 24, 26, and they go very high up in that&#13;
particular business. They're all very good secretaries. The issues are turnover, which you&#13;
had asked about and [inaudible] The turnover is a sort of natural thing. Citibank always&#13;
&#13;
                               Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
recruits people, and Citibank people always end up working for the brokers, particularly&#13;
in Europe. So Citibank, we're a little bit like that. We know these traders are not going&#13;
to stay forever, and now I lost 5 in the last year. They tend to go to Wall Street or back to&#13;
their countries or to Europe and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Is it essentially the salaries, do you think?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, yes, they get very nice additional salaries. On average they go for&#13;
two and half to three times the Bank's salaries. We just lost one of our best traders to&#13;
Goldman Sachs. So it's always in the making. It was slow when Wall Street was in the&#13;
doldrums, but now that Wall Street is coming out of that period we're losing people&#13;
again. So what we do to fight this is to do a [inaudible] help because by rotating these&#13;
people around all the time it's more interesting to them to stay longer because they do&#13;
Japan, Europe, the U.S. in three years, and that makes them even more marketable if they&#13;
stay this long. So basically the Bank system is this: if the U.K. trader walks tomorrow,&#13;
I'll have three [drowned out by cough] ex-U.K. traders ready to go who know the brokers,&#13;
who know the paper, the conventions in the U.K. market, and can immediately jump in.&#13;
&#13;
The other advantage is it creates an interesting strategy discussion because when the yen&#13;
trader talks--current yen traders--three ex-yen traders will argue with him, and it's an&#13;
interesting debate. The disadvantage is that you have people that go up a learning curve,&#13;
and then you take them into a position where they have to start again. So there is a&#13;
learning curve loss. There is a little dent in performance that we donâ&#128;&#153;t want, which we&#13;
can't measure but it really must be there.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing is we have a program where we take 4 or 5 World Bank people from all&#13;
kinds of places in the Bank as 9-month interns. And these people come here, they work&#13;
as traders in the money markets, and they have a re-entry guaranteed to wherever they&#13;
come from. So it creates a small corps of reserve troops at the Bank. And for many of&#13;
these people who work for the extra earnings; for example, a lot of IFC capital markets&#13;
people do that and then go back to [inaudible] The market is a real live experience rather&#13;
than an academic. And then we are always prepared by--because we have defined as our&#13;
benchmark not some sort of index published by J.P. Morgan but a lifelike theoretical&#13;
passive portfolio so that if we have big problems in turnover, actually when we do this&#13;
we take our vacations, when a lot people are out, we just go passive, we adopt the&#13;
benchmark, and the benchmark can be run with three or four people. We also do this&#13;
sometimes not because of turnover but when we had the Gulf War and we really couldn't&#13;
tell what the markets would do, rather than sit there and make political bets, we went&#13;
passive.&#13;
&#13;
So the benchmark also is a fallback strategy, and in that sense it serves--the benchmark&#13;
serves many purposes at once. It is a reference for decision-making; it is a performance&#13;
measurement system which acts as a control system at the same time (it is uniquely&#13;
focused on the things going on); and it is a fallback strategy in case of some turmoil&#13;
internally.&#13;
&#13;

                             June 18, 1992 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What we do now is we have started to do technical assistance with two or three people&#13;
that basically export all these tricks and these practices to the central banks in developing&#13;
countries. So that's why theyâ&#128;&#153;re in Czechoslovakia now and there they tell them about&#13;
trading profitably. A lot of it is about how they should have a central benchmark, how to&#13;
measure performance, what the backup is like. Itâ&#128;&#153;s sort of risk management, mostly, that&#13;
we export as knowledge, practical knowledge. We find a lot of central banks have&#13;
predicaments where the managers of the central banks don't know much about all the&#13;
things we've talked about today, but they'll have two or three traders there that have been&#13;
all hyped up by brokers about options trading--and then these guys sit there and make&#13;
huge trades sometimes. And the deputy governors and those people wouldn't even know&#13;
what a risk report looks like.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [both speaking at once] [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Where?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Mongolia. They lost their--a few months back the central bank was wiped out.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I didn't know about Mongolia, but I know about another country in that&#13;
whole area of the world where they had lost the whole of the country's [all speaking at&#13;
once] [inaudible] It may be the same story as it is in Mongolia. And it was one of our&#13;
staff that went there with the IMF, as this was part of the membership mission; and when&#13;
they went there, the IMF couldn't find the reserves. And it was one of our traders who&#13;
was very good at that who looked and looked and looked and found they had been lost by&#13;
the deutschemark forward trading. It was 5% of GNP. The people on top of this didn't&#13;
have any idea about what these traders were doing, but the traders were very crafty guys.&#13;
And the back office was an old lady with a pencil and some very poor quality paper.&#13;
But they had gone to courses with brokers, and the brokers had gotten them all excited&#13;
about these very advanced forms of foreign exchange trading. They had given them&#13;
Telerate screens, and they had that, but what they didn't have was the whole risk&#13;
management envelope to make sure they didnâ&#128;&#153;t . . .&#13;
&#13;
So that's what we're doing a lot of now but with just two or three people who are also&#13;
traders that rotate from trading to technical assistance, and then they go back.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Everyone knows the benchmark [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: A benchmark is not a big secret; it's just a decent passive strategy for us to&#13;
adopt. It may not be the right one for a central bank with 1 billion dollars because ours is&#13;
demanding. It requires a crew of 80 people. It has specialized deposits, years, mortgage&#13;
bag and support. It has all sorts of specialized traders in mind. A small central bank&#13;
should have a benchmark that is a mixture of short-term deposits and 3-year notes--&#13;
period. Those are good for one [inaudible] . That's what they should have. They should&#13;
have a very simple trading set-up--until they have all the risk management systems in and&#13;
they can do something more complex. But in looking for a benchmark, it is not so much&#13;
a question of let's make it the absolute most capitalist recipe for making money, but let's&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
make it a very plausible, realistic, passive strategy for the bank. And that's the question.&#13;
&#13;
We actually had a seminar two weeks ago here in the Bank for all the rich central banks--&#13;
the U.S., Germany, France, the whole lot--to [inaudible] what you get from the&#13;
benchmark, how to adjust it, all kinds of . . .&#13;
