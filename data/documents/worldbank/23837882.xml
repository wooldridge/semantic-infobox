  Box I: Global Economic Developments&#13;
&#13;
  The world economy is still struggling to gain momentum as many high-income countries continue&#13;
  to grapple with the legacies of the global financial crisis. Global growth picked up only marginally&#13;
  to 2.6 percent in 2014 from 2.5 percent in 2013. Growth in high income countries has increasingly&#13;
  diverged, with the United States gaining momentum while the Euro Area and Japan lagging behind.&#13;
  In the United States, apart from a temporary contraction at the beginning of 2014, growth has&#13;
  been above potential since mid-2013 and in the third quarter of 2014 reached its fastest pace since&#13;
  2003. The recovery has been supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, which bolstered&#13;
  capital market valuations, and easing fiscal consolidation. Improving labor markets have been&#13;
  marked by robust job creation and gradually increasing wage growth. Housing market conditions&#13;
  have improved while declining oil prices are boosting real household incomes. With slack in the&#13;
  economy diminishing, the first hike in the federal funds rate is expected around mid-2015, but the&#13;
  tightening is likely to be gradual due to subdued inflation expectations. In the Euro Area, activity has&#13;
  been weaker than anticipated, especially in France, Germany, and Italy. Concerns about long-term&#13;
  prospects and the legacies of the crisis (especially impaired balance sheets and high unemployment)&#13;
  weigh on a fragile recovery and diminish expected growth benefits from sustained low oil prices. Bank&#13;
  recapitalization efforts and continued deleveraging could still constrain bank lending in some parts of&#13;
  the Euro Area, despite the successful completion of the European Central Bankâ&#128;&#153;s (ECB) Asset Quality&#13;
  Review and the move to place the largest banks under single supervision. Financial fragmentation,&#13;
  high unemployment, structural rigidities, and unresolved fiscal challenges are likely to dampen&#13;
  the recovery. In Japan, at 0.2 percent, growth in 2014 fell significantly short of expectations as the&#13;
                                                                                            continued to next page&#13;

  economy struggled to recover from a sales tax increase in April 2014, and, until mid-2014, exports&#13;
  remained subdued despite a weak yen, reflecting soft global demand, the relocation of production&#13;
  facilities overseas, and rising cost of energy imports since the shutdown of nuclear reactors. While&#13;
  unemployment is low, labor force participation remains below pre-crisis levels, and real wage growth&#13;
  is subdued. In June 2014, the government announced a range of product and labor market reforms,&#13;
  broadly in line with OECD recommendations, and is expected to speed up their implementation&#13;
  after December 2014 elections. Growth in developing countries slipped to 4.4 percent in 2014. The&#13;
  slowdown in several large middle-income economies mainly reflects cyclical factors, domestic policy&#13;
  tightening, and political tensions. However, deeper, structural factors, including a trend slowdown&#13;
  in productivity, dampen growth prospects over the medium-term. Since the post-crisis rebound,&#13;
  output growth in the developing world has settled at a pace below that of the first decade of the&#13;
  2000s. A sharp decline in oil and other commodity prices and softening growth, partly due to tighter&#13;
  monetary policies, is helping reduce inflation pressures. In low-income countries, growth remained&#13;
  robust on the back of rising public investment, robust capital inflows, good harvests, and improving&#13;
  security in a few conflict countries (e.g., Myanmar, Central African Republic, Mali). The moderation&#13;
  in global food and energy prices in 2014 contributed to a decline in inflation which was particularly&#13;
  substantial in Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
&#13;
  Benign financing conditions through much of 2014 have allowed developing countries to continue&#13;
  to tap international bond markets at a record pace even though financial markets became more&#13;
  turbulent later in the year. As major central banks have expressed their commitment to maintain&#13;
  exceptionally accommodative policies to support activity, markets have tended to interpret negative&#13;
  news as a reason for further monetary policy accommodation. As a result, corrections in equity and&#13;
  high-yield bond markets, in response to several outbreaks of geopolitical conflict or disease epidemics,&#13;
  were quickly recouped. Expectations of increasingly divergent monetary policies across major central&#13;
  banks have also triggered a broad-based appreciation of the U.S. dollar and renewed pressure on some&#13;
  developing-country currencies. Central and Eastern European currencies, closely tied to the euro and&#13;
  affected by geopolitical turmoil in the region, have depreciated substantially against the U.S. dollar,&#13;
  though not against the euro. A number of commodity exporters, particularly Russia and those in&#13;
  Latin America, have also seen renewed exchange rate pressures, reflecting the combined impact of a&#13;
  broad-based dollar strengthening, softening commodity prices, and domestic uncertainties.&#13;

&#13;
  Box II. The Economic Impact of Weather-Related Shocks in SEE6&#13;
&#13;
  The SEE6 region has been exposed to a number of extreme weather events over the last three years,&#13;
  which have taken their toll on economic growth. In February 2012, SEE6 was hit hard by a severe&#13;
  winter, prompting a state of emergency in some countries. Countries in SEE6 experienced to&#13;
  different extents: water, food, fuel and medicine shortages, power and telecommunications outages,&#13;
  avalanches, and transportation system shutdowns. Economic output was reduced as construction&#13;
  slowed more than usual during the winter, employees were unable to get to work and consumers&#13;
  did not shop. This was followed by a drought in the summer of 2012. Hydro-power plants generate&#13;
  around 15 percent electricity in SEE6 and some countries are especially reliant on this electricity&#13;
  source. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in particular rely on hydro-power, which&#13;
  generates close to 100 percent of all electricity in Albania, around a third in Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
  and a half in Montenegro. The drought reduced electricity supply in an already energy-starved region,&#13;
  harming businesses and households. At the same time, the drought hit agricultural output in SEE6.&#13;
  Between them, the severe winter and summer drought helped to push SEE6 into a double-dip&#13;
  recession in 2012. Output in the region fell by 0.6 percent in 2012 and only Albania and Kosovo saw&#13;
  positive growth (SEE6 June 2013 edition of this report).&#13;

   In May 2014, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia were hit hard by floods. The rain was the heaviest&#13;
   since records began 120 years ago. A large share of the population and land mass were adversely&#13;
   impacted by the floods, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the latter, â&#128;&#156;[a]s of end-May 2014,&#13;
   25 people had died, about 90,000 people had been evacuated, and about 1 million or one-fourth of&#13;
   the total population had been directly affected by the floods. The affected area covered more than&#13;
   one-third of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s territory, and the massive floods have caused over 3,000 landslides.â&#128;&#157;6&#13;
&#13;
   A Recovery and Needs Assessment estimated that the cumulative impact could be sufficient to put&#13;
   Bosnia and Herzegovina back into recession and to significantly reduce output in Serbia, increase&#13;
   poverty, and put pressure on public finances. The floods are estimated to have caused the equivalent&#13;
   of nearly 15 percent of GDP in damages (9.3 percent of GDP) and losses (5.6 percent) in 2014 in&#13;
   Bosnia and Herzegovina.7 Reconstruction costs could put pressure on public finances of both countries&#13;
   and increase CAD as reconstruction materials are imported. Bosnia and Herzegovinian agricultural&#13;
   exports also suffered due to significant crop destruction. In Serbia, the floods are estimated to have&#13;
   caused around â&#130;¬864 million in damages and â&#130;¬648 million in losses. This translates into, respectively,&#13;
   2.7 percent of GDP in damages and 2 percent of GDP in losses in 2014. The hardest hit economic&#13;
   sectors were energy, mining, and agriculture but significant damages were also inflicted on transport&#13;
   infrastructure (roads, bridges and railways).&#13;
&#13;
   Bosnia and Herzegovina was hit by a second round of flooding in August 2014 and poor weather also&#13;
   harmed growth in Montenegro. Although it didnâ&#128;&#153;t reach anywhere near the destruction levels of the&#13;
   May floods, rain in September in Bosnia and Herzegovina was enough to cause alarm and serve as a&#13;
   further warning of the vulnerability of the region to climactic shocks. Low levels of rainfall combined&#13;
   with poor summer weather in Montenegro reduced electricity generation and exports, including&#13;
   tourism, thus reducing economic growth.&#13;
                                                                                                              continued to next page&#13;

However, exports remain low as a share of                       other SEE6 countries are around 30 percent&#13;
GDP in SEE6 and below potential. Exports                        below potential.8&#13;
averaged around 38 percent of GDP in 2013&#13;
in SEE6 countries. This compares with over&#13;
60 percent in EU11 countries. Kosovo and&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina perform particularly&#13;
badly, with exports at around 20 and 30 percent&#13;
of GDP, respectively. Recent analytical work&#13;
suggests the regionâ&#128;&#153;s exports are considerably&#13;
below potential, particularly to the worldâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
largest economic bloc on their doorstep, the&#13;
EU. Albanian exports to the EU are estimated&#13;
at 40 percent below potential, while those from&#13;

   Box III. Current Account Sustainability in the SEE6 Economies&#13;
&#13;
   Although there is not an absolute definition of current account sustainability, a countryâ&#128;&#153;s current&#13;
   account deficit (CAD) can be seen as sustainable as long as the ratio of foreign debt to GDP is&#13;
   not increasing and foreign investors are willing to finance it. The dominant approach to assessing&#13;
   current account sustainability in the literature is the intertemporal approach (Sachs 1981; Obsfeld&#13;
   and Rogoff 1994; Milesi-Ferretti and Razin 1996; IMF, 1998b; Carranza 2002), which suggests&#13;
   that current account balance is a consequence of forward-looking dynamic saving and investment&#13;
   decisions (Brissimis et al., 2010). Wu (2000) and Lau and Baharumshah (2005) operationalize this&#13;
   concept and suggest that a stationary current account to GDP ratio is consistent with an external&#13;
   debt to GDP ratio that never goes over certain limit and always reverts toward that limit. Wu (2000)&#13;
   finds a stationary current account to GDP ratio consistent with a finite external debt to GDP ratio&#13;
   for ten OECD countries. Lau and Baharumshah (2005) find a stationary current account to GDP&#13;
   ratio for three out of twelve Asian countries. Finding the ratio of current account to GDP to be&#13;
   either stationary or declining over time is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for current&#13;
   account sustainability. It is not sufficient since, many other factors have an effect on current account&#13;
   sustainability. In particular, a CAD to finance productive investment is not the same as one used&#13;
   to finance consumption and access to international financial markets matter. Still finding a ratio of&#13;
   current account to GDP that reverts back to a long-run level reduces the risk of a current account&#13;
   crisis. We test if the ratio of current account deficit to GDP is stationary for the SEE6. In estimating&#13;
   the rate of current account convergence to a steady state we follow the work of Jiandog and Shang-Jin&#13;
   (2007) and the economic literature on convergence calculation (Ball and Seridan, 2003; Hyvonen&#13;
   2004).&#13;
&#13;
   Following Wu (2000) and Lau and Baharumshah (2005), we investigate whether the persistent&#13;
   current account deficit in SEE6 countries is sustainable. We argue that countries with potentially&#13;
   high current account deficits will experience a current account deficit decrease just by returning to&#13;
                                                                                                                         continued to next page&#13;

   some underlying long-run cross-country mean rate. These deficits will tend to decrease if their size&#13;
   were a consequence of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s initial performance because of transitory factors and/or poor&#13;
   policy performance. This convergence may occur as a consequence of the policy to join the EU, since&#13;
   we assume that SEE6 countries are aware that EU accession with high current account deficits is not&#13;
   possible.&#13;
&#13;
   We test the sustainability of the CAD using two different methods. The first method is ordinary least&#13;
   squares and the second method is panel regression. The first method is applied to each countryâ&#128;&#153;s data&#13;
   individually. The second is applied to the SEE6 countries as a group. The estimation procedure is&#13;
   based on the following steps:&#13;
&#13;
   1. First we calculate Xt which represents each countryâ&#128;&#153;s current account (ca) as a share of its GDP&#13;
   (gdp) in period (t):&#13;
&#13;
   Xt = cat / gdpt	(1)&#13;
&#13;
   where t indexes the years from 2002 to 2013.&#13;
&#13;
   2. Second we test if Xt follows a unit root process by estimating:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#136;&#134;Xt = Î± + Î² Xt-1 + et	(2)&#13;
&#13;
   If Î² = 1 in equation (2), convergence is precluded by definition since the current account deficit&#13;
   would always be growing12. However, if beta is less than 1, then that is consistent with the current&#13;
   account converging toward a steady state. The closer the speed of convergence is to one in absolute&#13;
   value, the faster the speed of convergence.&#13;
&#13;
   The results suggest that the SEE6 taken together has a long-run steady state CAD of 9.8 percent&#13;
   of GDP and that it will converge toward this level, whether it is higher or lower than this in any&#13;
   given year (Table BIII.1). The CAD converges toward its long-run steady state at a rate of around&#13;
   38 percent per year.&#13;

   The data also allow us to model this separately for Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia and&#13;
   Serbia13. These countries have steady state CADs of 14, 7.9 and 14.1 percent respectively (Table&#13;
   BIII.2). Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia and Serbia all exhibit faster convergence tendencies&#13;
   than the SEE6 average however, with â&#128;&#156;speedsâ&#128;&#157; of 77, 64 and 78 percent per year, respectively.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   The estimated long-run steady state CAD does not seem likely to be sustainable over the medium to&#13;
   long term. The estimation suggests that each country in the SEE6 exhibits a long-run CAD that is&#13;
   far above the maximum of 5 percent of current account deficit to GDP ratio, which in vulnerability&#13;
   diagnostics is sometimes considered sustainable. Persistent current account deficits above 5% of GDP&#13;
   have generally been considered unsustainable in the long run, especially when the deficit is financed&#13;
   with short-term debt and decreases in foreign reserves (Milesi-Ferretti and Razin, 1996, Carranza&#13;
   2002). In addition, the financing structure of the CAD should be considered. The long-run steady&#13;
   state rate for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia is much higher than for other SEE6 countries. This&#13;
   estimation also provides a warning of a potentially unsustainable current account deficit in these&#13;
   countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13	 We applied panel unit root test to address the problem of the low power of standard unit roots tests. The results of panel unit root test suggest that&#13;
    we do reject the Ho of a common unit root process but we could not reject the Ho of an individual unit root process. This means that we had to&#13;
    test which of the SEE6 countries are suitable for this approach.&#13;

Still, this monetary stimulus did not&#13;
accelerate credit growth, as low credit&#13;
demand and portfolio quality concerns&#13;
remained prevalent. To increase credit&#13;
support to the corporate sector and lower its&#13;
cost of borrowing, the National Bank of Serbia&#13;
(NBS) unlocked a part of the banksâ&#128;&#153; credit&#13;
potential by reducing foreign exchange reserve&#13;
requirement ratios by 1 percentage point in&#13;
November and by the same amount again in&#13;
December (to 27 percent and 20 percent,&#13;
depending on maturities). At the same time,&#13;
the NBS raised the domestic currency share of&#13;
foreign exchange required reserve allocations&#13;
by 2 percentage points in November and&#13;
additional 2 percentage points in December&#13;
(from 32 percent and 24 percent to 36 percent&#13;
and 28 percent), aiming to encourage banks to&#13;
rely more on long-term and dinar sources of&#13;
funding.&#13;

   Box IV. Financing the SEE6 Banking System&#13;
&#13;
   The pre-crisis banking model in SEE6 relied on a large foreign bank presence and high dependence&#13;
   on parent bank funding (except in FYR Macedonia). While financial sector development differed&#13;
   across SEE6 countries in the pre-crisis period of 2003â&#128;&#147;2008, some common trends can be identified&#13;
   including continued financial sector deepening and consolidation of the banking sectors as well as a&#13;
   shift towards privately-owned banking sectors with increased foreign ownership. Fueled by a benign&#13;
   global environment and ample lending supported by foreign parent banksâ&#128;&#153; funding and capital in&#13;
   subsidiaries, credit to the private sector grew at rates exceeding 30 percent between 2003 and 2005. As&#13;
   a consequence, banksâ&#128;&#153; loan-to-deposit ratios peaked at 120â&#128;&#147;170 percent in Bosnia and Herzegovina,&#13;
   Montenegro and Serbia.&#13;
&#13;
   The associated vulnerabilities of this model became clear during the global financial crisis when&#13;
   capital inflows came to a halt. As a result of the crisis, capital flows to SEE6 countries reversed and&#13;
   banksâ&#128;&#153; financing constraints became apparent, jeopardizing macro-financial stability. Between end-&#13;
   2008 and 2013, BIS-reporting banks reduced their cross-border exposure in the SEE6 financial sector&#13;
   by 2.8 percent of GDP. However, a traditional banking sector model, absence of riskier instruments&#13;
   as well as the launch of the Vienna Initiative, which aimed inter alia to prevent large-scale capital&#13;
   withdrawals from Eastern Europe and to ensure Eastern European subsidiary banks were sufficiently&#13;
   well capitalized, helped the financial systems in the region to weather the global crisis relatively well.&#13;
&#13;
   Post crisis trends suggest a shift in funding structures for SEE6 banks toward domestic deposit&#13;
   mobilization. Domestic deposits grew at an average of 9 percent of GDP between end 2008 and&#13;
   end 2013 (Table IV.1). This shift is also reflected in the average loan-to-deposit ratio continuing its&#13;
   generally moderate downward movement, now at around 98 percent. However, as foreign banks&#13;
   still own an average of 87 percent of banking sector assets, the SEE6 financial systems remain&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                       continued to next page&#13;

   Further financial stability challenges stem from deteriorating asset quality and a large stock of foreign&#13;
   exchange lending. NPLs increased more than three-fold, from an average of 5 percent in the pre-&#13;
   crises period to 16.7 percent in the first half of 2014. In Albania, BiH and Serbia foreign currency&#13;
   lending amounted to between 50 and 70 percent of total lending by mid- 2014.19&#13;

&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 EU Financial Architecture. The ECBâ&#128;&#153;s recently published asset quality reviews and stress testsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
      which formed the entry point into the Single Supervisory Mechanism for systemically important&#13;
      banks in the Eurozoneâ&#128;&#148;have created pressures for some of the parent banks from Greece and&#13;
      Slovenia to shrink their balance sheets, or to reduce the amount of capital held in subsidiaries.20&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Policies for Reduction of Cross-Border Exposures. Moreover, some parent banks from Greece&#13;
      Austria and Slovenia face regulatory pressures from the European Commission to downsize and&#13;
      potentially withdraw from SEE6.21 At the same time, host regulators have encouraged parent&#13;
                                                                                                                                continued to next page&#13;

21	 Sloveniaâ&#128;&#153;s NLB recently reached a recapitalization and restructuring plan with the European Commission (EC), which includes downsizing its&#13;
    portfolio, and raising the risk of divestment from the region. Greek authorities have also instructed their banks to gradually withdraw from the&#13;
    region. Hypo Bank was nationalized in Austria in 2009, and is waiting to be bought out as foreseen in the EC restructuring plan.&#13;

         bank groups to put in place more stringent limits on the funding credit lines of their SEE6&#13;
         subsidiaries.22&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Global regulatory reforms. Basel III introduces new regulatory frameworks for capital and liquidity&#13;
      as well as capital surcharges for global systemically important financial institutions affecting the&#13;
      SEE6 region if implementation is â&#128;&#152;frontloadedâ&#128;&#153; by host countries.21&#13;
&#13;
   Fostering an orderly deleveraging process as well as rebalancing of the existing funding models is crucial&#13;
   for further financial sector development and economic growth in the region. Measures could focus&#13;
   on recalibrating banksâ&#128;&#153; business models, promoting savings mobilization through macroeconomic&#13;
   policies and developing regional capital markets. Underperforming bank profitability compared&#13;
   to pre-crisis levels as well as pockets of vulnerabilities among individual banks require continued&#13;
   focus on implementing bank recovery and resolution regimes. Building on the achievements of the&#13;
   Vienna Initiative, SEE6 countries should work to further strengthen cooperation with home country&#13;
   supervisory authorities to ensure ongoing financial stability as banking supervisors require more&#13;
   information about the risk profiles of parent banks and banking groups.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   Box V: Potential Effects of the Ukraine Crisis on the SEE6 Economies&#13;
&#13;
   Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s annexation of Crimea in February 2014 triggered a political and economic crisis in Ukraine,&#13;
   with its GDP expected to contract by 8 percent and the consolidated fiscal deficit25 projected at&#13;
   10.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The events raised strong reactions across the world. The U.S. and EU&#13;
   imposed sanctions, which, coupled with the overall uncertainty about the geopolitical developments,&#13;
   low oil prices and persistent structural weaknesses, brought the Russian economy to stagnation&#13;
   with the projected growth remaining at 0.4 percent in the medium term. The SEE6 economies are&#13;
   vulnerable to the effects of the crisis due to their strong ties with the EU and Russia.&#13;
&#13;
   Natural gas consumption is significant in two of the SEE6 countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and&#13;
   Serbia, which import most of their natural gas from Russia through Ukraine. The possibility of&#13;
   a disruption of gas imports is a significant threat to energy security in these countries. Domestic&#13;
   natural gas production and storage capacities are limited in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, such&#13;
   a disruption is likely to have a larger effect on its economy than in Serbia, where domestic production&#13;
   and existing stocks can cover as much as half of Serbiaâ&#128;&#153;s annual natural gas consumption. A European&#13;
   Commission report finds that in the event of a disruption of gas imports from Russia, the availability&#13;
   of gas in Bosnia and Herzegovina can decline by as much as 80â&#128;&#147;100 percent in the matter of a few&#13;
   weeks at most. In Serbia, gas consumption is projected to remain unaffected for the first five months.&#13;
   Demand-side measures can reduce the effects; however, the absence of a complete market mechanism&#13;
   for gas distribution and technical inefficiencies in the distribution network are likely to make their&#13;
   implementation difficult.&#13;
&#13;
   The effects of the sanctions imposed against Russia can also permeate through the SEE6 countries.&#13;
   Montenegroâ&#128;&#153;s aluminum trade with the Russian CEAC group was already suspended in 2013. There&#13;
   are between 5,000 and 7,000 Russians permanent residents in Montenegro. Russian citizens owned&#13;
   32 percent of foreign companies in Montenegro in 2012. The flow of funds between Montenegro and&#13;
   Russia can be affected directly from the sanctions or through their effects on the Russian economic&#13;
   growth. A continued slowdown in Russia is likely to reduce also Montenegroâ&#128;&#153;s tourism exports. In the&#13;
   first ten months of 2014, around 21 percent of all tourist arrivals and 27 percent of tourist overnight&#13;
   stays were from Russia.&#13;
                                                                                             continued to next page&#13;

  The SEE6 growth is also vulnerable to some second-order effects. For instance, the economies&#13;
  of Albania, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, and Montenegro do not depend at all or significantly on&#13;
  consumption of natural gas. However, a disruption of natural gas supplies is likely to increase the&#13;
  regional demand for electricity, which would have implications on the domestic electricity and food&#13;
  prices. Moreover, the SEE6 economies are highly dependent on the EU markets as the EU is the&#13;
  main destination for the SEE6 goods and services exports. The EU imports 53 percent of its energy&#13;
  consumption and 66 percent of its natural gas. Around a quarter of EU gas consumption is imported&#13;
  from Russia and half of these imports are through Ukraine. A disruption of the Russian gas exports&#13;
  to the EU would particularly affect the Eastern Europe and the Baltics, and in turn the SEE6 through&#13;
  reduced external demand.&#13;
&#13;
  Overall, a prolonged crisis in Ukraine is projected to reduce the SEE6 growth in 2015 from 1.9 percent&#13;
  to 1.8 percent.&#13;
&#13;
  Note: The European Commission published the results of the stress test conducted to test the&#13;
  implications of the disruptions in the natural gas imports from Russia on the European energy&#13;
  security in October 2014. The test covers the EU countries, SEE6, Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia.&#13;

  Four of the SEE6 countries are currently candidates for EU accession with only one of them in&#13;
  active accession negotiations. Montenegro was granted the EU candidate status in October 2010&#13;
  and accession negotiations were opened in June 2012. The EU screening process in Montenegro&#13;
  was completed in May 2014. In the negotiation process so far, two chapters have been provisionally&#13;
  closed and sixteen chapters have been opened. Serbia became a candidate country in March 2012.&#13;
  The European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Serbia in June 2013, and held the&#13;
  1st Intergovernmental Conference with Serbia in January 2014. By end-2014, 26 out of 35 chapters&#13;
  were screened, but none chapters were opened for negotiations yet due to lack of progress on the&#13;
  â&#128;&#156;Brussels agreementâ&#128;&#157; between Serbia and Kosovo. FYR Macedonia has been a candidate since&#13;
  December 2005. Even though the Commission has recommended on several occasions the opening&#13;
  of accession negotiations since October 2009, the recommendation has not yet been endorsed by&#13;
  the European Council and negotiations postponed. Albania gained the EU candidate status in June&#13;
  2014.&#13;

  Two of the SEE6 countries are with a potential EU candidate status. Upon commitment to a reform&#13;
  agenda, the EU may also activate its SAA with Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2015. In July 2014, the&#13;
  EU and Kosovo chief negotiators initiated the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the&#13;

assessment estimates the impact on growth&#13;

climate action across sectors and provides&#13;
advice on priorities for public investment.&#13;
A dynamic general equilibrium model with&#13;
detailed sectors simulated green scenarios&#13;
against the baseline. Adaptation (and also&#13;
mitigation) options were integrated into&#13;
the model to allow analysis of the growth,&#13;
employment, and fiscal implications of different&#13;
combinations of green growth actions. Advice&#13;
on public investment priorities emerges from&#13;
the assessment. Climate investments pose costs&#13;
upfront but provide benefits both now and&#13;
later. Adaptation interventions (which protect&#13;
tomorrowâ&#128;&#153;s output from climate damage) are&#13;
found to impose little costs in growth and&#13;
employment in the short-term once sector&#13;
results are integrated into a general equilibrium&#13;
model. Under a â&#128;&#152;greenâ&#128;&#153; climate action scenario,&#13;
moderate adaptation measures in agriculture&#13;

climate-proofing of physical infrastructure&#13;

Albania and Serbia what would happen to the&#13;
demographic structure of the population in&#13;
the source countries if emigrants to OECD&#13;
economies returned to their respective home&#13;
countries. Assuming that an individualâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
education decision is independent of the&#13;
subsequent migration decision, the graphs&#13;
illustrate the population structure by gender,&#13;
broad age group and education, under the&#13;
hypothetical assumption of no emigration&#13;
in the past decades. Both countries appear&#13;
to have lost more men to emigration than&#13;
females, and the men who emigrated tend be&#13;
better educated than females. The Albanian&#13;
population would be considerably higher in&#13;

            Coping with Floods, Strengthening
            Growth, from the South East Europe Regular Economic Report
            explains that South East Europe&#146;s (SEE6)&#146;s economy is
            estimated to have stagnated in 2014 on the back of
            flood-induced contraction in Serbia and a sharp slowdown in
            Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The regional economy
            grew 0.2 percent in 2014, insufficient to improve living
            standards or to make a dent in the region&#146;s high
            unemployment rate. External demand for SEE6 exports was a
            key positive contributor to economic growth in 2014 as the
            region&#146;s exports gained market share, despite the weak
            Eurozone performance and disappointing global recovery.
            Domestic demand remained subdued because of delayed or
            reduced public and private investments and weak consumption.
            Devastating floods in large parts of the region further
            weighed on the SEE6 economic activity in 2014. The weak
            regional economic performance masks notable differences
            among the SEE6 countries. In 2014, the Serbian economy is
            estimated to have contracted by 2 percent for a third time
            since the global crisis and Bosnia and Herzegovina is
            stagnating. Economic growth rates in Kosovo and Montenegro
            are estimated to have moderated in 2014. Only Albania and
            FYR Macedonia showed signs of a more sustained recovery on
            the back of increasing exports, particularly in the second
            half of the year. The floods were the main culprit behind
            the weak domestic demand and the overall sluggish economic
            performance in SEE6. Robust exports only partially offset
            the SEE6&#146;s weak domestic demand, leaving external imbalances
            in vulnerability. The average fiscal deficit in SEE6 is
            estimated to have increased by 0.4 percent of GDP to 4.2
            percent in 2014 due to faster growth in expenditures than
            revenues. The SEE6 region as a whole is projected to grow
            1.3 percent in 2015, supported by a slowly recovering
            external demand, especially in Europe, and stabilization of
            international energy prices at around current levels.
