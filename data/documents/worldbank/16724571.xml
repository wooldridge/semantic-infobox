Supporting a New Community of Practice&#13;
Sanitation marketing is an emerging field with a relatively&#13;
small group of practitioners who are learning by doing. With&#13;
an Introductory Guide to Sanitation Marketing, the Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) seeks to contribute to the field by&#13;
sharing practical guidance on the design, implementation,&#13;
and monitoring of rural sanitation marketing programs at&#13;
scale in India, Indonesia, and Tanzania, plus additional proj-&#13;
ects implemented in Cambodia and Peru.&#13;
&#13;
As a new community of practice, our goal is to capture and               in sanitation marketing and help them adapt the vari-&#13;

  How the behavior is modified or adopted depends on the application of&#13;
  what is known as the marketing mix, including product, place, price, and                        Keep in Mind&#13;
  promotion. The marketing mix is also known as the Four Ps. The Four Ps                          Sanitation marketing can be applied&#13;
  are at the core of any sanitation marketing initiative. Although a sanita-                      for much more than increasing cov-&#13;
  tion marketing program might not have complete control over the Four                            erage of improved sanitation. It can&#13;
  Ps, it tries to influence them.                                                                 support a wide range of behaviors&#13;
                                                                                                  including ceasing to defecate in the&#13;
  Because social marketing initiatives aim to benefit society rather than                         open, cleaning and maintaining the&#13;
  achieve a profit, they are usually led by government agencies, NGOs, and                        facilities, improving management of&#13;
  the nonprofit sector. However, these initiatives often rely on the private                      childrenâ&#128;&#153;s feces, and washing hands&#13;
  sector to provide products and services to support that change in a sus-                        with soap after toilet use.&#13;
  tainable manner, such as the production and distribution of condoms to&#13;
  prevent HIV/AIDS, improved cook stoves to decrease Acute Respiratory&#13;
  Infections (ARI), and water treatment products and devices to reduce the&#13;
  incidence of diarrheal episodes.&#13;
&#13;
  Having an understanding around social marketing is a good first step to&#13;
  understanding sanitation marketingâ&#128;&#148;but commercial factors are criti-&#13;
  cal to consider. Recognizing that supply chains, distribution centers, and&#13;
  small-scale sanitation entrepreneurs are necessary to ensure sustainable ac-&#13;
  cess to improved sanitation facilities and services, our working definition&#13;
  of sanitation marketing promotes a broader idea of what sanitation&#13;
  marketing entails, and how to apply it at scale:&#13;
&#13;
           Sanitation marketing is the application of the best social and&#13;
           commercial marketing practices to change behavior and to&#13;
           scale up the demand and supply for improved sanitation, par-&#13;
           ticularly among the poor.&#13;

      BOX 1: QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH METHODS&#13;
&#13;
      Qualitative research uses methods aimed at gaining an in-depth understanding of a given situation, behavior, at-&#13;
      titude, belief, or other behavioral determinant. Common methods include:&#13;
&#13;
           â&#128;¢ Focus group discussions (FGD), usually conducted with a small group of participants who share one or&#13;
             more characteristics of interest such as age group, gender, or sanitation status. A moderator leads the&#13;
             group through a series of topics. Researchers can use techniques such as pocket-voting (a technique for&#13;
             encouraging participants to express a preference among options in a private way) to probe sensitive top-&#13;
             ics such as open defecation. They can use projective techniques (for example, what would this imaginary&#13;
             family in your community do in this situation?) and diagnostic role plays, in which participants try to show&#13;
             â&#128;&#156;typicalâ&#128;? community behavior, to understand social norms and stimulate group discussion. Sessions can&#13;
             be audio- or videotaped with participantsâ&#128;&#153; consent.&#13;
           â&#128;¢ In-depth interviews (IDI), conducted with key informants, stakeholders, and members of the target popula-&#13;
             tions (such as suppliers or households) to probe certain areas and obtain information that is too sensitive&#13;
             (for example, anal cleansing), complex, or detailed to share in a focus group session or when there is no&#13;
             benefit in having participants interact.&#13;
           â&#128;¢ Informal assessments, which can provide a big-picture view of topics such as the supply chain and the&#13;
             range of sanitation products and services. This technique can also be used to identify providers who have&#13;
             overcome barriers and developed a business model that is worth replicating in whole or in part as part of&#13;
             capacity building. Assessments can include key informant interviews and pictures of products and suppli-&#13;
             ers found in the marketplace. Note that informal assessments are more challenging for at-scale projects.&#13;
           â&#128;¢ Non-participative observations of houses, facilities, and community spaces, which can reveal sanitation&#13;
             and hygiene practices.&#13;
&#13;
      Quantitative research targets a larger representative sample of the population, using a structured and standard-&#13;
      ized research instrument. Interviews can take place in ï¬?xed settings such as the household or the workplace (in&#13;
      the case of suppliers) or in settings such as marketplaces (using intercept surveys). Sample size and sampling&#13;
      method will determine whether the survey ï¬?ndings are representative and can be generalized to the wider popula-&#13;
      tion. If well-designed, quantitative formative research can also provide a baseline for monitoring and evaluation.&#13;

       BOX 2: REVIEWING A QUESTIONNAIRE&#13;
&#13;
            â&#128;¢ Develop a two-column table. In one column, list the indicators from the results framework as well as other&#13;
              research questions. In the second column, list the question numbers from the questionnaire that correspond&#13;
              to the indicators. This pinpoints extraneous questions and identifies indicators that remain unaddressed.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ Use existing questions from available national questionnaires. Not only have these questions been tested,&#13;
              they offer a quick way to externally validate the survey.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ Ask colleagues to review the questionnaire on the basis of the research protocol. Weigh comments against&#13;
              the study objectives.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ Flag problems or issues and address with the research consultant. Do not rewrite or craft questions unless&#13;
              you have research experience.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ Review possible response categories for close-ended questions to ensure that the mostly commonly ex-&#13;
              pected responses are included.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ Check for sufficient filters (for example, to filter out respondents whose answers are not of interest in a&#13;
              particular question) and functional skips.&#13;
            â&#128;¢ Review focus group discussion guidelines to ensure that questions include sufficient probing and are for-&#13;
              mulated to elicit more than simple â&#128;&#156;yesâ&#128;? or â&#128;&#156;noâ&#128;? responses.&#13;

  (Box 2 gives some tips on reviewing the questionnaire).                                                  address these issues?&#13;
  After pretesting, the firm reports back to the team on the&#13;
  results.                                                                                         The research firm typically produces a fieldwork report at&#13;

  It is also important to clarify what the top-line results&#13;
  should include. It is best to clarify this before finalizing the                                 Once the data is entered and cleaned, the research firm will per-&#13;

      It is standard practice in surveys to skip over some questions to filter out interviewees for whom these questions are not relevant or appropriate. Pretesting helps ensure that&#13;

      BOX 3: INNOVATION AT WORK: WSP, IDE, AND IDEO TEAM UP TO DEVELOP THE EASY LATRINE&#13;
&#13;
      In Cambodia, research findings suggested that most house-&#13;
      holds aspire to a pour-flush toilet but cannot afford one. WSP,&#13;
      international NGO IDE, and design firm IDEO teamed up to&#13;
      develop an affordable and simple â&#128;&#156;latrine coreâ&#128;? that would&#13;
      confer the benefits of a pour-flush but cost less than half the&#13;
      normal cost due to smarter use of materials, an improved&#13;
      production method, and a streamlined design.&#13;
&#13;
      Branded the Easy Latrine, the toilet is available through local&#13;
      producers who are trained in sanitation and hygiene education,&#13;
                                                                                            Easy la&#13;

      ience. A customer goes to the supplier, pays, and has the toilet&#13;
      home-delivered. In the past, buying a latrine involved engaging&#13;
      a mason (to build the â&#128;&#156;boxâ&#128;? surrounding the slab, which in the Easy Latrine is a prefab reinforced concrete product),&#13;
      visiting a culvert seller to buy the rings to line the pit plus a pit cover, and visiting a waterpipe shop to buy the pipe to&#13;
      connect the slab to the offset pit.&#13;

      Branding can be used on a wide                    efits and aspirations instead of its features or technology options. Branding allows&#13;

                                                        Innovation. Innovation might be needed if research shows that locally available prod-&#13;

  Key Principles&#13;
  Target market. Practically speaking, sanitation marketing targets the poorest&#13;
  segments of a population given that the commercial sector serves the middle&#13;
  and upper classes. However, there is debate within the WSS sector as to how to&#13;
  best serve the poorest (lowest) quintile.35 Targeted or smart subsidies can play&#13;
  a role as long as they do not impede the development of a sustainable mar-&#13;
  ketplace through sanitation marketing approaches. The promotion of Sangura&#13;
  slabs, which are sold at around US$5 through the Choo Bora program in rural&#13;
  Tanzania, is an example of marketing an affordable option that enables low-                                                Keep in Mind&#13;
  income households to retrofit and upgrade simple pit latrines.                                                             Understand the difference&#13;
                                                                                                                             between affordability, availability&#13;
  Affordability versus availability of cash. It is important to distinguish between                                          of cash, and willingness to pay.&#13;
  affordability and availability of cash. For example, a rural household in East Java                                        Interpret willingness to pay&#13;
  might not have the liquidity at any time of the year to buy their ideal toilet (pour-                                      results with caution: a&#13;
  flush with septic tank), but they might still consider it affordable.                                                      householdâ&#128;&#153;s willingness to pay&#13;
                                                                                                                             can shift as individuals gain&#13;
  Willingness to pay. A qualitative study in Cambodia36 asked respondents                                                    awareness or knowledge of&#13;
  whether, if their â&#128;&#156;idealâ&#128;? latrine was on sale for US$100, they would be able and                                           options or prices. Similarly, a&#13;
  willing to buy it. Most said they would be willing to pay for this latrine but they                                        household might consider a&#13;
  would first need time to save. Many respondents felt they would purchase this                                              product affordable, yet not have&#13;
  latrine within three to six months. Several stated that they would not purchase                                            the cash liquidity to purchase it.&#13;
  this latrine at all if they did not have enough money. Note that willingness to pay&#13;
  results should be interpreted with caution: willingness to pay can shift as people&#13;
  gain awareness or knowledge of options or prices during the buying process.&#13;
&#13;
  Challenges&#13;
  Lack of control. Price control is beyond the reach of a sanitation marketing&#13;
  program. Because suppliers tend to look at unit margins or prices, keeping prices&#13;
  within reach of lower income quintiles is a potential challenge.&#13;

&#13;
  Repositioning lower-end options to be more aspirational can be successful if&#13;
  lower-cost models respond to the benefits sought at that price level. This can&#13;
  be achieved through promotion.&#13;
&#13;
  Conduct advocacy if non-market impediments are creating upward pressures&#13;
  on prices. If the supply chain and enabling environment analysis shows that the&#13;
  high price of materials is due to high import tariffs or other factors, advocacy can&#13;
  lessen or remove these impediments. Savings can be passed on to households,&#13;

  Building capacity to buy sanitation products in bulk can reduce unit costs.                                                Smart subsidies may have a role.&#13;
  This has been done in India where purchases are pooled at the Gram Panchayat                                               The challenge is to develop them&#13;
  (district) level to purchase pans.                                                                                         in a way that they effectively&#13;

                                                                                                                             while not hampering market-&#13;

  sidies to reach the poorest segments (for example, through the use of vouchers&#13;
  or behavioral outcomes) and can provide a useful model. The challenge is often&#13;
  to ensure that the subsidies reach those who are being targeted. Untargeted or&#13;
  supply-driven subsidies can potentially undermine market-based approaches.&#13;
&#13;
  3.4 Marketing Mix: Place&#13;
  Key Principles&#13;
  Points of sale must be easily accessible to customers. Front-line providers (sup-&#13;
  pliers that households go to early in the buying process) should be conveniently&#13;
  located and easily accessible. In Peru, WSP has worked with hardware stores as&#13;
  front-line providers for households interested in sanitation products (See Box 4).&#13;
&#13;
  Providers need to know how to build and offer safe sanitation products and&#13;
  services (including proper sludge disposal). They must also know how to&#13;
  maintain inventory and perform other basic business tasks. This training is stan-&#13;
  dard practice in sanitation marketing efforts to date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      BOX 4: SANI-CENTRES IN NIGERIA&#13;
&#13;
      In Nigeria, WaterAid has promoted the establishment of a sani-centre in each project community to tackle transpor-&#13;
      tation and market-access challenges faced by remote populations. WaterAid trains several community members as&#13;
      artisans to construct low-cost slabs and provides each community with seed money to build 20 to 30 slabs in each&#13;
      community. The goods supplied to each sani-centre are designated to be sold to community members at affordable&#13;
      prices, and any income generated used to replenish the stock of raw materials. However, evidence from the study to&#13;
      date suggests that the sani-centres are not effectively reaching the poor in these communities.&#13;

           â&#128;¢ Avoid overly technical training content and emphasize practical information and skill-building. A field&#13;
             practicum is a good way to accomplish this.&#13;
           â&#128;¢ Focus training on product options that will be promoted through the demand creation efforts or that are&#13;
             commonly offered.&#13;
           â&#128;¢ Establish or integrate linkages with the sanitation marketing intervention (such as by using brand names&#13;
             or product catalogs).&#13;
           â&#128;¢ Be clear on participant eligibility selection criteria so that those chosen are more likely to be able to apply&#13;
             newly learned skills.&#13;
           â&#128;¢ Identify quality-assurance strategy during the development of the accreditation program (for example, how long&#13;
             accreditation will be good for, presence of national standards, clearly assigned responsibilities for monitoring&#13;
             these standards, renewal conditions, and whether and under what conditions accreditation can be revoked).&#13;

  sanitation businesses. Through standardization of product range and quality,&#13;
  franchising offers potential economies of scale in promotion and training. WSP&#13;
  is testing elements of the franchising model in East Java, where efforts to replicate&#13;
  promising aspects of Sumadiâ&#128;&#153;s business model (notably linkages to microfinance&#13;
  institutions and informal savings groups, supply chain management, and the offer-&#13;
  ing of standardized modular products) are underway with sixteen other small busi-&#13;
  nesses. Franchising has challenges, including the need for an appropriate franchisor&#13;
  who can manage the franchisees. A recent study suggests that franchising has not&#13;
  yet proven itself as an effective way of reaching the poorest segments of the popu-&#13;
  lation.41 However, variations on the franchising model such as micro-franchising,&#13;
  which aims to impact poverty by facilitating job creation and sale of products and&#13;
  services to the base of the pyramid may have promise.42 Moreover, additional data&#13;

      BOX 7: MARKETING STRATEGY IN TANZANIA&#13;
&#13;
       Campaign platform The campaign targets rural heads of household and their families. Formative research re-&#13;
                         vealed that the campaign needed to propose that good sanitation can be easily achieved&#13;
                         and is not just for the wealthy, as many assumed. In addition, sanitation improvements&#13;
                         needed to be linked with improvements in status, convenience, and safetyâ&#128;&#148;especially for&#13;
                         children. This led to the development of a marketing campaign, Choo Bora Chawezekana!&#13;
                         Tumeamua Maendeleo Hadi Chooni (roughly â&#128;&#156;A Good Toilet Is Possible! Weâ&#128;&#153;ve Taken Our&#13;
                         Development All the Way into the Latrineâ&#128;?). Representatives of the target audience found&#13;
                         the Swahili version to be nuanced and humorous while linking the desire to improve oneâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                         life to sanitation. Choo Bora messaging is integrated into all aspects of the intervention and&#13;
                         the target audience encounters it through several junctures, including masons, community&#13;
                         sanitation committees, mass media (radio), and Direct Consumer Contact (DCC).&#13;
       Product                      Households are encouraged to make various upgrades with special attention on the&#13;
                                    Sungura slab. This 2-foot-by-2 foot concrete slab is a consumer favorite. It is smooth,&#13;
                                    washable, and safe for children; it has a drop hole in the middle; with a concrete cover&#13;
                                    that seals the hole, effectively containing the feces; and has raised footrests to ensure&#13;
                                    good aim, especially at night. The slab is especially useful for upgrading existing la-&#13;
                                    trines, which is what most rural Tanzanian households need to do to realize the health&#13;
                                    and economic beneï¬?ts of sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Price                        A Sungura slab is approximately US$5 to purchase and US$4 to produce. In some&#13;
                                    areas, US$5 will include installation; in others, customers have to pay about US$1 extra.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Place                        Because villages in Tanzania are separated by large distances, transportation is a major&#13;
                                    constraint. Sanitation goods and services are not readily or widely available. WSP&#13;
                                    trained approximately 470 masons residing in or around priority villages to produce and&#13;
                                    sell Sungura slabs. Masons purchase raw materials and manufacture them on-site near&#13;
                                    village centers, sometimes using makeshift workshops. Orders are taken directly from&#13;
                                    households. Access to capital is a continuing issue for masons who often cannot buy in&#13;
                                    bulk on their own. Masons often rely on the district government to lend them the molds&#13;
                                    needed for manufacturing.&#13;
       Promotion                    â&#128;¢ Mass media. Produce was soap opera; five 15-minute episodes airing twice a week&#13;
                                      before the evening news on TBC Taifa (AM and FM frequencies); show is supported&#13;

                                      through CLTS triggering in which the community decides how and when to improve&#13;
                                      their sanitation facilities; carried out by district or ward facilitators with coaching&#13;
                                      from resource agencies; â&#128;&#156;unbrandedâ&#128;? and not explicitly linked to the Choo Bora&#13;
                                      campaign.&#13;
                                    â&#128;¢ Sanitation committees and masons. Once the community triggers and establishes an&#13;
                                      action plan, a mason can begin promoting upgrades; a sanitation committee is formed&#13;
                                      to perform day-to-day promotion and monitoring.&#13;

                                                        Within each channel there are a range of options to consider. Print materials are&#13;
                                                        often appropriate for health workers, trained volunteers, and policymakers. Low-&#13;
                                                        literary materials relying heavily on illustrations can provide useful reminders and&#13;
                                                        reinforce messages conveyed through interpersonal communication or DCC. For&#13;
                                                        example, counseling cards have pictures on the front to illustrate recommenda-&#13;

                                                        and the families. These can also include suggestions for how to negotiate small&#13;
                                                        improvements in sanitation practices; another option is community theater,&#13;
                                                        which can be used to model desired behaviors and address common barriers to&#13;

                                                        With all options, effectiveness rests on conveying key messages and issues and on&#13;

           â&#156;&#148; A creative brief sets out the plan for the communication       contact report&#13;
             campaign and serves as a reference document for both the       creative brief&#13;
             program manager and the ad agency.                             entertainment-education&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; The creative brief should summarize the campaignâ&#128;&#153;s purpose&#13;
             and objectives, describe the problem using supporting data,&#13;
             and identify the target audience.&#13;

             tested with the target audience, and the campaign strategies   attractiveness&#13;

   â&#128;¢ Agency objective: This summarizes the overall purpose          The brief should also specify considerations such as tone&#13;

      BOX 9: EXTRACT FROM CREATIVE BRIEF FOR A RADIO SOAP OPERA TO IMPROVE SANITATION&#13;
&#13;
      Agency Objectiveâ&#128;&#148;Develop and produce five 15-minute episodes of a radio soap opera to encourage improved&#13;
      sanitation in rural areas of ten districts of Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
      Behavioral Objectiveâ&#128;&#148;Contribute to establishing continuous household improvement of the place of defecation.&#13;
&#13;
      Communication Objectivesâ&#128;&#148;Achieve the following based on the insights from formative research and work-&#13;
      shops. The behavioral determinant targeted, based on the SaniFOAM framework, is indicated in parentheses.&#13;
      After the campaign, the target audience will:&#13;
          â&#128;¢ Understand that the true purpose of a toilet is to avoid contact of feces with people (Knowledge)&#13;
          â&#128;¢ Know that adding a simple inexpensive slab (Sungura) to your toilet can improve your communityâ&#128;&#153;s and&#13;
             familyâ&#128;&#153;s health (Knowledge)&#13;
          â&#128;¢ Believe that having a good toilet is possible (Belief)&#13;
          â&#128;¢ Know that all feces, even childrenâ&#128;&#153;s, are harmful to others and to the environment (Knowledge and Social&#13;
             Support)&#13;
          â&#128;¢ Know that it is no longer acceptable to have a basic latrine (Social Norms)&#13;
          â&#128;¢ Speak to a mason for more information (Intention)&#13;
          â&#128;¢ Re-examine their priorities for expenditures (Competing Priorities)&#13;
          â&#128;¢ Remember to wash hands with soap after using a latrine&#13;
&#13;
      Measurements for Success&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Thorough pretesting, including comprehension, attraction, persuasion, identification, and acceptability&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Number of audience members reached by the soap opera&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Level of exposure and retention measured through periodic surveys&#13;
&#13;
      Mandatories&#13;
        â&#128;¢ An entertainment-education approach. The soap opera must provoke discussion and interest, striking a balance&#13;
          between entertainment and content. Each episode must contain messages from the list provided. Messages&#13;
          should not be presented didactically (â&#128;&#156;you should . . .â&#128;?) but rather introduced naturally through characters, plot&#13;
          twists (outcome of a belief or behavior), or dialogue. The overall plot should progressively lead to the campaignâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
          desired outcome (a safe, modern community) with some â&#128;&#156;hiccupsâ&#128;? along the way.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Tone. Captivating, combining elements of drama and humor.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Characters. Appealing to rural households and reflecting relevant cultural values. At least one main char-&#13;
          acter should be included to model the desired attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. To maximize synergy with&#13;
          the Handwashing Project, character names and settings from the radio spots in development should be&#13;
          integrated into the soap opera.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Durability. Because it is hoped that the soap opera will continue, it should reach some level of resolution or&#13;
          closure after five episodes while allowing follow-on developments in plot or character development.&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Episode structure. Each episode should begin with a quick 30-second summary of previous episodes to&#13;
          refresh audienceâ&#128;&#153;s memory or bring new listeners up to speed. This summary should be easily removable&#13;
          if episodes are aired continuously (for example, through community-based CD players).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  4.2 Developing Communication Concepts&#13;
  Communication concepts represent broad directions for a given campaign&#13;
  and provide guidance for how each element will be executed. Concepts&#13;
  should build on insights from the formative research and serve as a plat-&#13;
  form or umbrella for all campaign elements. For example, the communi-&#13;
  cation concept behind the sanitation marketing campaign in Tanzania, is&#13;
  about empowering households to change their sanitation status and pro-&#13;
  pel them into taking action. Choo Bora is how this concept was executed.&#13;
&#13;
  A common mistake made by advertising agencies is to skip from the&#13;
  concept stage to a catchy visual/logo or slogan, which is an execu-&#13;
  tion of the concept. Program managers should be clear on what the&#13;
  concept is before going to the execution step. Conversely, some agen-&#13;
  cies execute the concept directly. Once the advertising agency has&#13;
  been contracted, program managers should meet with the firm to go&#13;
  through the brief and review the draft concepts that were included in&#13;
  the bid so that they are clear on what changes need to be made in the&#13;
  next version. See Box 8 for additional tips on managing an advertis-&#13;
  ing agency.&#13;
&#13;
  4.3 Testing Concepts and Communication Products&#13;
  Testing with target audiences occurs at two stages: concept and product&#13;
  development. Either the advertising agency developing the campaign or&#13;
  an independent firm can conduct the testing. At the early stage, concepts&#13;
  are tested to see whether they resonate with the targets. Preliminary slo-&#13;
  gans, logos, or visuals are shared to facilitate testing and feedback is used&#13;
  to refine them. Later on, draft products that have been developed (for&#13;
  example, storyboards for a TV commercial, or a broad plot and character&#13;
  description for a video drama) are tested on several criteria, including the     Final con&#13;
                                                                                            cept, cam&#13;
  following:                                                                                         paign po&#13;
                                                                                                             ster in Ta&#13;
                                                                                                                       nzania&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Comprehension. Do target audiences understand what is being&#13;

         would make materials more comprehensible?&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Attractiveness. Are materials appealing from a visual or auditory&#13;
         viewpoint? What would make them more attractive?&#13;

       â&#128;¢ Identification. Do the target audiences personally feel concerned&#13;
         by the materials? If not, why and what changes would make them&#13;
         relate more to the materials?&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Persuasion. How convincing are the materials and why?&#13;

  After communication materials have been produced, they are ready to dis-&#13;
  seminate through various channels, including mass media and interpersonal&#13;
  communication (IPC). Program managers should orient implementing part-&#13;
  ners and stakeholders on all the campaign materials so that they are clear&#13;
  on their purpose and how they should be used. For example, in Indonesia,&#13;
  WSP oriented 29 districts from East Java on how to use the Lik Telek and&#13;
  other campaign materials to support the rural sanitation program. Similarly,&#13;
  in India, WSP oriented stakeholders from Himachal Pradesh on the purpose&#13;
  of the BCC materials to support TSC.&#13;
&#13;
  Dissemination should be monitored to track reach and impact. See Section 5.4,&#13;
  Monitoring, for additional information.&#13;

     5.1   Roles of Multiple Sectors&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; The nonprofit, public, and private sectors each have roles in&#13;
             establishing and maintaining a sanitation marketing program.&#13;
 5.2       Suggested Staffing&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; It is important to properly staff a sanitation program from the   capacity-building specialist&#13;
             outset. Key positions are program manager; specialists in         district and regional coordinators&#13;
             marketing, capacity building, and monitoring and evaluation;      marketing specialist&#13;
             and district or regional coordinators.                            monitoring and evaluation specialist&#13;

     5.3   Capacity Building&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; As a complementary approach to CLTs, sanitation marketing         experiential learning cycle&#13;
             requires its own resources and tools for scaling up.              training delivery&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; Key tasks in capacity building include establishing training      training design&#13;
             standards, formulating a training strategy, recruiting skilled    training management&#13;
             training partners, and developing training materials.             training strategy&#13;
     5.4   Monitoring&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; Program managers should use various performance                   communication channels&#13;
             monitoring strategies to track progress against planned           cost exposure survey&#13;
             activities or outputs and intended outcomes, and adjust their     lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS)&#13;
             implementation strategy as necessary.                             media monitoring&#13;

     5.5   Budgeting&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; The budget for a sanitation marketing initiative must include&#13;
              costs for research, advertising agency, DCC activities,&#13;
              and capacity building, as well as related costs, such as&#13;
              microfinance or grant support through partner organizations.&#13;
     5.6   Procurement&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; Implementing a sanitation marketing program at scale requires&#13;
              sizable contracts for research, advertising, media placement,&#13;
              and capacity building.&#13;
     5.7   Sequencing Activities&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; A comprehensive sanitation marketing program will take about&#13;
              a year to progress from the planning and procurement phase&#13;
              to activity launch.&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; WSP strongly recommends maximizing synergies between&#13;
              CLTs and sanitation marketing activities with communication&#13;
              platforms.&#13;
           â&#156;&#148; Demand and supply strengthening activities must carefully&#13;
              sequenced to avoid shortfalls in which supplies do not match&#13;
              increasing demand.&#13;

  the capacity-building strategy include:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Develop a training strategy at the programâ&#128;&#153;s outset. This strategy&#13;
         should include a needs assessment, situation analysis, and plan. It is&#13;
         a comprehensive document that answers how, what, where, when,&#13;
         and why the training program will be designed and delivered.             CLTs&#13;

         ology that builds on participantsâ&#128;&#153; knowledge and experience to&#13;
         increase information retention.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Identify quality training partners to help develop training materials,&#13;
         and deliver and manage trainings. Using pre-established criteria for&#13;
         identifying training partners can assist in this process.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Develop high-quality training materials. Materials should be easy&#13;
         to translate into local languages and culturally appropriate. They&#13;
         should include a facilitator guide, a participant manual, and training&#13;
         aids (such as flip charts or PowerPoint slides) for each presentation.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Develop a monitoring and evaluation program. This program&#13;
         should include indicators to monitor training outcomes, a plan&#13;
         for collecting those indicators, and a vision for what to do with&#13;
         the collected data.                                                                                            Tanzania&#13;

      BOX 10: THE IMPORTANCE OF TOP-LINE RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
      A common practice in market research is to request that the consultant firm present top-line results before pro-&#13;
      ducing a report. Top-line results are the preliminary findings that can be quickly shared through a presentation&#13;
      format after the initial data analysis. Top-line results present the following advantages:&#13;
         â&#128;¢ They can be available shortly after data entry and sooner than a report.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ They provide critical information that can be fed into program design or support other decisions.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ They allow the program manager to request additional analyses and guide the final report writing.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ They allow a wider team to be exposed to the findings, including implementing agencies.&#13;

                              (1)Note this phase could take longer. If supply side research indicates that there is a lack of affordable products then more time may be needed to work with the private sector to develop an affordable product that meets&#13;
                              the needs of the consumer and is practical for the context. For example, the Easy Latrine in Cambodia was developed because low cost existing sanitation facilities were not durable during the rainy season; therefore, the&#13;
                              project had to inject innovation into the market. (2) Experience to date shows that rural sanitation providers are a fragmented group that would benefit from capacity building on appropriate technologies and business&#13;
                              skills. While the supply chain research will help refine the interventions, sector knowledge can be used to initiate the process as experience shows this process takes time to develop.&#13;

  cept of sanitation marketing, which under the Global Scal-&#13;

  Ps of the sanitation marketing strategy are fully developed.                                  building plan for developing a cadre of CLTS facilitators&#13;

  Common questions being raised by sector professionals are,                                    CLTS capacity building with the mason training in one&#13;
  â&#128;&#156;How should CLTS and sanitation marketing activities be se-                                   contract. Again the point is to think of the activities as one&#13;

  of launching sanitation marketing activities, should you wait                                 as closely together as possible. This requires all members&#13;
  to implement CLTS activities until the sanitation marketing                                   of the team including government partners of course50 to&#13;

  back specific interventions, but WSP strongly recommends                                      a joint manner even if there is different phasing. The more&#13;
  maximizing synergies between CLTS and sanitation market-                                      cohesive the planning, the easier it will be to communicate&#13;

Today, 2.6 billion people live without access to improved sanitation. Of these,&#13;
75 percent live in rural communities. To address this challenge, WSP is working&#13;
with governments and local private sectors to build capacity and strengthen&#13;
performance monitoring, policy, ï¬?nancing, and other components needed to&#13;
develop and institutionalize large-scale, sustainable rural sanitation programs. With&#13;
a focus on building a rigorous evidence base to support replication, WSP combines&#13;
Community-Led Total Sanitation, behavior change communication, and sanitation&#13;
marketing to generate sanitation demand and strengthen the supply of sanitation&#13;
products and services, leading to improved health for people in rural areas. For&#13;

&#13;
This Toolkit is one in a series of knowledge products designed to showcase ï¬?ndings,&#13;
assessments, and lessons learned through WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Scaling Up Rural Sanitation&#13;
program. It is conceived as a work in progress to encourage the exchange of ideas&#13;
about development issues. For more information please email Jacqueline Devine at&#13;

            Introductory guide to sanitation marketing
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Sanitation marketing is an emerging
            field with a relatively small group of practitioners who are
            learning by doing. With an introductory guide to sanitation
            marketing, the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) seeks to
            contribute to the field by sharing practical guidance on the
            design, implementation, and monitoring of rural sanitation
            marketing programs at scale in India, Indonesia, and
            Tanzania, plus additional projects implemented in Cambodia
            and Peru. Author's goal for this guide and toolkit is
            to: define sanitation marketing and the key components of
            sanitation marketing; initiative; provide an overall
            framework for scaling up rural sanitation programs and the
            justification for using a sanitation marketing approach;
            explain the steps needed to design, implement, and monitor
            sanitation marketing programs at scale; and highlight key
            challenges and recommend solutions. The print guide
            emphasizes at scale throughout. Although the concept of
            scale will be applied differently in each country, the focus
            should be on thinking big enough from the beginning to plan
            interventions that can be replicated effectively and
            efficiently across an entire country.
