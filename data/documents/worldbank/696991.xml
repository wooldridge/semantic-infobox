RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:           Republic of C6te d'lvoire&#13;
Beneficiary:        Societe Ivoirienne de Gestion du Patrimoine Ferroviaire (SIPF)&#13;
Poverty:            Not Applicable&#13;
Amount:             SDR 13.5 million, (US$20 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:              Standard IDA Terms with 40 year maturity&#13;
Onlending Terms:   To SIPF: 7.8 percent interest per annum, 15 years maturity including&#13;
3 years grace period for equipment rehabilitation; grant terms for&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation&#13;
Financing Plan:      See para. 2.7. The project is co-financed by four donor agencies.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
and Description:    In line with the Country Assistance Strategy, the project supports the&#13;
disengagement of Government from a major economic activity -rail&#13;
transport services-, for the future provision of which a Concession&#13;
Agreement-has been signed with a private operator. The project is part&#13;
of a larger program, covering both the Ivorian and the Burkina part of&#13;
the Abidjan-Ouagadougou-Kaya railways.  The main program  and&#13;
project objective is the revitalization of a major transport service&#13;
promoting competitiveness and regional integration. It provides the&#13;
financing necessary to carry out the long overdue rehabilitation of the&#13;
publicly-owned railway assets, that will henceforth be managed and&#13;
operated by the private concessionaire; the concession fee covers, inter&#13;
alia, the full debt service on the proposed investments. The main&#13;
project components cover:  (i) infrastructure rehabilitation  and&#13;
maintenance (selective replacement of rails and sleepers, reballasting,&#13;
bridge and culvert repairs); (ii) repair and maintenance of motive&#13;
power and rolling stock; (iii) rehabilitation and acquisition of&#13;
maintenance equipment; (iv) acquisition of computers; and (v) works&#13;
supervision and training.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
and Risks:          The benefits quantified for the economic analysis are reduced transport&#13;
costs on long distance bulk and container traffic, for which rail has an&#13;
economic advantage over road transport. Re-establishment of efficient&#13;
rail service will provide cost-effective transport for new mining exports&#13;
expected with the development of the mining sector in Burkina.&#13;
Additional but unquantified benefits are the preservation of an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
important infrastructural asset that will promote regional integration,&#13;
and turn rail transport from a loss-making activity requiring&#13;
Government subsidization into a commercially profitable one.&#13;
Risks are manageable, and would mainly result from a slower than&#13;
projected increase in the traffic attracted back from road transport.&#13;
However, the concessionaire who has the managerial independence to&#13;
operate services on a commercial basis, has competent personnel to&#13;
carry out the rehabilitation program on behalf of the patrimony&#13;
corporations, and has a financial interest in doing so rapidly and&#13;
thoroughly.  Traffic forecasts underlying the proposed investment&#13;
program are conservative, and an efficiently run railway should have&#13;
no difficulty to attract back from road transport the heavy, long&#13;
distance traffic its predecessors have lost due to poor operational and&#13;
commercial performance.&#13;
Environmental&#13;
Impact:              Activities financed under the project concern only rehabilitation of&#13;
existing equipment and infrastructure (selective replacement of rail and&#13;
sleepers on some sections of the track, re-ballasting, and repairs of&#13;
bridges and culverts, all on an embankment constructed some forty&#13;
years ago). Rehabilitation works will be monitored by the Ministry in&#13;
charge of the environment.  In addition, the concessionaire has&#13;
undertaken to provide training for some of its personnel in&#13;
environmental assessment and monitoring, so as to avoid negative&#13;
environmental impacts during project execution and in operations.&#13;
Economic Rate&#13;
of Return:           23 percent&#13;
Estimated Project&#13;
Completion Date:    December 31, 1999&#13;

REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE&#13;
RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
CHAPTER I.&#13;
COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A.    Country Setting&#13;
1.1    Cote d'Ivoire is one of the principal countries in the CFA zone. It is endowed with a&#13;
good natural resource base and has a population of some 13 million people. GDP in 1993 was&#13;
estimated at US$9.3 billion. A rapid build-up of external debt in the second half of the 1970s&#13;
when prices for the country's main exports, coffee and cocoa, peaked has saddled Cote&#13;
d'Ivoire with the highest per capita debt in West Africa: in 1993, when prices for these two&#13;
commodities had fallen to half their earlier level, the country's public external debt stood at&#13;
about US$15 billion. High population growth, coupled with economic decline, has reduced&#13;
per capita GNP from more than US$1,000 equivalent in the early 1980s to about US$515&#13;
equivalent in 1994. Due to mounting neglect of basic social services, social indicators have&#13;
been deteriorating significantly along with the decline in standards of living over the past&#13;
decade: recent estimates indicate that more than 60 percent of the population live below the&#13;
poverty line, compared to about 30 percent in the mid-1980s.&#13;
1.2    A series of sector and structural adjustment programs supported by the IMF, the Bank&#13;
and IDA from 1989 onward did not produce expected results, and GDP per capita contracted&#13;
by a cumulative 18 percent over the 1990-1993 period. In January 1994, Cote d'lvoire, along&#13;
with its partner countries in the CFA zone, decided to complement its internal adjustment&#13;
efforts with external measures of adjustment by realigning the parity of the CFA franc from&#13;
50 to 100 CFA to I FF.&#13;
1.3   Preliminary results for 1994 have been encouraging:  compared to other CFA&#13;
countries, Cote d'lvoire has managed the devaluation relatively well and has registered its first&#13;
positive growth (1.3 percent) in years. Government has succeeded in bringing inflation (0.3&#13;
percent/month in the last quarter of 1994) back to pre-devaluation levels within eight months&#13;
following devaluation. This has been largely due to a restrictive wage policy adopted by&#13;
Government and followed by the private sector (+ 10 percent of base wages on average).&#13;
Production data for the first three quarters of 1994 suggest a positive supply response&#13;
following devaluation: industrial production increased by about 30 percent overall, with&#13;
significantly larger increases for textiles and wood.&#13;
1.4    As regards fiscal policy, Government has been able to meet revenue and expenditure&#13;
targets set out in its 1994 Policy Framework Paper (PFP), producing a primary surplus of&#13;
about 1.5 percent of GDP. Preliminary data also indicate that export volumes increased by&#13;
about I percent, while import volumes fell by some 11 percent. As a result, the trade balance&#13;
surplus improved by some US$365 million.&#13;
1.5   But while Government succeeded in rapidly stabilizing the economy in 1994, it still&#13;
needs to deepen structural reforms, in order to realize PFP objectives which are to: (i) increase&#13;
real GDP growth to 6% annually; (ii) generate increasing primary budget surpluses; (iii)&#13;
strengthen external competitiveness through trade, price and regulatory reforms; (iv) intensify&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
human resource development and poverty alleviation efforts; and (v) protect the country's&#13;
natural resource base. This will require decisive additional actions in the areas of agriculture,&#13;
transport, the social sectors, and in private sector development.&#13;
1.6    Consequently, IDA's assistance strategy over the short and medium term will be to&#13;
help Government: (i) strengthen public sector finances through reforms in both revenue and&#13;
expenditure execution; (ii) promote private sector development through continued liberalization&#13;
of trade, financial and labor markets, and through investment in agriculture, industry and&#13;
transport; (iii)  make the human resource development program  more effective through&#13;
increased focus on primary health care, AIDS, population policy and basic education; (iv)&#13;
strengthen institutional capacity through existing technical assistance programs; and (v)&#13;
intensify environmental work through projects and through the NEAP process.&#13;
B.    The Transport Sector&#13;
1.7    Transport Infrastructure.    C6te  d'lvoire's transport sector absorbed  massive&#13;
investments during the 1970s and 1980s, not all of them economically justified. The country's&#13;
transport infrastructure is therefore very well developed: it has a road network of some 68,000&#13;
km, of which 5,300 km are paved; two deep water ports in Abidjan and San Pedro; three&#13;
international airports (Abidjan, Bouake and Yamoussoukro) and 22 smaller airfields serving&#13;
regional centers; and a single-track international railway line connecting Abidjan to&#13;
Ouagadougou and Kaya (630/1,260 km in Cote d'ivoire).&#13;
1 .8    Transport sector management has been less satisfactory. The Ministry of Equipment,&#13;
Transport and Telecommunications (METT) is charged with the administration of all sector&#13;
activities, from planning and programming, through road maintenance works execution by&#13;
force account, to supervision, coordination and regulation. A Directorate for Large-Scale&#13;
Works (Direction et Contr6le des Grands Travaux, DCGTx), was first set up within the&#13;
METT, but worked directly under the Presidency until 1990, when it was transferred to the&#13;
Prime Minister's office. It has had a powerful role in the technical and financial auditing of&#13;
activities of all major projects (costing US$1.5 million equivalent or more) in the public and&#13;
parastatal sectors. While it supplanted the role of the sector ministries in works programming,&#13;
procurement and supervision for well over a decade, it now works as a public sector company&#13;
(Societe Nationale) under the authority of the Prime Minister, and functions as a high-powered&#13;
Consulting Agency that carries out assignments on demand. Intermodal coordination,&#13;
theoretically provided by the Directorate of Planning, Programming and Project Management&#13;
(DPPGP) of METT, has traditionally been, and remains, weak.&#13;
1.9    Problems and Policy Issues. A large-scale National Transport Plan study was carried&#13;
out in 1989, followed by a Bank sector review in 1991 which covered the road, rail, maritime&#13;
and air transport subsectors. The study identified major problems and policy issues in the&#13;
areas of investment planning, of infrastructure maintenance financing, of operation and&#13;
management of the main public enterprises active in the sector, and in the existing regulatory&#13;
framework for transport activities.  A proposed IDA Transport Sector Loan, designed to&#13;
address some of these problems, became stalled over disagreements on the scope of proposed&#13;
reforms. Preparation of a subsequently proposed Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project&#13;
has also been slow. While the dialogue continues, it is becoming increasingly evident, that the&#13;
absence of decisive transport sector reform not only adds needless costs to local transactions,&#13;
thus hampering efficient functioning of internal markets and delivery of social services, but is&#13;
also very damaging to COte d'lvoire's competitiveness in external markets. Redress of some&#13;
of the most costly monopoly practices in the maritime transport sector has been achieved under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
the 1994 Economic Recovery Credit (Cr. 2656-IVC). The one subsector where significant&#13;
reforms, promoted under the ongoing Privatization Support Project (Cr. 2363-IVC) have&#13;
actually been introduced over the past two years, is railways.&#13;
C.    Developments in the Railway Subsector&#13;
1.10   The railway, a 1,260 km single track metric line constructed between 1904 and 1954&#13;
and connecting Abidjan and Ouagadougou, was managed from 1960-1986 as a public&#13;
corporation jointly owmed by Burkina and Cote d'lvoire (Regie des Chemins de Fer Abidjan-&#13;
Niger, RAN). Initially the favored mode for all bulk and passenger transport between the&#13;
coast and the Sahelian hinterland, the railways attained their operational peak in the mid-&#13;
seventies, when RAN transported close to a million tons of freight and some 4 million&#13;
passengers annually. In the late 1970s, operational and commercial performance of RAN&#13;
declined, while the road networks in the region improved, and the port of Lome emerged as a&#13;
competitor to Abidjan for Burkina traffic.  With increasing competition from  a rapidly&#13;
developing trucking industry, the share of traffic carried from the coast to Burkina by rail and&#13;
road respectively reversed from two-thirds/one-third in the mid-1970s to one-third/two-thirds&#13;
in the late-1980s, turning an initially profitable entity into a loss-making one.&#13;
1.11   A 1982 Diagnostic Study of RAN (financed under a C6te d'Ivoire Technical Assistance&#13;
Loan, Ln. 2059-IVC) identified the company's major problems and proposed a detailed&#13;
financial rehabilitation plan. This was to be implemented over the 1984-1990 period, with the&#13;
help of experienced expatriate management, and supported by an IDA Railway Rehabilitation&#13;
Project.&#13;
1.12   Disagreements between the two co-owners prevented adoption of this plan and RAN's&#13;
performance continued to deteriorate. In 1986, a decision in principle was taken to separate&#13;
the railways into tmw national companies, Societe ivoirienne des chemins de fer (SICF) and&#13;
Soci&amp;e des chemins de fer du Burkina (SCFB); it took until 1989 for the two companies to&#13;
become fully operational. As was easily foreseeable, this separation further exacerbated the&#13;
inefficiencies in the provision of rail transport services in the corridor and led to more shifts of&#13;
long distance traffic to road transport.&#13;
1.13  In an effort to stem and, if possible, reverse a trend that had reduced international&#13;
tonnage transported by rail to less than 300,000 tons per year, the railway component of the&#13;
Burkina Transport Sector Adjustment/Investment Program (Cr. 2332-BUR), approved by IDA&#13;
in early 1992, required the establishment of a joint SCFB/SICF Office (Bureau de Trafic&#13;
International, BTI) responsible for handling all international freight traffic and providing better&#13;
service for commercial customers. Although BTI had some initial success, traffic (down to&#13;
less than 220,000 tons in 1994) and revenue losses continued, and it became clear that only&#13;
drastic restructuring could prevent the financial collapse of the two companies and their&#13;
subsequent liquidation.&#13;
1.14   Consequently, in July 1992, the Governments of Burkina and Cote d'Ivoire announced&#13;
their decision in principle to reunify and privatize railway operations on the Abidjan-&#13;
Ouagadougou-Kaya axis, through a concession agreement to be signed with a private operator.&#13;
A commission comprising representatives of the Privatization Commissions of CMte d'Ivoire&#13;
and Burkina, the two ministries of transport, and of SICF and SCFB was set up to launch the&#13;
process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.15 The process has been strongly supported by IDA both through the CMte d'Ivoire&#13;
Privatization Support Project and the Burkina Transport Sector Adjustment Program. Advice&#13;
and comments provided by IDA and co-donors' staff at the various stages of the process were&#13;
substantially taken into account and significantly improved the design of the concession. Bids&#13;
were launched in February 1993 and bid award (to a consortium led by major freight-&#13;
forwarders operating in Western Africa) was made in July 1993. But it took seven negotiating&#13;
sessions over a one-and-a-half year period before a Concession Agreement acceptable to all&#13;
partners was signed on December 12, 1994. (A summary presentation of the concessionary&#13;
company, SITARAIL is in ANNEX 1.1). The Concession Agreement became effective on&#13;
August 20, 1995, and the Concessionaire took over operation of the railways on August 21,&#13;
1995. By that time, SCFB and SICF had been put into liquidation, and two new "patrimony&#13;
corporations", Socite' Ivoirienne de Gestion du Patrimoine Ferroviaire (SIPF) and SociNd de&#13;
Gestion du Patrimoine Ferroviaire BurAina (SOPAFER), had been created to hold the property&#13;
of existing railway equipment and manage rail infrastructure on behalf of the two States.&#13;
1.16   The main features of the Concession Agreement are as follows: the concession is a&#13;
"rolling concession" covering 15 years initially, with successive five-year extensions possible&#13;
thereafter. The concessionaire (SITARAIL) operates commercial freight and passenger&#13;
services in a fully-deregulated environment. SITARAIL is responsible for the maintenance of&#13;
rail infrastructure and of leased motive power and rolling stock, the ownership of which&#13;
remains with the two "patrimony corporations", SIPF and SOPAFER. The Concessionaire has&#13;
rehired the personnel required (1,815) from among existing railway staff (3,470, of which&#13;
some 1,370 in SCFB and some 2,100 in SICF). The Governments have provided severance&#13;
payments to surplus staff not rehired by the private operator. Rehabilitation investments are&#13;
proposed by the concessionaire. The two patrimony corporations handle borrowing on behalf&#13;
of the two Governments who, although responsible for servicing the debt related to both&#13;
infrastructure renewal and upgrading, and to equipment rehabilitation and acquisition, will&#13;
recover these debt service payments fully from the concessionaire. The concession fee paid by&#13;
the concessionaire to the Governments comprises: (i) an infrastructure user fee calculated as a&#13;
percentage of the concessionaire's revenue; (ii) equipment lease payments, the calculation of&#13;
which is defined in the Concession Agreement; and (iii) debt service coverage on the railway&#13;
rehabilitation investments. Third-party rail service operators can be authorized after a 7-year&#13;
exclusivity period.&#13;
1.17. The two patrimony corporations, SOPAFER and SIPF, are public sector companies&#13;
charged with the administration of the railways' property on behalf of the two Governments.&#13;
An agreement for the management of railway assets between the Ivorian Government and SIPF&#13;
has been signed as a condition of presentation of the proposed Credit to the Board; publication&#13;
of the Decree approving the agreement is a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
D.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Projects and Rationale for IDA&#13;
Involvement&#13;
1.18   IDA's involvement in the railway subsector dates back to 1978, when a Regional&#13;
Railway Project (Ln. 1490-IVC/Cr. 744-UV) was approved that included improvement of&#13;
track, renewal of rolling stock, and technical assistance and training for management and&#13;
operations improvement of RAN. Its implementation took three years longer than foreseen,&#13;
and railway performance deteriorated markedly over the project implementation period. In the&#13;
absence of credible reform actions, a proposed follow-on rehabilitation program was not&#13;
pursued (cf. para. 1.12 above). In the road subsector, where the Bank provided eight loans&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
between 1968 and 1985 for a total of US$333 million, including two Highway Sector loans of&#13;
US$100 and US$110 million respectively, performance was somewhat better. But since the&#13;
early  1990s, unwillingness to address the multiple problems of   proper investment&#13;
programming, maintenance funding and efficient works execution has made it difficult to&#13;
justify continued IDA involvement in the sector. Thus, the project is the first IDA operation&#13;
in Cote d'lvoire's transport sector since the Second Highway Sector Loan, which was&#13;
approved in 1985 and closed in 1990, ending a ten-year hiatus that has been due to slow&#13;
progress on sectoral reforms needed to make proposed investments sustainable.&#13;
1 .19 The rationale for proceeding with the project is that substantial reforms, fully&#13;
consistent with IDA's country assistance strategy, have been decided on, and are being&#13;
implemented, in the railway subsector (cf. paras. 1.14-1.15 above). Acceptable institutional&#13;
arrangements, necessary for re-establishing competitive and efficient rail services in the&#13;
Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor, have been agreed upon by the two Governments and formally&#13;
spelled out in the Concession Agreement (para. 1.16 above) that was signed with a private&#13;
operator in December 1994, the first such arrangement in Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
1.20   IDA  had been promoting reform  and rehabilitation of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou&#13;
railway for well over a decade, since it can have a demonstrable competitive advantage over&#13;
road transport for certain types of traffic and can therefore play an important role in making&#13;
the economies of both Burkina and of Cote d'lvoire more efficient. In the absence of the&#13;
necessary restructuring and reform actions, earlier proposed projects were abandoned. But&#13;
within the framework of the Concession Agreement, both the Burkina and the Cote d'Ivoire&#13;
Governments have now agreed to the essential preconditions for efficient railway operations in&#13;
a manner satisfactory to IDA and co-donors. The project is a major element for promoting the&#13;
success of the concessioning of rail activities to the private sector in Cote d'lvoire and&#13;
Burkina. This new arrangement for the operation of rail transport services fits very well with&#13;
one of the main objectives of IDA's assistance strategy for both countries: Governments'&#13;
disengagement from a major economic activity, which will henceforth be carried out by the&#13;
private sector. Operating deficits of the two railway companies SICF and SCFB, which were&#13;
borne by Government budgets, will be eliminated. More efficient rail services for freight&#13;
transport will improve the competitiveness of the economies of both Cote d'Ivoire and&#13;
Burkina.  In addition, regional integration between Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina will be&#13;
significantly strengthened.&#13;

CHAPTER II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Program and Project Objectives&#13;
2.1    The proposed project is part of a larger program for the overall rehabilitation of the&#13;
full Abidjan/Ouagadougou/Kaya railways, covered by the Concession Agreement. The project&#13;
covers the Ivorian component of the program; the Burkina part of the program, which has been&#13;
appraised concurrently, is also fully financed (see para. 2.7 below). To reflect the fact that&#13;
project justification intimately depends on the justification of the overall program, reference&#13;
will be made in the following to either (or both) program and project objectives and&#13;
characteristics, as appropriate. The main program and project objectives are to contribute to&#13;
the revitalization of a major transport service promoting competitiveness and regional&#13;
integration, by providing the financing necessary to carry out the long overdue rehabilitation of&#13;
the publicly-owned railway infrastructure and equipment assets. These will be managed and&#13;
operated by the private concessionaire, who needs the rehabilitation investments to enable it to&#13;
provide efficient quality service.&#13;
B.    Program and Project Description&#13;
2.2    The proposed rehabilitation program is the first in support of a railway to be operated&#13;
by a private concessionaire in Sub-Saharan Africa. As indicated above, the program will have&#13;
two parts:&#13;
* one in Cote d'lvoire, for the rehabilitation of railway equipment (motive power and&#13;
rolling stock) owned by SIPF, and of railway infrastructure situated on Ivorian territory,&#13;
for which financing will be channeled through SIPF, under the project, and&#13;
* one in Burkina, for the rehabilitation of railway equipment (motive power and rolling&#13;
stock) owned by SOPAFER, and of railway infrastructure situated on the Burkinabe&#13;
territory, for which financing will be channeled through SOPAFER, under similar&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
2.3    The main components of the program and their estimated base costs are as follows:&#13;
(I) Infrastructure rehabilitation is estimated at US$29.9 million. It covers: (i) selective&#13;
track renewal (75 km) and repair (41 km of sleepers and 66 km of rail replacement); (ii)&#13;
ballasting ( 111 ,000 m3); (iii) bridge and culvert repairs; (iv) embankment repairs; (v)&#13;
installation of weighing equipment; and (vi) some building repairs (workshops, stations). (II)&#13;
Equipment rehabilitation and acquisition under the program is estimated at US$42.4 million&#13;
overall. The motive powver and rolling stock rehabilitation component accounts for about&#13;
US$30.8 million and covers:  (i) the general overhaul or rehabilitation of 20 main-line&#13;
locomotives; (ii) rehabilitation of 17 shunting locomotives; (iii) rehabilitation of 375 freight&#13;
cars (out of a total of 600 leased by the Concessionaire); (iv) rehabilitation of 40 passenger&#13;
coaches; and (v) establishment of a stock of essential spare parts. The maintenance equipment&#13;
component, accounting for US$9.0 million, includes: (i) the rehabilitation and acquisition of&#13;
essential track maintenance equipment and tools; and (ii) rehabilitation of maintenance&#13;
facilities. A small telecommunication component accounts for US$1.8 million and covers: (i)&#13;
the rehabilitation and improvement of the train-to-ground radio system; (ii) the installation of a&#13;
radio block operating system; (iii) the replacement of PABX in the four major activities centers&#13;
(Abidjan-Bouake-Bobo Dioulasso-Ouagadougou) and five medium size stations; and (iv)&#13;
miscellaneous small repairs, acquisition of maintenance vehicles and establishment of a stock&#13;
of essential spare parts. A last component is related to the acquisition of computers (US$0.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
million) for providing the operation with modern management tools. Finally, for (111) Works&#13;
supervision and training, some US$2.5 million are foreseen.&#13;
2.4     The Cote d'lvoire project accounts for some 59 percent of the base cost of both the&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation component (US$17.7 million) and the equipment&#13;
rehabilitation and acquisition component (US$24.9 million). Within this latter component,&#13;
the project covers 60 percent (US$18.4 million) of the rehabilitation of motive power and&#13;
rolling stock, 53 percent (US$4.8 million) of the maintenance equipment subcomponent, 67&#13;
percent (US$1.2 million) of the telecommunication equipment and 63 percent (US$0.5 million)&#13;
of the computer equipment. Finally, the project covers 48 percent (US$1.2 million) of the&#13;
works supervision and training component. The specific project items financed by IDA are&#13;
detailed in ANNEX 2.1 and in para 3.4 below.&#13;
C.      Program  and Project Cost&#13;
2.5    Initial detailed cost estimates prepared by the private operator SITARAIL  were&#13;
reviewed and updated during appraisal. The total cost of the program including physical and&#13;
price contingencies, but excluding local import duties and taxes, is estimated at CFA franc&#13;
40.5 billion (some US$81.0 million equivalent), of which the proposed project represents 24.0&#13;
billion (US$48.0 million equivalent). Base costs are in mid-1995 prices; the project will be&#13;
executed over a four year period, with most of the expenditures incurred during the first two&#13;
years (about 85 percent). Detailed program and project costs and the shares expected to be&#13;
financed by the co-financiers are in ANNEX 2. 1. Physical contingencies are estimated at 4.7&#13;
percent of base cost. Price contingencies, estimated at 3.6 percent, are based on the following&#13;
annual inflation rates (in accordance with O.P.6.50 for the foreign exchange component and on&#13;
country data for local currency):&#13;

D.    Program and Project Financing&#13;
2.7    The program  is co-financed by Caisse Francaise de Developpement (CFD), the&#13;
European Investment Bank (EIB), the West African Development Bank (BOAD) and the&#13;
Belgian Government (AGCD). Cofinanciers will finance around US$43.8 million equivalent&#13;
under parallel co-financing arrangements with US$23.0 million going to the Burkina part of&#13;
the program and US$20.8 million going to the C6te d'lvoire part. IDA will finance US$26.4&#13;
million equivalent with US$6.4 million for the Burkina part and US$20 million for the CMte&#13;
d'lvoire part. The IDA portion of the C6te d'lvoire part of the program is financed by the&#13;
project.  IDA funds will he onlent to the patrimony corporation SIPF under a Subsidiary&#13;
Financing Agreement: 7.8 percent of interest per annum for 15 years including 3 years grace&#13;
period, the foreign exchange risk being borne by the ivorian government, for the motive&#13;
power, rolling stock, telecommunication and computer components, and at grant terms for&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation and consultant services. The signature of the Subsidiary Financing&#13;
Agreement will be a condition of credit effectiveness. The IDA portion of the Burkina part of&#13;
the program will be financed through a partial reallocation of funds already available under the&#13;
Transport Sector Adjustment/investment Credit (Cr. 2332 BUR); the respective amendment&#13;
has been made following appraisal and finalization of the co-financing arrangements, and a&#13;
Subsidiary Financing Agreement will be entered into between the Government of Burkina and&#13;
the patrimony corporation SOPAFER, to whom the IDA funds will be onlent at the same terms&#13;
and conditions as those applied in onlending to SIPF. The concessionaire's contribution to the&#13;
program amounts to some US$10.8 million equivalent and will cover part of the local cost of&#13;
civil works (labor, transport, insurance, etc.). Financing arrangements are summarized in&#13;
Table 2.3 below; detailed items financed by each donor are in ANNEX 2.1. Compliance with&#13;
conditions precedent to the first disbursement on the loans contracted with CFD and EIB will&#13;
be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;

d'lvoire and SIPF, will be fully recovered from  SITARAIL through its payment of the&#13;
dedicated part of the concession fee (see para. 1.15 above) to SIPF (and SOPAFER, for the&#13;
Burkina portion of the program). These payments would be made into a separate account to be&#13;
opened in the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA).  Financing of rehabilitation&#13;
investments through the Government-owned patrimony corporations with debt service&#13;
payments made by the Concessionaire is considered an acceptable arrangement, as the private&#13;
sector is not willing, in thie prevailing context, to take all investment risks.&#13;

CHAPTER III.&#13;
PROGRAM AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.1    The program and the project will be implemented over a four year period by the&#13;
Concessionaire SITARAIL (acting as a 'maitre doeuvre d&amp;lIgue") on behalf of the two&#13;
patrimony corporations SIPF and SOPAFER. The respective responsibilities of SITARAIL&#13;
and SIPF are set out in the SITARAIL Implementation Agreement, signature of which by SIPF&#13;
and SITARAIL is a condition of credit effectiveness. The bulk of the rehabilitation will be&#13;
done within the first two years of the program. SITARAIL has a financial interest in executing&#13;
the rehabilitation program rapidly and thoroughly; it has put a technically (including&#13;
procurement expertise)  and commercially competent management team  in charge of a&#13;
streamlined staff selected from among that of the existing railway companies, and should be&#13;
rapidly in position to improve operations.&#13;
B.    Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.2    Since privatization of rail service provision is fully consistent with IDA's country&#13;
assistance strategy, and since its modalities have been discussed by both Governments with&#13;
IDA and the co-donors over a three-year period, as they were being agreed with the&#13;
Concessionaire within the framework of a formal Concession Agreement acceptable to IDA&#13;
and co-financiers, there are no major outstanding project issues. Rules for review by the&#13;
patrimony corporations (SIPF and SOPAFER) of procurement decisions prepared by&#13;
SITARAIL have been prepared in accordance with IDA Guidelines (see para. 3.3 ff. below)&#13;
and will be processed in such a way that most contracts can be signed shortly after credit&#13;
effectiveness. The two Governments have compensated redundant staff.&#13;
C.    Procurement&#13;
3.3    The following table summarizes expected distribution of project costs by procurement&#13;
method and category of expenditure.   For the IDA-financed portion of the project,&#13;
procurement will be carried out in accordance with IDA Guidelines (January 1995). Standard&#13;
bidding documents for most of the items to be procured under ICB and LIB procedures have&#13;
already been prepared and will be cleared by IDA prior to credit signing. (This also applies to&#13;
the Burkina part of the program).&#13;

3.4   Items financed by IDA cover the following: (i) for infrastructure rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance (track maintenance, repairs and upgrade) US$9.6 million, of which for: (a)&#13;
ballast (US$1.3 million); (b) rail (US$3.9 million), sleepers (US$2.4 million) and rail welding&#13;
supplies (US$0.7 million); (c) rail fastenings (US$1.3 million); (ii) for equipment&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance US$10.4 million, of which for motive power and rolling stock:&#13;
(a) main-line locomotive spare parts (US$4.3 million) and sub-components (US$3.4 million);&#13;
(b) maintenance tools and machinery (US$1.7 million); (iii) for improvement of the&#13;
telecommunication systems: (a) telecommunication spare parts and maintenance equipment&#13;
(US$0.2 million); (b) maintenance vehicles (US$0.3 million); (c) installation of a radio-token&#13;
block system (US$0.5 million).&#13;
3.5   International Competitive Bidding.  The following items will be purchased through&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB):&#13;
* part of the reconstruction of electric traction motors of main line locomotives&#13;
(US$0.5 million)&#13;
* part of the main line locomotive spare parts and sub-components (US$1.3 million);&#13;
* part of the maintenance tools and machinery (US$1.3 million);&#13;
* the totality of rail, sleepers and rail welding supplies, and part of rail fastenings&#13;
(US$7.3 million).&#13;
For sleepers, separate bids will be launched for steel and concrete sleepers.&#13;
3.6    Limited International Bidding.  Limited International Bidding (LIB) will be used for&#13;
the acquisition of part of rail fastenings of a specialized (Pandrol-type) nature (US$1.0&#13;
million). Potential suppliers are all suppliers which hold the license for the manufacture of the&#13;
selected type of fastenings.&#13;
3.7    National Competitive Bidding. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be used for&#13;
the acquisition of ballast (US$1.3 million). In view of the nature and the volume of the goods,&#13;
foreign bidders are unlikely to be interested in bidding.&#13;
3.8    Shopping.  International (US$750,000) and national (US$750,000) shopping will be&#13;
used for the acquisition of:&#13;
* part of the main line locomotive spare parts (US$0.5 million in aggregate, each&#13;
contract not to exceed US$50,000); these parts are low-cost, miscellaneous spares&#13;
needed for locomotive rehabilitation which cannot be identified in detail during&#13;
preparation of rehabilitation programs;&#13;
* part of the maintenance tools (US$0.5 million in aggregate, each contract not to&#13;
exceed US$50,000);&#13;
* telecommunication spare parts and maintenance equipment, including micro-&#13;
computers and other proprietary office technology equipment associated with the&#13;
installation of the radio-token block system (US$0.2 million in aggregate); and&#13;
* maintenance vehicles (US$0.3 million).&#13;
3.9    Direct Contracting. Direct contracting will be used for (i) part of the acquisition of&#13;
proprietary main-line locomotive parts and sub-components from the original equipment&#13;
manufacturer (US$4.8 million), and (ii) emergency repair of electric traction motors for&#13;
locomotives, which it has been determined to be feasible in a local workshop at a competitive&#13;
cost (US$0.5 million).&#13;

3.10   Consulting services.  Procedures defined in Bank Group guidelines for the use of&#13;
consultants will be used for the design and installation of a radio-token block system (US$0.5&#13;
million).&#13;
3.11   Procurement Review. Procurement done under ICB, LIB, NCB and Direct Contracting&#13;
for contracts exceeding US$100,000, as well as procurement of contracts for consulting&#13;
services, will be subject to prior review by IDA.  Prior review will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with IDA guidelines. At negotiations, standard procurement processing times for&#13;
key activities have been agreed with the Borrower.&#13;
D.    Disbursement&#13;
3.12   Disbursement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.2 below. Disbursements for&#13;
goods costing less than US$100,000 and of consultant services costing less than US$100,000&#13;
for firms and US$50,000 for individuals will be made against statements of expenditures&#13;
(SOEs); documentation of SOEs will be retained by SITARAIL and will be made available for&#13;
review by IDA supervision missions and auditors. Other disbursements will be made against&#13;
standard documentation prepared by the SITARAIL and approved by the patrimony&#13;
corporation. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be set up in the CAA and&#13;
SITARAIL will operate a "Project Account" at the CAA to be fed from the Special Account;&#13;
the initial deposit would be in CFA franc equivalent to US$500,000. This amount is estimated&#13;
to cover project expenditures for about four months, excluding expenditures for imports of&#13;
goods to be covered by letters of credit and guaranteed by IDA's special commitment. The&#13;
Special Account will be replenished by submitting withdrawal applications to IDA on a&#13;
monthly basis or sooner, when the accounts are diminished by one-third.&#13;

3.14   SITARAIL will manage all accounting records and will prepare supporting documents.&#13;
Annual audits will be carried out by auditors acceptable to IDA on the project and program&#13;
accounts; the audited accounts together with a management letter will be forwarded to IDA and&#13;
the other donor agencies within six months of the close of each fiscal year. The auditors'&#13;
report on project and program expenditures will verify that: (i) accounts permit identification&#13;
of all receipts and payments; (ii) goods have been received and works performed; (iii)&#13;
payments have been made; (iv) all expenditures have been legitimate; and (v) the special&#13;
account has been used appropriately. Selection of the Program Auditor is a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
3.15   SIPF will provide an audited opening balance sheet not later than March 1, 1996.&#13;
Subsequently, the company will be audited annually by the program auditor during project&#13;
execution.&#13;
F.    Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
3.16   As foreseen under the Concession Agreement, a Monitoring Committee (Comite de&#13;
Suivi) set up by the conceding parties will supervise project implementation and SITARAIL&#13;
operations in accordance with agreed procedures. These procedures, together with those for&#13;
procurement set out in the Concession Agreement, and with a series of performance indicators&#13;
to be monitored quarterly and annually during project execution are included in a Project&#13;
Implementation Manual, a summary outline of which is presented in ANNEX 3.1. The&#13;
Project Implementation Manual was discussed during negotiations; its adoption by the&#13;
Concessionaire and the patrimony corporation is a condition of credit effectiveness. A mid-&#13;
term review will be held not later than November 30, 1997.&#13;

CHAPTER IV.&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    Traffic Projections&#13;
4.1    Freight Traffic.  The present (1994) volume of freight transported by the railway&#13;
(about 300,000 tons) is the lowest recorded since the start-up of railway activities. The main&#13;
reasons for this are: (i) poor equipment availability due to prolonged lack of maintenance and&#13;
degradation of infrastructure; (ii) poor commercial policy and client service due to&#13;
management and coordination problems between SICF and SCFB; and (iii) competition from&#13;
more reliable road transport.   Of the total volume transported, two-thirds represent&#13;
international traffic. Imports through/from Cote d'Ivoire to Burkina, account for 85 percent of&#13;
this, mainly petroleum products, containers, cement, grains, and fertilizers; the remaining 15&#13;
percent represent Burkina exports, mainly cotton, cattle and other agricultural products.&#13;
National traffic accounts for only one third of total traffic and is concentrated in C6te d'lvoire.&#13;
It mainly concerns petroleum products transported from Abidjan to Bouake (80,000/100,000&#13;
tons in 1994).&#13;
4.2   In the first year of activity of the Concessionaire, traffic volume is expected to increase&#13;
from 240 TKm million (292,000 tons) to 370 TKm million (504,000 tons). This would be due&#13;
to the railways' attracting back a significant part of long distance bulk traffic for which it has a&#13;
clear advantage over road transport, and is estimated to lead to: (i) an increase of about 10&#13;
percent in the international traffic and of some 135 percent in national traffic.  Increased&#13;
volumes of petroleum products, for which rail has an advantage over road transport both in&#13;
terms of cost and safety; would account for the bulk of this; (ii) the emergence of important&#13;
new traffic (clinker and manganese): estimates of clinker traffic (some 50,000 tons) are based&#13;
on production capacity of the cement factory located in Ouagadougou which has started&#13;
operations in early 1995. Manganese exports are estimated at a modest 20,000 tons annually,&#13;
projected for sale in small niche markets. Since the cost of transporting these commodities by&#13;
rail are lower than those for road transport, and since the customers for this service are among&#13;
the shareholders of SITARAIL, the shift back of this traffic to rail should be quite rapid.&#13;
4.3    Traffic projections in subsequent years, when the re-established production capacity is&#13;
expected to be used to the full under improved railway management, the Concessionaire will&#13;
be able to gain back markets from road transport in which rail is more competitive. By the&#13;
year 2000, freight traffic is estimated at 560 Tkm; details for each category of freight are in&#13;
ANNEX 4.1. The graphic below summarizes actual and projected freight data for the 1980-&#13;
1995-2001 period.&#13;

4.4    Passenger Traffic.  Present (1994) rail passenger traffic consists of some 750,000&#13;
international and national passengers (250 PKm million). Although rail passenger transport is&#13;
economically justified for long distance traffic only, SCFB and SICF have been operating short&#13;
distance domestic traffic for cash generation, charging tariffs that do not cover the cost of the&#13;
services provided to beat road transport competition.&#13;
4.5         Traffic projections in the first two years of activity of the Concessionaire assume a&#13;
reduction of passenger traffic due to: (i) a 25 percent increase in tariffs to achieve cost&#13;
recovery; and (ii) the abandonment of unprofitable domestic services. In subsequent years&#13;
traffic volumes are expected to increase by 25 percent annually on average, in response to&#13;
improvements in the quality of service. By the year 2001, one million passengers (374 PKm&#13;
million) would be transported, corresponding to half the mid-80s' international passenger&#13;
traffic volume. The graphic below summarizes actual and projected passenger traffic volumes&#13;
for the period 1980-1995-2001.&#13;

transport for new mining exports (manganese, zinc) expected with the development of the&#13;
mining sector in Burkina. Important additional benefits include: avoiding liquidation pure and&#13;
simple of SICF and SCFB, thereby preserving an important infrastructural asset, turning rail&#13;
transport from a heavily subsidized activity into a commercially profitable one; anll&#13;
contributing to improved regional integration through more efficient handling of internationIai&#13;
traffic; these benefits have not been quantified.&#13;
4.7    Results of the Economic Analysis. The most likely Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of&#13;
the program, based on the quantified benefits (transport cost savings) only, is estimated at 23&#13;
percent. Savings from transport of petroleum products are by far the most important and&#13;
account for 61 percent of the total savings: rail transport costs are one-third those of estimated&#13;
road transport costs, and savings on this traffic alone would result in a 10 percent ERR for the&#13;
program. Savings from transport of clinker, expected to represent a sizable volume of new&#13;
traffic, represent some 15 percent of total savings. Also important are savings on the transport&#13;
of containers and cement (10 and 5 percent of total savings respectively).  International&#13;
passenger traffic accounts for no more than 3 percent of total transport cost savings.&#13;
4.8     Sensitivity Analysis. To test the robustness of the analysis, a number of alternative&#13;
scenarios and their impact on the ERR of the program were examined; the results are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.1 below. Even under very pessimistic assumptions (traffic volume of&#13;
only 75 percent of most likely levels combined with an increase in program cost of 25 percent&#13;
compared to base case assumptions, Scenario F3; or traffic volume of only 75 percent of most&#13;
likely levels and a two-year delay in the materialization of projected traffic, Scenario F4), the&#13;
program would still have an ERR of 10 percent. Charts showing the sensitivity of the analysis&#13;
to variations in the main parameters taken into account are in ANNEX 4.2; costs used in the&#13;
base cost-benefit analysis are summarized in para. 4.9 below and presented in ANNEX 4.3;&#13;
details of the long run marginal cost calculations are in the Project File.&#13;

4.9    Assumptions for the Economic Analysis. The economic analysis compares estimated&#13;
traffic volumes and long-run marginal costs of rail transport 'with" and "without the&#13;
program". The main assumptions for the cost-benefit analysis are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
* 'With the Program", freight and international passenger traffic is expected to&#13;
increase as described in section A above; national passenger traffic is expected to&#13;
be discontinued because of its financial unprofitability.&#13;
* "Without the Program", all freight traffic and international passenger traffic is&#13;
expected to continue their long-term decline, falling to zero at the end of three&#13;
years, when the SICF and SCFB would have exhausted their remaining operational&#13;
capacity and collapsed.  National passenger traffic would be maintained at its&#13;
current level and come to a stop at the end of year three.&#13;
* Long-run marginal costs of rail transport include: (i) operating costs (fuel and&#13;
lubricants, operating crew costs); (ii) equipment maintenance costs (manpower and&#13;
spare parts); (iii) depreciation and interest on motive power and rolling stock; and&#13;
(iv) infrastructure maintenance costs. These are based on consultants' and mission&#13;
estimates for the "with the Program" case; "without the Program" unit costs,&#13;
reflecting present run-down conditions, overstaffing and poor coordination between&#13;
two national companies, are very conservatively estimated at 125 percent of the&#13;
"with Program" costs.&#13;
*  Road transport costs for both the 'with" and "without the Program" cases are&#13;
based on 1995 vehicle operating costs excluding taxes, estimated by DCGTx.&#13;
These include depreciation and interest on equipment, but exclude infrastructure&#13;
maintenance costs, for which road users pay through user charges such as taxes on&#13;
fuel, spare parts etc.&#13;
The economic evaluation of the program is in mid-1995 prices (US$1 =CFA franc 500), for all&#13;
costs and benefits net of taxes. Total investment costs under the program were taken into&#13;
account, no shadow prices were applied.&#13;
C.    Financial Evaluation&#13;
4. 10 Financial Performance of SICF and RAN. When RAN, the railway jointly owned by&#13;
Cote d'lvoire and Burkina, was dissolved in 1989 and separated into the two successor&#13;
companies SICF and SCFB, its cumulative deficit exceeded CFA franc 50 billion and its total&#13;
debt stood at about CFA franc 100 billion (although it was also owed some CFA franc 68.7&#13;
billion, of which CFA franc 26 billion by the Ivorian Government and CFA franc 41.6 billion&#13;
by the Burkinabe Government). At separation, the Government of Cote d'Ivoire received&#13;
assets totaling CFA franc 84.7 billion and assumed CFA franc 56.3 billion in RAN debts. In&#13;
addition, SICF was to receive CFA franc 3 billion in fresh capital. But this was never&#13;
released, thus condemning SICF to survive exclusively on the revenues it generated. These&#13;
were barely sufficient to cover the wagebill for the company's 2000+ employees, the cost of&#13;
fuel and lubricants to keep (increasingly fewer) trains operating, and the most urgently needed&#13;
spare parts. Taxes and social security contributions were left unpaid; these constitute the bulk&#13;
of SICF cumulative debts of some CFA franc 9.2 billion in 1995. Table 4.2 shows a few&#13;
indicators of the disastrous evolution of the railway companies' finances over the past 10&#13;
years; summary SICF income statements for the 1989/90-1993 period are in ANNEX 4.4.&#13;

4.11   Financial Equilibrium. SITARAIL funds come from: (i) equity capital of CFA franc 5&#13;
billion; (ii) financing of rehabilitation program investments (with the bulk of disbursement&#13;
expected during the first three years of operation); and (iii) operating revenues. Operation by&#13;
the Concessionaire is expected to have two main effects on the railways' activity: increased&#13;
revenues due to increases in both tariffs and traffic (better marketing to re-attract existing&#13;
traffic and emergence of new traffic as described in Section 4.A above), and normalization of&#13;
operational expenditures, i.e. decreased expenses due mainly to reductions in personnel costs&#13;
of about 50 percent, and to tighter control of overhead expenses (20 percent less than those of&#13;
SICF and SCFB). In combination, these expected developments are estimated to make a&#13;
previously high deficit activity commercially viable and potentially profitable, thus relieving&#13;
the two Governments of substantial subsidy payment requirements.&#13;

4.12   Financial Perfornance. Financial estimates based on base case traffic projections (but&#13;
with slightly lower assumptions for cement/clinker traffic), and on tariff levels projected by the&#13;
Concessionaire, have been established for the initial 15-year concession period. Projected&#13;
financial performance of the Concessionaire for the 1995-2000 period, is summarized in Table&#13;
4.3 above. Detailed 1995-2010 projections for Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Ratio&#13;
Analysis, and for Sources and Application of Funds are presented in ANNEX 4.5.&#13;
4.13   According to these projections, the Concessionaire would achieve a positive operating&#13;
result starting in the fifth year of activity. Net income is estimated to remain negative for the&#13;
first four years of the concession, due mainly to very substantial amounts allocated for&#13;
engineering consultancy during this period, when rehabilitation investments are being&#13;
implemented. Expected cumulative losses of about CFA franc 3 billion would be covered by&#13;
the CFA franc 5 billion of equity capital. In subsequent years, net income is expected to&#13;
improve and would reach some CFA franc 4 billion in year 15 of the concession period.&#13;
4.14   Assumptions underlying the financial projections.   The assumptions for traffic&#13;
forecasts, tariffs, staff and personnel costs, maintenance costs, and for fuel and lubricant&#13;
consumption used in the financial projections are as follows:&#13;
&#149; the base case scenarios for freight and passenger traffic set out in Section 4.A&#13;
above have been used for financial projections, except that somewhat lower&#13;
volumes of cement/clinker traffic have been assumed;&#13;
&#149;  tariff levels are those that the Concessionaire plans to implement:  while not&#13;
uniformly so, they represent an average increase of about 25 percent for both&#13;
freight and passenger traffic over present tariffs, which had been increased by 35&#13;
percent for freight and 25 percent for passenger transport following devaluation.&#13;
The new tariff structure covers estimated operating costs and is based on market&#13;
conditions for the long distance transport of bulk goods;&#13;
* the Concessionaire will operate with a staff of 1,815 employees;&#13;
* rolling stock and motive power maintenance costs have been evaluated on the basis&#13;
of a normalized average unit cost per engine in the fleet. At the beginning of the&#13;
concession period, these costs are relatively low due to implementation of the&#13;
externally financed rehabilitation program. Subsequently, a periodic overhaul of&#13;
locomotives every five years has been planned:  the corresponding costs are&#13;
covered through an annual provision;&#13;
* the costs of infrastructure maintenance works are calculated on the basis of annual&#13;
gross ton kilometers transported; again, due to the execution of externally financed&#13;
rehabilitation works, they are low during the first years of operations;&#13;
* costs of fuel and lubricant consumption is considered as proportional to annual&#13;
train kilometers (with 25 percent estimated to be incurred in Burkina and 75&#13;
percent in Cote d'lvoire).&#13;
4.15   Operating revenues are expected to increase sharply from the first year of activity,&#13;
thanks to a marketing and commercial policy which would target specific increases in traffic&#13;
volumes through implementation of a competitive tariff policy. However, compared to historic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
revenue levels in the early 80s, anticipated revenues remain modest. Traditional freight traffic&#13;
provides the main share of revenues (about 70 percent), passenger traffic accounts for 10&#13;
percent of revenues, and the remaining 20 percent are from new freight traffic.&#13;
4.16   Operating expenses are still dominated by personnel costs, which represent about 50&#13;
percent in the first year of operations and decrease to 37 percent of operating expenses after&#13;
five years. This reflects an assumption of virtually constant staff costs with rising traffic&#13;
volumes over the concession period. Other important operating expenses are for materials&#13;
(fuel expenses and maintenance costs); they vary as a function of traffic volume and represent&#13;
about 30 percent of working expenses). Engineering consultancy costs (close to CFA franc 5.5&#13;
billion for the first five years when the rehabilitation program is carried out) are also a sizable&#13;
operating expense.&#13;
4.17   The Concessionfee paid by the private operator is another important expenditure item.&#13;
It consists of three parts: (i) a percentage of the Concessionaire's operating revenues paid for&#13;
the use of public infrastructure (the share payable is 0 percent of traffic revenue in the first&#13;
year, 2 percent in the second year, and 4 percent annually thereafter) part of it will finance&#13;
operation of the patrimony corporations, part their investment programs, with the remaining&#13;
surplus to be repaid to the Governments; (ii) equipment lease payments, which consist of an&#13;
annual fee calculated according to a formula defined in the Concession Agreement; and (iii)&#13;
debt service payments covering the reimbursement of principal and interest due on external&#13;
financing of the rehabilitation investment program.  Details of the annual concession fee&#13;
payments are shown in ANNEX 4.5&#13;
D.    Project Risks&#13;
4.18   Project risks are manageable and would mainly result from delays in attracting back&#13;
traffic from  road transport.  However, the concessionaire has competent personnel and&#13;
managerial independence in carrying out the program on behalf of the patrimony companies,&#13;
and a financial interest in doing so rapidly and thoroughly. An efficiently run railway would&#13;
have no difficulty to attract back, from road transport in the competing corridors, the heavy&#13;
long-distance traffic its predecessors lost due to poor operational and commercial performance.&#13;
Traffic forecasts underlying the proposed investment program are conservative (500,000 tpy of&#13;
"base" freight traffic by the end of the first three-year period, compared to RAN traffic of&#13;
600,000 tpy in the mid-eighties when service levels were already deteriorating). This reflects&#13;
the assumption that road transport services, which have been underpriced due to the excess&#13;
road transport capacity built through indirect subsidization during the 1980 drought years, will&#13;
only gradually be priced at their correct level, as existing equipment attains the end of its&#13;
useful life and equipment renewal at current prices becomes necessary.&#13;
E.     Project Sustainability&#13;
4.19   Prospects for project sustainability are good.  Based on conservative traffic and&#13;
financial projections, the private operator would start making a modest profit from year 5 of&#13;
operation, when the rehabilitation program  is expected to be fully implemented.   The&#13;
Concession Agreement covers a period of 15 years initially, extendible thereafter for five-year&#13;
intervals. The private concessionaire will have the freedom to adapt to changing economic&#13;
circumstances rapidly and decisively, while the owners maintain basic oversight rights to&#13;
ensure fair competition in the transport services sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F.    Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.20   The bulk of the operations of the project concern rehabilitation of rolling stock and of&#13;
existing rail infrastructure (replacement of rail and sleepers on some sections of the existing&#13;
track, reballasting, and repair of some bridges and culverts). These rehabilitation works are&#13;
unlikely to impact negatively on the environment, since they are carried out on an embankment&#13;
which has been constructed some forty years ago; they will, however, be monitored by the&#13;
Ministry  in  charge  of the  Environment.   Workshop  rehabilitation  will introduce&#13;
environmentally acceptable methods of industrial waste disposal. In addition, the&#13;
Concessionaire has agreed during negotiations to have some of its staff trained in&#13;
environmental assessment and auditing to avoid negative environmental impacts during&#13;
rehabilitation and future operation. Annual reports on the execution of this training program&#13;
will be provided to IDA.&#13;

Table F: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
The ERR calculations depend mainly on four variables: reduction in rail costs, traffic volume, program investment costs and&#13;
rail long -run marginal costs. For each of these variables, respectively, a sensitivity factor has been applied: cost reduction&#13;
factor (CRF), traffic sensitivity factor (TSF), program cost sensitivity factor (PCSF) and transport costs sensitivity factor (TCSF).&#13;
Chart I describes how the ERR varies with different values of traffic volume and program costs; it gives the percentage of traffic&#13;
volume and program costs (compared to the foreseen ones) required to have an ERR higher than a given value: for well estimated&#13;
costs, traffic levels should be higher than 57% of the forecasts to have an ERR higher than 10% and 91% higher than the forecasts&#13;
to have an ERR higher than 20%. Chart 2 describes how ERR varies with traffic volume and rail transport costs .&#13;

ECONOMIC CALCULATION METHODOLOGY&#13;
The economic analysis of the Railway Rehabilitation Program is based on the following parameters:&#13;
D: demand of traffic in the year n (TKm)&#13;
r,,,,: percentage of demand (traffic) served by the railway without the program in year n&#13;
r,,: percentage of demand (traffic) served by the railway with the program in year n&#13;
c: rail transport costs with the program (CFAF/TKm)&#13;
(l+o).c: rail transport costs without the program, oL is a factor that quantifies inefficiencies and high operating&#13;
costs of current rail services (CFAF/TKm)&#13;
c': road transport costs (CFAF/TKm)&#13;
Transport costs are calculated as follows:&#13;

COST DATA USED IN THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.   In the absence of fully-developed railway traffic costing systems for SICF and&#13;
SCFB, economic long-run marginal costs of rail transport have been estimated for the&#13;
main products transported:&#13;
*  national transport of petroleum products between Abidjan and Bouak6&#13;
* international transport of petroleum products between Abidjan and&#13;
Ouagadougou&#13;
*  transport of containers between Abidjan and Ouagadougou&#13;
*  transport of cement between Abidjan and Ouagadougou&#13;
*  transport of clinker between Abidjan and Ouagadougou&#13;
*  transport of manganese between Tambao and Abidjan&#13;
* international passengers transport between Abidjan and Ouagadougou&#13;
Based on partial cost information and mission estimates, these costs represent estimates.&#13;
2.    Economic long-run marginal costs of rail transport are incremental costs incurred&#13;
by the national economy when new traffic is introduced under the assumptions that: (a)&#13;
rail infrastructure is not overloaded (introduction of new traffic does not require&#13;
investment to increase infrastructure capacity) and (b) rail transport equipment&#13;
(locomotives, wagons, coaches) is fully-utilized by existing traffic (introduction of the&#13;
new traffic requires acquisition of new equipment).&#13;
3.    Economic long-run marginal costs for the purpose of the present analysis include&#13;
the following:&#13;
(a)  locomotive costs, composed of fuel and lubricants costs, maintenance (spare&#13;
parts and manpower) costs, and depreciation and interest;&#13;
(b)  wagon (freight traffic) or coach (passenger traffic) costs composed of&#13;
maintenance costs (spare parts and manpower) and depreciation and&#13;
interest;&#13;
(c)  crew costs;&#13;
(d)  miscellaneous operating costs; and&#13;
(e)  infrastructure costs (maintenance of track components).&#13;
4.    For the economic evaluation of the program, estimated "with-program" estimated&#13;
long-run marginal rail costs for the major traffic components are compared with road&#13;
transport costs (shown below), and or "without-program" costs. The detailed calculations&#13;
of estimated long-run marginal costs are in the Project File (Calculations of Long-run&#13;
Marginal Rail Transport Costs for Selected Products).&#13;

            The main objectives of Emergency Railway
            Rehabilitation Project are to contribute to the
            revitalization of a major transport service promoting
            competitiveness and regional integration, by providing the
            financing necessary to carry out the long overdue
            rehabilitation of the publicly-owned railway infrastructure
            and equipment assets. The main components of the project are
            as follows: 1) infrastructure rehabilitation which covers
            selective track renewal and repair, ballasting, bridge and
            culvert repairs, embankment repairs, installation of
            weighing equipment, and some building repairs; 2) equipment
            rehabilitation and acquisition including the motive power
            and rolling stock rehabilitation component, the maintenance
            equipment component, the telecommunication component, and
            the component related to the acquisition of computers; and
            3) works supervision and training.
