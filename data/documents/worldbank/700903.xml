ELECTRIC POWER PRICING POLICY*&#13;
This paper presents a framework for electric power pricing which&#13;
is especially appropriate to the developing countries. It contains a review&#13;
of the basic theory of marginal cost pricing applicable to the power sector,&#13;
and a summary of the current state-of-the-art. The adaptation of the theory&#13;
for practical application in relation to the objectives of power pricing&#13;
policy in the LDC context, results in a two stage procedure for tariff&#13;
setting. First, a set of prices based on the strict long-run marginal costs&#13;
(LFMC) of supply which meet the economic efficiency criterion are computed.&#13;
Second, the strict LRMC is adjusted to arrive at an appropriate realistic&#13;
tariff structure which satisfies various constraints. Explicit models are&#13;
presented which permit modifications to be made to the strict LRMC on the&#13;
basis of: (a) economic-second best considerations (especially with regard&#13;
to the pricing of substitute fuels), and (b) social considerations relating&#13;
to subsidized prices for poor consumers. The tailoring of tariff policy to&#13;
meet sector financial needs and other requirements such as simplicity of&#13;
metering and billing are also discussed.&#13;

ELECTRIC POWER PRICING&#13;

Section A&#13;
Introduction and Overview 1/&#13;
Modern societies have become increasingly dependent on various&#13;
types of energy sources, among which electric power has occupied a dominant&#13;
position. Traditionally, electric power pricing policy in most countries&#13;
has been determined mainly on the basis of financial or accounting criteria,&#13;
e.g.,, raising sufficient sales revenues to meet operating expenses and debt&#13;
service requirements while providing a reasonable contribution towards the&#13;
capital required for future power system expansion.&#13;
However, in recent times several new factors have arisen, including&#13;
the rapid growth of demand, the increase in fuel oil prices and prices of&#13;
fossil fuel and nuclear plant, the dwindling availability of cheaply exploit-&#13;
able hydro-electric resources, and the expansion of power systems into areas&#13;
of loDwer consumer density at relatively high unit costs. These developments&#13;
have led to increasing emphasis being laid on the use of economic principles&#13;
in order to produce and consume electric power efficiently, while conserving&#13;
scarce resources, especially in the developing country context. In partic-&#13;
ular, a great deal of attention has been paid to the use of marginal cost&#13;
pricing policies in the electric power sector.&#13;
1/   This section summarizes basic pricing policy principles developed in&#13;
the EWT Department over the last 6 years, through a program of applied&#13;
research work and country case studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The objectives of power tariff policy in the national context, and&#13;
a pricing framework based on long run marginal costs (LRMC) which meets these&#13;
requirements, are summarized in this section. In Section B, the economic&#13;
principles underlying the LRMC approach are described, and in Section C, a&#13;
framework for calculating strict LRMC is presented. Finally, the process of&#13;
adjusting LRMC to devise a practical tariff structure which meets other&#13;
national constraints is discussed in Section D, followed by several technical&#13;
appendices.&#13;
A.1 Requirements of a Power Tariff&#13;
The modern approach to power pricing recognizes the existence of&#13;
several objectives or criteria, not all of which are mutually consistent.&#13;
First, national economic resources must be allocated efficiently, not only&#13;
among different sectors of the economy, but within the electric power sector&#13;
itself. This implies that cost-reflecting prices must be used to indicate&#13;
to the electricity consumers the true econLomic costs of supplying their&#13;
specific needs, so that supply and demand can be matched efficiently.&#13;
Second, certain principles relating to fairness and equity must&#13;
be satisfied, including: (a) the fair allocation of costs among consumers&#13;
according to the burdens they impose on the system; (b) the ensuring of a&#13;
reasonable degree of price stability and avoiding large fluctuations in price&#13;
from year to year; and (c) the provision of a minimum level of service to&#13;
persons who may not be able to afford the full cost.&#13;
Third, the power prices should raise sufficient revenues to meet&#13;
the financial requirements of the sector, as described earlier.  Fourth, the&#13;
power tariff structure must be simple enough to facilitate the metering and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
billing of customers. Fifth and finally, other economic and political&#13;
requirements must also be considered, e.g., subsidized electricity supply to&#13;
certain sectors to enhance growth, or to certain geographic areas for pur-&#13;
poses of regional development.&#13;
Since the above criteria are often in conflict with one another, it&#13;
is necessary to accept certain trade-offs between them.  The LRMC approach to&#13;
price setting described below has both the analytical rigor and inherent&#13;
flexibility to provide a tariff structure which is responsive to these basic&#13;
objectives.&#13;
A.2 Long Run Marginal Costs (LRMC) Based Tariffs&#13;
A tariff based on LRMC is consistent with the first objective, i.e.,&#13;
the efficient allocation of resources. The traditional accounting approach is&#13;
concerned with the recovery of sunk costs, whereas in the LRMC calculation it&#13;
is the amount of future resources used or saved by consumer decisions which is&#13;
important. Since prices are the amounts paid for increments of consumption,&#13;
in general they should reflect the incremental cost thereby incurred. Supply&#13;
costs increase if existing consumers increase their demand or if new consumers&#13;
are connected to the system. Therefore, prices which act as a signal to&#13;
consumers should be related to the economic value of resources to be used in&#13;
the future, to meet such consumption changes. The accounting approach which&#13;
uses historical assets and embedded costs implies that future economic re-&#13;
sources will be as cheap or as expensive as in the past. This could lead to&#13;
over-investment and waste, or under-investment and the additional costs of&#13;
unnecessary scarcity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
In order to promote better utilization of capacity, and to avoid&#13;
unnecessary investments to meet peak demands (which tend to grow very&#13;
rapidly), the LRMC approach permits the structuring of prices so that they&#13;
vary according to the marginal costs of serving demands:&#13;
-    by different consumer categories;&#13;
-    in different seasons;&#13;
-    at different hours of the day;&#13;
-    by different voltage levels;&#13;
-    in different geographical areas; and so on.&#13;
In particular, with an appropriate choice of the peak period, struc-&#13;
turing the LRMC based tariffs by time-of-day generally leads to the conclusion&#13;
that peak consumers should pay both capacity and energy costs, whereas off-&#13;
peak consumers need to pay only the energy costs. Similarly, analysis of LRMC&#13;
by voltage level usually indicates that the lower the service voltage, the&#13;
greater the costs imposed on the system by consumers.&#13;
The structuring of LRMC based tariffs also meets sub-categories (a)&#13;
and (b) of the second (or fairness) objective. The economic resource costs&#13;
of future consumption are allocated as far as possible among the customers&#13;
according to the incremental costs they impose on the power system. In the&#13;
traditional approach, fairness was often defined rather narrowly and led to&#13;
the allocation of (arbitrary) accounting costs to various consumers. Because&#13;
the LRMC method deals with future costs over a long period, e.g., about 10&#13;
years, the resulting prices (in constant terms) tend to be quite stable over&#13;
time. This smoothing out of costs over a long period is especially important&#13;
because of capital indivisibilities or lumpiness of power system investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
The use of economic opportunity costs (or shadow prices, especially&#13;
for capital, labor, and fuel) instead of purely financial costs, and the&#13;
consideration of externalities whenever possible, also underline the links&#13;
between the LRMC method and efficient resource allocation.&#13;
The development of LRMC based tariff structures which also meet the&#13;
other objectives of pricing policy mentioned earlier, are discussed below.&#13;
A.3 Practical Tariff Setting&#13;
The first stage of the LRMC approach is the calculation of pure or&#13;
strict LRMC which reflect the economic efficiency criterion. If price was&#13;
set strictly equal to LRMC, consmers could indicate their willingness-to-pay&#13;
for more consumption, thus signalling the justification of further investment&#13;
to expand capacity.&#13;
In the second stage of tariff setting, ways are sought in which the&#13;
strict LRMC may be adjusted to meet the other objectives, among which the&#13;
most important one is the financial requirement. If prices were set equal&#13;
to strict LRMC, it is likely that there will be a financi4l surplus. This&#13;
is because marginal costs tend to be higher than average costs, during a&#13;
period when the unit costs of supply are increasing.  In principle, financial&#13;
surpluses of the utility may be taxed away by the state, but in practice the&#13;
use of power pricing as a tool for raising central government revenues is&#13;
usually politically unpopular and rarely applied. However, such surplus&#13;
revenues can also be disposed of in a manner which is consistent with the&#13;
other objectives. For example, the connection charges can be subsidized&#13;
without violating the LRMC price, or low income consumers could be provided&#13;
with a subsidized block of electricity to meet their basic requirement, thus&#13;
satisfying socio-political objectives. Conversely, if as in some cases,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
marginal costs are below average costs (e.g., due to economies of scale),&#13;
then pricing at the strict LRMC will lead to a financial deficit, which will&#13;
have to be made up,for example, by higher lump sum connection charges, flat&#13;
rate charges, or even government subsidies.&#13;
Another reason for deviating from the strict LRMC arises because&#13;
of second-best considerations. When prices elsewhere in the economy do not&#13;
reflect marginal costs, especially in the case of substitutes and complements&#13;
for electric power, then departures from the strict marginal cost pricing&#13;
rule for electricity services would be justified. For example, in rural&#13;
areas alternative energy may be available cheaply in the form of subsidized&#13;
kerosene and/or firewood. In this case, pricing electricity below the LRMC&#13;
may be justified, to prevent excessive use of the alternative forms of energy.&#13;
Similarly, if incentives are provided for the importation of private gener-&#13;
ators, while their fuel is also subsidized, then charging the full marginal&#13;
cost to industrial consumers may encourage them to purchase captive power&#13;
plant, which is economically less efficient from the national viewpoint.&#13;
Since the computation of strict LRMC is based on the power utilities' least&#13;
cost expansion program, LRMC may also need to be modified by short term con-&#13;
siderations if previously unforeseen events render the long run system plan&#13;
sub-optimal in the short run. Typical examples include a sudden reduction&#13;
in demand growth and a large excess of installed capacity which may justify&#13;
somewhat reduced capacity charges, or a rapid increase in fuel prices, which&#13;
could warrant a short term fuel surcharge.&#13;
As discussed earlier, the LRMC approach permits a high degree of&#13;
tariff structuring. However, data constraints and the objective of simpli-&#13;
fying metering and billing procedure usually requires that there should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a practical limit to differentiation of tariffs by: (a) major customer cate-&#13;
gories (e.g., residential, industrial, commercial, special, rural etc.);&#13;
(b) voltage levels (e.g., high, medium and low); (c) time-of-day (e.g., peak,&#13;
off.-take); (d) geographic region, etc. Finally, various other constraints&#13;
also may be incorporated into the LRMC based tariff, such as the political&#13;
requirement of having a uniform national tariff, subsidizing rural electrifi-&#13;
cation, and so on. However, in each case, such deviations from LRMC will&#13;
impose an efficiency cost on the economy.&#13;
A.4 Summary&#13;
To summarize, in the first stage of calculating LRMC, the economic&#13;
(first best) efficiency objectives of tariff setting are satisfied, because&#13;
the method of calculation is based on future economic resource costs (rather&#13;
than sunk costs), and also incorporates economic considerations such as shadow&#13;
prices and externalities. The structuring of marginal costs permits an effi-&#13;
cient and fair allocation of the tariff burden on consumers. In the second&#13;
stage of developing a LRMC based tariff, deviations from strict LRMC are&#13;
considered, to meet important financial and other social, economic (second-&#13;
best) and political criteria. This second step of adjusting strict LRMC is&#13;
generally as important as the first stage calculation, especially in the&#13;
developing country context.&#13;
The LRMC approach provides an explicit framework for analyzing&#13;
system costs and setting tariffs. If departures from the strict LRMC are&#13;
required for non-economic reasons, then the economic efficiency cost of these&#13;
deviations may be estimated even on a rough basis, by comparing the impact&#13;
of the modified tariff relative to (benchmark) strict LRMC. Furthermore&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
since the cost structure may be studied in consideral e detail during the&#13;
LRMC calculations, this analysis helps to pinpoint w aknesses and ineffi-&#13;
ciencies in the various parts of the power system, e.g., overinvestment,&#13;
unbalanced investment, or excessive losses, at the generation, transmission&#13;
and distribution levels, in different geographic areas, and so on. This&#13;
aspect is particularly useful in improving system expansion planning.&#13;
Finally, any LRMC based tariff is a compromise between many dif-&#13;
ferent objectives. Therefore, there is no "ideal" tariff. By using the LRMC&#13;
approach, it is possible to revise and improve the tariff on a consistent and&#13;
ongoing basis, and thereby approach the optimum price over a period of several&#13;
years, without subjecting long-standing consumers to "unfair" shocks, in the&#13;
form of large abrupt price changes.&#13;

Economics of Marginal Cost Pricing&#13;
The origins of m,rginal cost pricing theory date back as far as the&#13;
path,breakiag efforts of Dupuit and subsequently Hotelling; Ruggles provides&#13;
a comprehensive review of work in this area up to the 1940's. 1/ The devel-&#13;
opment of the theory, especially for application in the electric power sector,&#13;
received a strong impetus from the work of Boiteux, Steiner, and others, from&#13;
the 1950's onwards. 2/ Recernt work has led to more sophisticated investment&#13;
models which permit determination of marginal costs, developments in peak load&#13;
pricing, consideration of the effects of uncertainty and the costs of power&#13;
shortages, and so on. 3/&#13;

This section consists of a review of the basic economic principles&#13;
of marginal cost pricing and a summary of the current state-of-the-art.&#13;
Further details of the theory may be found in the references given earlier.&#13;
B.1 Basic Marginal Cost Theory&#13;
The rationale for setting price equal to marginal cost may be&#13;
clarified with the simple supply-demand diagram shown in Figure B.1. Let&#13;
EFGD0 be the demand curve (which determines the kWh of electricity demanded&#13;
per year, at any given average price level), while AGS is the supply curve&#13;
(represented by the marginal cost MC of supplying additional units of output).&#13;
At the price p, and demand Q, the total benefit of consumption is&#13;
represented by the consumers willingness-to-pay, i.e., the area under the&#13;
demand curve OEFJ. The cost of supplying the output is the area under supply&#13;
curve OAHJ. Therefore, the net benefit,,or total benefit minus supply cost, is&#13;
given by the area AEFH. Clearly, the maximum net benefit AEG is achieved when&#13;
price is set equal to marginal cost at the optimum market clearing point G,&#13;
i.e., (Po,Q0).&#13;
In mathematical terms, the net benefit is given by:&#13;
NV 13  fpJ     jNI MC(d.&#13;
0 &#13;
Where p(Q) and MC(Q) are the equations of the demand and supply curves respec-&#13;
tively maximizing NB yields:   i (NM) /d Q  :b (Q) - M  C (4)   0&#13;
which is the point of intersection of the demand and marginal cost curves&#13;
(Po9Q0).&#13;
The analysis so far has been static, and therefore we now consider&#13;
the dynamic effect of growth of demand from year 0 to year 1, which leads to&#13;
an outward shift in the demand curve from D  to D .  Assuming that the correct&#13;
o     1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
market clearing price p  was prevailing in year 0, excess demand equal to GK&#13;
wil:L occur in year 1.  Ideally, the supply should be increased to Q1 and the&#13;
new optimum market clearing price established at p1.  However, the available&#13;
information concerning the demand curve D may be incomplete, making it diffi-&#13;
1&#13;
cull: to locate the point L.&#13;
Fortunately, the technical relationships underlying the production&#13;
function usually permit the marginal cost curve to be determined more accu-&#13;
rately. Therefore, as a first step, the supply may be increased to an inter-&#13;
mediate level Q', at the price p'. Observation of the excess demand MN indi-&#13;
cates that both the supply and the marginal cost price should be further&#13;
increased. Conversely, if we overshoot L and end up in a situation of excess&#13;
supply, then it may be necessary to wait until the growth of demand catches&#13;
up with the over-capacity. In this iterative manner, it is possible to move&#13;
along the marginal cost curve towards the optimum market clearing point. It&#13;
should be noted that, as we approach it, the optimum is also shifting with&#13;
demand growth, and therefore we may never hit this moving target. However,&#13;
the basic rule of setting price equal to the marginal cost and expanding&#13;
supply until the market clears, is still valid. 1/&#13;
1/   This simple rule has to be modified when there are constraints in the&#13;
economy; in particular, the consequences of shadow pricing of inputs,&#13;
second best considerations, and subsidized social prices for poor&#13;
consumers, are clarified in Appendix 2.&#13;

B.2 Capital Indivisibilities and Peak Load Pricing&#13;
Next, the effect of capital indivisibilities or lumpiness of invest-&#13;
ments, is examined with the help of Figure B.2. This analysis recognizes the&#13;
fact that,owing to economies of scale, capacity additions to power systems&#13;
(especially generation) tend to be large and long-lived. Suppose that in&#13;
year 0, the maximum supply capacity is Q, while the optimum price and output&#13;
combination (p , Q ) prevails, corresponding to the demand curve D  and the&#13;
short run marginal cost curve SRMC (e.g., fuel, operating and maintenance&#13;
costs). Now if capacity is to be increased from Q to Q, there will be a sharp&#13;
spike in the marginal cost curve.&#13;
As demand grows from D  to D1 over time, the price must be increased&#13;
to p1  to clear the market.  When the demand curve has shifted to D2 and the&#13;
price is p2, plant is added on to increase the capacity to Q.  However, as&#13;
soon as the capacity increment is completed and becomes a sunk cost, SRMC&#13;
falls to its old trend line.  Therefore, p3 is the optimum price corresponding&#13;
to demand D3.  Generally, the large price fluctuations during this process&#13;
will be unacceptable to consumers. This practical problem may be avoided by&#13;
adopting a long run marginal cost (LRMC) approach, and recognizing the need&#13;
for peak load pricing, as described below.&#13;
The basic peak load pricing model shown in Figure B.3 has two demand&#13;
curves; for example,D k could represent the peak demand during the x daylight&#13;
and evening hours of the day when electric loads are large, while D   would&#13;
op&#13;
irLdicate the off-peak demand during the remaining (24-x) hours when loads are&#13;
light. The marginal cost curve is simplified assuming a single type of plant&#13;
with the fuel, operating and maintenance costs given by the constant a, and&#13;

the LRMC of adding to capacity (e.g., investment costs suitably annuitized&#13;
and distributed over the lifetime output of the plant) given by the constant&#13;
b. The static diagram has been drawn to indicate that the pressure on&#13;
capacity arises due to peak demand D k' while the off-peak demand D   does&#13;
not infringe on the capacity Q. The optimum pricing rule now has two parts&#13;
corresponding to two distinct rating periods (i.e., differentiated by the&#13;
time of day);&#13;
peak period price        ppk = a + b&#13;
off-peak period price:  p   5 a&#13;
The logic of this simple result is that peak period users, who are the cause&#13;
of capacity additions, should bear full responsibility for the capacity costs&#13;
as well as fuel, operating and maintenance costs, while off-peak consumers&#13;
only pay the latter costs (see also Appendix 1).&#13;
B.3 Extensions of Simple Models&#13;
The models presented so far have been deliberately idealized and&#13;
simplified to clarify the basic principles involved. Extensions of these&#13;
models which incorporate and analyze the economics of real-world power systems&#13;
more realistically are reviewed below.&#13;
First, the usual procedure adopted in marginal cost pricing studies&#13;
may require some iteration. Typically, a long-range demand forecast is made&#13;
assuming some given future evolution of prices, a least cost system expansion&#13;
plan is determined to meet this demand, and LRMC is computed on the basis of&#13;
latter. However, if the estimated LRMC which is to be imposed on consumers is&#13;
significantly different from the original assumption regarding the evolution&#13;
of prices, then the first round LRMC estimates must be fed back into the&#13;
model to revise the demand forecast and repeat the LRMC calculation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
In theory, this iterative procedure could be repeated until future&#13;
demand, prices, and LRKC estimates become mutually self-consistent. In&#13;
practice, uncertainties in price elasticities of demand and other data may&#13;
dictate a more pragmatic approach in which the LRMC results would be used&#13;
to devise power tariffs after only one iteration. The behavior of demand is&#13;
then observed over some time period and the LRMC re-estimated and tariffs&#13;
revised to move closer to the optimum, which may itself have shifted meanwhile,&#13;
as described in subsection B.1. The price feedback effects are most important&#13;
in the so-called shifting peak case, when peak load pricing may shift the&#13;
demand peak from one rating period to another. In general, problems arising&#13;
from changes in the level of demand at any given time of day due to differen-&#13;
tial pricing during other rating periods have been recognized, and are being&#13;
investigated.&#13;
Second, the interrelated issues of supply and demand uncertainty,&#13;
reserve margins, and costs of shortages raise certain problems. The least&#13;
cost system expansion plan to meet the demand forecast is generally deter-&#13;
mined assuming some (arbitrary) target level of system reliability (e.g.,&#13;
loss-of-load-probability or LOLP, reserve margin, etc.)   Therefore, marginal&#13;
costs depend on the target reliability level, when in fact economic theory&#13;
suggests that reliability should also be treated as a variable to be optimized,&#13;
and both price and capacity (or equivalently, reliability) levels should be&#13;
optimized simultaneously. The optimum price is the marginal cost price as&#13;
described earlier, while the optimum reliability level is achieved when the&#13;
marginal cost of capacity additions (to improve the reserve margin) are equal&#13;
to the expected value of economic cost savings to consumers due to electricity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
supply shortages averted by those capacity increments. These considerations&#13;
lead to a more generalized approach to system expansion planning as shown&#13;
below. 1/&#13;
Consider a simple expression for the net benefits (NB) of elec-&#13;
tric:ity consumption, which is to be maximized:&#13;
NB(D,R) = TB(D) - SC(D,R) - OC(D,R)&#13;
where TB = total benefits of consumption if there were no outages; SC = supply&#13;
costs (i.e., system costs); OC = outage costs (i.e., costs to consumers of&#13;
suplply shortages); D = demand; and R = reliability.&#13;
In the traditional approach to system planning both D and R are&#13;
exogenously fixed, and therefore NB is maximized, when SC is minimized, i.e.,&#13;
least cost system expansion planning. However, if R is treated as a variable:&#13;
d(Na) W -a  (S Ct + o                   (ra--)s+-oc). !b  = o&#13;
is the necessary first order maximization condition.&#13;
Assuming    a,               elds :       sC)  5 _ -CR&#13;
Therefore, as described earlier, reliability should be increased by&#13;
adding to capacity until the above condition is satisfied. An alternative&#13;
way of expressing this result is that since TB is independent of R, NB is&#13;
maximized when total costs: TC = (SC + OC) are minimized. The above&#13;
criterion is one which effectively subsumes the traditional system planning&#13;
rule of minimizing only the system costs. 2/&#13;

2/   The emphasis on outage costs requires greater effort to measure these&#13;
costs; see M. Munasinghe and M. Gellerson, Economic Criteria for&#13;

nomics, vol. 10 (Spring 1979); and M. Munasinghe, "The Costs of Elec-&#13;
tric Power Shortages to Residential Consumers," Journal of Consumer&#13;
Economics (forthcoming).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Third, some problems are raised by the dichotomy of having to choose&#13;
between short and long run marginal costs, i.e., SRMC versus LRMC. The short-&#13;
run (SRMC) may be defined as the cost of meeting additional electricity con-&#13;
sumption, with capacity fixed, while the long run marginal cost (LRMC) is the&#13;
cost of providing an increase in consumption (sustained indefinitely into the&#13;
future) in a situation where optimal capacity adjustments are possible. When&#13;
the system is optimally planned and operated (i.e., capacity and reliability&#13;
are optimal), SRMC and LRMC coincide. However, if the system plan is sub-&#13;
optimal, significant deviations between SRMC and LRMC will have to be resolved&#13;
within the pricing policy framework. Finally, if there are substantial out-&#13;
age costs outside the peak period, then the optimal marginal capacity costs&#13;
may be allocated among the different rating periods in proportion to the&#13;
corresponding marginal costs. 1/&#13;
B.4 Shadow Pricing&#13;
In the idealized world of perfect competition the interaction of&#13;
atomistic profit maximizing procedures and atomistic utility maximizing con-&#13;
sumers gives rise to a situation that is called pareto-optimal. In this&#13;
state, prices reflect the true marginal social costs, scarce resources are&#13;
efficiently allocated, and for a given income distribution, no one person&#13;
can be made better off without making someone else worse off. 2/&#13;
1/   It has been suggested that capacity costs should be allocated to dif-&#13;
ferent rating periods in inverse proportion to LOLP, but this would be&#13;
unsatisfactory because aggregate reliability indices such as LOLP are&#13;
poor proxies for pro-rating outage costs.&#13;
2/   See for example:  E. J. Mishan, Cost Benefit Analysis, Praeger, New York&#13;
(1976) part vii.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
However, conditions are likely to be far from ideal in the real&#13;
world. Distortions due to monopoly practices, external economies and dis-&#13;
economies (which are not internalized in the private market), interventions&#13;
in the market process through taxes, import duties and subsidies, etc., all&#13;
result in market (or financial) prices for goods and services, which may&#13;
divrerge substantially from their shadow prices or true economic values. More-&#13;
over, if there are large income disparities, the passive acceptance of the&#13;
existing skewed income distribution, which is implied by the reliance on&#13;
strict efficiency criteria for determining economic welfare, may be socially&#13;
and politically unacceptable. Such considerations necessitate the use of&#13;
appropriate shadow prices (instead of marklet prices) of inputs to the elec-&#13;
trLcity sector, to determine the optimal investment program as well as LRMC,&#13;
eslpecially in the developing countries where market distortions are more&#13;
prevalent.&#13;
The basic concepts of shadow pricing are summarized below, with&#13;
special reference to so called efficiency (shadow) prices which emphasize effi-&#13;
cient resource allocation and neglect income distributional considerations. 1/&#13;
In order to derive a consistent set of shadow prices for goods and&#13;
services it is necessary to adopt a common yardstick or numeraire to measure&#13;
economic value. For example, a rupee's (or dollar's) worth of a certain good&#13;
purchased in a duty free shop is likely to be more than the physical quantity&#13;
1/   For details including a discussion of social shadow prices which incorpo-&#13;
rate income distributional effects, see: M. Munasinghe and J. J. Warford,&#13;

of the same good obtained for one rupee (or one dollar) in a retail store,&#13;
after import duties and taxes have been levied. Therefore, it is possible to&#13;
intuitively distinguish between a border priced rupee, which is used in inter-&#13;
national markets free of import tariffs, and a domestic priced rupee, which&#13;
is used in the domestic market subject to various distortions. A more sophis-&#13;
ticated example of the value differences of a currency unit in various uses&#13;
arises in countries where the aggregate investment for future economic growth&#13;
is considered inadequate. In such a case, a rupee of savings (which could be&#13;
invested to increase the level of future consumption) may be considered more&#13;
valuable in the national context than a rupee devoted to current consumption.&#13;
One numeraire that has proved to be most appropriate in many in-&#13;
stances is a unit of uncommitted public income at border prices, which is&#13;
essentially the same as freely disposable foreign exchange available to the&#13;
government, but expressed in terms of units of local currency converted at the&#13;
official exchange rate. 1/ Therefore, the discussion in the next section is&#13;
developed in terms of this particular yardstick of value. The border priced&#13;
numeraire is particularly relevant for the foreign-exchange scarce developing&#13;
countries, and represents the set of opportunities available to a country to&#13;
purchase goods and services on the international market. The numeraire and&#13;
shadow prices are in real terms, i.e., net of inflation.&#13;
The estimation and use of shadow prices is facilitated by dividing&#13;
economic resources into tradable and non-tradable items. The values of&#13;

sumption is advocated in: P. Dasgupta, A. Sen and S. Marglin, Guidelines&#13;

directly imported or exported goods and services are already known in terms&#13;
of their border prices, i.e., their foreign exchange costs, converted at the&#13;
official exchange rate. However, locally purchased items whose values are&#13;
known only in terms of domestic market prices, need to be converted to border&#13;
shadow prices by multiplying the former prices by appropriate conversion&#13;
factors (CF). 1/ The free trade assumption is not required to justify the&#13;
use of border prices since domestic price distortions are, in effect, adjusted&#13;
by netting out all taxes, duties and subsidies.&#13;
The most important tradable inputs used in the electric power sector&#13;
are capital goods and petroleum-based fuels; in each case world market or&#13;
border prices (c.i.f. for imports and f.o.b. for exports) may be used as&#13;
shadow prices where appropriate. In some countries other fuels, such as coal&#13;
deposits, are available, for which there may be no clear-cut alternative (ex-&#13;
port) market. In these cases, the marginal social cost (MSC) of production&#13;
e.g., resource cost of extracting the coal, may be used. The most important&#13;
non-tradable primary factor inputs are labor and land, which are discussed&#13;
later. The shadow prices of other non-tradable goods and services from many&#13;
sectors can be determined in terms of their MSC through appropriate decompo-&#13;
sition. For example, suppose one rupee's worth (in domestic market prices)&#13;
of the output of the domestic construction sector may be broken down succes-&#13;
sLvely into n components (such as capital, labor, materials, etc.), which&#13;
are themselves valued at rupees a1, a2, ..., a  (in terms of border prices).&#13;
1t   In the subsequent discussion the pair of terms:  border and shadow&#13;
prices, will be used synonymously, as well as the pair: domestic and&#13;
market prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Since the conversion factor of any good is defined as the ratio of the border&#13;
price to domestic price, the construction conversion factor equals:&#13;
In the case of non-tradables which are not important enough to&#13;
merit individual attention, or lack sufficient data, the standard conversion&#13;
factor (SCF) may be used. The SCF is equal to the official exchange rate&#13;
(OER) divided by the more familiar shadow exchange rate (SER), appropriately&#13;
defined. Conversion of domestic priced values into border price equivalents&#13;
by application of the SCF to the former, is conceptually the inverse of the&#13;
traditional practice of multiplying foreign currency costs by the SER (instead&#13;
of the OER), to convert to the domestic price equivalent. A convenient&#13;
approximation to the standard conversion factor is the ratio of the official&#13;
exchange rate to the free trade exchange rate (FTER), when the country is&#13;
moving toward a freer trade regime. This estimate of the SCF therefore&#13;
reflects the average level of import duties and exports subsidies, and is&#13;
usually less than unity.&#13;
Consider a typical case of unskilled labor in a labor surplus&#13;
country, e.g., rural workers employed for dam construction. The foregone&#13;
output of workers used in the electric power sector is the dominant component&#13;
of the shadow wage rate (SWR). Complications arise because the original rural&#13;
income earned may not reflect the marginal product of agricultural labor, and&#13;
furthermore, for every new job created, more than one rural worker may give up&#13;
his former employment. Allowance must also be made for seasonality of activi-&#13;
ties such as harvesting. In theory, if the laborer has to work harder in a&#13;
new job than before, then the disutility of foregone leisure should be included&#13;
in the SWR, but in practice this component is ignored. Overhead costs incurred,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
such as transportation expenses, should also be considered. The foregoing&#13;
may be summarized by the following basic equation for the efficiency shadow&#13;
wage rate:&#13;
ESWR - a.m + c.u&#13;
where m and u are the foregone marginal output and overhead costs of labor&#13;
in domestic prices, and a and c are corresponding conversion factors to&#13;
convert these values into border prices.&#13;
In the case of land inputs, the appropriate shadow value placed on&#13;
this primary factor depends on its location. In most cases, it is assumed&#13;
that the market price of urban land is a good indicator of its economic&#13;
value in domestic prices, and the application of an appropriate conversion&#13;
factor, e.g., the SCF, to this domestic price will yield the border price&#13;
cost of urban land inputs. Rural land which has an alternative use in agri-&#13;
culture may be valued at its opportunity cost, i.e., the net benefit of fore-&#13;
gone agricultural output. The marginal social cost of other rural land is&#13;
usually assumed to be negligible, unless there is a specific reason to the&#13;
contrary, e.g., the flooding of virgin jungle because of a hydroelectric&#13;
dam may involve the loss of valuable timber or spoilage of a recreational&#13;
area which has commercial potential&#13;
The shadow price of capital is usually reflected in the discount&#13;
rate or accounting rate of interest (ARI), which is defined as the rate of&#13;
decline in the value of the numeraire over time. In practice the opportunity&#13;
cost of capital (OCC) may be used as a proxy for the ARI, in the pure effi-&#13;
ciency price regime. The OCC is defined as the expected value of the annual&#13;
stream of consumption (in border prices), net of replacement, which is yielded&#13;
by the investment of one unit of public income, at the margin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
If the LRMC is calculated by shadow pricing the inputs using&#13;
border prices, it is necessary to make a further adjustment to convert this&#13;
shadow priced LRMC into an equivalent optimal electricity price which will&#13;
be perceived and interpreted by consumers like any other domestic market&#13;
price. Thus, if only economic efficiency considerations are considered, a&#13;
typical expression for the optimal market price based on LRMC would be:&#13;
Pe*  =  (MCBe/b)&#13;
As explained in Appendix 2, the value of b for a given consumer&#13;
group depends on the expenditure pattern of these electricity users, and&#13;
therefore  it is possible to have different prices p * for various categories&#13;
of electricity consumers, e.g., residential, industrial, etc., based on the&#13;
same value of MCB . However, it may sometimes be simpler to use an economy&#13;
wide average value of b, such as the SCF, for all electricity consumers, espe-&#13;
cially when detailed information on different consumer categories is unavail-&#13;
able. In such a case, since SCF &lt; 1 usually, the optimal market price is&#13;
greater than the border priced LRMC, i.e., p e* &gt; MCB . 1/&#13;
1/   A simple numerical example will illustrate this point.  Suppose that&#13;
based on the world import price for high speed diesel fuel and the&#13;
running costs of peaking gas turbines, the border priced LRMC of peak&#13;
period energy is MCB = Pesos 1.6 per kWh, i.e., USJ8 per kWh times the&#13;
official exchange rate (OER) of Pesos 20 per US$. Let the appropriate&#13;
shadow exchange rate (SER) which reflects the average level of import&#13;
duties and export subsidies (e.g., FTER) be Pesos 25 per US$. There-&#13;
fore SCF = OER/SER = 0.8 and the optimal market price for peak period&#13;
energy: pe* = 1.6/0.8 = Pesos 2 per kWh.&#13;

Section C&#13;
Calculating Strict LRMC&#13;
Strict LRMC may be defined broadly as the incremental cost of&#13;
cptimum adjustments in the system expansion plan and system operations&#13;
attributable to an incremental demand increase which is sustained into the&#13;
future. 1/  However, LRMC must be evaluated within a disaggregated frame-&#13;
work. This structuring of LRMC is based chiefly on technical grounds and&#13;
may include: differentiation of marginal costs by time of day, voltage level,&#13;
geographic area, season of the year, and so on. The degree of structuring&#13;
ancl sophis-ication of the LRMC calculation depends on data constraints and&#13;
the useftul.ess of the results, given the practical problems of computing and&#13;
applying a complex tariff; e.g., in theory, the LRMC of each individual&#13;
cornsumer at each moment of time, may be estimated.&#13;
The calculation of strict LRMC is discussed below, 4,tih the struc-&#13;
turing framework limited to one which is of operational val,e I4 a typical&#13;
developing country.  Points at which the computation may be pMrsued at a more&#13;
sophisticated level are indicated in the text. The methoaciogy u. computing&#13;

lump of costs or demand, since the term marginal is often itlterpreted in&#13;

In the present context, both words may be used interchangeably, tq d-enote&#13;

LRMC is summarized but no attempt has been made to present a complete case&#13;
study, because of space limitations. 1/&#13;
C.1 Cost Categories and Rating Periods&#13;
Three broad categories of marginal costs may be identified for&#13;
purposes of the LRMC calculations: capacity costs, energy costs and con-&#13;
sumer costs. Marginal capacity costs are basically the investment costs of&#13;
generation, transmission and distribution facilities associated with supplying&#13;
additional kW. Marginal energy costs are the fuel and operating costs of&#13;
providing additional kWh. Marginal customer costs are the incremental costs&#13;
directly attributable to consumers including costs of hook-up, metering and&#13;
billing. Wherever appropriate, these elements of LRMC must be structured by&#13;
time of day, voltage level and so on, as mentioned earlier.&#13;
The first step in structuring is the selection of appropriate rating&#13;
periods. By examining the system load duration curves, it is possible to&#13;
determine periods during which demand presses on capacity, e.g., at a partic-&#13;
ular time of day, or in a given season of the year. To clarify the following&#13;
presentation, we make the simplifying assumptions that the system under study&#13;
does not exhibit marked seasonability of demand (or supply, where hydro gen-&#13;
eration is involved), and that these are only two rating periods by time-of-&#13;
1/   Several recent case studies are available, involving LRMC calculations in&#13;
a variety of situations including: R. Turvey and D. Anderson, Electricity&#13;
Economics, op.cit.; C. J. Cicchetti, W. J. Gillen and P. Smolensky, The&#13;

day, i.e., peak and off-peak. 1/ Other aspects of structuring will be intro-&#13;
duced later during the analysis.&#13;
C.2 Marginal Capacity Costs&#13;
Consider Figure C.1 which shows the typical annual load duration&#13;
curve (LDC) for the system ABEF in the starting year 0, as well as the two&#13;
rating periods: peak and off-peak. As demand grows over time, the LDC&#13;
increases in magnitude, and the resultant forecast of peak demand is given&#13;
by the curve D in Figure C.2, starting from the initial value MW . The LRMC&#13;
of capacity may be determined by asking the following question: what is the&#13;
change in system capacity costs AC associated with a sustained increment AD&#13;
in the long run peak demand (as shown by the shaded area of Figure C.1 and&#13;
the broken line D + AD in Figure C.2). Consequently, the LRMC of generation&#13;
would be ( ' C), where the increment of demand AD is marginal both in time,&#13;
and in terms of MW. 2/&#13;
1/   If the duration of the peak period is defined too narrowly, peak-load&#13;
pricing is more likely to cause a shift in the peak to the off-peak&#13;
period (see also sub-section B.3). For a review of the application and&#13;
results of peak load pricing policies in European countries, see:&#13;
B. M. Mitchell, W. G. Manning, Jr., and J. P. Acton, Peak Load Pricing,&#13;
Balliner Publ. Co., Cambridge, Mass. (1978). Some very recent results&#13;
of time-of-day pricing studies in the U.S. are given in: A. K. Miedama,&#13;
S. B. White, C. A. Clayton and D. P. Lifson, "Analysis of Experimental&#13;
Time of Use Electricity Prices," Tenth Annual Conference on Current&#13;
Issues in Public Utility Regulation, Williamsburg, Va. (December 1978),&#13;
Research Triangle Institute, North Carolina.&#13;
2/   In theory, AD can be either positive or negative, and generally the&#13;
ratio ( AC/ AD) will vary with the sign as well as the magnitude of AD.&#13;
If many such values of ( AC/ AD) are computed, it is possible to average&#13;
them to obtain LRMC.  However, the easiest procedure would be to consider&#13;
only a single representative positive increment of demand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
In an optimally planned system, the change in the expansion program&#13;
to meet the new incremental load wouJ.d normally consist of advancing the&#13;
commissioning date of future plant or inserting new units such as gas turbines&#13;
or peaking hydro plant (see Figure C.2). If system planning is carried out&#13;
using a computerized model, it is relatively easy to determine the change in&#13;
capacity costs AC by simulating the expansion path and system operation, with&#13;
and without the demand increment AD. 1/ Even if such a computer model is&#13;
unavailable, it is usually possible to use simple considerations to derive&#13;
marginal capacity costs. For example, suppose gas turbines are used for&#13;
peaking; then the required LRMC of generating capacity (LRMC   n  C   ) is the&#13;
cost of advancing 1 kW of gas turbines, which may be estimated in terms of&#13;
the cost per kW installed, annuitized over the expected lifetime. This figure&#13;
must be adjusted for the reserve margin (RM%) and losses due to station use&#13;
(L  %). Thus, a typical expression would be:&#13;
LRMC4ve  C&amp;~. = { A05tP         A} . (I + RM/IIo)|(I  -  L/O/ioO)&#13;
In our simple model, all capacity costs are to be charged.to peak&#13;
period consumers. 2/  Therefore, if the capacity costs of base load generating&#13;
units are to be included in the calculations,it is very important to net out&#13;
potential fuel savings due to displacement of less efficient plant by these&#13;
1/   If a more sophisticated tariff structure having more rating periods is&#13;
used, then the LRMC in any rating period may be estimated by simulating&#13;
the computerized system expansion model with a sustained load increment&#13;
added to the LDC during that period, i.e., just as in the case of the&#13;
peak period analysis.&#13;
2/   As discussed in Section B.3, if expected outage costs are significant&#13;
in a rating period outside the peak period, then it is possible to&#13;
allocate marginal capacity costs over several rating periods.&#13;

new base load units. 1/ The rationale underlying this conclusion is clarified&#13;
in Appendix 1, using a simplified system model.&#13;
Next, the LRMC of transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) are calcu-&#13;
lated. Generally, all T&amp;D investment costs are allocated to incremental&#13;
capacity, because the designs of these facilities are determined principally&#13;
by the peak kW that they carry rather than the kWh. 2/ The concept of struc-&#13;
turing by voltage level may be introduced at this stage. Consider three supply&#13;
voltage categories: high, medium and low (HV, MV, LV). Consumers at each&#13;
voltage level are charged only upstream costs. Therefore, capacity costs at&#13;
each supply voltage must be identified.&#13;
For example, assume that data is available on the investment costs&#13;
associated with extra high voltage (EHV) and the HV transmission facilities.&#13;
Next, the average incremental costs 3/ (AIC) of EHV and HV transmission could&#13;
1/   From a practical point of view, it is clear that if peak consumers are&#13;
incorrectly charged the high capacity costs of expensive base load units&#13;
(e.g., nuclear), then it may encourage them to install their own captive&#13;
gas turbine plant. Even intuitively, such a pricing policy would not&#13;
appear to be very sensible.&#13;
2/   Particularly at the distribution level, the size of a given feeder may&#13;
depend on local peak demand which may not occur within the system peak&#13;
period. This complicates the problem of allocating distribution capacity&#13;
costs among the various rating periods (see for example, M. Boiteux and&#13;
P. Stasi, op. cit.)&#13;
3/   Suppose that in year i, AMWi and I  are the increase in demand served&#13;
(relative to the previous year), anA the investment cost respectively.&#13;
Then, the AIC of capacity is given by:&#13;
AIC  -L'Z le/(t-r)'          'AN/ci :  o   ee/ r)LI&#13;
where r is the discount rate (e.g, the opportunity cost of capital) and&#13;
T is the planning horizon (e.g., &gt; 10 years). We note that in the AIC&#13;
method the actual additional increments of demand are considered as they&#13;
occur, rather than the hypothetical fixed demand increment AD used (more&#13;
rigorously) in calculating generation LRMC. However, because there is no&#13;
problem of plant mix with T&amp;D investments, AIC andthe hypothetical incre-&#13;
ment method will yield similar results, while AIC is usually much easier&#13;
to calculate using rapidly available planning data. For a more detailed&#13;
description of AIC, see: R.J. Saunders, J.J. Warford and P.C. Mann,&#13;
"Alternative Concepts of Marginal Cost Pricing for Public Utility Pricing:&#13;
Problems and Applications in the Water Supply Sector", Staff Working&#13;

be computed, and annuitized (using the discount rate) over the lifetime of&#13;
the plant (e.g., 30 years) to provide an estimate of this element of marginal&#13;
costs ( &amp;LRMC HV). Then, the total LRMC of capacity during the peak period,&#13;
at the HV level would be:&#13;
LRMC        = LRMC          /(1-L  /100) + IALRMC&#13;
HV Cap.       Gen. Cap.      HV               HV&#13;
where LHV % is the percentage of incoming peak power that is lost in EHV and&#13;
and HV network.&#13;
This procedure may be repeated at the MV and LV levels. Thus the&#13;
LRMC of capacity to medium voltage consumers is given by:&#13;
LRMV Cap.   LRMCHV Cap /(1-L mv/100) + ALRMCMV&#13;
where ALRMCmv is the element of incremental MV capacity costs (e.g., AIC of&#13;
distribution substations and primary feeders), L mv% is the percentage of in-&#13;
coming peak power that is lost at the MV level.&#13;
The LRMC of T&amp;D calculated in this way is based on actual growth of&#13;
future demand, and averaged over many consumers. However, some exceptions&#13;
should be noted. First certain transmission li es may be specifically asso-&#13;
ciated with particular generating sites (e.g., remote hydro), and therefore&#13;
could be considered a generation cost rather than a transmission cost.&#13;
Second, some transmission may be associated with specific loads, and there-&#13;
fore the costs of such facilities should be allocated accordingly. For&#13;
example, suppose that a particular system has two geographically distinct&#13;
load areas: a central area consisting of a group of cities, and a remote&#13;
area which is predominantly rural. Then the concept of a generation power&#13;
pool can be used to calculate a common generating cost for serving both areas,&#13;
but different transmission costs may be determined for each area by allocating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
the costs of transmission links appropriately. Third, it may be possible&#13;
to identify facilities which are specific to certain consumers, and these&#13;
could be allocated to consumer costs; e.g., a special sub-transmission link&#13;
and substation for a large industry. This last point is also important in&#13;
dividing the distribution costs between LV and consumer costs; e.g., a given&#13;
customer may have a very long service drop line which should be specifically&#13;
allocated to this user, rather than being included in the LV AIC calculation.&#13;
C.3 Marginal Energy Costs&#13;
With reference to Figure C.1, it may be deduced that LRMC qf energy&#13;
during the peak period will be the running costs of the machines to be used&#13;
last in the merit order, to meet the incremental peak kWh represented by   D.&#13;
In our simple model, this would be the fuel and operating costs of gas tur-&#13;
bines. These costs have to be adjusted by the appropriate peak loss factors&#13;
at each voltage level, as in the case of marginal capacity costs.&#13;
Similarly, the LRMC of off-peak energy corresponding to a load&#13;
increment during the off-peak period would usually be the running costs of the&#13;
least efficient base load or cycling plant used during this period. 1/ We&#13;
note that the loss factors for adjusting off-peak costs will be smaller than&#13;
the peak period loss factors; resistive losses are a function of the square of&#13;
the current, and current flows are greatest during the peak period. 2/&#13;
1/   Exceptions to this generalization would occur when the marginal plant&#13;
used during a rating period was not necessarily the least efficient&#13;
machine that could have been used. For example, less efficient plants&#13;
which have long start-up times and are required in the next rating&#13;
period, may be operated ealier in the loading order than more efficient&#13;
plant. This would correspond to minimization of operating costs over&#13;
several rating periods rather than on an hourly basis.&#13;
2/   See for example:  C. J. Cicchetti, W. J. Gillen and P. Smolensky,&#13;
op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Some complications arise particularly in the case of all-hydro and&#13;
mixed hydro-thermal systems. First, a predominantly hydro system may be&#13;
energy constrained, i.e., it may be short of reservoir storage rather than&#13;
generating capacity. Thus all incremental capacity is needed primarily to&#13;
generate more energy because the energy shortage precedes the capacity con-&#13;
straint. In this case, the distinction between peak and off-peak costs,&#13;
and between capacity and energy costs, tends to blur. Because hydro energy&#13;
consumed during any period (except when spilling) usually leads to an equi-&#13;
valent drawdown of the reservoirs, it may be sufficient only to levy a simple&#13;
kWh chage at all times, e.g., by applying the AIC method of total incremental&#13;
system costs.&#13;
Second, where hydro is involved, marginal energy costs have to be&#13;
determined carefully. These costs would be close to zero, at times when water&#13;
is being spilled or mandatorily run-off for other purposes (e.g., irrigation).&#13;
HDwever, in a mixed hydro-thermal system, if the hydro is used to displace&#13;
more expensive thermal plant, then the running cost of the latter is the&#13;
relevant marginal energy costs.&#13;
Third, if the pattern of operation is likely to change rapidly in&#13;
the future (e.g., shift from gas turbines to peaking hydro as the marginal&#13;
peaking plant, or vice versa), then the value of the LRMC of energy would have&#13;
to be calculated as a weighted average, with the weights depending on the&#13;
share of future generation by the different types of plant used.&#13;
C.4 Consumer Costs&#13;
These costs are those which can be readily allocated to customers.&#13;
Fixed customer costs consist of non-recurrent expenses attributable to items&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34 -&#13;
such as service drop lines, meters and labor for installation. These costs&#13;
may be charged to the customer as a lump sum or distributed payments over&#13;
several years.&#13;
Recurrent customer costs occur due to meter reading, billing,&#13;
administrative and other expenses. These could be imposed as a flat charge,&#13;
on a repeated basis, in addition to the usual kW and kWh charges. In general,&#13;
the allocation of incremental (non-fuel) operation, maintenance and adminis-&#13;
trative costs among the three basic categories of costs: capacity, energy and&#13;
customer, varies from system to system and requires specific analysis. How-&#13;
ever, these costs are usually small and will not greatly affect the results.&#13;
Section D&#13;
Adjusted LRMC Tariff Structure&#13;
Once strict LRMC has been calculated, the first stage of tariff&#13;
setting is complete. In the second stage, the actual tariff structure which&#13;
meets economic second best, social, financial, political and other constraints&#13;
must be derived by modifying strict LRMC, and this topic is dealt with below.&#13;
This process of adjusting LRMC will, in general, result in deviations in both&#13;
the magnitude and structure of strict LRMC. Changes in tariff structure at&#13;
this stage will be based mainly on socio-political factors, e.g., differen-&#13;
tiation by type of consumer (residential, commercial, industrial and so on),&#13;
or by income level (poor, middle and high income residential). Practical con-&#13;
siderations such as the difficulties of metering and billing will also affect&#13;
the final tariff structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
The constraints which necessitate deviations in the final tariffs&#13;
relative to strict LRMC fall into two categories. 1/ The first group consists&#13;
of distortions which may be analyzed basically within an economic framework,&#13;
i.e., second best considerations and subsidized (or lifeline) tariffs for low&#13;
:ncome consumers. In these cases, it is possible to quantify the extent of&#13;
the deviation from strict LRMC by using an appropriate pricing model and&#13;
explicit system of shadow prices. The second group includes all other con-&#13;
siderations such as financial viability, socio-political constraints and&#13;
problems of metering and billing where strict economic analysis is difficult&#13;
to apply. These two groups of constraints may be interrelated, e.g., sub-&#13;
sidized tariffs can simultaneously have economic welfare, financial and&#13;
socio-political implications.&#13;
D.1 Second Best Considerations&#13;
Where prices elsewhere in the economy, especially in the case of&#13;
substitutes and complements for electric power, 2/ do not reflect marginal&#13;
costs, a "second best" departure from a strict marginal cost pricing policy&#13;
fcor electricity services may be required. For example, the subsidies&#13;
for imported generators and/or diesel fuel,which exist in many developing&#13;
1J   We note that strict (shadow priced) LRMC also deviates from the LRMC&#13;
calculated on the basis of financial costs, because shadow prices are&#13;
used instead of the market prices of electricity sector inputs. This&#13;
is done to correct the distortions in the economy. Therefore, thie&#13;
constraints which force further departures fron strict LRMC (in the&#13;
second stage of the tariff setting procedure) may also be considered&#13;
consequently as distortions which impose their own shadow values on the&#13;
calculation. See M. Munasinghe and J. J. Warford, op.cit., for details.&#13;
2!   More generally, price distortions affecting inputs into the production&#13;
of electric power and outputs of other sectors which are electricity&#13;
intensive (e.g., aluminium) should also be considered. The former&#13;
category may be dealt with by direct shadow pricing of inputs, while&#13;
the latter requires more detailed analysis (although such cases are rare).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
countries, may make it advantageous for users to set up their own captive&#13;
plant, even though to the economy as a whole this is not the least cost way&#13;
of meeting the demand. The appropriate solution in this case might be for&#13;
the government to revoke such subsidies or restrict imports of private&#13;
generating plant. However, if transportation policy dictates the need to&#13;
maintain subsidies for diesel fuel, or if strong pressure groups make such&#13;
changes politically unfeasible, the low cost of (subsidized) private genera-&#13;
tion may require the setting of an optimal grid supplies electricity price,&#13;
which is below strict LRMC. The extent of the deviation from strict LRMC is&#13;
determined by the magnitude of the subsidy and degree of substitutability of&#13;
the alternative energy source (see Appendix 2 for details).&#13;
A related question concerns the availability of subsidized kerosene&#13;
which in many developing countries is aimed mainly at providing basic energy&#13;
requirements for low income consumers at prices they can afford. 1/ In part,&#13;
the subsidy may also prevent low income households especially in rural area&#13;
from shifting to use of non-commercial fuels, e.g., wood, the over-use of&#13;
which leads to deforestation and associated environmental consequences, or&#13;
animal dung, which has a high opportunity cost as a fertilizer. If we assume&#13;
the kerosene subsidy as given, then once again the price of electricity must&#13;
be reduced proportionately.&#13;
1/   However, a number of unfortunate side effects may follow, including the&#13;
practice of mixing kerosene with gasoline, which is typically sold at a&#13;
higher price per gallon. The income distributi6n effects of such a&#13;
policy may also be perverse. For example, in some countries the rela-&#13;
tively wealthy have benefitted from the subsidy by converting prime&#13;
movers which use other fuels, such as motor car engines, to kerosene use.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
D.2 Subsidized or Lifeline Rates&#13;
In addition to the second best economic arguments (e.g., associated&#13;
with subsidized kerosene), socio-political or equity arguments are often&#13;
advanced in favor of "lifeline" rates for electric power, especially where&#13;
the costs of electricity consumption are high in comparison to the relevant&#13;
income levels. While the ability of electric power utilities to act as dis-&#13;
criminating monopolists gives them an advantage in addressing these issues,&#13;
it is clear that the appropriateness of the "lifeline" rate policy and the&#13;
size of the rate blocks requires detailed analysis. Such an analysis would&#13;
involve the study of a whole chain of interrelated energy and other effects,&#13;
which are generally of a higher order of complexity in developing countries&#13;
thasn in the developed-country context.&#13;

Figure D.1: ECONOMIC BASIS FOR THE SOCIAL OR LIFELINE RATE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38 -&#13;
The concept of a subsidized "social" block, or "lifeline" rate,&#13;
for low income consumers has another important economic rationale, based on&#13;
the income redistribution argument. We clarify this point with the aid of&#13;
Figure D.1 which shows the respective demand curves AB and GH of low (11) and&#13;
and average (I 2) income domestic users, the social tariff P  over the minimum&#13;
consumption block 0 to Q min  and the marginal cost based price level P . All&#13;
tariff levels are in domestic market prices.  If the actual tariff P - P e&#13;
then the average household will be consuming at the "optimal" level Q29 but&#13;
the poor household will not be able to afford the service.&#13;
If increased benefits accruing to the poor have a high social value,&#13;
then, although in nominal domestic prices the point A lies below P  , the con-&#13;
sumer surplus portion ABF multiplied by the appropriate social weight w could&#13;
be greater than the shadow price of supply. The adoption of the increasing&#13;
block tariff shown in Figure D.1, consisting of the lifeline rate P , followed&#13;
by the full tariff P  , helps to capture the consumer surplus of the poor user,&#13;
but does not affect the optimum consumption pattern of the average consumer. 1/&#13;
In practice, the magnitude Q i  has to be carefully determined, to avoid sub-&#13;
siding relatively well-off consumers; it should be based on acceptable cri-&#13;
teria for identifying "low income" groups, and reasonable estimates of their&#13;
minimum consumption levels (e.g., sufficient to supply basic requirements for&#13;
lighting and minor appliances). 2/  The level of P  relative to strict LRMC&#13;
1/   Ignoring the income effect due to reduced expenditure of the average&#13;
consumer for the first block of consumption, i.e., up to Q mi.&#13;
2/   In most developing countries Q i would be less than 100 kWh per month.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
may be determined on the basis of the poor consumer's income level relative&#13;
to some critical consumption level, as shown in Appendix 2.  The utility's&#13;
revenue constraints would also be considered in determining P  and Q in.&#13;
This approach may be reinforced by an appropriate connections policy (e.g.,&#13;
subsidized house connections, etc.).&#13;
D.3       Financial Viability&#13;
The financial constraints most often encountered relate to the&#13;
revenue requirements of the sector, and are often embodied in criteria&#13;
such as some target financial rate of return on assets, or an acceptable&#13;
rate of contribution towards the future investment program. In principle, for&#13;
state-owned power utilities, the most efficient solution would be to set&#13;
price equal to marginal cost and rely on government subsidies (or taxes) to&#13;
meet the utilities financial needs. In practice, some measure of financial&#13;
autonomy and self-sufficiency is an important goal for the sector. Because of&#13;
the premium that is placed on public funds, a marginal cost pricing policy&#13;
which results in failure to achieve minimum financial targets for continued&#13;
operation of the power sector, would rarely be acceptable. The converse and&#13;
more typical case, where marginal cost pricing would result in financial&#13;
surpluses well in excess of traditional revenue targets, most often leads to a&#13;
situation which is politically embarrassing. Therefore in either case,&#13;
changes in revenues have to be achieved by adjusting the strict marginal cost&#13;
tariffs.&#13;
It is intuitively clear that discriminating between the various con-&#13;
sumer categories so that the greatest divergence from the marginal cost price&#13;
occurs for the consumer group with the lowest price elasticity of demand, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
vice versa, will result in the smallest deviations from the "optimal" levels&#13;
of consumption consistent with the strict marginal cost pricing rule. 1/&#13;
Generally, in developing countries the necessary data for the analysis of&#13;
demand by consumer categories is rarely available, so rule-of-thumb methods&#13;
of determining the appropriate tariff structure have to be adopted. However,&#13;
the fiscal implications of an increasing cost industry (i.e., marginal costs&#13;
greater than average costs) should be exploited to the full. Thus electric&#13;
power tariffs (especially in a developing country) constitute an excellent&#13;
means of raising public revenues in a manner which is generally consistent&#13;
with the economic efficiency objective, at least for the bulk of the consumers&#13;
who are not subsidized, while at the same time helping to supply basic energy&#13;
needs to low income groups.&#13;
D.4 Other Considerations&#13;
There are several additional economic, political and social con-&#13;
siderations that may be adequate justification for departing from a strictly&#13;
marginal cost-based tariff policy. The decision to electrify a remote rural&#13;
area, which may also entail subsidized tariffs because the beneficiaries are&#13;
not able to pay the full price based on high unit costs, could be made on&#13;
completely non-economic grounds, e.g, for general socio-political reasons such&#13;
as maintaining a viable regional industrial or aricultural base, stemming&#13;
rural to urban migration, or alleviating local political discontent. How-&#13;
ever, the full economic benefits of such a course of action may be much&#13;
1/   See W. J. Baumol and D. F. Bradford, "Optimal Departures from Marginal&#13;
Cost Pricing," Am. Econ. Rev., June 1970, pp. 265-283; and M. S. Feldstein,&#13;
"Distributional Equity and the Optimal Structure of Public Prices,"&#13;
Am. Econ. Rev., 1973, pp. 32-36.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
greater than the apparent efficiency costs which arise from any divergence&#13;
between actual price and marginal cost. Again, this possibility is likely&#13;
to be much more significant in a developing country than in a developed one,&#13;
not only because of the high cost of power relative to incomes in the former,&#13;
but also because the available administrative or fiscal machinery to redis-&#13;
tribute incomes or achieve regional or industrial development objectives by&#13;
other means is frequently ineffective.&#13;
For the same reason, it is particularly difficult to reform pricing&#13;
policy where low incomes and a tradition of subsidized power combine to create&#13;
extreme difficulties in raising prices to anywhere near marginal costs. In&#13;
practice, price changes have to be gradual, in view of the costs which may be&#13;
imposed on those who have already incurred expenditures on electrical equipment&#13;
and made other decisions, while expecting little or no changes in traditional&#13;
power pricing policies. The efficiency costs of "gradualism" can be seen as&#13;
an implicit shadow value placed upon the social benefits that result from this&#13;
policy.&#13;
D.5 Metering and Billing&#13;
Owing to the practical difficulties of metering and billing, the&#13;
tariff structure may have to be simplified. For example,the number of&#13;
customer categories, rating periods, consumption blocks, voltage levels, and&#13;
so on, will have to be limited.&#13;
The degree of sophistication of metering (e.g., by time of day)&#13;
depends on the net benefit of metering, problems of installation and mainte-&#13;
nance, and so on. Thus, for very poor consumers receiving a subsidized rate,&#13;
a simple current limiting device may suffice, because the cost of even simple&#13;
kWh metering may exceed the net benefit equal to the lower supply cost of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
reduced consumption, less the decrease in consumption benefits. In general,&#13;
various forms of peak load pricing (i.e., maximum demand or time-of-day&#13;
metering) would be more applicable to large MV and HV industrial and commnr-&#13;
cial consumers. 1/&#13;
Most LV consumption, especially for households, is metered only on&#13;
a kWh basis, with the price per kWh based on a combined energy and "rolled in"&#13;
capacity charge (e.g., using appropriate coincidence and load factors). More&#13;
sophisticated meters, such as time-of-day meters which incorporate synchro-&#13;
nous clocks, may be affected by power outages. At the other end of the scale,&#13;
current limiting devices are easier to tamper with. Some developing countries&#13;
may lack technically skilled labor for installation and maintenance of sophis-&#13;
ticated meters, or even reliable meter readers. Therefore, choice of appro-&#13;
priate metering is usually very country specific, and is likely to involve&#13;
many practical considerations.&#13;

Appendix 1&#13;
Allocation of Capacity and Energy Costs Among Peak and Off-Peak Users&#13;
The simplified model of a typical electric power generation system&#13;
is used below to show from a conceptual viewpoint, how a long run marginal&#13;
cost (LRMC) analysis based on the optimal system expansion plan yields the&#13;
following idealized conclusions. 1/&#13;
1.   Peak users should pay off-peak LRMC of capacity as well&#13;
as energy costs.&#13;
2.   Off-peak users should pay only off-peak LRMC of energy.&#13;
3.   LRMC of peak capacity   LRMC of base load capacity&#13;

complicating factors such as a larger number of rating periods and&#13;
plant types, non-coincidence of the rating periods with the economic&#13;
crossover points between different plant types, economies of scale&#13;
and variable heat rates for a given plant type, hydroelectric plant&#13;
including pumped storage, reserve margins and stochasticity of supply&#13;
and demand, and so on. The most important difference with respect to&#13;
the general case is that some capacity costs would have to be borne by&#13;
consumers outside the peak period. However, the bulk of the capacity&#13;
costs would still be allocated to peak period users. A simplified&#13;
exposition of this result is provided in: J. T. Wenders, "Peak Load&#13;
Pricing in the Electric Utility Industry," The Bell Journal of Economics,&#13;

Piture 1.1. Plant Costs and-Annual Loadi Duration Curve (LDC)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Consider an all thermal generation system having the annual load&#13;
duration curve (LDC) shown in Figure 1.1. There are only two types of plant&#13;
whose linearized cost characteristics are given in the table below, and also&#13;
in the figure. We ignore for the moment, all losses, reserve margin, etc.&#13;
Capacity cost per&#13;
kW installed             Operating Costs&#13;
Plant Type             (annuitized)                 per hour&#13;
1. Peaking (e.g. Gas&#13;
Turbines:  GT)           a                           e&#13;
2. Base Load&#13;
(e.g. steam)             b                           f&#13;
Total cost of 1 kW which is used h hours per year:&#13;
GT : a + e.h&#13;
Base:  b + f.h&#13;
Let H be the hours of operation which corresponds to the crossover&#13;
point for which GT and Base Load plant total costs are equal.&#13;
Therefore, a + e.H - b + f.H&#13;
b-a&#13;
H =(e-f ) .......................................&#13;
The most economic use of plant can be determined by examining the&#13;
LDC, OABCEF:&#13;
(1) For planned base load operation (i.e. more than H hours per&#13;
year), use base load plant; X kW&#13;
(2)  For planned peak operation (i.e. less than H hours per year),&#13;
use GT; (Y-X) kW&#13;
Total annual costs of meeting the demand depicted by the LDC is:-&#13;
C  = X (b+f.T) + (Y-X)    (a+e.H)&#13;
0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
Case 1:   Only peak period demand increases by 1 kW (as shown by shaded&#13;
area AGNB in Figure 1.1):&#13;
The optimal system planning response is to increase GT by 1 kW.&#13;
Total annual cost is C1 - X (b+f.T) + (Y+1-X) (a+e.H)&#13;
Therefore, increase in cost:  C 1-C  = a + e.H&#13;
This is the increase in system costs incurred because of the&#13;
1 kW increase in marginal (or incremental) demand during the&#13;
peak period, and thus the peak period user must pay this cost.&#13;
The peak costs consist of:&#13;
(1) Capacity charge - a per kW per year&#13;
(2) Energy charge - e per kWh.&#13;
It may be seen that peak users payment - a+e.H - increase in&#13;
system costs.&#13;
Case 2:   Only off-peak period demand increases by 1 kW (as shown by shaded&#13;
area CIJE in Figure 1.1).&#13;
The optimal system planning response is to add 1 kW more of base&#13;
load plant. But now there is 1 kW less of GT required than before.&#13;
Total annual cost: C2 - (X+1).(b4f.T) + [Y-(X+1)] (a+e.H)&#13;
Therefore, increase in cost:  C   -c  (b4f.T) - (a+e.H)&#13;
2o0&#13;
- (b-a) + (f-e).H + f (T-H).&#13;
Sustituting for H from equation on (1.1)&#13;
C2-Co   (b-a) + (f-e).(b-a)/(e-f) + f.(T-H)&#13;
C2-C * f(T-H)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
Therefore, the increase in system cost incurred due to the 1 kW&#13;
increase in marginal off-peak demand is equal to the energy cost of operating&#13;
the base load plant during this period, and thus off-peak users must pay only&#13;
this energy charge f per kWh. There are no capacity costs incurred by off&#13;
pealk users, since off peak users payment - f(T-H) - increase in system cost.&#13;
In particular, we note that the base load capacity cost (b) is&#13;
exactly offset by the total cost saving due to GT which is not required any&#13;
more (i.e., capacity cost 'a' plus net fuel cost saving (e-f).H inside the&#13;
shakded area LKIC). In other words: Peak capacity cost - Base load capacity&#13;
costs - net fuel savings: a - b - (e-f).H&#13;
Case 3:   Both peak and off-peak demand increases by 1 kW.  This case is&#13;
a linear combination of Cases 1 and 2, and therefore consumer&#13;
charges are:&#13;
(1)  Peak capacity charge:    a per kW per year;&#13;
(2)  Peak energy charge:       e per kWh;&#13;
(3)  Off-peak energy charge:  f per kWh.&#13;
Clearly, total peak and off-peak users payment - b+f.T - increase in system&#13;
cost. These results may be generalized to include more types of generating&#13;
units, and rating time periods; e.g., n plant types and n rating periods,&#13;
where these rating periods are chosen to coincide with the economic crossover&#13;
poLnts between competing types of plant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
In this case LRMC prices would be:&#13;
O to H    =  peak period   :   capacity charge a1 per kW per year, and&#13;
1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#13;
energy charge e1 per kWh&#13;
H  to H   '  2   period    :   only energy charge e2 per kWh&#13;
1     2                                              2&#13;
H    to T    nt  period    : only energy charge e~ per kWh&#13;

Appendix 2&#13;
Model for Optimal Electricity Pricing in a Distorted Economy&#13;
In this appendix, a general expression for the socially optimal&#13;
electricity price is developed based on the border prices, to compensate for&#13;
distortions in the economy. From the general equation, results for optimal&#13;
electricity pricing are derived, for cases which reflect:&#13;
(a) a perfectly competitive economy (classified results);&#13;
(b) economic second best considerations; and&#13;
(c) subsidized social prices or lifeline rates for poor&#13;
consumers.&#13;

Figure 2.1 SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR A GOOD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
The supply and demand for electricity is shown in Figure 2.1, where&#13;
S is the supply curve represented by the marginal cost of supply (evaluated&#13;
at domestic market prices of inputs), and D is the corresponding demand curve&#13;
for a specific consumer. Starting with the initial combination of price and&#13;
consumption (p, Q), consider the impact of a small price reduction ( dp),&#13;
and the resultant increase in demand ( dQ), on the net social benefits of&#13;
electricity consumption.&#13;
Before evaluating the net social benefit of this price change, let&#13;
us define several parameters. First, suppose we calculate the marginal cost&#13;
of electricity supply MC without shadow pricing the inputs, i.e., in market&#13;
prices.  Then a  is defned as the electricity conversion factor (ECF) which&#13;
transforms the (market priced) marginal cost of electricity supply MC into the&#13;
corresponding real economic resource cost, i.e., when all the inputs to the&#13;
electricity sector are correctly shadow priced, the (border priced) marginal&#13;
supply cost is MCB  = (a .MC).  Second, we assign a specific social weight W&#13;
to each marginal unit of consumption (valued in market prices) of a given&#13;
individual i in the economy, e.g., if this electricity user is poor, the&#13;
corresponding social weight may be much larger than for a rich customer, to&#13;
reflect society's emphasis on the increased consumption of low income groups.&#13;
Third, if the given individual's consumption of goods and services other than&#13;
electricity (valued in market prices), increases by one unit, then the border&#13;
priced marginal social cost of economic resources used (or the shadow cost to&#13;
the economy) is b-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
As a result of the price reduction, the consumer is using dQ units&#13;
more of electricity, which has a market value of (p. dQ) (i.e., area IFGH). 1/&#13;
However, the consumer's income has increased by the amount PQ - (P- P)&#13;
(Q + dQ), and assuming none of it is saved, this individual's consumption of&#13;
other goods and services will increase by the amount (Q. dp-p. dQ), also&#13;
valued in market prices (i.e., area BEFG minus area IFGH). Therefore, the&#13;
consumer's total consumption, i.e., electricity plus other goods, will in-&#13;
crease by the net amount (Q. dp) in market prices. This is the traditional&#13;
increase in consumer surplus benefits. The shadow value of this increased&#13;
consumption is W  . (Q. dp) where W   is the social weight appropriate to this&#13;
consumer's income/consumption level.&#13;
Next consider the resource costs of these changes in consumption.&#13;
The shadow cost of increasing electricity supply is (a .PMC. dQ), (i.e., a&#13;
times area IJKH), and the resources used up to provide the other additional&#13;
goods consumed b .(Q. dp - p. dQ), where a  is the conversion factor for&#13;
electricity production, and b  is the conversion factor for other goods con-&#13;
sumed by this consumer. Finally, the income change of the electricity pro-&#13;
ducer must also be considered, but this effect may be ignored if we assume&#13;
quite plausibly that the producer is the government.&#13;
The total increase in net social benefits due to the electricity&#13;
price decrease is given by:&#13;
NB = W (p. dQ) - ap.(MC. dQ) + (W c- bc).(Q. dp - p.dQ)&#13;
11   The little triangle LFG may be neglected throughout this analysis because&#13;
its area is ( dp. dQ)/2, where both  dp and  dQ are small increments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Therefore:&#13;
( dNB/ dp) = Q [(W  - b ) + n.b ] - n.a. .(MC/p)&#13;
where n = (p. dQIQ. dp) is the elasticity of demand (magnitude).&#13;
The necessary first order condition for maximizing net social benefits, in&#13;
the limit, is d(NB)/dp-O. This yields the optimal price level:&#13;
p* = a . MC/[b c+ (W c   bc)/n]      (2.1)&#13;
This expression may be reduced to a more familiar form, by making&#13;
some simplifying assumptions.&#13;
Case 1:   Perfectly competitive economy where market prices and shadow prices&#13;
are the same, and income transfer effects are ignored, i.e., no&#13;
social weighting.&#13;
Therefore, a  - W  = b  = 1, and equation (2.1) reduces to:&#13;
p * = MC                  (2.2)&#13;
c&#13;
This is the classical result (discussed in subsection B.1), where net social&#13;
benefits are maximized when price is set equal to marginal cost at the market&#13;
clearing point (p ,QC ) in Figure 2.1.&#13;
Case 2:  Income transfer effects ignored, because the marginal social benefit&#13;
of consumption is equal to the marginal social cost to the economy&#13;
of providing thip consumption.&#13;
Therefore, W = b , and equation (2.1) becomes:&#13;
c    c&#13;
Pe* = (ap.MC) / bc = MCBe/b          (2.3)&#13;
This is the optimal marginal cost based electricity price, when efficiency&#13;
(shadow) prices are used which emphasize the efficient allocation of resources&#13;
and neglect income distributional considerations.&#13;
As mentioned earlier, the marginal social cost of electricity&#13;
supply (MCBe) may be evaluated in a straightforward manner by applying the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
appropriate shadow prices to the least cost mix of technically determined&#13;
inputs used in producing electricity.  However, the conversion factor b-&#13;
depends crucially on the type of consumer involved.&#13;
For residential electricity consumers, b  represents the consump-&#13;
tLon conversion factor (CCF), which reflects the resource cost or shadow&#13;
value of one (market priced) unit of the household's marginal consumption&#13;
basket.  If the CCF&lt;1, then p *&gt;(MCB ).&#13;
Another interesting case illustrates the application of equation&#13;
(2.3) to correct for economic second-best consideration arising from energy&#13;
substitution possibilities. As an extreme case, suppose all expenditures&#13;
diverted from grid supplied electricity will be used to purchase alternative&#13;
energy which is subsidized by the government (e.g., kerosene for lighting,&#13;
or diesel for autogeneration).  In this case, b  is the ratio of the border&#13;
priced marginal cost of alternative energy to its market price; and may be&#13;
written:&#13;
MICB&#13;
b   =     ae&#13;
ae&#13;
Thus from equation (2.3): 1/&#13;
Pe*   MCB e. (P  /MCB  )             (2.4)&#13;
e    e   ~ae    ae&#13;
1/   The logic of this expression may be clarified by considering the case&#13;
when the actual p &gt;p *. Then the shadow cost of one unit of expenditure&#13;
on electricity iSeMCg /Pe, while if this sum was used to purchase alter-&#13;
native energy the shadow cost would be MCB  /p  .  Since p &gt;p *, MCB /p &gt;&#13;
MCB  /p  , and the country is better off i       remor  electricity ts used&#13;
insead of the alternative energy.  Therefore,  e should be reduced to&#13;
pe*.  Similar reasoning can be used to show that if p &lt;p *, then p  should&#13;
be increased to the value Pe*                            e  e          e&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Since the alternative energy is priced below its border marginal cost, i.e.,&#13;
b &gt; 1, then p e* &lt; MCB also. Therefore, the subsidization of substitute&#13;
energy prices will result in an optimal electricity price which is below its&#13;
shadow supply cost.&#13;
If it is not possible to determine the consumption patterns of&#13;
specific consumer groups, then b  could be defined very broadly as the average&#13;
conversion factor for all electricity users, e.g., the SCF, as discussed in&#13;
subsection B.4.&#13;
Case 3:   General&#13;
Equation (2.1) is the optimal electricity price when social (shadow) prices&#13;
are used, which incorporate income distributional concerns.&#13;
Consider the case of a group of very poor consumers for whom we may&#13;
assume:  W  &gt;&gt; b (n-1).  Therefore, equation (2.1) may be written:&#13;
P * m n.MCB /W&#13;
An even greater simplification is possible if it is assumed that n = 1; thus&#13;
P * = MCB /W&#13;
'8 e c&#13;
For illustration, suppose that the income/consumption level of these poor&#13;
consumers (c) is 1/3 the critical income/consumption level (c) which is like&#13;
a poverty line. Then a simple expression for the social weight is:&#13;
W  c 3&#13;
c   c&#13;
Therefore p5* = MCB /3, which is the "lifeline" rate or subsidized tariff&#13;
approprt  t e&#13;
appropriate to this group of low income consumers.&#13;

            Electric power pricing policy
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper presents a framework for
            electric power pricing which is especially appropriate to
            the developing countries.  It contains a review of the basic
            theory of marginal cost pricing applicable to the power
            sector, and a summary of the current state-of-the-art.  The
            adaptation of the theory for practical application in
            relation to the objectives of power pricing policy in the
            LDC context, results in a two stage procedure for tariff
            setting.  First, a set of prices based on the strict
            long-run marginal costs (LRMC) of supply which meet the
            economic efficiency criterion are computed.  Second, the
            strict LRMC is adjusted to arrive at an appropriate
            realistic tariff structure which satisfies various
            constraints.  Explicit models are presented which permit
            modifications to be made to the strict LRMC on the basis of:
            (a) economic-second best considerations (especially with
            regard to the pricing of substitute fuels), and (b) social
            considerations relating to subsidized prices for poor
            consumers.  The tailoring of tariff policy to meet sector
            financial needs and other requirements such as simplicity of
            metering and billing are also discussed.
