FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report.    The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family planning   programs.    They  include  several country and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis and research, and on reports of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.      The&#13;
papers   are   the  work   of   individuals  and   the  views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and development issues among students and practitioners of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
International migration is a conspicous form of population&#13;
interaction between richer and poorer countries. This paper makes an&#13;
assessment of the dimensions of past and present day migration, its&#13;
determinants, the effects on sending countries, costs and benefits and the&#13;
nature of constraints on free movement of people.&#13;
The paper puts together available data show that the present scale of&#13;
permanent emigration, in contrast to nineteenth and early twenieth century&#13;
migration from Europe, can only absorb a small proportion of population growth&#13;
in developing countries. Temporary migration, undoubtedly important for a few&#13;
countries, constitutes a small proportion of the labor force in all developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
Immigration policies of immigrant countries are shown to be generally&#13;
restrictive, although responsive to economic conditions such as the degree of&#13;
substitution between foreign and domestic labor, shifts in the demand for&#13;
labor caused by particular policies and structural changes. Over time&#13;
however, immigration policies tend to become restrictive partly because of the&#13;
social and political problems of integrating large foreign populations.&#13;
Drawing upon various studies, the supply response is analyzed in&#13;
terms of responses of different labor-supplying countries to income&#13;
differentials, domestic economic conditions, and cultural factors. Government&#13;
initiatives in labor supplying countries to increase market shares are&#13;
examined. Available data on (temporary) migrant characteristics is put&#13;
together to analyze which individuals try to or actually emigrate. Although&#13;
data do not permit clear conclusions, they suggest that the financial costs of&#13;
migration can be high (making it necessary for potential migrants to borrow)&#13;
thus making it difficult for the very poor or unemployed to migratte. Studies&#13;
also indicate that temporary workers are generally young adult males, married,&#13;
and better educated than the general population. The proportion of women is&#13;
low but increases over time.&#13;
Data on migrant's savings and remittances and the effects of&#13;
remittances on family expenditures is examined to show that migrants and their&#13;
households are high savers and there is a pronounced preference for spending&#13;
on housing, land, and new construction. Indirect evidence also suggests that&#13;
investment out of wage income can make a significant contribution to crop and&#13;
cattle production.&#13;
The empirical literature on macroeconomic effects in labor sending&#13;
countries is extremely fragmented but does show that there can be sharp&#13;
increases in wages, often of unskilled workers. Skilled worker vacancies&#13;
caused partly by emigration are however more difficult to fill. In rural&#13;
areas, while there is evidence of shifts in cropping patterns to higher value&#13;
crops as well as investment in crop and cattle production, there is also&#13;
evidence of land left uncultivated despite increased acquisition of land.&#13;
Remittances are shown to be an important source of foreign exchange for&#13;
several countries; in a few instances government has provided special import&#13;
facilities for migrants--these imports although not a Large proportion of&#13;
remittances have included cars and vehicles and other consumer goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The paper attempts a discussion of the major issues in cost-benefit&#13;
analysis and summarizes a few studies which show that the benefits are likely&#13;
to be greater when emigratiorn involves relatively unskilled workers.&#13;
Available information on skill composition of temporary worker migrants is&#13;
analyzed to show that for many sending countries, the proportion of unskilled&#13;
and semiskilled workers is substantial. However with a few exceptions, the&#13;
share of unskilled is not overwhelming, particularly in nonfamily orientecl&#13;
permanent migration. In this context the dimensions of the so-called&#13;
brain-drain and the idea of taxing such immigrants to compensate sending&#13;
countries are discussed.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
Continued rapid population growth in most developing countries will&#13;
tend to exacerbate economic disparities between developed and developing&#13;
countries. Between now and the year 2000 for example, the increase in the&#13;
number of young adults (aged twenty to forty) in developed countries will be&#13;
19 million, less than one-third of what it was during the preceding twenty&#13;
years. In developing countries the increase will be 600 million, almost one&#13;
and a half times what it was in the preceding twenty years (Demeny 1983). To&#13;
take one graphic example of what these trends will mean, the size of the&#13;
working-age population in China and India--which was about 50 percent larger&#13;
than that in industrialized countries in 1960--will be more than 150 percent&#13;
larger by 2000.&#13;
The economic implications of these demographic changes are&#13;
pervasive. First, even with high rates of domestic savings in most developing&#13;
countries, there are serious constraints on increasing the amount of capital&#13;
per worker. If all investment in countries like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nepal,&#13;
and Rwanda had been allocated to potential new workers during 1980, for&#13;
example, each person would have had less than $1,700 invested on his or her&#13;
behalf. In the United States investment per worker would have been close to&#13;
$200,000 (World Development Report, Table 5.4, p. 87). Second, rapid&#13;
population growth imposes also constraints on improving the skill and&#13;
education of the labor force in developing countries. Despite the progress&#13;
that has already been made, the adult literacy rate in most low-income African&#13;
countries was below 40 percent in 1980, and less than 30 percent of schonl-.e&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

children were enrolled in secondary school. Even in India, acLult literacy is&#13;
below 40 percent, compared to 71 percent in Korea in 1960, on the eve of&#13;
Korea's spurt of export-led economic: growth. Finally, even if per capita&#13;
incomes grow faster in developing than in industrialized countries, the&#13;
absolute income gap will not decrease significantly because the initial&#13;
difference in per capita income is, for many devealoping countries, so large.&#13;
For example, the absolute gap between Indonesia and the United States&#13;
increased from about $8,000 in 1960 to over $12,000 in 1981, atlthough per&#13;
capita income in Indonesia grew at a rate almost double that in the United&#13;
States.&#13;
The links that bind developing and industrialized economies could&#13;
help to narrow these disparities and. increase income and employment in&#13;
developing countries in three main ways: through migration, trade, and&#13;
capital flows. This paper makes an assessment oE one of these links--&#13;
international migration.   It provides an analysis of dimensions of past and&#13;
present day migration, the eEfects on and costs and benefits to sending and&#13;
receiving countries, and the nature of constraints on free movement of&#13;
people.&#13;
II. Historical and present dimensions&#13;
International migration is the most conspicuous form of population&#13;
accommodation between richer and poorer countries. Not all migration has be,en&#13;
purely economic in motivation; (for example, refugees) nor has it alL been&#13;
voluntary. But international migration motivated by economic disparities has&#13;
been a feature of the international economy for centuries. Present-day&#13;
migration takes several forms. Some migrants move with their families, to&#13;

stay more or less permanently in their new country. Others, that is,&#13;
temporary workers are allowed to stay only for a limited time, and usually&#13;
leave their dependents behind. However many of them stay for extended length&#13;
of time by renewing their work contracts and some attain immigrant or citizen&#13;
status eventually. For many countries, illegal migration has been important;&#13;
such migrants incLude those who came into a country illegally and those who&#13;
came in legally but stay beyond the permitted length of stay.&#13;
Permanent migration and population growth. The nineteenth and early&#13;
twentieth centuries witnessed permanent intercontinental migration on an&#13;
unprecedent scale. About 50 million people left Europe for Australia, Canada,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Latin America, the United States, and New Zealand. Gross immigration&#13;
accounted for more than 30 percent of the population increase in the United&#13;
States between 1850 and 1940, about 60 percent in Canada, 51 percent in&#13;
Australia ancd New Zealand, and about 15 percent in Latin America (Table 1).&#13;
This same period also witnessed emigration from the northern hemisphere to the&#13;
south as colonization spread, and labor movements from Asia increased,&#13;
fostered by the system of indentured labor. About 8 million Chinese and over&#13;
3 million Indians, for example, are estimated to have gone to other parts of&#13;
Asia and overseas between mid-nineteenth century and World War I (Zolberg&#13;
1983, p. 22).  These labor movements also contributed to south-south&#13;
migration:  for example, immigrants accounted for over 50 percent of the&#13;
increase in Sri Lanka's population between 1880-1910 (Colin Clark, 1954, p.&#13;
118).&#13;
Today, the United States remains the largest host country for&#13;
permanent immigrants. Between 1960 and 1980, it received 7.8 million&#13;
irmmigrants (INS, Statistical Yearbook 1980, Table 1) while Australia, Canada,&#13;
and New Zealand together admitted 5.7 million (U.N. Monitoring Report, 1983,&#13;
Table 1). Other countries admit immigrants--Israel, United Kingdom, France&#13;
--but the numbers are relatively small.   The contribution of gross immigration&#13;
to population growth during this period was 16 percent in the United States,&#13;
and much more in Canada and Oceania. Argentina and Venezuela are the two&#13;
major countries of immigration in Latin America today.    Net immigration into&#13;
Venezuela has amounted to 32,000 a year during the first half of the 1970s,&#13;
and 72,000 in Argentina (about 3.0 percent of mid-period population in each&#13;
case) (Kritz et al. 1981, p. 225 and 246). However a large part of legal&#13;
migration is temporary and seasonal, and both countries have also experienced&#13;
illegal migration (see below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The nationality of permanent immigrants varies among the major host&#13;
countries, but the share of non-European (mainly developing) countries is&#13;
large--80 percent in the United States, 57 percent in Canada, and 42 percent&#13;
in Australia during 1976-80 (U.N. Monitoring Report 1983). Latin Americans&#13;
and Asians have figured prominently in immigration into the United States and&#13;
Canada, partly as a result of refugee influxes and partly because of changed&#13;
U.S. policies since 1965, allowing a more even spread of immigrants from a&#13;
wider range of countries. Even before this change, however, the share of&#13;
northern Europeans in total immigration into the United States had declined.&#13;
From nearly 80 percent in 1871-80, it fell to 34 percent in 1921-30 (INS&#13;
Statistical Yearbook 1980). This trend illustrates an important feature of&#13;
migration: the incentive to emigrate declines as domestic conditions improve.&#13;
Emigration from Europe between 1851 and 1940 amounted to over 15&#13;
percent of the increase in population, peaking at nearly 20 percent during&#13;
1881-1910 (Table 2). For particular countries the rate was higher: nearly 45&#13;
percent of the increase in population the British Isles during 1846-1932&#13;
emigrated, over 50 percent of the mid-period population. Between 30 percent&#13;
and 40 percent of the increase in populations in Italy, Portugal, and Spain&#13;
emigrated (Woytinsky 1954, Table 33). In comparison, present day emigration&#13;
rates are small: between 1970 and 1980, emigration to the major immigrant&#13;
countries absorbed about 3.0 percent of population growth in Europe and Latin&#13;
America and less than 1 percent in Asia and Africa.&#13;
For a few countries permanent emigration rates continue to be high,&#13;
and these tend to be countries already of relatively high income. For Greece&#13;
and Portugal emigration was over 15 percent of the population increase during&#13;
1971-80, and for Italy, and Yugoslavia, and Hong Kong over 5 percent. Several&#13;
small Caribbean countries close to the United States also had relatively high&#13;
rates; Jamaica's emigration was equivalent to about 40 percent of its&#13;
&#13;

population increase from 1971-80; for the Dominican Republic and Haiti, the&#13;
comparable number was 8 percent. in contract, the figure for Korea, Mexico,&#13;
and the Philippines is around 3.5 percent, and for India, only 0.2 percent&#13;
(U.N. Monitoring Report, 1983, TabLe 6).&#13;
These figures point up to one clear conclusion: permanent emigration&#13;
has only a limited role to play in reducing the work force and thus&#13;
unemployment in the developing countries as a group. To take a simple&#13;
example, even if 700,000 immigrants a year are admitted by the major host&#13;
countries (roughly the number admitted annually during 1976-80) up to the year&#13;
2000, and all of them come from low-income countries, less than 2 percent of&#13;
the projected growth in population in the low-income countries between 1982&#13;
and 2000 would have emigrated.    By contrast, such immigration would account&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
for 22 percent of the projected natural increase in population of the&#13;
industrialized market economies and 36 percent of the projected increase in&#13;
the main host countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United&#13;
States.&#13;
For particular countries, of course, emigration may continue to be&#13;
important. But if the "quota" system of immigration continues, the amount of&#13;
emigration will be fixed. Its relative contribution to employment will depend&#13;
on the size of increase in the populations of the emigrant country.&#13;
Emigration therefore can be expected to have little impact on populous&#13;
countries even if the rate of growth declines.&#13;
Temporary worker migration and labor force. Recent years have seen a&#13;
marked increase in "temporary" migration. One of the earliest examples was in&#13;
South Africa, where the Chamber of Mines began to recruit migrant labor from&#13;
Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Swaziland as early as 1896. In Europe,&#13;
beginning in the 1960s, large numbers of foreign workers were recruited by&#13;
France, Germany, Switzerland, and others from poorer neighbors like Greece,&#13;
Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. By 1974, temporary foreign&#13;
workers constituted 30 percent of the work force in Luxembourg, over 18&#13;
percent in Switzerland and about 8 percent in Belgium, France, and Germany&#13;
(Swamy 1981).&#13;
Large-scale recruitment in the oil-rich countries of the Middle East&#13;
has led to even higher proportions of foreign workers. In Kuwait, Libya,&#13;
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates, foreign workers from the&#13;
neighboring Arab states of Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, and also&#13;
from Bangladesh, India, the Republic of Korea, Pakistan, and Turkey,&#13;
constitute between 34 percent (Saudi Arabia) and about 85 percent (United Arab&#13;
Emirates) of the work force in 1975 (Serageldin 1983, Table 4.1). Other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
countries have also admitted temporary workers on a systematic basis.    During&#13;
1978, for example, the United States admitted 62 thousand temporary workers&#13;
(see Table 2). These included a large proportion of professionally and&#13;
technically cqualified people, but aLso 11,000 agricultural laborers from the&#13;
West Indies. Ghana and The Ivory Coast had about 1.0 million foreign workers&#13;
in 1975, mostly from Mali, Togo, and Upper Volta (Zachariah and Conde, 1981,&#13;
Table 34). One estimate puts the number of migrant workers in Argentina&#13;
(mainly from Bolivia and Paraguay) and Venezuela (mainly from Colombia) at&#13;
about 2 million (ILO 1984, Table 4.2).&#13;
The number of temporary migrant workers in Europe peaked at 6.5&#13;
million in 1974 and declined to 6.2 million in 1980. In the Middle East&#13;
foreign workers have increased from an estimated 1.8 million in 1975 to over 3&#13;
million in 1980. The total number of temporary workers--in Europe, the Middle&#13;
East, South Africa, and West Africa--is probably about 13 milLion to 15&#13;
million.&#13;
But as is the case with permanent emigration, contemporary emigration&#13;
of temporary workers constitutes only a small proportion of the labor force in&#13;
all developing countries although, undoubtedly emigration is very important&#13;
(see Table 3)1 for a few.&#13;
Illegal migration. By definition, it is hard to counit the number of&#13;
immigrants who have entered a country illegally. However, the best estimates&#13;
indicate that. illegal migration is often heavy. For example, between 2&#13;
million and 4 million immigrants were living illegally in the United States in&#13;
1980, half ol them from Mexico (Warren and Passel). They may have constituted&#13;
about 4 to 8 percent of the Mexican labor force. When the authorities in&#13;
Venezuela tried to register all immigrants in 1980, they were able to identify&#13;
about 270,000 illegal aliens over 90 percent of them from Colombia. Other&#13;

III. Determinants of migration&#13;
The basic incentive to migrate is the earnings gap between the&#13;
immigrant ancd emigrant countries. The probability of finding employment&#13;
modifies this incentive as in internal migration, but for two important&#13;
reasons, these factors play a less important role in international&#13;
migration. First, host countries today exercise considerable (though not&#13;
complete) control over the number of foreigners they admit, and in the case of&#13;
temporary workers, the length of stay. This means that there are potential&#13;
migrants in poorer countries; who want to migrate but are unable to. (In the!&#13;
United States, country quotas for family and nonfamily migrants from&#13;
developing countries are generally oversubscribed. Paine notes that the queue&#13;
of applicants in Turkey for work in Germany had grown to over a million in the&#13;
early 1970s, Paine, p. 67.) Second, migrants, particularly temporary workers&#13;
are often "recruited" to fill existing or expected vacancies. For them&#13;
therefore, there is certaint:y of employment, at least for a period of time.&#13;
However, the system of recruited migration has been implemented with more or&#13;
less rigor; for example, spontaneous migration was a significant part of total&#13;
migration in Europe particuLarly in France, prior to 1973. Spontaneous&#13;
migrants often arrived on visas that did not provide for employment, but&#13;
registered as workers once they found jobs. Recent migration to the Middle&#13;
East has been relatively free for some Arab countries like the Yemen Arab&#13;
Republic. For such migrants and for illegal migrants, the probability ofE&#13;
finding a job is an important determinant of the decision to migrate.&#13;
Because the major constraint on international migration is the&#13;
immigration policies of host countries, some of the determinaLnts of such&#13;
policies are discussed in some detail in the next section. Such constraints&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
are also often country-specific. For example, the United States sets uniform&#13;
country limits on permanent immigration. But there are a number of situations&#13;
in which such formal country limits are absent. The nationality composition&#13;
of migrants may then be determined by factors such as relative income&#13;
differentials, distance, cultural proximity, availability of information and&#13;
by more informal preferences of host countries for certain nationalities.&#13;
These factors are considered in the second section. The third section&#13;
describes the nature of sending country governments' involvement in exporting&#13;
labor.&#13;
Some economic and social determinants of immigration policies&#13;
Immigration policies of host countries have varied over time in&#13;
response to changing economic conditions, the relative bargaining strength of&#13;
those who gain (employers and sometimes consumers) and those who lose (native&#13;
workers) from immigration, and the social pressures that are generated by&#13;
influx of foreigners. In general, there is more resistance when the&#13;
substitutability of foreign for domestic workers is high; a given increase in&#13;
immigration can then cause a large decline in natives' wages or if their wages&#13;
are inflexible, to an increase in their unemployment. On the other hand,&#13;
bouyant economic growth characterized by large shifts in demand for labor are&#13;
conducive to larger immigration because the added supply of labor may not&#13;
prevent wages from rising at a rate that the native population has been&#13;
accustomed to. In all situations however, there are constraints on social&#13;
integration and assimilation, they tend to be more severe in homogenous&#13;
societies, particularly as immigrants increase as a proportion of the&#13;
population and receive increasing attention and public resources.&#13;
Considered below are the results of three studies that throw some&#13;
light on the economic determinants of immigration policies. The first is of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
the timing of the first U.S. quotas; the second is of physician immigration to&#13;
the United States and the third is of the working of the guestworker program&#13;
in Germany prior to 1973.&#13;
Historically, the United States has beeri a country of spontaneous&#13;
immigration.   Pronativist senatiments were however expressed from time to time&#13;
and were particularly strong in the two or three decades prior to the WorLd&#13;
War I. An immigration commission wa.s created in 1907, and quotas were imiposed&#13;
following the war. A study (Williamson 1982), that uses a general-equilibrium&#13;
framework suggests that the rise in pronativist sentiment may have been duae in&#13;
part to a sharp decline in America's ability to absorb immigrants. The&#13;
economy-wide unskilled labor demand elasticity is estimated to have decliined&#13;
over the whole period 1850-1929, but the decline was particulatrly sharp&#13;
between 1900 and 1929, declining from -3.25 to -L.60. This implied that while&#13;
in 1900, a 1 percent per annum increase in unskiLled labor (as through&#13;
immigration) would have caused real unskilled wages to decline by .31 percent,&#13;
in 1929, it would have lead to a decline of 0.63 percent. Further, while&#13;
there was a steady rise in dynamic absorptive capacity (i.e., shifts in the&#13;
derived demand for unskilled labor) across the nineteenth and twentieth&#13;
centuries, during 1899-1909, the rise was only half that in 1839-59, and about&#13;
one-third that in the preceding thirty years. The contribution (to shift of&#13;
demand) of fatrmland growth had declined sharply and more importantly, biased&#13;
technological change (favoring capital and skill) had intensified the effect&#13;
of a somewhat slower growth in capital stock.    According to the author, this&#13;
offers support for the view that America's declining immigrant: absorptive&#13;
capacity following the 1890s had a significant impact on the timing of the&#13;
first quotas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Host countries have also attempted to control the number and&#13;
occupations of professional and technically qualified immigrants. For&#13;
example, the United States imposes an overall limit of 20 percent (of overall&#13;
ceiling of 290,000 for all preference categories) on the number of occupation-&#13;
related immigrants, and the labor certification required of such immigrants&#13;
allows for occupational regulation.&#13;
The process of labor certification in the United States usually&#13;
requires that a job offer be made, but in addition, for most occupations, the&#13;
employer has to demonstrate his inability to recruit workers already legally&#13;
resident in the United States. While there are no previously established&#13;
quotas for particular occupations or skill categories, (family related&#13;
migrants who enter the labor market and exchange visitors and students who&#13;
change immigration status wouLd probably make such quotas difficult to&#13;
enforce), the system has nevertheless been made to respond to perceived&#13;
shortages and surpluses by relaxing or tightening the constraints on&#13;
immigration of particular kinds of professionals. For example, in 1969, the&#13;
share of physicians (and related workers) in professional immigration was 12&#13;
percent, it rose to nearly 25 percent in 1973 but dropped to 11 percent in&#13;
1979 (United States Naturalization and Immigration Service data on&#13;
professional, technical, and kindred workers).&#13;
According to Coldfarb (1982), the 1965 laws which abolished the old&#13;
national origins system and substituted a system that included occupational&#13;
preferences allowed a much larger number of Asians (a major source of medical&#13;
graduates) to enter. In addition, in 1965, the United States Department of&#13;
Labor declared a physician shortage in hospitals which meant that foreign&#13;
physicians could readily obtain labor certification for permanent&#13;
immigration. In 1970, an amendment allowed certain categories of exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
visitors (including physicians) to convert to immigrant status without leaving&#13;
the country for two years as was previously required. When the perceived&#13;
shortage began to turn into i perceived surplus, laws were again amended&#13;
(1976) and medical examination requirements were made stiffer.&#13;
The questions of course are (i) who perceives shortages and&#13;
surpluses, (ii) what are the determinants and, (iii) how effectively and&#13;
quickly can these perceptions be translated into legal and administrative&#13;
action. Unfortunately, there are no clear answers. A shortage is often seen&#13;
as a shortfalL from a normative pupil-teacher ratio or patient-physician ratio&#13;
by consumers and administrators. This has little economic meaning since aLn&#13;
increase in the supply of these services even above the norm would decrease&#13;
prices, and increase output and perhaps, the quality of the services&#13;
provided. The history of occupational migration into the United States&#13;
suggests a more important proximate determinant:   sudden and large-scale&#13;
increase in desmand for certain services: for example, the upwared shift in&#13;
demand for medical services resulted from an increase in the so-called&#13;
third-party payments including Medicare and Medicaid (public reimbursement for&#13;
medical expenditures of the elderly and the poor) and the postwar babyboom&#13;
generated increase in demand for teachers.   These perceived shortages&#13;
generally provoke considerable expansion in training facilities: the annual&#13;
output of medical graduates in the United States increased from 7400 in 19I65&#13;
to over 10,004) in 1973, and the number of first year medical students from&#13;
8,772 in 1963-64 to over 16,000 in 1977-78 (Goldfarb, 1982, pp. 436-7).    Over&#13;
a period, therefore alleged shortages disappear.&#13;
Many countries have used short-term migrant workers on a systematic&#13;
basis to either supplement permanent migration (as in the United States) or to&#13;
largely substitute for it as in Western Europe and the Middle East, for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
example. The increase in demand for foreign labor in the Middle East can be&#13;
directly linked to oil-related income growth in the host countries of the&#13;
Middle East and to the fact that imported labor--largely in the construction&#13;
and service sectors--did not compete with domestic labor. In other&#13;
situations, the reasons for importing labor may have been more complex. An&#13;
interesting hypothesis in the context of worker migration to Europe is that&#13;
host country governments encouraged the use of lower cost migrant labor in&#13;
industries that were losing comparative advantage.&#13;
A recent study of the guestworker system in Germany (Bhagwati, et al.&#13;
1983) analyses cross-sectional industrywise utilization of foreign workers&#13;
between 1964-65 and 1971-72 when the government had few overall restrictions&#13;
on the numbers of foreign workers recruited. Provided there were no&#13;
objections from unions and local authorities, employers could recruit as many&#13;
foreign workers as required. In addition, although in theory, foreign workers&#13;
were required to get a labor permit and visa before arrival, many entered on&#13;
tourist passports and subsequently obtained a work permit after they had found&#13;
a job.   (Between 15 and 45 percent of Turkish worker departures to West&#13;
Germany in these years were thus "spontaneous migrants', see Paine, Table&#13;
A-4, p. 180). Using variables such as change in the degree of protection, the&#13;
rate of growth of value of output, and the capital intensity of output the&#13;
study attempts to explain the rate of growth of foreign workers in twenty-six&#13;
industries. The estimated equation is&#13;
AF = 112.889 + 0.7044   AP + 2.4347   ATe - 0.8307k&#13;
(8.89)    (6.12)        (1.81)         (-4.30)&#13;
R2  .65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
The rate of growth of foreign labor utilization -F     is shown to be related&#13;
F&#13;
positively to changes in value of production Ap, and (less strongly) to&#13;
change in the effective protection coefficient ATe, and negatively to the&#13;
capital (physical plus human) labor ratio.&#13;
The positive correlation between   AF/F and ATe  is viewed as evidence&#13;
against the hypothesis that the German government: may have been more willing&#13;
to let industries suffering Erom reduced tariff protection to import more&#13;
labor. In fact, foreign workers in the textile industry doubled between&#13;
1964-65 and 1971-72, although total employment declined, and the proportion of&#13;
foreign workers in the industry went up by 13 percentage points at the sarne&#13;
time that effective protection declined. The inverse relationship to capital&#13;
intensity presupposes that the more capital intensive an industry, the more it&#13;
will respond by economizing on labor use rather than by importing labor,&#13;
ceterus paribus.&#13;
However the study did not find any evidence that differential changes&#13;
in the availability of domestic workers (domestic employment) or their cost&#13;
(real wage), or the differential between German wages and wages in the soturce&#13;
countries had any impact on the importation of foreign labor. This last&#13;
suggests, according to the authors, that the system was demand determined, but&#13;
neither the cost nor availability of domestic labor appears to have influenced&#13;
such demand! These studies suggest that immigration policies are more leniernt&#13;
when the demand for labor is growing rapidly, when foreign labor does not&#13;
compete with domestic labor and when there are sudden increases in demand for&#13;
particular kinds of workers, particularly professionals whose supply cannot be&#13;
increased quickly.&#13;
But the experience of the United States since the first quotas were&#13;
established as well as that of Western Europe since the mid-1970s suggest that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
other influences are also at work, specificaly, tighter imigration policies&#13;
up over time irrespective of economic conditions.&#13;
The immigration laws of the 1920s in the United States attempted for&#13;
the first time to control the number of immigrants, particularly from&#13;
countries in southern and eastern Europe. The quotas established for each of&#13;
these countries equalled a proportion of foreign born persons of those&#13;
nationalities resident in the United States in 1920 and totalled approximately&#13;
150,000 a year. Immigrants from western and northern Europe were not subject&#13;
to quota limits. In total, immigration amounted to about 400,000 per year in&#13;
the 1920s, compared to about 900,000 and 600,000 in the first and second&#13;
decades of the century. During the thirties, because of the depression&#13;
immigration totalled only half a million. In addition, official records show&#13;
that about 123,000 Mexican immigrants were either deported or required to&#13;
leave; one scholar estimates that over 400,000 were actually repatriated&#13;
(Morgan and Gardner, p. 362).&#13;
But the postwar years, particularly the middle of the twentieth&#13;
century saw the re-emergence of very bouyant immigrant absorptive&#13;
conditions. According to Williamson (1982, Table 4), the annual increase in&#13;
the derived demand for (unskilled) labor during 1948-66 was nearly five times&#13;
as high as during 1899-1909. 1/ However there was no significant relaxation&#13;
1/ A recent study (Grossman 1983) based on cross section data for the United&#13;
States for 1970 estimated that a 1 percent increase in the number of foreign&#13;
workers could lead to about 0.1 percent decline in real wages of native and&#13;
second generation native workers, and a .23 percent decline in the wages of&#13;
first generation immigrants themselves, if all wages are flexible. These&#13;
results suggest that the effects of immigration on real wages were generally&#13;
smaller than in 1929 when, according to Williamson, a 1 percent per annum&#13;
increase in unskilled labor would have lead to a 0.63 percent decline in real&#13;
wages of all workers. However the two studies are not strictly comparable&#13;
particularly because the Williamson study does not specifically address th&gt;&#13;
question of substitability between native and foreign workers, while the&#13;
Grossman study estimates elasticities of substitution and [inds that&#13;
immigrants substitute for seczna generatLon worKers much mcre easIly tF-,&#13;

of the ceiling on immigrants.   Although the McCurran-Walter Act. of 1952 did&#13;
modify some aspects of immigration policy towards nonrefugee inmigrants, it&#13;
was little more than a restatement of the restrictive legislation of the&#13;
1920s. It reconfirmed the national origins basis, and did not greatly&#13;
increase the possible size of economic immigrants; total immigration&#13;
(including wives and children of American citizens) was about 250,000 per year&#13;
during the 1950s, i.e., somewhat less than in the 1920s.&#13;
The major reform of 1965 abolished the national origins basis for&#13;
quotas and substituted a more equitable system based on uniform quotas for all&#13;
countries. Hlowever it continued to impose an overall limit of 170,000 for&#13;
countries outside the western hemisphere (includLng Asian and Pacific&#13;
countries). By 1978, a numerical limitation of L20,000 had been imposed on&#13;
western hemisphere countries as well. Exemptions in the laws for certain&#13;
classifications of relatives and refugees have made immigration larger than&#13;
the worldwide ceiling of 290,000 particularly in the late 1970Cs. But it is&#13;
worth noting that the scale of current immigration is not very different from&#13;
those envisioned in the 1920s although the 1950s and 1960s were clearly more&#13;
bouyant than the twenties. ODne author suggests that the policy of the late&#13;
1920s was more generous in relation to population size. In the late 1920s,&#13;
there were about 400 persons in the United States for each newly arrived&#13;
immigrant. In 1970, there were 544 (Reimers, p. 14). Thus while economic&#13;
conditions matter, it appears that resistance to immigration increases over&#13;
time, and once numerical restrictiorns are put in place, they are not altered&#13;
easily.&#13;
Most host countries in west Europe began to impose restriction on&#13;
recruitment of workers in the early 1970s. Thus Switzerland attempted to&#13;
"stabilize" its migrant labor force in spring 1971, and then introduced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
measures to reduce it in July 1973; in 1972 and 1973, France, Holland and West&#13;
Germany introduced restrictions on new entrants, culminating at the end of&#13;
1973 in a ban by the latter two countries on the entry of non-EEC workers.&#13;
(Paine, p. 1). Although these restrictions are attributed to the oil crisis,&#13;
the timing of the beginning of these restrictions suggests that the social and&#13;
political problems of managing a system of temporary recruitment were&#13;
beginning to be felt much earlier. There had been, as Bohning describes it, a&#13;
"maturing" of the migrant population. Migration had taken on a circulatory&#13;
character as the same workers returned and the length of stay increased, many&#13;
migrants acquired (or became eligible to acquire) permanency status; and the&#13;
age-sex composition of the migrant population began to parallel normal&#13;
profiles (Swamy 1981). The oil crisis appears to have precipitated a sharp&#13;
turn in policy which would have occurred anyway. In fact, most west European&#13;
countries recovered rapidly in 1976-79; but restrictions on foreign workers&#13;
did not ease.&#13;
Problems with social integration become particularly evident at the&#13;
community level. There are whole neighborhoods in the United States and&#13;
Europe where adults are predominantly first generation immigrants. Of&#13;
France's 4 million foreigners (in 1980), 40 percent live around Paris and in&#13;
some sections of the city, more than half the primary schooL children have&#13;
foreign parents (Weiner, 1983). Many societies, particularly those with a&#13;
long history of immigration, cope with and even enjoy the cultural diversity&#13;
provided by foreigners, but even in such societies, immigration creates&#13;
stress. For example, voters in Dade Country, Florida (United States), in&#13;
November 1980 overturned a policy of bilingualism adopted in 1973 (Davis et&#13;
al, 1983, p. 21). Even in the most liberal of environments therefore,&#13;
integration is slow and delicate. As immigrants increase as a proportion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
the population, they receive increasing attention and public resources.    In&#13;
the long-run these factors may be more important in limiting immigration than&#13;
purely economic ones.&#13;
The supply response: nationality composition&#13;
Although the scale of migration is largely determined by host country&#13;
policies, the question nevertheless arises as to what factors determine&#13;
potential and actual supply from different countries. There is a general&#13;
tendency for host countries to employ workers from lower wage countries in the&#13;
immediate neighborhood. (This is le-ss true of permanent immigrants). This is&#13;
because shorter distances ease the flow of information and minimize the&#13;
financial costs of migration to both; individual migrants and to recruiting&#13;
agents and employers. Noneconomic factors also play a role and generally (but&#13;
not always, see below) reinforce the effects of distance. Recent policy&#13;
changes in the United States have put permanent immigrants from different&#13;
countries on equal footing, but in past, countries of the Eastern heimsphere&#13;
and Asia were discriminated against, mainly for cultural reasons. Some labor&#13;
importing countries in the Middle East (Saudia Arabia, Jordan) have&#13;
traditionally permitted greater ease of movement to Arabs from neighboring&#13;
countries (Yemen Arab Republic, Egypt) than to Asians. In West Europe,&#13;
workers from EEC countries have had (and continue to have) freedom of movement&#13;
denied to workers from other countries although this is not a purely cultural&#13;
phenomenon.&#13;
Because host countries often have preferences for certain&#13;
nationalities which then get reflected in their laws and recruitment&#13;
procedures, and further since migration data refers only to the numbers&#13;
actually admitted in accordance with those laws and preferences, it is&#13;
difficult to estimate the supply response of different countries to income&#13;
differentials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
A study by Lucas (1976) has attempted to estimate such parameters for&#13;
economically motivated immigrants into the United States. He regressed the&#13;
number of male applicants for labor certification from each country (divided&#13;
by the size of the male labor force in the native country) on measures of wage&#13;
and wage dispersion in the United States, per capita income in the sending&#13;
country (as a proxy for home-country wages), distance, whether the sending&#13;
country is English speaking and the proportion of applications refused (to&#13;
measure the discouraged applicant effect). Mean wage indicators are&#13;
statistically significant in both the linear and logit versions of the model,&#13;
although the effect of home-couintry income is quite weak in the latter.&#13;
Interestingly enough, the variable "English speaking" is significant but&#13;
distance is not (one way of explaining the last maybe that applicants for&#13;
permanent settlement are less inhibited by distance than temporary workers;&#13;
Lucas's sample consists of both and he does not distinguish between them).&#13;
In another study, the same author has modelled the demand and supply&#13;
of labor to South African mines (Lucas, 1983A). He shows that the mining&#13;
houses centralized recruiting in order to exploit monopsony power and that&#13;
southern Africa has not been a vast labor reserve for the mining houses in the&#13;
sense of infinite elasticity of labor supply. Upto 1974, mining houses had no&#13;
preference for any particular source of nonwhite labor, but simply hired all&#13;
nonwhite labor upto the point where marginal cost equalled marginal product.&#13;
(There is a distinction however between whites and nonwhites in the production&#13;
function; for various reasons, the latter is assumed to be less productive).&#13;
He estimated a supply elasticity of 0.14, for nonwhite workers, based on data&#13;
for 1948-74.&#13;
In a later study (1983b) Lucas shows that as with overall supply, in&#13;
each of the major suppliers, workers responded positively to the expected wage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
differential between mine arLd home when not constrained by emigration&#13;
quotas. He also shows that factors other than wages influence supply. In&#13;
each country, more successful harvests or more ample rainfall significantly&#13;
reduced the Lncidence of mirLe work. Even from Botswana, Lesotho and the South&#13;
African homeLands, in each of which crop growing conditions are extremely&#13;
difficult, better crops detracted from migration to the mines, and as&#13;
population growth swelled the labor force, mine employment was promoted&#13;
significantly. In Mozambique, the ending of widespread force'd labor reducedi&#13;
the mine labor available. (The Portugese authorities required all working aLge&#13;
populations lo prove that they had worked for 6 months ina year; the&#13;
requirement could be voluntarily satisfied either through domestic wage work&#13;
or by contracting with an authorized recruiter for work abroad.)&#13;
Aftesr 1974, however, the mining houses exercised a demonstrated&#13;
preference for domestic (i.e., South African) nonwhite workers, and the market&#13;
for foreign workers has not operated on its supply curve. The creation of the&#13;
so-called homelands in 1978 has also lead a large pool of unemployed in 'South&#13;
Africa. Since 1979, the recruiting agency has maintained a target of 60&#13;
percent locaL and 40 percent. foreign labor; this ratio may further decline.&#13;
The study by Bhagwati (et al) referred to earlier estimated the&#13;
following equation analyzing the source composition of foreign workers in&#13;
Germany from five principal supplying countries--Turkey, Italy, Greece, Spain,&#13;
and Portugal--during 1964-71.&#13;
9- =Of.84510p - 1.31616%&#13;
(5.60)      (-3.77)&#13;
SER = .25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
where 8'd = deviation from the mean (0.2) of the share of incremental inflow of&#13;
workers from each of the five source countries during 1964-65 and 1971-72,&#13;
fl = deviation from the mean of the growth rate of population in the sending&#13;
country (as a proxy for the growth of labor force) and 8 = w the deviation&#13;
from the mean of the wage-rate in each country in 1971. The negative&#13;
relationship between 8w and Er on the one hand and the positive relationship&#13;
w   d&#13;
between Or and d on the other is interpreted to mean that "where the relative&#13;
p      d&#13;
wage is lower, and the incremental size of the workforce is larger, the&#13;
potential pool of applicants available to recruiters will be higher." The&#13;
initial share of the different nationalities however had no significant affect&#13;
(results not reported). The authors suggest that this may be because&#13;
different sized firms growing at different rates may lead to converging shares&#13;
at the industry level even if they individually hire more workers of the same&#13;
nationality as they did earlier.&#13;
While the above results infact parallel results that may be obtained&#13;
from a free migration model, it must be remembered that a substantial&#13;
proportion of workers were actually recruited by German authorities even in&#13;
this period. (On the other hand, from 1968 onwards, Italian workers could&#13;
come in freely under EEC rulers.) Therefore the results should be interpreted&#13;
to mean that the same factors that induce spontaneous migration also influence&#13;
recruiters' preferences. This is not an unreasonable interpretation and is&#13;
infact reflected in the changing nationality composition of migrant workers in&#13;
Germany. Between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s, the proportion of workers from&#13;
Turkey and Yugoslavia (relatively "new" exporters) in Germany's foreign labor&#13;
force increased by 10 percentage points, while the proportion of Greeks&#13;
declined by 7 percentage points. The proportion of Italians declined slightly&#13;
between 1972 and 1982; significantly, it did not increase despite their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
special status and despite the fact that foreign worker recruitment from non-&#13;
EEC countries virtually ceased after 1973.   Infact, Italy is e-stimated to have&#13;
had about half a million on illegal workers in 1979 (U.N. Monitoring Report&#13;
1983).&#13;
In the Middle East as well there was a remarkable change in the&#13;
nationality composition of migrant workers. The latter half of the 1970s saw&#13;
an increase in the porportion of non-Arab workers (particularly in the Gulf&#13;
States): from 12 percent in 1970 to 18 percent in 1975 (Choucri 1983, pp.&#13;
3-4) and may now be much higher. Non-Arab migrants came from countries&#13;
further away: Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Philipines, and Korea, counter to&#13;
the general tendency (at least in the case of temporary workers) for host&#13;
countries to attract workers from immediately neighboring and culturally more&#13;
similar countries. In many Gulf states more Asians were hirecl despite public&#13;
statements of preferences for Arabs. For example, during 1979-81, Kuwait&#13;
issued more new work permits to Asians than Arabs and in Oman and Abu Dhabi,&#13;
Arabs and Asians are roughly similar in size in the civil service (Choucri,&#13;
1983, pp. 10-11). Unfortunately there is no rigorous study relating change in&#13;
nationality composition to wage differentials, or other factors. But at least&#13;
one writer attributes the increase in the number of Asians to Arab labor&#13;
exporters' "inability" to meet the sharp increase in demand for labor&#13;
following the oil price increase of 1973, and to Asian's willingness to accept&#13;
job and living conditions and wages that Arabs resist (Chouri 1983, p. 4).&#13;
Myron Weiner (1982, p. 15) notes that in Abu Dhabi, wages paid to Asian&#13;
construction workers were sometimes below market wages and that "members of&#13;
the Indian middle class privately complained that they are paid less than the&#13;
Europeans or the many Arabs from Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan." In Dubai,&#13;
another of thbe Emirates, Weiner reports that "the Dubai Petroleum Company ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
is steadily replacing Americans and British on the staff with lower paid&#13;
Indians and other Asians at the rate of 20-25 per year". It appears therefore&#13;
the shift towards Asians has some economic basis. In addition, many Gulf&#13;
countries have feared that Arab migrants bring unwelcome "political ideologies&#13;
and cleavages that characterize other countries in the region," (Weiner, p.&#13;
28). In contrast, Asians are seen as outsiders and as nonpolitical. They are&#13;
expected not to interact with the local population, are less likely to stay&#13;
permanently and can be expelled with fewer political repercussions than would&#13;
result from expulsion of Arbas. Thus, political and cultural considerations&#13;
worked to increase the desirability of hiring Asians, contrary to the more&#13;
general pattern.&#13;
The supply response: government initiatives&#13;
Many writers also feel that the penetration of the Middle East market&#13;
by Asians, particularly by East Asians (Koreans, Phillipines, Thais) was&#13;
partly the result of these countries' initiatives and organizational skills&#13;
which few Arab countries displayed. This brings up the important question of&#13;
whether a labor exporter can increase its share of the migrant labor force by&#13;
increasing the flow of information, actively participating in the recruitment&#13;
process and by responding in a flexible way to host countries' demands.&#13;
Unfortunately, although many labor exporters have attempted to do so, there&#13;
has been no systematic study of their success or failure. A generally&#13;
acknowledged success story however has been that of South Koreans in the&#13;
Middle East. Unlike south Asians and Arabs the Korean worker is usually&#13;
recruited and employed by a Korean firm which has a construction (or other&#13;
service) contract in the host country. By the end of 1980, 97.7 percent of&#13;
Koreans workers in the Middle East were employed by Korean companies. These&#13;
workers are typically housed and fed in camps separated from the local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
community and thus are more acceptable to the host countries. The Korean&#13;
Ministry of labor has set various employment conditions to protect workers:&#13;
minimum wages, contract per'Lod (one year but extendable by mutual agreement),&#13;
working hours, leave, and casualty compensation., Presumably, these&#13;
regulations can be enforced since employers and workers are K'orean&#13;
nationals.   Income earned in the Middle East is taxed at lower rates than&#13;
comparable wage income earned in Korea and remittances deposited in banks earn&#13;
a special interest rate. On the other hand, to minimize worker expenditures&#13;
(in foreign exchange) on foreign goods or financial assets, about 75 percent&#13;
of the monthly wage is paid in Korean currency directly to the family in&#13;
Korea, and returning workers are allowed only a few tax-free imports. Thus&#13;
the Korean government appears to have successfully put togethler a "package"&#13;
approach to labor exports; between 1974 and 1981, the number of Korean workers&#13;
in the Middle East increased from about 400 to over 150,000, and the value of&#13;
construction contracts increased from less than $100 million to $13.4 billion&#13;
in 1982 (Sooyong Kim 1983 and Kyong-Dong Kim 1983).&#13;
The Korean "package" approach appears to be somewhat unique. More&#13;
typically, government intervention has involved specific measures to regualate&#13;
recruitment and placement. A study of nine Asian countries (Zar, 1984),&#13;
documents that seven of them operated state recruitment agencies and all of&#13;
them except Korea regulated the operation of private recruiters. Official&#13;
agencies however, appear to have had mixed success in the Middle-Eastern&#13;
context, although data is sketchy.   In Bangladesh during 1976-79, 34 percent&#13;
of migrants to the Middle-East were recruited through the off'icial agency, 8&#13;
percent through recruiting agents (known as passage brokers) and 58 percent&#13;
through relatives and friends already in the MiddLe-East (Ali et al, p.&#13;
1.1-14). A survey of Pakistani migrants (Cilani, Chapter 3, p.. 37) showed that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
75 percent of migrants found their jobs abroad through their own efforts or&#13;
with the assistance of friends and relative abroad: the remaining 25 percent&#13;
said they had obtained their jobs through recruiting agents. In the&#13;
Philippines, starting in 1974, the Government attempted to phase out private&#13;
recuriters and make the state agency the sole recruiting agent. However for&#13;
various reasons, the government reversed it poilcy in 1978, encouraging&#13;
greater participation by private agents. In the next four years, the number&#13;
of licensed agencies grew to over 1,000 and in 1983 included about 580 private&#13;
agents and about 230 "construction contractors" who are actually Philippine&#13;
construction companies that monopolize the supply of construction workers to&#13;
firms abroad. Workers recruited by these companies received considerably&#13;
lower wages than those supplied by the official agency who were paid directly&#13;
by the foreign employers. These companies appear to have "profited" by these&#13;
transactions but the government has not displaced them (Stahl, pp. 7-11).&#13;
Private recruiting agents number about 400 in Pakistan and about 300 each in&#13;
India and Bangladesh (Choucri 1983, p. 15).&#13;
Thus in many of these countries, private agents play a significant&#13;
role (although as shown earlier friends and relatives are the most valuable&#13;
recourse) and governments have attempted to regulate their modus operandi&#13;
since there are many instances of dishonesty and exploitation. Regulation has&#13;
involved penalties and even imprisonment for unfair recruitment procedures, a&#13;
requirement to hire workers from registered job seekers and the development&#13;
and enforcement of standard written forms of contracts for employment&#13;
abroad. At the same time, in at least some countries (Philippines, Thailand),&#13;
there are proposals for strengthening the private recruiting agency system by&#13;
weeding out those with poor records, but encouraging those remaining in&#13;
various ways. Governments have also intervented through public educational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
and orientational programs to increase the potential migrant's awareness of&#13;
work and Living conditions and his rights abroad.&#13;
Thus government interventions have varied--from the package approach&#13;
of the Koreans to regulation of agents and protection of workers' rights. Not&#13;
all of them have the potential to increase the sending country's market share;&#13;
infact attempts to regulate private agents and protect workers' rights could&#13;
have the opposite effect. Zar reports that private recruiting agents&#13;
complained that government regulations and administrative procedures delay&#13;
recruitment and increase their costs which reduces their ability to "bid" with&#13;
suppliers from other countries in the region. Recent developments show that&#13;
Korean Construction companies are themselves empLoying non-Koreans in the&#13;
Middle East. The ratio of non-Koreans increased from 12.2 percent in 1980 to&#13;
32.4 percent in 1982.   Wages of non-Korean (mainLy South Asian) workers were&#13;
34 to 60 percent of Korean workers. The Korean Ministry of labor has&#13;
therefore considered the elimination of standard labor contract requirements&#13;
in return for Korean companies limiting the employment of non--Korean (Kim).&#13;
More generally, as Suzanne Paine puts it, "as long as host cotntries can get&#13;
labor as cheaply elsewhere, any attempt by one of the labor exporting&#13;
countries to improve the situation of their nationals abroad can be countered&#13;
by utilizing more labor from a less demanding neighbor" (p. 153).&#13;
The supply response: characteristics of migrants&#13;
In the previous section, we have tried to answer the question of what&#13;
factors determine potential and actual supply from different countries. The&#13;
same question can be asked at a micro-level--given the uncertainity, which&#13;
individuals try to or actually migrate from a country. Altholugh there is&#13;
little by way of econometric analysis of this question (in the context of&#13;
international migration), data collected in surveys on migrant characteristics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
can provide some description of various economic and personal characteristics&#13;
of migrants in different part of the world. A few studies also compare these&#13;
characteristics to those of the general population. Summarized below are the&#13;
results of some of these surveys, mostly of "temporary" migrants.&#13;
The financial costs of migration may be a major deterrent to&#13;
emigration, even when employers pay for the cost of passage. Paine notes that&#13;
the nonofficial migrant from Turkey had to pay not only the cost of his&#13;
passage, but about one third of his annual income before departure in various&#13;
kinds of fees if he expected to stay abroad for a year. Official recruits&#13;
spent about half that; but all migrants were expected to carry with them $200&#13;
to $400 in foreign exchange (p. 66). On average, a migrant worker from&#13;
Pakistan spent Rs. 7,000 before depature in the late 1970s, a little more than&#13;
10 percent of expected income in the Middle East, but a large proportion&#13;
(perhaps 50 percent) of income before departure. Forty percent of these&#13;
workers had raised the money through loans, (perhaps friends and relatives)&#13;
(Gilani 1981, Part II, p. 37).&#13;
Fifty-two percent of Indian migrants from two villages in Kerala&#13;
spent between Rs 5,000- to 15,000 to go abroad--a major component of this&#13;
expenditure was the securing of a "No objection certificate" from the host&#13;
country.   A large proportion of the migrants from the richer village (82&#13;
percent) were able to finance this expenditure from own savings, but only 32&#13;
percent of migrants in the poorer village were able to do so, and borrowed&#13;
instead (Mathew and Nair, p. 1167-48). A survey in Philippines showed that&#13;
about 25 percent of households had borrowed money in order to finance&#13;
migration while 44 percent had financed it from personal savings (Smart and&#13;
Teodosio, p. 60).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Recruiting agents and even public officials demand paynents under the&#13;
counter, adding to the costs.   For example, the average monthly wage of a&#13;
Philippino seaman in the early 1980s was approximately $300 a nmonth; but the&#13;
standard under the counter fee charged by shipping agencies for placing&#13;
seamen--approximately $400. The cosits of securing a job in the Middle East&#13;
ranged from $200 to $914, compared to the $110 to $1200 annual income of&#13;
production, construction and service sector workers before departure (Stahl,&#13;
p. 15-16). In the state of Kerala, "'a thriving contraband business" existed&#13;
for the "No objection certificates". While close relative sent those&#13;
certificates f-ree of charge, the cost of obtaining them throgh private&#13;
agencies was often high because the agents "auctioned" the certificates.      The&#13;
weakest purchasers--usually one with per personal contacts in the Middle&#13;
East--often paid the highest price (Mathew and Nair, pp. 1148).&#13;
Migration may thus be difficult for the very poor or unemployed and&#13;
this suggests that migrants mkay not come from the lowest income groups or from&#13;
the ranks of the unemployed or underemployed unless they are able to borrow.&#13;
Unfortunately empirical evidence is scanty and in any case, underemployment is&#13;
difficult to identify.   For Turkey, Paine notes that migrants did come&#13;
generally from the better-off sections of the population.     The percentage of&#13;
openly unemployed at the time of departure or application declined during the,&#13;
1960s from about 14 percent (before departure) in 1963 to 4 percent (at the&#13;
time of application) in 1971. The latter number was considerably lower thtan&#13;
the unemployment rate for the' economy, but she points out that this may have&#13;
been partly due to the lengthening waiting list of people who wished to&#13;
depart. In the early years, a worker who became unemployed could apply and&#13;
leave for work abroad quickly, but as the waiting list grew, this course of&#13;
action became impossible, so that it was in the interest of workers to apply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
in advance of any potential unemployment (Paine, pp. 82-84). In Pakistan, a&#13;
survey indicated that only 7 percent of migrants had been unemployed before&#13;
departure, and another 10 percent had been students (Gilani 1981, Part II, p.&#13;
37). A Philippine survey showed that only 9 percent had had no work&#13;
experience before departure (Smart and Teodosio, p. 20). In Bangladesh, a&#13;
survey of 313 migrants showed that about 12 percent had been unemployed, while&#13;
another 17 percent had been students (Ali, pp. 89-90, Table 3.4). A survey of&#13;
two villages in Kerala in the late 1970s does not give information on&#13;
work-status before departure, but does record that fathers of one-third of the&#13;
migrants had worked as casual laborers and thus may have been underemployed&#13;
(Mathew and Nair, p. 1146).&#13;
The regional and rural urban distribution of migrants may also give&#13;
some indication of the economic status of migrants. In Turkey, the richer&#13;
more westernized and more conveniently located regions supplied the largest&#13;
share of officially recruited migrants and migrants informed a large&#13;
proportion of the population of these regions (Paine, pp. 72-74). On the&#13;
other hand, in Pakistan the Barani (rainfed agricultural) areas, at least&#13;
initially had a higher representation perhaps because they have a long&#13;
tradition of migrating for work, given poorer economic conditions (Gilani&#13;
1983, p. 11). In India, the state of Kerala supplied more than half of all&#13;
Indian migrants to the Middle East in the late 1970s, although the proportion&#13;
appears to have declined in recent years (Gulhati, p. 2219). However this&#13;
phenomenon may have less to do with the relative poverty of the region (there&#13;
are other states in India with lower levels of income) than with the fact that&#13;
Kerala has a large proportion of Muslims (as well as high levels of&#13;
literacy). Gulhati notes that that areas in the state with a substantial&#13;
proportion of Muslims lead in their contribution to the outflow of workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Similarly, evidence! on rural-urban distribution is equivocal. In&#13;
Turkey, Paine notes that the proportion of rural migrants increased over time&#13;
(partly as a result of improved recruitment procedures) suggesting that there&#13;
may have been an increase in the proportion of migrants who had been&#13;
underemployed before departure.   In Bangladesh, most migrants (78 percent) in&#13;
a 10 percent sample of recoreds kept by BMET in the late 1970s were from rural&#13;
areas (Ali, et al. p. 39). On the other hand, in Philippines about 30 percent&#13;
each had resided in the national capital region and in the (rural) provicnes&#13;
since birth, while about 40 percent had migrated to the capital city region,&#13;
although not necessarily recently (Smart and Teodosio, p. 17). Thus there is&#13;
no clear indication that migrants come predominantly from the poorer or&#13;
unemployed sections of society. The nature of recruitment ancd the regional&#13;
distribution of recruitment effort must influence the composition of migrant&#13;
--unfortunately there are no systematic studies of these effects.&#13;
There is more comparable evidence on the literacy and educational&#13;
status of temporary migrants. The proportion of illiterates among migrant&#13;
workers from Turkey increased during the 1960s as the share of village and&#13;
female workers increased. Even so, the proportion of literates--73 percent&#13;
and 34 percent in 1970 for males and females respectively--compares favorably&#13;
with 54 percent literacy in the population in 1970. A 1971 survey indicated&#13;
that 63 percent of migrants had elementary education (compared to 36 percent&#13;
in the total population), and 14 percent had secondary education (compared to&#13;
3 percent). Ninety percent of Yugoslav workers had completed elementary&#13;
school and 25 percent had secondary education (Paine, p. 79 and p. 192). A&#13;
Bangladesh survey showed thai: a great majority of migrants (82 percent) were&#13;
educated to below secondary school certification, but 10 percent had a&#13;
secondary school certificate (Ali, p. 40). For the Bangladesh population as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
whole the percentage in 1980 of adults ever enrolled in primary school is&#13;
estimated to be 68 percent for males and 32 percent for females (World&#13;
Development Report, 1984, Table 5). In the Indian state of Kerala, nearly&#13;
two-thirds of migrants had not completed ten years of schooling to qualify for&#13;
secondary school certification (Culhati, p. 2218). In the total population,&#13;
the percentage of adults over enrolled in primary school was 84 percent for&#13;
males and 48 percent for females in 1980 (World Development Report, 1984). A&#13;
survey of Philippino workers in the Middle East shows that about 30 percent&#13;
had completed high school and another 33 percent had completed college. The&#13;
Middle East group was significantly better educated, but the authors caution&#13;
that professional and technical workers were over-represented in the survey&#13;
(Smart and Teodosio, p. 15). Comparisons between migrant workers and the&#13;
total population are not always accurate because different concepts are&#13;
compared and because of sampling bias, but it does appear that migrants are&#13;
better educated. However, while not illiterate, a large proportion of&#13;
temporary migrants do not have high levels of schooling.&#13;
Migrant workers tend to be young adult males, and married, but these&#13;
characteristics vary across locations and over times. A German survey showed&#13;
that in 1968, 82 percent of Turkish workers were married, compared to 78&#13;
percent for Greece and Portugal, 76 percent for Yugoslavia and 71 percent for&#13;
all foreign workers. The proportion of single workers amongest departing&#13;
Turkish workers fell in the 1960s--from 40 percent in 1963 to 14 percent in&#13;
1970, mainly as a result of an increase in village departures, a higher&#13;
proportion of whom were married before departure (Paine, p. 77). A survey of&#13;
two villages in Kerala showed that all emigrants except one were males, and&#13;
half to two-thirds had been married--the lower figure comes from the villages&#13;
with a larger proportion of emigrants below twenty-five years of age ('-'"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
and Nair, p. 1146). A Philippine survey shows that 70 percent were married&#13;
(Smart and Teodosio, p. 14-15).&#13;
The proportion of women in these migrant populations either as single&#13;
workers or housewives tends to be low to start with but increases with tinme.&#13;
In Turkey, the proportion of women in worker depatrtures to Germany increased&#13;
from zero in 1961 to 24 percent in 1971. The proportion of women in the&#13;
foreign population in Germany increased for every nationality between 1960 and&#13;
1971--by 13 percentage points for Turkey, Yugoslavia and Spain, but 16-17&#13;
percent for Italy and Portugal and by 21 percentage points for Greece--as&#13;
migrants established themselves and sent for their wives, often so that they&#13;
could both work. Nevertheless even in 1971, the porportions were low for all.&#13;
nationalities except the Greeks, ranging between 20 to 30 percent--for Turks,&#13;
it was only 21 percent (Paines, p. 186, Table All).   A study of West African&#13;
migration estimated that around 1975 there were about one and a half times as&#13;
many males as females among Life-time immigrants into Ivory Coast and Ghana,&#13;
(the proportion was higher for immigrants of working age)--implying that about&#13;
38 to 40 percent of the lifetime immigrant population in these countries was&#13;
female (Zachariah, pp. 46-47). These proportions are higher than those found&#13;
in West Europe, probably because of longer periods of migration--for example,&#13;
in Ghana the sex-ratio (the number cf males per L00 females) among life-time&#13;
immigrants declined from 175 in 1960 to 152 in 1970. The proportion of&#13;
females among Greeks in Germany-longer-time migrants--was the highest (42&#13;
percent) among all foreign nationalities. Probably because large-scale Asian&#13;
worker migration to the Middle East is relatively recent (but for other&#13;
reasons as well) the proportion of women is extremely low.     However, a&#13;
Philippine survey found 19 percent of workers in the Middle EaLst were female&#13;
in the sample and in certain professional and service occupations--nurses,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
technicians, domestic and child are workers--the proportion was substantially&#13;
higher. These woman were generally unmarried (Smart and Teodosio, p. 13).&#13;
Women of other nationalities are known to have migrated for household and&#13;
nursing work to other areas of the world as well, including the United&#13;
States. This phenomenon remains unstudied but does suggest that the "males&#13;
first" or "males only" characteristic of migration is not universal.&#13;
In sum, the evidence is mixed in several counts. There is not&#13;
overwhelming evidence that migrant workers come predominantly from the ranks&#13;
of the unemployed, but some surveys indicated that the rate of unemployment&#13;
before departure was low to moderate. Rural migrants increased in Turkey, and&#13;
were predominant in the Bangladesh survey suggesting that migrants had&#13;
experienced some underemployment--although underemployment is not an&#13;
exclusively rural phenomenon. Surveys suggest that a large proportion of&#13;
workers (38 percent Philippines and 40 percent in Pakistan) are able to borrow&#13;
money to finance their departure; but it is not known whether these are the&#13;
poorest. Evidence presented earlier on how migrant workers find jobs suggest&#13;
that in many Asian countries, contacts with and help from friends and&#13;
relatives in the Middle East was important--this may be true of other&#13;
situations. Temporary workers appear to be somewhat better educated than the&#13;
general population, but educational levels are not very high for large&#13;
proportion of them. Migrant workers are usually married and male. However,&#13;
the West European experience shows that with time, women can increase as a&#13;
proportion, while the Philippine data shows that women can predominate in&#13;
certain occupations even to begin with.&#13;

IV. Effects of maigration on migrants and their families&#13;
Migrants' propensities to save and remit&#13;
Migrants earn substantially more than they would have and gain&#13;
opportunities for improving their and their dependents' standards of living.&#13;
There are also costs, of course, both financial and psychic: the latter&#13;
particularly heavy for temporary migrants who are forced to leave their&#13;
families behind for long periods of time.   But economic migration is&#13;
voluntary, indicating that net beneEits to the migrant and his dependents are&#13;
clearly positive.&#13;
A few examples illustrate the large income gains that migrants&#13;
experience. Paine notes that in 1971, on average, a Turkish worker in Germany&#13;
earned four times as much as he did before departure (Paine, Table 10, p.&#13;
102). More recent information on Middle-eastern migration shows that&#13;
Philippino workers in the production and construction sector earn about six&#13;
times as much while clerical and professional personnel earn nearly seven&#13;
times as much (Smart and Teodesio, p. 44). A survey of 200 Bangladeshi&#13;
returned migrants showed that even an unskilled worker earned, in the late&#13;
1970s, nearly, ten times as much as he did before departure while technicians&#13;
and professionals earned more than ten times as much (Ali, Table 31, p. 347).&#13;
Migrant workers tend to save a lot.   The average propensity to save&#13;
by Turkish migrants was 35 percent in 1971, and 47 percent if remittances are&#13;
included in savings (Paine, p. 102) (compared to a gross domestic savings rate&#13;
of 16 percent). A survey of migrant households in Pakistan estimates that the&#13;
average propensity to save (including remittances) was as high as 70 percent&#13;
(Gilani 1981, Part I, p. 105). Thus Asian workers in the MiddlLe East appear&#13;
to save more possibly becuase many of them have food and shelter provided for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
by employers. The average propensity to remit is also high for workers in the&#13;
Middle East, Pakistan workers remit about 50 percent of their income or about&#13;
70 percent of their savings (ibid). The proportion is higher in Korea where a&#13;
proprotion of earnings is compulsorily remitted. Eighty percent of Korean&#13;
workers' wages are directly paid in Korean currency to workers' families&#13;
(Kyong-Dong Kim, p. 6). The Institute of Labor and Manpower studies in&#13;
Philippines undertook a survey of 800 overseas workers in the early 1980s&#13;
which showed that on average, workers remitted 56 percent of their earnings.&#13;
Since the completion of the survey the government has required that 70 percent&#13;
of the incomes of seamen and construction workers and 50 percent of the&#13;
incomes of other land-based workers be sent home (Smart and Teodosio, p.&#13;
47). The proportions of income and savings sent home by Turkish workers in&#13;
1971 was however lower--li percent and 23 percent respectively. In other&#13;
words, Turkish workers kept a preponderant share of unspent income in Germany,&#13;
while the opposite appears to be true of Asian workers in the Middle East, if&#13;
the Pakistani data are typical of other such workers. One likely explanation&#13;
is that some Turkish workers in Germany were accompanied by their families&#13;
including children. In 1968, a German survey showed that 27 percent of&#13;
Turkish workers were with their families, and in 1972, 70 to 80 thousand&#13;
Turkish children were estimated to be living in Germany (Paine, p. 78,&#13;
footnotes 1 and 2). While the proportion of Turks with families was&#13;
considered small in relation to other nationalities in Germany it constrasts&#13;
with the situation of most Asian workers in the Middle East who are almost&#13;
entirely male and unaccompanied by family members. The need to remit appears&#13;
stronger in the latter situation. Earlier work by this author (Swamy 1981)&#13;
also showed that the greater the ratio of women to men in the migrant&#13;
population, the lower is per capita remittances, once income is controlled&#13;
for.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Effects of remittances on family expenditures&#13;
There are a number of studies that give information on how&#13;
remittances affect expenditures and savings. The central questions are&#13;
three: (a) what are the expenditure and saving patterns of migrant&#13;
households, (b) do these pat:terns differ distinctly from those of nonmigrant:&#13;
households and (c) do these differences conform to what may be expected from&#13;
any increase in incomes. The first question is of interest to policymakers&#13;
who may be interested in devicing schemes to alter spending and savings&#13;
patterns or in understanding the imipact of remittances on the economy.&#13;
However even in this case, comparison with nonmigrants is useful. For our&#13;
immediate interest which is to document the change that occurs with&#13;
remittances, comparisons with nonmigrant households are necessary. The Last&#13;
question is important because many critics argue that the benefits of&#13;
remittances are reduced because they (remittances) are spent in socially&#13;
unproductive ways--a criticism rarely made when incomes increase in other&#13;
ways.&#13;
The first question can be answered by surveying migrant households.&#13;
Since remittances add to household incomes, the logical way of answering the&#13;
second question is to compare households which receive remittances to those&#13;
t:hat did not, after matching the two for pre-migration status. Another useful&#13;
comparison is between pre-emigration and post-emigration expendutire patterns&#13;
of migrant households--many descriptive studies are of this nature. The last&#13;
question involves a comparison of the effects of remittances with economy-wide&#13;
marginal propensities to consume, save and invest. This issue remains largely&#13;
unexplored, but the first two questions have been adddressed in the&#13;
Literature. Some studies however attempt to measure how remittances are&#13;
spent.  If remittances form a large proportion of migrant household incomes, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
survey of migrant households would provide a good approximation to how&#13;
remittances are spent. When this is not the case, it is generally not&#13;
possible to relate specific expenditures to specific sources of income and ad&#13;
hoc and somewhat unsatisfactory procedures are used to do so (see below).&#13;
The study of Bangladesh (Ali 1981, pp. 81-137) relies on a survey of&#13;
migrant and nonmigrant households. In urban areas, the sample of migrant&#13;
households had, on average, incomes one and a half times as high as nonmigrant&#13;
households (the authors say that the difference is not statistically&#13;
different). Foreign remittances were the major source (75 percent) of income&#13;
for 62 percent of migrant households in rural areas and 47 percent in urban&#13;
areas.&#13;
The study did not find a significant difference between migrant and&#13;
nonmigrant households in the type of home-construction, source of drinking&#13;
water, type of toilets or type of fuel used for cooking. Nor was there a&#13;
significant difference in absolute consumption expenditures or the composition&#13;
of such expenditures. Clearly, migrant households saved more--average monthly&#13;
savings were 40 to 50 percent of income, compared to 2 to 4 percent for&#13;
nonmigrant households. While nonmigrant rural households spent significantly&#13;
less on consumer durables, there did not appear to be much difference among&#13;
urban groups. These was no significant difference in the amounts spent on&#13;
recreation, festivals, and ceremonies.&#13;
This survey makes possible a comparison of investment expenditure:&#13;
land, housing construction, housing improvement, agriculture, industry and&#13;
business are the categories for which data was collected. Here we summarize&#13;
the data on the number of households which invested in these assets and&#13;
average expenditures per household. Table 4 expresses the number as a&#13;
proportion of total households in the sample. It can be seen that in rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
areas, nearly 50 percent of migrant households had purchased land in the fOUr-&#13;
years prior to the survey, and 43 percent had undertaken new construction,&#13;
compared to only 16 percent and 24 percent respectively for the nonmigrant:&#13;
households. In urban areas a greater proportion of migrant households&#13;
invested in new construction and housing improvements--there is less of a&#13;
difference in land acquisition. Both migrant and nonmigrant households in&#13;
rural areas invested in agriculture, but investment in "industry" was&#13;
negligible. Investment in "business" appears to be reasonably popular for&#13;
all households in urban areas, and for nonmigrant households in rural areas&#13;
--however, less than 10 percent of migrant households in rural areas invested&#13;
in business. 2/&#13;
The Philippine survey referred to earlier (Smart and Teodosio)&#13;
compare pre and post migration savings and expenditures of about 800 migrants&#13;
households. Household expenditures doubled. But there was a sharp drop Ln&#13;
the proportion of income spent on household expenditures--from 82 percent&#13;
before migration to 29 percent afterwards as average income increased nearly&#13;
sixfold. Educational expenses on average formed over 20 percent of annual&#13;
income of households even bef'ore migration (unusually large, reflecting either&#13;
errors in measurement or a bias in the sample). Educational expenses after&#13;
2/  Data on the average amourLt spent by investing households on each of these&#13;
assets is more difficult to interpret because of price and quality&#13;
differences. For example, land-buying migrant households in rural areas&#13;
spent, on average 2.6 times ass much as nonmigrant households, however the&#13;
amount of land bought was only 1.5 times as big--the rest of the difference is&#13;
due to the price paid which probably reflects quality. In both rural and&#13;
urban areas, migrant households spent about 3 times as much on new&#13;
construction. Given the earlier finding that there was no difference in the&#13;
type of housing, this may ref'lect a difference in size of construction and/or&#13;
difference in prices of materials and labor.   Similarly, business investment&#13;
per migrant household in ruraLl areas was more than twice as large as&#13;
nonmigrant households, although a much smaller proportion of migrant&#13;
households relported having invested in business-clearly there were differences&#13;
in the kind oE business activity undertaken.&#13;

migration were almost three times as high, although only 10 percent of income.&#13;
(This contrasts with data from the Pakistan survey (see below) which shows&#13;
that expenditures on education and health were on average only 30 percent&#13;
higher in migrant households.)&#13;
The above mentioned survey distinguishes between two major kinds of&#13;
investments: cash savings and property. About three-fourths of sample&#13;
households reported to have had no cash savings prior to departure; only&#13;
one-fourth reported to not have cash savings after migration; the average&#13;
value of cash savings increased more than twenty-fold. The average value of&#13;
property (including houses and land) increased five-fold.   Interestingly the&#13;
value of cash savings after migration was almost equal to the value of&#13;
property held. The proportion of migrants who owned a house or a lot&#13;
increased by only 10 percentage points with migration, while the proportion&#13;
holding cash savings increased by 50 percentage points. In the Philippine&#13;
context, migrant households appear to have a strong preference for financial&#13;
savings, possibly because Middle Eastern migration to the Middle East is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
relatively recent phenomenon and because urban housing and larid is very&#13;
expensive (about one-third of the migrants in the sample were life-long&#13;
residents of Manila and another one--third had migrated to it prior to&#13;
emigration). Workers were asked to itemize all mortagages and debts held&#13;
prior to and after overseas employment. While 68 percent of the sample&#13;
---reported no debts before departure, this proportion rose to nearly 90&#13;
percent after migration, and the average value of debt declined by 30 percent.&#13;
A survey conducted in Turkey showed that about 40 percent of workers&#13;
had bought a house or a building plot; consumer durables came next (Paine, p.&#13;
114-120).  In addition, forty-six percent of rural workers andl 27 percent of&#13;
urban workers had put savings into a work-venture, i.e., buying land or farm&#13;
stock to set up small farmers, small-scale manufacturing units or commercial&#13;
businesses.  However, "participatory" type investments (which the Turkish&#13;
government encouraged), that. is, industrial partnerships and cooperatives&#13;
accounted for only a very small proportion of these work ventures, most were&#13;
investments into family concerns. About 37 percent of total savings brought:&#13;
back by returned migrants was spent on work-related goods.&#13;
The study on Pakistan (Gilani, Part I, Foreign Remittances: Analysis&#13;
and Data Issues, 1981) atterapts to estimate an expenditure and saving pattern&#13;
for remittances. All recurring consumer expenditures of migrant househoLds&#13;
over and above nonremittance income was presumed to come from remittances&#13;
--these expenditures were estimated to form 57 percent of remittances.&#13;
Expenditure on purchase or construction of residential houses; was estimated on&#13;
the basis of direct questioning--about 24 percent of those who lived in&#13;
own-housing had reported that they had financed the investment whoLly out of&#13;
remittances, while another 20 percent reported chat they had financed it&#13;
partly through remittances. By extrapolating to the rest of the sample, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
study estimates that 12 percent of remittances or about one-third of&#13;
nonconsumption expenditures was spent on buying or construction of a house.&#13;
Investment in other real estate (including agricultural land) is also assumed&#13;
to come from remittance income; this formed 20 percent of nonconsumption&#13;
expenditures. A comparison between migrant and nonmigrant households is used&#13;
to derive expenditures on house-improvement. Migrants households spent Rs.&#13;
658 extra on home-improvement, again assumed to come out of remittances. Land&#13;
and housing related expenditures thus formed nearly 60 percent on&#13;
nonconsumption expenditures. Industrial/comercial investment including&#13;
industrial machinery, collage industry, and transport vehicles for renting out&#13;
accounted for 22 percent, while agricultural machinery and inputs and&#13;
livestock accounted for 9 percent. Financial investments were negligible.&#13;
By this methodology, the authors are able to account for 97 percent&#13;
of remittances. But as can be seen, the allocation of particular expenditures&#13;
to remittance income can be quite arbitrary. For example, if 20 percent&#13;
migrant households partly financed buying a house through savings and not&#13;
remittances, they may have similarly financed home improvement or other real&#13;
estate investment. This methodology may also give a distorted picture of&#13;
consumption and savings habits. Data presented in the first part of the&#13;
Report (Tables 2 and 3) on income and consumption of migrant and nonmigrant&#13;
households showed that while the latter consume on average nearly all their&#13;
income, migrant households consume only three-fourths of their income&#13;
(including remittances). While the average income of migrant households was&#13;
two-thirds higher, consumption was only about 30 percent higher--migrant&#13;
households spent about 40 percent of the difference in income. However, by&#13;
attributing all excess consumption of migrant households (over nonremittance&#13;
income) to remittances, the authors estimate that migrant households consumed&#13;
nearly 60 percent of the increase in income brought about by remittances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Other evidence on how migrant households spend their income or how&#13;
they compare with nonmigrant households is based on less extensive data but is&#13;
nevertheless illuminating. A survey conducted in some parts of the state of&#13;
Kerala (India) in 1978 estimnated that in these arears, the average value of&#13;
assets (mainly land) per reporting (not necessarily migrant) household was ten&#13;
times as high as for the state on average (Commerce 1978). The study&#13;
estimated that a little less than 20 percent of annual remittances flowed into&#13;
commercial banks. Studies of villages in Mexico also show that acquisition of&#13;
land and holding is a predominant concern of migrant househol,ds--many tenants&#13;
and sharecroppers had thus acquired land in a society where "most wealth&#13;
(especially in the form of land) had formerly been acquired through&#13;
inheritance") (Cornelius, p. 47). There are reports of migrants investing in&#13;
small industr-y but it is not known if this is widespread.&#13;
The following tentative conclusions may be made. Migrant worker s&#13;
tend to save a high proportion of their income. Workers in the Middle East&#13;
appear to send a larger proportion of savings home than workers in West&#13;
Europe. Although the Bangladesh survey reports no significant difference in&#13;
absolute consumption expenditures between migrant and nonmigrant households,&#13;
the Pakistan study reports that consumption expenditures were higher by 30&#13;
percent in migrant households, while the Philippine survey reports a doubling&#13;
on average, of such expenditures after migration. The Bangladesh study&#13;
results not withstanding, there appears to be a susbtantive increase in&#13;
consumption. The proportiorL of income consumed however falls. Despite&#13;
differences in approach and methodology, all studies show that purchase of&#13;
residential plots, house corLstruction and house--improvement are expenditure&#13;
that receive priority. It is, however, not clear that these preferences are&#13;
peculiar to migrant househol.ds when compared to nonmigrant households with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
comparable levels of income. (Even in the Bangladesh study which attempted to&#13;
match the two groups for income the difference was too large.) Unfortunately,&#13;
investment in agricultural land (as opposed to building plots) is not clearly&#13;
distinguished in most studies. The Pakistani study shows that only 5 percent&#13;
of remittances was invested in agricultural land, but this study has&#13;
methodological constraints. In Turkey, about one third of returned migrants&#13;
who had work-related investments reported that they had bought fields and&#13;
orchards. Both the Turkey and Bangladesh studies report substantial&#13;
investments in priavate businesses and work-ventures; the Pakistan study&#13;
estimates about 20 percent ot total investment (out of remittances) are&#13;
expended on cottage-industry and commerical operations. However, this is not&#13;
a well-explored area.&#13;
In view of the limited discussion in these studies of investment in&#13;
agriculture, it may be worthwhile here to review in some detail Lucas' work on&#13;
effects of mine migration to South Africa on own-crop production and cattle-&#13;
investments (Lucas 1983B). A Cobb-Douglas production function (in per capita&#13;
terms) is specified for own-account crop production. Unknown fractions of&#13;
wage-earnings and crop-income are assumed to be saved and invested in&#13;
equipment, working capital, or technological improvement in traditional&#13;
agriculture. Wage-earnings comprise a weighted average of earnings of&#13;
domestic wage-earners and migrants. The results show that the capitalized&#13;
wage bill made a significant contribution to crop production in Botswanta,&#13;
Malawi, and South Africa. The capitalized crop income variable is not&#13;
significant when introduced with the capitalized wage-bill variable but is&#13;
significant in the Malawi equation when estimated without the wage-bill&#13;
variable). The capitalized wage-bill is also a significant variable&#13;
explaining size of cattle-herds in Botswana and Malawi, and less so for South&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
Africa.  Thus investments out of wage income (including migrant: labor income)&#13;
is seen to increase productivity of crop-production and increase the size of&#13;
cattle herds.&#13;
Effects of migration of males on women&#13;
Since temporary migration generally means that spouses and children&#13;
are separated from men for substantial period of time, there has been some&#13;
interest in the effects of migration (of males) on women and children.&#13;
Gulhati notes that in India, women and children are often left in the care oE&#13;
the migrant worker's parents or parent-in-law. There is also a high incidence&#13;
of female-centered households if the father or father-in-laws is dead, or old&#13;
and retired--in those parts of Kerala with large out-migration, such&#13;
households can be as high as 30 percent or more of all mgirant households&#13;
(Prakash 1978 and Mathew Nair 1978).   In Botswana, the 1971 census showed that&#13;
high proportions of single women--56 percent--in the age-group twenty to&#13;
twenty-four, and 29 percent iLn the age-group twenty-five to thirty-nine, with&#13;
1.6 and 3.4 children respectively (compared to 1.8 and 4.2 for all women)&#13;
(Kossoudji and Mueller, p. 835).   About 40 percent of households surveyed in a&#13;
Rural Income Distribution Survey identified a female as the head of the&#13;
household, nearly 70 percent of these (28 percent. of all households) had no&#13;
males aged between twenty to sixty-four present (ibid, p. 836). However since&#13;
men who were absent for six months or more were rnot counted as household&#13;
members, these proportions for female-headed households are difficult to&#13;
interpret. A later study (Izzard, pp. 677-94) found that in fact only 8&#13;
percent of the households surveyed were female headed households without adult&#13;
males associated with them in any way.   Another 28 percent were female headed&#13;
with adult maLes associated with the household but not necessarily present:&#13;
throughout the year.   While 85 percent of male headed households owned land,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
only about 70-75 percent of female headed households did. In particular, only&#13;
54 percent of those not associated with any males owned land. The same&#13;
pattern emerges with respect to ownership of cattle, and remittances. Only 30&#13;
percent of such households in rural areas received remittances, compared to 80&#13;
to 90 percent for other groups of female headed households.&#13;
The questions of interest is whether female involvement in&#13;
decisionmaking and labor input into crop production are higher in female-&#13;
headed households. The first issue--decisionmaking--is difficult to&#13;
evaluate. Many authors have pointed out that in Botswana (and probably&#13;
elsewhere) the decisionmaking process is rarely delegated to a single&#13;
individual (for example, the "household head") but is the result of decisions&#13;
made by different people varyingly associated to the agricultural unit of&#13;
production. Absent members may continue to significantly influence the&#13;
decisionmaking process. However, an indicator that may be examined as a&#13;
"decision" variable is the use of different agricultural inputs and&#13;
techniques. Data from the National Migration survey for Botswana shows that&#13;
about 60 percent of all kinds of households (including those not associated&#13;
with any males) were first-stage adopters, that is, used one or more of the&#13;
following inputs--fertilizer, improved seed or pesticides, and used their own&#13;
draught animals. A higher proportion of female-headed households not&#13;
associated with males, however, were nonadopters or did not go in for a second&#13;
stage of adoption (Kerven, p. 589). There is thus no indication that female-&#13;
headed households in general lag behind--whether this is because absentee male&#13;
heads nevertheless make the important decisions, is unclear. There is no&#13;
evidence either that investment in cattle or crop-production is affected by&#13;
the sex of the head of the household. Lucas (1982, pp. 643-46), drawing on&#13;
the same data, estimates investment functions for overall investment and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
investment in cattle-in neither of them is the dummy variable for sex of the&#13;
head of the household significant. (As in the results reported earlier, wage&#13;
income is an important explanatory variable, but whether these earnings are&#13;
earned by resident or absent members appears irrelevant.)&#13;
Unfortunately, there is not enough information in the survey on&#13;
whether women's participation in crop-production increased. Among those&#13;
owning land actual cultivation was seen to be lowest among the strictly&#13;
female-headed households--those not associated with males at all. A majorityr&#13;
of them stated that they had not been able to afford hired labor.    Arduous&#13;
ploughing tasks involve spanning and controlling oxen. A majority of these&#13;
women appear to have been unable to either perform this task themselves or&#13;
hire male labor. A similar response was given by a number of defacto female-&#13;
headed households who did not. cultivate their land. Thirty-four percent of&#13;
them stated not being able to afford labor, and 21 percent stated "husband not&#13;
here" as the reason.   Only 13 percent of male-headed households gave this&#13;
answer (Kerven, pp. 582-87). Thus there is some indication that women find it&#13;
difficult to perform some of the more ardous tasks and are unable or unwilling&#13;
to hire labor.&#13;
V. Macroeconomic effects of emigration and remittances&#13;
Important macroeconomic effects flow from the two related phenomena&#13;
--departure of- working age people and inflow of remittances. In the first:&#13;
round, emigration effects labor market variables--the availability and cost of&#13;
different kinds of labor and wage differentials--while remittances increase&#13;
demand for and prices of particular goods, services and assets.    It is worth&#13;
noting that for these effects. to be noticeable, emigration should be large&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
enough. If in fact migration is very small, or if there is a large pool of&#13;
unemployed and underemployed--as evidenced in few hours of work or very low&#13;
productivity--wages may not increase for some time as there is little effect&#13;
on domestic labor availability and on production. In situations of relatively&#13;
full employment of labor and capacity, however, production may decline and&#13;
efficiency suffer because vacancies (particularly skilled ones) are not&#13;
quickly filled, and complementarities between migrant and nonmigrant labor may&#13;
infact reduce production by more than the migrant's contribution. External&#13;
accounts of a country are also affected by remittances which can cover a large&#13;
part of a trade deficit, although the trade deficit may itself increase&#13;
because a part of remittance may be directly spent on imports. The first&#13;
round effects, particularly price effects, are usually felt most sharply in&#13;
the short-run when the supply of labor and other inputs, goods, investible&#13;
assets and techniques of production are relatively fixed.&#13;
The second round effects are likely to be more complex and involve&#13;
responses of households and producers to changed labor-market conditions and&#13;
to the increase in demand for particular goods and services. Some of the&#13;
possible response are stated below. The supply of labor may increase (in&#13;
response to higher wages) with higher labor force participation, and&#13;
nonmigrants may acquire some of the simpler skills lost with emigrants. On&#13;
the other hand, remittances may reduce participation by migrant households in&#13;
low-paying traditional work, including low-productivity agriculture. While&#13;
expenditures by migrant households on goods and services is likely to lead to&#13;
inflation in the first round, second round effects will depend on the supply&#13;
response. In particular, their investment in land and housing may increase&#13;
their prices sharply in the first round, the second round effects depend on&#13;
supply changes and what sellers, do with the money. Demand for imports may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
rise further as some nonmigrant's incomes increase--resulting in larger trade&#13;
desficits. Furthermore, the effects of remittances and emigration may&#13;
overlap.  For example, migrant households typically spend a lot on housing&#13;
construction.. If that sector has experienced large-scale emigration,&#13;
remittances will reinforce the effects of emigration.    The second round, often&#13;
interrelated effects are not easily identified particularly because of other&#13;
unrelated features of the domestic economy which cannot be taken into account&#13;
in a partial equilibrium framework. For example, it is not always clear that&#13;
traditional agriculture is abandone,l by migrant households because of scarcity&#13;
of labor; low expected returns may be the real cause of both emigration ancd&#13;
limited cultivation.&#13;
In the short to medium term, institutional factors and market&#13;
imperfections also play a role. Poor labor mobility between sectors and&#13;
regions of a country may accentuate wage increases in a sector or region of&#13;
emigration, but prevent these effects from being transmitted to other sectors&#13;
and regions. Similarly, if there are barriers to occupational mobility,&#13;
skilled worker shortages may persist for a long time.    These imperfections may&#13;
lead to persistent loss of efficiency and production. Supply barriers may be&#13;
created by government policies. For example, in many developing countries,&#13;
the urban housing market as well as the supply of construction inputs are&#13;
controlled--preventing supply from increases even as demand grows. Import&#13;
regulations and exchange rate policies can modify the effects on balance of&#13;
payments. Institutional factors thus make a full accounting of the effects of&#13;
migration even more difficult.&#13;
In the long run, the effects of migration may be similar to those&#13;
that arise from a slower rate of growth of the labor force, provided, of&#13;
course, that emigration is not a one-shot process but a continuous one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Continuing remittances may add to domestic savings and investment (but may&#13;
also taper off as migrants' length of stay abroad increases) Together these&#13;
effects are likely to generate labor-saving technological change, and possibly&#13;
to a change in the pattern of goods produced and traded.&#13;
While effects of migration can thus be complex, a review of&#13;
consequences is limited not as much by lack of a theoretical framework as by&#13;
lack of systematic study. The empirical literature on consequences is&#13;
extremely fragmented. Even first-round effects are not comprehensively&#13;
studied--while one study looks at wage effects another looks at effects of&#13;
remittances. Evidence on second-round effects is often impressionistic and/or&#13;
partial in nature; ignoring many important interrelationship and institutional&#13;
features of the economy. In the postwar decades, few countries (except some&#13;
island economics in the Caribbean) have experienced migration on a large scale&#13;
for long periods of time. The possible long-term effects have not been&#13;
studied intensively.&#13;
Effects of emigration on wages, labor availability, and output&#13;
In many of the countries sending labor to the Middle East, there is&#13;
evidence that wages increased, and wage differentials changed. Real wages of&#13;
unskilled construction labor in major cities of Pakistan increased at an&#13;
annual rate of 15 percent per year between 1972-73 and 1977-78, faster than&#13;
the rate of growth of wages of carpenters and masons, after remaining stagnant&#13;
for several previous years (Gilani 1981, Part I, p. 43). 3/ In the Yeman Arab&#13;
Republic, which experienced large-scale international as well as rural-urban&#13;
migration, average real wages of agricultural workers are estimated to have&#13;
increased sixfold during 1972-78. Rural wages rose from 56 percent to 63&#13;
percent of urban wages during 1975-79, and urban wages from 45 to 67 percent&#13;
3/ Nominal wages were deflated by the consumer price index for the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
of those in Saudi Arabia.   Female participation in the labor force although&#13;
still quite low is estimated to have increased by 3 percentage points in four&#13;
years--most of the increase was in t:he agricultural sector (World Bank&#13;
1979). In Egypt, the rate of increase of construction wages was more modest,&#13;
but over 6 percent per year during 1974-77, after stagnating in the previous&#13;
ten years (Choucri et al, 1978, p. 48 and World Bank 1981, p. 167). 4/ In&#13;
Turkey, Paine studied the movements of the wage-index by skilL for five common&#13;
occupations of migrants (before departure) and showed that in all five&#13;
occupatios the mean wages of unskilled workers rose faster than those of&#13;
skilled workers. Only in the city of Istanbul did the skill-differential&#13;
widen for three occupations--fitters, carpenters and brick-layers (Paine, p.&#13;
128).  Sizable wage effects must have occurred in a number of other countries,&#13;
particularly those experiencing large scale and skill-selective labor&#13;
migration, but data is not available.&#13;
Wage increases could reflect shortages in the short-run thus&#13;
affecting production.   Paine reports, however, that Turkish employers&#13;
generally had little difficUlty in replacing departing workers--although for&#13;
particular very skill-specific vacancies, such was not the case. Surveys by&#13;
Turkish Employers' Federation in the early seventies showed that while skil]Led&#13;
manpower requirements sometimes exceeded the supply, there had been no serious&#13;
and persistent shortage.   Most of the vacancies were filled comparatively&#13;
quickly--usually in the first three months after notification. Out of 54&#13;
firms surveyied by Krahenbuhl. in 1968 thirty-five reported that they had had no&#13;
difficulty in filling vacancies.   Positions reported difficult to fill w,ere&#13;
specialized machinery operat:ors in the textile industries and other general&#13;
operators required for main:enance (ibid).&#13;
4/ Nominal wages were deflated by the consumer price index for the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
The Bangladesh study (Ali et al, p. ix) states that "In the case of&#13;
export of educated and skilled manpower, it follows from interviews that&#13;
migration has had a disadvantageous effect on the domestic economy (through&#13;
resulting vacancies and appointment of less qualified people) in the following&#13;
occupations: medical specialists, doctors, and technicians; engineering&#13;
graduates, technician, and craftsmen, fibre technologists, and agricultural&#13;
professionals". This conclusion is based on a matching of the estimated&#13;
number of vacancies with the estimate of numbers who had emigrated during the&#13;
time of the interviews as obtained from a survey of 2325 establishments hiring&#13;
educated manpower. In most of these categories, (and including trained school&#13;
teachers) 10 to 15 percent of the total number of jobs were vacant at the time&#13;
of the survey, but for postgraduate medical specialists, vacancies were nearly&#13;
one-third. If those who emigrated had stayed home and with these&#13;
establishments, then the vacancy rates would have fallen to the range of zero&#13;
to 7 percent for most categories (excluding teachers for whom emigration data&#13;
(was not available), but vacancies would have remained high--13 percent--for&#13;
postgraduate medical specialists (based on data in Table 5.2, p. 161).&#13;
The limited evidence presented above and other more impressionistic&#13;
evidence suggest (a) that wages can increase quite sharply in particular&#13;
sectors or regions, (b) the unskilled-skilled wage differentials can change&#13;
and (c) that less-skilled workers are relatively easily replaced but vacancies&#13;
created by skilled and professionally trained workers are more difficult to&#13;
fill.&#13;
Whether higher wages and difficulties of replacing certain kinds of&#13;
skilled workers has resulted in loss of production or productivity at the&#13;
national level is almost impossible to assess because of lack of data and&#13;
difficulties, at the aggregate level, of isolating the effects of migration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
per se from other factors. In urban areas, there are reports of delays and&#13;
difficulties of hiring the right kind of labor for construction--yet in&#13;
neither of the two countries mentioned above where construction wages&#13;
increased rapidly--Pakistan and Egypt--is there any evidence that construction&#13;
output or employment declined. Infact, because of remittances, output and&#13;
employment hais increased rapidly in this sector. Paine reports for Turkey,&#13;
that the number of new houses built increased by 260 percent between 1962 and&#13;
1971, and employment in construction rose by 42 percent, 75 percent of thLis&#13;
increase was in housing (p. 140). In the Yemen Arab Republic, construction&#13;
sector employment increased by 77 percent between 1975 and 1979, comparecl to&#13;
15 to 20 percent increase in other sectors, and a decline in the agricultural&#13;
sector (Worldl Bank data).&#13;
In rural areas, the evidence, to the extent that it exists, is alsc&#13;
mixed.  Various case studies in Mexico have shonr that land is left&#13;
uncultivated after emigration. Joshua Richert reports, for example, that. ill&#13;
the town of Guadalupe (in the Mexican state of Michocan), "despite increased&#13;
acquisition of land made possible by U.S. wage-labor .... the actual number of&#13;
hectares under cultivation has decreased by as much as 50 percent since L960,&#13;
due to the growing number oi migrant landlords and the shortage of townspeople&#13;
willing to work as share-croppers"(as quoted in Weiner, 1983, p. 18).     SimiLar&#13;
results are reported by other researchers but Cornelius who studied nine&#13;
communities in Mexico, all with high emigration rates reports that&#13;
agricultural production was not depressed (ibid, p. 21). At the aggregaLte&#13;
level, the rate of growth oE agricultural output in Mexico during the 1970s&#13;
was a little over 3 percent, compared to over 5 percent during 1940-65, when&#13;
the Bracero' programme pulled out large numbers of agricultural workersl&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
In the Yemen Arab Republic where agricultural workers' wages&#13;
increased rapidly, the constant value of agricultural production (excluding&#13;
"qat") increased at a rate of 1.7 percent per year during the 1970s, and&#13;
possibly at over 3 percent per year if "qat" is included. Higher wages of&#13;
agricultural labor, increased demand for superior cereals and various&#13;
government pricing policies have, however, brought about significant changes&#13;
in the composition of agricultural output. Area under low-value cereals-&#13;
sorghum and millet declined by 35 percent between 1974-75 and 1982, and by&#13;
about 15 percent for barley. Area under wheat (a superior grain) increased&#13;
only marginally, however, because of government subsidized wheat imports.&#13;
Cotton area and production declined partly because of low administered prices&#13;
and higher wages, but also because a large part of labor required to produce&#13;
cotton is for hand-picking--its harvest competes with other high value crops&#13;
like vegetables and fruits, area under which increased by 41 percent and 20&#13;
percent respectively (YAR, Statistical Yearbook, April 1983). These crops are&#13;
relatively labor-intensive, but higher demand and prices appears to have more&#13;
than compensated for high labor costs.&#13;
Investment also appears to have increased. Irrigated area expanded&#13;
fivefold in the Yemen Arab Republic, the required investment was financed&#13;
partly through remittances. There was also a rapid rate of mechanization.&#13;
Purchases of agricultural equipment and machinery increased from 0.6 percent&#13;
of gross-value of agricultural production in 1972 to about 3 percent in 1979&#13;
(World Bank data). As noted earlier, a study of countries sending labor to&#13;
South Africa estimated that although ceterus paribus, increased nonfarm wage&#13;
employment (at home or in the mines) from any given level of adult population&#13;
reduced traditional crop output, in three out of four cases, wage employment&#13;
raised productivity through additions to capital stock, and the size of cattle&#13;
herds in Botswana and South Africa increased (Lucas 1983b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
In some Caribbean and other island economies with long-term and&#13;
large-scale emigration, extreme changes in output composition must have&#13;
occurred. Finkle and McIntosh (p. 77), for examlple, refer to the "collapse"&#13;
of the traditional sugar-cane and coffee industries in Puerto Rico under the&#13;
stimulus of Labor migration and massive infustion of U.S. capital.&#13;
Unfortunately careful study of other such phenomenon have not been made.&#13;
Estimates of loss of output have sometimes been made in the context of&#13;
cost-benefit analysis.   These estimates will be reviewed later (see below) but&#13;
it is worth noting here thal: such estimates are not always based on actual&#13;
data but on particular assumptions about the production value of different&#13;
kinds of labor.&#13;
Effects of remittances on balance of payments and prices&#13;
Table 5 gives data on flows of remittances and remittances as a&#13;
proportion of exports and oE national income in a recent year. (Historical&#13;
data on flows of workers remittances may be found in C. Swamy, 1981, as also a&#13;
discussion of determinants of remittances). As can be seen, remittances are&#13;
an important source of foreign exchange for a number of emigrant countries.&#13;
The extent to which migrants' and migrant households' expenditures&#13;
lead to an increase in imports is, unfortunately less well kiown because of&#13;
lack of data. A couple of studies have, however, reported on this and this&#13;
information is summarized below.&#13;
In Turkey, workers who beLonged to cooperatives werie not only given&#13;
priority in selection for emigration but also special concessions as to the&#13;
goods which they could impart on return--the main concession was the right to&#13;
import investment goods without applying for a foreign exchange allocation,&#13;
subject to certain limits on their value and the Length of stay abroad.&#13;
Similar import concessions were available to those workers who participated in&#13;
joint-ventures upon return., Unfortunately, data on these imports is&#13;

sketchy. Paine notes that infact few machines were imported under the&#13;
concession scheme as it related to co-operatives. One hundred and eighteen&#13;
items of agricultural machinery in 1970, 261 in 1971 and 487 upto July 1972.&#13;
The corresponding figures for industrial machinery were 58, 120, and 92&#13;
(p. 117).&#13;
More generally, to encourage migrant workers to bring back their&#13;
savings with them, the government introduced a special facility whereby such&#13;
workers could import certain commodities without allocation of foreign&#13;
exchange. Over the 1960s, the number of commodities which could be thus&#13;
imported increased to include many consumer goods. Paine (pp. 135-36) notes&#13;
the composition of these "workers' imports" during 1969-71--the main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
categories were vehicles and machinery (60 percent) but food and food products&#13;
were also important (16 percent). In 1969, cars amounted to 83 percent of the&#13;
vehicle category. As a proportion of total imports, workers' imports were 3.5&#13;
percent in 1970, and 2.6 percent in 1976--rather small. Such imports,&#13;
however, formed 12.5 percent. of workers' remittances in 1970 and 16 percent in&#13;
1976.&#13;
In Bangladesh, a wage-earners' scheme was introduced in the middle to&#13;
1974, by which a wage-earner abroad could use his earnings to directly finance&#13;
imports of certain goods or could sell foreign exchange directly or indirectly&#13;
through a nominee to an importer. The exchange rate which was determined by&#13;
negotiations between buyers and sellers (including the Wage Earners' Funds&#13;
Disposal Committee) was, on average! higher than the official rate by 30&#13;
percent in the late 1970s.   In the first nine months of 1979, about 69 percent&#13;
of recorded remittances were used to finance imports indirect.ly through the&#13;
wage-earners scheme, while about 19 percent was paid directly to suppliers by&#13;
migrant workers abroad (Ali et al, Appendix Tables 18 and 19, pp. 334-5).&#13;
The goods allowed under the scheme covered a wide-variety of items&#13;
including many not licensed normally. In 1978, essential consumer goods&#13;
(largely second-hand clothing) accounted for 13 percent, inessential consumer&#13;
goods (ranging from cars to toilet articles) accounted for 17 percent, and&#13;
capital goocls (transport and factory machinery) accounted for less than 10&#13;
percent. The largest item was raw-materials (64 percent) consisting of cotton&#13;
and syntheti.c textiles, yarn, chemicals, and irdustrial spare-parts (Ali et&#13;
al, pp. 75-77).&#13;
Thus in Turkey ancd in Bangladesh, some proportion of remittances (10&#13;
to 20 percent) appears to have been spent by workers directly on imports.    The&#13;
larger proportion was however available for all]ocation to planned, development-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
related imports. In Bangladesh, the design of the wage-earners scheme allowed&#13;
for greater market determination of the composition of imports paid for by&#13;
remittances. This has generated criticism along the same lines as those&#13;
leveled against "unproductive" use of savings from remittances by migrant&#13;
households; specifically, that many "inessential" goods not normally allowed&#13;
to be imported have been under the scheme and that imports of certain raw&#13;
materials and final goods (synthetic yarn and textiles, for example) may&#13;
retard growth of local industry particularly as consumers develop a taste for&#13;
imported goods. It is not known whether the Government introduced (or raised)&#13;
import duties on such goods to compensate producers.&#13;
Government policies can also alter the impact of remittances on&#13;
prices by appropriate monetary and fiscal policies. But if there are supply&#13;
inelasticities (as with the case of land), or additional productive capacity&#13;
is not forthcoming, prices are bound to rise. There is evidence from a few&#13;
studies that land prices increased rapidly. In a number of reas around Ankara&#13;
(in Turkey), the average annual percentage increase in land prices was about&#13;
or over 200 percent during th 1960s (Paine, Table A 44, p. 212), while the&#13;
increase in the consumer price index was 4 percent a year. Construction costs&#13;
(the cost per square meter) rose at about 6 percent a year during the 1960s,&#13;
somewhat less than the rate of increase of wages of construction workers which&#13;
increased at a rate of 8.5 percent a year. There is thus no evidence that&#13;
workers' demand for housing had an inflationary effect on house-building&#13;
prices. A village study in Kerala (Mathew and Nair), noted that in five&#13;
years, land prices increased 2.5 to 20 times. Land price increases must have&#13;
occurred in other emigration areas around the world, but are not well-&#13;
recorded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
The only study (to our knowledge) that takes a comprehensive approach&#13;
to the issue of macroeconomic effects of remittances is that of Choucri and&#13;
Lahiri which uses a short-run ten sector macroeconomic CGE model of the&#13;
Egyptian economy that emphasizes many structural characteristics.    In the&#13;
agricultural sector, competitive imports serve to clear the market with outplut&#13;
fixed and administered prices. In all other sectors domestic quantities&#13;
adjust to demand in the presence of chronic excess capacity.    Only in the&#13;
construction sector are prices allowed to adjust because of fixed capacity in&#13;
the short run.   Consumer behavior has been formulated on the bais of a linear&#13;
expenditure system of demand equations for determining the levels of sectoral&#13;
consumption. The major macroeconomic consequences of remittances are&#13;
classified as follows: (a) effects on sectoral output, (b) effects on&#13;
sectoral prices, (c) effects on income, shares---agricultural income, wages,&#13;
government profits and private sector profits, (d) effects on balance of&#13;
payments--changes in the level of competitive (agricultural) and&#13;
noncompetitive (other) imports.&#13;
Simulations show that a doubling of remittances would lead to an&#13;
increase in real output--mainly in the sectors Labeled "light industry" and&#13;
"rest of the economy", and an increase in the wage bill by 12 percent. Prices&#13;
in the construction sector would rise by 1.6 percent--because output is&#13;
fixed. This rise in price would not lead to inflationary pressures (the&#13;
aggregate price level increases by less than 0.2 percent) because of poor&#13;
linkages in terms of intermediate costs, but it does lead to a rise in profit&#13;
income in construction. Real value added in the economy increased by 6&#13;
percent. The net effect of a rise in remittances would thus be expansionary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
in real terms, but prices of construction and housing would rise by only about&#13;
2 percent--a small effect compared to a doubling of remittances, and further,&#13;
these price increases would have practically no impact on general inflation.&#13;
The authors recognize that these results are contrary to popular&#13;
belief and suggest that price effects are low because of the assumption of&#13;
excess capacity in several sectors, and the absence of an investment mechanism&#13;
which would link increased remittance generated demand to an increase in final&#13;
demand for investment goods and their prices. A third possible reason is that&#13;
the effects of emigration of large numbers of workers from the construction&#13;
sector is not considered. In the short-run model, wages are assumed to be&#13;
institutionally fixed.&#13;
Although the investment function is not directly tied to remittances,&#13;
the model is used to simulate the effects of an autonomous increase of 10&#13;
percent (in nominal terms) in aggregate level of investment demand, the&#13;
largest component of which is met by goods from the construction sector.&#13;
There is then a rise in prices of construction of 15 percent, and a 5 percent&#13;
increase in the aggregate level of prices. Real value added in the economy&#13;
increases by less than 2 percent, but over time, the rise in investment would&#13;
result in a larger physical stock of capital, counteracting the inflationary&#13;
tendencies by increasing aggregate supply.&#13;
As with any macroeconomic model, the results depend rather crucially&#13;
on the implicit and explicit assumptions made--in this case, the assumptions&#13;
of excess capacity and fixed wages clearly dominate the results of&#13;
simulation. Nevertheless, the study does show the need even if at a vastly&#13;
simplified level for a more comprehensive approach than generally adopted in&#13;
studying the effects of remittances.&#13;

VI. Cost-Benefit analysis&#13;
Theoretical issues&#13;
Assessments of net social lbenefits from migration also run into a&#13;
host of conceptual and ideological problems. There are two not unrelated&#13;
approaches to assessing benefits and costs. One is to concentrate on&#13;
particular kinds of migrants-skilled, unskilled and so forth--the emigration&#13;
of- each is than viewed as a project to be subjected to cost-benefit&#13;
criterion.  The other is to concentrate on economy-wide repercussions and&#13;
assess whether emigration contributes to overall growth and deivelopment. Such&#13;
an approach may also incorporate the project-type approach, and distributional&#13;
issues--distribution of income between different kinds of workers, among&#13;
regions and between labor and owner; of capital.&#13;
In both approaches a central question has been is that of whose&#13;
benefits shoUld be considered--the dlomestic population or the national (i.e.,&#13;
irncluding migrants) population. If emigration is more or less permanent the&#13;
right perspective may be domestic, while with temporary migration, a national&#13;
perspective may be more desirable since many migrants return.    But if&#13;
temporary migration generates net benefits for the migrant in terms of both&#13;
--current and future economic status, then a domestic perspective may continue&#13;
to be the better one. The proposition would be that since migrants are better&#13;
off now and in the future, society's concern should be with the rest of the&#13;
population.&#13;
Even when the group whose welfare is to be considered is identified,&#13;
there are othier unresolved issues. In the developmental approach, there are&#13;
differences in interpretation of benefits and costs, depending on what is&#13;
thought to constitute development. Those inclined to think of growth and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
development as a matter of capital accumulation and industrialization, view&#13;
migration as drawing off surplus labor, causing wage increases and stimulating&#13;
technological change, while remittances increase the availability of&#13;
investment resources. Those that have primary concern for distribution, local&#13;
development and social problems are quick to point out the costs--sectoral and&#13;
regional imbalances, decline in production (and possibly productivity) in&#13;
certain sectors, conspicious consumption and so on. Other scholars are&#13;
critical of emigration because they value national independence and they view&#13;
emigration in itself as a mark of dependence. While some of these asertions&#13;
are empiricaly verifiable they do represent rather sharp ideological&#13;
differences.&#13;
The major costs that enter the project-type cost benefit approach&#13;
(which is the one generally followed in empirical literature) are costs of&#13;
training, loss of production and social externalities. There is first, the&#13;
question of the cost involved in the production of the labor which is&#13;
exported. There are three major approaches to this issue. According to the&#13;
first, "opportunity cost" approach, since the persons are there anyway,&#13;
previous costs incurred in their upbringing (and education) should be&#13;
ignored. A second view is that the total (private and public) costs of&#13;
raising a child until working age should be taken into consideration since it&#13;
is a charge on the country's national income. This "real cost" approach&#13;
suggests that societies can actually decide whether or not it is advantageous&#13;
to bring up chidren for the purpose of export--a somewhat unreasonable&#13;
proposition in itself, but not entirely inappropriate when, as we shall see,&#13;
investment into higher education is considered. A third appraoch is a mix of&#13;
the two that says that costs of upbringing matter; but only to the extent that&#13;
the government subsidized these costs--this approach too has more relevance in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
thte context of skilled migration since governmenl: subsidies to primary&#13;
education and health, for example, are unlikely to be related to emigration&#13;
possibilities.&#13;
A second question iis whether ther is a Loss of production. If therie&#13;
is a pool of unemployed and underemployed workers, there may be no loss oi-&#13;
production and if the "opporl:unity cost" approach is used, no loss from the&#13;
transfer of human capital since past training costs (and investments into&#13;
training facilities) are to be considered as "sunk costs." But if there is&#13;
full employment of workers, or if the alternative "real cost" or "government&#13;
subsidies" approach is ued, positive costs can be estimated since resources&#13;
were used in training those that left, and additional resources would be usecd&#13;
for replacement workers.   (In addition, output would be lost or reduced during&#13;
the time of training replacements.) If training is to be formally acquired,&#13;
then the costs of creating acdditional training facilitate would also arise.&#13;
Social externalties figure prominently in calculations of social&#13;
costs of skilLed and professional emigration. Such workers are believed to&#13;
generate social benefits in the short-run and in the long-run when they&#13;
conribute, through research and innovation, to increase in productivity at&#13;
home. Market prices for their services do not always reflect these&#13;
externalities: their emigration therefore results in a greater loss in&#13;
welfare than implied by the loss of the money-value of their services.&#13;
Emigration can also prevent "internal diffusion"---skilled people--doctors,&#13;
nurses, and teacher, for example, from moving to backward or rural areas of a&#13;
country. Unlike the actual costs of education discussed earlier, these costs&#13;
are difficult to quantify. Most typically externalities are approximated by&#13;
increasing costs by arbitrary multiplicative factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
The major benefits of migration arise from remittances. In most&#13;
developing countries, savings are at a social premium, and we have seen that&#13;
migrant households have high average and marginal propensities to save,&#13;
although savings are not always "productively invested". Similarly, there is&#13;
a scarcity premium on foreign exchange, although migrants' own imports of&#13;
consumer goods may reduce the social benefits from remittances.&#13;
Estimating net social benefits from emigration is thus a tricky&#13;
business--a truly comprehensive calculation would need to consider not only&#13;
the (appropriately qualified) benefits of remittances and costs (includng&#13;
externalities) of training or replacing emigrants but also the short- and&#13;
long-term effects on nonmigrants' incomes, output, income distribution,&#13;
inflation, balance of payments, capital accumulation and so on. As we shall&#13;
see, most studies estimate net benefits after considering only a few if any of&#13;
these latter effects. However, even within this partial framework, some&#13;
tentative conclusions may be made. Regardless of the concept of training&#13;
costs employed, given remittances, net benefits are likely to be higher when&#13;
emigration involves unskilled, unemployed or underemployed workers since there&#13;
would be no loss of output or investment in human capital. Unskilled worker&#13;
migration may also improve income distribution if it raises wages of&#13;
nonmigrant unskilled workers, often the poorest in a society. Emigration of&#13;
skilled workers may result in lower social net benefits, although such&#13;
benefits may be quite differently estimated, depending on how training costs&#13;
are measured. In all situations, the higher the propensity to remit, and save&#13;
and lower the propensity to import, the greater are the net benefits. The&#13;
more "productively" remittance-enhanced income is invested, the higher the&#13;
benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Cost benefit calculations and skill composition of migrants-&#13;
Case studies: Bangladesh and Pakistan&#13;
The Bangladesh study (Ali, et al) estimates social costs and benefits&#13;
of labor migration using fairly detailed data on skill distribution and&#13;
distributional weights on consumption. It assumes that the social opportunity&#13;
cost of unskilled worker (output forgone) is nil in agricultuze and in urban&#13;
areas. Semi--skilled worker are assumed to be reLatiely easily replaced&#13;
through short on-the-job training oi- unskilled workers. Thus the only&#13;
relevant cost is the partial loss of- output during the period of training&#13;
which is assumed to be small. For skilled workers, the periocd of&#13;
apprenticeship is, on average, three years, during which time the worker is&#13;
assumed to be paid certain percentages of the fuLl salary. The study&#13;
acknowledges the difficulties of measuring the costs of replacing&#13;
professionally trained workers--the costs (if any) of additional training&#13;
facilities and of imperfect substitution. It states further that "most&#13;
professional and technical workers are employed either in government or in the&#13;
public corporate sector. The scarciLty factor does not play an important role&#13;
in the determiination of salaries in the public sector. Also, considerable&#13;
wage differentials exist between the public and private sector." Because of&#13;
these structural features which make it difficult to estimate the marginal&#13;
product, the study assumes that the opportunity cost is 25 percent higher&#13;
than the average earning level for professionals and 15 percent higher for&#13;
sub-professionals and technicians.&#13;
Remittances are valued according to whether they are spent or saved,&#13;
and different distributional weights are assigned to the increase in&#13;
consumption of different income groups among migrants.    Expenditures on&#13;
consumer durables are treated as consumptions, and expenditure on construction&#13;
is assigned a lower social value than "productive" investment. The net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
present value is estimated for each year of the migrant's stay (assumed to be&#13;
four years), and the unit of account is taken to be "free foreign exhcnage."&#13;
Output is valued at border prices, and distributional weights for increased&#13;
consumption of migrants' families increase as skill levels decline.&#13;
The results show that the single largest component of social costs is&#13;
the increase in consumption of migrant's families. Foregone output is&#13;
important, by assumption, for the skilled, professional, and technical&#13;
categories, but zero for semi-skilled and unskilled workers. The single&#13;
largest component of benefits is remittances and the estimated distributional&#13;
value of increased consumption of different income groups is small in&#13;
comparison. The authors conclude that the net present value from emigration&#13;
is not only positive, but quite large--the weighted-group average is $6,625 at&#13;
1979 prices. The benefit cost ratio is estimated at around three for semi-&#13;
skilled and unskilled workers, and 1.8 for professionals. Psychological and&#13;
dislocation costs are admittedly not considered, but according to the authors,&#13;
"the statistical magnitude of such cost components would have to be very large&#13;
to reverse our finding of sizeable net social gain from emigration.&#13;
The Pakistan study (Gilani et al, 1981, Part II) uses savings as the&#13;
numeraire and uses appropriate distributional weights for increase in&#13;
consumption of different income (skill) groups of migrants' families. Savings&#13;
of migrant families other than professionals are assumed to have been nil&#13;
before emigration and increase after migration. Unskilled labor and service&#13;
workers are assumed to have no replacement costs; for the rest, annual costs&#13;
of training are estimated. Remittances are considered a "cost" in that goods&#13;
and services are bought and are valued at border prices--the benefits from&#13;
remittances therefore accrue from the imposition of duties and taxes on&#13;
imports which contribute to public savings. Formulated in this way, net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
benefits from remittances are smaller than net benefits from increased&#13;
savings.  Net. benefits from emigration are highest for unskilled labor (the&#13;
benefit-cost ratio is 1.74) and lowest for professional workers (the benefit&#13;
cost ratio is 1.l)--results similar in pattern to those of the Bangladesh&#13;
study.&#13;
Skill composition of temporary workers-cross country comparisons&#13;
Different approaches and parameters may thus give different absoLute&#13;
values of net benefits--but both these studies indicate that the benefit-cost&#13;
ratios are higher for unskilled workers.   The larger the proportion of such&#13;
workers in the migrant labor force, therefore, the more likely it is that&#13;
emigration results in positive benefits. Table 16 puts together available&#13;
information on skill composition of temporary workers from different countries&#13;
in the Middle East, in Europe, and the United States. Some caveats are in&#13;
order. First, the skill composition does not always reflect educational&#13;
qualification because skills are often acquired informally through&#13;
apprenticeship, many poorly educated workers may be skilled. For example,&#13;
Gulhati (p. 2222, Table 3) notes that about 20 percent of migrant workers from&#13;
Kerala (India) in 1979 had not comp'Leted secondary education but were skilled&#13;
workers. Second, skills are not always classified similarly, intercountry&#13;
comparisons may therefore not be entirely appropriate, although data for&#13;
Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Yemen Arab Republic, and Sudan come Erom a single&#13;
(Serageladin et al) study and are comparable to that extent. The skill&#13;
composition ifor temporary wcrkers in the United States are derived by&#13;
aggregating (somewhat arbitrarity) different listed occupations as explained&#13;
in the footnote. Finally, it should be noted that there is sometimes a&#13;
difference between the skill of a worker before departure and his skill level&#13;
in the host country. While some workers acquire new skills, others may do&#13;

less skilled work than they are trained for. Bearing these caveats in mind,&#13;
it can be seen from Table 6 that a substantial proportion of mnigrant workers&#13;
are unskilled or semi-skilled. Migrant workers from the Yemen Arab Republic&#13;
were practically all unskilled.   So were a large proportion oi workers from&#13;
other countrIes that sent labor to ithe Middle East in the 1970s--ranging from&#13;
about 30 percent for Bangladesh and Jordan to about 50 percent for Egypt.&#13;
Unskilled workers comprised 30 to 40 percent of manual workers in Germany and&#13;
France and more than 40 percent of temporary workers admitted to the United&#13;
States in a recent year. About 50 percent of immigrants into Ghana and the&#13;
Ivory Coast are employed in agriculture, usually as laborers and illegal&#13;
workers in the United States ahve a large proportion of unskilled.&#13;
The brain drain and compensation&#13;
However, the table also shows that with a few exceptions, the share&#13;
of unskilled is not overwhelming. Even among temporary migrants there are&#13;
large proportions of skillecL and professional workers. Some 36 percent of&#13;
temporarily recruited migrarLts from Sudan, for example, were professionally&#13;
and technicaLly trained, ancl included as much as 44 percent of Sudan's&#13;
engineers, scientists, and medical practitioners. In Bangladesh, professional&#13;
and technicaL personnel constituted 17 percent cf total emigration in 1976-78,&#13;
and their departure is believed, as discussed earlier, to have contributed to&#13;
a shortage oE several types of professionals.&#13;
The proportion of skilled people in permanent immigration is&#13;
difficult to estimate because although the United States sets an overall lirnit&#13;
to professional immigration., family oriented immigration may also contain a&#13;
large proportion of skilled people. Permanent emigration also implies a more&#13;
extended absence; thus over a number of years, the impact may be greater.    A&#13;
measure of the impact of skilled permanent immigration may be gleaned from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
following figures. Between 1969 and 1979, the United States admitted nearly&#13;
500,000 professional and technical workers--three quarters of them were from&#13;
developing countries, nearly 50 percent from Asia. During the 1970s, they&#13;
accounted for nearly 30 percent of the rise in the employment of physicians&#13;
and related practitioners, for 12 percent of the increase in engineers and for&#13;
8 percent of the increase in scientists. On the sending country-side, certain&#13;
developing countries have experienced heavy brain drain. During the 1970s,&#13;
professional and technically qualified workers from Philippines who emigrated&#13;
to the United States constituted 12.3 percent of the increase in their numbers&#13;
at home; for Korea the figure was 10 percent. But professional and technical&#13;
workers who left Egypt for the United States during 1969-79 were less than 2&#13;
percent of the increase in their numbers at home, and Indian professional&#13;
emigration to the United States formed only about 1 percent of the stock in&#13;
1971. 4/&#13;
Social externalities, government subsidies, and the possible costs of&#13;
expanding training facilities become particularly relevant when considering&#13;
the benefits of professional migrations. Since families usually accompany&#13;
permanent emigrants, their enhanced savings become less relevant unless they&#13;
continue to remit and invest in the home country.&#13;
A study by Goldfarb et al. (1984) focuses on the issues in the&#13;
context of Philippine physician emigration specifically; it addresses&#13;
questions about the desirability of skilled migration despite large remittance&#13;
4/ All data on professional migration are from Immigration and Naturalization&#13;
Service of the United States. The data are not published but are available to&#13;
the public. Data on professional employment in the United States is from the&#13;
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and U.S. Bureau of Census as reported in the&#13;
U.S. Statistical Yearbook (various issues), for other countries the data comes&#13;
from ILO Yearbook of Labor Statistics various issues, tables on "Structure of&#13;
Economically Active Population" (with interpolation or extrapolation as&#13;
necessary between reported years).&#13;

fLows.  According to this study, in 1975, there were about 13,500 physicians&#13;
working in the medical field in the Philippines. By comparison, in 1974, the&#13;
number of Philippine-trained physicains in the United States Was 10,500; the&#13;
overwhelming majority were Philippinos born rather than U.S. nationals. The&#13;
United States stock of Philippine ph-ysicians was over 75 percent of the&#13;
Philippine stock in active practice in the Philippines.&#13;
The study asks two questions. First, if government is interested in&#13;
maximizing the welfare of residents, would it train doctors, but prohibit&#13;
emigration or would it offer the option of migrating.    Second, given that&#13;
migration is allowed, how can private and social gains be equalized.&#13;
Considering two values for externalities (from zero to 20 percent of&#13;
earnings), a range of values for the propensity to remit (5 to 10 percent of&#13;
income) and for physician irLcome in Philippines (from 10,000 to 20,000&#13;
dollars), they conclude that. migration would be the preferred policy when&#13;
externalities are zero, regardless of the values of other parameters.&#13;
However, when externalities are 20 percent (of earnings), the results, are&#13;
less equivocal.  They conclude that on the whole, "given that the Philippines&#13;
already has a migration-allowed regime (there is) no strong support for a&#13;
switch to a "'nonmigration" regime.&#13;
In a migration allowed regime, and where the number of doctors is&#13;
determined by private sector demand, how could social welfare be maximized?&#13;
The authors show analytically that for private cLecisions to produce a social&#13;
optimum, trainees should be charged (i) the full costs of training (minus a&#13;
correction for externalities produced by nonmigrating doctors), and (ii) a&#13;
correction for private gains from income abroad that is not remitted. Tllis&#13;
means that students would be charged amounts well above actual training costs&#13;
to achieve optimality and the excess could amount to a kind of tax on&#13;
unremitted future income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
The suggestion that professional emigrants be taxed has been made&#13;
explicitly by Bhagwati (1973 and 1982) and a number of reasons for such&#13;
taxation have been proposed by him and others--subsidization of higher&#13;
education, social externalities, prevention of internal diffusion, that is,&#13;
skilled people not moving to backward regions, and the "demonstration" effects&#13;
of emigration which push up salaries paid to professionals. These costs are&#13;
hard to quantify (as we have seen) and depend on each economy's institutional&#13;
features. Some of the costs may be reduced by a change in the policies of the&#13;
sending countries. There is, for example, little justification in subsidizing&#13;
higher education when the beneficiaries are the richer elite, or when the&#13;
probability of their emigrating is high. But, charging students full costs&#13;
may nevertheless fall short of achieving maximum social welfare. Similarly,&#13;
it is difficult to expect that professionals can be paid their social product&#13;
and thus dissuaded from leaving. If an immigrant doctor in the U.S. is paid&#13;
$65,000 per year, while he would make $16,000 in his native country, the&#13;
social value of his services would have to be large enough to quadruple the&#13;
payment for his services!&#13;
A more general basis for taxation arises because emigrants often&#13;
remain citizens of the sending country. Immigrant quotas also confer on&#13;
emigrants a rent which could be appropriated by society by auctioning the&#13;
quota, imposing an exit tax or by taxing emigrants' incomes. The last&#13;
approach is the most equitable since auctioning or imposition of an exit tax&#13;
could mean that only those who are already rich would emigrate.&#13;
One proposal is for emigrant countries collect such a tax, either by&#13;
extending the regular tax collection mechanism to citizens residing abroad as&#13;
the United States does, or by making passport renewal conditional on payment&#13;
of a graduated income tax as with Phillipines. How much would such a tax&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
yield?  If it is assumed that 90 percent of all professional immigrants&#13;
admitted to the United States during 1966-79 were still there in 1979, and&#13;
that within each major occupation, their pre-tax earnings matched average&#13;
earnings of Americans, their total earnings would have been about $6 billion&#13;
in 1979.  A L0 percent tax would thuas have yielded $600 million, about 13&#13;
percent of Official Development Assistance from the United States in that&#13;
year. 5/&#13;
VII.  Summary and Conclusions&#13;
Present-day scale of migration&#13;
An assessment of past and present trencls in international migration&#13;
suggests that compared to nineteenth and early t:wenieth centry migration from&#13;
Europe, the scale of present-day migration can only absorb a small proportion&#13;
of the increase in population of developing countries, althouLgh for some&#13;
countries, permanent emigration continues to be important.    Gross emigration&#13;
from Europe between 1851 and 1940 amounted to over 15 percent. of the increase&#13;
in population of Europe and for particular countries--the British Isles,&#13;
Italy, Portugal, Spain--the rate was substantiaLly higher.    At present rates&#13;
of permanent emigration less than 2 percent of the projected growth of&#13;
population in all low-income developing countries in the next: twenty years&#13;
would be absorbed. Temporary migration amounts to millions of workers,&#13;
however it constitutes only a smalL proportion of the labor Eorce in all&#13;
developing countries, althcugh for a few countries it is undoubtedly&#13;
5/ This caLculation uses several simplifying assumptions as mentioned and&#13;
provides onLy an order of magnitude.   Data on professional immigrants are from&#13;
INS sources.  Average earnings data for 1979 are from the U.S. Census Bureau&#13;
for physicans, engineers, rnurses, and scientists. For all others, average&#13;
weekly earnings in manufacturing industry was used as a proxy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
important. International migration therefore can be expected to have little&#13;
impact on populous countries even if the rate of growth of population&#13;
declines.&#13;
Immigration policies&#13;
Major constraints on international migration are the immigration&#13;
policies of host countries. These policies do respond to changing economic&#13;
conditions. One study suggests that in the United States, the timing of the&#13;
first quotas in the 1920s can be related to declining immigrant absorbtive&#13;
capacity, a decline in the elasticity of demand for unskilled labor and&#13;
smaller shifts in the demand for such labor as farmland growth declined and&#13;
biased technological change favored capital and skill. The more recent&#13;
experience of physician immigration into the United States shows further that&#13;
when there is a sudden increase in demand for professionals as for example&#13;
following an increase in the so-called third party payments for medical care&#13;
of the poor and elderly immigration rules are eased, only to be tightened up&#13;
when the scarcity eases. Construction and service worker migration to the&#13;
Middle East can be directly linked to sudden oil-related increase in incomes&#13;
but also to low participation rates by domestic workers in these&#13;
occupations. It has also been suggested that foreign labor imports are used&#13;
by industrialized countries to preserve competitiveness in labor-intensive&#13;
industries which are losing effective protection. For example, foreign&#13;
workers in the West German textile industry doubled in the second half of the&#13;
1960s, as total employment and effective protection declined.&#13;
But immigration policies tend to become more restrictive over time&#13;
and once restrictions are put in place, they are difficult to alter. Compared&#13;
to early decades of this century, the post-war (Second World War) years in the&#13;
United States saw the reemergence of good economic conditions, but there was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
no significant relaxation of the ceiling on immigrants.    In West Europe,&#13;
although the oil crisis of 1973 precipitated a sharp change in policy towards&#13;
restricting i-oreign workers, there is evidence that host country governments&#13;
began to impose restrictions earlier--in 1971 and 1972--because of the social&#13;
and political problems of managing a large foreign populations.    Migration had&#13;
taken on a circulatory character as the same workers returned and the length&#13;
of stay increased. These examples suggest that problems of social integration&#13;
become particularly difficult as immigrants increase as a proportion of the&#13;
population, and receive increasing attention. In the long-run these factors&#13;
may be more important than purely economic ones in limiting immigration.&#13;
The supply response&#13;
Although the scale of migration is largely determined by host-country&#13;
policies, the question nevertheless arises as to what factors determine supply&#13;
from different countries. There is a general tendency for lower-wage&#13;
countries in the neighborhood of a host country to supply labor because&#13;
shorter distances ease the iFlow of information and minimize financial and&#13;
psychic costs. However because migration data records actual arrivals which&#13;
may be influenced by host countries' preferences as well, it is difficult to&#13;
estimate the differential supply response of labor exporting countries Lo&#13;
income differentials. Two studies, one of application for labor certification&#13;
in the United States and another of supply of nonwhite labor to South African&#13;
mines up to 1974 (when mining houses had no preference for any particular&#13;
source of such labor) shows that actual or expected wage differentials between&#13;
host and sending countries' wages influence potential or actual supply from&#13;
different countries. In the U.S. study, ability to speak English was also a&#13;
significant factor and in countries supplying labor to South African mines,&#13;
more successiful harvest or ample rainfall significantly reduced the incidence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
of mine work, while population growth increased it. Wage differentials also&#13;
appear to influence host country preferences. A study of the German&#13;
guestworker program estimated that the share of incremental inflow of workers&#13;
from each of the five major source countries was positively related to growth&#13;
of population and negatively to wage levels in the sending countries.&#13;
According, between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s, the nationality composition of&#13;
foreign workers changed in favor of the relatively poorer "new" exporters&#13;
--Turkey and Yugoslavia--while the proportion of Greeks declined. In the&#13;
Middle East, the latter half of the 1970s saw an increase in the proportion of&#13;
non-Arab workers at least partly because Asian workers accepted lower wages.&#13;
Thus both, host country preferences and supply appear to respond to wage&#13;
differentials.&#13;
An important question in the context has been whether the Government&#13;
of a labor exporter can increase its share of the migrant labor force by&#13;
increasing the flow of information, actively participating in the recruitment&#13;
process and by responding in a flexible way to host countries' demands.&#13;
Unfortunately, although many labor exporters in Asia have attempted to do so,&#13;
there has been no systematic study of the impact of such efforts. An&#13;
acknowledged success story in the Middle East context is the package approach&#13;
that Koreans have adopted in which Korean workers are hired by a Korean firm&#13;
which has a contract in the host country. By the end of 1980, nearly all&#13;
Korean workers with the Middle East were employed by Korean companies. Less&#13;
successful have been state operated recruitment agencies; in Bangladesh and&#13;
Pakistan, for example, only a quarter to a third of migrants had been placed&#13;
through a state agency--60 to 75 percent had found jobs through their own&#13;
efforts and the assistance of friends and relatives. Governments have also&#13;
tried to regulate the operations of private recruiting agents to prevent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
exploitation.  Thus government interventions have varied and not all of them&#13;
have the potential to increase sending countries' market share-in fact,&#13;
attempts to regulate private agents and protect workers' rights could have the&#13;
opposite effect since one cotntry's efforts to improve the situtation of their&#13;
workers abroad can lead to ut:ilization of more labor from a less demanding&#13;
neighbor.&#13;
Migrant's characteristics&#13;
At the micro level, an important question has been that: given the&#13;
uncertainty, which individuals try or actually migrate to a foreign country.&#13;
There has been little by way of econometric analysis of this question, but&#13;
data collected in surveys (generally of temporarF workers) provide some&#13;
description of economic and personal characteristics. The financial costs oE&#13;
migration can be large: the cost of passage (when employers do not pay for&#13;
passage), minimum amounts of foreign exchange that migrants may be required to&#13;
or want to carry, obtaining various documents and, quite often, payments under&#13;
the counter.  Borrowing from friends and relatives is quite common.    Surveys&#13;
indicate that 40 percent of workers from Pakistan, 30 to 80 percent from&#13;
India, and 25 percent from the Philippines has borrowed money to finance&#13;
migration. Migration is thus difficult for the poor or unemployed suggesting&#13;
that migrants may not typicaLly come from the lowes income groups or from the&#13;
ranks of the unemployed.   The few surveys that record employment status before&#13;
departure show that open uneinploymerLt before migration was infact low to&#13;
moderate--4 percent in Turkey in 1971, 7 percent in Pakistan, 9 percent in&#13;
Philippines and about 12 percent in Bangladesh. Larger proportions,&#13;
particularly in rural areas may have been underemployed in the sense of low&#13;
productivity and/or few hours of work--but this is not possible to establish,&#13;
although in Bangladesh 78 percent of migrants (in a sample survey) had come&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
from rural areas and in Turkey the proportion of rural migrants increased over&#13;
time. Surveys do indicate, however, that the majority of temporary migrant&#13;
workers are better educated than the general population although not very&#13;
highly eduated (that is, beyond secondary school). Migrant workers tend to be&#13;
young adult males and married. The proportion of women in migrant populations&#13;
is low to start with but tends to increase oer time as migrants establish&#13;
themselves and send for their wives. The proportion of women in the foreign&#13;
population resident in Germany increased between 1960 and 1971--by 13 to 17&#13;
percentage points for most natinalities, but 21 percent for Greece. Women,&#13;
generally unmarried, have migrated for household and nursing work--19 percent&#13;
of Philipino workers in a sample survey were women--but such migration is not&#13;
yet very significant.&#13;
Migrant's saving and remittances and effects on family expenditures&#13;
The average propensity to save (including remittances) is usually&#13;
high--surveys indicate that Turkish workers in 1971 saved 47 percent of their&#13;
income, and Pakistani workers saved about 70 percent in the late 1970s. The&#13;
propensity to remit is high among workers in the Middle East 50 to 60 percent&#13;
--but was lower for Turkish workers--only 11 percent reflecting the fact that&#13;
a significant proportion of Turkish workers were accompanied by their&#13;
families, including children. The effects of remittances on family&#13;
expenditures are best brought out by either comparing migrant family&#13;
expenditures with those of nonmigrants (after matching for pre-emigration&#13;
status) or by comparing pre-emigration and post-emigration expenditure&#13;
patterns of migrants. In Bangladesh a study of the former kind found no&#13;
significant difference in absolute consumption expenditures or in its&#13;
composition between migrant and nonmigrant households, nor a significant&#13;
difference in the amounts spent on recreation, festivals and ceremonies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
However, migrant households clearly saved more arkd higher proportions of them&#13;
invested in land (30 percent more in rural areas," and new construction (15&#13;
percent more in urban areas and 19 percent in rural areas).    Other surveys of&#13;
migrant workers and case studies have reiterated this finding of a pronounced&#13;
preference for housing, land, and new construction.&#13;
Data on the extent to which households invest in financial assets and&#13;
industrial and commercial ventures are generally lacking.    Three studies&#13;
suggest that such investments may not be insignificant.    A Philippines survey&#13;
that compares pre and post migration savings and expenditure patterns showed&#13;
cash savings to be an important form of saving for migrant households--the&#13;
proportion of households having cash savings increased from one-fourth to&#13;
three-fourth. While about 3CI percent reported owing a debt before departure,&#13;
only 10 percent did after departure.   On the other hand, the proportion ofE&#13;
migrants who owned land increased by only 10 percentage points. In Turkey, a&#13;
substantial proportion of workers (almost equal to the proportion who bought&#13;
houses or building plots) put savings into work ventures--in agriculture,&#13;
small commerce and industry. An econometric study of mine--migration to 'South&#13;
Africa estimated indirectly that investment out of wage income made a&#13;
significant contribution to crop and cattle production.&#13;
Macroeconomic effects of emigration: wages, labcr availability,&#13;
and balance of payments&#13;
In the first round, emigration, provided it is large enough, affects&#13;
labor market variables--the availability and cost of different kinds of&#13;
labor--while remittances increase demand for and prices of goods, services,&#13;
and assets.   The first round effects are felt most sharply in the short-run&#13;
when the supply of labor, other inputs, and techniques of production are&#13;
reLatively fixed.   Production and efficiency in particular sectors may suffer&#13;
because vacancies are not quickly filled and prices of those goods and assets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
which are in inelastic supply--land and housing for instance--may increase&#13;
sharply. Second round effects are more complex and involve responses of&#13;
households and producers to changed labor-market conditions and to increases&#13;
in demand for goods and services. Participation rates may rise or fall and&#13;
additional skills may be acquired and the supply of goods may increase either&#13;
domestically or through imports. Institutional factors, market imperfections&#13;
and government policies may modify these responses--poor labor mobility may&#13;
accentuate wage increases in one region or sector but prevent the transmission&#13;
of wage increases to other sectors and regions. While effects of migration&#13;
and remittances can thus be complex, a review of consequences is limited not&#13;
as much by lack of a theoretical framework as the lack of data and systematic&#13;
study. The empirical literature is extremely fragmented--while one study&#13;
looks at wage effects, another looks at land prices.&#13;
Data, to the extent available, do show that migration has resulted in&#13;
sharp increases in wages-construction wages in Pakistan and Egypt and&#13;
agricultural wages in YAR are examples. In Pakistan and Turkey, real wages of&#13;
unskilled workers increased faster than those of skilled workers. Survey data&#13;
from Turkey and Bangladesh also show that workers having specialized skills&#13;
--machinery operators in Turkey, medical specialists in Bangladesh--are&#13;
difficult to replace while less skilled workers are easily replaced. W'I&#13;
emigration lead to a decline in (or lower rate of growth of) production in the&#13;
short-run is almost impossible to assess. But construction sector output does&#13;
seem to have increased substantially in most of these countries, partly&#13;
because of remittances.&#13;
Some case studies in Mexico have shown that in rural areas land is&#13;
left uncultivated after emigration despite increased land acquisition WI'&#13;
others have reported that agricultural production was not depressed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
Yemen Arab Republic, higher wages of agricultural labor, increased demand for&#13;
superior cereals coupled with investment in irrigation financecl partly through&#13;
remittances brought about significant changes in area and production-away from&#13;
low-value cereals towards higher value-crops like fruits and vegetables.&#13;
Remittances are an important source of foreign exchange for a number&#13;
of labor exporters--constituting 45 to 80 perceni: of export eaL-nings for&#13;
countries like Portugal, Yemen Arab Republic, Pakistan, and Yugoslavia.    In&#13;
many instances however, remittances have lead directly to higher imports,&#13;
of'ten because of government schemes that provide special import facilities for&#13;
remittances. Such imports accountecd for 10 to 20 percent of remittances in&#13;
Bangladesh and Turkey for which data are available. Remittances have also&#13;
been documented to increase land prices in India and Turkey.&#13;
As mentioned earlier, a comprehensive approach to analysing effects&#13;
of migration and remittances has generally been lacking. One study which&#13;
employes a CCE model for Egypt, for example, simulated that a doubling of&#13;
remittances would lead to a 2 percent increase in construction sector prices&#13;
--an unexpectedly small increase--partly because in this short-run model,&#13;
wages were assumed to be fixed, even in the construction sector which&#13;
experienced large-scale migration.&#13;
Costs and benefits to sending countries&#13;
The estimation of costs and benefits runs into a host of conceptual&#13;
and data problems. Central questions have been those of whose benefits should&#13;
be considered, how the major costs--training and. replacement costs, value of-&#13;
loss of production, and social externalities should be measured.   Further,&#13;
cost benefit evaluation has generally concentrated on particular kinds of&#13;
migrants, the emigration of each is then viewed as a project to be subjected&#13;
to cost-benefit criterion. This approach is partial in nature since it does&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
not always take into account effects on nonmigrants, or inflation, balance of&#13;
payments, etc. However, even within this partial framework, case studies have&#13;
shown that given high propensities to save and remit, net benefits are likely&#13;
to be higher when emigration involves unskilled unemployed or underemployed&#13;
workers since there is little loss of output or investment in human capital.&#13;
The larger the proportion of such workers in the migrant labor force,&#13;
therefore, the more likely it is that emigration results in positive&#13;
benefits. Available information on skill composition of temporary workers in&#13;
the Middle East, Europe, and the United States shows that a substantial&#13;
proportion of such workers were unskilled, ranging from 30 to 50 percent in&#13;
Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India to 90 percent in the Yemen Arab Republic.&#13;
However with a few exceptions, the share of the unskilled is not overwhelming&#13;
and data on professional and technical immigration into the United States from&#13;
developing countries shows that for many of them, professional emigration was&#13;
significant. Social externalities, and the higher (public) costs of higher&#13;
education would reducethe net benefits from migration. In addition, many have&#13;
argued that the possibility of migration creates "demonstration" effects on&#13;
salaries and prevents internal diffusion. The idea that professional&#13;
emigrants should therefore be taxed has explicitly been made, particularly&#13;
since most long-term emigrants remain citizens of their home countries and&#13;
immigration quotas confer on them a rent which should be appropriated by the&#13;
sending country. Some countries--the United States, for example--tax their&#13;
citizens living and earning abroad--but international mechanisms for such&#13;
taxation do not exist. A rough calculation shows that under certain&#13;

        <abstracts>
            International migration is a conspicuous
            form of population interaction between richer and poorer
            countries. This paper makes an assessment of the dimensions
            of past and present day migration, its determinants, the
            effects on sending countries, costs and benefits and the
            nature of constraints on free movement of people. Available
            data on (temporary) migrant characteristics is put together
            to analyze which individuals try to or actually emigrate.
            Although data do not permit clear conclusions, they suggest
            that the financial costs of migration can be high thus
            making it difficult for the very poor or unemployed to
            migrate. Data on migrant's savings and remittances and
            the effects of remittances on family expenditures is
            examined to show that migrants and their household are high
            savers and there is a pronounced preference for spending on
            housing, land, and new construction. The paper attempts a
            discussion of the major issues in cost-benefit analysis and
            summarizes a few studies which show that the benefits are
            likely to be greater when emigration involves relatively
            unskilled workers. Available information on skill
            composition of temporary worker migrants is analyzed to show
            that for many sending countries, the proportion of unskilled
            and semiskilled workers is substantial.
