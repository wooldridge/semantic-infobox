&amp;#12;&#13;
        This note is an attempt to analyze the essential role that structural reforms have&#13;
played in the recent development of the Vietnamese economy, highlight the reasons for&#13;
the current economic slowdown, and argue for the need to accelerate an intensive reform&#13;
program to enable sustainable growth in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
        Vietnam has traveled on a long and arduous road of development, from an&#13;
extremely difficult period (1986-89) through a first wave of comprehensive structural&#13;
reforms with solid achievements (1990-95). Since then, the momentum for reforms and&#13;
growth has slowed down (Box 1). The positive impacts of the first reform wave have&#13;
reached the end and outlived their usefulness. These reforms could no longer address a&#13;
set of newly emerging challenges facing Vietnam on its way toward a fully functioning&#13;
market economy. Many constraints and bottlenecks in the current structure have been&#13;
revealed and most of them have not been tackled adequately, timely, and forcefully. The&#13;
East Asia financial turmoil helped bring these into the open and under closer scrutiny.&#13;
These structural disadvantages and constraints reflect the inefficient resource allocation&#13;
with a bias toward investments in import-substituting industries, and the reliance of the&#13;
economy on highly protected and inefficient state enterprises -- often monopolies --&#13;
within a subsidized, unhealthy, and inefficient financial and banking system.&#13;
&#13;
        Results from a 1997 analysis by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) indicate that 46&#13;
percent of the 5,800 State-owned enterprises (SOEs) incurred losses with a disturbing&#13;
debt/equity ratio of nearly 100 percent; more than half of total corporate debts are&#13;
probably unrecoverable. Inefficient SOE operations impose a negative impact on the&#13;
economy's competitiveness through four major channels. First, consumers are forced to&#13;
accept overpriced but low-quality products from inefficient SOEs, while they are&#13;
restricted in the choices of commodities sold domestically due to import restrictions.&#13;
Second, protected SOEs tend to misallocate and waste scarce resources.           Third, the&#13;
monopolistic nature of SOEs in several industries is a formidable entry barrier for other&#13;
non-state enterprises, thereby preventing the development of a multi-sector economy.&#13;
Finally, with easy and preferential access to credit sources and interest subsidies, SOEs&#13;
create unavoidable risks in banking operations, threatening not only the banking system's&#13;
health but also the country's socio-economic stability.&#13;
&#13;
      Protection for import-substituting industries such as steel, cement, sugar, etc. leads&#13;
to an domestic over-supply of these products. Produced at higher costs, these products&#13;
are more expensive than imported goods, but usually with lower quality, leading to large&#13;
accumulated inventory, contributing to the current economic slowdown and deflation.&#13;
Production contraction in some protected industries such as cement, sugar, and steel, etc.,&#13;
requires the granting of additional privileges to these industries, not only in terms of&#13;
higher trade barriers but also in preferential credits, etc.      While the government's&#13;
temporary bans on import of these goods can keep these industries afloat in the short-&#13;
term, these restrictions eliminate an opportunity to force loss-making SOEs to restructure&#13;
themselves and enhance their efficiency. More importantly, this protection mechanism&#13;
always breeds more needs for additional protection at a higher level while the cost of this&#13;
inefficiency is transferred unequitably to other economic groups of the society, especially&#13;
those who live in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Import restrictions, especially non-tariff barriers, not only adversely affect domestic&#13;
investment and production, but they also create distorted and wrong signals to foreign&#13;
investors. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in recent years has been concentrated on&#13;
import-substituting industries through joint-ventures with state enterprises.         Foreign&#13;
investors rush in to seek economic rents from investments in highly protected industries,&#13;
creating oversupply and stockpiled products. The automobile industry is such a case with&#13;
11 joint-ventures from 14 registered projects.       This situation leads to surpluses and&#13;
difficulty for domestic production, given the small and saturated automobile market in&#13;
Vietnam. Some of the foreign investors enjoy substantial economic rents and privileges&#13;
from protection and take away such rents from poor Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
      Instead of making good use of their privileged access to preferential credit sources,&#13;
especially through state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), SOEs' inefficiency and poor&#13;
performance foster unhealthy operations in the banking sector. SOCBs lend to SOEs&#13;
without collateral and take away the limited credits needed for other pressing&#13;
development projects, such as the development of physical and social infrastructure,&#13;
especially in rural areas. Unrecoverable amount of corporate debts increases as poor&#13;
enterprises cannot repay their debts easily. If SOEs cannot service their overdue debts,&#13;
the government as the fund provider of last resort, will need to intervene by injecting&#13;
additional capital to the banking system, committing large amounts of money from future&#13;
revenues, thus creating fiscal instability.&#13;
&#13;
      Recent measures focus on demand stimulation by easy monetary and fiscal&#13;
management and boosting investment and purchasing power, including lending rates&#13;
reduction, larger fiscal deficit target, and proposal to increase civil servants' salary. In&#13;
addition, the government mobilizes thousands of billion dong from the banking sector&#13;
and budget to expand "directed lending" to on-going projects that are largely&#13;
implemented by inefficient SOEs. However, these short-term measures are only able to&#13;
treat the symptoms of economic ills but do not strategically address deeper and root&#13;
problems underlying the current economic recession.&#13;
&#13;
      Some of the current long-term measures underway are either delayed or untimely,&#13;
or are not strong enough to revive the growth momentum. For trade reforms, although&#13;
Vietnam has already committed to AFTA plan, an actual schedule for gradual tariff&#13;
reduction with annual targets is not available. In the mean time, existing non-tariff&#13;
barriers are not dismantled, on the contrary they are being reinforced in the short-run. In&#13;
1998, due to the accumulated inventory and production slowdown of several import-&#13;
substituting goods, nine commodities were added to the temporary goods list with&#13;
restricted import quantity. To date, there is no commitment to a timetable for dismantling&#13;
non-tariff-barriers.&#13;
&#13;
      SOE reforms have been discussed countless times, but to date, there has not been&#13;
any actual reform timetable plan that specify clearly SOE classification and measures to&#13;
be undertaken. Although the decree on transfer, sale, lease, and management contract has&#13;
been promulgated, SOE reforms are still operating within the equitization framework that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
proceeds very slowly. There is yet no clear policies to treat large SOEs with losses or&#13;
poor performance.&#13;
&#13;
      While progress has been made in the promulgation of two banking laws and&#13;
implementing decrees to strengthen the legal prudential basis, reforms in the banking&#13;
system lack an action plan with measures and timetables to separate non-commercial&#13;
lending activities from SOCBs, to restructure joint-stock banks (JSBs) and SOCBs, to&#13;
build an accounting and supervision framework consistent with international standards.&#13;
&#13;
      The current economic problems have received just far only superficial treatment&#13;
which only address symptoms of illness.         More effective and intensive structural&#13;
measures need to be urgently taken to restore healthy growth to the economy. Similar to&#13;
a medical operation which requires the patient to have the courage to face the pain, a plan&#13;
for appropriate treatment with his doctor, and preparation of available means for the&#13;
operation to be successful, the reform program equally needs a strong determination, a&#13;
clear action plan, an exact timetable with concrete targets, and resources to deal with&#13;
social issues emerging from and during the transition. The structural program needs to be&#13;
a inter-sectoral plan concentrating in three closely interrelated areas, namely trade&#13;
reforms, SOE reforms, and banking sector reform under the strong leadership of the&#13;
Government (Box 2).&#13;

                          Box 1: Patterns of Economic Development in Vietnam&#13;
&#13;
          The economic development process since 1986 can be classified into three&#13;
periods: 1986-1989; 1990-1995; and 1996-present, covering specific trends and&#13;
characteristics of policy measures to stabilize the economy and sustain growth.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 During this period, the economy was centrally planned and&#13;
highly inefficient, relying heavily on external assistance. It was characterized by low&#13;
growth rate, chronic and galloping hyperinflation, inefficient SOE performance,&#13;
substantial fiscal deficit, and high unemployment rates due to unsound economic&#13;
management and inappropriate policies.                                     The situation deteriorated further as Soviet&#13;
assistance ($1 billion per year) disappeared overnight while the American embargo&#13;
remained in place and there was no alternative assistance sources. The internal and&#13;
external economic imbalances had a negative impact on macroeconomic stability and the&#13;
people's living standards.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
          Box 1: Patterns of Economic Development in Vietnam (Continued)&#13;
&#13;
                              Facing with such challenges, Vietnam embarked on a Doi&#13;
moi program toward a market-oriented and open economy with a series of structural&#13;
reforms emphasizing four important issues. First, domestic trade and price liberalization,&#13;
including the devaluation of the foreign exchange rate and hyperinflation control&#13;
contributed toward a sound foundation for a market economy where signals for&#13;
production are market-determined prices, not government administrative interventions.&#13;
Second, freeing land's user-rights in rural areas, and changes in the production system&#13;
from cooperatives to households, encouraged farmers to improve their productivity and&#13;
production. Third, SOEs were granted autonomy and responsibility in production to&#13;
encourage more efficiency and better performance while easing the budget burden.&#13;
Finally, foreign trade was encouraged and legal provisions were made to attract foreign&#13;
direct investment, following the strategy of integrating Vietnam into regional and world&#13;
economies. As a result, annual average GDP growth rate was 8.1 percent; exports grew&#13;
at 29.1 percent on average and imports grew even faster at 37 percent; actual FDI&#13;
disbursements reached the highest record of 11 percent of GDP; inflation was brought&#13;
down from over 400 percent in 1986 to 5.3 percent in 1993.&#13;
&#13;
                             Since 1996, Vietnam has experienced signs of economic&#13;
slowdown. GDP growth rate slowed from the highest rate of 9.5 percent (1995) to an&#13;
estimated low rate of 4.7 percent (1999). FDI, as percentage of GDP, fell from the record&#13;
level of 11 percent in 1995 to 2.5 percent in 1998, and an estimate of 2.2 percent in 1999.&#13;
Exports growth rate was 28 percent in 1995 but slowed to an estimated 15 percent this&#13;
year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The 1997 regional financial crisis had a negative impact on the economy, with&#13;
decline in two major growth sources, namely exports and FDI. In 1998, exports to Asian&#13;
countries in financial crisis were nearly halted (at only 2.4 percent) due to their low&#13;
demand. Net 1998 FDI flows declined drastically by USD1 billion and if this trend&#13;
continues, Vietnam will lose USD3 billion for three consecutive years, or 10 percent of&#13;
GDP.&#13;
&#13;
      The situation worsens in 1999. Monthly inflation rate has been negative for the last&#13;
eight months. Farmer income fell due to a series of serious calamities. Substantial&#13;
imports contraction, due partly to investment declines and partly to current import&#13;
restrictions, resulted in a substantial plunge in foreign and domestic investments and&#13;
slowdown in industrial output. While exports have grown again in the past few months&#13;
as crude oil price improves, the recovery would take quite some time, with no U.S. trade&#13;
agreement. FDI has declined further to below USD1 billion. The economic recession is&#13;
reflected in the banking operations. For the first half of 1999, total bank deposit grew 29&#13;
percent while total outstanding loans increased by only 6 percent due to a drastic fall in&#13;
investment. This situation reflects the symptoms of the economic structural illogicality&#13;
addressed in the main text.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              Box 2. Objectives of the Second Wave of Structural Reforms&#13;
&#13;
1. Improve the economy's competitiveness by accelerating state sector reform to&#13;
   enhance SOE efficiency in the same competitive environment and market discipline&#13;
   as with other businesses, Create a favorable environment for the private sector to&#13;
   mobilize more resources for the development of a multi-sector economy;&#13;
&#13;
2. Phase out all trade protective barriers, especially non-tariff barriers, for a competitive&#13;
   environment in the domestic market and strategically integrate Vietnam's economy&#13;
   into the regional and world economies;&#13;
&#13;
3. Restore and maintain people's trust and confidence in the banking system to&#13;
   maximize the mobilization of and effectively allocate domestic resources for&#13;
   economic development by restructuring SOCBs and JSBs and separating policy&#13;
   lending from commercial banks.              Develop a healthy banking system within a&#13;
   prudential legal framework based on modern accounting and supervision system&#13;
   consistent with international financial standards;&#13;
&#13;
4. Strengthen economic policy management and implementation by creating a more&#13;
   favorable and market-oriented environment, allowing the market-determined price&#13;
   system to function while minimizing government interventions, and improving policy&#13;
   coordination among government agencies in policy making process.&#13;
