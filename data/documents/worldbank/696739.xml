ESTONIA&#13;
AGRICULTURE PROJECT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND'&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1           The Republic of Estonia lies on the Eastern shores of the Baltic Sea and shares borders&#13;
with Latvia and Russia. Estonia has a territory of 45,000 square kilometers, almost the size of the&#13;
Netherlands. About one third of its 1.5 million population live in rural areas.&#13;
1.2           Since regaining independence in August 1991, Estonia has followed an open and liberal&#13;
reform path. It has successfully stabilized its currency, and has liberalized all agricultural commodity&#13;
prices, while creating competitive markets based on minimal barriers of entry, and free internal and&#13;
external trade. After declining in 1992 and 1993, real output in Estonia began to recover in 1994 and an&#13;
annual growth of about 5% is projected for 1995 and 1996. The unemployment rate (adjusted for recorded&#13;
jobseekers), has decreased from between 8% to 9% in 1993 to around 6% in the fourth quarter of 1995.&#13;
After a sharp decline in 1992, real wages have increased broadly in line with productivity. Annual&#13;
inflation has continued to decline reaching 48% in 1994 and falling further to 29% in 1995.&#13;
1.3           The recovery of output is underpinned by sound economic policies. The stability of the&#13;
currency is being supported by monetary and fiscal policies consistent with the operations of the country's&#13;
currency board arrangement. External trade and payments policies are liberal, with no tariff or non-tariff&#13;
barriers. Sectoral policies are aimed at creating and supporting a viable private sector and the service&#13;
sector in particular has developed rapidly. Privatization of former state-owned enterprises and non-land&#13;
properties has nearly been completed. Urban and rural land properties are being restituted to their former&#13;
owners, however, this process has been slower than expected.&#13;
1.4           Estonian agriculture contributes to economic growth and provides low-priced agricultural&#13;
products for the mainly urban population. Furthermore, exports of agricultural, forestry and food products&#13;
contribute significantly to total export earnings, while budget allocations to agriculture amount to less than&#13;
5% of the state budget, which is quite small in international comparison. Estonian agricultural policy-&#13;
makers are committed to continuing their liberal agricultural policy and pursuing the goal of closer&#13;
cooperation and eventual membership in the European Union (EU).&#13;
1.5           Agricultural Policy. In the context of the country's liberal economic and trade policy,&#13;
agricultural strategy has aimed at creating an open competitive agricultural sector based on private&#13;
ownership of land, a private agro-processing sector, liberal agricultural trade, fully market-determined&#13;
agricultural prices, and minimal budget support for the agricultural and rural sector. Although proceeding&#13;
slowly and with difficulty, Estonia has continued to restitute rural land. The privatization of agro-&#13;
processing enterprises is nearly complete, and these companies are in the process of adapting to the market&#13;
economy. Since 1992, agricultural prices are completely market-determined. There are no import or&#13;
export tariffs regulating agricultural trade, and Estonia has entered into trade agreements with the EU and&#13;
the EFTA countries, and is moving toward accession in the WTO.&#13;
I      Summarized from Estonia: Agriculture and Forestry Sector Review ( Report # 13316-EE, May 16, 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                                      Chapter 1&#13;
1.6           Estonian agricultural policy to date can be described as exceptional within the former&#13;
Soviet Union (FSU) because price and market distortions have been almost completely avoided. The&#13;
single most important mechanism of Government support to the rural regions has been the establishment&#13;
of a fund with budget resources to provide loans for investments in agriculture and rural enterprises.&#13;
Commercial banks have used these resources to lend to agriculture and rural entrepreneurs at a capped&#13;
(and therefore subsidized) interest rate. Existing interest rate subsidies to the rural economy via this credit&#13;
fund2 are fully budget financed. Due to consistent and increasing pressure from the farmers' lobby to&#13;
support agriculture, the Government of Estonia (GOE) intends to continue to subsidize agriculture only&#13;
through the provision of credit funds from the budget with interest rate subsidies. In September 1995,&#13;
the Law on Regulating the Agricultural Market was passed by Parliament to replace the previous&#13;
Agricultural Market Law. The new law allows for price support payments to farmers and the imposition&#13;
of import tariffs on agricultural goods but does not actually determine tariffs. However, even though the&#13;
previous Agricultural Market Law allowed for price support payments to farmers, the GOE has not&#13;
regulated agricultural prices or trade in the past, and is committed to continue this open market policy in&#13;
the future.&#13;
1.7           Estonia is embarking on the next stage of improving rural institutions after having nearly&#13;
completed the transition to a market economy with minimal market distortions. Unlike other countries&#13;
of the former Soviet Union, the GOE has a well developed agricultural sector policy, and is now in a&#13;
position to effectively use public investments to rehabilitate rural infrastructure (including the deteriorating&#13;
farm drainage systems), promote the transfer to private ownership, improve agricultural technology&#13;
dissemination to the evolving private farms, promote rural entrepreneurship, and strengthen the sector's&#13;
public institutions.&#13;
B. Agriculture&#13;
1.8           Throughout its history, agriculture was the most significant activity of the Estonian&#13;
economy. Main export products were processed agricultural goods such as eggs, butter, cheese and flax,&#13;
and raw materials such as timber. The Soviet annexation in 1940 had a profound effect on the country's&#13;
economy through the elimination of private property, the collectivization of agriculture, and the&#13;
incorporation of Estonia into the Union-wide command system. Estonia was assigned the role of a&#13;
specialized livestock producer, and supplied dairy products, pork, and beef to neighboring republics, which&#13;
in turn, provided most of the grain and other needed inputs. Animal products accounted for more than two&#13;
thirds of the total value of agricultural production, and crop production was oriented mainly towards&#13;
roughage. The large agricultural trade surplus was based on heavily subsidized supplies of inputs and feed&#13;
from the other republics of the FSU.&#13;
1.9            Post-independence agriculture in Estonia is dominated by dairy and livestock production.&#13;
Even though livestock production has decreased considerably during the transition period, this sector&#13;
presents the highest competitive potential for Estonian agriculture. Crop production focuses on feed grains&#13;
and fodder crops for the livestock sector. In 1994 the sector accounted for about 9% of GDP, contributed&#13;
15% of exports, and employed about 6% of the Estonian labor force. It is estimated that agricultural&#13;
production decreased by about 40% from 1991 to 1993, resulting in a similar contraction of the&#13;
agricultural labor force. The food processing industry is characterized by over-capacities but, after&#13;
restructuring, is expected to contribute significantly to GDP.&#13;
2      The mission estimates the implicit annual rural credit subsidy to amount to US $1.0 million to date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                                       3&#13;
1.10           Exports. Although agricultural production has declined sharply, the export of agricultural&#13;
and food products has not declined to the same extent. Even though Estonia is a net exporter of meat and&#13;
dairy products, the trade surplus for these products has been declining, and future agricultural export&#13;
opportunities are not open-ended. Russia, the traditional customer, has imposed import tariffs on Estonian&#13;
agricultural products, yet agricultural exports to Russia continue to be of major importance, accounting&#13;
for 54% of total agricultural exports at the beginning of 1995. Other potential customers, such as the EU,&#13;
limit imports on the one hand through tariff barriers, and on the other hand, by their demand for high&#13;
quality and health standards for imported agricultural products.&#13;
.11          Food Demand. Consumption of meat and dairy products in Estonia has dropped since&#13;
independence from previously high levels. The cause is the decrease in real incomes of Estonian&#13;
consumers who have substituted relatively cheaper cereals and potatoes for the more expensive livestock&#13;
products. The combination of declines in local consumption of livestock products and increases in low&#13;
cost or better quality imports of agricultural and food products from neighboring countries, continues to&#13;
contribute to the contraction of the agricultural sector.&#13;
1.12           Farm Structure3. Before independence agricultural production was organized in 350 large&#13;
cooperatives, each managing some 3,500 ha with roughly 300 employees each. Nearly all of the assets&#13;
of state and collective farms have been privatized since independence. The farming structure has been&#13;
developing towards smaller sized family farms with an average size of 24 ha. Presently, the farm structure&#13;
is characterized by three different types of farms:&#13;
(a)    about 3,500 "legal enterprises" (joint stock companies, partnerships, and co-operatives)&#13;
which emerged from the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes (collective farms) now on about&#13;
70% of total agricultural land. The joint stock companies do not own land, the land either&#13;
belongs to the members, or is rented from the state. Often these enterprises have only a&#13;
transitional character and are dividing into smaller entities as the privatization process&#13;
continues and shareholders prefer to take their land and set up their own, private, farms.&#13;
Further contraction of these large-scale enterprises is expected over the next 18 to 24&#13;
months.&#13;
(b)    about 10.000 - 15,000 family farms with an average area of about 24 ha (17% of the total&#13;
agricultural lands). It is expected that the number of family farms will increase in the&#13;
near future (of these, only about 25% have registered their land titles).&#13;
(c)    more than 130,000 small, and non-registered, subsidiary plots, with an average area of 1.7&#13;
ha, often used by the shareholders of the large farming structures, to supplement their&#13;
wage income.&#13;
1.13           It can be expected that joint-stock farms will continue to down-size because members&#13;
wishing to start their own farms will withdraw their restituted land from the joint stock companies. The&#13;
number of private family farms will increase, and a larger share of rural income will be generated through&#13;
off-farm and non-farm activities as growth and employment opportunities in other sectors of the economy&#13;
increase. Some private farms will increase in size, whereas for others, land resource endowments will be&#13;
3      Information provided by the MOA. Due to the rapid transition of the farming sector, estimates of farm numbers and&#13;
land shares are changing rapidly, and do not necessarily correspond to other Government statistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                                Chapter I&#13;
inadequate for full-time farming and will need to be supplemented by off-farm income. Farm model&#13;
calculations (Annex 3) show that Estonian farms on good soils could compete internationally, especially&#13;
in dairy and beef production, if production efficiency was marginally increased (new techniques and&#13;
rehabilitated drainage), access to adequate credit was improved, input supplies and qualified extension&#13;
advice were secured, and quality and marketing of processed agricultural products was improved.&#13;
1.14         Livestock and Crop Production. Dairy production has traditionally been, and remains, the&#13;
major activity of the agricultural sector. However, it has also declined considerably since independence.&#13;
Beef meat production has declined even faster than dairy production due to its low profitability. Because&#13;
of climatic conditions, cereal production has never been of great importance and has continued to&#13;
decrease overall in the recent years. While the area planted with wheat and rye has increased slightly,&#13;
barley production, which is mainly used as animal feed, has decreased considerably.&#13;
1.15         As FSU markets have become less accessible and the supply of subsidized grain for animal&#13;
feeding has been withdrawn, herd owners have started to reduce production costs by placing more reliance&#13;
on pastures as a feed source. However, pastures have not been improved and managed in order to achieve&#13;
high yields and quality, and the milk yield per cow has dropped from an average of around 4,000 kg/year&#13;
to around 3,600 kg/year since independence. Only 23% of pastures contain legumes, and part of the&#13;
grasslands used for livestock feeding are in effect abandoned croplands containing a mix of volunteer&#13;
grasses and weeds. They will eventually reach the stage where they will no longer support livestock&#13;
production. Nevertheless low-cost technologies to increase milk and beef production and rehabilitate&#13;
pastures are available in Estonia and these are now being adopted successfully by a small number of&#13;
farmers.&#13;
1.16         Drainage. Historically, drainage has been a very significant element in maintaining the&#13;
productivity of both arable lands and those under forest cover. Drainage systems regulate the depth&#13;
(below surface) of the groundwater table and moisture of the soils during critical periods, thereby&#13;
lengthening the growing season and increasing crop and pasture yields. On areas where natural drainage&#13;
is inadequate, artificial drainage systems can extend the growing season for about a month by ensuring&#13;
that the groundwater table can be maintained at least 40 cm below surface. Well drained lands can be&#13;
planted earlier and harvested later, as waterlogging can be avoided and fields would be dry enough for&#13;
farm machinery to operate. Rehabilitation of drainage systems is an important prerequisite to increasing&#13;
crop and pasture production.&#13;
1.17         Of the 1.12 million ha of total arable land, some 739,000 ha or 66%  are drained&#13;
artificially. Routine maintenance of the drainage systems since independence has dropped dramatically&#13;
in most systems, due to constraints on the GOE's budget, to the point where permanent damage to the&#13;
system (e.g. plugging of tile drains) will be unavoidable in the near future unless proper operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) measures are revived. Much of the drain systems, particularly the sub-surface&#13;
systems covering 643,000 ha of the arable area, are now not functioning at full capacity. Additionally,&#13;
the drainage undertaken in the Soviet period was done without proper environmental assessment. Any&#13;
future investments in drainage rehabilitation will therefore need to undergo careful environmental&#13;
assessment.&#13;
1.18         Drainage is primarily the responsibility of the Land Amelioration Unit (LAU) of the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). LAU's twelve county-level Amelioration Bureaux (ABs) are presently&#13;
responsible for O&amp;M on all the drainage and polder schemes in their localities. A Land Amelioration Law&#13;
which regulates the organization of Land and Water Associations (LWAs) was adopted by the Estonian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                                  5&#13;
Parliament in April 1994.4 This law focuses on the privatization of drainage systems to individual fanmers&#13;
and on the establishment of LWAs. Membership in LWAs is compulsory for all farmers benefitting from&#13;
drainage systems. Following a transitional period, the LWAs are expected to take over the operation and&#13;
maintenance of their location-schemes from the county-ABs.&#13;
1.19          Repair and reconstruction of the drainage system was funded by the GOE with EEK 5.8&#13;
million in 1994, and in 1995 for EEK 10.3 million. A full national drainage rehabilitation program would&#13;
require massive budgetary resources, but the operational feasibility and economic justification of such a&#13;
massive program is questionable. Over 50% of the total areas of drained farmland have been classified&#13;
as lands of poor fertility. These areas, whether drainage is well maintained or not, do not have the crop&#13;
yield potential that would meet the thresholds for profitable farming under present cropping patterns and&#13;
open market economy input/output prices. Therefore, the Project would selectively finance drainage&#13;
rehabilitation only on the most fertile soils and would not finance any new drainage of agricultural lands&#13;
or forests.&#13;
1.20          Asriculture Extension Services. About 700 full and part-time agricultural advisors are&#13;
employed in the private sector (e.g. veterinarians, advisors from the processing industries, private&#13;
consultants, input suppliers); the public sector (e.g. staff from universities or colleges, research institutes,&#13;
county-based staff of the MOA); the media (mostly specialized press); and by the farmers themselves (e.g.&#13;
Farmers' Union with about 150 advisors, the Producers' Union, and farmers' circles). The present level&#13;
of public funding for extension is low, representing about 0.05% of the agricultural GDP whereas many&#13;
countries invest about I to 2% of agricultural GDP in extension. The MOA has decided to provide a large&#13;
part of the advisory services to the potentially more profitable farmers on a "for pay" basis, through a&#13;
private advisory system, while maintaining a small public advisory service to be available to farmers who&#13;
do not have the means to pay for advice. Rural information centers, which have been created in many&#13;
rural areas, assist with advice on off-farm job opportunities and rural entrepreneurship.&#13;
1.21          The extension service in the former Soviet Union was highly specialized and aimed at&#13;
servicing state and collective farms and ensuring the adherence to delivery of centrally planned production&#13;
targets. The advisors did not provide any business or market-related advice. The extension service now&#13;
requires retraining and re-orientation to provide advice relevant to an open market economy. The&#13;
emerging farmers lack business experience, and need advice on production techniques, agricultural&#13;
economics and farm management, while the managers of the profitable larger farms need advice on staff&#13;
management, marketing, and financial management. Several donor-financed technical assistanceprograms&#13;
have already been established in Estonia and are training agricultural advisors. In addition, EU (Phare),&#13;
as complementary support to this Project, has recently started a technical assistance program to train&#13;
agricultural advisors and to develop private agricultural advisory services.&#13;
1.22          Research. Research was highly centralized in the pre-independence period, but is now&#13;
being conducted at three levels. Universities undertake academic research, while applied research is the&#13;
responsibility of the Academy of Science and of the independent State research institutions and&#13;
laboratories. Research at all levels is severely constrained by a shortage of funds, and requires&#13;
reorientation to market-responsive production systems based on economic priorities.&#13;
4       Other laws reguating the finctions of LWAs include: Land Amelioration Law (1994); Law on Associations (1992);&#13;
Business Law (1995); and the Wiaer Law (1994).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                                  Chapter I&#13;
C. Agro-Enterpnses&#13;
1.23.        Aero-Processing. Most of the Estonian agro-processing (milk, meat, and grain enterprises)&#13;
have been privatized and sold, mainly to cooperatives, some of which have foreign investors. Small scale&#13;
activities have been successfully privatized, and several new enterprises have been established. Given the&#13;
high level of (nominal) overcapacity, technical deficiencies, and financial problems facing the large-scale&#13;
agro-processing enterprises, and the legacy of the export orientation to the FSU, significant&#13;
decommissioning of installed but out-of-date capacity, and upgrading of the remaining capacity, is required&#13;
to adequately transform these industries into efficient producers of the range and quality of products&#13;
acceptable in Estonia's future markets.&#13;
1.24         Food Ouality Control.  Present laboratories and their personnel are not equipped and&#13;
trained to meet international requirements in food quality control. The GOE plans to adjust quality control&#13;
measures and standards to meet EU food import standards, to enhance producers' export potential to the&#13;
EU and to other countries, and also to protect the health of domestic consumers. The trade agreement&#13;
between Estonia and the EU stipulates that Estonian agricultural exports must meet EU standards and that&#13;
the products be free of various contaminants and potentially harmful residues. Therefore, monitoring and&#13;
testing capacities need to be established to evaluate and ensure a high quality of food and livestock&#13;
products to exploit Estonia's export opportunities.&#13;
1.25         SuPDlY services have been improving since 1993 and agricultural input and machinery can&#13;
be purchased through dealers from the world market. Private farmers often depend on machinery services&#13;
from cooperatives, but their old Soviet machinery is outdated and will have to be replaced soon. New&#13;
arrangements, such as farmers' machine cooperatives, could provide the necessary services to small&#13;
farmers.&#13;
D. Land Reform&#13;
1.26         Land Reform. The total area of agricultural land and forest to be privatized is estimated&#13;
at 2.3 million hectares (including natural grass land, arable land, orchards, and forests) out of the total&#13;
Estonian land area of 4.5 million hectares. The reform of land ownership, (i.e., restoration of personal&#13;
property rights and the sale or lease of state lands) is a central element of Estonia's economic reform.&#13;
This also implies a reorganization of the collective farms. The Government recognizes that rural land&#13;
reform is the key element for rural economic transformation. The actual process of formally transferring&#13;
ownership to the newly established private farms has been slower than desirable. The approach chosen&#13;
for land reform - restitution based on pre-1940 boundaries - seems to be the most significant factor in&#13;
slowing down land privatization, and creating uncertainties as to the right of the cultivators. Many land&#13;
owners not involved in agriculture have chosen alternative lands or non-land compensation, in place of&#13;
accepting the restitution of their actual "ancestral lands." Consequently, a significant proportion of the&#13;
arable and forest land remains under State ownership at the end of the first stage of land restitution.&#13;
1.27         Despite the importance attached by the GOE to land reform and privatization, only 13%&#13;
of eligible rural lands (300,000 ha) have been devolved to private control (including restituted land, and&#13;
land transferred under the Farm Law Act of 1989). As of December 1995, about 220,000 ha (privately&#13;
and state-owned land) have been registered in the cadastre, and about 180,000 ha have been registered in&#13;
the Title Book. The slow progress of the land reform can be attributed to the difficulties in adjusting the&#13;
legal framework to handle high transaction volumes under restitution, insufficient institutional capacity&#13;
and lack of coordination between local cadastre centers (under the Land Board), title book offices (under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                                7&#13;
the Ministry of Justice), municipalities, notaries, and the GOE's limited financial resources to complete&#13;
the land surveys and registration.&#13;
1.28         After completing land restitution, market forces will govern the disposal, utilization, and&#13;
price of land. The land reform process has, however, created complex questions about the disposal of&#13;
state owned arable and productive land, and the establishment and facilitation of private land markets.&#13;
An important task for the GOE is to work out a policy for the transfer of ownership of state-owned lands&#13;
in the rural areas into private hands. Maintenance and management of parks and protected areas&#13;
established after 1940, which include former private agricultural lands, create further problems.&#13;
1.29         The GOE has initiated several actions to accelerate land reform and ownership transfers,&#13;
including: the devolution of land reform authority to municipalities; plans to simplify land registration&#13;
procedures; replacement of the Land Board management; the limiting of the Land Board's functions to&#13;
quality control over the municipalities and private surveyors' cadastre activities; and strengthening the&#13;
capacity of the land and title book registration offices to handle the large number of land and title&#13;
registrations. In 1995, the GOE has transferred state cadastre functions from the state agency Est-Survey&#13;
to the Land Board and plans to completely privatize Est-Survey's commercial land survey activities by&#13;
mid-1996. County Land Cadastre Offices have been established in nearly all counties. The GOE has also&#13;
recently established a Land Reform Commission consisting of representatives of the Ministries of Justice,&#13;
Agriculture, and Environment, the Land Board, and members of Parliament, to coordinate land policy,&#13;
develop suggestions to speed up the land registration process, and to simplify procedures and regulations.&#13;
Legislation approved by the Estonian Parliament in 1995 assigns up to 100% of the land tax to local&#13;
governments and gives local governments greater authority over land titling and registration.&#13;
Municipalities are now authorized to sell state owned land (without pending restitution claims) and can&#13;
retain some of the sales proceeds to accelerate their work. The GOE has allocated about EEK 73 million&#13;
(US $6.6 million) in the budget for 1996 to carry out land reform.&#13;
E. Rural Finance&#13;
1.30         The Estonian commercial banking system is inadequate,5 in relation to the size of the&#13;
economy, despite the relatively large number of independent banks. The Estonian banking system has been&#13;
privatized6 and, in the process, has gone through major restructuring and consolidation. Yet, there are still&#13;
too many banks for the overall economy, and further bank consolidation and restructuring is expected as&#13;
the Bank of Estonia continues to tighten its requirements.&#13;
1.31         The GOE has established a large number of funds to channel budget resources through&#13;
commercial banks to various sectors, including agriculture, rural enterprises, and housing. In 1993, the&#13;
GOE established three funds -- the Agriculture and Rural Life Credit Fund (ARLCF), the Small and&#13;
Medium Enterprise Fund, and the Export Credit Fund that finance credit to agriculture. The finances of&#13;
these funds are derived solely from the GOE's budget and loans from these funds are exclusively&#13;
channeled through commercial banks. Up to December 1994, about EEK 200 million had been on-lent&#13;
from ARLCF to commercial banks and then to farners and rural enterprises. The Government allocated&#13;
5      A more complete discussion can be found in the Financial Institutions Development Project (Report #6376-EE).&#13;
6      Even though the State remains a significant shareholder in a number of banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                                                 apter I&#13;
an additional EEK 91 million to ARLCF in 1995. Seventy-eight percent of the loans have been made for&#13;
agricultural activities, the majority directly for agricultural production. Up to 1995, the implicit annual&#13;
rural credit subsidy has been estimated by the appraisal mission to be about US $1.0 million.&#13;
1.32         The GOE plans to consolidate the large number of funds into one Regional Development&#13;
Fund and to allocate an additional EEK 100 million to this Fund in 1996. Although the GOE has not&#13;
fully developed the mechanism, it is anticipated that the funds would be on-lent to commercial banks and&#13;
then to farmers (about EEK 60 million). In addition, the Fund would finance interest rate subsidies (about&#13;
EEK 40 million) to cover the difference between commercial bank's market interest rates charged for&#13;
loans to agricultural producers and their interest rates charged to long-term borrowers in other sectors.&#13;
This would increase the rural credit subsidy planned for 1996 to US $4 million. The Government is fully&#13;
apprised of the impact of this subsidy, both on the budget and the banking system. However, it believes&#13;
such costs are acceptable relative to the negative economic impacts of the full protectionist support the&#13;
farming community would like to receive.&#13;
F. Environment&#13;
1.33         There is both a strong political commitment to, and a strong public awareness of,&#13;
environmental issues, including support for environment non-governmental organizations (NGOs) activity.&#13;
Estonia has inherited a number of serious environmental problems from the FSU, most of which relate&#13;
to pollution from heavy industry, ex-military sites, and urban waste disposal. Estonia has demonstrated&#13;
its commitment to the environment through its participation in multilateral efforts on the Baltic Sea, its&#13;
own and Bank-sponsored environment-related investments to support this amelioration effort,7 and ongoing&#13;
discussions with the Bank for additional environment-related investments. A draft overview of&#13;
environmental issues in Estonia is being prepared by the Bank. In addition, the Bank is assisting in the&#13;
preparation of a "Biodiversity Strategy" financed through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). Under&#13;
the District Heating Rehabilitation Project, the GOE took a significant step in reducing air pollution,&#13;
through its examination and adoption of alternative fuels and clean combustion methods.&#13;
1.34         Environmental legislation in Estonia exists and is being revised and augmented. The&#13;
current transitional status is characterized by a combination of the administrative procedures, legislation,&#13;
and standards used when Estonia was part of the Soviet Union, and some new provisions stipulated by&#13;
the GOE. Estonia's Basic Law on Nature and Environment Protection was passed in 1990. This has been&#13;
augmented by the recent passage of important laws and regulations regarding hazardous waste, solid waste,&#13;
environmental impact assessment (EIA), and natural resource pollution taxes.  The Ministry of&#13;
Environment (MOE) is responsible for review of EIAs when proposed projects are of national significance,&#13;
while County Environment Departments (CEDs) are responsible for the EIA of projects of local&#13;
significance. The MOE, with outside assistance, is working to improve the quality of ETA oversight.&#13;
Training is also being provided to specialists from line ministries, commercial banks and consulting firms,&#13;
in the preparation and use of ELAs in project design and implementation.&#13;
1.35         Pre-independence agriculture, primarily because of the concentration of large livestock&#13;
numbers in large farm complexes, caused localized (point-source), and in some cases significant, pollution&#13;
of soil and water resources. Drainage constructed during this period for expansion of agriculture and&#13;
7     For example, the Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project (Report #13907-EE, April 25, 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                                9&#13;
development of peat resources had a broad range of environmentally adverse impacts. Past over-use of&#13;
fertilizers and pesticides has also been reported. These problems can be avoided through the use of proper&#13;
environmental review procedures and adoption of mitigation actions. The decline in agricultural&#13;
production since independence, combined with the steep relative price increases of chemical inputs, has&#13;
reduced the previously high pollution loads. The decline in livestock populations, and their dispersal into&#13;
small units, has decreased the point-source pollution, but could result in more dispersed pollution if&#13;
livestock operations are not managed with adequate environmental safeguards (e.g. safe storage and limited&#13;
application of manure, etc.). Agricultural run-off, particularly to protected coastal areas and nature&#13;
reserves could cause environmental damages if mitigation measures are not enforced.&#13;
G. Bank Strategy and Experience in Estonia&#13;
1.36         Countrv Assistance Strategy. The key objective of the Bank's assistance strategy for&#13;
Estonia is to support development of a dynamic private sector, improve the existing public infrastructure,&#13;
and alleviate the pockets of poverty that have developed during the transition process, in order to raise&#13;
overall living standards. To achieve the objectives, the Bank's program is focused on two main areas:&#13;
(a) improving the environment for private sector investment and growth; (b) improving public&#13;
infrastructure services.&#13;
1.37         For agriculture, the Government has welcomed the Bank's support during the sector's&#13;
difficult transition to a market economy, which requires an agricultural sector based on private ownership&#13;
of rural land, enterprises, and farms, and competitive open markets, privatization of farm drainage&#13;
infrastructure, and effective public sector agencies to support private sector development in the rural areas.&#13;
The agricultural sector is of special importance to the Bank's strategy of supporting privatization in the&#13;
economy and specifically in the emerging rural private sector. This Project would support accelerating the&#13;
land reform, improving food quality control measures and standards to meet EU requirements, improving&#13;
rural human resource skills through public and private advisory services, upgrading and increasing&#13;
efficiency of farm drainage infrastructure and its privatization and transfer to the systems' beneficiary&#13;
groups.&#13;
1.38         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Experience. Previous Bank involvement in project&#13;
implementation has included a 1992 Rehabilitation Loan (US $30.0 million, completely disbursed and now&#13;
closed), a Highway Maintenance Loan for US $12 million in 1994, a District Heating Rehabilitation Loan&#13;
for US $38.4 million in 1994, a Health Project in 1995 for US $18 million, a Financial Institutions&#13;
Development Project in 1995 for US $10 million (all effective and under implementation), and the&#13;
recently approved Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project (April 25, 1995). Experience in&#13;
implementing these projects has shown that it is important in the initial stages of project implementation&#13;
to fully train the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) staff in project management, financial management,&#13;
and competitive procurement procedures. In general, implementation of projects in Estonia has been&#13;
satisfactory. Consequently, a joint PIU would be responsible to assist the implementation of the Bank's,&#13;
EU (Phare)'s and other donor programs in agriculture and the staff would be trained in management,&#13;
procurement, and monitoring &amp; evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                                               Chapter I&#13;
H. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.39           The Bank has assisted the GOE in the development of its sector strategy through the&#13;
preparation of this Project and the preparation and discussions of the Agriculture and Forestry Sector&#13;
Review. This review highlights key strategy elements for the development of the sector: efficiency&#13;
improvements in primary agricultural production; development of agricultural advisory services;&#13;
agricultural marketing improvements; and rapid completion of land reform. The Sector Review notes that&#13;
low wages, low land costs, and the existing stock of skills, equipment, and productive infrastructure&#13;
provide Estonia with a competitive potential in dairy and beef production. This competitiveness has&#13;
already been demonstrated on a limited scale by some transformed farms and food processing industries.&#13;
The Sector Review discussions with the GOE stressed the need for an open agricultural economy, land&#13;
privatization, and the reorientation and strengthening of public and private agricultural services. In&#13;
general, the GOE's agricultural policy reflects these objectives, although progress has been difficult in&#13;
some areas during the transition period.&#13;
1.40         Rural and Agricultural Strategy. The GOE actively supports the development of the rural&#13;
areas in order to narrow the income gap between urban and rural populations. The main objective of the&#13;
GOE is to transform and improve living conditions in the rural sector, primarily through accelerating rural&#13;
land reform and supporting agricultural and rural entrepreneurship activities. A key issue of this strategy&#13;
is the association and anticipated future membership of Estonia in the European Union. Developing an&#13;
agricultural policy aligned with the EU would therefore be central to the activities of the MOA in the&#13;
future, and the GOE is in the process of developing and refining its agricultural policies to reflect this.&#13;
1.41         The MOA has proposed to the Cabinet a set of polices and strategies. These strategies&#13;
includes the following key elements:&#13;
*   acceleration of the land reform by simplifying procedures for land registration, and by initiating&#13;
the sale or lease of land that has not been claimed by former owners and is under state control;&#13;
*   improved marketing of agricultural products through improved market transparency and by&#13;
adjusting quality control measures and standards to meet EU requirements;&#13;
*   improved rural financial services to provide farmers and rural entrepreneurs with long-term credit&#13;
funds coupled with advisory services for borrowers and banks;&#13;
*   revision of the tax policy to create equal tax conditions for agriculture;&#13;
*   development of an efficient agricultural advisory service to promote structural and technological&#13;
changes in agricultural production and land use; and&#13;
*   development and rehabilitation of rural infrastructure in areas with a low population density.&#13;
1.42         Bank Support. The Bank supports the MOA's strategy to ease key bottlenecks in the&#13;
agricultural sector, primarily by accelerating the land reform, improving the maintenance of rural&#13;
infrastructure (drainage), developing the agricultural advisory services, and improving the food quality&#13;
control. The Project would therefore strengthen the private sector, improve the MOA's policy and&#13;
regulatory functions, and support a gradual transfer of non-essential Government functions to the private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                               11&#13;
sector. The Project investments support key Government regulatory functions (food quality control,&#13;
environmental regulation in agriculture) and the gradual transfer of some government functions to the&#13;
private sector (land reform, drainage maintenance, advisory services). The Project assists the MOA in&#13;
rehabilitating and privatizing farm drainage infrastructure by handing over the responsibility for future&#13;
operation and maintenance to the beneficiaries. Furthermore, the Project supports the development of a&#13;
private farner-financed advisory service to complement a basic Government funded, modestly-sized,&#13;
agricultural extension service. These are investments of either a public good dimension, or necessary to&#13;
support the emerging private sector and reduce recurrent Govermment expenditures.&#13;
1.43         The Bank had intended to support the rural sector with investments in rural credit and&#13;
forestry. However the GOE, after consultations with the Bank, and for reasons discussed below, has&#13;
decided not to use loan funds from this Project for these priority areas.&#13;
1.44         The GOE plans to streamline support to agriculture and the rural areas through a Regional&#13;
Development Fund providing loan funds (for on-lending through commercial banks) and interest rate&#13;
subsidies for regional development, including agriculture. The GOE's policy is to continue to provide this&#13;
limited budget support to develop a viable private farming sector and to re-capitalize the emerging farms.&#13;
The Regional Development Fund (with interest rate subsidies) is seen by the GOE and the MOA as a&#13;
second best alternative, but it allows the Government to continue support for an open market policy in&#13;
agriculture. The Ministry of Finance judges that the distortion of the financial sector is small in&#13;
comparison to distortions that would be created by agricultural price support payments or an introduction&#13;
of significant agricultural import tariffs. Considering the high liquidity in the financial system and the&#13;
Government policy to subsidize interest rates, Bank lending for rural finance would not be appropriate at&#13;
this time.&#13;
1.45         For forestry sector investments, the GOE and the Bank have agreed during Project&#13;
preparation that the finalization of a Strategic Plan for Forestry (and related studies) should be a&#13;
prerequisite for determining future public expenditures in forestry. Assistance to the GOE for the&#13;
preparation of this plan, and the studies, is now being donor financed (see Annex 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin and Formulation&#13;
2.1            Estonia has followed a liberal reform  path: these reforms have successfully initiated&#13;
economic transformation. Whereas the liberal reform policy has been quite successful in the urban areas,&#13;
with wage incomes beginning to rise there, the reforms in rural areas have not shown similar levels of&#13;
success. This is mainly due to the slow progress of the land reform and the reorientation of agricultural&#13;
exports to western markets. The new Government is strongly committed to supporting development of&#13;
the rural areas and to narrowing the income gap between urban and rural populations.&#13;
2.2           The intent of the GOE and the Bank was to prepare a program of loan and grant supported&#13;
interventions (investments and technical assistance) to address agriculture and forestry productivity, rural&#13;
entrepreneurship and finance, rural infrastructure, rural land use management and related environment&#13;
issues, and land reform. During the course of project preparation by the GOE and the Bank, a number&#13;
of items were removed from the scope of the Project as they were either fully taken over by donor&#13;
supported technical assistance (forestry, rural entrepreneurship, rural finance -- Annex 1), or the GOE&#13;
decided not to borrow for investments (rural infrastructure other than drainage, and rural finance), but&#13;
instead to fund these from budget resources.&#13;
2.3           The Project supports the agricultural strategy through selected investments in farm&#13;
drainage rehabilitation, land use management, food quality control, and agricultural advisory services,&#13;
supported by the GOE's land reform budget. The components of this Project were designed by the MOA&#13;
and the MOE with bilateral', EU (Phare)2 and Bank3 assistance commencing October 1993. This report&#13;
reflects the outcome of the Bank's consultations with the GOE beginning with Project identification&#13;
(February 1994), followed by Project preparation missions (October 1994 and January 1995), appraisal&#13;
(June 1995) and included working groups to prepare the Project Implementation Plans (see Annexes -&#13;
Volume 2). Policy elements were extensively discussed with the GOE in a public review of the&#13;
Agriculture Sector Review in January 1995.&#13;
B. Project Objective&#13;
2.4           The Project objectives are to increase rural incomes and to stimulate the rural economy&#13;
through rural entrepreneurship. To achieve these objectives, the Project focuses on improving factor&#13;
productivity and competitiveness of agricultural products by providing assistance for the:&#13;
*    privatization of rural lands;&#13;
*    privatization and rehabilitation of select rural infrastructure;&#13;
*    improvement of human resources skills for entrepreneurship in rural areas;&#13;
Including Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK under bilateral assistance&#13;
programs, and through Consultant Trust Funds.&#13;
2      Complementary donor-funded TA is concentrated in forestry, rural private enterprise development, and the&#13;
development of sector information systems (Annex 1).&#13;
3      Including the Bank-FAO cooperative program.&#13;

*   introduction of new farming technologies consistent with transformed private agriculture; and&#13;
*   improvement in food quality.&#13;
2.5           The Project's objectives and strategies are consistent with the GOE's rural sector policies.&#13;
C. Detailed Project Description4&#13;
Land Reform (US $5.5 million)5&#13;
2.6           To accelerate the land reform, this component provides financing for the completion of&#13;
the National Geodetic Network; land survey works; and of a state rural land disposal study. Under&#13;
separate arrangements, donor-funded projects provide technical assistance to strengthen the institutional&#13;
and technical capacities of the Estonian National Land Board (ENLB), and land registration agencies.&#13;
2.7          National Geodetic Network. The Component would support the completion of a nation-&#13;
wide ground control network which coordinates all measured boundaries into one unified system. Over&#13;
a period of 3 years, 5,000 points would be measured by private surveying companies using GPS&#13;
technology.&#13;
2.8           Cadastral Surveying. This component would finance surveying and cadastre registration&#13;
of about 150,000 ha of rural lands over 5 years. This is equivalent to about 6,000 farmns of different sizes.&#13;
The surveys will be primarily carried out in the drainage rehabilitation areas financed under the Project&#13;
to complete the registration of agricultural land in the cadastre. The GOE would recover the costs of the&#13;
surveys from private land owners at a later stage. At negotiations, an agreement was reached that by June&#13;
30, 1996, the cadastre registration of Est-Survey (a state-owned surveying company) shall be transferred&#13;
to the National Land Board (para 5.1 (a)). As a condition of disbursement, the Borrower shall have:&#13;
published the tender for privatization of at least five of Est-Survey's regional land survey offices or&#13;
terminated Est-Survey's commercial land survey activities; and contracted all publicly-funded land and&#13;
property surveys to private surveyors under competitive bidding procedures (para 5.4 (a)).&#13;
2.9           State-Owned Rural Lands Disposal Policy. The Government would initiate studies to&#13;
analyze possibilities to lease and sell rural land under state ownership, to streamline land transfer&#13;
procedures, to clarify the rights and responsibilities of local governments, and to determine incentives for&#13;
title book registration. The study would also address the issue of future ownership of former private lands&#13;
which were designated and managed as "protected" areas during the Soviet period. By March 31, 1996,&#13;
the GOE would initiate studies, acceptable to the Bank; to formulate a national policy for the transfer of&#13;
State-owned rural andfarming lands to private ownership, and publish and present to the Bank a plan&#13;
for the development of such policy, including a timetable for its technical analysis and adoption, and, by&#13;
March 31, 1997, its implementation, taking into consideration the Bank's views (para 5.1 (b)).&#13;
Project Implementation Plans (PIPs) have been prepared for each major component, (see Annexes - Volume 2, PlPs).&#13;
Component costs, shown in parenthesis, are base costs.&#13;

2.10           Institutional Strengthening. The following ongoing, or future, donor-funded technical&#13;
assistance and training6, complements the Project objectives and the land reform:&#13;
*    land registry management;&#13;
*    land assessment methodologies;&#13;
*    land and real estate legal aspects;&#13;
*    survey training; and&#13;
*    training of cadastre specialists.&#13;
Farm Drainage Rehabilitation (US $10.9 million)&#13;
2.11           The drainage rehabilitation component would consist of: (a) rehabilitation of drainage&#13;
systems; (b) development of Land and Water Associations (LWAs); and (c) development of an adaptive&#13;
drainage research program.&#13;
2.12           Rehabilitation of drainage systems. The Project plans to rehabilitate about 60,000 ha of&#13;
drained agricultural land in about 60 separate locations. This component would rehabilitate main channels&#13;
and collector drains, flush and repair subsurface pipe outlets entering collector drains, and selectively till&#13;
compacted soils as a complement to site-specific drainage improvement.&#13;
2.13           Drainage Site Selection Criteria. Areas for drainage rehabilitation works would be selected&#13;
according to site selection criteria7 that include: (a) environmental screening; (b) soil fertility; (c) land use&#13;
intensity; (d) condition of the drainage systems; (e) technical feasibility and designs; (f) investment cost&#13;
ceiling; (g) status of land tenure;8 (h) farmer's participation, including formation of LWAs; (i) commitment&#13;
of LWA members to contribute to rehabilitation costs and take over future operation and maintenance of&#13;
the system; and (j) location of markets. Most (95%) of the state-owned agricultural land would be sold&#13;
or leased (minimum 10 year lease contracts) prior to commencement of the drainage rehabilitation works9.&#13;
Special screening criteria would be used for any proposed activities in the catchment area of the Matsalu&#13;
Bay because of the ecological importance of the Matsalu State Nature Reserve. Project financed drainage&#13;
investments would be limited to rehabilitation works and investments would not be made for new&#13;
drainage schemes and would not include polders'0 or "wet forests." Assurances have been sought at&#13;
negotiations from the GOE that investments in rehabilitation would be made only on those sites that fully&#13;
meet the above mentioned selection criteria (para 5. 1 (c)). At negotiations, an agreement was reached that&#13;
before commencement of the drainage rehabilitation works at any specific drainage site: the Borrower&#13;
would (a) register in the cadastre all lands at that specific drainage site to benefit from drainage&#13;
6      Not included in Project costs, but provided for in the Project description as background.&#13;
7      Selection criteria are elaborated in the Project Implementation Plan of the Drainage Rehabilitation Component (see PIP&#13;
#1) and are included in a supplemental letter. Drainage sites covering about 40,000 ha are currently under review&#13;
Compare discussion in PIP, para 8g.&#13;

Estonia Agriculture Project                                                                           15&#13;
rehabilitation; and (b) make available all such state-owned agricultural lands for purchase or lease (para&#13;
5. 1 (d)).&#13;
2.14            Design and Implementation. Drainage rehabilitation works would be divided into a design&#13;
phase and a construction phase. The design phase would be completed in 4 years (3,500 ha in 1995 pilot&#13;
sites):" 16,500 ha in 1996; 25,000 ha in 1997; and the remaining 15,000 ha in 1998). The construction&#13;
phase would take an estimated two years for each site after completion of the design. The rehabilitation&#13;
work design, establishment of the LWA, and physical works would be completed in three years for each&#13;
site. Within this time framework, the aggregate plan for the construction phase would be spread over a&#13;
period of five years with construction completed by the end of 2000."2&#13;
2.15            Develonment of Land and Water Associations. 3 The formation of LWAs is a recent legal&#13;
requirement for all beneficiaries of Government drainage investments. LWAs are being formed in all&#13;
drainage basins where such investments are planned. The Project would provide training and advisory&#13;
assistance to the MOA's drainage staff and to the members of LWAs on the legal, organizational and&#13;
financial functions of LWAs. It is expected that about 60 LWAs would be established in the proposed&#13;
project area. The GOE has allocated budget funds in 1995 to: (a) train the staff of the ABs; and (b) to&#13;
recruit and train local consultants to serve as facilitators in the context of the LWA development and to&#13;
assist in drafting agreements between the Government and LWAs on the scope of rehabilitation works and&#13;
farmers' contributions.&#13;
2.16            The MOA's Land Amelioration Unit (LAU)14 plans to commission three studies, namely:&#13;
(a) a series of social assessments of target drainage areas; (b) clarification of the future role of the ABs;&#13;
and (c) a mid-term review of the LWA development program. The social assessment of target sites would&#13;
begin in early 1996 and continue over a period of two years. A pilot social assessment for the proposed&#13;
sites in Vigala and Rannu is currently being carried out and would include specific consultation with&#13;
representatives of the Matsalu State Nature Reserve, and representatives for Lake Peipsi. Training and&#13;
technical assistance for local staff in social assessments and participation would be funded through bilateral&#13;
and World Bank resources (Fund for Innovative Approaches in Human and Social Development-FIAHS)&#13;
in 1995 and in 1996.&#13;
2.17            Drainage Research. The existing drainage research program of the Agricultural University&#13;
at Tartu (Institute of Water Management) would be reoriented to address: (a) reduction in drainage&#13;
operations and maintenance costs; and (b) the envirommental factors in drainage. The GOE would provide&#13;
equipment and field instruments to the Institute of Water Management, and funding for the existing staff&#13;
11     The Land Amelioration Unit (LAU) of the MOA has identified two pilot sites for detailed selection assessment and&#13;
environmental screening in 1995. These sites, Vigala (2,300 ha drained area) in Rapla county and Rannu (1,660 ha drained area)&#13;
in Tartu county were designed in 1995 using existing budget sources, followed by physical works in 1996 and 1997.&#13;
12     The Project would close in 2001, one year after completion of the drainage rehabilitation works, in order to&#13;
accommodate any unexpected delays.&#13;
13     Procedures for LWA formation and the internal organization and management of the LWAs are described in the&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (see Annexes - Volume 2, PIP #1).&#13;
14     The LAU is MOA's central unit responsible for planning and managing all drainage related activities of GOE&#13;
coordinating the activities of the 12 regional Amelioration Bureaux (AB).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                                       Chapter 11&#13;
of the Institute to conduct this research. This Project includes related funding to expand the scope of the&#13;
studies and to provide training.'" A parallel technical assistance program is currently being sought by the&#13;
Institute for possible international collaboration and exchange in this field.&#13;
2.18           Cost Recovery. The GOE plans to privatize the ownership, operations and maintenance&#13;
of all farm drainage systems by handing over these systems to LWAs after completion of the drainage&#13;
rehabilitation works. Responsibilities of LWAs are specified in the Amelioration Law (May 1994) and&#13;
membership is compulsory for farmers in the drainage area. The GOE has determined that each LWA&#13;
must agree to contribute (in cash or in kind) 20% of the cost of the rehabilitation works (the remaining&#13;
80% would be covered by the GOE with budget and Project loan funds). In return, the GOE would, post-&#13;
rehabilitation, no longer accept any further financial responsibility for these on-farm drainage systems.&#13;
The cost sharing formula is a legal decision of the GOE and based on an estimated average payment&#13;
capacity by the beneficiaries. The GOE decided to cover the majority of the one time rehabilitation costs&#13;
because thereafter each LWA would take-over full ownership of its area-specific drainage system and bear&#13;
the full future O&amp;M and rehabilitation costs.'6 However, the ABs would continue to be responsible for&#13;
operations and maintenance of rivers and main canals outside the drainage areas, as the main canals often&#13;
serve other users such as industries and municipalities. Cost recovery options for maintenance of rivers&#13;
and main canals are being considered, including the possibility of: (a) direct charges to landowners; and&#13;
(b) transferring the financial responsibility of this maintenance to the respective municipalities which&#13;
would then recover these costs through local taxes. At negotiations, an agreement was reached that the&#13;
members of the L WA benefiting from the Project's drainage rehabilitation shall contribute 20% of the&#13;
costs of the drainage rehabilitation works either in cash or by providing labor (para 5. 1 (e)).&#13;
2.19           Public Investment Program  for Related Rural Infrastructure. The GOE has allocated&#13;
significant sums in the Public Investment Program for 1995-1997 for rural infrastructure improvement.'7&#13;
The GOE would ensure that the necessary rural infrastructure upgrading, currently planned under the&#13;
Public Investment Program, would be provided at the locations of the participating LWAs as a&#13;
complement to their improved drainage systems.&#13;
Land Use Management (US $0.9 million)&#13;
2.20           Wetlands Management Strategy Study. The main objective of the study would be to&#13;
develop a national strategy for wetlands and to recommend a classification and identification system to&#13;
establish the value of wetlands. The study covers wetlands in forest and agriculture areas: drained lands&#13;
no longer cultivated, or to be abandoned to natural regrowth; peat-mined areas for restoration; and the&#13;
management of polders no longer under active operation. The study would be managed by the MOE and&#13;
Details in Annexes - Volume 2 - PIP #1.&#13;
16     The agreements between the LAU and the LWA to fund part of the rehabilitation costs and all future O&amp;M&#13;
expenditures are one of the site selection criteria without which rehabilitation works would not commence in that drainage site.&#13;
Before the beginning of the actual construction phase at each site, O&amp;M costs are covered by the GOE. During the actual&#13;
rehabilitation phase, O&amp;M and rehabilitation are undertaken simultaneously and no additional O&amp;M costs occur. After&#13;
completion of the construction work at each site, the LWAs will fully fund O&amp;M expenditures.&#13;
17     Including rural water supplies, rural roads, rural electrification, and nual telecommunications.&#13;

Estonia Agriculture Project                                                                   17&#13;
coordinated with the "Wetstonia" initiative of the World Wide Fund for Nature/Estonian Fund for Nature&#13;
and the actions to be supported under the Bank financed Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project.&#13;
2.21          Environmental Monitoring of Drainage Rehabilitation. The MOE is responsible for&#13;
monitoring all drainage rehabilitation works and developing appropriate environmental screening criteria&#13;
and procedures to ensure environmental standards of the works. The project would support the MOE by&#13;
financing laboratory equipment to analyze and monitor water samples from the proposed drainage sites,&#13;
and local consultants to conduct environmental screening of the proposed sites. As a condition for&#13;
effectiveness, the Borrower would promulgate official regulations regarding the environmental screening&#13;
criteria and procedures applicable to all drainage rehabilitation works in the borrower's territory; and&#13;
have published these regulations and procedures in the popular media (para 5.3 (a)).&#13;
2.22          Environmental Studies for Future Drainage Investments. The Project would support a&#13;
sectoral environmental drainage study to analyze future options for drained lands, and the measures needed&#13;
to convert drained lands from present use to other uses such as forest land, parks, wildlife protection areas&#13;
or wetlands. This study would be managed by the Water Department in the MOE.&#13;
Agricultural Advisory Services (US $6.0 million)&#13;
2.23          The Agricultural Advisory Services component consists of: (a) the establishment of the&#13;
Private Advisory Services Development Fund (PASDF); (b) strengthening the public extension services;&#13;
and (c) support to rural information centers. The MOA has created a National Agriculture Extension Task&#13;
Force and would appoint staff to formulate the future extension strategy of the MOA, the operation of the&#13;
PASDF, and the extension program for the publicly funded extension service. This task force membership&#13;
would be expanded to include representation of all stakeholders"8, and would be supported through&#13;
ongoing technical assistance financed by EU (Phare). In addition, the MOA, with EU (Phare) assistance,&#13;
will train and certify public and private agricultural advisors,"9 especially in economics and farm&#13;
management, extension methods, and new technologies.&#13;
2.24          The Private Advisory Services Development Fund (PASDF) would be established under&#13;
the Project to develop advisory services targeted at the most viable farms (presently about 2,500 family&#13;
and 1,200 joint stock farms).20 The PASDF would, on a demand basis, provide the farmers with an&#13;
annual grant to partially fund their contract with the agricultural advisors of their choice. Funding is&#13;
planned to serve about 2,800 farmers in 1996 expanding to about 5,000 by the end of the Project period,&#13;
equivalent to about 100 and 170 full time advisors respectively. The private advisors would be recruited&#13;
from the existing the MOA county-level staff and the other advisors already working in the sector. They&#13;
would provide advice on farm production, business skills including loan applications, marketing, farm&#13;
organization, and other areas. A farmer could apply for PASDF support from the county extension office,&#13;
select an advisor and sign a contract which includes terms of reference and payment details. The selected&#13;
is     This includes representatives of various farmers' groups, product-specific groups, advisors, research institutes,&#13;
universities, commercial suppliers of agricultural inputs, Ministry of Environment, the media, and environmental NGOs.&#13;
19     About 700 mostly part-time agricultural advisors are currently working in Estonia.&#13;
20     Family farm numbers are expected to expand during the Project period as the joint-stock farms downsize.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                                                Chapter II&#13;
private advisor would visit and advise the farmer regularly. The county extension offices would be&#13;
responsible for determining the number of farms eligible for PASDF support,2" informing farmers and&#13;
advisors, and supervising payment of the contracts. A farmer would be entitled to receive a PASDF grant&#13;
of not more than EEK 2,000 in the first year to contract private advisory services. The farmer would be&#13;
required to pay at least 10% of the contract value in the first year (with an increasing share in the&#13;
subsequent years -- Table 2.1) and any fees agreed with the advisor above the EEK 2,000 upper limit.&#13;
It is estimated the farmers' entitlement would cover a comprehensive business plan and ten to twenty farm&#13;
visits. The MOA is receiving assistance from EU (Phare) to establish the operating policies of the&#13;
PASDF. At negotiations, agreement was reached that, by May 31, 1996, the Borrower would establish&#13;
the PASDF and appoint a manager of the PASDF under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
(para 5.16)).&#13;

Estonia Agriculture Project                                                           19&#13;
2.25         The publicly funded extension service would be strengthened through donor funded&#13;
training and technical assistance to develop educational programs on improved agricultural practices&#13;
adapted to the transformed farms. This support is mainly directed at the 150 agricultural extension agents&#13;
employed by the Farmers' Union (salaries paid by the GOE) who target their services to the middle&#13;
category of farms (about 10,000 family farms and 1,000 joint stock farms). The Project also supports the&#13;
development of training materials for the extension programs (both public and private).&#13;
2.26         Rural Information Centers would be strengthened with equipment from the Project and&#13;
donor-funded technical assistanceto assistthe rural population in finding alternative off-farm employment.&#13;
About 5 rural information centers have already been established, financed by the GOE and managed by&#13;
the Ministry of Economy. The Rural Information Centers target those farmers (estimated 5,000 family&#13;
farms and 1,500 joint stock farms) that may need to supplement their income through non-farming&#13;
activities, or even leave farming altogether.&#13;
Food Quality Control and Veterinary Laboratory (US $1.7 million).&#13;
2.27         The Project would strengthen the National Veterinary Control Laboratory through: (a)&#13;
acquiring laboratory equipment for the National Veterinary Control Laboratory to improve monitoring and&#13;
testing of contaminants and harmful residues in agricultural food products of animal origin and to improve&#13;
the testing capacities for infectious animal diseases; and (b) training staff, technicians, and scientists of&#13;
the National Veterinary Control Laboratory in the operations and maintenance of the newly acquired&#13;
equipment. Both interventions are necessary for Estonia's agricultural products to meet EU food quality&#13;
certification requirements. This component would be complemented by donor-funded projects to provide&#13;
technical assistance and training for the development of food legislation, institutional strengthening,&#13;
establishment and operations of modem food quality control facilities, both within the agro-processing&#13;
industries, and as commercial services to them.&#13;
Project Management (US $0.9 million).&#13;
2.28         A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would be established to serve all components of the&#13;
Project in planning and management, procurement, accounting, reporting, monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
general administration, and overall coordination among the line implementing agencies (Chapter 3).&#13;
Project funds would support the hiring of consultants and local contract staff. The PIU would assist both&#13;
the Agriculture Project and the EU (Phare) Agricultural Assistance Program in implementing these&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;

D. Project Costs22&#13;
2.29             The total cost of the Project is estimated at US $30.9 million, including contingencies, of&#13;
which the foreign exchange cost is estimated at US $17.6 million or 58% of the total cost. Total base&#13;
costs of the Project amount to US $25.9 million, of which recurrent costs are US $4.9 million (excluding&#13;
contingencies). The total Project cost include US $4 million in price23 and US $1 million in physical&#13;
contingencies. Physical contingencies have been estimated by adding 5% to the base costs of most&#13;
investment expenditure items, with the exception of the PASDF. Physical contingencies are not applied&#13;
to this item, because it represents a projected expenditure allocation ceiling. A summary of Project costs&#13;
by component is presented in Table 2.2.&#13;

E. Financing&#13;
2.30             The proposed financing of the Project (including contingencies), is indicated in Table 2.3.&#13;
Several expenditure accounts are set up to facilitate the accounting and monitoring of different types of&#13;
expenditure items. Although several of these expenditure accounts include the same type of resources&#13;
(namely consultants for Studies and Designs, Technical Assistance, Professional Services, and Training),&#13;
they are kept under separate accounts to facilitate Project management by the implementing agencies.&#13;
22      Detailed project costs by components are presented in Annex 6.&#13;
23      Local inflation rates are projected at 30% in 1995; 20% in 1996, 15% in 1997; 12% in 1998; 10% in 1999; and 10%&#13;
in year 2000. Foreign inflation rates are projected at 6.90/o in 1995; 2.0% in 1996; 1.6% in 1997; 2.1% in 1998; 2.4% in 1999;&#13;
and 2.2% in 2000, based on the Bank's G-5 MIUV index of May 1995.&#13;

2.31             The GOE is eligible for single currency loans under the expanded SCL program  for 100%&#13;
of its anticipated FY96 lending program of US $15.3 million equivalent. The Borrower informed the&#13;
Bank during negotiations that it wishes to borrow in a single currency (DEM) at a variable LIBOR-based&#13;
interest rate for the proposed Project. The Estonian delegation justified the choice of a single currency&#13;
loan by stating that most of Estonian's loans are LIBOR-based to ensure that the country does not pay&#13;
higher than market rates at any point in time. Estonian's currency is pegged to the Deutsche Mark.&#13;
2.32             Parallel grant financing has been received from  EU  (Phare) for technical assistance for&#13;
the development of the agricultural advisory services. In addition donors2" have expressed their interest&#13;
in providing technical assistance to support the Project. The GOE would inform all committed and&#13;
prospective donors that the Bank would be consulted on all terms of reference for technical assistance&#13;
supporting the Project. At negotiations, an agreement was reached that the Borrower would consult the&#13;
Bank on all Terms of Reference for technical assistance services supporting the Project, irrespective of&#13;
24     AAmong the countries which have expressed a specific interest in providing technical assistance to support the Project are&#13;
the Governments of Austria, Denmark, Germany, France, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.&#13;

2.33         The GOE would finance all incremental recurrent costs (e.g., operations and maintenance&#13;
of equipment, office administration, and maintenance of adequate local staff) within Project-relevant&#13;
Government institutions. Once rehabilitated, the drainage systems would be handed over to the LWAs&#13;
to be operated and maintained entirely by these associations.&#13;
F. Procuremene5&#13;
2.34         At negotiations agreement was reached that all procurement would be carried out in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January,&#13;
1995), and Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency (August, 1981) (para 5.1 (h)) Table 2.4 summarizes the procurement amounts and&#13;
methods.&#13;
2.35         The GOE recognizes the importance of establishing public procurement regulations as part&#13;
of its transition to a competitive market economy. The Bank has been assisting with this since February&#13;
1994. Estonia's Law on Public Procurement was approved by the Council of Ministers in May 1995 and&#13;
was passed by the Parliament in the fall of 1995. The recently completed procurement strategy paper&#13;
recommended a central Procurement Advisory Service (PAS) in the Ministry of Economy, which has been&#13;
established with assistance from the Finnish Government. A "General Procurement Notice" containing&#13;
information about bidding opportunities has been prepared and it will be published in the "Development&#13;
Business" in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.&#13;
2.36         Procurement Management and Training. Procurement would be the responsibility of the&#13;
implementing Ministries, supported by the PIU. The PIU would hire a full-time procurement specialist&#13;
with qualifications approved by the Bank, who would be assisted by an international procurement&#13;
consultant. In addition, the Ministries would be assisted by the newly established PASDF. Relevant&#13;
personnel from the MOA, the MOE, and MOF have participated, and would participate in procurement&#13;
training courses organized by the Bank. The efficiency and capability of the Borrower to carry out the&#13;
Bank's procurement procedures would be strengthened through the services to be provided by PASDF,&#13;
training, and the use of Standard Bidding Documents. A project launch workshop (training in&#13;
procurement, disbursement, accounting and reporting requirements) is scheduled prior to project&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
2.37          Civil Works (US $7.9 million). All civil works would be procured through National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB). NCB items for civil works are for drainage rehabilitation and maintenance.&#13;
The number of contracts is expected to be about 60. NCB is appropriate given that: (a) the average&#13;
values of works per site are small (less than US $150,000 and would not exceed $300,000); (b) locations&#13;
are scattered geographically (and thus not permitting "packaging" of a number of site contracts) and cover&#13;
non-contiguous drainage systems of 100 to 150 hectares in size; (c) implementation requires continuous&#13;
participation and contributions from local farmers; (d) ownership of the drainage rehabilitation is linked&#13;
with intensive participatory preparation of establishing Land and Water Associations; and (e) small&#13;
contracts to local contractors reduce mobilization and organization costs. Domestic bidders would not&#13;

that there would be two ICB packages. The Borrower would use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
for Goods. International Shopping (aS), based on comparison of price quotations obtained from at least&#13;
three suppliers from two eligible countries, will be used for procurement of small specialized laboratory&#13;
equipment and demonstration materials estimated to cost less than US$100,000, with an aggregate limit&#13;
of US$150,000. National Shopping (NS), based on comparison of price quotations obtained from at least&#13;
three eligible suppliers, will be used for procurement of office equipment and fumiture estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$50,000, with an aggregate limit of US$150,000.&#13;
2.39         Technical Services (US$ 6.7 million). This would consist of surveying contracts for&#13;
individual packages at an estimated cost of US$ 250,000 each, through NCB procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, and following a prequalification of prospective contractors. At negotiations, the Borrower agreed&#13;
on the principles for standardized bidding documents for technical services. As a Condition for Board&#13;
presentation, the bidding documents and the pre-qualification criteriafor the technical services (rural land&#13;
surveys) would be submitted to the Bankfor review (para 5.2 (a)).&#13;
2.40         Consultant Services are divided into several categories:&#13;
(a)  Studies (US $0.8 million). The Project would finance studies on land use management and for&#13;
agricultural advisory services.&#13;
(b)  Design (US $1.2 million). The Project would introduce standardized contracts for engineering&#13;
design and civil works supervision for drainage rehabilitation works. Each Amelioration Bureau&#13;
(AB) would select a consulting company, through a competitive process, to provide all engineering&#13;
design and civil works supervision for all drainage rehabilitation sites within the responsibility of&#13;
the AB. The contracts would be grouped into packages of approximately US $50,000 each and&#13;
administered by the 12 ABs.&#13;
(c) Agricultural Advisory Services (US $4.4 million). The Bank would partly finance the&#13;
employment of consultants (local and possibly some foreign experts) in connection with the&#13;
provision of private advisory services for priority programs on agricultural extension. The&#13;
beneficiaries of the agricultural advisory services would directly procure their own private advisors&#13;
using a standardized contract acceptable to the Bank. Given the large number of private advisors26&#13;
and the objective of the Project to develop a competitive private advisory services, a large number&#13;
of individual contracts would be submitted for reimbursement. The MOA would self-finance 20%&#13;
of payments made by the PASDF for agricultural advisory services. As a condition for&#13;
disbursement, the Borrower would present to the Bank a standardized contract format for&#13;
agricultural advisors' services, and the selection criteria for agricultural advisors to be eligible&#13;
under PASDF, both satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.4(b)).&#13;
(d) Training (US $0.4 million). Consultants would be contracted for training related to food quality&#13;
control; development of LWAs; and skill development training in extension.&#13;
2.41         Procurement Review. All ICB procurement packages above US $300,000, and the first&#13;
two civil works and two technical services contracts in each year would be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review and approval. For consulting services, prior review is required for all contracts with individuals&#13;
exceeding US $50,000; all contracts with consulting firns exceeding US $100,000; and terms of reference&#13;
for all consultant services irrespective of the contract value. Other procurement would be subject to the&#13;
26    Initially about 100, then rising to 170 over Project lifetime.&#13;

Guidelines.&#13;
2.42            Procurement Plan and Monitoring. Procurement plans for major procurement packages are&#13;
presented in the respective Project Implementation Plans (attached). Procurement data would be collected&#13;
and recorded by the PIU and by the PASDF. At negotiations it was agreed that the Borrower would&#13;
prepare quarterly progress reports on the procurement of goods and services under the Project (para 5.1&#13;
(i)).&#13;
G. Disbursements&#13;
2.43           The allocation of loan proceeds to various disbursement categories is shown in Table 2.5.&#13;
2.44            Disbursements would be made against standard Bank documentation. The PIU would&#13;
retain all documentation to support Bank-financed expenditures for review by Bank supervision missions&#13;
and verification by external audits. The minimum size of applications for direct payment from the loan&#13;
account or issuance of the special commitment should amount to not less than 20% of the deposit to the&#13;
Special Account (SA). Applications for withdrawals of loan funds would be fully documented, except&#13;
for expenditures under individual contracts not exceeding US $300,000 for goods and equipment,&#13;
US $300,000 for civil works, US $50,000 for consultant services from individuals, and US $100,000 for&#13;
consultant services by consultant firms, funded from  the Special Account on a quarterly basis.&#13;
Expenditures under these contract ceilings would be disbursed against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs)&#13;
certified by the implementing Ministry.&#13;

2.45          To facilitate Project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account (SA)&#13;
in one of the major commercial banks on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The authorized&#13;
allocation of the Special Account would be US $1,000,000, representing about 4 months of average&#13;
expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stages of the project, the initial&#13;
allocation to the Special Account would be limited to US $500,000 (subject to revision at negotiations)&#13;
until the aggregate disbursements under the loan shall be equal or exceed the equivalent of US $3,000,000.&#13;
2.46          Applications for replenishment of the SA would be submitted monthly to the Bank by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.&#13;
Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure, as described&#13;
in the Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the SA which have been&#13;
reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests. At negotiations, the terms and&#13;
conditions for the establishment and operation of the Special Account were agreed (para 5.1 6)).&#13;
2.47          The Bank loan is expected to be disbursed over five years beginning in the third quarter&#13;
of 1996. A disbursement schedule is summarized in Table 2.6.&#13;

H. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.48          The proposed project has been reviewed consistent with the requirements of Estonian&#13;
Governmental Regulation No. 314 of November, 1992, concerning "Environmental Impact Assessment"&#13;
and the provisions of the Bank's Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment. " A review of&#13;
environmental aspects of the proposed project was prepared with the participation of the MOE, which&#13;
confirms that all components correspond to Estonian environmental regulations, and this is provided as&#13;
Annex 4. The farm drainage rehabilitation component has been placed in screening category "B" and&#13;
activities to be supported under this component would be subject to environmental screening and review&#13;
consistent with procedures jointly developed by the MOE and the Bank. Annex 4 describes the potential&#13;
impacts associated with these components, provides environmental screening procedures for sub-activities,&#13;
recommends mitigation measures to minimize these impacts, and reviews proposed monitoring actions.&#13;
All other project components have been placed in screening category "C."&#13;
2.49          The Wetlands Management Strategy Study has been classified as being of State importance&#13;
by the MOE because it addresses key environmental issues in Estonia. The MOE plans to have the&#13;
preparation of the Wetlands Management Strategy Study include the preparation of an environmental&#13;
impact assessment consistent with Estonian procedures to allow for upstream consideration of&#13;
environmental issues in this strategy and to provide an effective means for public participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                          27&#13;
2.50         Environmental studies for future domestically financed options in drainage investments&#13;
would be conducted to ensure that investment project designs are environmentally sensitive and to improve&#13;
the sustainability of drainage infrastructure and promote environmental protection. A framework for&#13;
environmentally sustainable management of wetlands would be established through the Wetlands&#13;
Management Strategy Study. Overall, the Project has been designed to integrate environmental controls&#13;
and seek public input on environmental concerns. A number of NGOs (Estonia Fund for Nature,&#13;
Stockholm Environment Institute-Tallinn) have been consulted during the project preparation process,&#13;
especially regarding the drainage rehabilitation component. Representatives of the Matsalu State Nature&#13;
Reserve have been consulted on the design of environmental screening criteria for drainage rehabilitation&#13;
in the catchment area of the reserve, given the ecological importance of this area.&#13;
I. Poverty Impact&#13;
2.51         Since independence, Estonia has moved rapidly towards a market economy. During the&#13;
transition period, the living standard for segments of the population have declined as the costs of living&#13;
have increased faster than average wages. The transition period has been especially severe on the rural&#13;
population and the rural population is among those with the highest probability of becoming poor. Since&#13;
the situation in Estonia is changing rapidly, only limited and piecemeal information is available on rural&#13;
poverty. Project beneficiaries (the rural population), have a significantly larger proportion of poor people&#13;
than the population as a whole. However, the current restructuring of agriculture has had a negative&#13;
impact for some segments of the rural population.&#13;
2.52         The following differential impacts may be seen:&#13;
(a) Rural Unemployment. Employment in the agriculture sector has declined from around 100,000&#13;
to about 30,000 from 1991 to 1994 but this decline seems to have lessened. Some of the&#13;
redundant farm laborers might have found jobs in the expanding service sector, but many have&#13;
to depend on seasonal or part-time employment, and on the products of their household plots until&#13;
the rural job market improves. The Project actively pursues the creation of rural jobs and off-farm&#13;
employment through it's various components.&#13;
(b) Farmers in areas with good agricultural potential would benefit as the project components&#13;
specifically support the development of economically viable farms. However, it is expected that&#13;
farmers in marginal areas would not benefit from the on-farm investments in drainage&#13;
rehabilitation but would have access to the rural advisory services to identify potential alternative&#13;
off-farm income sources.&#13;
(c) Urban and Rural Consumers would benefit from the project as food products continue to be&#13;
produced at or below world market prices, on efficient and unsubsidized farms. Lower food prices&#13;
would directly benefit the poorer segments of the population.&#13;
2.53         The Project would support policies that deliberately target the viable agricultural sector&#13;
and might therefore negatively affect a number of farm workers. However, the support to the rural&#13;
economy would increase off-farm employment and rural job opportunities. Furthermore, the benefits of&#13;
the reform policy accruing to the majority of the rural and the urban population clearly outweigh the short-&#13;
term costs. In the long run, the reform policies of the GOE supported by the Agriculture Project would&#13;
create a competitive and productive rural sector that provides jobs and improves incomes for the rural&#13;
population, and is not dependent on income transfers from taxpayers or consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                              Chapter I&#13;
J. Gender and Family Issues&#13;
2.54         The need for a specific loan component to address gender issues was evaluated during&#13;
project preparation and not seen as necessary. Men and women in Estonia have equal rights to land&#13;
ownership. Women share responsibility in the rural sector in Estonia, including, for example, management&#13;
responsibilities in large farm organizations, and political leadership for rural municipalities. The breakup&#13;
of large collective farms is expected to create more family operated farms and businesses. The social&#13;
network of many of the former collective farming structures, such as child care and community activities&#13;
has been partly taken over by the municipalities. Downsizing of the agricultural sector may result in a lack&#13;
of employment opportunities for the younger and the older generation -in the rural areas. The Government&#13;
therefore plans to target support (outside of the Project) directly to these groups in the rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
M. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
3.1          Proiect Steering Committee. Overall Project coordination would be handled by a Project&#13;
Steering Committee (PSC) consisting of: (a) key members from the Ministries of Agriculture, Environment&#13;
and Finance; and (b) associate members from at least the Ministries of Justice, the Farmers' Union, and&#13;
the Producers' Union, the Food Board, a representative of the municipalities concerned, and two Joint&#13;
Project Directors from the MOA and the MOE. The key members of the PSC would meet on a monthly&#13;
basis and, with the associate members, every three months. The PSC would be maintained until&#13;
completion of the Project. The GOE has designated two Joint Proiect Directors one each from the MOA&#13;
and the MOE at Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor level, to supervise Project implementation. Day-to-day&#13;
implementation responsibility would be assigned to the Project Manager and the Project Coordinator from&#13;
the MOE. Draft terms of reference for PSC, and its membership, are provided in Annex 5.&#13;
3.2          A centralized Proiect Implementation Unit (PIU) would be established within the MOA,&#13;
headed by a Project Manager and reporting directly to the Joint Project Directors. The major task of the&#13;
PIU is to assist the line agencies of the MOA and the MOE in implementing the Agriculture Project and&#13;
administering EU (Phare)'s assistance program for agriculture. The PIU would be responsible for: (a)&#13;
coordination of, and support to, line implementing agencies; (b) administration, accounting, and financial&#13;
management; (c) procurement coordination and supervision; (d) loan disbursement; (e) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; and (f) reporting. The PIU would consist of a Project Manager, EU (Phare) program&#13;
coordinator, procurement specialist, advisory services and monitoring &amp; extension specialist, accountant,&#13;
two secretaries and drivers. Draft terms of reference for the PIU, its local staff and consultants are&#13;
provided in Annex 5. The PIU would assist both the Agriculture Project and EU (Phare)'s agricultural&#13;
assistance program in procurement, disbursement, monitoring &amp; evaluation, project administration and&#13;
supervision of Project implementation. This joint PIU, which effectively continues and widens the tasks&#13;
of the currently operating EU (Phare) PIU, would be established in early 1996 and financed by EU&#13;
(Phare). The MOA, EU (Phare) and the Bank are presently negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding&#13;
on the funding and supervision of the PIU, to support the Bank's, EU (Phare)'s and other donors'&#13;
programs. The joint PIU would operate prior to effectiveness.&#13;
3.3          The MOA and the MOE would implement the individual components through the normal&#13;
day-to-day functioning of their responsible line agencies under the overall supervision of the Project&#13;
Manager and the MOE Project Coordinator and with administrative assistance from the PIU. The&#13;
implementing agencies would be responsible for procurement and would receive assistance from the PIU&#13;
and the Procurement Advisory Service established in the Ministry of Economy to provide general&#13;
assistance in procurement. During Project preparation, the existing EU (Phare) PIU has supported the&#13;
preparation activities and will continue to assist the implementing line agencies until the joint Bank - EU&#13;
(Phare) PIU is in place. Currently, the implementing line agencies are receiving assistance from the EU&#13;
(Phare) PIU, consultants, and from the Bank's resident office in Tallinn, for Project preparation.&#13;
3.4          Coordination of all donor-funded technical assistance is under each of these Ministries'&#13;
Foreign Relations Department. The Bank would exercise general oversight of the donor-funded technical&#13;
assistance complementary to the Project, with prior agreement from the donors and the GOE, and in the&#13;
context of the Bank's normal supervision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                                                 Chapter III&#13;
3.5           As conditions for loan effectiveness, the Borrower will have appointed.&#13;
(i)    the Chairman and members of the Project Steering Committee;&#13;
(ii)   the Project Manager of the PIU; and&#13;
(iii)  the staff of the PIU, including the specialized technical stafffor procurement,&#13;
accounting, Project management, and monitoring &amp; evaluation with qualifications&#13;
and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. (para. 5.3 (b)).&#13;
3.6           As a condition of effectiveness, the Borrower will have made adequate allocations for the&#13;
Project in the budget for the year 1996 (para. 5.3(c)). The Borrower would include adequate annual&#13;
operating costs for the proper functioning of the Project administration in the subsequent budget&#13;
allocations for the MOA and the MOE. This would be agreed in a supplemental letter to the loan&#13;
agreement.&#13;
B. Line Implementing Agencies'&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
3.7           The MOA, through the PIU, would provide Project coordination and administration&#13;
functions for its Project components.&#13;
3.8           The Land Amelioration Unit (LAU) and its regional offices -- Amelioration Bureaux&#13;
(ABs) -- would be responsible for the implementation of the drainage rehabilitation component. The&#13;
LAU, located in the MOA, is responsible for the supervision of the ABs. The LAU would also oversee&#13;
site selection and design of drainage rehabilitation, coordinate environmental site screening with the MOE,&#13;
and provide technical support for regional efforts to establish LWAs. The LAU would coordinate: (a)&#13;
consulting services from local institutions, and from donor-sponsored technical assistance,2 for training for&#13;
LAU staff in social assessment and participatory techniques for LWA formation; and (b) the drainage&#13;
research sub-component with The Institute of Water Management of the Agriculture University of Tartu.&#13;
The LAU would also be responsible for coordination with the MOE on issues of environmental impact&#13;
assessment of each drainage site.&#13;
3.9           The National Agricultural Extension Task Force (NAETF),3 with wide stakeholder&#13;
participation, would formulate and periodically monitor and modify the operations of the PASDF and the&#13;
future extension strategy for the MOA. The MOA and its county-level extension offices are responsible&#13;
for administering the PASDF. As a condition of effectiveness, the MOA would have, to the satisfaction&#13;
of the Bank; expanded the participation in the NAETF to fully reflect the wide diversity of stakeholder&#13;
interests; the stakeholders 'representatives would have been appointed by their constituent groups; and&#13;
the MOA would have provided the NAETF with a secretariat consisting of a manager, staff an operating&#13;
budget, and terms of reference (para 5.3(d)).&#13;
I     Detailed component implementation agreements are included in each of the component PIPs (see Annexes - Volume 2).&#13;
2      Including activities funded from the Bank's Fund for Innovative Approaches in Human and Social Development (FIAHS).&#13;
3      The organization for the NAETF and overall management of the advisory services component are described in Volume&#13;
2, PIP #2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                                           31&#13;
3.10           The State Veterinary  DeRartment  under the MOA, would be responsible for the&#13;
development of the food quality control and the veterinary laboratory sub-component. The laboratory&#13;
equipment would be delivered and managed by the National Veterinary Control Laboratories which report&#13;
directly to the State Veterinary Department in the MOA.&#13;
Ministry of Environment&#13;
3.11            The MOE would implement the Project through its relevant line departments. The MOE's&#13;
Department of Environment and Water (DEW) would be responsible for operational coordination at the&#13;
working level (among the two implementing departments within the MOE,4 and between the MOE and&#13;
the MOA) and for ensuring that the environmental requirements of the Project's components are fulfilled.&#13;
The Land Board would be responsible for implementation of the land reform component.&#13;
3.12            The Department of Environment and Water5 in addition to its coordinating role with the&#13;
MOE and the MOA, would be responsible for the environmental screening of the drainage rehabilitation&#13;
component. The County Environmental Departments (CEDs) are responsible for environmental screening&#13;
of sites proposed for drainage rehabilitation, and would revise agricultural extension materials to include&#13;
environmental issues. Environmental issues of national interest, that may arise from the county level&#13;
screening of the drainage sites, would be referred by the CEDs to the DEW for appropriate actions. DEW&#13;
would manage the Wetlands Management Strategy Study and the Environmental Studies for Future&#13;
Drainage Investments.6&#13;
3.13            Estonia National Land Board. The ENLB will be responsible for: (a) development of&#13;
cadastral registration and cadastral mapping in Estonia; (b) overseeing the decentralization of cadastral&#13;
work to the county level; (c) streamlining the surveying and registration process; and (d) ensuring&#13;
coordination with the Title Book Offices. The ENLB will be responsible for contracting out all the survey&#13;
contracts through competitive bidding procedures, and for supervising the contracts. The ENLB would&#13;
appoint staff required for the coordination of the land reform component and would closely liaise with the&#13;
Land Reform Commission'. A Contract Administration Unit (CA 11 will be established in ENLB to&#13;
organize and supervise the contracting of the land survey works. The CAU will organize this competitive&#13;
bidding and perform relevant accounting functions. The project coordinator of the CAU would coordinate&#13;
with the local municipalities, the relevant ministries, and other involved authorities. Survey contracts will&#13;
be prepared together with the local municipalities. At negotiations an agreement was reached, that, by&#13;
June 30, 1996, the Borrower would establish a Contract Administration Unity with a manager and four&#13;
staff to manage and supervise the land survey contracts (technical services) (para 5. 1 (k)).&#13;
4       Including the supply of Project-financed equipment to the Estonian Environmental Research Laboratory.&#13;
MThe Environmental Impact Analysis and Normative Department (EIA Department) would provide support for&#13;
environmental screening and impact analysis for Project components, particularly drainage rehabilitation, and would participate&#13;
in developing the environmental screening criteria and procedures for all drainage rehabilitation investments.&#13;
6       The Nature Conservation Department would also participate in the Wetlands Management Strategy Study, and provide&#13;
inputs to support the environmental screening criteria for the drainage investments.&#13;
7      The Land Reform Commission is mandated to coordinate land policy for GOE and legislators. The Commission&#13;
consists of representatives of the Ministries of Justice, Agriculture, and Environment, the National Land Board, and members of&#13;
Parliament. The Commission was established and is working since June 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                                                Chapter III&#13;
C. Participation&#13;
3.14          The preparation of the Project has involved representatives of the Govermment,&#13;
environmental NGO's, local authorities, and outside experts in preparing detailed project implementation&#13;
plans for each component. In addition, through technical assistance and the Bank's own staff efforts,' the&#13;
participatory approach has been introduced for the design of the drainage rehabilitation works, assessment&#13;
of the potential environmental impacts of drainage rehabilitation, and for the formation of the LWAs. The&#13;
Project will ensure that the farmers, organized in LWAs, will be involved throughout the process, assisting&#13;
in the design, and contributing to the implementation of the rehabilitation works. The Project would&#13;
utilize this participatory approach in the development of the national Agricultural Extension Plan. This&#13;
involvement of stakeholders (farmers and advisors) in the design of both the drainage and the agricultural&#13;
advisory systems could result in new grass roots farmers' organizations (LWAs) developing a range of&#13;
additional services to members such as input supply, machinery pools,9 marketing and possibly credit.&#13;
D. Implementation Schedule&#13;
3.15          The time-based implementation schedules for each of the Project components, and the&#13;
major sub-components are included in the individual Project Implementation Plans (PIPs) of Project&#13;
components, as well as in the "Implementation Plan Summary" (Annexes -Volume 2).&#13;
E. Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.16          The Borrower's records and accounts of the Project, including the Special Account, for&#13;
each fiscal year would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and furnished to the&#13;
Bank within four months after the end of each year. (para 5.1J()). The audit reports would contain&#13;
separate opinions on: (a) compliance by implementing agencies with relevant covenants of the Loan&#13;
Agreement with the Bank; (b) the Statements of Expenditures (SOE); and (c) the Special Account. The&#13;
Bank required audits would not cover donor funded activities, even if supervised by the Bank.&#13;
F. Reporting and Evaluation&#13;
3.17          The implementing line agencies responsible for various aspects of the Project would&#13;
prepare quarterly reports covering progress in the physical implementation of the Project, the use of&#13;
Project funds and, where appropriate, the Project's impact. The format of these reports would be agreed&#13;
with the Bank. The reports would be consolidated by the PSC into semi-annual progress reports to be&#13;
submitted through MOF to the Bank, and relevant co-financiers within two months of the end of each six-&#13;
month reporting period. These semi-annual progress reports would also include an implementation plan&#13;
and work program for the six months following the reporting period. The results of environmental&#13;
screening shall be included in the semi-annual progress reports for the drainage investments.&#13;
Including use of the Bank's Fund for Innovative Approaches in Human and Social Development (FLAHS).&#13;
9      Presently being facilitated with technical assistance to fanners' groups funded by the Danish Consultant Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                               33&#13;
3.18          The Borrower would monitor and evaluate (M&amp;E) the Project on an ongoing basis using&#13;
performance indicators satisfactory to the Bank,'° and would prepare a mid-term review of the Project's&#13;
performance by April 1, 1998, which analyzes the results of the M&amp;E. The Borrower would review this&#13;
report, and the GOE's plan for future implementation taking into account the conclusions of the M&amp;E&#13;
analysis, with the Bank by end-June, 1998 (para. 5.1 (m)). This report would also include proposals for&#13;
any necessary revisions to the Project Implementation Plans.&#13;
3.19          Upon completion of the Project, the MOF, with the collaboration of the implementing line&#13;
agencies, would prepare a Implementation Completion Report (ICR) with a scope satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
to be submitted to the Bank within six months after Project completion.&#13;
G. Bank Supervision&#13;
3.20          Given that there is, as yet, limited experience with implementing Bank Projects in Estonia,&#13;
as well as the fact that the Project covers several aspects of both public and private sector rural&#13;
development, there would be a significant role for Bank supervision. The supervision missions would use&#13;
the Project Objectives and Development Indicators (Annex 2) for the M&amp;E of the Project. It is&#13;
recommended that Bank supervision include":&#13;
(a)  a Project-launch mission to establish with the implementing Ministries, the operational, accounting&#13;
and reporting procedures for the Special Account;&#13;
(b)  semi-annual supervision missions, to review the status of Project implementation and assist with&#13;
any issues that might arise. The first supervision mission would take place within six months of&#13;
effectiveness;&#13;
(c)  an implementation review to be carried out within 12 months after loan effectiveness to determine&#13;
any revisions that might be needed in the implementation plan; this implementation review would&#13;
be conducted in conjunction with a supervision mission;&#13;
(d)  a mid-term  review, not later than end-June 1998, to be carried out in conjunction with a&#13;
supervision mission, based on the review of M&amp;E performance indicators as of end-December&#13;
1997;&#13;
(e)  desk reviews of environmental screening and environmental impact assessments, if prepared,&#13;
specific drainage investment Projects for consistency with World Bank Operational Directive 4.01,&#13;
"Environmental Assessment;"&#13;
(f)  recognition of the importance of effective implementation of "environmental screening procedures"&#13;
to the success of the drainage rehabilitation component, field based supervision would be&#13;

their effectiveness and transferability to future activities; and&#13;

3.21          Given the wide range of activities being covered by this Project, most of the above-&#13;
mentioned supervision responsibilities may require, at appropriate times, a wider range of technical skills&#13;
from supervising staff and consultants than would normally be required. In addition, the Bank would&#13;
jointly supervise, with EU (Phare) and the MOA, the technical assistance for the development of the&#13;
agricultural extension financed by EU (Phare). Some additional staff time might be required for other&#13;
overlapping donor-supported technical assistance to coordinate these activities with the Project. However,&#13;
because this technical assistance is not formally being co-financed under this Project, the donors would&#13;
be responsible for their own direct supervision of their technical assistance activities.&#13;

IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits and Justification'&#13;
4.1           The major benefits are:&#13;
*      accelerated development of a rural land market;&#13;
*      increased agricultural production and farm income in the drainage rehabilitation areas;&#13;
*      improved farmers' information on new farming technologies and management practices;&#13;
*      development of grassroots rural institutions;&#13;
*      improved food and livestock quality standards to protect consumers and increase export&#13;
potential of food and livestock products to the EU;&#13;
*      protection of the environment through environmental controls in agriculture, drainage, and&#13;
wetlands management; and&#13;
*      revitalization and development of farms, services and enterprises that would create&#13;
additional employment opportunities in rural areas.&#13;
4.2           Country and Agricultural Strategv. The Project supports the GOE's strategy to transform&#13;
the rural sector, through support of private agricultural and rural initiatives, into an economically viable&#13;
and competitive market-based system. The Project selectively provides investments to improve existing&#13;
key infrastructure in target areas (farm drainage rehabilitation), strengthens the public agricultural&#13;
extension service and supports the development of private agricultural advisors, and enhances food quality&#13;
control functions. The Project focuses on investments that initiate a gradual transfer of Government&#13;
functions to the private sector (advisory services, drainage maintenance), or improve core Government&#13;
functions (food quality control, public advisory services, environmental controls in agriculture).&#13;
4.3           Scope of the Analysis and Summary Results. The financial and economic analysis is&#13;
divided into two sections: (a) The financial and economic farm model analysis of the profitability of crop&#13;
and livestock production, which shows an estimated ERR of 16% (the farm model analysis shows that the&#13;
Project investments in drainage rehabilitation and private extension, if complemented by privately financed&#13;
on-farm investments in farm assets, would increase farm incomes by 40% after two years compared to&#13;
a situation without Project); (b) the major economic benefits and the expected impact of the Project&#13;
investments on Government expenditures of each component are analyzed, partially using cost-&#13;
effectiveness analysis.&#13;
I     The Economic and Financial Analysis of the Project is described in detail in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                                    Chapter IV&#13;
B. Financial and Economic Farm Model Analysis&#13;
4.4           Dairy farming is the dominant farming system in Estonia, and has the highest potential&#13;
to develop into a profitable enterprise. The farm model analysis assesses the impact of the Project&#13;
investments in farrn drainage rehabilitation and agricultural advisory services on farm income from dairy&#13;
farms. In order to increase farm production and returns to capital and labor on a dairy farm, investments&#13;
in drainage rehabilitation and agricultural advisory services have to be accompanied by other investments,&#13;
typically in buildings (farm buildings, milking parlor), machinery (milking system), or livestock (milking&#13;
cows). The farm model analysis therefore provides a financial and economic rate of return of the Project&#13;
investments in drainage and advisory services in conjunction with assumed complementary privately&#13;
financed investments in farm machinery, livestock and buildings. The investments would be self-financed&#13;
or financed through commercial bank loans.&#13;
4.5           The impact of a combined investment in drainage rehabilitation, advisory services for&#13;
promotion of improved pasture and livestock management supported through the Project, and the privately&#13;
financed on-farm investments in farm buildings, livestock and machinery are evaluated using a model of&#13;
a 25-ha private dairy farm. In the model calculation, the bulk of the investment costs (estimated at about&#13;
EEK 90,000) can be attributed to buildings, machinery, and livestock (88% of the combined investment&#13;
costs),2 whereas the corresponding costs to the farmer for drainage rehabilitation and advisory services are&#13;
considerably lower (9% and 3% respectively of the combined investment costs).3&#13;
4.6           The Financial Rate of Return (FRR) of drainage rehabilitation, agricultural advisory&#13;
services and the complementary privately financed investments in farm assets is estimated at 22% for the&#13;
model farm. This FRR is based on the farmers' contribution to the investment requirements, the&#13;
incremental benefits of these investments, and the projected incremental costs of agricultural production.&#13;
4.7            Farm Income and Farmers' Debt Servicing Capacitv. Assuming a fanner would take a&#13;
loan (EEK 90,000; 10 year maturity; 2 year grace period; 4% real interest rate) to improve a 25 ha dairy&#13;
farrn, a farmer could service the loan and after two years achieve an annual income that would be 40%&#13;
higher than without the investment. Nine years after the initial investment, the model farm would provide&#13;
a monthly income of EEK 1,130 per person4, which is comparable to the national average wage and nearly&#13;
twice as high as the average farm wage. Model calculations for larger farms (50 ha and 100 ha) show&#13;
that the profitability further increases with economies of scale.&#13;
4.8           Farm Model Economic Analysis. The economic analysis of the farm models uses import&#13;
parity prices for cereals and fertilizers.4 All other input and output prices have been converted using a&#13;
standard conversion factor of 1.0, equating financial and economic prices.5 The economic costs for&#13;
2      Farm credits are available from commercial banks refinanced through ARLCF. The GOE has allocated EEK 100&#13;
million in 1996 to ARLCF for on-lending to farmers,&#13;
3      Farmers would contribute 20% of the rehabilitation investments and around 10% of the costs of the advisory services,&#13;
with the GOE covering the balances on a grant basis.&#13;
4      Using constant end 1994 prices.&#13;
5      Because of Estonia's open economy and the absence of tariff barriers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                               37&#13;
investments in drainage rehabilitation and advisory services reflect the full costs of these investments to&#13;
the economy, i.e. they include both the farmer's and the GOE's portion of these investments.&#13;
4.9           The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the farm model is estimated at 16% and the Net&#13;
Present Value (NPV) is EEK 31,000 for a 25 ha farm model. The ERR is lower than the FRR in the&#13;
financial analysis reflecting the full investment costs for drainage rehabilitation and agricultural advisory&#13;
services to the economy.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis for the Farm Model&#13;
4.10          Overall, the ERR of the farm models is not sensitive to significant changes in costs and&#13;
benefits: benefits would need to fall by 24% or costs increase by 31% for the ERR to fall to 10% (i.e.&#13;
with a net present value of zero). If the benefits are delayed by two years, the ERR would drop to 11%.&#13;
In addition, a risk analysis6 for key assumptions, including: (a) inadequate rehabilitation and maintenance&#13;
of the drainage systems beyond the project period; and (b) change of key agricultural output prices, has&#13;
been prepared. The risk analysis shows that the ERR is sensitive to shortfalls in projected crop yield that&#13;
might occur if drainage systems are not maintained. To ensure the projected yields are achieved in the&#13;
Project area, the Project therefore carefully targets the investments to the high potential agricultural areas&#13;
where farmers arguably have the highest incentives to maintain the infrastructure. Farmers' participation&#13;
during rehabilitation and subsequent privatization of the drainage infrastructure would also promote a sense&#13;
of ownership and responsibility for maintaining the drainage system. The crop and milk yield assumptions&#13;
of the "with Project scenario" have been conservatively estimated and are not more than 10% higher than&#13;
current average actual yields in Estonia. The risk of cost overruns is reduced by limiting rehabilitation&#13;
expenditures to EEK 1,500 per hectare. It is also unlikely that crop or livestock prices would fall by more&#13;
than 20%, due to the currently depressed output prices caused by the inefficient processing sector.&#13;
C. Analysis of Benefits by Component&#13;
4.11          This section provides an analysis of the economic benefits of the expected development&#13;
impact of each component. However, as illustrated in the farm model analysis, many of the benefits of&#13;
the components are interrelated and can not be analyzed, or achieved, in isolation.&#13;
Land Reform&#13;
4.12          Benefits.  The Project would support the development of a rural land market by&#13;
accelerating the registration of rural land in the cadastre and title book. These measures would (a)&#13;
facilitate the access of farmers to long-term credit because commercial banks would be more inclined to&#13;
accept land with a secure, transferable and mortgageable title as collateral, and (b) increase the movement&#13;
of agricultural land through sale or lease to efficient agricultural producers, thereby increasing agricultural&#13;
production and incomes.&#13;
4.13          Cost Effectiveness Analysis.  Land with a registered, secure, transfereable and&#13;
mortgageable title could be used as collateral to obtain a long-term mortgage loan from a commercial&#13;
bank. The benefit of land title registration could be assessed as the difference between the interest rate&#13;
6      See Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                                                    Chapter IV&#13;
for a long-term mortgage loan which is typically lower than the interest rate of a loan of the same maturity&#13;
using a moveable collateral (currently about 20 - 25%). A simple cost-effectiveness analysis shows that&#13;
a reduction of the interest rate for a loan of EEK 100,000 (10 years maturity, no grace period, constant&#13;
principal repayment) by 2% would be sufficient to cover the estimated costs of EEK 9,625 for land&#13;
surveys and cadastre registration of an average 25 ha farm. The component would have substantial&#13;
financial and economic benefits for the economy by supporting the development of mortgage banking.&#13;
4.14          Cost Recovery. The GOE plans to recover the costs for the land surveys from the&#13;
property owners. For this purpose, the GOE is developing incentives to assist the owners in financing&#13;
land surveys and registration in the cadastre and title book. The land surveys would be conducted by&#13;
around 200 private surveying companies operating in Estonia.&#13;
Farm Drainage Rehabilitation&#13;
4.15          The Project would finance rehabilitation of drainage systems on about 60,000 ha of the&#13;
most productive drained farmland, covering less than 10% of the total drained farmland in the country.&#13;
Well maintained and functioning drainage systems are a pre-requisite to increasing the efficiency of&#13;
Estonian livestock farms. After fully rehabilitating the drainage system in the Project area, crop&#13;
production would increase by about 11,000 tons of feed grain, 35,000 tons of hay, and 12,000 tons of&#13;
potato annually. The incremental production of feed grain and hay, even though these crops could be&#13;
valued with market prices, is only used as an intermediate good for dairy and livestock production and&#13;
should not be valued separately'. The farm model analysis therefore provides the best approximation of&#13;
the benefits of drainage rehabilitation. In addition, the organization of farmers in LWAs and the&#13;
involvement of the farmers in the design of the drainage system could also result in new community&#13;
services provided by these LWAs such as input supplies, machinery pools, marketing and possibly credit.&#13;
Tlhe drainage rehabilitation investments would directly benefit small local contractors carrying out the civil&#13;
works and also stimulate the development of other rural support services to agriculture in the rural areas.&#13;
4.16          Cost Recoverv. The GOE plans to privatize the ownership, operations, and maintenance&#13;
of all farm drainage systems by handing over these systems to LWAs after completion of the drainage&#13;
rehabilitation works. Each LWA must agree to contribute (in cash or in kind) 20% of the cost of the&#13;
rehabilitation works, the remaining 80% would be covered by the GOE with budget and Project loan&#13;
funds. In return, the GOE would, post-rehabilitation, no longer accept any further financial responsibility&#13;
for these on-farm drainage systems. Each LWA would have full ownership of its area-specific drainage&#13;
system and bear its full O&amp;M costs. This will reduce the GOE's future investment costs in rehabilitating&#13;
drainage systems and its recurrent expenditures for operation and maintenance of these systems.&#13;
Agricultural Advisory Services&#13;
4.17          Benefits.  Extension plays a key role in the dissemination of information on new&#13;
technologies, and improved organizational and management practices. Research results confirm the&#13;
significant and positive impact of extension in many countries. Extension would likely have a substantial&#13;
7      A separate economic rate of return has been calculated for the farm drainage rehabilitation component and is estimated&#13;
at 23% and the NPV at EEK 26 million. Estimated benefits include the incremental production of feed grains, hay and potato&#13;
valued at local market prices. Costs include all rehabilitation investments,O&amp;M costs and costs for establishment of LWAs over&#13;
15 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project                                                             39&#13;
impact on the transformation of the Estonian farming sector to a market oriented production system.&#13;
However, the benefits of extension during the transition period are extremely difficult to quantify due to&#13;
the paucity of data and the lack of experience in similar situations. Evidence from an extension project&#13;
in northern Estonia shows that minor improvements such as adequate maintenance of the milking&#13;
equipment results in significant quality improvements. Quality improvements would substantially increase&#13;
farm income because of the large difference in payment for low quality and high quality milk.&#13;
4.18         Public versus Private Advisory Services. The Project assists the establishment of a new&#13;
advisory system in Estonia consisting of a public and a private extension service. The Private Advisory&#13;
Services Development Fund requires only an initial investment, because the farmers are expected (in the&#13;
medium-term) to fully pay for advice that directly benefits their farm operation. Over an eight year period&#13;
the GOE's contribution to the private advisory service would be gradually phased out. In addition, the&#13;
GOE, with Project support, would continue to provide advice to farmers who can not afford the private&#13;
advisory services, but only with public domain technical information. The GOE would therefore reduce&#13;
its active involvement in extension to a more strategic and supervisory role, thereby containing recurrent&#13;
Government expenditures for extension.&#13;
Food Quality Control and Veterinary Services&#13;
4.19         Benefits. The Project would improve state food quality and veterinary laboratories in&#13;
order to protect domestic and foreign consumers, and increase the export potential of agricultural products.&#13;
The Project investments are aimed at enhancing and monitoring the quality of food and livestock products&#13;
in accordance with EU regulations.&#13;
4.20         Cost Effectiveness Analysis. Estonia does not fully use the quota for livestock exports&#13;
to the EU at the favorable import tariff, which is 60% less than actual tariffs. If Estonian livestock&#13;
products meet EU standards, the fulfillment of the quota would result in a tariff reduction of US $5 - 6&#13;
million over the next three years. The component investments (US $1.2 million) could therefore initiate&#13;
production quality improvements at the farm level and in the food processing industries. However, private&#13;
sector investments in production facilities at the farm level and at the agro-processing level would have&#13;
to complement the Project investments to increase the quality of food and livestock products.&#13;
4.21         Public versus Private Investment and Cost Recoverv. The Project supports the initial&#13;
phase of a broader program to improve Estonia's food quality at the production, processing and marketing&#13;
level. Part of the future control functions would most likely be undertaken by private laboratories, but&#13;
some of these functions would remain in Government hands. It is expected that the Veterinary Laboratory&#13;
would charge for the tests to partially recover costs.&#13;
Land Use Management&#13;
4.22         Benefits. This component is aimed at strengthening environmental controls in agriculture&#13;
to minimize negative external effects of agricultural production on the environment. The MOE would&#13;
actively participate in developing environmentally sustainable agriculture in Estonia. In addition, the MOE&#13;
would receive Project support to develop and enforce environmental regulations and monitor the impact&#13;
of the drainage rehabilitation investments on the environment.&#13;

40                                                                                Chapter IV&#13;
D. Risks&#13;
4.23          The main Project Management risks and the actions taken to mitigate them are:&#13;
Drainage Rehabilitation:&#13;
Risk:         The commitment and ability of the farmers to pay their share for rehabilitation and to&#13;
undertake the fullfunding offuture operations and the maintenance of their rehabilitated&#13;
drainage systems.&#13;
Mitigation:    LWA formnation is the key mitigating factor; both the MOA staff and group facilitators&#13;
have been trained in the participatory approach to group formation;8 LWA formation will&#13;
have at its core the development of the group's mutual interest in the continuing operation&#13;
of the drainage system; experience from other countries shows that mutual-interest&#13;
LWA's do work, and that group social pressure does contribute to coherence and the&#13;
fulfillment of obligations; no investment in rehabilitation at any site would be undertaken&#13;
if the LWA has not been formed and is not committed to contributing its share of the&#13;
rehabilitation costs and to undertaking all future maintenance.&#13;
Risk:         Iffarmers are unwilling to pay their share of rehabilitation costs, field investments would&#13;
be delayed, and possibly a portion of the loan commitment would not be utilized.&#13;
Mitigation:    Formation of LWAs to receive the loan-funded rehabilitation has been ongoing for about&#13;
a year prior to project effectiveness; target farmners (i.e. only those with good soils) are&#13;
aware that without rehabilitation they would not achieve the required productivity to be&#13;
profitable; the costs of contribution by the farmers is affordable from the post-investment&#13;
incremental benefits, as investment cost is limited to EEK 1,500/ha, of which the farmer&#13;
would pay 20%, much of which would be in kind, with the balance from cash or a&#13;
credit.&#13;
Agricultural Advisory Services:&#13;
Risk:         Farmers are not willing to pay for private advisory services.&#13;
Mitigation:    Farmers would be initiated into the "for-pay" system through the GOE grant partial&#13;
payment for agricultural advisory services, resulting in both familiarization with this&#13;
system and permitting changes in design depending on the farmer responses; farmers and&#13;
advisors would be represented on the National Agricultural Extension Task Force and the&#13;
design of the private service would be responsive to client needs; private agricultural&#13;
advisory services would be targeted only at those farmers with higher income potentials;&#13;
those farmers not willing to pay, or unable to pay, for private extension advice would&#13;
continue to be served by the public extension service, but at a lower frequency of&#13;
contacts, and only with public domain technical information (i.e. no business advice).&#13;

Estonia Agriculture Project                                                               41&#13;
Rural Land Reform:&#13;
Risk:         Implementation of land reform will continue to be slow.&#13;
Mitigation:    The GOE has, in addition to the funds provided under this loan, allocated a substantial&#13;
amount of funds for land reform and land survey works for 1996; the policy study on&#13;
disposal of State-owned rural lands should set the GOE's future action plans; strong&#13;
political willingness of the present government to move land reforms as fast as possible;&#13;
strong desire by all sectors of the population to gain land titles; donor assistance with&#13;
strengthening institutional capacities and developing associated legal reforms.&#13;
Proiect ImRlementation Delays:&#13;
Risk:         A longer implementation period than planned would be required, due to limited local&#13;
implementation capacity and extensive farmers 'participation.&#13;
Mitigation:    Pre-launch training in participation techniques;9 donor assisted technical assistance for the&#13;
advisory service already in the field; the longer term benefits of assuring stakeholder&#13;
participation and ownership justifies the risk of a slower implementation schedule: the&#13;
project implementation schedule has taken into account a realistic time period for the&#13;
effective development of stakeholder participation and ownership.&#13;
Com2lementarv Private Sector Investments:&#13;
Risk:         The private sector would not complement the Project investments with privately financed&#13;
investments.&#13;
Mitigation:   Training and advisory services promoting investment opportunities and explaining&#13;
financial possibilities supported through technical assistance under the Project would assist&#13;
the private sector with investments: registration of secure, transfereable and mortgageable&#13;
land titles would facilitate the use of land as collateral to obtain long-term loans from the&#13;
private sector. The economic analysis shows satisfactory benefits of the proposed&#13;
investments even in the (unlikely) absence of complementary investments.&#13;

Complementary Donor-funded Technical Assistance&#13;
1.    This annex presents the Technical Assistance Program identified jointly by GOE and the&#13;
Bank, within the framework of the strategy of agriculture, forestry and the rural economy, and&#13;
considered to be complementary to the investments funded under the project.&#13;
2.    For some of the items, donor-funds have been committed (time is noted where&#13;
appropriate). For the remainder GOE, is seeking interested donors.&#13;
Land Reform&#13;
3.    Land Registry Management Advice (1996-98) provides assistance to the local land registry&#13;
and title book offices. This program will be carried out by SwedSurvey and financed by BITS&#13;
as part of a larger program which has been agreed in principle to start in 1996 and continue up&#13;
to 1998.&#13;
4.    Land Assessment Methodology Development (95-96) A land assessment methodology has&#13;
been developed in close cooperation with Finnish experts as part of an ongoing project.&#13;
5.    Land and Real Estate Legal Advice (96-98) provides advice to private real estate agents&#13;
in all legal aspects of land markets. This program has been intensively reviewed and two&#13;
possible donors - Sweden (BITS financing) and Austria have been identified.&#13;
6.    Training of Surveyors (95-97) provides training for trainers in surveying, and will later&#13;
offer courses on the use of equipment and software purchased under the first phase of the EU&#13;
Phare-funded LIMPE-project. This aspect is included in the ongoing LIMPE-project and in&#13;
fiurther TA programs that are currently being developed.&#13;
7.    Training of Cadastral Specialists (96-97) provides training for the local cadastral&#13;
specialists in using a modem cadastral system. This program would be primarily included in a&#13;
EU-PHARE-program, and some part of the program would be covered by BITS and SwedSurvey.&#13;
Forest Institutions Strengthening&#13;
8.    Forest Strategy Study'. This study will review and recommend structural changes to the&#13;
forest sector as well as operational strategies and investment plans, with the overall objective to&#13;
achieve a proper balance between environmental, social and economic aspects of the sector. It&#13;
would include an assessment of appropriate user fees for public and private harvesting of wood&#13;
Finnish Governnent funded&#13;

resources to ensure that reflect the current value of the resources and that fees for public owned&#13;
resources are adequate to cover their management and site rehabilitation costs.&#13;
9.          National Forest Inventorv. In principle all forest land in Estonia is covered by&#13;
forest management plans which are renewed on a ten-year rotation. The information from these&#13;
plans will be used as a base for simulations analyzing future available volumes from the Estonian&#13;
forests. The National Forest Inventory will consist of a systematic pattern of sample plots&#13;
covering the whole country, regardless of land use, which will be carefully measured in order to&#13;
form a statistically controllable database to be used for estimating total standing stock, age and&#13;
species distributions, areas of forest types, vegetation cover, etc. These results will be used to&#13;
calibrate the forecasts based on the forest management plans and to verify regularly that the&#13;
national forest resource and related biodiversity is managed on a sustainable level.&#13;
10.         Assistance to the Forestry Department. Technical assistance in the transformation&#13;
to market economy, and in the implementation of market economic mechanisms which have been&#13;
tested and developed as part of the Suure-Jaani project2 and defined as concrete strategies by the&#13;
Forest Strategy Study.&#13;
11.         Suure-Jaani Proiect. This Danish funded forest management project which has&#13;
now been operational for a little more than a year has been successful in introducing new&#13;
management principles and planning and control systems for a state forest region. It is important&#13;
to maintain the momentum of these achievements and continue the process so that it can be used&#13;
as a demonstration site of best practices for the Forest Strategy Study's consideration, and also&#13;
a test and demonstration area for proposals that emerge from the Forest Strategy Study.&#13;
12.         Implementation of Forest Stratey is the implementation phase of the Forest&#13;
Strategy Study, focusing on the management of the State Forests. This assistance would include&#13;
expatriate advisors to guide the forest administration in implementing recommended management&#13;
strategies. This assistance should also include support for the new forest regulatory institution,&#13;
which will be defined by the Forest Strategy Study.&#13;
13.         Training. The experiences gained in Suure-Jaani should now be used for a large&#13;
scale training program for the Forest Department. All levels of staff should be trained in&#13;
practical applications for economic and financial decisions, software systems, planning, budgeting&#13;
and control of forest operations, accounting, business administration, marketing and environmental&#13;
management. The training should be organized in a form that expatriate specialists train local&#13;
instructors, who gradually take over the whole program and turn it into a continuous education&#13;
and training unit. This training unit could also assist forest owners associations to set up special&#13;
courses for private owners on selected subjects.&#13;

14.         Forest Research. Technical assistance to support a forest research program and&#13;
which would lead to the Forest Strategy Study.&#13;
15.         EU-Phare Support to Forestry. A certain amount of the EU-Phare program has&#13;
been earmarked for forestry support. At this stage this component has not been further defined,&#13;
but in principle these funds will be used for improving the information systems within the Forest&#13;
Department and as a complement to the other funding.&#13;
Rural Private Enterprise Development&#13;
16.         With the prirmary objective of fostering rural entrepreneurship, the project&#13;
preparation effort has identified a wide range of activities (for donor-financed technical&#13;
assistance) that would directly promote the establishment of rural enterprises.&#13;
17.         Farmer's co-operatives twinning. To achieve economies of scale in production and&#13;
marketing, small producers, which face processing enterprises as markets for their products, need&#13;
to work together in an organized manner, often as members of cooperatives. This will help&#13;
consolidate their bargaining power with cooperative management and with processors. Twinning&#13;
with similar functioning cooperatives in Western Europe and Scandinavia, for training of farmer&#13;
organization and cooperative members, (i.e. not cooperative managers and employees) would be&#13;
an effective means of both increasing empowerment, and of making the cooperatives more&#13;
responsive, competitive and efficient.&#13;
18.         Trade Promotion and Market Information Services. This component aims to&#13;
promote agricultural and food products on domestic and international markets. It will also&#13;
improve the transparency and accessibility of those markets through the establishment of market&#13;
information services. Trade promotion will focus on enhancing the preferences of domestic and&#13;
foreign consumers for Estonian agricultural products as a whole rather than for specific brands.&#13;
Support will be provided through technical assistance and training to an appropriate institution&#13;
(possibly the recently founded Association of Estonian Food Industry) to establish a market&#13;
development unit to offer a variety of services like market and price information for commercial&#13;
producers and intermediaries, and also more broadly-based, policy-oriented information&#13;
monitoring and analysis services.&#13;
19.         Business skills training for rural farm and non-farm enterprises. Training would&#13;
be in commercial, management and business skills necessary for the transition to the market&#13;
economy. The program would target the following five beneficiaries: (a) top- and middle-&#13;
managers of newly privatized agro-processing enterprises and joint-stock large farms (ex-&#13;
kolkhozes and sovkhozes) ;md managers of rural drainage construction companies; (b)&#13;
commercial, marketing, line-mnanagement and accounting staffs of these enterprises; (c) owners&#13;
of (new) private farms; (d) existing small- and medium-scale rural entrepreneurs; and (e)&#13;
farmers' organizations such as the Land and Water Associations, rural residents in transition from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

farming into rural service and rural enterprises. This training component would utilize the staff&#13;
at Estonian educational and training institutions operating in the rural areas: universities, technical&#13;
institutions, vocational training schools, farmers' support organizations.&#13;
20.          Farm machinery services-private sector development. Tailored to the services&#13;
provided by Germany in its transformation of agriculture in the new "Laender", this training&#13;
component targets Estonian farm co-operative recipients of donated Danish farm machinery. The&#13;
training emphasizes how to utilize this machinery to provide services on a fee basis to other&#13;
farmers, and how to avoid building overcapacity for individuals.&#13;
21.          Agro-processing engineering consultancy joint ventures. Both the major agro-&#13;
processors and the smaller scale farm-level processors require professional technical engineering&#13;
advisory services for the design and upgrading of existing plant, and the introduction of new&#13;
product lines. This is particularly important for two objectives:&#13;
(a) effective cost reductions in processing through efficiency improvement in installed&#13;
capacity; and&#13;
(b) upgrading to meet EU import food standards regulations.&#13;
22.          Estonia design engineers who wish to enter this new private sector field, that is,&#13;
a for-a-fee engineering consulting business environment, could be teamed with experienced&#13;
engineering consulting firms to form local joint-ventures. Such ventures would initially provide&#13;
services based largely on technical expertise and experience of foreign companies. Over time the&#13;
foreign expertise would be replaced with local expertise, and the role of the joint venture&#13;
partnership would be to provide technical back-stopping as a conduit for new technologies and&#13;
design innovations based on other countries' experiences.&#13;
23.          Because the Estonian industry cannot afford the fees of external design consultants,&#13;
the purpose in seeking donor assistance is therefore two-fold:&#13;
(a) to ease the cost of entry for their national consulting firms to establish these knowledge-&#13;
based joint ventures in Estonia; and&#13;
(b) to effectively subsidize the fee structure for these advisory services until both the internal&#13;
cost structure of the consulting firms decreases (due to increasing involvement of local&#13;
staff expertise) and the ability of local agro-processing enterprises to pay increases.&#13;
24.          Agro-enterprise and farm  management advisory/consultancy joint-ventures is&#13;
proposed as a service to the emerging agro-industry private sector. This TA component is ideally&#13;
targeted for those Bank loan recipients of major agro-processing investments which require&#13;
management advice during the transition period. Similar assistance is needed to developing farm&#13;
management and business advisory and training services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

25.          Aaro-industry Studies Review. Past bilateral technical assistance provided strategic&#13;
studies for the privatization, restructuring and future market prospects for the major agro-&#13;
processing complexes (meat, dairy, grains). There is now a much-needed domestic and export&#13;
market re-analyses in order to assess optimum capacity levels. These studies will enable&#13;
individual enterprises in each sub-sector to make strategic decisions, and will assist banks in their&#13;
assessment of the viability of enterprise business and investment proposals.&#13;
26.          Joint-Venture Incentives for Forestry Nurseries. This would be a process of&#13;
utilizing export credits, bilateral grants for feasibility studies and World Bank credit lines in order&#13;
to establish two state of the art nurseries to supply the Estonian market with high quality&#13;
containerized planting stock.&#13;
27.          Support for the formation of private forest service companies. Such companies&#13;
should be able to offer services like forest planning, silviculture operations and harvesting on a&#13;
contractual basis. They should also be able to sign full management contracts for absent forest&#13;
owners. The intention is to set up a multitude of such small companies, some of which would&#13;
be initiated by entrepreneurial former employees of the Forest Department local districts who&#13;
might be superfluous once the restitution process takes off.&#13;
28.          Institutional strengthening for environmental impact assessment.  Technical&#13;
assi.tance would be used to provide the Ministry of the Environment's Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment Department with additional capacity to address environmental issues associated with&#13;
the review and approval of agriculture and forestry projects. Counterparts in donor countries with&#13;
experience addressing environmental problems in the agriculture and forestry sector would be&#13;
identified to participate. Donors with particular expertise in projects involving agro-processing,&#13;
forestry wood processing, environmental health and hygiene, and agricultural runoff would be&#13;
sought.&#13;
29.          Strategic advice on wood industry lending. Many of the commercial banks which&#13;
will operate the FIDP credit line have limited knowledge and experience of financing wood&#13;
processing and forestry investments. This support would consist of organizing reviews of existing&#13;
credit applications, workshops on specific aspects of forest investment and on the job training.&#13;
If in this process the quality of credit applications from the forestry sector appear to be&#13;
incomplete and/or badly presented, the assistance should be extended to the companies applying&#13;
for credit. This activity would support preparation of environmental review procedures to be used&#13;
by commercial banks consistent with the procedures now being developed by MoE (with the&#13;
Bank under FIDP) for intermediate credit activities in Estonia (donor financed).&#13;

ESTONIA&#13;
AGRICULTURE PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    In the financial and economic analysis, the Project benefits of the drainage rehabilitation&#13;
component and the agricultural advisory component are going to be quantified in terms of the output of&#13;
dairy and beef products. This analysis will be based on a dairy farm model of a typical 25 ha dairy farm&#13;
in Estonia. Dairy farms of that size are now the dominating farm type producing the bulk of the&#13;
agricultural output and have the largest potential to develop into profitable businesses. Drainage&#13;
rehabilitation will increase the agricultural production of mainly forage crops and to a lesser extent cereals&#13;
and potatoes. Rehabilitation and good maintenance of drainage systems are a key pre-requisite to improve&#13;
the efficiency of livestock and crop production in Estonia. A well drained field has a growing season&#13;
that is about a month longer than under wet conditions which then in turn allows higher crop yields or&#13;
pasture improvements with nitrogen-fixing legumes. Increasing fodder production will in turn increase&#13;
dairy and livestock production and lower production costs. Through the agricultural advisory services&#13;
component, farmers will have access to advise on improved technologies or farm management methods&#13;
through the support to the agricultural advisory service.&#13;
2.    Scope of the Analysis. This annex consists of: (a) a financial and economic farm model analysis&#13;
of the profitability of dairy and beef production; and (b) an analysis of economic benefits by Project&#13;
component.&#13;
C. FARM MODEL ANALYSIS&#13;
3.    The farm model analysis assesses the impact of the Project investments in farm drainage&#13;
rehabilitation and agricultural advisory services on farm income from dairy farms (the dominant farm type&#13;
in Estonia). However, dairy farmers would in many cases have to invest in, for instance, expanding the&#13;
herd size, or in new machinery for milking and fodder production to fully utilize the better drained fields&#13;
and use the advice offered by the extension services. The farm model analysis therefore provides a&#13;
financial and economic rate of return of the Project investments in drainage and advisory services in&#13;
combination with assumed complementary privately financed investments in farm machinery, livestock&#13;
and buildings. These Project benefits can only be evaluated accurately in conjunction with additional&#13;
privately financed on-farm investments through the farm model and not separately by component.&#13;
4.    Financial Prices and technical coefficients. Commodity prices and unit costs of production inputs&#13;
are based on actual end 1994 farmgate prices'. Farmgate prices for crop and livestock products closely&#13;
correspond to the world market prices. Production inputs (including seeds, fertilizers and agro-chemicals)&#13;
have been estimated based on information obtained from the Agricultural Research Institute in Saku and&#13;
verified through observations in the field. In the absence of reliable farm budget accounts, the costs of&#13;
I At appraisal in June 1995, harvest prices for 1995 were not yet available but the price/cost relation has not&#13;
changed from end 1994 to mid 1995.&#13;

Estonian conditions. Quoted rental prices obtained from individual farm machine operators are&#13;
comparable to these estimated costs. The crop budgets and farm models have been discussed with staff&#13;
of the Dept. of Agricultural Economics, University of Tartu. The farm models are indicative and reflect&#13;
changes which are likely to occur on farms that have access to agricultural advice, medium-term farm&#13;
credit resources and a well functioning drainage system.&#13;
5.    Profitability of Crop Production. The profitability of the main value adding sub-sector, dairy&#13;
production, depends on a certain yield level below which the production of fodder crops and cereals would&#13;
not be profitable. The necessary crop yield level can generally only be obtained with adequate drainage.&#13;
Most of the analyzed crops, except potatoes, are intermediate goods and used as livestock feed. Therefore&#13;
the analysis of the FRR and the ERR focus on the impact of investments and increases of dairy and&#13;
livestock production on model dairy farms in Estonia.&#13;
Dairy Farm Models&#13;
6.    Farm models have been developed to evaluate the profitability of dairy farms of varying sizes and&#13;
different technology levels. The financial dairy farm models are developed to assess: (a) the current&#13;
profitability of dairy farms; (b) the financial rate of return of on-farm  investments in drainage&#13;
rehabilitation, agricultural advisory services and complementary privately financed farm assets; (c)&#13;
potential demand for loans, loan conditions, and debt service capacity of a model dairy farm, and (d) the&#13;
economic rate of return of on-farm investments in drainage rehabilitation, agricultural advisory services&#13;
and privately financed complementary farm assets. The complementary on-farm investments would be&#13;
either self-financed or financed through loans obtained from commercial banks and are not provided under&#13;
the Project.&#13;
7.    Four different dairy farm types are analyzed:&#13;
(a)    A private farm of 25 ha representing present situation and practices, with 11 ha arable&#13;
land, 3 ha grassland, 8 ha forest, and 3 ha of uncultivated land. The farm is oriented&#13;
towards milk production with a herd of 13 cattle including 5 cows. Cropping pattern:&#13;
50% barley and other cereals, 44% pasture for hay and grazing, 1% beet and 5% potato.&#13;
(Without Proiect Scenario).&#13;
(b)    A private farm of 25 ha as in (a) above, assuming changes in land use with crop rotation&#13;
extended to nine years including three years of cultivation and six years of pasture,&#13;
improved pasture management, improved feed conservation and an increase in herd size&#13;
to 21 cattle including 10 cows. It is conservatively assumed that the investments result in&#13;
a yield increase of 0.6 t/ha of barley, 4 tlha of potatoes, 2 tlha of pasture and an increase&#13;
in production of 200 kg of milk per cow. Cropping pattern: 25% barley, 65% pasture&#13;
hay, 5% legumes and 5% potato. (With Proiect Scenario).&#13;
(c)    A hypothetical 50 ha farm with the same management, land use, and cropping pattern as&#13;
proposed for (b) above, with a herd of 45 cattle including 20 cows.&#13;
(d)    A hyRothetical 100 ha farm with the same management, land use, and cropping pattern&#13;
as proposed for (b) above, with a herd of 88 cattle including 40 cows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 3 of 37&#13;
8.     The transformation of a 25 ha dairy farm, from the present condition to a financially profitable&#13;
farm, requires: (a) periodic investments in drainage rehabilitation and maintenance including drainage&#13;
rehabilitation in the first year (EEK 8,200) and again after 9 years and annual maintenance costs over 15&#13;
years2; and (b) investments in advisory services for the promotion of improved pasture and livestock&#13;
management in the first years3 (EEK 2,500); (c) stable expansion/improvement and the acquisition of a&#13;
simple 2 cow bucket milking system (EEK 80,000).  Total investment requirements amount to an&#13;
estimated EEK 91,000 over a period of 4 years.&#13;
9.     The outlined changes in cropping pattern and the yield, increase feed supplies by over 90% from&#13;
35 to 68 tons of dry matter (Farm A to Farm B) and would nearly double the livestock carrying capacity&#13;
of a 25 ha farm. Milk production can be more than doubled from 16,000 liters to 34,000 liters per year&#13;
by reducing the culling rate of cows from 30% to 20%, increasing production by 200 kg per cow, and&#13;
discouraging prolonged retention of males in the herd. The increase in herd size from 5 to 10 cows also&#13;
contributes to a 55% increase in meat production, approximately from 1.5 to 2.3 ton liveweight per year.&#13;
10.    Production costs of milk per liter (excluding labor) decrease from 1.3 EEK/liter to 0.8 EEK/liter,&#13;
given the proportionally larger increase in livestock output. At the current farmgate price of 1.4 EEK/liter&#13;
in constant 1994 terms, the expected return on labor and capital increases six-fold, from 0.1 EEK/liter to&#13;
0.6 EEK/liter of milk produced and sold. Similarly, production costs decrease from 6.5 EEK/kg to 4&#13;
EEK/kg of beef production. At an average price of 7 EEK/kg (liveweight), the expected returns on labor&#13;
and capital would increase fivefold from 0.6 EEK/kg to 3 EEK/kg.&#13;

&#13;

11.   Under the present situation (Farm A), the farm has a positive cash flow, but returns on family&#13;
-labor are negative, assuming an average farm wage of EEK 40 per day. The model therefore accurately&#13;
describes the situation of a large number of farms. After expanding herd size and investing in machinery,&#13;
buildings and improved pasture (Farm B), production costs of milk would decrease and returns on family&#13;
farm labor would increase to more than EEK 40 per work day. As farm and herd size increases (Farms&#13;
C and D), economies of scale further decrease the production costs per unit and consequently labor income&#13;
from the dairy farm would increase. The potential labor income from the improved farm models (Farms&#13;
B, C, D) is more than double the average rural wages in Estonia.&#13;
12.   Total farm income would increase from EEK 15,000 (without project) to EEK 41,000 (with&#13;
project) including forestry income of about 7,600 EEK/year by changing land use and introducing&#13;
improved pasture and livestock management. Even without reaching full employment of 2 family&#13;
members, total returns on labor and capital can be expected to reach more than EEK 1,700 per person per&#13;
month. Assuming a 10% return on invested capital, net returns on farm labor (including forestry) could&#13;
amount to 1,130 EEK/monthWperson, which is about the average per capita income in Estonia.&#13;
13.   Environmental impact. The increase in herd size will lead to an increase in the amount of manure&#13;
produced on the farrn which could increase non-point source pollution from agriculture if appropriate&#13;
mitigation measures are not in place. It will be necessary for the expanding farms to invest in appropriate&#13;
manure storage facilities and technology. In the model calculations, investment costs for appropriate&#13;
manure storage have been included in estimating the costs of expanding the stables. It is further assumed&#13;
that the farms will continue to use the existing technology for spreading manure. All new private&#13;
investment involving the construction of cattle sheds for more than 10 cows have been classified by&#13;
Estonian law as projects of local importance that have to undergo an environmental impact assessment&#13;
before the investment is cleared by the County Environment Department. The Government thereby tries&#13;
to assure that appropriate environmental mitigation measures are included. However, even after increasing&#13;
herd size, the assumed animal density in the model farms will be lower than in many European countries.&#13;
Farm Model Financial Analysis&#13;
14.   The financial rate of return (FRR) for these investments on a 25 ha dairy farm is estimated at 22%&#13;
and the net present value amounts to EEK 46,644. The FRR calculation is based on the following&#13;
assumptions: (a) all costs are in constant end 1994 prices; (b) benefits and costs are calculated for 15&#13;
years; and (c) quantifiable net returns are from incremental dairy and meat production. Recent data&#13;
published by MOA confirm the analysis and indicate that half of the private dairy farms in Estonia show&#13;
a profit in 1994. Dairy farm profitability improved noticeably since 1993, partly due to comparable on-&#13;
farm investments.&#13;
Farmers' Debt Service Capacity&#13;
15.   Farm income of a 25 ha dairy farm, excluding returns on family farm labor and debt service, are&#13;
estimated to be EEK 15,000 under present conditions. During the four year investment period, farm&#13;
income before financing would drop to EEK 12,000 in the first year of the investment, and then increase&#13;
to EEK 21,000 in the second year, EEK 35,000 in the third and stabilize at EEK 40,000 from the fourth&#13;
year onwards. The decline in income in the first year is due to an internal build-up of the herd which&#13;
prevents the sale of livestock during the first year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5 of 37&#13;
16.   The following calculation illustrates loan conditions and debt service obligations that guarantee&#13;
adequate cash incomes for the farmers during the investment period. A loan of EEK 92,000 with a ten&#13;
year maturity including a 2-year grace period during which interest is fully capitalized, a real interest rate&#13;
of 4% per annum (higher than the prevailing market rates), and debt service limited to no more than 40%&#13;
of farm income in any given year would ensure adequate farm income during the entire investment period.&#13;
Under these loan terms, farm income after financing of the 25 ha farm would increase from EEK 12,000&#13;
in the first year to about EEK 21,000 in the second and third year, EEK 24,000 from the fourth to the&#13;
ninth year, and EEK 40,000 after the loan has been fully repaid. Therefore, the estimated minimum&#13;
annual farm income of EEK 21,000 during the loan repayment period would in real terms exceed the&#13;
average rural income.&#13;
17.   The financial analysis shows that the proposed investments will have a large return and could&#13;
therefore be financed by the farmers. The analysis conservatively assumes a high level of necessary&#13;
complementary investments in private assets, even though many of the farms have already partly&#13;
purchased these assets. Therefore, on average, the expected investment in farm assets will be lower than&#13;
anticipated in the analysis. Even if farmers would not achieve the estimated expansion in herd size, the&#13;
agricultural advice would be used for efficiency improvements that do not require complementary&#13;
investments, and, part of the incremental crop production achieved after rehabilitating the drainage systems&#13;
that might not be used on the farms, could be sold to local markets.&#13;
Farm Model Economic Analysis&#13;
18.   Commodity and lnvut Prices. Economic farmgate prices of cereals are calculated using averages&#13;
of quoted CIF Rotterdam prices in 1995 of barley, rye and oats. For the purpose of economic analysis,&#13;
an average import parity farmgate price of EEK 1,101 per ton for cereals is derived by averaging farmgate&#13;
prices of barley, rye and oats. Considering that these cereals are used primarily as livestock feed grains,&#13;
this average farmgate price for cereals is projected by correlating its price movement with the Bank's&#13;
commodity price forecast of May 1995 for grain sorghum for years 1995 to 2005. The calculated&#13;
economic farmgate prices show only minor variations from the actual financial farmgate prices observed.&#13;
The average import parity farmgate prices of these feed grains are projected at EEK 1,055 per ton in 1995&#13;
up to the year 2000, and EEK 979 per ton in year 2005 and thereafter. Import parity prices have been&#13;
calculated for fertilizers and cereals. The economic import parity farmgate prices for N, P, and K&#13;
nutrients are derived from Urea, TSP and KCL prices respectively, based on the Bank's forecast of May&#13;
1995 for the years 1995 to 2005. Estonia is a net importer of these fertilizers. The farmgate import parity&#13;
prices of these nutrients in 1995, expressed in constant 1994 terms, are estimated to be EEK 5.5/kg for&#13;
N, EEK 4.5/kg for P, and EEK 3.0/kg for K. All other input and output prices have been converted using&#13;
a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 1.0, equating financial and economic prices because of the absence&#13;
of any trade restrictions.&#13;
19.   The financial farngate price for milk is also used in the economic analysis. The farmgate milk&#13;
price is not distorted because of Estonia's liberal and open trade and price policy. However, the costs of&#13;
processing milk are high in international comparison because of the inefficient Estonian dairy processors.&#13;
With the improvement of competition among milk processors, processing costs are expected to decrease&#13;
in the future. Cost savings in processing could translate into higher farmgate milk prices and consequently&#13;
increase the financial and economic rate of return of the described investments.&#13;
20.   Methodology. The economic analysis of the farm models uses the same prices and assumptions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 6 of 37&#13;
as in the financial farm model with one major change. The investment costs for drainage rehabilitation&#13;
and advisory services have been increased to reflect the full investment costs of these investments to the&#13;
economy and include both the farmers and the Government's proportion In the economic analysis costs&#13;
of fertilizer have been increased to reflect import parity prices at the farmgate.&#13;
21.    The with Project model shows a positive Net Present Value (NPV) of 30,874 and an economic&#13;
rate of return (ERR) of 16%. The ERR and NPV are lower than in the financial model reflecting the full&#13;
investment costs for drainage rehabilitation and agricultural advisory services to the economy.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
22.    Overall, the ERR is robust to significant changes in costs and benefits: benefits would need to fall&#13;
by 24% or costs increase by 31% for the ERR to fall to 10% (i.e. with a net present value of zero). If&#13;
the benefits are delayed by two years, the ERR would drop to 11%. If simultaneously incremental costs&#13;
increase by 20% and incremental benefits drop by 10%, the ERR would drop to 10%. In addition, a risk&#13;
analysis for key assumptions, including (i) inadequate rehabilitation and maintenance of the drainage&#13;
systems beyond the project period, (ii) shortfalls in projected yield or production increases, (iii) change&#13;
of key agricultural output prices is presented below.&#13;
23.   Inadequate rehabilitation and maintenance of the drainage system. Farmers would have to fully&#13;
finance the rehabilitation of the drainage system after about nine years to increase the life of the drainage&#13;
system to around 60 years. If farmers fail to rehabilitate the drainage system, and the incremental benefits&#13;
would drop to zero after year 10, then the ERR would drop to 10%. Therefore the Project has emphasized&#13;
that farmers are organized in Land and Water Associations (LWAs), and assume full responsibility for part&#13;
of the investment costs, and all maintenance as well as future rehabilitation costs. In addition, the benefits&#13;
of maintaining the drainage system are very high.&#13;
24.    Shortfalls in projected crop yield.  The model reacts sensitive to a shortfall in projected crop&#13;
yields. The viability of the livestock farms is jeopardized when crop and pasture yields cannot be&#13;
sustained at certain levels, a case when drainage systems are not rehabilitated and maintained. If crop&#13;
yields are 10% lower than assumed, the ERR of the economic farm model would fall to 10%. If yields&#13;
drop below the calculated level, the farm would then have to substitute the cheaper on-farm produced&#13;
forage crops with more expensive cereals purchased on the markets. The sensitivity analysis underlines&#13;
the importance of drainage rehabilitation being a pre-requisite to achieve and sustain the projected yields&#13;
for crops and pasture. If maintenance of the drainage system is neglected over several years, yields may&#13;
drop below the threshold yields resulting in cost of milk production that are higher than the current&#13;
farmgate milk price. However, the estimates of incremental crop yields and incremental milk production&#13;
are extremely conservative. For instance, barley yields have been projected to increase by only 0.6 t/ha&#13;
to around 2.2 t/ha (with Project). The yields used in the "with Project" scenario are comparable to average&#13;
Estonian barley yields that have fluctuated between 1.6 and 2.2 t/ha in the last two years whereas yields&#13;
on well drained soils are often higher than 3 t/ha.&#13;
25.   Change of key aericultural output prices. The model reacts less sensitive to changes of output&#13;
prices. If the milk price drops by 20%, the ERR would fall to 9%. However, a drop of the milk price&#13;
by 20% is unlikely, because the farmgate price is presently extremely low. Farmgate prices for milk are&#13;
likely to increase, because the processing costs of Estonian dairy processing plants are expected to decline&#13;
over the next years as the processors increase their productivity and reduce existing overcapacities.&#13;

C. ANALYSIS OF PROJECT BENEFITS BY COMPONENT&#13;
26.   The economic analysis provides a discussion of the Project benefits for each component.&#13;
However, as illustrated in the farm model analysis, many of the benefits of the component are interrelated&#13;
and can not be analyzed, or achieved, in isolation.&#13;
27.    Country and Agricultural Strategv. The Project follows the GOE's and the Bank's strategy to&#13;
transform the rural sector, through supporting private agricultural and rural initiatives, into an&#13;
economically viable and competitive market-based system. The agricultural strategy in the past and the&#13;
near future aims at maintaining an open competitive agricultural sector based on private ownership of land,&#13;
liberal agricultural trade policies, market determined agricultural prices, and limited budget transfers to&#13;
the agricultural and rural sector. The liberal agricultural policy of Estonia to date can be described as&#13;
exceptional within the former Soviet Union because prices and market distortions have been almost&#13;
completely avoided. The recently completed Agricultural Sector Review for Estonia notes that low wages,&#13;
low land costs, and the existing stock of skills and infrastructure provide Estonia with a competitive&#13;
potential, primarily in dairy and related livestock production. The strategy is therefore aimed at increasing&#13;
the efficiency and profitability of agriculture in Estonia and not primarily at increasing agricultural&#13;
production or exports. Poverty and environmental issues related to the Project are discussed in separate&#13;
sections in the SAR.4&#13;
28.   Public versus Private Sector Investment. Following the outlined strategy, the Project selectively&#13;
provides investments to improve existing key infrastructure in target areas (farm drainage rehabilitation),&#13;
strengthen the public and support the development of a private advisory services, and enhance food quality&#13;
control functions. The Project focuses on investments that initiate a gradual transfer of Govemment&#13;
functions to the private sector (advisory services, drainage maintenance), or improve core Government&#13;
functions (food quality control, public advisory services, environmental controls in agriculture).&#13;
Land Reform&#13;
29.    Benefits. The Project would support the development of a rural land market by accelerating the&#13;
registration of rural land in the cadastre and title book. These measures would (i) facilitate the access&#13;
of farmers to long-term credit because commercial banks would be more inclined to accept land with a&#13;
secure, transferable and mortgageable title as collateral, and (ii) increase the movement of the production&#13;
factor land through sale or lease to efficient agricultural producers, thereby increasing agricultural&#13;
production and incomes.&#13;
30.    Land with a secure and registered title could be used as an immoveable and mortgageable&#13;
collateral to obtain a long-term loan from a commercial bank. Experience shows that long-term mortgage&#13;
interest rates are generally lower than long-term interest rates for other loans not using "immoveable" land&#13;
or buildings as collateral. At present, it is difficult to obtain long-term loans as the vast majority of all&#13;
loans are for a maturity of less than 3 years. In addition, commercial banks in Estonia consider any land&#13;
or building without a registration in the title book as moveable collateral and subsequently charge long-&#13;
term interest rates of about 20 - 25%. It can be assumed that a mortgage banking system would provide&#13;
farmers with access to long-term loan funds with lower than present interest rates. Mortgage banking is&#13;
only in the initial stages of development but it is likely that it would develop rapidly, if land and buildings&#13;

are registered in the cadastre and title book.&#13;
31.    Cost Effectiveness Analysis. The benefits of land surveys and title registration could be assessed&#13;
as the difference between the interest rate for a long-term mortgage loan which is typically lower than the&#13;
interest rate of a loan of the same maturity for a different purpose. A simple cost-effectiveness analysis&#13;
shows that a reduction of the interest rate for a loan of EEK 100,000 (10 years maturity, no grace period,&#13;
constant principal repayment) by about 2% would be sufficient to cover the estimated costs of EEK-9,600&#13;
for land surveys of an average farm of about 25 ha. Experience in developed economies demonstrates&#13;
that the differential in interest rates for long-term loans between mortgage loans and other loans is&#13;
substantially larger than 2%. The Project would therefore have substantial financial and economic benefits&#13;
for the economy by supporting the development of mortgage banking. This analysis is based on the&#13;
assumptions outlined in Table 2.&#13;

32.    Cost Recovery. The GOE plans to recover the costs for the land surveys from the property&#13;
owners. The GOE is developing incentives for owners to finance the land survey and to register their land&#13;
in the cadastre and title book. The land surveys would be conducted by around 200 private surveying&#13;
companies operating in Estonia.&#13;
Farm Drainage Rehabilitation&#13;
33.    Back2round.  Artificially drained farmland has been an important feature of the Estonian&#13;
agriculture, representing some 739,000 ha or 66% of the 1.12 million of amble land. Natural conditions&#13;
for agriculture are far from optimal, primarily due to the short growing season and the generally poor soil&#13;
fertility. The height of the growing season coincides with the period of highest rainfall. Although&#13;
precipitation is fairly uniform between 570 and 720 mm/year, 65% of this rainfall occurs during the 5-&#13;
5      At present, there is no land market so that the land value is assumed at 1/6 of the average price of&#13;
agricultural land in the US.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

month period from May to September with peaks in July and August. Plant growth and harvesting on&#13;
lands that have inadequate natural drainage are adversely affected by these conditions.  The growing&#13;
season on well drained fields is increased by about a month which results in earlier planting and&#13;
subsequent higher yields.&#13;
34.    The poor soil conditions and the short growing season are the major cause of the relatively low&#13;
crop yields in Estonia. Rehabilitation and good maintenance of drainage systems are key to the increase&#13;
the productivity of dairy farms. The farm improvements (reduction of livestock feed production costs and&#13;
increase in herd outputs) described in the farm model analysis hinge on changes in land use, cropping&#13;
patterns, improvement in pasture and livestock management, as well as introduction of improved grass and&#13;
legume species in pastures. Higher yields depend on a grassland technology utilizing nitrogen fixing&#13;
rhizobium activities of legumes. However, excessive soil moisture and poor soil aeration would inhibit&#13;
the growth of the high yielding legumes and consequently lead to nitrogen deficient pastures which would&#13;
naturally be overgrown with less productive grass and weeds.&#13;
35.    Routine maintenance of farm drainage systems has been reduced substantially since 1989 and has&#13;
eroded land productivity over time. Without regular maintenance and periodic rehabilitation, drainage&#13;
efficiency and consequently crop yields will continue to decline. If crop yields cannot be sustained above&#13;
the described yield threshold that guarantees positive returns, crop lands would be forced out of&#13;
production. Moreover, if maintenance is deferred too long, these drainage systems can no longer be&#13;
maintained or rehabilitated, and reconstruction would be prohibitive in costs and economically&#13;
questionable.&#13;
36.    Drainage Rehabilitation Investments. The Project therefore plans to rehabilitate about 60,000 ha&#13;
of the most fertile drained agricultural land in about 60 separate locations. Areas for drainage&#13;
rehabilitation works will be selected according to site selection criteria that include: (a) environmental&#13;
screening; (b) soil fertility;6 (c) land use intensity; (d) condition of the drainage systems; (e) technical&#13;
feasibility and designs; (f) investment cost ceiling; (g) status of land tenure; (h) farner's participation&#13;
including various pre-conditions for local LWAs; and (i) location of markets.&#13;
37.    Rehabilitation investments, including design and supervision, have been limited to expenditures&#13;
of not more than EEK 1,500 per ha (in 1995 financial terms). This limitation ensures that rehabilitation&#13;
investments are targeted to areas with low rehabilitation costs. In the future, routine maintenance and&#13;
punctual rehabilitation will be required to sustain the expected benefits from drainage rehabilitation&#13;
investments. While routine maintenance of the systems is required annually, punctual rehabilitation of&#13;
the main and collector drains, and repair of the subsurface drain outlets should be carried out every nine&#13;
to twelve years, in order to increase the life of the drainage system to 60 years.&#13;
38.    Large areas of substandard drained agricultural land will continue to be forced out of production&#13;
because it is no longer financially viable to maintain these systems. Current estimates show that without&#13;
any intervention about 144,000 ha' of drainage systems would permanently be forced out production, as&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation programs fall behind schedule and reconstruction proves to be financially&#13;
6 Drainage systems should have soils of good quality (e.g. more than 40 soil points).&#13;

inviable. Without the project, the area of adequately drained land is expected to decline from 591,000&#13;
-ha in 1994 to 447,000 ha in 1997. In addition, the contraction in livestock population, as caused by the&#13;
collapse of the Soviet markets and increasing trade barriers imposed by Russia, had accelerated the rate&#13;
at which substandard lands were forced out of production. Consequently, the expected loss in livestock&#13;
feed production would outweigh the incremental increases in crop production from the Project. The&#13;
incremental feed production from the Project, if translated into livestock production, corresponds to about&#13;
2% of Estonia's total milk production and less than 1% of the beef production in 1993.&#13;
39.   By rehabilitating only those parts of the drainage system that have the highest potential for&#13;
agricultural production, the drainage investments would intensify and increase the efficiency of livestock&#13;
fodder production and improve the competitiveness of livestock and dairy farms in the Project areas. It&#13;
can therefore be assumed that a small part of the reduction of agricultural lands can be attributed to the&#13;
intensification of the production in the Project area.&#13;
40.   Cost Recovery. GOE plans to privatize the ownership, operations, and maintenance of all farm&#13;
drainage systems by handing over these systems to LWAs after completion of the drainage rehabilitation&#13;
works. Responsibilities of LWAs are specified in the Amelioration Law (May 1994) and membership is&#13;
compulsory for farmers in the drainage area. GOE has determined that each LWA must agree to&#13;
contribute (in cash or in kind) 20% of the cost of the rehabilitation works, the remaining 80% would be&#13;
covered by GOE with budget and Project loan funds. In return, GOE would, post-rehabilitation, no longer&#13;
accept any further financial responsibility for these on-farm drainage systems. The cost sharing formula&#13;
is a legal decision by GOE based on a rough analysis of what farmers' are prepared to contribute in labor&#13;
towards the rehabilitation of the drainage system. Each LWA will have full ownership of its area-specific&#13;
drainage system and bear full O&amp;M costs. The LWAs are expected to finance a second round&#13;
rehabilitation of the drainage systems after 9 - 12 years. Future GOE expenditures for drainage system&#13;
maintenance would be reduced by more than the actual contribution to the rehabilitation costs. However,&#13;
the ABs will continue to be responsible for operations and maintenance of rivers and main canals outside&#13;
the drainage areas, as the main canals often serve other users such as industries and municipalities. Cost&#13;
recovery options for maintenance of rivers and main canals are being considered, including the possibility&#13;
of: (a) direct charges to landowners; and (b) transferring the financial responsibility of this maintenance&#13;
to the respective municipalities which would then recover these costs through local taxes.&#13;
41.   Crop Response to Drainage. Rehabilitation and good maintenance of drainage systems in the&#13;
project area are expected to increase the growing season by one month, thereby contributing to incremental&#13;
yields of 0.6 ton/ha for cereals (primarily barley, oats and rye), 0.9 ton/ha in hay equivalent for grassland,&#13;
and 4 ton/ha for potato. These yield increments are considered conservative, and based on the actual&#13;
difference between crop yields on lands with good drainage and yields on poorly drained lands. The&#13;
cropping pattern in the project area is estimated to consist of 30% cereals, 65% pasture for silage and hay,&#13;
and 5% potato on average. Most of the cereal production in Estonia is used for livestock feed and hay&#13;
is a major input for dairy production.&#13;
42.   Benefits. At full development, incremental production of feed grains in the project area of 60,000&#13;
ha (Base Case can be expected to reach 10,800 tons of feed grains, 35,100 tons of hay and 12,000 tons&#13;
of potato per year. The incremental crop production, when translated into dry matter (about 31,600 tons)&#13;
and nutritional values, is equivalent to the amount of feed required for producing 15 million liters of milk&#13;
and 500 tons of beef (carcass weight). These equivalents in milk and meat production would represent&#13;
2% of the country's total milk production in 1993 of 750,000 tons and less than 1% of the beef production&#13;
in 1993 of 115,000 tons (carcass weight). In addition, the organization of farmers in LWAs and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 11 of 37&#13;
involvement of the farmers in the design of the drainage system could also result in new community&#13;
services provided by these LWAs, such as input supplies, machinery pools, marketing and possibly credit.&#13;
The drainage rehabilitation investments would directly benefit small local contractors carrying out the civil&#13;
works and would also stimulate the development of other rural support services to agriculture in the rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
43.    An Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the farm drainage component has been calculated&#13;
separately. The ERR for the farn drainage component is estimated at 23% and the net present value&#13;
(NPV) of the projected net benefits amounts to EEK 26 million. The analysis is based on the economic&#13;
costs for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the drainage system over 15 years and includes the system&#13;
design, works supervision, and LWA establishment costs as well as a second rehabilitation after 9 - 12&#13;
years. Drainage system efficiency has been conservatively estimated at 90%. The incremental benefits&#13;
are valued in terms of incremental production of hay, feed grains and potatoes. The benefits of&#13;
rehabilitating the existing system are high due to substantial yield increases triggered by relatively minor&#13;
costs for repairs and flushing of the system.&#13;
44.   However, even though the incremental production of feed grain, hay and potatoes could be valued&#13;
at market prices, the majority of the incremental production are only intermediate goods used for livestock&#13;
production. As shown in the farm model analysis, the farm drainage rehabilitation investments are a&#13;
prerequisite for complementary farm improvement investments aimed at increasing herd size, farm&#13;
production, and farm income. The combined ERR of investments in drainage rehabilitation, agricultural&#13;
advisory services and privately financed complementary investments is consequently lower than only&#13;
looking at farm drainage rehabilitation separately. The farm model analysis therefore provides a realistic&#13;
approximation of Project benefits for the drainage rehabilitation and agricultural advisory services&#13;
components.&#13;
Agricultural Advisory Services&#13;
45.   Benefits. Extension plays a key role in the dissemination of information on new technologies, or&#13;
improved organizational and management practices. Research results have confirmed that extension's&#13;
impact on agriculture showed "a significant and positive external effect" in 33 analyzed cases. A&#13;
calculation of net economic rates of return in eight studies shows highly positive results in eight cases,&#13;
ranging from 14% to nearly 500% (Birkhaeuser, Evenson, and Feder, 1988).&#13;
46.   Extension will likely have a substantial impact on the transformation of the Estonian farming&#13;
sector to a market oriented production system. However, the impact of extension during the transition&#13;
period is extremely difficult to quantify in isolation, due to the paucity of data, the lack of experience with&#13;
similar situations, and in many cases the necessity to complement the advice with actual on-farm&#13;
investments. Three sets of benefits can be expected: (a) benefits related to agricultural production; (b)&#13;
environmental benefits; and (c) societal benefits.&#13;
47.   Benefits related to (a) agricultural production in Estonia can be expected especially through&#13;
increased production (higher yields), improved product quality (higher milk quality), and improved on-&#13;
farm processing (improved storage of livestock feed). In addition, extension can help to reduce production&#13;
costs through new technologies but also through promoting cooperation between farmers to jointly use&#13;
farm machinery. (b) Environmental benefits can be expected through the promotion of improved and safe&#13;
storage and application of manure, enhancement of soil fertility and reduction of agricultural run-off&#13;
through drainage. Especially in the drainage rehabilitation area, extension service will play an important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 12 of 37&#13;
role in providing information of reducing potential negative impacts of drainage rehabilitation.  (c)&#13;
Societal benefits can be expected through provision of advice on alternative employment opportunities in&#13;
the rural areas, easing the transition out of agriculture, but also reducing the amount of out-migration from&#13;
rural areas. Evidence from a donor-financed extension project suggests that already minor improvements&#13;
of the maintenance of the milking equipment result in drastic quality improvements. These quality&#13;
improvements result in substantial benefits for the farmers because of the large difference in payment for&#13;
low quality and high quality milk.&#13;
48.   Public versus private advisory services. The Project assists the establishment of a new advisory&#13;
system in Estonia consisting of a public and a private extension service. This requires a redefinition of&#13;
the Government's role in extension. The development of a public and private advisory service is based&#13;
on a distinction between advice that has public good characteristics and advice that is a private good. The&#13;
rationale is that the public sector will continue to pay for, but not necessarily implement, extension in&#13;
some areas, but that the farmers will be expected to pay for advice that benefits them directly.  In&#13;
addition, some farmer's will have to leave agriculture, and information on alternative income provided&#13;
by the public advisory service can speed up that process, thereby enhancing the profitability of the&#13;
remaining farmers.&#13;
49.   Cost recovery. The proposed support for Estonian advisory services is important, but limited, both&#13;
in time and in scope. The Private Advisory Services Development Fund requires only an initial&#13;
investment, because the farmers are expected to take over those programs over time. The fund will give&#13;
non-transferable grants to farmers to pay for part of the advisory services of private advisors. Over an&#13;
eight year period the Government contribution to the private advisory service will be gradually phased out.&#13;
In addition, the Government will continue to fund a small public extension service, administered by the&#13;
Farmer's Union, and equally supported under the Project. The public extension service will provide more&#13;
technical advice of a general nature. The development of the private agricultural advisory services will&#13;
reduce the number of county-level field staff (from 6-7 per county to about 3-4) employed by the&#13;
Government. The Government will therefore reduce its active involvement in extension to a more strategic&#13;
and supervisory role. This will over time substantially reduce GOE's recurrent expenditures&#13;

50.    Benefits. The Project would improve one laboratory of the State Veterinary Department to&#13;
improve health and quality standards in order to protect domestic and foreign consumers, and increase&#13;
export potential of agricultural products. The Project investments are aimed at enhancing and monitoring&#13;
the quality of food and livestock products in accordance with EU regulations. If Estonian livestock&#13;
products meet EU standards, the tariffs for selected livestock exports to the EU would be reduced by 60%&#13;
(US $5 - 6 million over the next three years). These investments, in the order of US $1.2 million, would&#13;
initiate production quality improvements at the farm level and in the food processing industries. However,&#13;
private sector investments in production facilities at the farm level and at the agro-processing level would&#13;
have to complement the Project investments to increase the quality of food and livestock products.&#13;
51.    Public versus Private Investment and Cost Recovery. The Project supports the initial phase of a&#13;
broader program to improve Estonia's food quality at the production, processing and marketing level. Part&#13;
of the future control functions would be undertaken by private laboratories, but some of these functions&#13;
would remain in Government hands. It is expected that the Veterinary Laboratory would charge for the&#13;
tests to partially recover costs.&#13;

52.    This component is aimed at strengthening environmental controls in agriculture. It consists of a&#13;
wetlands management strategy plan to develop a national strategy for wetlands development and&#13;
protection. In addition, the Ministry of Environment receives considerable support to develop and enforce&#13;
environmental regulations and monitor the impact of the drainage rehabilitation investments on the&#13;
environment.   To analyze the impact of future drainage investments, the Project supports a sectoral&#13;
environmental drainage study which analyzes the future options for drained lands.&#13;
53.    The agricultural strategy of the Government is aimed at increasing the profitability of the farming&#13;
sector through intensification of the production. Present and future yield and input levels of agricultural&#13;
production are and will likely be low compared to European agriculture because of the short summers&#13;
which do not allow extremely intensive production. The Ministry of Environment actively participates&#13;
in developing the framework for future agricultural production at an early stage to ensure adequate&#13;
environmental controls and the development of an environmentally sustainable agriculture in Estonia. This&#13;
is especially important for the drainage rehabilitation investments financed by the Project.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
ESTONIA&#13;
AGRICULTURE PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.           Introduction. The proposed loan to the agricultural sector in Estonia has been developed&#13;
to support economic transformation in rural areas. The loan package includes investments in land reform,&#13;
farm drainage rehabilitation, land management studies, agricultural extension and food quality control&#13;
laboratory. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) describes the proposed project framework, objectives, and&#13;
component in detail while this annex focuses specifically on the environmental review process, mitigation&#13;
and monitoring proposed for the project. A draft overview of environmental issues in Estonia is being&#13;
prepared by the World Bank. In addition, the World Bank is preparing a "Biodiversity Strategy" which&#13;
is financed through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF).&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
2.           Estonian Environmental Strategy. The cornerstone of Estonian environmental policy is&#13;
sustainable development which considers the basic needs of the present and the future. Estonian&#13;
environmental policy encourages a shift from previous production based actions to use of an ecologically&#13;
based systemic approach to balance human needs with ecologically sustainable practices (Keskkond, 1993).&#13;
The proposed Agriculture Project must be consistent with Estonian enviromnental goals by including&#13;
concerns for the sustainable use of natural resources into plans for development and restructuring of the&#13;
rural sector. This environmental review is a mechanism to assure that all relevant environmental&#13;
concerns are addressed in the project plans, recommended mitigation, and the project monitoring&#13;
program.&#13;
3.           Regulatory Framework. Estonia Governmental Regulation No. 314, adopted in November&#13;
1992, describes procedures for Environmental Impact Assessment. Under the Estonian system, a project&#13;
may be categorized as a project of State Importance, Regional Importance, or one which does not require&#13;
an environmental assessment. Projects of state importance are typically larger in scale with potential&#13;
impacts crossing county borders. Environmental assessments and reviews for state importance projects&#13;
are conducted by the Ministry of the Environment. Projects of regional importance are typically smaller&#13;
in size, located within the boundaries of a particular county, and environmental reviews and assessments&#13;
are conducted at the County Environmental Departments.&#13;
4.           Environmental review is required for all World Bank loans and credits as described in&#13;
the World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment."  The purpose of the&#13;
environmental review process is:&#13;
"to ensure that development options under consideration are environmentally sound and&#13;
sustainable and that any environmental consequences are recognized early and taken into&#13;
consideration in project design."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project: Environmental Review                             ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
5.           The World Bank's environmental review procedures require the classification of projects&#13;
into one of three categories (A,B,C) that consider the nature, magnitude, and sensitivity of environmental&#13;
issues. Classification of a project is achieved through a screening process beginning at initial project&#13;
identification and continuing through project appraisal as more information becomes available. A detailed&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA) document is normally required for category A projects that have&#13;
potentially diverse and significant environmental impacts. Category B projects undergo a more limited&#13;
environmental analysis since the potential environmental impacts are less severe. A project would be&#13;
classified into category C during environmental screening if it had minimal to no environmental impacts.&#13;
6.           Environmental Screening. Table 1 (to this annex) presents results of environmental&#13;
screening by the Estonian Ministry of the Environment and the World Bank for the Project. World Bank&#13;
guidelines recommend that the most stringent classification of any individual project component shall&#13;
determine the overall project classification. Both World Bank and Estonian environmental review&#13;
procedures were used to classify project components. The Farm Drainage Rehabilitation project&#13;
component has been classified as category B under the World Bank guidelines. This component will&#13;
require further screening for specific investments during the course of project implementation. Therefore,&#13;
the environmental review focuses on the proposed screening and impact analysis process.&#13;
7.           Environmental screening under the Estonian Environmental Impact guidelines classifies&#13;
the Wetlands Management Strategy Plan as of state importance. This study is considered strategically&#13;
important to Estonia and thus would benefit from public participation and full consideration of&#13;
environmental issues early in the planning process. All other project components were classified under&#13;
World Bank guidelines as category C, or under Estonian guidelines as not requiring an environmental&#13;
assessment or review. It is recognized, however that actions taken based on technical assistance, studies,&#13;
and strategies may have environmental impacts and quite often involve issues with a direct influence on&#13;
the environment.  The World Bank encourages and supports the Estonian decision to conduct&#13;
environmental assessments on technical assistance, studies, and strategies of regional or state importance.&#13;
Environmental reviews performed early in the process reduce the need for more detailed reviews further&#13;
downstream and provide a much better framework for future planning decisions.&#13;
8.           Consultation Process. The Project is being designed in collaboration with the Ministry&#13;
of Environment which is one of the implementing agencies besides the Ministry of Agriculture and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The Environmental Assessment Division of the Ministry of the Environment is&#13;
responsible for oversight of the preparation of the environmental review activities of the Project. The&#13;
Water Department of the Ministry of Environment is responsible for all environmental regulations and&#13;
screening procedures regarding the farm drainage rehabilitation component.  A number of non-&#13;
governmental organizations have been consulted during the Project preparation process, especially&#13;
regarding the farm drainage rehabilitation and the rural finance component. Mission members met with&#13;
the Stockholm Environment Institute - Tallinn which has been contracted to prepare supplementary&#13;
information and a training course on the environmental screening criteria for commercial banks using the&#13;
World Bank Refinancing Facility. Representatives of the Estonia Fund for Nature (Westonia Project)&#13;
have provided written comments during preparation which are included in the background working&#13;
papers. In addition, mission members met with the Estonian Farmers Union, staff of the University of&#13;
Tartu, and the Estonia Academy of Sciences, Institute of Technology. Representatives of the Matsalu&#13;
State Nature Reserve have been consulted concerning the design of the environmental screening criteria&#13;
for farm drainage rehabilitation in the catchment area of the Reserve, given the ecological importance of&#13;
this area.&#13;
&#13;

FARM DRAINAGE REHABILITATION&#13;
9.           Farm drainage rehabilitation investments. Investments are proposed to rehabilitate and&#13;
maintain selected drainage channels and supporting infrastructure in critical farming areas to prevent&#13;
permanent damage to existing farm drainage systems. Maintenance of fann drainage infrastructure has&#13;
been neglected during the previous years due to a lack of funding resulting in clogging of subsurface&#13;
pipes and reduction in channel conveyance capacity. Investments under this loan are very limited, and&#13;
will be selected using evaluation criteria to maximize improvements to the most productive agricultural&#13;
lands and to minimize environmental damage. Land amelioration (new drainage) will be limited to&#13;
rehabilitation of existing works and will not involve investments in new drainage schemes, nor include&#13;
polders where submerged lands are now drained for agricultural purposes, or support the drainage of&#13;
"wet forests ".&#13;
10.         Proposed drainage investments during the investment period include 200 kilometers (km)&#13;
of rehabilitation and 1250 km of maintenance of the main drainage channels; 1500 km of rehabilitation&#13;
and 3400 km of maintenance of collector (secondary) drainage channels; and pipe cleanout (flushing&#13;
sediment) at approximately 15,000 outlets in both main and collector drainage channels during&#13;
rehabilitation. Drainage investments are estimated to support approximately 60,000 hectares of land.&#13;
Environmental reviews will be conducted, if necessary, following Estonian and World Bank procedures.&#13;
However, drainage investment site selection with use agreed screening criteria to minimize potential&#13;
damage to the environment. Consultations have been undertaken in preparation of the proposed&#13;
Project with representatives of the Matsalu State Nature Reserve to review their views on potential&#13;
activities in this catchment area.&#13;
11.          Environmental screening and monitoring. The Ministry of Enviromnent has devised a&#13;
two step approach to ensure that the drainage rehabilitation investments will be undertaken in a way to&#13;
ensure minimal potential damage to the environment and public concerns are'adequately addressed. The&#13;
environmental screening and monitoring procedures are based on the Water Law (adopted May 1994) that&#13;
regulates water protection matters, and the Law on Environmental Protection of Shores and Banks&#13;
(adopted in 1995) that regulates environmental protective measures for natural streams and drains. The&#13;
two step environmental screening approach consists of: (a) environmental screening during site selection&#13;
and (b) environmental guidelines for the design of drainage rehabilitation schemes:&#13;
12.          Environmental screening during the site selection phase&#13;
Screening criteria will be used to exclude certain areas as potential project sites to&#13;
minimize environmental damage.  These have been drafted by MOE, Dept. of&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment. This includes: (a) work will not be performed in&#13;
areas where fish and wildlife habitat is protected by Estonian environmental laws or&#13;
rules; (b) wetlands and estuaries with important wildlife or fishery values will be avoided;&#13;
(c) important native grasslands or forest lands of special significance will be avoided; (d)&#13;
national forest lands will be avoided until a forestry strategy is completed; and (e) polders&#13;
will be avoided until special site-specific environmental studies have been prepared.&#13;
Each site proposed by the Amelioration Units will be assessed by a local environmental&#13;
consultant (financed through project funds) who prepares an EIA report. This report will&#13;
be reviewed by the County Environment Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Estonia Agriculture Project: Environmental Review                                 ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
-      Water quality of the proposed drainage sites will be analyzed' to determine limits for&#13;
nutrient effluent in the drain water after rehabilitation.&#13;
-      The local Anelioration Bureau and the County Enviromnent Department would then&#13;
inform the public of the proposed project rehabilitation site and give the public (incl.&#13;
NGO's) a possibility to comment on the suitability of the proposed site for drainage&#13;
rehabilitation .&#13;
-      The County Environment Department then decides if the site is acceptable for drainage&#13;
rehabilitation and makes a recommendation to MOE and MOA.&#13;
-      In the case of highly sensitive areas (for example the catchment area of the Matsalu State&#13;
Nature Reserve) a final decision will be taken by MOE.&#13;
13.          Environmental screening during the design phase.&#13;
-      Environmental Guidelines for design of drainage rehabilitation works will be issued by&#13;
MOE. They cover: size of drainage units, regulations for dredging and straightening of&#13;
inlets, use of buffer areas or water protection belts, construction of sedimentation ponds,&#13;
and, in certain cases, long-term use of agricultural inputs.&#13;
-      'County Environment Departments will receive design plans for drainage rehabilitation&#13;
for approval and make recommendations on necessary mitigation measures. In critical&#13;
cases final r ecommendations will be issued by MOE.&#13;
14.          Different and stricter guidelines are proposed for all areas that are under enviromnental&#13;
protection, which includes ecologically sensitive areas like the catchment area of the Matsalu State Nature&#13;
Reserve. The screening criteria listed above are intentionally stringent to minimize investments in project&#13;
sites that require detailed environmental reviews during the early project stages.&#13;
15.          Maintenance of open drain channels will be carried out using techniques to minimize&#13;
environmental damages such as: (i) limiting excavation to design cross-sectional lines when channel&#13;
cleanouts are carried out; (ii) having equipment work from one side of the channel whenever possible;&#13;
(iii) consideration of sediment control by minimizing damage to vegetation on channel side slopes when&#13;
possible, and (iv) installing sediment traps when needed.&#13;
16.          Major Findings.  Potential environmental impacts from drainage rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance include increased sedimentation, loss of critical wetland areas, groundwater table impacts,&#13;
loss of wildlife habitats, and downstream impacts to sensitive or protected environments. Mitigation&#13;
measures to minimize or prevent these impacts are available and shall be included in the project design.&#13;
Some areas of Estonia have large beaver populations that have historically caused damage to drainage&#13;
infrastructure. Mitigation against beaver damage may be required for proposed investments near large&#13;
beaver populations.&#13;
Laboratory equipment will be purchased by MOE using Project funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 5 of 8&#13;
17.          Proposed Mitigation Plan. The outlined environmental criteria for drainage rehabilitation&#13;
will ensure minimal potential damage to the environment and apply to all future drainage rehabilitation&#13;
works (above a certain minimum size). e.g., not only to the project financed rehabilitation works. MOE&#13;
plans to issue the environmental guidelines and the consultation process as a Ministerial Decree or a&#13;
Governmental Decree. Mitigation measures included in the overall project design are the use of initial&#13;
environmental screening criteria for investment site selection; and recommended environmentally sensitive&#13;
practices for implementation of drainage improvements. Site specific mitigation measures for investments&#13;
will be approved by the Ministry of the Environment county or state environmental impact assessment&#13;
staff on a case-by-case basis. Proposed technical assistance for environmental studies and drainage&#13;
research and curriculum revisions will provide a complementary infornation source for the development&#13;
and recommendation of mitigation measures. Research and studies would emphasize adaptive and applied&#13;
field methods to reduce maintenance costs, improve the sustainability of drainage systems, and promote&#13;
environmental protection.&#13;
18.          All proposed drainage investments shall be consistent with local land use management&#13;
plans. The Estonian Act on Land Cadastre passed in October, 1994 and effective January, 1995 describes&#13;
procedures for updating and establishing land use management plans. Revised land use management plans&#13;
should consider the importance of the environment, economic changes in the municipality, and desirable&#13;
social and economic projections&#13;
19.          Environmental Monitoring Plan. World Bank monitoring of the drainage investments&#13;
would be performed during regularly scheduled supervision missions. The Ministry of the Environment&#13;
would screen each proposed drainage investment plan receiving funding under this loan for environmental&#13;
impact assessment requirements. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would maintain records of each&#13;
letter from the Ministry of the Environment granting clearance of site specific investments. Proposed&#13;
investments that require an environmental assessment under the Estonian guidelines would be reviewed&#13;
by World Bank environmental staff for consistency and compliance with World Bank procedures.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS&#13;
20.          Environmental Benefits. Environmental benefits will be provided by several technical&#13;
assistance project components. A reorientation of drainage research and educational curriculum will&#13;
emphasize adaptive and field methods to reduce maintenance costs, improve sustainability of drainage&#13;
systems, and promote environmental protection. Environmental studies targeted at drainage investments&#13;
during the loan period and the future will assure that investments are made in an environmentally&#13;
sensitive manner. The agricultural training and field extension services provide an opportunity to&#13;
establish more sustainable farming practices than have been used in the past. Extension services would&#13;
also address environmental concerns related to farming practices through input provided by local county&#13;
environmental staff.&#13;
21.          The Wetlands Management Strategy Plan will provide a framework for future&#13;
management of these natural resources in a sustainable manner. The proposed Wetlands Management&#13;
Strategy Plan would complement the ongoing "Wetstonia Project" and develop a system for valuing&#13;
wetlands considering physical, hydrological, and biological criteria, as well as conservation and&#13;
development goals. The strategy will provide guidelines and a framework for rehabilitation of peat-mined&#13;
areas and wetland restoration projects.&#13;

CONCLUSION&#13;
22.          Conclusion. No major significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated from&#13;
this project. The component that was classified as category B and will require additional environmental&#13;
screening for specific investments as they are proposed during the investment period. Therefore, this&#13;
environrental review has focused on the procedures in place to ensure that investments are&#13;
environmentally sound and sustainable. The project will be regularly monitored for environmental issues&#13;
by the Ministry of Environment. The World Bank will be kept informed by MOE of any drainage&#13;
investments that require environmental assessments and will review environmental documentation by the&#13;
PIU on supervision missions.&#13;

Major Environmental Issues; (describes rajor environmental issues identified or suspected in project)&#13;
(i) Potential impacts from drainage rehabilitation and maintenance activities such as increased sedimentation, loss of wetland areas,&#13;
groundwater table impacts, loss of wildlife habitats, and downstream impacts to sensitive environments; (ii) the Wetland&#13;
Management Strategy is of strategic importance to Estonia on a national level and therefore public participation is needed to assure&#13;
that environmental issues are g:--n approprint&gt; -onsideration.&#13;
Other Env&amp;tonmentaf Issues: (describes environmental issues of lesser scope associated with project)&#13;
Training of extension workers will be used to promote environmentally sustainable farming practices.&#13;
Proposed Actions: (describes actions proposed to mitigate environmental issues described in project)&#13;
An environmental review was prepared for the proposed project consistent with the environmental review procedures of Estonia and&#13;
the Bank. (i) Mitigation recommended for drainage investments included the use of environmental screening criteria for investment&#13;
site selection, and recormended environmentally sensitive practices for implementation of drainage improvements. Mitigation&#13;
measures for drainage maintenance investments have been recommended and will be included in the project designs. The Ministry&#13;
of Environment, Environmental Impact Assessment and Normatives Department would approve the environmental screening and&#13;
review of each proposed investnent. An Environmental Impact Assessment of a pilot site has been completed and would be used as&#13;
an example for future ElAs. The Project will not fund new drainage improvements or actions to drain 'wet forests". (ii) The&#13;
Wetlands Management Strategy will undergo an environmental review in accordance with Estonian EIA regulations.&#13;
Jusdficadon/Raonal for Environmental Category: (reasons for environnmental categury selected &amp; explanation of any changes from initial clasification)&#13;
Representatives from the Ministry of the Environment and Bank screened individual project subcomponents for environmental review&#13;
requirements under Estonian and Bank guidelines. The Wetlands Management Strategy was classified as of State Importance under&#13;
the Estonian EIA regulations. This subcomponent was identified as strategic importance to Estonia on a national level, and involves&#13;
decision-making concerning environmental issues. An Estonian EIA would be used as a mechanism for public input and assurance&#13;
that environmental issues are given appropriate consideration. The farm drainage rehabilitation component was classified as category&#13;
'B" under Bank guidelines because implementation of this component has the potential for environmental impacts if appropriate&#13;
controls or mitigation are not included in the project design. Each drainage rehabilitation investment proposal submitted for financing&#13;
would undergo environmental screening under the Estonian EIA regulations as project proposals are received.&#13;

agencies in the preparation of project component budgets. Perform&#13;
financial monitoring of project activities, and present financial analysis as&#13;
required of the PIU.&#13;
C.   Timing&#13;
Part-dime professional services from international and local consultants will be required&#13;
for a period of about 6 person-months spread over the first two years of the project. It&#13;
is expected that the project staff in the Project Implementation Unit and line&#13;
implementing agencies will be able to handle the operations of the project accounts&#13;
without further assistance, commencing from the third year of the project. The Project&#13;
Accountant's position is for a duration of 5 years.&#13;
Professional Services: Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist&#13;
A.   Tasks&#13;
As part of the Project Implementation Unit and reporting to the PIU Project Manager,&#13;
the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Specialist is required to:&#13;
(a)   Work with the Amelioration Unit and Amelioration Bureaux, and assist them in&#13;
site selection of drainage systems for rehabilitation, by reviewing the economic&#13;
selection criteria used for specific sites. Several factors to be considered include&#13;
the following:&#13;
the average cost of rehabilitation, including design, civil works and supervision.&#13;
Severely damaged systems and areas, requiring more than rehabilitation, must be&#13;
excluded as reconstruction costs are prohibitive and economically questionable.&#13;
The profitability of farm operations on the proposed sites, and the potential gains&#13;
that can be attributed to drainage improvement. This potential may include among&#13;
other things: (i) changes to cropping patterns and intensity; (ii) potential&#13;
introduction of new technology (such as grassland with legumes); (iii) the&#13;
possibility of early planting and delaying harvest time - lengthening growing&#13;
season by improving drainage conditions during critical periods; and (iv) crop&#13;
yield improvement and expected yields that can surpass profitable yield&#13;
thresholds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 11 of 13&#13;
(b)   Work with the Land Board and the Amelioration Unit, and ensure that priorities&#13;
for cadastral land surveys and registration include the proposed drainage sites,&#13;
and that timing for these surveys is suitably planned to clarify land tenure issues&#13;
in the context of LWA development.&#13;
(c)   Work closely with the Amelioration Unit and the Task Force of the Agriculture&#13;
Advisory Services, and ensure that LWAs of the proposed drainage sites receive&#13;
adequate attention in the targeting of extension and advisory services. Demand&#13;
for advisory services among these LWAs will be assessed and responded to.&#13;
(d)   Together with the respective implementing agencies, based on the Project&#13;
Implementation Plans develop a monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system for&#13;
each project component, incorporating indicators for measuring project inputs,&#13;
outputs, impacts (micro and macro) and the means for verifying and measuring&#13;
these indicators.&#13;
(e)   Periodically, monitor and evaluate progress of implementation of all project&#13;
components, provide concise notes on possible measures for overcoming major&#13;
issues that constrain project implementation, for the attention of the PIU Manager&#13;
and the respective implementing agencies.&#13;
(f)   Identify bottlenecks and systemic problems in implementation, and review these&#13;
conditions jointly with the relevant agencies to come up with measures and&#13;
options for solving these problems. Alert the PIU Project Manager of major&#13;
problems that require the attention of the Inter-Ministerial Project Steering&#13;
Committee and/or the Joint Project Directors at MOA and MOE.&#13;
(g)   Assist all implementing agencies, on financial, cost and economic analyses related&#13;
to their project components; and when appropriate also involve the Procurement&#13;
Specialist and the Project Accountant of the PIU in the context of these analyses.&#13;
(h)   Develop rural income indicators, assess on and off-farm employment in project&#13;
target areas, and perform pre and post investment M&amp;E on a sample basis.&#13;
(i)    Carry out field monitoring trips on a regular basis, in association with the&#13;
implementing agencies, and test out these M&amp;E systems for further refinement&#13;
as necessary. Ensure that the M&amp;E systems provide immediate feedback to allow&#13;
corrective measures to be introduced as early as possible.&#13;
(j)   Liaise with MOA and MOE policy units and develop environmental economic&#13;
impact assessment indicators for project target areas.&#13;
&#13;

Estonia Agriculture Project&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
Land Reform Component&#13;
I. The Project&#13;
A. Component Objectives&#13;
1.    The broad objective of the land reform component of the project is to assist Estonia in&#13;
the development of the land market, which would facilitate: (a) the land reform (restitution and&#13;
privatization of the land); (b) the use of land as collateral to obtain long tern credit, and&#13;
subsequent farm restructuring; and (c) exit and entry into farming. The establishment of such a&#13;
market requires developing the legal framework, as well as the technical and institutional capacity.&#13;
The immediate and main objective of the project component is to speed up land survey and land&#13;
registration in the land cadastre.&#13;
B. Component Scope&#13;
2.     Land Reform. The total area of agricultural and forest lands to be eventually privatized&#13;
is estimated at 2.3 million hectares (including natural grasslands, arable land, orchards and&#13;
forests). The reform of land ownership, farm organization and property rights is a central element&#13;
of Estonia's economic reform. The actual process of formal transfer of ownership to the newly&#13;
established private farms has been slower than desirable. Despite the importance attached by GOE&#13;
to land reform and privatization, only 13% of this area has been divested to private control to date&#13;
(including restituted land and land under the Farn Law Act of 1989). The slow progress of land&#13;
reform can be attributed variously to the difficulties in the development of the legal frmework,&#13;
insufficient institutional arrangements, and limited financial resources to complete the land&#13;
surveys. The approach chosen for the land reform - physical restitution based on pre-1940&#13;
boundaries - seems to be the most significant factor in slowing down land privatization, and&#13;
creating uncertainties as to the rights of the farmers. Even if restitution were proceed faster, it&#13;
is unclear that it would improve land use and expedite the development of an active land market.&#13;
Many land owners have chosen alternative lands or non-land compensation in place of accepting&#13;
their "ancestral lands." Consequently, a significant amount of the arable and forest lands remains&#13;
under state ownership after the end of the first stage of land reform.&#13;
3.     Up to December 1995, 23,529 units (approx. 223,000 ha) have been registered in the&#13;
cadastre and 11,000 parcels (approx. 180,000 ha) in the title book. Estimated registration in 1995&#13;
was 15,000 units (approx. 130,000 ha). The National Land Board (NLB) plans to register over&#13;
1,500 cadastral units (13,000 ha) per month in 1996.&#13;
4.     The implementation of land reform in Estonia requires well-defined prerequisites and&#13;
priorities, as well as better sequencing of reform elements, so that a well-functioning land market&#13;
can emerge. The most important part of the land reform is to continue, and finalize the restitution&#13;
of the properties. An important task for GOE is to work out a state land disposal policy for state-&#13;
owned lands in rural areas. The project also aims to accelerate the reform process on areas where&#13;
it has been slow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP I&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
5.     SimRlifving cadastral and title book registration. Titling is not an end in itself, but a&#13;
means to achieve security of tenure, and to provide information to facilitate land transactions&#13;
through an accurate and up-to-date registration system. Estonia adopted a land registration system&#13;
that is close to the German Real Property System and requires registration based on exact land&#13;
survey. The titling procedure was already simplified by the "Law of Amending the Legal Acts&#13;
Relating to the Implementation Law of Real Property Law", (August 12, 1994). However, the&#13;
Title Book Offices still need three months to register the title, which prolongs the procedure.&#13;
6.     The Government is working on simplifying regulations and devising appropriate measures&#13;
to limit the cost and time spent per unit restituted or privatized. The Governmental Decree "The&#13;
order for restitution of the properties on the base of existing maps" was passed in early 1995. This&#13;
order allows restitution of lands to the previous owners without completing an exact land survey.&#13;
The property borders would be registered based on existing maps prepared during the Soviet era.&#13;
However, only 20% of all properties could be registered this way. Another option being explored&#13;
would include the issuance of a "provisional" title with regard to the estimated boundaries.&#13;
Boundaries would only be demarcated in the field and simply indicated to owners. Boundaries&#13;
would also be registered on the cadastral maps. Further clarification of boundaries can be done&#13;
later, if deemed necessary by appropriate parties, prior to market transactions (buyers, sellers,&#13;
banks, etc.). Despite the above options, experience in East Gernany shows that transitional&#13;
measures cannot fully compensate for exact surveys, and that there is no alternative to carrying&#13;
out land surveys. Regardless of the legal framework, owners need to know what precisely they&#13;
own, and where their borders are, especially when it comes to land transactions and cultivation.&#13;
7.     Physical restitution versus voucher compensation. The vouchers will be replaced with&#13;
special privatization banking accounts. It is possible to use the privatization bank accounts to pay&#13;
for privatized lands and other properties. The compensation for lands and other properties is&#13;
deposited in a privatization bank account, and can be used for privatization of apartments, lands,&#13;
shares of companies, etc. In some rural areas, it seems likely that owners would more readily&#13;
accept compensation than restitution. In Tallinn, for instance, almost every property will be&#13;
restituted, but many owners opt for compensation for their agricultural lands in rural areas.&#13;
However the compensation value for rural lands is small. Owners are not willing to opt for&#13;
compensation immediately, and are postponing their decisions, although every owner was&#13;
supposed to have decided by April 1995 whether to opt for restitution or compensation. The new&#13;
Govermment has decided to compensate only the lands that could not be restituted.&#13;
8.     Reorganization of Est-survey. In a market economy, there is little need for parcel&#13;
surveying to be carried out by a public agency. To expedite parcel surveys, Est-survey, the state-&#13;
owned land survey company, which has already lost more than half of it's surveyors to the private&#13;
sector, needs to be privatized. Reorganization of the National Land Board (NLB) has started by&#13;
re-integrating the Department of the Cadastre of Est-survey into NLB. The cadastral Center of&#13;
NLB was established. The County Land Cadastre Offices have been established in ten of the&#13;
counties and the rest (five) will be established before the end of May, 1996. A special Decree&#13;
passed by the Government (Decree 9, January, 1995) regulates the re-organization of the National&#13;
Land Board. The Decree specifies that:&#13;
(a) The NLB would be an effective organization responsible for Land Cadastre,&#13;
Geodesy and Mapping;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP I&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
(b) The activities of NLB would be coordinated with other involved institutions; and&#13;
(c) The NLB should not compete with the private sector on an equal basis for&#13;
specific land survey activities.&#13;
9. The Governmental Decree further stipulates that:&#13;
(a) The Department of the Cadastre of Est-survey, the Department of Informatics,&#13;
and the Archive shall be re-integrated into NLB.&#13;
(b) The Mapping Center shall be re-integrated into the NLB.&#13;
(c) The County Est-Survey Offices will be privatized or terninated.&#13;
10    Privatization of the county land survey offices was planned for the beginning of 1996.&#13;
NLB hopes that the tender for privatizing the first five County Offices of Est-survey can be&#13;
published by May, 1996 and that the bidding process can take place before June, 1996.&#13;
11.   Role of private sector At the present moment, there are 125 licensed private surveying&#13;
companies, and 48 individual surveyors in Estonia that are involved in land surveying, which is&#13;
a necessary part of the process of restitution, replacement, selling and purchase of land, as well&#13;
as of the contractual use of land. In addition, 138 licenses for geodetic and cartographic work&#13;
have been given out. A study has shown that approximately 95% of the companies are now&#13;
actively operating. There are still an additional 39 private companies and surveyors that have&#13;
applied for a license. In the near future, a new status of surveyor will be given out to some of&#13;
the license owners. In addition to the surveying work, the owner of the new license could also&#13;
perform juridical operations regarding cadastre works. According to estimations, the above-&#13;
mentioned companies would continue the work in the future, but their activities would be&#13;
supervised and they would be provided with up-to-date geodetic network information and existing&#13;
map information in order to guarantee a coordinated functioning of the whole cadastral system.&#13;
This task would be performed by the NLB.&#13;
12.    Prioritization and sequencing of survey works and cadastre registration. Even after all the&#13;
above measures are taken, the costs of titling, and the time it takes, are likely to be substantial.&#13;
Systematic titling should be sequenced and prioritized. The following criteria to prioritize the&#13;
survey work location, in order of importance are:&#13;
(a) Drainage rehabilitation sites: The project supports the rehabilitation of drainage&#13;
systems and these lands should be surveyed as a first priority. A large number of the&#13;
properties surveyed under this project can be selected on the basis of drainage rehabilitation&#13;
areas.&#13;
(b) Regional Policy Sites: These are areas where land reform has been slow in the&#13;
past and where demand for restitution is limited, but develop of local infrastructure and&#13;
farming is important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 1&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
(c) Higher potential market value: These are areas with desirable land use/quality&#13;
attributes, or location attributes, such as better soil quality, better access to the urban&#13;
markets, etc.&#13;
(d) Lower potential cost for adjudication: These are areas where potential owners are&#13;
easily identifiable and whose claims are least likely to be contested by others in the process&#13;
of titling. Land covered by the present farming law, in which the private farmers have&#13;
perpetual use rights but no rights to sell or mortgage land, can fit into this criteria.&#13;
13. Adiustment in land confiauration and easements: The restructuring of large enterprise&#13;
farms offers the opportunity for adjusting the shapes and sizes of the subdivided parcels&#13;
within these farms. This is especially a problem where restituted owners have fragmented&#13;
pieces of land within a large farm, or where such pieces have no access to roads or&#13;
services.&#13;
ONGOING AND REQUESTED PROJECTS&#13;
14.   Under separate arrangements, donor-funded parallel projects provide technical assistance&#13;
and training for strengthening the institutional and technical capacities of the NLB and related&#13;
agencies.&#13;
(a) Land Registry Management Advice (96-98) will be carried out by SwedSurvey&#13;
and financed by Sweden as part of larger program which has been agreed in principle for&#13;
1996. Continuation of this sub-component is agreed with SwedSurvey for longer term.&#13;
(b) Land Assessment Methodology Development (95-96) has been agreed with the&#13;
Finnish Government and the project is running. The land assessment methodology so far&#13;
has been created in close cooperation with Finnish experts and the changes into the system&#13;
will be worked out together.&#13;
(c) Land and Real Estate Legal Advice (96-98) has been intensively investigated and&#13;
two possible donors have been identified: Sweden and Austria.&#13;
(d) Training of Surveyors (95-97) contains three different projects: Continuation of&#13;
LIMPE-project (EU-PHARE); the training for trainers in surveying; and later courses on&#13;
the equipment and software purchased in the LIMPE-project previous phase.&#13;
(e) Training of Cadastral Specialists (96-97). This Sub-Component is planned inside&#13;
the same PHARE-programn, and part of it will be covered by Sweden and Germany. It is&#13;
planned to introduce to the local cadastral specialists the goals of the modern cadastral&#13;
system and the different ways to achieve them.&#13;
(f) Support for development and implementation of the cadastral system in county&#13;
offices and central cadastral office. The main elements for the county (decentralized)&#13;
system are the interface to IPIS (alphanumeric cadastre) and data exchange between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP I&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
counties, the central system and surveyors. The main elements for the central system are:&#13;
design of dataflow (basic map, cadastral map, ground control points); interface to other&#13;
registers; data exchange; and service for the public and private sector.&#13;
(g) Mapping and cartography. Project plans cover the period from 1995 to 1999. The&#13;
main activities are aerial photography, production of digital line maps, and orthophotos&#13;
corresponding to the national map-production plans. Total budget is approximately&#13;
8,000,000 SEK. Financed by Sweden.&#13;
(h) Photogrammetric and surveying equipment. This request includes 5 analytical&#13;
Photogrammetric instruments, digitizers, plotters and printers, workstations for map editing,&#13;
server, etc. to be delivered in 1996 and 1997. Total budget is approximately CHF&#13;
2.500.000. Financed by Switzerland.&#13;
D. Component Description&#13;
15.   The land reform component provides financing for land survey works, and for creating&#13;
and densifying the National Geodetic Network.&#13;
16.   The National Geodetic Network (NGN) will need reconstruction, and until the work on&#13;
re-measurement of the NGN is finalized, the kinematic GPS receivers can be used for&#13;
establishment of lower order networks, to coordinate the boundaries in one unified coordinate&#13;
system. This work will allow the definition of the boundaries to the cadastral map to be of higher&#13;
accuracy and will enable the surveying of the boundaries of large territories quickly and with high&#13;
accuracy. The program is planned for four years, because in 1999, the measurements on the NGN&#13;
will be completed or the network would be in the position that the majority of boundaries can be&#13;
tied to the NGN. Within four years, 3,000 points will be measured, with the points measured&#13;
using GPS technology available for future measurements. The estimated price for measurement&#13;
of one point is US$470, and the total price of the component is US$1,410,000 (60% with World&#13;
Bank financing for US$846,000). The most important idea of the component is not to re-&#13;
coordinate the boundaries, but to get exact information in one unified system. All the work will&#13;
be contracted out through local competitive bidding.&#13;
17.   Cadastral Survey. The lack of adequate budgetary allocations, as well as fixed-price&#13;
contracts to private surveyors (at one half of the market price), has contributed to a considerable&#13;
slow down of restitution irelated to cadastral registration. Est-Survey, the state agency which had&#13;
traditionally carried out parcel surveying, has been losing it's surveyors to the private sector.&#13;
Indeed, there is no justification for parcel surveying still to be carried out by the public sector.&#13;
A major component of the project - US$5,260,000 (60% World Bank financing for US$3,154,000)&#13;
- therefore, is budgetary support for procuring parcel surveying using Local Competitive Bidding&#13;
procedures. The contracts should be prepared in a way that the survey area is divided into&#13;
attractive sized packages at the district level, with a cost amounting US$250,000 per contract.&#13;
The choice and sequencing of areas should follow criteria identified above. According to the&#13;
proposals and estimations in the frame of this project, approximately 7,800 rural properties (total&#13;
area approx. 151,000 ha will be surveyed at cost of approximately US$35/ha.&#13;

II. Implementation Armngements&#13;
A. Responsibilities of Implementing Agencies&#13;
19.   National Land Board. The NLB will be responsible for: development of cadastral&#13;
registration and cadastral mapping in Estonia; overseeing the decentralization of cadastral work&#13;
to the county level; speeding up and simplifying the surveying and registration process; and&#13;
ensuring coordination with the Title Book Offices. NLB will be will be responsible for&#13;
contracting out all the survey contracts (World Bank and budgetary financed survey works)&#13;
through national competitive bidding procedures, and to supervise the contracts. NLB would&#13;
appoint staff required for the coordination of the land reform component.&#13;
20    The Government of Estonia. The Ministry of Environment, and the Land Reform&#13;
Commission will coordinate the activities in connection with this component in order to improve&#13;
the legal/policy environment of the land reform process. According to the Land Reform Law the&#13;
Government of Estonia and local municipalities are responsible for implementation of land reform.&#13;
The Land Reform Commission is mandated to coordinate land policy for GOE and legislators. The&#13;
Commission consists of representatives of the Ministries of Justice, Agriculture, and Environment,&#13;
The National Land Board, and members of Parliament and Local Authorities.&#13;
21.   The Contract Administration Unit (CAU) will be established in NLB to organize and&#13;
supervise of the land survey works. The CAU would consist of a project coordinator and 4-5 staff&#13;
to recruit surveyors through a competitive process. The CAU will organize this competitive&#13;
bidding and perform relevant accounting functions. The project coordinator of the CAU would&#13;
coordinate with the local municipalities, the relevant ministries, and other authorities to be&#13;
involved. Survey contracts will be prepared together with the local municipalities which would&#13;
decide where to carry out the surveys. The areas will be selected according to defined priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP I&#13;
Page 7 of 9&#13;
B. Implementation Agreement&#13;
22.   NLB would establish the Contract Administration Unit and appoint staff required for&#13;
coordination of the land reform project component.&#13;
C. Role of World Bank During Supervision&#13;
23.   The component will be supervised by the Bank personnel (or designated consultants) in&#13;
accordance with the proposed supervision plan.&#13;
III. Implementation Plan&#13;
A. Time Bound Schedule&#13;
24.   As survey works are involved in the project component, the implementing agency would&#13;
start with procurement preparation prior to the start of the project. Area selection, according to&#13;
priorities, can be done in parallel with the preparation of bidding documents.&#13;
25.   The GPS measurements would be started in October 1996 and finished in December 1999,&#13;
and approximately 3,000 points will be measured. The Cadastral Surveys would start in October&#13;
1996 and be finished in December 1999. Preparation of bidding documents can start after&#13;
negotiations with the Bank, and bidding can take place from July-September 1996.&#13;
B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule&#13;
26.   For all items funded through the loan proceeds, The Borrower agrees that: (a) it would&#13;
apply procurement procedures which are consistent with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January, 1995 ).&#13;
Table I summarizes the major procurement packages of this component and their schedules.&#13;
Procurement for Bank-financed activities would be undertaken as described below:&#13;
27.   Technical Services (US$ 6.7 million). Technical Services:  This would consist of&#13;
surveying contracts in individual packages at an individual cost of US $250,000, each hired&#13;
through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank, following a pre-&#13;
qualification. Standardized bidding documents and pre-qualification criteria would be developed&#13;
following Bank procurement guidelines. Preference for local private surveyors is justified&#13;
considering the following reasons: (a) parcel surveying at the local level is labor intensive,&#13;
requiring knowledge of the area, local real estate and cadastre laws, local regulations and mobility;&#13;
(b) parcel surveying by local firms will build local capacity in the private sector, and help build&#13;
the foundation for competitive real estate brokerage services in the future; and (c) a large number&#13;
of local companies are available to carry out these works.&#13;

AGRICULTURE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
DRAINAGE REHABILITATION AND LAND MANAGEMENT COMPONENT&#13;
I. The Component&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
1.    The objective of the component is to assist in the restructuring and revitalization of Estonian&#13;
agriculture. In line with this objective, the drainage rehabilitation and maintenance component focuses&#13;
on action required to address critical needs resulting from neglect of drainage infrastructure during the&#13;
transition period, and, after a one time rehabilitation, aims at handing over future operations and&#13;
maintenance of the drainage system to the beneficiaries. Not all of the lands drained in the past should&#13;
be rehabilitated due to both environmental and economic concerns. Hence, the project will focus on:&#13;
(a)   limited physical rehabilitation and maintenance of drainage systems on lands with high&#13;
agricultural values and production potentials;&#13;
(b)    promotion and establishment of Land and Water Associations (LWAs) to take over&#13;
ownership, management and financial responsibility for all on-farm systems (once&#13;
rehabilitated) above the large main drains; and&#13;
(c)   reorientation of drainage research and training, emphasizing practical field application for&#13;
cost effective maintenance.&#13;
B. Component Description&#13;
2.    The drainage rehabilitation component will consist of: (a) physical works on 60,000 ha over five&#13;
years (less than 10% of drained farmland in Estonia), covering main drain rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance, rehabilitation and maintenance of collector drains, flushing and repair of subsurface pipe&#13;
outlets entering collector drains, and selective tillage of compacted soils in the context of drainage&#13;
improvement; (b) establishment of about 60 LWAs within the project area as formation of farmer groups&#13;
to assume ownership of on-farm drainage systems and bear full responsibility for future operations and&#13;
maintenance of the systems once rehabilitated; and (c) development of an adaptive research progmm to&#13;
test innovative techniques for reducing and controlling maintenance costs. This project component also&#13;
includes related training and studies. The drainage systems targeted for rehabilitation would be selected&#13;
on the basis of social, technical, economic and environmental criteria.&#13;
3.    The land management component consists of studies of, and equipment for, environmentally&#13;
sensitive areas.&#13;
Physical Rehabilitation of the Drainage Systems&#13;
4.    The drainage systems in Estonia are extensive and critical to the future productivity of agricultural&#13;
systems. Natural conditions for agriculture are far from optimal, primarily due to the short growing season&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 2&#13;
Page 2 of 18&#13;
and the generally poor soil conditions. Although precipitation is fairly uniform between 570 and 720&#13;
mm/year, 65% of this rainfall occurs during a 5-month period from May to September with distinctive&#13;
and critical peaks during short periods. On areas where natural drainage is inadequate during peak&#13;
rainfalls, improved drainage through artificial means can extend the growing season for about a month&#13;
by ensuring that groundwater table can be maintained at least 40 cm below surface. Drainage regulates&#13;
moisture content and the depth of the groundwater table in the soils. Well drained lands can be planted&#13;
earlier and harvested later, as waterlogging during rainfall peaks can be avoided and fields are dry enough&#13;
for farm machinery to operate. In the context of the project, drainage rehabilitation will not be carried&#13;
out on polders where submerged lands are drained for agricultural purposes. Drainage improvement&#13;
will be primarily aimed at regulating the depth (below surface) of the groundwater table and moisture of&#13;
the soils during critical periods, and thereby lengthening the growing season and increasing crop and&#13;
pasture yields.&#13;
5.     Transitional adjustments of the economy have resulted in a lack of funding for the maintenance&#13;
of the drainage systems since 1988. Subsurface pipe systems will require selective flushing of lines to&#13;
remove sediments and improve their proper performance, but rehabilitation work is important for restoring&#13;
the capacity and depth of many open main and field drains. The cleaning of open drainage canals allows&#13;
the free flow of subsurface pipes, thus maintaining their flow capacity. This work has to be done&#13;
selectively, applying a set of criteria for prioritizing rehabilitation work and limiting the physical works&#13;
to lands where environmental damage will be minimal and agricultural productivity can be profitable and&#13;
sustainable. When maintenance is deferred too long up to a point, these drainage systems can no longer&#13;
be maintained or rehabilitated, and reconstruction would be prohibitive in costs and economically&#13;
questionable. Rehabilitation costs on lands targeted by the project are estimated to be about EEK 1,500/ha&#13;
in 1995 financial terms, a small fraction (7.5%) of the full reconstruction costs of about EEK 20,000/ha.&#13;
Selection Criteria for Drainage Rehabilitation Sites'&#13;
6.     Selection of Areas. Drainage rehabilitation works will be undertaken on a total 60,000 ha, less&#13;
than 10% of the existing agricultural lands that have already been drained. Drainage investments will be&#13;
limited to rehabilitation works and will not involve investments in new drainage schemes. Sites where&#13;
drainage rehabilitation would not be allowed include:&#13;
*    areas where fish and wildlife habitat is protected by Estonian environmental laws or rules;&#13;
a    poldered areas;&#13;
*    wetlands and estuaries with important wildlife or fishery values;&#13;
*    important native grasslands, buffer zones, and forest lands of special significance;&#13;
*    forest lands, until the forest strategy study is completed;&#13;
7.     Potential sites would be screened individually and thoroughly, following a selection process to&#13;
ensure that technical, economic, social and environmental criteria are fulfilled. Each of the following&#13;
selection criteria shall be fulfilled before commencement of the drainage rehabilitation works:&#13;
(a)    Environmental Screening. Each drainage site shall be screened and cleared for&#13;
The selection criteria have been specified in a supplemental letter to the loan agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP2&#13;

rehabilitation by the Ministry of Environment or the respective District Environment&#13;
Protection Department according to official regulations on the environmental screening&#13;
criteria. The environmental screening process of the drainage rehabilitation program is&#13;
elaborated in Annex 4: Environmental Aspects;&#13;
(b)    Soil Fertility. Each drainage rehabilitation site shall have an average soil fertility of no&#13;
less than 40 points out of a scale of 100 based on the Estonian Soils Classification&#13;
System. Soils with less than 40 points can only be included up to no more than 10% of&#13;
each site area only when this substandard area must be included because of hydraulic&#13;
design requirements. This condition aims for the best 25% of the drained farmlands, and&#13;
practically excludes 75% of the existing drained farmlands;&#13;
(c)    Land use intensity. More than 70% of the agricultural land shall currently be utilized for&#13;
agricultural purposes;&#13;
(d)    Conditions of the Drainage Systems. Each drainage site shall be assessed and approved&#13;
for rehabilitation by the local amelioration bureau based on technical and engineering&#13;
feasibility;&#13;
(e)    Development Costs. Rehabilitation costs of the drainage system, including civil works,&#13;
designs, and supervision, shall not exceed EEK 1,500/ha in constant 1995 prices. This&#13;
limit will exclude areas that require excessive and complex rehabilitation works;&#13;
(h)    Farmers' Participation. Farmers would have fonned LWAs in accordance with the Land&#13;
Amelioration Law. The LWAs would:&#13;
(i)    make an application for the rehabilitation works;&#13;
(ii)   jointly approve the program of works together with the Amelioration&#13;
Bureaux in the county;&#13;
(iii)   undertake maintenance of the system after it is rehabilitated, and ensure&#13;
that on-farm drainage systems are effectively maintained;&#13;
(iv)   contribute 20 per cent of the physical rehabilitation costs through cash or&#13;
labor prior to commencement of designs and civil works; and&#13;
(v)    meet the administrative and operational costs (such as expenses for&#13;
meetings and book keeping) of the Association.&#13;
(f)    Land Tenure. Before commencement of the drainage rehabilitation works, no more than&#13;
5% of the agricultural land in any specific drainage site to benefit from drainage&#13;
rehabilitation would remain state -owned or not leased to the private sector, with the&#13;
exception of educational establishments. All lease contracts for state-owned agricultural&#13;
land should be for a period of not less than 10 years. The extent to which land has been&#13;
privatized and/or restituted will be considered2. This includes lands actually used by&#13;
farmers, lands leased to farmers, and lands for which the owners opted for compensation.&#13;
Further, all state-owned agricultural lands in a specific drainage site would be available&#13;
2      Cadastral surveys of drainage sites would be prioritized by the Land Board, and all lands benefiting from drainage would&#13;
be registered in the cadastre prior to commencement of the drainage works at any specific site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 2&#13;
Page 4 of 18&#13;
for sale or lease prior to the beginning of the drainage rehabilitation works on that site.&#13;
The number of unresolved land disputes in each proposed site will also be used as a&#13;
criteria for selection or non-selection, and will be evaluated through the proposed social&#13;
assessments; and&#13;
8.    In addition to the selection criteria, the rehabilitation and maintenance of open drains will be&#13;
carried out using techniques to minimize environmental damages. These implementation criteria will&#13;
include the following:&#13;
*     limiting excavation to design cross-sectional lines when channel cleanouts are carried out;&#13;
having equipment work from one side of the channel wherever possible;&#13;
*     in view of-the need for sediment control, minimize damage to vegetation on channel side&#13;
slopes; and&#13;
*     install instream sediment traps where needed.&#13;
9.    Phasing of Development. Applying the physical criteria for area selection, the 12 Amelioration&#13;
Bureaux (ABs) throughout the country (under the coordination of the Amelioration Unit in the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture) have preliminarily selected 42,000 ha of drainage sites located in 13 counties. To date,&#13;
no areas have been preselected in Walga and Hiiumaa counties. These potential areas of 42,000 ha have&#13;
been preselected primarily on the basis of their physical characteristics and potential, based on surveys&#13;
conducted by ABs in 1994 and early 1995. Further preselection continues in order to identify more areas&#13;
for inclusion into a pool of potential areas which will then go through a more rigorous selection process.&#13;
It is planned that design work for the 60,000 ha development program will take place over 4 years&#13;
covering: 3,500 ha in 1995; 16,500 ha in 1996; 25,000 ha in 1997 and the remaining 15,000 ha in 1998.&#13;
Physical rehabilitation works for each site will be undertaken over a period of two years once design is&#13;
completed. It is anticipated that 40% of the physical works will be done in the first year after design is&#13;
completed, and the remaining 60% completed in the second year. Initially physical works will concentrate&#13;
on main canals and collector drains, and subsequently on repairs of subsurface field drains. Design&#13;
planning, LWA development and strengthening and physical works will take place over a period of 3&#13;
years for each site. With this time framework, the aggregate plan for physical works will be spread over&#13;
a period of 5 years: commencing in the summer of 1996 with 1,400 ha; 8,700 ha in 1997; 19,900 ha in&#13;
1998; 21,000 ha in 1999 and the rest of 9,000 ha in year 2000.&#13;
10.   Pilot sites. In the preselection process, the Amelioration Unit (AU) of MOA has identified two&#13;
pilot sites for detailed assessment and environmental screening in 1995. These sites, namely Vigala (2,300&#13;
ha drained area) of Rapla county and Rannu (1,660 ha drained area) of Tartu county (should they meet&#13;
the full requirements of the project, including the social preparation and LWA development aspects) would&#13;
be thoroughly designed in 1995 using existing budget sources, followed by physical works in 1996 and&#13;
1997 under the project. It is anticipated that the total areas of these 2 pilot sites for rehabilitation would&#13;
not exceed 3,500 ha.&#13;
11.   Cost Recovery. The GOE plans to privatize the ownership, operations and maintenance of all&#13;
farm drainage systems by handing over these systems to established LWAs. The Amelioration Law of May&#13;
1994 requires the formation of LWAs to take over the systems. Under the same law, ABs can levy cost&#13;
recovery fees from users. LWA Membership is compulsory for every beneficiary of the specific drainage&#13;
basin. GOE has determined that each LWA must agree to contribute (in cash or in kind) 20% of the cost&#13;
of the one-round of selective rehabilitation works, while GOE pays for the rest of the upfront costs for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 2&#13;
Page 5 of 18&#13;
upgrading the systems to conditions that can normally be maintained. In return, the GOE would no longer&#13;
be financially responsible for these on-farm drainage systems, and each LWA will have full ownership&#13;
of its area-specific drainage system and bear full costs of the O&amp;M responsibility. GOE is therefore&#13;
effectively privatizing the drainage systems. However, the ABs will continue to be responsible for&#13;
operations and maintenance of rivers and main canals outside the drainage areas, as the main canals often&#13;
serve other users such as industries and municipalities. Cost recovery options for the maintenance of&#13;
rivers and main canals are being considered by the AU, including: (a) the possibility of transferring the&#13;
financial responsibility of this maintenance to the respective municipalities which can then recover these&#13;
costs from beneficiaries through local municipal taxes, and; (b) direct levies to LWAs, and other users.&#13;
Development of Land and Water Associations&#13;
12.   The Government through the Amelioration Law of 1994 intends to privatize the ownership of&#13;
existing drainage systems and transfer the responsibility of operations and maintenance of the systems to&#13;
the farmers organized in Land and Water Associations (LWAs). The desirable direction for the&#13;
management of the drainage system is to promote increasing farmer participation in system management&#13;
and maintenance, with the Amelioration Bureaux (ABs) of the Government eventually playing a limited&#13;
but important regulatory and oversight role. However, the realities of the current conditions warrant a&#13;
transition arrangement until: (a) the ABs can effectively perform planning, regulatory, and emergency&#13;
management functions; and (b) the LWAs can take over most of the system management functions at the&#13;
local level above the main drainage channels. At present, there are four LWAs registered under the old&#13;
Law of Associations predating the present Amelioration Law. Five to ten LWAs are anticipated to be&#13;
registered in 1995. In the present context of Estonian agriculture, formation of such associations under&#13;
the new law (which specifies financial and management responsibilities of farmers) will be progressive&#13;
and will need a strong program of action for reasons given below.&#13;
13.   Given the uncertainties surrounding land ownership and use, unstable input and output prices, and&#13;
weak access to market intelligence, it does not appear easy for farmers to take over immediate&#13;
responsibility for the drainage system. The assumption of management and financial responsibilities for&#13;
the drainage system by the LWAs must be planned and developed in a sequential, participatory and&#13;
evolutionary manner. A blueprint approach is clearly not desirable. Under these circumstances, it is&#13;
planned that the Government will extend financial assistance to the LWAs for one round of selective&#13;
rehabilitation of system, especially collector drains and related drainage systems, to prevent their further&#13;
deterioration during the transition. Once rehabilitated to conditions where these systems would require&#13;
normal and routine maintenance, the LWAs would assume full responsibility for subsequent operations,&#13;
maintenance and periodic rehabilitation in the future.&#13;
14.   Size and Functions of LWAs. The size of the Association would depend on the hydraulic area&#13;
to be served, taking into account the size of each catchment area. It is expected that each Association&#13;
would eventually cover about 1,000 ha and the Associations in the proposed project area for Bank support&#13;
will likely number about 60. The primary responsibilities of the Association would be: (a) involvement&#13;
in the planning, acceptance and implementation of rehabilitation works; (b) system maintenance of on-&#13;
farm main drains, collector drains, and drain outlets; and (c) protection of the system against theft and&#13;
destruction. To this end, the associations would be legally empowered to enter into contracts with repair&#13;
and maintenance companies and borrow funds where necessary. In addition, the LWAs would provide&#13;
an organized forum for farmers and external agencies for discussions and action on business planning, land&#13;
improvement, and agricultural development issues including needs for advisory services or extension. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 2&#13;
Page 6 of 18&#13;
LWAs would also, over time, organize training programs for their members in technical and financial&#13;
management and investment planning. Relevant laws regulating the functions of the LWAs include: Land&#13;
Amelioration Law (1994); Law on Associations (1992); Business Law (1995); and the Water Law (1994).&#13;
15.   Internal Organization and Management of LWAs. While each LWA is responsible for establishing&#13;
each own management, the Land Amelioration Law stipulates that each association must comply with the&#13;
Law of Associations (1992). In general, a Chairperson is elected for a maximum period of 5 years, either&#13;
directly by members (a case when the size of the LWA is less than 10 members) or through the LWA&#13;
Board. Main responsibilities of the Chairperson include the overall functioning of the LWA, chairing the&#13;
LWA Board, and chairing the annual meetings of the LWA. The LWA Board, in cases needed for larger&#13;
LWAs, is elected by members. Annually, a third of the board members are to be replaced through an&#13;
election. Jointly, the Chairperson and the Board are responsible for: (a) day-to-day activities, including&#13;
supervision of farmers' contribution to the maintenance of the drainage system; (b) maintaining contacts&#13;
with the Amelioration Bureau, the Municipality, the county office of the Land Board, the Farmers' Union,&#13;
and other LWAs in the vicinity; (c) representing the LWA in meetings with third parties; and (d)&#13;
organizing annual meetings where decisions are made on budget, administrative and operational matters.&#13;
Voting is based on simple majority: one vote for each member (regardless of the size of the individual&#13;
member's farm), unless otherwise specified in the constitution document of the association. The LWA,&#13;
depending on size, will also have an Executive Secretariat consisting of technical staff who can deal with&#13;
specific matters related to (for example) operations and maintenance, machinery, technical calculations&#13;
and budgeting, preliminary designs and internal approval of works. The LWA may also employ&#13;
administrative and accounting personnel on a full or part-time basis. Should the LWAs be larger than&#13;
30 members, an internal auditing committee is formed.&#13;
16.   Procedure for LWA Formation. Once an initiative is taken to form an association by a group of&#13;
farmers, most commonly a Task Force is formed for the preparation of a constitutional meeting and its&#13;
subsequent series of discussions and consultations for the preparation of the Constitution Document of the&#13;
association. This Task Force may consist of a few farmers, a representative from the Amelioration&#13;
Bureau, and a representative from the Municipality. The LWA becomes a legal entity once registered&#13;
at the county level. The registration process may take one week to a few months in cases where legal&#13;
complication arises. Preparation for the Constitution Document requires active participation from farmers&#13;
so that intemal rules and regulations of the association can be formulated satisfactorily. The Constitution&#13;
Document must necessarily cover basic issues relating to: (a) level of membership entrance and annual&#13;
fees; (b) definition of shared responsibilities and costs; (c) procedures for calculating and allocating shared&#13;
costs; (d) collection procedures for shared costs; (e) description of the use of revenues and fees; (f)&#13;
regulations to deal with non-payment of shared costs; (g) methods to deal with inflation; and (h) other&#13;
administrative, financial, operational, management and organizational aspects of the association.&#13;
17.   Training and Government Assistance for LWA Development. The formation of effective LWAs&#13;
will require a major effort on the part of the Amelioration Bureaux. The experience of the present AB&#13;
staff is largely technical, and until recently has not involved extensive participatory interaction with&#13;
farmers. In some cases, the farmers too are new to the agricultural scene. It is important that the ABs&#13;
participate actively in the formation of Associations because they would have to enter into several rounds&#13;
of discussions and negotiations with members of the Association to come up with an agreement on and&#13;
joint approval of the scope of rehabilitation works and responsibilities, prior to the commencement of&#13;
physical works on each site. A systematic program of communication and training will be necessary to&#13;
induce ABs to participate actively in strengthening the LWAs in using enabling legislation. To this end,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 2&#13;
Page 7 of 18&#13;
the staff of the ABs will need training and advisory assistance on the legal, organizational and financial&#13;
aspects of farmers' organization. The GOE is committed to provide funding through its budget sources&#13;
to: (a) train the staff of the ABs: and (b) recruit and train local consultants to serve as facilitators in the&#13;
context of the LWA development and to assist in the formulation of various agreements between the&#13;
Government and LWAs on the scope of rehabilitation works and shared responsibilities for each site.&#13;
Training of the AB staff and LWA development facilitators is planned to commence in 1996 and continue&#13;
intermittently until 1997.&#13;
18.   In direct connection with LWA development, the Government provides assistance in three forms:&#13;
(a) one-time assistance in the form of office equipment, software and supplies; (b) training and extension&#13;
related to skill development of the LWA leaders and members for organizing and managing their day-to-&#13;
day tasks (administration, accounting, technical operations and maintenance etc.); and (c) provision for&#13;
start-up costs associated with formation of the LWAs including consultations, communications, legal paper&#13;
work, right up to registration at the county level. The costs associated with these three forms of direct&#13;
assistance to the LWA are estimated on average at EEK 90,000 in year 1995 financial terms per LWA.&#13;
The GOE will provide the MOA with adequate budget allocations to cover these expenses.&#13;
19.    Social Assessment. Studies and Technical Assistance. During the course of the project, the&#13;
Amelioration Unit will commission three studies, namely: (a) a series of social assessment of target&#13;
drainage areas; (b) clarification of the future role of the Amelioration Bureaux; and (c) a mid-term review&#13;
of the LWA development program. These studies would be undertaken and phased appropriately to&#13;
support the overall development of the LWAs and the targeting of project's initiatives and activities.&#13;
Social assessment of target sites will be carried out early in 1996, and development of local skills to&#13;
undertake this social assessment has started in the last quarter of 1995 (post appraisal, prior to project start&#13;
date) with training provided through bilateral sources and World Bank's own resources (Fund for&#13;
Innovative Approaches in Human and Social Development-FIAHS). While the criteria for area selection&#13;
include the establishment of the LWAs and agreement by the associations to pay for part of the&#13;
rehabilitation costs, there are a number of factors that can influence the achievement of this requirement:&#13;
*      Farmers' willingness to invest in drainage rehabilitation within a specific site may not be&#13;
homogeneous; some farmers may be of pensionable age with a strong self-sufficient&#13;
attitude to survival, while others are young and learning-by-doing people who are&#13;
exchanging labor and machinery with their neighbors;&#13;
*      The level of experience among targeted farmers varies in light of new ownerships and&#13;
categories of farmers. This factor influences adaptability to an emerging market system&#13;
and ultimately farm restructuring;&#13;
*      The lengthy land restitution and privatization process underway has resulted in a mosaic&#13;
of interim and recognized rights to land ownership and use, and this condition to some&#13;
extent can inhibit long-term investments by farmers;&#13;
*      There is a need to tailor a package of assistance to farmers in order to support local&#13;
initiatives; and local capacity for designing and delivering this package is essential for the&#13;
sustainability of the investment strategy.&#13;
20.   Considering the above factors, the MOA will undertake social assessments of households, with&#13;
the objective of constructing social maps of the areas preliminarily selected for drainage rehabilitation and&#13;
using these maps as inputs for the final area selection in accordance with technical, social, economic and&#13;
environmental criteria. The preparation for this social assessment will focus on training local experts in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 2&#13;
Page 8 of 18&#13;
the methodologv of rapid assessment techniques (both qualitative and quantitative). Once this training&#13;
is completed by the end of 1995 or early 1996, the Amelioration Unit will then engage these local experts&#13;
to conduct social assessments of the preselected areas in stages over two years.&#13;
21.    Technical Standards. Prior to project launch, and during the post-appraisal period, the MOA plans&#13;
to receive technical assistance from Finland3 for: (a) development of standards on designs, materials and&#13;
work quality for drainage rehabilitation, and environmental aspects arising thereof; and (b) training on&#13;
these standards for the technical staff of the Amelioration Unit, Amelioration Bureaux and drainage&#13;
construction companies in Estonia. It is anticipated that the output of this assistance will be used&#13;
subsequently as inputs for the preparation of standard bidding documents.&#13;
Drainage Research&#13;
22.    The existing drainage research program would be reoriented to address issues of reduction in&#13;
maintenance costs, sustainability of systems, and environmental protection. The research needs are&#13;
primarily of an adaptive type to improve subsurface drain life and reduce open drain maintenance costs,&#13;
and environmental aspects arising thereof. Results of this research are expected to be available in 1998,&#13;
and practical information packages will be prepared for dissemination to LWAs in 1999. The Institute&#13;
of Water Management of the Agriculture University (Tartu) will be responsible for conducting this&#13;
research. The GOE will provide adequate funding for this research program, estimated at about US&#13;
$200,000 (base costs) including the costs of field instruments and equipment (US $50,000) and US&#13;
$150,000 for operations and staff time over a period of 5 years.&#13;
Land Use Management Studies&#13;
23.    Related to the environmental aspects of drained lands and wetlands, the project through its Land&#13;
Use Management4 component covers the following:&#13;
(a)    Wetlands Management Stratezv Study. The main objective of the strategy would be to&#13;
develop a -national strategy for wetlands in Estonia. A key component would be to&#13;
recommend a classification and identification system to establish the value of wetlands&#13;
in Estonia. This is a complementary strategy exercise, covering wetlands in forest and&#13;
agriculture areas: drained lands no longer under cultivation, or to be abandoned to natural&#13;
regrowth; peat-mined areas for restoration; and the management of polders no longer&#13;
under active operation. This activity would be coordinated with the "Wetstonia" initiative&#13;
of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature/Estonian Fund for Nature and the actions to be&#13;
supported under the Bank financed Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project. The&#13;
Wetlands Management Strategy Study would commence on June 1, 1996 and is scheduled&#13;
to be completed after one year.&#13;

(b)    Environmental Monitoring of Drainage Rehabilitation. MOE is responsible to monitor&#13;
the drainage rehabilitation works and to develop appropriate environmental screening&#13;
criteria and procedures to ensure safe environmental standards of the works. The project&#13;
would support MOE by financing laboratory equipment to analyze and monitor water&#13;
samples from the proposed drainage sites, and local consultants to conduct environmental&#13;
screening of each of the proposed sites. The laboratory equipment would be installed in&#13;
the Estonian Environmental Research Laboratory.&#13;
(c)    Environmental Studies for Future Drainage Investments. The project also supports a&#13;
sectoral environmental drainage study which will analyze future options for drained lands,&#13;
and measures needed to convert drained land from its present use to other uses such as&#13;
forest land, parks, wildlife protection areas or wetlands. This study will be commissioned&#13;
by the Ministry of Environment, funded by the project and undertaken by consultants.&#13;
Three MOE's departments will be involved in the study: Departments of Water (main&#13;
responsibility), Nature Conservation, and Environmental Impact Analysis and Normative.&#13;
The study would commence on January 1, 1997 and is scheduled to be completed after&#13;
two years.&#13;

II. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
A. Organizations Responsible for the Component7&#13;
25.    Under the supervision and coordination of the Amelioration Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture,&#13;
the Amelioration Bureaux will be responsible for the implementation of the physical rehabilitation of the&#13;
drainage systems in their own county. As there are 12 ABs throughout the country, three counties will be&#13;
covered by ABs located in nearby counties. The drainage rehabilitation works will be spread throughout&#13;
the country, and each AB is expected to be responsible for not more than 5 construction works at any&#13;
given time. This work will be done through contracts with private contractors and construction&#13;
companies. MOA will support a reoriented drainage research program to address concerns related to&#13;
system maintenance and sustainability. This research will be undertaken by the Institute of Water&#13;
Management of the Agricultural University in Tartu. LWAs will be fully responsible for future&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation of on-farm systems.&#13;
26.    Environmental screening of drainage sites will be the responsibility of the County Environmental&#13;
Offices and under the overall supervision of the MOE. The overall coordination of MOE's involvement&#13;
in this screening process will be under the responsibility of the Water Department. The Amelioration Unit&#13;
of the MOA will liaise closely with the MOE so that timing and areas to be covered for environmental&#13;
screening fit with the overall implementation phases of the project.&#13;
7       The role and functions of an Inter-Ministerial Project Steering Committee (PSC), and its composition, are described in&#13;
Annex 5. On day-to-day tasks, this PSC is assisted by two Joint Project Directors, respectively appointed from the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and the Ministry of Environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 2&#13;
Page 11 of 18&#13;
27.   The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will assist the Amelioration Unit, the Amelioration&#13;
Bureaux, and the departments in MOE, in aspects related to procurement, loan disbursement, accounting,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, as well as administrative support.&#13;
28.   GOE will provide a contingency fund to the PIU of about $400,000 equivalent, for the use by the&#13;
PIU in drainage site areas, to ensure that prior to commencement of rehabilitation works, all lands to&#13;
benefit from these works have been surveyed, registered in the cadastre, and that ownership has been&#13;
clarified and registered in the title book.&#13;
B. Agreements between Borrower and Implementing Agencies&#13;
29.   Agreements related to this component to be reached at negotiations between the Borrower and&#13;
Implementing agencies are as follows:&#13;
(a)    The MOA will work with the Ministry of Environment on assessments, evaluations, and&#13;
implementation required for the drainage rehabilitation and maintenance program to&#13;
ensure that only strategic drainage work will be undertaken in accordance with agreed&#13;
environmental considerations.&#13;
(b)    The Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture will have reached agreement&#13;
on the environmental screening criteria and procedures for the drainage rehabilitation&#13;
component.&#13;
(c)    The MOA will undertake rehabilitation works only if all the criteria for area selection&#13;
are met, including that the obligations of the LWAs are fulfilled by the LWAs.&#13;
(d)    GOE will ensure that for the priority drainage rehabilitation sites the necessary rural&#13;
infrastructure upgrading,9 currently planned under the Public Investment Plan in general&#13;
terms, will be provided at the locations of the participating LWAs as a complement to&#13;
their improved drainage systems.&#13;
(e)    The GOE will provide sufficient funding allocations to MOA for the establishment and&#13;
promotion of LWAs, including the associated training and studies as determined under the&#13;
project. In addition, GOE will also provide funding to the Institute of Water Management&#13;
for the planned research program under the project, including provision of adequate&#13;
funding for operations and staff time required for the research.&#13;
(f)    MOE will commence the Wetlands Management Strategy Study and the Environmental&#13;
Study for Future Drainage Investments with the timing as shown in this PIP, or as&#13;
otherwise agreed during the implementation.&#13;
8     Terms of reference of the PIU are presented in Annex 5. This PIU reports to the Inter-Ministerial Project Steering&#13;
Committee.&#13;
9     Rural roads, water supplies, teleconmunications, and electricity.&#13;

(g)    The Borrower shall use the standard bidding documents for NCB contracts issued by the&#13;
ECA Region.&#13;
(h)    The Borrower will establish, in the PIU, the contingency fund for land survey and&#13;
registration of the lands in each drainage rehabilitation site.&#13;
(i)    That the Borrower will prior to commencement of rehabilitation works, dispose of all&#13;
State-owned land in the chosen Project drainage sites either by sale or lease.&#13;
C. Role of the Bank During Supervision&#13;
30.   The drainage component will be supervised by Bank personnel (or designated consultants) in&#13;
accordance with the proposed supervision plan summarized in Chapter III (F) of the Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report.&#13;
m. Implementation Plan&#13;
A. Timebound Schedule&#13;
31.   The broad implementation plan for the drainage rehabilitation and maintenance component is&#13;
shown in Appendix I of this Annex. Timelines shown are for a cycle, from site selection and design to&#13;
rehabilitation works, including interactive and parallel development of the Land and Water Associations.&#13;
Appendix 1, as an example, shows the timing for Phase II (after a small pilot phase involving 3,500 ha)&#13;
16,500 ha. Critical and key steps for Phase III and Phase IV implementation schedules are similar, to&#13;
commence a year and two years later respectively from Phase II start-up date.&#13;
B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule&#13;
32.     Table 2 lists the major procurement packages and their schedules of this project component.&#13;
Table 3 provides the procurement packages of the Land Use Management component. For all items funded&#13;
under the loan proceeds, GOE agrees that: (a) it would apply procurement procedures which are&#13;
consistent with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January,&#13;
1995), and Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency (August, 1981) for procurement of Bank-financed goods and consultant's services, and&#13;
(b) that progress reports prepared by Government would include monitoring of the procurement process&#13;
of the various aggregate amounts and ceilings. Procurement methods for items funded under the loan&#13;
proceeds are as follows:&#13;
(a) Civil Works (US $7.9 million). All civil works items would be procured through National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB). NCB items for civil works are for drainage rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance. The number of contracts is expected to be about 60. NCB is justifiable because:&#13;
(a) Estonia's open competitive economy generates works at prices below the intemational market,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 2&#13;
Page 13 of 18&#13;
and (b) Estonia's laws do not prevent international contractors from participating in NCB. NCB&#13;
is appropriate given that: (a) the average values of works per site are small (less than US&#13;
$150,000 and will not exceed $300,000); (b) locations are scattered geographically (and thus not&#13;
permitting "packaging" of a number of site contrcts) and catchment areas cover non-contiguous&#13;
drainage systems of 100 to 150 hectares in size; (c) implementation requires continuous&#13;
consultations with, and participation and contribution from local farmers; (d) ownership of the&#13;
drainage rehabilitation is linked with intensive participatory preparation of establishing Land and&#13;
Water Associations; and (e) small contracts to local contractors reduce mobilization and&#13;
organization costs. Domestic bidders will not receive preferences, and contracts must be awarded&#13;
to the lowest evaluated bid in sequence. At negotiations, agreements would be sought that the&#13;
Borrower shall use standard bidding documents for NCB contracts issued by the ECA Region&#13;

AGRICULTURE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
ADVISORY SERVICES COMPONENT&#13;
L. The Component&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
1.    The uncertainties pertaining to production, transformation, marketing and land ownership have&#13;
created a large demand for agricultural extension advisory services. The objective of agricultural advisory&#13;
services in Estonia is to induce voluntary change among rural people by:&#13;
(a)   transferring technology to and from farmers for sustainable agricultural production,&#13;
processing, and marketing;&#13;
(b)    mobilizing and organizing farmers, rural groups and communities; and&#13;
(c)    educating farmers, building human resources and enhancing local capacity to generate,&#13;
transfer and use information relevant to entrepreneurial and employment opportunities,&#13;
technologies, and markets.&#13;
B. Component Description&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    Pre-independence, agricultural technology and advice moved rapidly between the technical staff&#13;
of research stations, state and collective farms, and the university. These highly specialized staff&#13;
exchanged information regularly, each of them dealing with a narrow field of activity. Because markets&#13;
and prices were predetermined and inputs provided at subsidized prices, questions on profitability,&#13;
sustainability and competition did not arise.&#13;
3.    As large farms have been dismantled, and small family farms as well as joint stock farms have&#13;
emerged, the new farmers need advice and skills that respond to the needs of a market economy. Several&#13;
extension systems used in European countries are being introduced and tested with bilateral assistance&#13;
(Denmark, Germany, Netherlands).&#13;
4.    There are about 700 people employed in Estonia who provide farmers with advice, nearly all on&#13;
a part-time basis. Agricultural advisors are employed in the following manner:&#13;
(a)   the private sector (e.g. veterinarians, advisors from the processing industries, private&#13;
consultants, input suppliers);&#13;
(b)   the public sector (e.g. staff from universities, research institutes, county staff of MOA);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 3&#13;
Page 2 of 18&#13;
(c)   the media (mostly specialized print, and to a lesser extent radio and television); and&#13;
(d)   the farmers themselves (e.g. Farmers' Union with a staff of about 150, including 60 full-&#13;
time advisors in the field, serving the family farms; or the Producers' Union mainly&#13;
serving larger joint stock farms.)&#13;
Present levels of public support for extension are low, representing about 0.05% of the agricultural GDP&#13;
whereas many countries invest about 1 - 2% of the agricultural GDP in extension.&#13;
5.     Who are the Estonian farmers. and what do they need? Roughly speaking, there are three types&#13;
of farmers operating in Estonia: (i) viable farmers and farm managers; (ii) farms that need improvements&#13;
to become viable; and (iii) the farms of questionable viability, including many part-time farms.&#13;
Distinctions between the categories are blurred, but each category has different needs, that should be&#13;
addressed --and paid for-- differently. The Project supports all three types of farmers.&#13;
(a)    The most viable farmers, including about 2,500 family farms and 1,200 joint stock farm&#13;
managers need advice on production techniques, business skills including marketing and&#13;
organization, and tactical advice, for instance to expand a herd, or switch crops. Given&#13;
a proper introduction, many of them would be willing and able to pay for advice that&#13;
benefits their individual enterprise (business development plans, soil tests, or loan&#13;
application advice). The project foresees strengthening Private Advisory Services by&#13;
supporting a Private Advisory Services Development Fund (PSADF) to provide these&#13;
farmers with advice of their choosing. The fund has the dual purpose of providing&#13;
eligible farmers with temporary and partial funding to buy advice so they get to appreciate&#13;
the value of advisory services in increasing their income, while creating competition and&#13;
enhancing quality among private agricultural advisors.&#13;
(b)    The middle categorv of farms, including about 10,000 family farms and 1,000 joint stock&#13;
farms, mainly need technical and economic advice to make their current operation more&#13;
profitable. Very often, those needs can be efficiently met through educational programs&#13;
on milk quality improvement, general business skills, or pasture management, for instance.&#13;
Such advice covers more public domain information and will continue to be carried out&#13;
by the publicly funded extension services. The Project foresees strengthening publicly&#13;
funded extension through: (i) more efficient delivery of advice; (ii) improved county&#13;
inventories of current farming systems, problems and opportunities; and (iii) increased&#13;
farner participation in priority setting.&#13;
(c)    Marginal and inviable farms. There are also an estimated number of 5,000 family farms&#13;
and 1,500 joint stock farms that must leave farning or at least supplement their income&#13;
from non-farming activities. These farmers need information on altemative employment,&#13;
on legal matters pertaining to farm closure and land rights upon liquidation, and small and&#13;
medium enterprise skills. The govemment is supporting rural information centers that aim&#13;
at the most dynamic and risk taking segment of the rural population. The Project will&#13;
support expansion of selected, rural information centers to include information on&#13;
altemative rural employment, legal matters, and other information that specifically aims&#13;
to ease the transition out of farming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 3&#13;
Page 3 of 18&#13;
6.    Critical success factors. The success of advisory services depends on: (a) quality advice that&#13;
responds to the needs of the farmers; (b) early, strong and continued government support, including&#13;
sufficient implementation capacity in a national task force on agricultural extension; and (c) effective&#13;
public relations to inform farmers and the public at large of what to expect and what not to expect from&#13;
extension. Long term success of extension will also depend on improvements in the curriculum of higher&#13;
agricultural education in Estonia to ensure that the new private and public advisors have a stronger&#13;
economic grounding, more practical and stronger communication skills and a broader general training; and&#13;
on improvements in Estonian agricultural research to make it more responsive to farmers that operate in&#13;
a competitive market. Farmers contribute to their advisory services. Most importantly, they help set the&#13;
agenda, ensuring that the advice is relevant and the advisors held accountable. Second, the farmers are&#13;
expected to pay for an increasing share of the PASDF and the operation and maintenance of the rural&#13;
information centers.&#13;
7.    Implications on govemment spending and farmers' contribution. Proposed support for Estonian&#13;
advisory services is important, but limited, both in time and in scope. The Private Advisory Services&#13;
Development Fund requires only an initial investment, because the farmers are expected to take over those&#13;
programs over time. The Rural Information Centers will be partially self-financing over time, and only&#13;
minimal public spending will be needed. The public extension service will remain a government&#13;
investment in human resources, resulting in increased income and increased rural welfare. Chances to&#13;
sustainably fund the public extension services are high, because of the important reduction in county-level&#13;
field staff (from 6-7 per county to about 3-4).&#13;
The Private Advisory Services Development Fund (PASDF)&#13;
8.    This fund has the dual purpose of creating and developing demand for advisory services among&#13;
the most viable farmers who are willing and able to pay for services; and creating competition among&#13;
advisors to enhance their responsiveness to clients' needs. The program will be introduced in stages: a&#13;
simple, limited pilot phase to start with, and a mainstreamed, more elaborated phase later on. It is&#13;
estimated that about 3,000 farmers will need "private" advice, put it to effective use, and be willing and&#13;
able to pay for it. It is planned that each eligible farmer would receive a grant from the PASDF of 2,000&#13;
EEK in 1996, which would cover a comprehensive business plan and ten to twenty visits a year. The&#13;
Government would decrease the level of the annual grant and phase out the grant payment over 8 years.&#13;
Assuming that one private advisor would have about 30 clients, his or her gross income from this scheme&#13;
would be about 66,000 EEK, including the 200 EEK contribution of each farmer (in 1996). Such income&#13;
would allow for a monthly income of 2,500 EEK and an annual operational budget that would include&#13;
transport and communications of about 30,000 EEK. Over the 5-year Project period the mission estimates&#13;
that the services of about 100 to 170 full-time equivalent advisors would be funded by PASDF.&#13;
9.    In the pilot phase (1995-1996), funds from the budget, managed by the MOA, will be transferred&#13;
from the MOA to the counties, based on shares of arable land. A county level steering committee will:&#13;
(a)   set criteria for fanner eligibility. Many counties will apply one or two simple criteria&#13;
for eligibility, like 10 hectares of land, or 15 milking cows, for instance&#13;
(b)   inform farmers. Using direct mailing, public meetings and mass media carnpaigns, the&#13;
county extension service will make the farmers in the county aware of the program, and&#13;
of the exact procedures for them to follow in order to benefit from the program. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 3&#13;
Page 4 of 18&#13;
particular, the county office, overseen by the steering committee, will: (i) inform the&#13;
public at large of the program; (ii) invite eligible farmers to apply; (iii) register applicants;&#13;
(iv) provide the applicants with a draft contract between the farmer(s) and the advisor(s)&#13;
(c)     oversee payment of advisors upon satisfactory completion of advisory services, as agreed&#13;
in the contract between farmer(s) and advisor(s).&#13;
The county-level steering committee would have one representative from the Farmers' Union, one from&#13;
the Producers' Union, and one from the county extension service, and when formed, the heads of the&#13;
LWAs in that county.&#13;

10.    The farmers' responsibilities would be spelled out clearly during the public awareness carnpaign,&#13;
and include:&#13;
(a)     formulate demand for advice&#13;
(b)     apply for PASDF to the county&#13;
(c)     choose advisor(s)&#13;
(d)     sign contract with advisor, including a mutually agreed plan of action and&#13;
payment details&#13;
(e)     pay 10 % of advisor's fee in 1996, 15%  in 1997, 25%  in 1998, 25%  in 1999,&#13;
30% in 2000, 40% in 2001, and a higher share thereafter.&#13;
(d)     sign contract again, for delivery of advisory services&#13;
11.    The private advisors' responsibilities would be to:&#13;
(a)     advertize his or her availability, skills, particular interests&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 3&#13;
Page 5 of 18&#13;
(b)    sign contract with farner(s) that clearly spells out the type of advice to be given,&#13;
and the expected results of adopted advice&#13;
(c)    deliver advice as agreed&#13;
(d)    present contract, with farmers' signature for completion of advisory services to&#13;
county extension office&#13;
(e)   receive payment&#13;
12.   After the initial pilot phase in 1995-1996, a number of refinements will be made, depending on&#13;
experiences gained. They includes:&#13;
(a)    an increase in the amount to be distributed, to enable in a one-year period, a&#13;
business development plan to be developed, and a minimum of ten to twenty&#13;
farmn visits to be made;&#13;
(b)    a gradual decrease in public funding, to reach zero in 8 years' time, when farmers&#13;
are expected to pay for "private" information themselves (see Table 1);&#13;
(c)    a distribution of funds among counties, based on actual demand, rather than&#13;
simple hectarage;&#13;
(d)    a more elaborate set of eligibility criteria, based on a transparent system of&#13;
economic viability of the individual farm, using a simple points system that gives&#13;
weighted values for the major farm assets, under the prevailing market conditions;&#13;
(e)    a form of registration and quality control of the individual advisors, based on&#13;
farmer opinion and industry initiatives: associations of advisors of proven quality&#13;
would be provided with incentives that would be channeled through, and&#13;
controlled by, the farmers;&#13;
(f)   the training needs of the advisors will be assessed upon completion of the pilot&#13;
phase. A comprehensive training program among private advisors, possibly&#13;
combined with a government certification procedure, will be started on the basis&#13;
of skillgap analysis. Both the skillgap analysis and the advisor training will be&#13;
supported by the Project;&#13;
(g)    a more representative, elected steering committee.&#13;
13.   The National Agricultural Extension Task Force has a major role to play in operationalizing the&#13;
PASDF. The NAETF, through the staff of the MOA, will:&#13;
(a)   train the county extension staff;&#13;
(b)    oversee and encourage the development of extension tools, including simple&#13;
computer software to assist farmers' cost/benefit analyses;&#13;
(c)    assist in the election of the steering committee;&#13;
(d)   train the county steering committees, including PASDF procedures, registration&#13;
of private advisors, examples of successes of extension, Public Relations and&#13;
public awareness campaigning.&#13;
Public Extension Improvement&#13;
14.   Publicly funded extension is ongoing in Estonia, but needs to be more demand driven, held more&#13;
accountable by the farmers, make better use of the potential of existing resources and media, and work&#13;
towards clearly defined and monitorable goals. The project aims to support the public extension through:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 3&#13;
Page 6 of 18&#13;
(a)    simple, practical country extension inventories, providing minimum information who the&#13;
farmers are: in terms of farming systems, trends in crop and animal yields, numbers and&#13;
types of farmers, gender, part- or full-time, alternative income, age distribution. This&#13;
information is presently fragmented or unavailable. The Project would provide training&#13;
for staff to draft a simple, 1 -2 page questionnaire, and incremental operational funds for&#13;
2 staff in each county (one from the county office, one from the Farmers' Union) to&#13;
carry out the inventory during 2 -3 weeks, and update it twice during the life of the&#13;
project, during 1 week each. Office supplies have also foreseen, to present the findings,&#13;
including simple maps of farming systems, in an attractive manner.&#13;
(b)   the use of rapid, participatory assessment (PRA) techniques to build consensus among&#13;
farmers, researchers and extension staff on priorities for extension programs. The Project&#13;
would provide training of staff in PRA techniques, incremental operation funds to carry&#13;
out one assessment in each of the 15 counties by 6 persons (representing county office,&#13;
Farmers' Union, Producers' Union, research, agri-business) during 3-4 weeks, to be&#13;
repeated once after two years. In addition, the Project foresees 2 staff months of Technical&#13;
Assistance to train selected staff in the use of PRA techniques, optimizing present&#13;
techniques to build consensus among all major stakeholders. The expected output of the&#13;
assessments would be a plan of action for the advisory services. Fanner needs would not&#13;
be limited to production techniques, but also include needs for business skills, tactical&#13;
advice and organizational aspects of farmer associations or commodity groups.&#13;
(c)    more coordinated production of extension materials, reducing present overlapping&#13;
initiatives, while improving the quality and uptake by farmers. The project would support&#13;
development and production of extension materials, training of staff and farmers, the&#13;
development of extension tools, including simple farm management software packages.&#13;
In addition, the MOA in the context of the Project would support incremental operational&#13;
funding.&#13;
(d)    more efficient diffusion, through the training of extension advisors, and the use of the&#13;
electronic and printed media. The Project foresees support for printing, diffusion on radio&#13;
and television of relevant programs, training of trainers, study tours, and incremental&#13;
operational funding.&#13;
(e)    more effective impact monitoring, through the use of agreed upon performance&#13;
indicators. The Project would support training and incremental operational funds to&#13;
collect, analyze, present and put to practical use, the findings, based on the performance&#13;
indicators. For a comprehensive list of indicators, see Section IV of this project&#13;
implementation plan.&#13;
The Rural Information Centers&#13;
15.   The government is supporting rural business centers that aim at the most dynamic and risk taking&#13;
segment of the rural population. The Government aims to expand the scope of these business centers to&#13;
include information on alternative employment and other legal and economic advice, that specifically aims&#13;
to ease the transition out of fanning. The concept for the centers was inspired by the Scandinavian&#13;
&#13;

telecottage model. The first telecottage opened in 1985 in Sweden. The following basic services are&#13;
provided:&#13;
(a)    information services: access to regional, national and international databases;&#13;
(b)    data-processing services: access to computers with a selection of programs;&#13;
(c)    IT consultancies: the telecottage management is undertaken by an "IT caretaker", who&#13;
also assists local businesses and organizations;&#13;
(d)    distance working: providing workstations for distance working;&#13;
(e)    education: open university type and online tutorials;&#13;
(f)    telecommunications: fax, e-mail, etc.;&#13;
(g)    village hall facilities: rooms and facilities for meetings, information.&#13;
The project would support modest funding to provide equipment and support the development of training&#13;
material. This initiative would require complementary technical assistance to assist in organizing these&#13;
centers as joint-stock companies, initially with the local municipality as the major shareholder and&#13;
progressively increasing the share of private ownership in subsequent years. The EU Phare program has&#13;
been planned to include this type of technical assistance for a duration of at least a year. Also, GOE&#13;
foresees expansion of the present advisory services with information on alternative rural employment, legal&#13;
matters, and other information that specifically aims to ease the transition out of farming.&#13;
Support to the National Agricultural Extension Task Force (NAETF)&#13;
16.    The NAETF plays a crucial role in the development of the Estonian advisory services. In&#13;
particular, the NAETF will:&#13;
(a)    coordinate and facilitate the development of the private advisory services through training&#13;
of staff, setting of criteria of farmer eligibility, preparing model and standardized&#13;
contracts, for instance;&#13;
(b)    contract selected extension products, like brochures, training programs, media productions,&#13;
through assistance in writing technical specifications, selection, negotiations, setting&#13;
indicators for performance;&#13;
(c)    inform policy makers on effects of policies at farm level, and of farmer appreciation of&#13;
public extension services;&#13;
(d)    facilitate linkages between extension and research; and&#13;
(e)    promote extension through improved public relations.&#13;
17.    Under the project, the NAETF's capacity to contract specific extension tasks, including writing&#13;
TORs, negotiating contracts and monitoring performance, will be strengthened through vehicles&#13;
redeployment, equipment, training, and technical assistance. The NAETF would benefit from substantial&#13;
assistance from an EU (Phare) supported program for at least one year. Currently, the NAETF receives&#13;
technical assistance (EU (Phare)) to develop the operation of the Private Advisory Services Development&#13;
Fund. This includes the preparation of pre-qualification criteria for agricultural advisors and the&#13;
preparation of standardized contracts for advisors and farmers. The County Extension officers will be&#13;

19.    PASDF will reimburse farmers for each annual agricultural advisory contract up to a limit of EEK&#13;
2000. The Bank will disburse 80% of the payments by PASDF for advisory services to fanners and the&#13;
Government will contribute the remaining 20%. Farners will pay at least 10% of the total contract value&#13;
in 1996 (estimated at EEK 2200) and over time, as the farmer's contribution to the advisory costs&#13;
increases, the proportion of grants paid per contract decreases.&#13;
I       Detailed costs are presented in Table I of Annex 7, and disbursement aspects described in Section 11 (G) of the Staff&#13;

II. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
A. Organizations Responsible for the Component&#13;
20.   MOA has decided not to do extension, but to get it done; and it should not favor any one advisory&#13;
service, but provide a level, competitive platform. The MOA has created a NAETF to manage the&#13;
development of advisory services and to redefine the Ministry's own role in extension. The NAETF is&#13;
responsible to an advisory council, with a maioritY representation of farmers, and in which research, the&#13;
University and colleges, the processors, input suppliers, commercial banks and the media are represented.&#13;
The advisory council would meet about twice a year and sets policy guidelines for the NAETF. This&#13;
NAETF will be expanded under the Project by relocating underutilized county staff, to become a group&#13;
of extension specialists, temporarily housed in the MOA, pending the privatization of the NAETF. Such&#13;
privatization of the NAETF would: (a) stimulate more farner participation, commitment and ownership&#13;
in design, implementation and monitoring of extension; (b) better integrate research, education and&#13;
extension; and (c) develop funding mechanisms for extension from alternative sources, including levies&#13;
on produce, farmer subscriptions and fees, and land taxes to cover part of the public extension&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
21.   MOA, through the NAETF, will establish and supervise the PASDF and appoint a manager. The&#13;
NAETF would prepare and finalize the operating policies of PASDF, prepare a standardized contract&#13;
format for contracts between advisors and farmers, and the selection criteria for the agricultural advisors.&#13;
For these purposes, MOA is receiving Technical Assistance from EU (Phare).&#13;
22.   The Project Implementation Unit (PIU)2 will assist the NAETF in implementation aspects related&#13;
to procurement, loan disbursement, accounting, monitoring and evaluation, as well as administrative&#13;
support.&#13;
B. Agreements between Borrower and Implementing Agencies&#13;
23.   Agreements relevant to this component to be reached at negotiations between the Borrower and&#13;
the implementing agencies under the MOA are as follows:&#13;
(a)    The GOE will provide sufficient funding to the MOA, including its NAETF, to cover&#13;
incremental operating costs associated with this project component. These costs cover&#13;
expenses for field trips, meetings and planning workshops, accommodation and per diems,&#13;
administration, logistics and other operational requirements to support the implementation&#13;
of the advisory services project component.&#13;
(b)    That by effectiveness, MOA will have appointed all the staff and members of the NAETF&#13;
to ensure adequate participation and consultation and establish county-level steering&#13;
committees, all with TORs, and to the satisfaction of the Bank.&#13;
(c)    As a condition of disbursement, the Borrower will present to the Bank a standardized&#13;
contract format for agricultural advisory services, and the selection criteria for&#13;
2     Terms of reference of the PIU are-presented in Annex 5. This PIU reports to the Inter-Ministerial Project Steering&#13;
Committee.&#13;

agricultural advisors to be eligible for PASDF, both satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
(d)    By March 30, 1996, MOA would establish the PASDF and appoint the manager of&#13;
PASDF under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
C. Role of the Bank During Supervision&#13;
24.   The advisory services component will be supervised by Bank personnel (or designated consultants)&#13;
in accordance with the proposed supervision plan summarized in Section III (F) of the Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report.&#13;
m. Implementation Plan&#13;
A. Timebound Schedules&#13;
25.   Key timing for major and key activities of this component are as indicated in the procurement&#13;
plan, as shown in Table 3. The NAETF, once fully in place, will prepare a detailed operational plan&#13;
annually, indicating detailed steps and processes involved, including the various consultations required for&#13;
coordinating and implementing the overall activities.&#13;
B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule&#13;
26.   For all items funded through the loan proceeds, GOE agrees that: (a) it would apply procurement&#13;
procedures which are consistent with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits (January, 1995), and Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency (August, 1981) for procurement of Bank-financed goods and consultant's&#13;
services. Procurement of technical assistance, equipment, and consultants for various studies under parallel&#13;
co-financing arrangements would be carried out through tied procurement in accordance with procurement&#13;
regulations of the respective donor countries and the European Union. Table 2 summarizes the major&#13;
procurement packages of this component and their schedules. Procurement for Bank-financed activities&#13;
would be undertaken in the manner as described below:&#13;
(a)    Equipment-including materials (US $0.17 million). Procedures for International&#13;
Shopping (IS) and National Shopping (?NS) would be used for procurement of contracts&#13;
valued below US $300,000 and US $50,000 respectively. For IS, at least three quotations&#13;
would have to be obtained from two countries. NS procedures would be used for&#13;
procurement of office equipment and furniture. Contracts awarded under NS procedures&#13;
would be based on comparing price quotations from at least three suppliers.&#13;
(b)    Training (US $0.04 million). Consultants would be contracted to deliver training in&#13;
Participatory Rural Appraisal techniques. Hiring of these consultants would be in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August, 1981).&#13;
(c)    Studies (US $0.32 million). The Project would finance studies for agricultural advisory&#13;
services. Contracts are estimated to be small in size, for both extension material&#13;
development and distribution, and studies related to skill gap analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 3&#13;
Page 11 of 18&#13;
(d)     Agricultural Advisory Services (US $3.3 million).3  The Bank would partly finance the&#13;
employment of consultants (local and possibly some foreign experts) in connection with&#13;
the provision of private advisory services for priority programs on agricultural extension.&#13;
The beneficiaries of the agricultural advisory services would directly procure their own&#13;
private advisors using a standardized contract acceptable to the Bank. It is estimated that&#13;
about 2,800 annual advisory contracts would be submitted for reimbursement.&#13;

IV. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
27.   A hierarchy of extension indicators will be used under the Project:&#13;
Input indicators&#13;
*     Inputs: Materials bought, equipment installed&#13;
Output indicators&#13;
Activities: Number of visits, meetings, demonstrations&#13;
Involvement: Farmers in contact with extension&#13;
Number of contracts financed through PASDF&#13;
Impact indicators&#13;
Opinion: Farmers giving opinion on extension's usefulness&#13;
IKnowledge Change: Changes in knowledge, attitudes and skills&#13;
Practice Change: Farmers adopting improved agricultural practices&#13;
Results: Changes in the standard of living of farmers&#13;
System Maintenance: Sustainability of advisory services&#13;
28.   The specific indicators will be developed by the NAETF with the assistance of the PIU's M&amp;E&#13;
specialist. The NAETF would be responsible for the collection and analysis of M&amp;E data.&#13;
Prerequisites&#13;
29.   To make indicators work, by making continuous and meaningful adjustments in content and&#13;
method of the advisory services, three prerequisites must be considered. First, the different categories&#13;
of farmers, with their farming systems, their constraints and their opportunities, must be known and&#13;
understood well. This requires the detailed assessment, described above. Second, on the basis of this&#13;
needs assessment, objectives need to be formulated in a participatory manner. Objectives should be&#13;
formulated in terms of changed behavior of different target groups, by the different target groups. Third,&#13;
extension managers must have the necessary technical and methodological knowledge and skills to make&#13;
it work.&#13;

ESTONIA&#13;
AGRICULTURE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
FOOD QUALITY CONTROL AND VETERINARY LABORATORY COMPONENT&#13;
1. The Component&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
1.    The objective of the project component is to improve food quality and livestock quality standards&#13;
to protect consumers and increase exports of food and livestock products. The project would support: (a)&#13;
improvement of the National Veterinary Control Laboratory to control the quality livestock products and&#13;
foodstuffs of animal origin for domestic and export markets; and (b) training for the operations of the food&#13;
quality and veterinary control facility. The project would therefore provide Bank financing for the&#13;
purchase of modem laboratory equipment and instruments and the necessary training for the State&#13;
Veterinary Department in connection with the acquisition of this equipment, with specific objectives to:&#13;
(a)   set up a national program for the monitoring of contaminants and harmful residues in&#13;
animal products and foodstuffs of animal origin;&#13;
(b)   improve veterinary control of infectious diseases, and ultimately the health safety features&#13;
of foodstuffs of animal origin, in order to penetrate export markets and protect the health&#13;
of foreign and domestic consumers.&#13;
2.    This component are complemented by donor-funded parallel projects (partly ongoing) which&#13;
provide technical assistance and training programs for developing food legislation, and institutional&#13;
strengthening for the establishment and operations of modem food quality control facilities.&#13;
B. Component Description&#13;
Background&#13;
3.    Currently, GOE plans to ensure rapid establishment of internationally accepted food quality control&#13;
and standards in Estonia to meet both intemational and EU standards. At present, existing facilities are&#13;
inadequately equipped. The State Veterinary Department depends on foreign laboratories for certain tests&#13;
on residues and contamination. Since these tests must be taken at regular and frequent intervals, and&#13;
results made available quickly for regular monitoring, the present situation is a constraint to the&#13;
development of the local meat and food industry. Although Estonia has received export quotas and&#13;
preferential tariff reductions on a number of food and animal products, because of the lack of&#13;
internationally required food testing capability, export markets to EU countries remain inaccessible.&#13;
4.    Legal Aspects. The State Veterinary Department is an independent unit under the administration&#13;
of the Ministry of Agriculture. While the organization of the veterinary service and veterinary control is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 4&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
prescribed in the Law on Veterinary Service, the Food Law specifies that the control of the quality of&#13;
foodstuffs is conducted by several agencies including the National Grain Board, the State Veterinary&#13;
Department, the National Health Board, the National Board on Standards, and National Customs. In&#13;
accordance with the present rules prescribed under the Law on Veterinary Service, veterinary control&#13;
covers aspects related to the quality of meat, meat products, milk, milk products, eggs, fish, honey and&#13;
bee products, raw hides, wool and feather. Given the importance of the livestock sub-sector, this mandate&#13;
represents a critical support to the overall development of the sub-sector.&#13;
5.    Organization and Functions. The existing network of veterinary control consists of 15 County&#13;
Laboratories and the National Veterinary Control Laboratory. County Laboratories are mandated to carry&#13;
out basic biochemical, microbiological and serological tests to diagnose diseases, primarily of livestock,&#13;
fowl and fish. These laboratories also establish the quality of animal products and foodstuffs of animal&#13;
origin by means of chemical and microbiological analyses. Furthermore, the Veterinary Control&#13;
Laboratory is mandated with the following main functions:&#13;
(a)   full diagnostic examinations of animal, poultry, fish and bee diseases;&#13;
(b)    chemical, physical, microbiological, organoleptic and toxicological analyses of animal&#13;
products and foodstuffs of animal origin, feed and feed components, including evaluation&#13;
of their quality on the basis of these analyses;&#13;
(c)    methodological guidance on diagnostics and procurement of relevant diagnostics supplies&#13;
for County Laboratories;&#13;
(d)    examination and analysis of epizootological situation.&#13;
6.    Present Constraints.  To date, the present quality of animal products and foodstuffs of animal&#13;
origin is assessed to a large extent on the methods prescribed under the GOST system of the former Soviet&#13;
Union. Chemical and biological quality standards have been introduced in recent years in Estonia for&#13;
milk, milk products and meat products. However, in a transition economy and as Estonia pursues an open&#13;
market system, present standards need to be aligned with internationally accepted standards, including&#13;
methods for establishing and monitoring compliance of these standards. For example, in the context of&#13;
the trade agreement between Estonia and the European Union, EU standards require that for Estonian&#13;
exports of animal products and foodstuffs into the EU, the content of various contaminants and potentially&#13;
harmful residues must be ascertained. In addition, a program for monitoring and evaluation of these&#13;
contaminants must be established and institutionalized in Estonia. Present facilities and their personnel&#13;
are not equipped and trained to meet these international requirements. A number of guidelines will need&#13;
to be established, especially those concerning: (a) the use of veterinary medicines; (b) instructions for&#13;
testing animal products and foodstuffs of animal origin; (c) a system for sampling and transportation of&#13;
samples; (d) a list of contaminants, their descriptions and methods for establishing their occurrence; and&#13;
(e) instructions for dealing with cases where established limits for contaminants are exceeded.&#13;
7.    Inaccessible Markets. As a result of the present inadequacy of the State Veterinary Department&#13;
to meet the food quality testing requirements of the EU, potential export markets for certain products&#13;
covered under the trade agreement cannot be realized. Although, the food quality of certain products&#13;
would meet the EU standards, Estonia lacks the means of verifying this claim to serve as legal proof of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

evidence. Potential market opportunities include 60% tariff reductions on agricultural products shown in&#13;

8.    The project provides funding for the acquisition of modern laboratory equipment for the&#13;
improvement and development of the National Veterinary Control Laboratory, to support the main&#13;
functions of this laboratory, particularly in the area of testing and control of contaminants and residues,&#13;
as well as the diagnosis of diseases. This acquisition would be packaged to include major items as shown&#13;
indicatively below:&#13;
(i)    Atomic absorption spectrometer&#13;
(ii)   Gas chromatograph&#13;
(iii)   Microwave for sample preparation&#13;
(iv)   Somatic sample counters&#13;

9.    A complete list of equipment will be compiled by the end of 1995, and their specifications&#13;
prepared. Although an indicative list of equipment has been prepared, this list will require some updating&#13;
to fit with actual requirements, taking into consideration the inventory of availability and condition of&#13;
some of this equipment.&#13;
Training&#13;
10.   In the context of the planned acquisition of new and modem equipment, the project will provide&#13;
funding for training the staff, technicians and scientists of the National Veterinary Control Laboratory for&#13;
the operations and maintenance of the equipment. Training on modem methods for detecting and&#13;
measuring contaminants and residues are planned for about 6 persons for a duration of up to 3 months&#13;
each. It is anticipated that the overall training program will be spread out over a year, and scheduled&#13;
appropriately in line with the schedule of deliveries of the new equipment.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
11.   Parallel projects already committed and funded separately by bilateral sources include: (a)&#13;
assistance from Denmark (Danish Ministry of Agriculture) for developing the legislative framework for&#13;
the quality of animal products; and (b) assistance from Finland for the development of monitoring and&#13;
evaluation procedures related to food quality control and testing.&#13;

B. Agreements between Borrower and Implementing Agencies&#13;
15.   Agreements to be reached at negotiations between the Borrower and the implementing agencies&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
(a)    The GOE will provide sufficient funding to the State Veterinary Department and the&#13;
National Veterinary Laboratory to cover incremental operating costs associated with this&#13;
project component. These costs include expenses for administration, operations and&#13;
maintenance, and adequate staffing.&#13;
C. Role of the Bank During Supervision&#13;
16.   The food quality control and veterinary laboratory component will be supervised by Bank&#13;
personnel (or designated consultants) in accordance with the proposed supervision plan summarized in&#13;
Section III (F) of the Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
III. Implementation Plan&#13;
A. Timebound Schedules&#13;
17.   This project component, consisting of equipment acquisition and related training, is intended to&#13;
be completed under the loan within a period of one year, and no later than 18 months from the project&#13;
start-up date. Schedules of events under parallel donor activities are determined separately by individual&#13;
donors. Basically, timelines to be monitored, are those relating to procurement packages described below,&#13;
with timing shown in Table 2.&#13;
B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule&#13;
18.   For all items funded through the loan proceeds, GOE agrees that: (a) it would apply procurement&#13;
procedures which are consistent with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits (January, 1995), and Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as ExecutingAgency (August, 1981) for procurement of Bank-financed goods and consultant's&#13;
services, and (b) that progress reports prepared by Government would include monitoring of the&#13;
procurement process of the various aggregate amounts and ceilings. Procurement of technical assistance,&#13;
equipment, and consultants for various studies under parallel co-financing arrangements would be carried&#13;
out through tied procurement in accordance with procurement regulations of the respective donor&#13;
countries. Table 2 summarizes the major procurement packages of this component and their schedules.&#13;
Procurement for Bank-financed activities would be undertaken in the manner as described below:&#13;
(a)   Equipment (US $1.1 million). Laboratory equipment would be procured in two or three&#13;
packages in accordance with International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures of the&#13;
World Bank. When appropriate, the entire equipment would be grouped into a package&#13;
to save administrative costs and gain benefits from economy of scale. The Borrower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PIP 4&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
would use Bank's Standard Bidding Documents as applicable. The application of domestic&#13;
preferences would be in accordance with the requirements under Appendix 2 of the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines. for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995),&#13;
and expressed clearly in the bidding documents for goods.&#13;
(b)     Training (US $0.2 million). Consultants would be contracted to carry out the training&#13;
program as identified under the project. Hiring of consultants would be in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency (August, 1981).&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Agriculture Project's
            objectives are to increase rural incomes and stimulate the
            rural economy through rural entrepreneurship. To achieve
            these objectives, the project focuses on improving factor
            productivity and competitiveness of agricultural products by
            providing assistance for the: a) privatization of rural
            lands; b) privatization and rehabilitation of select rural
            infrastructure; and c) improvement of human resources skills
            for entrepreneurship in rural areas; d) introduction of new
            farming technologies consistent with transformed private
            agriculture; and e) improvement in food quality. Project
            components include: i) land reform which includes national
            geodetic network; cadastral surveying; and state-owned rural
            lands disposal policy and institutional strengthening; ii)
            farm drainage rehabilitation; iii) land use management; iv)
            agricultural advisory services; v) food quality control and
            veterinary laboratory; and vi) project management.
