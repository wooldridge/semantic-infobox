1. PROJECT AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.1   Land and Population. The two provinces of West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) and&#13;
East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) cover a land area of about 68,000 sq.km, spanning the double&#13;
chain of islands extending eastward from Bali: on the north, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores&#13;
and Alor and on the south, Sumba and Timor. According to the 1990 Census, the total&#13;
population of NTB was 3.4 million and NTT 3.3 million, unevenly distributed among the&#13;
islands. Lombok with 500 inhabitants/sq.km has the highest population density&#13;
approximating Java, while East Sumba only has about 22 persons/sq.km. The population&#13;
of both provinces expanded in the 1980s: NTT 1.8 percent and NTB 2.15 percent per&#13;
year, compared to the national average growth rate of 2.0 percent per year during the&#13;
period. However, analysis of migration data indicate that NTT and NTB have recently&#13;
been losing population through out-migration. The population is predominantly rural: 83&#13;
percent in NTB and 89 percent in NTT. There is a high level of cultural diversity among&#13;
the inhabitants of Nusa Tenggara. In NTB the major ethnic and language groups are the&#13;
Sasaks of Lombok and the people of Sumbawa who lived under the Sultanates of&#13;
Sumbawa and Bima/Dompu with minority settlers from South Sulawesi, Buton and Bali.&#13;
In NTT, the main ethnic groups are the Timorese, descendants of several kingdoms on the&#13;
islands of Sumba and Flores, and the ethnic groups of the smaller islands, including Roti&#13;
and Savu. Geographical and ethnic fragmentation has tended to evolve different&#13;
agricultural technologies, suited to the ecological niches which they inhabit. Political&#13;
traditions also are fragmented, with some areas having a feudal system (Lombok and&#13;
Timor), others having absolute monarchies and slaveholding (Sumba), while others have a&#13;
more democratic clan or tribal organization whose nobility is to be "first among equals"&#13;
(Flores).&#13;
1.2   Nusa Tenggara is Poor. Among the twenty-seven provinces in Indonesia, NTT&#13;
has the lowest GRDP per capita (about Rp 400,000 p.a.) while NTB (Rp 450,000 p.a.)&#13;
ranks third from the lowest. The percentages of inhabitants below the poverty line are 23&#13;
percent for NTB and 24 percent for NTT placing both provinces significantly poorer than&#13;
the national average of 15 percent. In NTB some 63 percent of the population had&#13;
monthly levels of expenditures below Rp 20,000 and in NTT - 69 percent of the&#13;
population. The national average is 45 percent. Other welfare indicators show that:&#13;
(a)   NTB has the lowest life expectancy of all provinces of Indonesia while&#13;
NTT also is below the national average;&#13;
(b)   infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births in NTB of 145 is the highest in&#13;
the country, compared with 77 in NTT and the national average of 71;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
(c)   malnutrition rate is among the highest in Indonesia: the incidence of&#13;
moderate and severe protein energy malnutrition (PEM) in the rural areas&#13;
where most of the people live is about 16 percent; and&#13;
(d)   illiteracy rates in the rural areas of 48 percent in NTB and 24 percent in&#13;
NTT are significantly higher than in the urban areas and in Indonesia as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
Macroeconomic Background&#13;
1.3   GRDP Growth and Sectoral Distribution. Available data point to a widening&#13;
gap in income and welfare indicators between Indonesia's eastern islands and the rest of&#13;
the country, more especially Java.' GDP of both provinces has grown quite steadily over&#13;
the last decade: 6.8 percent in NTB and 5.2 percent in NTT from 1983 to 1991. This&#13;
compares to an average GDP growth rate of 6.6 percent for Indonesia and 7.4 percent for&#13;
Java. Over the period 1983-199 1, the structure of the regional economy has changed very&#13;
little. Although its share in GRDP decreased slightly in the two provinces, agriculture&#13;
remains the dominant sector in the two provinces contributing almost half of the regional&#13;
output. This is more than double the 20 percent average contribution of agriculture to&#13;
national GDP. In both provinces, agriculture was the major source of growth in the&#13;
economy with 43 percent and 36 percent of GRDP in NTB and NTT, respectively. Other&#13;
sectors with significant contributions to GRDP were trade hotel and restaurant-16 percent&#13;
for both NTB and NTT, and government services-1O percent and 13 percent, respectively&#13;
for NTB and NTT. Industry accounted for a relatively insignificant share of less than 3&#13;
percent of the regional economy in both provinces. The sectoral distribution of the labor&#13;
force shows the agricultural sector still as the dominant sector employing 81 percent of the&#13;
work force in NTT and 59 percent in NTB. Industry has contributed minimally to&#13;
provincial employment, with an average of 9 percent in NTB and 7 percent in NTT. A&#13;
striking characteristic of the labor force pattern in NTT is that only 14 percent is engaged&#13;
in trade and services compared to 32 percent in NTB and 36 percent in the whole country.&#13;
1.4   Exports. Direct foreign exports from NTB and NTT in 1991 amounted to&#13;
US$8.8 million and US$11.4 million, respectively. For NTB, fishery products comprised&#13;
two-thirds of the exports, i.e., US$6.0 million worth of pearls, seaweed, shrimp and sea&#13;
cucumber. Agricultural exports, primarily cashew and spices, amounted to US$1.7 million&#13;
and pumice stones about US$1.1 million. NTT's primary exports were US$6.7 million&#13;
worth of cocoa, cashew and vanilla, US$3.1 million of sandalwood, and US$1.4 million&#13;
of pearls, tuna, and fish oil. Exports accounted for less than 2 percent of total GDP in the&#13;
two provinces.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

The Agricultural Sector&#13;
1.5   The 5.9 percent growth of the agricultural sector in NTB was almost double the&#13;
national average of 3.1 percent, while NTT's agricultural growth rate of 3.5 percent still&#13;
exceeded the national average. The food crop subsector made up the largest share of&#13;
regional agricultural GDP: 66 percent in NTB and 57 percent in NTT. The second most&#13;
important subsector was livestock, which accounted for 15 percent and 23 percent of&#13;
agriculture GRDP of NTB and NTT, respectively. Fisheries, the only other significant&#13;
subsector, contributed 11 and 9 percent to the agricultural economy in NTB and NTT,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
1.6   The food crop subsector in NTB grew at a rate of 5.4 percent during 1984-91, or&#13;
more than double the rate of growth of 2.6 percent achieved by the subsector in NTT.&#13;
The main food crop in NTB is paddy (240,000 ha), while in NTT maize is more widely&#13;
planted (200,000 ha) and paddy is the second most commonly planted crop (180,000 ha).&#13;
Production of legume food crops as cash crops (soybeans, mungbeans and peanuts), and&#13;
also that of red onions and garlic, has been increasing in economic importance, especially&#13;
in NTB. Harvesting of fruits from backyard gardens is common but in most areas not yet&#13;
commercialized.&#13;
1.7   During the period 1984 to 1991 the livestock subsectors of NTB and NTT grew at&#13;
an average annual rate of 5.4 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. Economically, cattle&#13;
are the most important large livestock in the region and ownership of cattle brings a high&#13;
level of status among the rural people. Nusa Tenggara supplies slaughter cattle to&#13;
Indonesia's urban centers and has also been a major source of breeding cattle for other&#13;
provinces. Ownership of cattle is concentrated among the higher income rural households&#13;
and extensive range management systems prevail in many areas. In NTT the cattle&#13;
population has been stagnating in recent years due to increased off-take of breeding cows&#13;
for development projects in other provinces, increased market demand for beef, and high&#13;
levels of calf mortality during the first year. Goats and chickens are widely owned in both&#13;
provinces. There now are some 250,000 goats in NTB and 450,000 in NTT. Several&#13;
LCOs are operating schemes to further expand goat keeping among the poorer segments&#13;
of the rural population. There are some 4.5 million chickens in each province. Chickens&#13;
are raised in the home gardens of almost every rural household. A typical farm family&#13;
owns approximately ten chickens which provide a significant portion of the family's annual&#13;
protein. Chickens can be maintained with a minimum of inputs, but they are subject to&#13;
Newcastle disease which periodically may cause death losses of up to 80 percent of the&#13;
flock in a village.&#13;
1.8   The estate crops subsector is relatively small in Nusa Tenggara and almost entirely&#13;
comprised of smallholder production. The subsector's contribution to agricultural GDRP&#13;
was 8 percent in NTB in 1991 and 10 percent in NTT. Coconut is by far the most widely&#13;
planted estate crop in both provinces (220,000 ha), followed by cashews (80,000 ha),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
coffee (55,000 ha) and cocoa (17,500 ha). Cocoa from NTT is the leading export&#13;
commodity of the region (US$5.3 million in 1991) and cashew exports are now increasing&#13;
in importance.&#13;
1.9   The fisheries subsector plays a significant role in the provincial economy of both&#13;
provinces and in the nutrition of the coastal populations. In NTB, the fisheries subsector&#13;
achieved an average annual growth rate of 9.2 percent during 1984-199 1. In NTT, the&#13;
average annual growth rate reported during 1984-1991 was 9.4 percent. Export of fishery&#13;
products from both provinces was significant in 1991 with fishery exports from NTB&#13;
reported as US$6.1 million and from NTT as US$1.4 million. Pearls were the leading&#13;
fishery commodity exported from both provinces. Although at present the annual catch&#13;
from the coastal zone appears to be significantly below sustainable yields, there are high&#13;
rates of exploitation in the narrow coastal zone where fishing efforts are concentrated and&#13;
fishing practices are environmentally destructive.&#13;
1.10  About 90 percent of farm families cultivate rice and/or secondary crops, and about&#13;
40 percent keep livestock. About 9 percent of households are dependent on the fisheries&#13;
subsector. Net annual incomes are low, ranging from about Rp 300,000 for a 0.75 ha&#13;
dryland farm to Rp 1.0 million per household for a 0.5 ha of village irrigated farm. Where&#13;
feasible, farmers establish simple irrigation systems based on existing surface and&#13;
groundwater (springs) resources. Relatively few farmers practice conservation farming&#13;
and intensive husbandry techniques except in areas targeted by the Nusa Tenggara&#13;
Agricultural Support Services Project (Loan 2638-IND) and other development projects&#13;
implemented in the two provinces (see Chapter 2). Many farmers continue to practice&#13;
shifting cultivation among several dryland plots in order to reduce production losses from&#13;
declining soil fertility. Routine farm management operations such as pruning, fertilization&#13;
and replanting with selected seedlings are not widely practiced as yet. Off-farm&#13;
employment opportunities are limited.&#13;
Constraints to Agricultural Area Development&#13;
1.11  Natural and Physical Factors. The most binding constraint to the development&#13;
of Nusa Tenggara is environmental: limited arable land, poor soils, aridity, fragmentation,&#13;
and remoteness. Only 20 percent and 16 percent of the land area in NTB and NTT,&#13;
respectively, is cultivated, mainly through upland and shifting cultivation. NTT has the&#13;
largest area of erosion prone land of all provinces in Indonesia with about 1.75 million ha&#13;
while NTB has nearly 300,000 ha. Data on land use show the relatively large areas in both&#13;
provinces that are under brush/scrubs, grasslands, shifting cultivation and upland&#13;
agriculture. Forest cover is only 21 percent in NTT and 48 percent in NTB. Degradation&#13;
of upland areas is a serious environmental concern. The soils of the northern arc of islands&#13;
comprising Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores and Alor are mainly of volcanic origin and have&#13;
acidic to slightly alkaline soils. The southern arc composed of Sumba, Sawu, Roti and&#13;
Timor were mainly formned from uplifted marine floor or coralline islands with generally&#13;
alkaline and occasionally sodic soils. Both volcanic and coralline soils are porous and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
prone to drought during the dry season. In addition, the climate of Nusa Tenggara is&#13;
harsh with some of the lowest rainfall amounts in the whole of Indonesia (as low as 500&#13;
mm in some coastal areas). The mountainous topography of the islands gives rise to a&#13;
diversity of mnicrocimates which affects crop production. Reliable rainfall is restricted to&#13;
the three months of December through February when over one-half of the annual&#13;
precipitation occurs. But even during these three months distribution can be uneven.&#13;
From the months of May to October, drought conditions frequently prevail which&#13;
sometimes result in food shortages. Conservation practices in the dryland farming&#13;
systems, through moisture retention during the dry season and erosion control during the&#13;
rains, are of critical importance to arrest resource degradation in the uplands.&#13;
1.12  Technology. In general, levels of productivity in the agricultural sector of Nusa&#13;
Tenggara are among the lowest in Indonesia. Almost all farmers rely on traditional&#13;
technologies to cultivate food crops for food security. The farming systems are&#13;
predominantly rainfed with extensive fallow periods due to the long dry seasons. Typical&#13;
yields for major food and estate crops are below the national averages due to climatic&#13;
disadvantages and also the absence of technology best suited to the conditions of the&#13;
region. In the case of cattle, improved intensive farmer management systems (provision of&#13;
improved legume fodder, drinking water, and improved veterinary services) could&#13;
significantly impact on growth of the livestock sector. In fisheries, future efforts are&#13;
required to promote research and extension on coastal marine culture of fish and seaweed.&#13;
1.13  Infrastructure. Transportation is a key constraint in remote regions such as Nusa&#13;
Tenggara. During the first long-term development period, the Government has given&#13;
special attention to this sector and considerable progress has been achieved in improving&#13;
infrastructure of the eastern islands. Among these, NTB has the largest percentage of&#13;
asphalted roads (60 percent) and NTT (23 percent) one of the lowest. In NTT there is&#13;
considerable scope to further improve local roads to provide all-weather access to more&#13;
areas. Within NTB and NTT, the less populated areas are generally those with less&#13;
developed village roads. Improvement of the network of local roads would reduce local&#13;
transport costs and improve the terms of trade for rural communities.&#13;
1.14 Policies and Incentives Affecting Investment and Trade. Indonesia has&#13;
recently been listed as one of five countries which had spectacular successes in agricultural&#13;
growth and rural poverty reduction based on favorable policies, strong development&#13;
institutions, and rapid technical change.2 Deregulation measures taken over the last decade&#13;
had a strongly positive effect on making the Indonesian economy more internationally&#13;
competitive at the national level. However, further reform of the trade and investment&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
regime in agriculture and agro-processing is necessary if Indonesia is to achieve the&#13;
agricultural growth targets that it has set itself in REPELITA VI.&#13;
1.15  A number of interventions exist at the regional and local levels in the trade of&#13;
agricultural products. Input supplies are provided by a mixture of private and public&#13;
sector sources, with few interventions. Often, interventions in agricultural product&#13;
markets are undertaken by provincial and kabupaten (district) level authorities in the belief&#13;
that government intervention is in the best interests of smallholders and local economies.&#13;
The restrictions tend to vary widely from one kabupaten to the other and can take several&#13;
forms, e.g. minimum prices, preference to cooperatives, marketing taxes, licensing&#13;
requirements, etc. These do not seem to have a major impact on trade. Furthermore,&#13;
Ministry of Home Affairs submitted an instruction to local authorities to refrain from&#13;
interventions affecting a number of key commercial crops (Keputusan Menteri Dalam&#13;
Negeri No. 48, 1984, amended by KEPMEN No. 29, 1986). The potentially most&#13;
stringent restrictions appear to exist in the livestock sector where the central government&#13;
uses a quota system to regulate inter-island movements of slaughter animals and breeding&#13;
cattle. The indications are that inspite of the resultant distortions, cattle raising is&#13;
profitable, given the interest and extent of the livestock business in NTT. The Bank has&#13;
initiated a dialogue on this issue with the Department of Livestock at the central&#13;
government level. Similar to the restrictions, local authorities can also levy taxes or&#13;
retributions on agricultural products for purposes of raising revenue. These levies in&#13;
general do not appear to be a major cost that would discourage local or inter-island trade&#13;
compared to transport costs. A more detailed discussion on policy and institutional&#13;
aspects of input and output markets in the province is provided in Annex 8.&#13;
1.16 Capital Constraint: Investments and Credit Availability. During the first&#13;
long-term development plan, the national budget was the largest single source of public&#13;
investments in the region. The greatest share of public investments in Nusa Tenggara has&#13;
been for the development of infrastructure and transportation. Although kabupaten&#13;
development funding has been increasing in recent years, average development&#13;
expenditures for agriculture and irrigafion amounted to only 3.2 percent of the total.&#13;
Domestic and foreign private investments on a per capita basis were lower in two&#13;
provinces than in other major regions of Indonesia. The value of foreign and domestic&#13;
investment projects in the two provinces is less than 1.0 percent of the national total.&#13;
Foreign investments in the eastem provinces have been concentrated in copper and gold&#13;
mining in Irian Jaya, and nickel mining in South Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi and&#13;
Maluku.&#13;
1.17 Banking and financial services contribute less than 2 percent of GRDP in Nusa&#13;
Tenggara. Most of the banking institutions are in Mataram and Kupang (the two&#13;
provincial capitals), but the rural areas are little served by the formal financial sector.&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Credit from informal moneylenders and relatives is widely available in the rural areas, but&#13;
this is used mostly for consumption purposes. As development programs and projects are&#13;
being decentralized, it becomes increasingly necessary to explore the prospects for&#13;
alternative forms of credit for farmers, herders and fishers, through formal or informal&#13;
systems. The ICR for the now completed NTASP concluded that in kind revolving credit&#13;
systems have the potential to reach beneficiaries effectively, and in some instances are&#13;
more attractive alternatives to smallholder credit than through financial intermediaries.4&#13;
Recent experience with informal revolving funds for annual farm inputs (seeds, fertilizers,&#13;
etc.) in Bank-financed upland and swamps development projects has been encouraging.&#13;
Training of community development facilitators in alternative farmer credit arrangements&#13;
has a high priority.&#13;
1.18  Institutions. Government services (defense and public administration) is the&#13;
second most important sector in NTT, contributing 16 percent of GRDP in 1991, and&#13;
third in NTB with a 10 percent share of GRDP. The levels of staffing of local government&#13;
agencies at both the provincial and kabupaten levels are sufficient. Within each agency&#13;
there is a nucleus of academically qualified specialists. However, agency staff in the&#13;
region tend to have low civil service ranks, limited experience, and are not accustomed to&#13;
taking initiative in planning and targeting development activities. The main problems cited&#13;
by the BAPPEDAs in planning for development in their provinces include the following:&#13;
(a)   limited staff capacity to carry out and coordinate systematic and&#13;
comprehensive development planning;&#13;
(b)   limitations in data base and survey information on the provinces' human&#13;
and physical resources and limited budgets to carry out the necessary&#13;
surveys; and&#13;
(c)   inadequate funds for training and operations.&#13;
1.19  Similar problems are evident at the kabupaten and kecamatan (sub-district) levels.&#13;
Dinas staff have had few opportunities for specialized short-term training. A large&#13;
segment of the staff of Dinas Food Crops Tk. II consists of extension workers (PPL). In&#13;
NTB, there are on average about 67 extension workers per kabupaten and in NTT only&#13;
33. Rural extension centers (REC) have not been well maintained and are not fully&#13;
utilized. The RECs were handed over in 1992 from the national level to the Dinas Tk. II.&#13;
All technical agencies suffer from lack of office facilities, field staff housing, training,&#13;
vehicles, field laboratories, extension equipment and materials.&#13;
1.20 In both NTB and NTT, there are a large numbers of local community&#13;
organizations (LCOs) based at the kecamatan and kabupaten levels. These LCOs are&#13;
usually organized by the community and religious leaders (Pesantren in NTB and Christian&#13;
4 Implenentation Completion Report for NTASP, June 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
institutions in NTT) and have broad memberships at the local level. The experience of&#13;
implementing rural development activities in cooperation with local LCOs under NTASP&#13;
and other projects has shown that they have the potential to increase the participation of&#13;
the community in the development activities. One notable characteristic in NTB and NTT&#13;
is the willingness of local governments to involve LCOs in their development activities.&#13;
This has considerably strengthened the cooperation between LCOs and local government&#13;
agencies to the benefit of the public.&#13;
Prospects for Development&#13;
1.21 Government's development objective for the eastern islands aims at arresting the&#13;
relative decline of some of the provinces vis-a-vis the rest of the country to increase social&#13;
equity and preserve unity.5 In the foreseeable future, agriculture will remain a key sector&#13;
in the strategy for the region's development, as spelled out in REPELITA VI. While&#13;
development of other sectors such as tourism is envisaged, agriculture is still the largest&#13;
single sector and employer. Broad-based income generation will therefore need to rely&#13;
first on agricultural intensification. The challenge is to raise subsistence production and&#13;
generate a marketable surplus in a more diversified and sustainable dryland farming&#13;
environment. While acknowledging that the agro-climatic environment is less favorable&#13;
than in many other areas of Indonesia, there still is a potential for agricultural growth in&#13;
Nusa Tenggara, provided that major constraints, such as poor access to public services,&#13;
limited diffusion of improved technology, inadequate infrastructure at the village and&#13;
kecamatan level, and at times restrictive government regulations, are addressed.&#13;
Improvement on these fronts will provide incentives for private on-farm investment, as&#13;
well as private investment in complementary economic activities, e.g. agro-processing and&#13;
exports.&#13;

2. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
Bank Experience and Lessons Learned&#13;
2.1   The Bank has financed a series of relevant agricultural projects including the&#13;
Upland Agriculture and Conservation Project (Loan 2474-IND, 1985), the Yogyakarta&#13;
Upland Area Development Project (Loan 3305-IND, 1991), the Provincial Irrigated&#13;
Agricultural Development Project (Loan 3302-IND, 1991) and the Nusa Tenggara&#13;
Agricultural Support Project (NTASP, Loan 2638-IND, 1986). The latter project&#13;
covered the same two provinces as the proposed project and was successfully completed&#13;
in 1994. All four projects demonstrated the importance of (a) decentralized and flexible&#13;
planning and control; (b) timely input delivery; (c) opportunistic water resources&#13;
development for crops and livestock; (d) complementary inputs and adoption packages;&#13;
(e) research in dryland farming systems; and (f) revolving credit/repayment-in-kind&#13;
approaches to adoption of improved farm practices. Other donors assisting Nusa&#13;
Tenggara development projects include CARE, CIDA, USAID, AusAID, ADB, World&#13;
Neighbors, IFAD and UNDP. Ownership commitment from the local governments and&#13;
broad participation by the beneficiaries are the key requirements for the success of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2.2   The ICR for NTASP rated the overall outcome and achievements of the project as&#13;
satisfactory, particularly when judged from the perspective of the operation being the first-&#13;
phase of a long-term program for the development of an area where a poor natural&#13;
resource base, harsh agro-ecological conditions, and deficient institutions and&#13;
infrastructure act as major constraints to agricultural development. Instituting a process&#13;
of addressing these constraints in a systematic way was perhaps the most important overall&#13;
outcome of the project.' The project directly benefited some 100,000 rural households,&#13;
most of them in the lowest income group, and increased their incomes by 25-50 percent&#13;
depending on the nature of support received.&#13;
2.3   Specific lessons from NTASP are:&#13;
(a)   broad-based development needs of areas characterized by serious physical,&#13;
institutional and infrastructural constraints will require a wide range of&#13;
interventions to initiate development of such areas;&#13;
(b)   program planning and implementation should be decentralized to the level&#13;
closest to the potential beneficiaries, but with clear administrative, technical&#13;
and operational linkages between the different tiers of government;&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
(c)    a participation strategy should be formulated early in the project cycle to&#13;
ensure community and beneficiary participation in planning and&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(d)   block financial allocations for local level development are attractive due to&#13;
their flexibility and demand responsiveness, but they should be backed by&#13;
appropriate guidelines and mechanisms for establishing clear objectives,&#13;
priorities, and rationale for any proposed development initiative;&#13;
(e)   investments in technology generation, as well as for addressing key&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks should be programmed early in the project&#13;
implementation period;&#13;
(f)    development of agro-ecologically and socio-economically complex areas&#13;
should be approached as a long-term program requiring a succession of&#13;
interventions, building on the experiences and lessons of each preceding&#13;
operation; and&#13;
(g)   comprehensive and appropriately focused mid-term reviews should be used&#13;
for major mid-course corrections while routine M&amp;E should continuously&#13;
focus on reviewing the rationale, technical and management soundness, and&#13;
likely development impact of all project activities.&#13;
The NTASP targeted particular kabupaten and contained a number of experimental&#13;
components, the more successful of which would be extended in the proposed project.&#13;
2.4    Worldwide, the Bank has assisted a large number of area development projects, 45&#13;
percent of them in Africa and 13 percent in the East Asia and Pacific Region. These&#13;
projects, however, fell in disfavor in the mid-1980s following the evaluated poor&#13;
performance of many earlier projects. In several countries, a series of projects had been&#13;
launched in quick succession, leaving little time for learning and applying lessons from&#13;
experience. Based on OED reviews and other sources', lessons include the following&#13;
prerequisites for success of area development projects:&#13;
(a)   clear government commitment to rural development objectives;&#13;
(b)   beneficiary participation as an essential feature of the identification,&#13;
planning and implementation process;&#13;
(c)   incentives in the form of potential benefits rural people may derive from a&#13;
public investment (e.g. a new road, a canal, etc.) which in turn may cause&#13;
7 Area Development Projects, Lessons and Practices, Operations Evaluation Department, September 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the return on smallholder investments to be high enough to justify the risks&#13;
involved;&#13;
(d)   a realistic and flexible project design with goals that are specific and&#13;
monitorable, not too complex, and scheduled over a realistic&#13;
implementation period;&#13;
(e)   institutional capability of government agencies and others involved (e.g.&#13;
LCOs) to implement the program efficiently; and&#13;
(f)   proven technology and support services to provide the necessary&#13;
production growth.&#13;
Government Strategy&#13;
2.5   For reasons of social equity and regional balance, the Government of Indonesia&#13;
(GOI) has highlighted development in the eastern islands in the Second Long Term&#13;
Development Plan and in REPELITA VI. The Government strategy for the east&#13;
emphasizes human resource development through education and training, improving&#13;
accessibility through development of transportation and communication systems, and&#13;
integrated area development. Poverty alleviation through low-income group targeting and&#13;
improved distribution of income are stressed in the Second Long Term Development Plan&#13;
which features a 7.8 percent growth rate for NTB and 6.1 percent for NTT. The sectoral&#13;
emphasis contains five categories:&#13;
(a)   infrastructure, particularly transportation to regional growth centers such&#13;
as Mataram (NTB) and Kupang (NTT);&#13;
(b)   productivity gains in agriculture, food security, cultivation of export crops,&#13;
farming systems research, post harvest technology, private sector&#13;
investment and land titling;&#13;
(c)   mining through private sector investment;&#13;
(d)   agribusiness and small scale village processing of agricultural commodities,&#13;
facilitated by tax and credit incentives and relaxed regulations; and&#13;
(e)   eco-tourism along coastal areas financed by both the private and public&#13;
sectors.&#13;
2.6   The Government is promoting regional development through increased block&#13;
grants to local governments and specific local government grants for health facilities,&#13;
village schools and the new village-based poverty program (IDT - Inpres Desa&#13;
Tertinggal). The IDT Program, launched in April 1994, was targeted at over 20,000 poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
villages, providing each with US$10,000 equivalent of seed capital. The proposed project&#13;
will cover some IDT villages, but the modalities of program planning, implementation and&#13;
financing will be different. The proposed project is agriculture based while IDT funds can&#13;
be spent on any productive purpose agreed upon by the villagers. Community workers&#13;
will assist the villages in identifying sub-projects in both IDT and the proposed project, but&#13;
local government line agencies will be used more extensively under the proposed project.&#13;
2.7   The national budget has been the largest source of public investments in Nusa&#13;
Tenggara: about 68 percent of total development expenditures in NTB and 52 percent in&#13;
NTT in 1990/91. Infrastructure and transportation are usually the largest recipients of&#13;
national funds, about 53 percent and 48 percent of APBN funds for NTB and NTT,&#13;
respectively. In FY 1993/94, the APBN allocations for agriculture were 7.6 percent for&#13;
NTB and 8.6 percent for NTT. In the provincial and kabupaten development budgets&#13;
(APBD I and APBD II, respectively), transportation and tourism also have been the main&#13;
recipients. Total annual development expenditures from all sources of NTB in 1990/91&#13;
was estimated at about Rp 219 billion and for NTT Rp 277 billion. Annual investment in&#13;
agriculture from all budget sources is estimated at Rp 62 billion for NTB and Rp 64 billion&#13;
for NTT. Annual disbursement flow under the proposed project is estimated at about&#13;
US$6.8 million, equivalent to about 3 percent of the total development budget of the two&#13;
provinces and 12 percent of annual public investment in agriculture.&#13;
Bank Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.8   Given the dominant role of agriculture and the prevalence of poverty in the rural&#13;
areas of Nusa Tenggara, broad-based and participatory agricultural income generation,&#13;
within cost-effective and technological limits, should be the over-riding objective. The&#13;
Bank's agricultural development strategy for Nusa Tenggara is based on lessons learned&#13;
worldwide and in Indonesia:&#13;
(a)   farmers and fishers are the majority of the poor, hence targeting geographic&#13;
areas and production systems is more effective and broad-based than&#13;
targeting poor households in these provinces (except possibly for livestock&#13;
distribution);&#13;
(b)   income generation and economic growth should be the primary means of&#13;
poverty alleviation in Nusa Tenggara rather than targeted welfare&#13;
measures;&#13;
(c)   protecting the means of production in rural areas, such as erosion control,&#13;
preservation of livestock assets, and improved fisheries management is a&#13;
priority;&#13;
(d)   farmers consider water resources and livestock development as their&#13;
highest priorities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
(e)   new technologies should have low capital investment and low operational&#13;
costs and result in higher labor productivity and thereby reduce the&#13;
farmers' risk when adopting new crop varieties or production systems; and&#13;
(f)   implementation should be decentralized with more local control of design&#13;
and expenditure.&#13;
2.9   The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Indonesia8 supports the Government&#13;
in the following key areas: (a) maintaining growth with macro-economic stability; (b)&#13;
enhancing competitiveness; (c) reducing poverty; (d) enhancing human resource&#13;
development; and (e) managing resources sustainably. The proposed project reflects the&#13;
more decentralized region-specific approach that is now emerging and is consistent with&#13;
the Bank's assistance strategy basic approaches for poverty alleviation and&#13;
decentralization of development activities. The project has a poverty-reduction emphasis&#13;
and promotes sustainable food security while seeking out cash earning opportunities. In&#13;
recognition of the limits to growth in agriculture, especially given the poor factor&#13;
endowments of the two provinces and the need to protect the fragile ecosystems, efforts&#13;
will be made to strike an appropriate balance between improving subsistence consumption&#13;
and exploiting market opportunities. This strategy is consistent with the GOI approach to&#13;
agricultural development. The Bank's broad experience in the agriculture sector in&#13;
Indonesia, in particular its involvement with the recently completed NTASP, its sector&#13;
work (Eastern Island Rural Sector Strategy Study of 1994), and its complementary&#13;
lending program discussed below justify continued involvement in the Nusa Tenggara&#13;
agricultural development effort.&#13;
2.10  The proposed project complements ongoing Bank-financed infrastructure and&#13;
human resources development projects in the region. In particular, the Eastern Indonesia&#13;
Kabupaten Roads Project (Loan 3579-IND, 1993, US$155 million); the Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project (Loan 3629-IND, 1993, US$80 million,&#13;
NTT and other areas); the Third Health Project (Loan 3042-IND, 1989, US$43.5 million,&#13;
NTB and other areas); and the Third Nutrition and Community Health Project (Loan&#13;
3550-IND, 1993, US$93.5 million, NTT) address basic human needs and improve&#13;
linkages between farms and markets. The Government's strong focus on infrastructure in&#13;
the region will also assist the strategy.&#13;
2.11   The Second Agricultural Research Management Project (ARM II, Loan 3886-&#13;
IND, 1995, US$63.0 million) will strengthen farming systems research throughout the&#13;
country through decentralized budgeting, local control and identifying and promoting&#13;
technologies appropriate to the local ecosystems. The ARM II Project and the proposed&#13;
project will both institutionalize the farming systems research begun under NTASP in&#13;
Kupang (Timor), Maumere (Flores) and Sandubaya (Lombok).&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
3.1   The proposed project is the second major intervention by a Bank-financed project&#13;
to support long-term agricultural development in two of Indonesia's poorest provinces. It&#13;
would build on experience gained under NTASP since 1986/87 and other programs which&#13;
have been irnplemented in the region. The project objectives are to raise smallholder&#13;
incomes, strengthen local level institutions andfoster broad- based participation at the&#13;
grassroots level. The project is part of Govermment's strategy to promote equitable&#13;
regional development&#13;
Project Areas&#13;
3.2   Target areas within the two Nusa Tenggara provinces have been identified by the&#13;
local government authorities in accordance with the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   high percentage of households below or near the poverty level;&#13;
(b)   significant potential for agricultural development;&#13;
(c)   potential for positive impact on environment through conservation farming;&#13;
(d)   existence of basic surface transportation infrastructure connecting target&#13;
areas with regional centers;&#13;
(e)    minimum level of government support services to support project&#13;
implementation; and&#13;
(f)   areas requiring special attention under the provincial and district&#13;
REPELITA VI plans and which have not received any funding from other&#13;
projects and programs.&#13;
3.3   In NTB, the project would target seven areas covering 23 kecamatan in six&#13;
kabupaten9 with a total land area of about 9,700 sq.km, or 48 percent of the total area of&#13;
the province. There are about 200 target villages of which 22 percent have been classified&#13;
as poor villages. Total population in the target area is estimated at 1.2 million (280,000&#13;
households), or 3 5 percent of the total population of the province. In NTT, there are ten&#13;
areas comprising 19 kecamatan in eight kabupaten'° with a total land area of 11,595&#13;
9 Lonbok Barat, Lombok Tengah, Lombok Timur, Sumbawa, Dompu and Bima.&#13;
10 Belu, Kupang, Timor Tengah Utara, Sumba Timur, Sumba Barat, Manggarai, Ende and Flores Tinur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
sq.km, or 24 percent of the total area of the province and a population of 0.7 million&#13;
(125,000 households), or 21 percent of the total population. The areas contain about 310&#13;
villages of which 24 percent have been classified as poor villages. The target areas in&#13;
NTB are outside the central rice production areas in Lombok and Sumbawa which already&#13;
have benefited from considerable previous investments in irrigation and transportation&#13;
infrastructure. In NTT, ten areas outside the selected project target areas also have been&#13;
designated as priority areas for agricultural development during the next three years and&#13;
would be financed from the provincial budget.&#13;
Project Scope&#13;
3.4   The project would be implemented over a six-year period (1996-2002) and provide&#13;
funds to support the establishment of the Naibonat Assessment Institute for Agricultural&#13;
Technology (NAIAT), implementation of agriculture-based area development activities,&#13;
and strengthening of agricultural support services, project administration, and community-&#13;
based development planning.&#13;
Detailed Project Features&#13;
Component A: Establishment of the Naibonat Assessment Institute for Agricultural&#13;
Technology (NAIAT); Base Cost US$4.3 million (14 percent of total base cost).&#13;
3.5   The NTASP established the physical infrastructure, institutions and programs for&#13;
improving the technological base for agricultural development in the two provinces. It has&#13;
introduced a whole farm (farming systems) approach for improving smalUholder&#13;
production and income, and also identified and tested technological packages for some of&#13;
the arid and semi-arid areas of the two provinces. The proposed project would further&#13;
refine the technical parameters of these packages and evaluate more rigorously their&#13;
viability and acceptability among the farmers. Main lessons of NTASP were the need to:&#13;
(a) fully identify the constraints affecting the production of low-income farmers; and (b)&#13;
start with low input-low cost technology and build the confidence of the farmers step-by-&#13;
step (see Annex 1 for further details).&#13;
3.6   Building on the experience and lessons of NTASP, the proposed project would&#13;
support the Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD) in order to:&#13;
(a)   carry out research activities to develop technology packages appropriate to&#13;
the agro-ecological systems of Nusa Tenggara;&#13;
(b)   strengthen the linkages between agricultural research, agricultural&#13;
extension, local government authorities, local community organizations&#13;
(LCOs) and the private sector; and&#13;
(c)   transfer technology packages to area farmers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Details are given in the following paragraphs and in Annex 1.&#13;
3.7    Establishment and Operation of the NAIAT. The project would:&#13;
(a)    establish for each province a Regional Advisory Comrnittee for policy and&#13;
management advice and a Regional Technical Working Group for&#13;
technical support;&#13;
(b)   develop a regional Research and Development (R&amp;D) master plan, a&#13;
human resource development program, and an MIS program;&#13;
(c)   in NTT, construct a new liaison office at Kupang, a seed cold storage unit,&#13;
a drying floor and a soil preparation facility at Naibonat, and an irrigation&#13;
system for about 50 ha at the Livestock Research Station at Lili;&#13;
(d)   in NTB, convert part of the Mataram Installation of NAIAT to a liaison&#13;
office, and construct a general service laboratory building and three staff&#13;
houses at Mataram on Lombok;&#13;
(e)    provide furniture and equipment for the new installations, and computer&#13;
systems for Naibonat (Timor) main station and Maumere (Flores),&#13;
Sandubaya and Mataram (Lombok) installations;&#13;
(f)    provide nine vehicles and nine motorcycles for the main station and&#13;
installations and a boat for Maumere sub-basis;&#13;
(g)   provide journals, periodicals and textbooks to the libraries of the main&#13;
station and installations; and&#13;
(h)   provide funds for honoraria and allowances of research staff and operation&#13;
and maintenance of facilities.&#13;
3.8    Definition of Agro-Ecological Zones. The project would prepare additional&#13;
detailed studies of the agro-ecological zones (AEZ), based on existing data from&#13;
reconnaissance soil surveys and climatic information, combined with information on the&#13;
social, cultural and ethnic characteristics of the zones. Farning systems research and&#13;
diagnosis of the socio-economic context of the agro-ecosystems zones would include&#13;
rapid rural appraisal and participatory rural appraisal methods and gender analysis,&#13;
including environmental assessment and conservation technologies to identify input&#13;
constraints, allocation of resources and division of tasks and responsibilities within farm&#13;
households. It also would include a cattle marketing study to examine the impact of trade&#13;
restrictions on farmers' incomes (see also para. 6.9). The studies would be implemented&#13;
by research staff working with local provincial government staff, LCO members, and staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
of local universities. The findings would form the basis for location-specific definition of&#13;
potential and constraints facing the farmers and would assist in the formulation of low&#13;
input technology packages.&#13;
3.9   Staff Resources Development, Technical Assistance and R&amp;D Collaboration.&#13;
The project would provide:&#13;
(a)   local training within Indonesia for masters, doctorate and short-term non-&#13;
degree or diploma training to strengthen staff capability in specific skills to&#13;
effectively implement the R&amp;D;&#13;
(b)   about 18 staff-months of expatriate and 66 staff-months of local technical&#13;
support for farming systems research, gender analysis studies and other&#13;
needs; and&#13;
(c)   R&amp;D collaboration with international research centers, twinning&#13;
arrangement between NAIAT and one of these centers, and collaboration&#13;
with the private sector, local universities, and community organizations to&#13;
undertake topic surveys and field research.&#13;
3.10  Technology Generation and Dissemination. The project would support:&#13;
(a)   trials of improved and new technology, including production and post-&#13;
production systems involving women, under farmer and field station&#13;
conditions;&#13;
(b)   inputs and technical guidance for about 680 ha (280 ha in NTB and 400 ha&#13;
in NTT) of dryland field demonstrations;&#13;
(c)   dissemination of technology recommendations through organization of field&#13;
days, production of leaflets, posters, slides and videos, organization of&#13;
workshops and publication of research findings; and&#13;
(d)   travel, per diem and allowances for research and extension staff involved.&#13;
Component B: Agriculture-Based Area Development; Base Cost US$22.7 million&#13;
(73 percent of total base cost).&#13;
3.11  The project would support a program of agriculture-based area development&#13;
activities in the target areas. The approach would be participatory, based on an&#13;
assessment of the resources of each area and consultations with the people through a&#13;
community based planning system. A menu of potential agricultural development&#13;
activities for this component has been identified, including improved cropping in village&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
irrigation schemes, dryland farming systems development, cattle distribution, household&#13;
technology packages, and vaccination of chickens against Newcastle disease. In addition,&#13;
the project also would support the improvement of critical road sections, bridges and&#13;
culverts to improve communications between farms and markets. Finally, the project&#13;
would support as yet unidentified other development activities proposed by the local&#13;
communities. A summary of these activities, most of which have been well tested under&#13;
NTASP, is given below. Further details on some of the constraints encountered during&#13;
NTASP and proposed implementation arrangements for the proposed project, are&#13;
discussed in Annex 2.&#13;
3.12 Agricultural Development. This would include the following:&#13;
(a)   intensification of agricultural production systems in village irrigation&#13;
schemes where water control structures have been rehabilitated or&#13;
improved under NTASP, GOI's Village Irrigation Program (PID,&#13;
sometimes referred to as "crash program"), and the Asian Development&#13;
Bank financed Farmer-Managed Irrigation System Project (FMISP) in&#13;
NTB. The project would support the establishment of about 10&#13;
demonstration plots of about 0.5 ha each in some 265 schemes (165 in&#13;
NTB and 100 in NTT) to demonstrate the effects of improved crop&#13;
production technology;&#13;
(b)   a pilot program introducing improved dryland farming systems technology&#13;
and soil conservation techniques, including the provision of seedlings,&#13;
seeds, fertilizers, tools and equipment to about 16,800 farmers (9,200 in&#13;
NTB and 7,600 in NTT) covering some 12,600 ha;&#13;
(c)   introduction and demonstration of intensive smallholder livestock&#13;
management systems, integrated with dryland crop development, including&#13;
distribution of about 16,000 breeding cattle and 1,000 water buffaloes for&#13;
draft, and the development of forage crops;&#13;
(d)   vaccination of chickens in about 325 villages against Newcastle disease;&#13;
(e)   demonstrations of intensified house plot cultivation systems, including&#13;
provision of inputs, tools and equipment to about 2,800 households (1,200&#13;
in NTB and 1,600 in NTT); and&#13;
(f)   technical training for Dinas staff, extension workers, farmers and viliage&#13;
leaders on integrated animalcrop farming systems, post harvest&#13;
technology, village irrigation O&amp;M, livestock feed and health, water supply&#13;
and sanitation, home gardens intensification, poultry vaccination, etc. and&#13;
also on the effective and gender-sensitive use of demonstrations of locally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
adapted production technologies, in particular for integrated farming&#13;
systems, e.g. tree crops and livestock.&#13;
3.13  Lessons learned during NTASP (see para. 2.3) would be reflected in the&#13;
implementation arrangements for the present project. Special care would be taken to limit&#13;
the use of cash inputs for the crop/livestock farming systems for as long as the farmers'&#13;
capacity to pay or obtain credit is low. The farmers would be encouraged to organize&#13;
themselves in groups and to pool part of their savings for the joint procurement of inputs&#13;
(see also para. 4.6). More attention would also be given to the production of good quality&#13;
seedlings in Dinas Estates Tk. II operated nurseries and to the proper sequencing of&#13;
interventions to raise the survival prospects for tree crops and cattle. The bottom-up&#13;
planning process will be applied for all of Component B. Participation of women in&#13;
appropriate project activities would be encouraged. Training of Dinas staff and&#13;
participation of LCOs in the planning and implementation of activities will improve their&#13;
prospects for success.&#13;
3.14  Farm Access Roads. In order to reduce transportation bottlenecks the project&#13;
would support the construction of critical bridges, culverts, and road sections on farm-to-&#13;
market roads. Local government funding and community participation would be&#13;
mobilized to improve the surfacing for these access roads. Ideally, allocations for each&#13;
kabupaten and village should reflect their infrastructure needs. However, for simplicity&#13;
and transparency a maximum grant of US$250,000 equivalent per kecamatan is foreseen.&#13;
As there already exists a relatively dense road network in Lombok (NTB), no allocation&#13;
for farm access roads has been made for this island. Assurances have been obtained from&#13;
GOI during negotiations that: (a) allocations for road improvement would not exceed&#13;
US$250,000 equivalent for each kecamatan included in the project (except those on&#13;
Lombok); and (b) priority would be given to villages where needs are demonstrated to be&#13;
highest, the villagers are committed to actively contribute to the implementation of the&#13;
works, and local government has agreed to maintain the completed works.&#13;
3.15 Local Community Initiatives. The project would support local community&#13;
initiatives expected to result in direct benefits to the communities. During the first project&#13;
year local leaders and agency field staff would be trained in community based planning&#13;
methods. As part of the training program guidelines for selection and implementation of&#13;
schemes in Bahasa Indonesia would be prepared. Technically and economically feasible&#13;
initiatives considered to be a high priority by the local communities would be implemented&#13;
using discretionary supplemental project funding of Rp 50 million (about US$22,250)&#13;
annually for five years for each kecamatan. In addition, Rp 35 million (about US$15,500)&#13;
would be allocated annually for five years for each of the 14 targeted kabupaten to&#13;
support LCOs in developing community-based development initiatives.&#13;
3.16  Project supported local community initiatives are expected to include agriculture&#13;
based activities, such as post-harvest processing and storage facilities, domestic water&#13;
supply systems linked to the village irrigation schemes, goat or other small animal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
distribution schemes, and replications for the core menu of activities proposed by&#13;
community groups in the target areas. Preference would be given to schemes that would&#13;
involve women and youth groups and those assisted by LCOs. Initiatives would only be&#13;
funded when the community is prepared to contribute locally available materials, unskilled&#13;
labor and land, if required. All proposals would be reviewed at the kabupaten level to&#13;
prioritize those with the greatest socio-economic impact, the lowest risk and the highest&#13;
proposed contribution by the local community. Initiatives would be selected in&#13;
accordance with criteria fully detailed in Annex 2, paras. 58 and 59. Assurances to this&#13;
effect have been obtained from GOI during negotiations.&#13;
Component C: Strengthening Agricultural Support Services and Project&#13;
Administration; Base Cost US$4.1 million (13 percent of total base cost).&#13;
3.17  Support services to crop cultivation, livestock keeping, project planning, financial&#13;
management, project coordination, and M&amp;E at the provincial, kabupaten and kecamatan&#13;
level would be strengthened under the project.&#13;
3.18  Strengthening of Extension Facilities. The project would:&#13;
(a)   rehabilitate 18 rural extension centers (RECs) and 11 animal health centers&#13;
(Poskeswan), construct two new RECs and 11 new Poskeswan, and&#13;
improve 14 seed farms;&#13;
(b)   provide 46 vehicles and 256 motorcycles for field services of the Dinas;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)   provide 86 computers, furniture and equipment for the newly constructed,&#13;
rehabilitated and improved RECs, Poskeswan and seed farms.&#13;
Given the inadequate maintenance and utilization of facilities at present, project support&#13;
for rehabilitation, construction and improvement of RECs, Poskeswan and seed farms&#13;
would be dependent on the kabupaten level governments providing an integrated&#13;
management plan for each facility. Such a management plan would include: (a) staffing&#13;
levels; (b) estimates and sources of annual funding requirements to support successful&#13;
operation; (c) expected benefits to area farmers; and (d) planned types and levels of user&#13;
fees or other cost recovery systems, if applicable. An assurance to this effect has been&#13;
obtained from GOI during negotiations.&#13;
3.19 Training, Workshops and Seminars. The project would support: (a) project&#13;
orientation workshops and training of provincial, kabupaten and field level staff on&#13;
project management, M&amp;E, financial management, and community-based development&#13;
planning and implementation; and (b) training of farmers and village leaders on&#13;
community-based development activities. The selection procedure should consider gender&#13;
perspectives to ensure participation of women in these programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
3.20 Mapping. The project would support the production of base maps of the targeted&#13;
kecamatan to serve as a basis for improved planning, implementation, coordination, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of development activities.&#13;
3.21  Technical Assistance. The project would provide for:&#13;
(a)   about 212 staff-months of local consultancy support for various activities,&#13;
including: area development (42 staff-months), training (30 staff-months),&#13;
financial management/accountancy (108 staff-months), evaluation of&#13;
NTASP irrigation schemes (12 staff-months), and unspecified short-term&#13;
technical studies (20 staff-months); and&#13;
(b)   establishment of an M&amp;E system, including an initial inventory of income&#13;
and production information, periodic reporting on financial and physical&#13;
progress, a mid-term review, and an evaluation of development impact at&#13;
project completion.&#13;
The reports' findings and recommendations should be issued in Bahasa Indonesia with a&#13;
summary in English. The consultants would be appointed by July 1, 1996.&#13;
3.22  Recurrent Costs. Incremental recurrent costs including honoraria, staff&#13;
alowances, operations and maintenance costs, project coordination and management, at&#13;
the provincial, kabupaten and kecamatan have been included in the cost of the project and&#13;
would be financed by the Bank on a declining scale.&#13;
Status of Preparation and Implementation Schedule&#13;
3.23  The project has been prepared by the Directorate General for Regional and Area&#13;
Development in the Department of Home Affairs with the assistance of consultants. The&#13;
preparation team interacted fully with the intended beneficiaries in all selected kabupaten.&#13;
A draft preparation report and Project Implementation Plan were issued in April 1995 and&#13;
formed the basis for the appraisal by the Bank. GOI submitted a revised Project&#13;
Implementation Plan in August 1995. The project implementation schedule is at Annex 7.&#13;

4. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
4.1     Total project cost including contingencies is estimated at US$41.1 million of which&#13;
US$5.5 million would be foreign exchange and US$1.5 million duties and taxes. Base&#13;
costs are expressed in October 1995 values. Physical contingencies are estimated at 10&#13;
percent for civil works, equipment and vehicles and 5 percent for agricultural inputs,&#13;
breeding animals, mapping and research. Price contingencies are based on an estimated&#13;
annual local inflation rate of 6 percent and a foreign inflation rate of 2.6 percent from&#13;
FY96. Project costs are summarized in Table 4.1 below and detailed in Annex 4.&#13;

4.2     The proposed Bank loan of US$27.0 million equivalent would finance about 66&#13;
percent of total project costs, or 72 percent of project cost exclusive of taxes, duties,&#13;
vehicles and fertilizers which would be purchased by GOI. The Government would&#13;
finance US$12.4 million equivalent (30 percent of project cost) and the balance of US$1.7&#13;
million equivalent (4 percent of project cost) would be financed by the beneficiaries&#13;
contributing their labor for tree crop planting and other community-based activities.&#13;

Financing of Proposed Development Activities&#13;
4.3    The project would help the farmers with the introduction of input packages for&#13;
food crops, tree crops and cattle keeping. Annual inputs for irrigated cropping&#13;
demonstrations, including farm tools, improved seeds and fertilizers, would be supplied for&#13;
one cropping cycle as grants to the participating farmers. This subsidy is justified as the&#13;
early adopters provide a demonstration effect for follower adopters. " The&#13;
demonstrations would cover about eight percent of the targeted area of selected village&#13;
irrigation schemes. The value of the input package would be about US$60 equivalent for&#13;
a 0.5 ha farm plot.&#13;
4.4   For dryland cropping the project would supply free-of-charge tree crop seedlings,&#13;
food crop seeds, farm tools, fertilizers and other required inputs to farmers participating in&#13;
the demonstration and replication programs. Demonstration program participants would&#13;
also be paid partially for their labor. Tree crops would be supported for two years under&#13;
both programs and annual crops for one year. The value of the support packages would&#13;
be about US$140 equivalent for dryland demonstrations on a plot of 0.75 ha, and US$90&#13;
equivalent for dryland replications. Given the higher risk of adopting new technology, and&#13;
the pilot nature of the dryland program, the subsidization of the present group of&#13;
beneficiaries is considered justified. For house plot cropping, arrangements would be&#13;
similar as for dryland cropping. The value of the support package would be about US$40&#13;
equivalent for a plot of 0.2 ha. The rationale for the subsidy is the sarne as for the&#13;
irrigated cropping technology packages.&#13;
1 In economic language: the early adopters confer an externality for follower adopters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
4.5   For cattle and buffalo raising the project would supply breeding stock to&#13;
successful participants of the irrigated and dryland crop improvement programs.&#13;
Participating farmers would promise to return within five years the second- and third-born&#13;
calves for redistribution among other interested farmers or for sale (usually the male&#13;
calves) to cover part of the operating cost of the livestock support services. An&#13;
assurance to this effect has been obtained from the Government during negotiations. The&#13;
estimated value of a heifer is about US$225.&#13;
4.6   Access to commercial credit for the purchase of farm inputs would not be open to&#13;
project farmers, especially not those located in the rainfed areas, in view of the early stage&#13;
of development of their small farms and the inherent risks of failure. Many farmers appear&#13;
to have access to informal credit from relatives, friends and traders, but often at&#13;
prohibitive costs. Promising experiments are currently underway under the Yogyakarta&#13;
Upland Area Development Project (Loan 3305-IND) and the Integrated Swamps&#13;
Development Project (Loan 3755-IND) with farmer-managed revolving fund schemes for&#13;
the joint purchase of inputs. Similar schemes would be tried out under the proposed&#13;
project. Community development facilitators would encourage the farmers to organize&#13;
themselves in informal groups before the project-financed input packages would be issued&#13;
to them. After the harvest they would deposit part of their cash income, in amounts at&#13;
least equal to the value of the inputs they received, into the group's revolving fund.&#13;
Authorized representatives of the gi oup would draw on the fund to pay for group&#13;
purchases of inputs for the following crop season. Each group would set its own rules of&#13;
operation. Over time, other farmers may either become members of already existing&#13;
groups, or, if the rules of the group do not permit adhesion of new members, form new&#13;
groups. As experience with grassroots credit schemes under this and other projects&#13;
evolves, the training of facilitators would be updated and new formats would be&#13;
introduced.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
4.7   General. Goods and works would be procured in accordance with the provisions&#13;
of the "Guidelines for the Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", published by&#13;
the Bank in January 1995. Procurement under the project would be undertaken by the&#13;
respective implementing units under the guidance and control of provincial and/or national&#13;
parent agencies. Bulking and grouping of contracts across agencies or provinces would&#13;
not be practical and has therefore not been adopted. GOI would finance purchases of&#13;
vehicles and fertilizer (urea, TSP and KCL) from its own resources because under GOI&#13;
procurement rules these items are not open for international competitive bidding.&#13;
Procurement of vehicles would be in accordance with a schedule and timetable agreed&#13;
with the Bank. An assurance to this effect has been obtained from GOI during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
4.8   Civil Works. Contracts for the construction and rehabilitation of agricultural&#13;
extension centers, seed farms and animal health posts (US$0.9 million), and agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
research facilities (US$0.4 million) are expected to be relatively small and would be widely&#13;
dispersed over the two provinces. They would therefore be procured by national&#13;
competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Roads, bridges and&#13;
culverts (US$8.0 million) would be constructed on force account with participation by the&#13;
villagers or by a procedure similar to national shopping for works costing less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent (para. 3.14). Under this procedure small works would be procured&#13;
under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from&#13;
three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation&#13;
would include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the&#13;
required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant&#13;
drawings, where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who offers the&#13;
lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to&#13;
complete the contract successfully.&#13;
4.9   Equipment and Agricultural Inputs. Equipment, furniture and publications for&#13;
the new research, extension, seed production and animal health buildings and agricultural&#13;
equipment and tools (US$1.7 million) would be procured by NCB procedures acceptable&#13;
to the Bank, or by national shopping for packages costing less than US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
with an aggregate value not to exceed US$1.0 million. Agricultural inputs (US$1.8&#13;
rnillion) would be purchased by national shopping. Breeding animals (US$5.5 million)&#13;
would be procured by NCB procedures and using a model bid document acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
4.10  Other Procurement. Consultant services (US$1.8 million) would be contracted&#13;
after inviting proposals from shortlisted firms acceptable to the Bank. Separate contracts&#13;
would be let by AARD and BANGDA, respectively, for consultants services for: (a)&#13;
establishment and operation of Naibonat AIAT; and (b) strengthening of agricultural&#13;
support services and project administration. All consultants would be selected in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines, and engaged according to the Bank's Standard&#13;
Form of Contract for Consultants' Services. Training, research, mapping, and survey and&#13;
design (US$2.8 million) would be procured in accordance with the above guidelines.&#13;
Procurement for activities listed under the "local community initiatives" sub-component&#13;
(US$7.4 million) would be in accordance with provisions of the above paragraphs.&#13;
4.11  Review of Procurement. The Bank would make a prior review of all documents&#13;
related to the award of: (a) all contracts of US$100,000 equivalent or more for civil&#13;
works, goods and breeding animals; (b) the first contract for civil works in NTB and in&#13;
NTT of less than US$100,000; (c) the first contract for goods in NTB and NTT of less&#13;
than US$100,000; and (d) all contracts of US$100,000 equivalent or more for&#13;
consultants' services by firms and all contracts of US$50,000 or more for consultants'&#13;
services by individuals. Due to the repetitive nature of small contracts, characteristic for&#13;
this type of project, prior review is expected to cover only about 50 percent by value of&#13;
all civil works construction, and supply of goods and breeding animals contracts. For&#13;
consultant contracts, the review would include terms of reference, shortlist, letter of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
invitation, recommendation for award, and final contract. The exceptions to prior Bank&#13;
review of contracts for consultants' services would not apply to: (a) the terms of reference&#13;
for such contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a&#13;
critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank; (d) amendments to contracts for the&#13;
employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or&#13;
more; or (e) amendments to contracts for the employment of individual consultants raising&#13;
the contract value to US$50,000 equivalent or more. The Bank would review all other&#13;
procurement ex-post and at random.&#13;
4.12 The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
4.13  All activities under the project are expected to be completed by March 31, 2002,&#13;
and the Loan closing date would be September 30, 2002. Disbursements from the Loan&#13;
would be made for:&#13;
(a)   65 percent of expenditures on civil works;&#13;
(b)   100 percent of foreign expenditures (CIF) for directly imported equipment&#13;
and furniture, 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally&#13;
manufactured items, and 65 percent of expenditures on locally procured&#13;
items;&#13;
(c)   100 percent of expenditures for consultants' services and training;&#13;
(d)   90 percent of expenditures on agricultural inputs (except fertilizers),&#13;
breeding animals, labor for agricultural demonstrations, mapping, surveys&#13;
and designs, and research trials;&#13;
(e)   70 percent of expenditures for services, works, and equipment procured&#13;
under the "local community initiatives" sub-component; and&#13;
(f)   60 percent of incremental operating expenditures in FYI 996/97 and&#13;
FY1997/98, 50 percent in FY1998/99 and FY1999/2000, and 40 percent in&#13;
FY2000/01 and thereafter.&#13;
The proposed allocation of the loan is detailed in Annex 5, Table 2.&#13;

Disbursements from the Loan for the following contracts would be made against full&#13;
documentation: (a) works and goods contracts (including publications, agricultural inputs&#13;
and breeding animals) and consultant services by firms valued at or more than&#13;
US$100,000; and (b) consultant services contracts with individual consultants valued at&#13;
more than US$50,000. All other disbursements would be made against statements of&#13;
expenditures (SOE) for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible&#13;
project implementing agencies and the Directorate General of Budget (Ministry of&#13;
Finance) and be made available for inspection by Bank supervision mission.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.15 In order to facilitate disbursements, the Government would establish a Special&#13;
Account with an authorized allocation of US$1.5 million (equivalent to the average&#13;
disbursements during a four-month period) in Bank Indonesia, provided that the&#13;
authorized allocation would be limited to US$800,000 until the aggregate amount of&#13;
withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special&#13;
commitments would be equal to or exceed US$3.0 million. The Special Account would&#13;
be maintained by the Directorate General of Budget, MOF. All disbursements from the&#13;
Bank loan would be made through the Special Account. Replenishment applications to&#13;
the Special Account will be made on a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the Special&#13;
Account balance has been used, whichever comes first.&#13;
4.16  Each project executing agency would establish and maintain adequate and separate&#13;
accounts from the beginning of project implementation, including accounts relating to the&#13;
cattle distribution program. To facilitate audit of project accounts, BANGDA (the project&#13;
lead agency) would collect and consolidate account records of all implementing agencies&#13;
into a single document. Assurances have been obtained from GOI during negotiations&#13;
that: (a) all project accounts, including schedules of expenditures claimed under SOE&#13;
procedures and usage of the Special Account, would be audited annually by the&#13;
Government Audit Agency (BPKP), or other suitably qualified auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank; and (b) audit reports of project accounts, SOE and Special Account would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank within nine months of the close of each Government fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. ORGANIZATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND&#13;
MONITORING&#13;
Organizational Structure&#13;
5.1   The proposed project would be implemented in a decentralized, multi-sectoral&#13;
approach with primary responsibility for project execution being placed at the kabupaten&#13;
and kecamatan levels. Organizational arrangements are shown in Chart 1. At the&#13;
national level, a Central Guidance Committee (CGC) would be established to provide&#13;
policy guidance and coordination, review project progress, and resolve issues on overall&#13;
loan administration. The CGC would be chaired by the Deputy V for Regional Affairs in&#13;
BAPPENAS and comprise, among others, the Director General Regional Development&#13;
(Ministry of Home Affairs), Director General of AARD, Heads of Bureaus for Agriculture&#13;
and Regional II (BAPPENAS), Director of Area Development (Ministry of Home&#13;
Affairs), and Director of Center for Agriculture Socio Economic Research (CASER) in&#13;
AARD. It would meet on a quarterly basis and invite representatives of other central&#13;
agencies and provincial authorities as appropriate. A National Project Secretariat would&#13;
be established in the Directorate of Area Development (PPW) of the MoHA with the&#13;
following mandate:&#13;
(a)   coordinate project planning and budgeting at the national and provincial&#13;
level;&#13;
(b)   review annual work plans and budgets and process the Decision Letter for&#13;
Budget Assistance (SPABP) for the provinces;&#13;
(c)   monitor and evaluate project implementation and impact;&#13;
(d)   prepare periodic project progress reports (annual/semi-annual);&#13;
(e)   implement national level activities such as project orientation workshops,&#13;
training for national staff on project management, recruitment of&#13;
consultants, etc.; and&#13;
(f)   liaise with the Bank, administer loan disbursements and consolidate project&#13;
accounts from the provinces.&#13;
5.2   At provincial level, a Provincial Coordination Committee (PCC) chaired by the&#13;
BAPPEDA I Chairman would be responsible for coordination, planning and M&amp;E of&#13;
project activities. The PCC would be supported by a Provincial Project Secretariat (PPS)&#13;
headed by the Chief of the BAPPEDA Economic Division, which would perform similar&#13;
functions as the National Project Secretariat:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
(a)   ensure province-wide coordination of all project activities;&#13;
(b)   review the kabupaten activities, annual work plans and budgets;&#13;
(c)   monitor and evaluate project implementation and prepare progress reports;&#13;
(d)   prepare loan disbursement applications for Components B and C;&#13;
(e)   carry out provincial level activities; and&#13;
(f)   liaise with central Government agencies, kabupaten, and the Bank.&#13;
Project Management Units would be established, and project managers (PIMPRO)&#13;
appointed, at the provincial level to manage: (a) planning, monitoring and evaluation;&#13;
(b) livestock distribution; and (c) training activities.&#13;
5.3   Consistent with arrangements adopted under the ARM HI project, the Naibonat&#13;
AIAT has established in each province a Regional Advisory Committee and a Regional&#13;
Technical Working Group to provide guidance for NAIAT during project implementation.&#13;
The Advisory Committee, chaired by the BAPPEDA Chairman and composed of the&#13;
KANWIL of the Ministry of Agriculture and representatives of the provincial Dinas,&#13;
universities, private sector and farmer groups, would review the annual R&amp;D plan for the&#13;
province. The Technical Working Group is chaired by the NAIAT Director with&#13;
representation from various regional and provincial agencies. A Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU) with a PIMPRO has been established at NAIAT, and a Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) with a Sub-project Manager (PIMBAGPRO) has been appointed at&#13;
Mataram/NTB. The PMU would be responsible for the implementation of all project&#13;
activities with oversight from the Director of CASER through the Director of NAIAT.&#13;
Officers would be designated at CASER and CARP (Center for Agricultural Research&#13;
Program) to liaise with the Project Secretariat and the Bank.&#13;
5.4   At kabupaten level, PMUs would be maintained at BAPPEDA II with a PIMPRO&#13;
to coordinate project planning/budgeting and implementation in the kabupaten. PIUs with&#13;
PIMPROs would be located at the respective Dinas Tk. II which would be responsible for&#13;
the implementation of the field activities. The PMUs would be responsible to the PPS&#13;
through the Bupati (head of kabupaten government). An assurance has been obtained&#13;
from Government at negotiations that a PMU with competent staff in adequate numbers&#13;
would be maintained in each participating kabupaten until completion of the project.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
5.5   NAIAT would prepare the annual research plans and on-farm demonstration&#13;
prograns for Component A following internal AARD procedures. The plan would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31 -&#13;
reviewed by the Technical Working Groups. When approved by the Advisory&#13;
Committees, the work plan and budgets for the two provinces would be submitted to&#13;
CARP through CASER for DIP funding. The research results would be presented to the&#13;
Working Groups at seminars, also attended by other interested persons. The results of the&#13;
seminars would be used as feedback for the preparation of the next year's annual plan.&#13;
5.6   Trials and demonstrations would be carried out mostly in the farmers' fields.&#13;
NAIAT staff would design and select the sites for all trials and demonstrations and would&#13;
ensure adequate coverage of all project areas. Field staff of the respective Dinas Tk. II&#13;
and LCO staff on site would ensure the day-to-day management of the trials and&#13;
demonstrations.&#13;
5.7   In order to foster broad beneficiary participation, the project would use community&#13;
development facilitators (CDF) for Component B to motivate and assist the target groups.&#13;
The kabupaten level PMUs would encourage locally active LCOs to select CDFs for their&#13;
areas of operation. In areas without active LCOs existing Dinas staff would be assigned&#13;
for this purpose. The CDFs would help the target groups to:&#13;
(a)   identify their main constraints and priority needs;&#13;
(b)   select the most appropriate project intervention from the menu of choices;&#13;
(c)   prepare the project proposal for financing;&#13;
(d)   provide their equity contribution to the project;&#13;
(e)   decide on how best to implement the sub-project;&#13;
(f)   implement the sub-project; and&#13;
(g)   ensure monitoring, evaluation and mid-course correction of project&#13;
implementation, if necessary.&#13;
5.8   The community-based development approach would be adopted as much as&#13;
feasible and appropriate, in accordance with the "bottom-up" planning procedures&#13;
established by GOI since 1982, as follows:&#13;
(a)   the CDFs trained in community-based planning would inform the target&#13;
groups of beneficiaries on the menu of project activities;&#13;
(b)   the community groups, with the help of the CDFs, would determine their&#13;
priorities and prepare proposals for submission to the UDKP/kecamatan;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
(c)   the UDKP/kecamatan would review the feasibility of the proposals, and&#13;
submit it to the PMU at kabupaten level for inclusion in the proposed&#13;
annual work plan and budget;&#13;
(d)   the groups' proposals would be evaluated based on soundness and other&#13;
criteria as agreed by PMU/kabupaten and the Dinas; preference would be&#13;
given to proposals involving women and youth groups and those assisted&#13;
by LCOs; the proposals would be ranked by priority if requests exceed the&#13;
funds available for the next fiscal year; and&#13;
(e)   upon approval, the group would implement the activities with the guidance&#13;
from the LCO and Dinas staff.&#13;
5.9   For Component C, training programs would be implemented by the National&#13;
Project Secretariat for the central level training, by the Provincial Project Secretariat at&#13;
BAPPEDA I for the training conducted at provincial level, and by PIUs at&#13;
PMU/BAPPEDA II for training to be conducted at kabupaten and field levels. The PlUs&#13;
will only manage the administration arrangements for the training, but the trainers would&#13;
come from the respective Technical Dinas Tk. I or II staff, existing training centers,&#13;
universities, research institutes/BPTP, and as appropriate, from the respective Unit, i.e.&#13;
Secretariat or PMU.&#13;
Budget Procedures&#13;
5.10 Project activities would be financed in accordance with existing GOI procedures&#13;
for financing Bank-assisted projects. Funds for project activities would be provided under&#13;
the budgets of the Ministries of Agriculture (Component A) and Home Affairs&#13;
(Components B and C) at the national level. Budget allocations for project activities&#13;
would be based on coordinated annual work programs agreed among project&#13;
implementation agencies and BAPPEDA at the provincial level. The budgeting process&#13;
under the proposed project would comprise the following steps:&#13;
(a)   the provincial BAPPEDAs would review the proposed work programs&#13;
proposed at local levels and referred to in para. 5.8 and prepare&#13;
coordinated provincial work plans and draft budgets;&#13;
(b)   the coordinated provincial work plans and draft budgets would be sent to&#13;
the National Project Secretariat for review and consolidation and thereafter&#13;
submitted to BAPPENAS, AARD and MoHA in August for incorporation&#13;
in their annual budget proposals;&#13;
(c)   the coordinated work plans and cost estimates would be forwarded to the&#13;
Bank by September 30 of each year for review; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
(d)   a coordinated budget proposal based on the agreed work plan would be&#13;
forwarded to the Bank before December 31 of each project year.&#13;
To ensure that adequate funds would be provided for planned project activities,&#13;
assurances have been obtained from GOI at negotiations that GOI would submit to the&#13;
Bank for its review and comments: (a) not later than September 30 each year, a&#13;
coordinated work program and cost estimates for the following fiscal year; and (b) by&#13;
December 31 each year, a coordinated budget proposal for the provincial work programs&#13;
agreed with the Bank.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
5.11   Given the scale of community-based activities and the decentralized structure and&#13;
system for managing the project, close monitoring of project activities is essential for&#13;
informing the higher management levels of any implementation problems and to permit&#13;
well-considered decisions on mid-course corrections. Evaluation of project impact is&#13;
equally important in order to learn lessons, positive and negative, for future projects.&#13;
5.12  The proposed M&amp;E system would use different sets of instruments for the three&#13;
project components. In addition to the regular reports on financial and physical progress,&#13;
the proposed M&amp;E system includes impact analysis for five project activities: village&#13;
irrigation, agricultural research, dryland farming, livestock distribution, and other local&#13;
community initiatives. .&#13;
5.13  The first level of monitoring reports would be from kabupaten level PIMPROs to&#13;
the Provincial Project Secretariat. These reports would be prepared monthly and used to&#13;
respond immediately to any problems encountered in implementing the project activity.&#13;
The second level of monitoring would be on the physical and financial progress of the&#13;
project through mandated reporting forms from the implementing agencies varying&#13;
according to the source of funding. The third level of monitoring would seek to provide&#13;
simple quantitative feedback on the performance of the five major activities of Component&#13;
B, listed in para. 5.12. Impact indicators would be included in the sub-project proposals&#13;
from the farmers or community groups, and updated yearly to provide a data base for&#13;
evaluating the financial, economic and social impact of project interventions on target&#13;
beneficiaries. The fourth and final method would be rapid appraisal monitoring. This&#13;
method is recommended as: (a) a means of direct interaction with the target population;&#13;
and (b) a useful management tool to achieve coordination among the implementing&#13;
agencies. Rapid appraisal should be conducted once a year at the kabupaten level with&#13;
representation from the kabupaten Dinas, kecamatan staff, and the provincial BAPPEDA&#13;
office.&#13;
5.14  The proposed evaluation system has been designed to evaluate project outcomes in&#13;
relation to the project objectives. A three tiered system would be used consisting of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
(a)   an initial inventory or data base on income and production information at&#13;
the provincial and kabupaten levels, building on the data gathered during&#13;
project preparation;&#13;
(b)   a mid-term review after two years of project life to review progress,&#13;
identify management and technical constraints, assess development impact&#13;
and recommend adjustments in project design, as appropriate; and&#13;
(c)   a final review at project completion to evaluate the direct impact of the&#13;
project on target groups and the effectiveness of the organizational&#13;
structure and management system used in the project, and to draw&#13;
conclusions for future projects.&#13;
5.15 Project performance would be measured by project component and activity and by&#13;
project objective. Performance indicators by project component and activity are given in&#13;
Table 5.1. Success indicators for achieving the project's main objectives are as follows:&#13;
(a)   raisefarmer incomes: estimates of farm incomes during the project&#13;
baseline year, after two years, and after five years;&#13;
(b)   strengthen local level institutions: aggregate numbers of facilities&#13;
improved or newly constructed and persons trained; and&#13;
(c)   foster broad- based participation at the grassroots: aggregate numbers of&#13;
LCOs and their members involved in planning and implementation of&#13;
project activities.&#13;
Bank Supervision&#13;
5.16 As the project is geographically dispersed and involves a number of components,&#13;
some of which are pilot in nature, the Bank should schedule supervision missions initially&#13;
twice a year, starting off with project launch workshops in the two provinces. A mid-term&#13;
review is planned for the fall of 1998. Assurances have been obtained from GOI during&#13;
negotiations that a mid-term report would be submitted to the Bank by September 30,&#13;
1998, for review and discussion with GOI by October 31, 1998 and that thereafter all&#13;
necessary measures would be taken to ensure the efficient completion of the project and&#13;
the achievements of its objectives based on the conclusions and recommendations of the&#13;
mid-term review report. If progress proves satisfactory, the frequency of supervision&#13;
missions may be reduced. The Bank would rely to the extent possible on the Bank's&#13;
Resident Mission staff (RSI) to provide continuous interaction with the central and local&#13;
project agencies. A supervision plan for the project is at Annex 7. It details the mix of&#13;
specialties and frequency and duration of missions needed to ensure adequate supervision&#13;
by the Bank. In addition, RSI would conduct ex-post reviews of works completed and&#13;
goods supplied at the rate of about two staff-weeks per year.&#13;

6. PROJECT BENEFITS, AGRICULTURAL&#13;
PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FARM INCOMES&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
6.1   The project would raise smallholder incomes, promote equitable regional&#13;
development, encourage broad based participation in development, and strengthen local&#13;
level institutions in the two Nusa Tenggara provinces. The project, together with others,&#13;
would support and supplement GOI's ongoing efforts to improve the standards of living in&#13;
the country's eastern islands. The main benefits are categorized below (see Table 5.1 for&#13;
further details):&#13;
(a)   direct impact on target beneficiaies through increased agricultural&#13;
production and incomes and improved rural infrastructure, especially roads.&#13;
An estimated 75,000 households (or about 20 percent of the rural&#13;
households in the target areas) would directly benefit from participation in&#13;
some of the main interventions under Component B. After completion of&#13;
the project the number of beneficiaries would further increase due to&#13;
continued introduction of better production technology generated by&#13;
research (Component A), improvement of agricultural support services,&#13;
and redistribution of breeding cattle;&#13;
(b)   direct impact on local government institutions as some 1,000 civil&#13;
servants from the two provinces would receive short-term training and gain&#13;
practical experience from the project; and&#13;
(c)   improved capacity of local governments to plan and execute multi-&#13;
sectoral development programs using community-based planning systems.&#13;
This would allow local governments to plan better for future development,&#13;
improve future utilization of annual budget allocations and replicate the&#13;
experience of the project in other areas.&#13;
Agncultural Production&#13;
6.2   Farm Models. Estimates of incremental crop production have been based on two&#13;
farm models representing, respectively, (a) some 30,000 farms with an average size of 0.5&#13;
ha irrigated land served by a total of about 200 farmer-managed village irrigation systems,&#13;
and (b) about 17,600 farms with an average size of 0.75 ha rainfed land which are the&#13;
focus of the pilot component on dryland technology. It has further been assumed that&#13;
some 10 percent of the irrigated farms and 60 percent of the dryland farms would take up&#13;
livestock keeping under the project by acquiring breeding cattle. Also, some 2,800 farm&#13;
households are projected to increase the production from their home gardens. Obviously,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
the selected farm models are simplifications of diverse situations existing in the field. Soil&#13;
and water conditions in the project areas and cultural preferences of the people are the&#13;
determinant factors in the choice of farming systems. The selected models obscure large&#13;
variations in climatic conditions and productive potentials in the two provinces and within&#13;
islands. Also, there will be large differences in the time periods farmers will need to adopt&#13;
improved cultivation practices, in some cases continuing beyond the project horizon and&#13;
necessitating the making of assumptions for the purpose of quantifying project benefits.&#13;
Any new option involving substantial cash outlays for inputs will require convincing&#13;
evidence of its attractiveness. Yet, the models capture the essentials of the prospects for&#13;
improving agriculture in Nusa Tenggara. Generally, a conservative stance has been&#13;
maintained for the projections of future production.&#13;
6.3   Improvements in Productivity. With regard to village imgaton the model&#13;
assumes that physical improvements to the schemes (diversion weirs, field canals, etc.)&#13;
already have been made, in particular under the recently completed NTASP, GOI's&#13;
ongoing Village Irrigation Improvement program, and the Asian Development Bank&#13;
supported Farmer-Managed Irrigation Sector project. As a result of those projects, water&#13;
supply in the affected schemes becomes more reliable and often more plentiful. This&#13;
would permit some increases in cropping intensity, on average from less than 100 percent&#13;
to 120 percent or more, through the introduction of a second irrigated rice crop in part of&#13;
the scheme areas, or the expansion of palawija crops such as soybeans. The present&#13;
project would follow up on the infrastructure improvements with field demonstrations and&#13;
extension of improved production practices (HYV seeds, fertilizers, etc). The&#13;
demonstrations are expected to result in modest additional increases of the crop yields for&#13;
paddy (from an estimated 3.5 ton to 4.0 ton/ha), soybeans (from 0.9 ton to 1.2 ton/ha),&#13;
and other palawija crops.&#13;
6.4   For d&amp;yland crops the model assumes a cropping intensity of about 85 percent&#13;
without the project. The crops are mostly upland rice or maize, and beans (mungbeans,&#13;
soybeans, etc.). The project would give the farmers the means to diversify into&#13;
commercial tree crops (mainly cashew, cocoa and coffee), fodder/fuel trees, and grass.&#13;
They would also be encouraged to intensify food crop cultivation. The model assumes an&#13;
increase in cropping intensity to about 135 percent. This increase would occur gradually,&#13;
allowing sufficient time for the farmers to test the recommended new practices. Maize&#13;
yields would increase from 1.5 to about 2.5 ton/ha for farmers who would adopt the use&#13;
of hybrid seeds and application of basic fertilizer dosages (Model 2), but only about 1.6&#13;
ton/ha for those who would not (Model 1). Mungbean yields would increase by about 50&#13;
percent from 600 to 700 kg (Model 1) or 900 kg/ha (Model 2). Cashew trees would start&#13;
yielding 1 kg dry raw nuts/tree from year 6, increasing to about 7.5 kg nuts/tree by year 11&#13;
(Models I and 2); the average farmer would have about 25 trees.&#13;
6.5   The house plot crop model assumes a decrease in the cultivation of cassava and an&#13;
increase in the planting of mangoes, jackfruit, vanilla, ginger and lamtoro. Yields of food&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
crops (maize) are expected to increase by about 25 to 3 5 percent due to modest use of&#13;
cash inputs and better cultivation practices.&#13;
6.6   In livestock keeping, improved cattle feeding practices and better health care are&#13;
expected to (a) increase cattle birth rates from about 55 percent to 65 percent, and&#13;
(b) decrease mortality rates from 15 percent to 8 percent for animals under one year of&#13;
age and from 3 percent to 2 percent for animals over three years. Development of a&#13;
community based system to control Newcastle disease among village chickens would&#13;
reduce chicken mortality rates substantially. Water buffaloes distributed under the project&#13;
would help relieve draft power bottlenecks.&#13;
6.7   Incremental Production. The farm models referred to above indicate a direct&#13;
project induced incremental annual production at full development, equivalent to about&#13;
3,000 ton of paddy, 9,000 ton of maize, 4,500 ton of soybeans, 1,900 ton of mungbeans,&#13;
3,300 ton of raw cashew nuts, 140 ton of mangoes and jackfruits, 10 ton of vanilla, 35 ton&#13;
of ginger, and about 1,000 head of cattle (year 10). In reality the composition of the&#13;
incremental production is likely to be far more diverse. Part of the cashew nuts would be&#13;
substituted by cocoa or coffee, while some of the mungbeans and soybeans would be&#13;
replaced by other beans and groundnuts. The value of the incremental production at fiull&#13;
development would be equivalent to about US$6.0 million per year (for details see&#13;
Annex 1, Table 1).&#13;
Marketing&#13;
6.8   In the light of the experience under NTASP, marketing of the incremental&#13;
production generated by the proposed project is not expected to cause serious difficulties.&#13;
In the ICR for NTASP'2 no reference has been made to agricultural produce marketing&#13;
problems. Food crop markets are relatively free and competitive, except for rice sold at&#13;
government guaranteed prices. A large portion of the project induced food crop&#13;
production would be consumed by the producers themselves and other local people. The&#13;
prospects for selling tree crop products (cashews, cocoa, coffee, coconuts) are good.&#13;
Following the removal of a number of restrictions on exports of cocoa and coffee in 1990&#13;
and deregulation of copra marketing and processing, the markets for tree crops have&#13;
become very competitive, with farmers receiving remunerative prices and in the case of&#13;
export crops, a large share of FOB prices. The markets do not seem to be affected&#13;
significantly by local and provincial taxes on intra-regional movements of goods and&#13;
produce.&#13;
6.9    Cattle sales for slaughter and breeding are subject to quota for inter-island exports.&#13;
Although these and other restrictions depress the farmgate prices, cattle keeping still&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40 -&#13;
appears to be viable both financially and economically (see para. 1.15 and Annex 8). A&#13;
study would be conducted during the first project year to examine the rationale and impact&#13;
of the current trade restrictions on farmers' incomes and to propose changes, where&#13;
appropriate. An assurance has been obtained from GOI during negotiations that by June&#13;
30, 1997 such study would be submitted to the Bank for review and comment.&#13;
6.10  The ICR for NTASP indicates that the full income potentials of the improvement&#13;
in irrigation facilities were not realized under NTASP in many instances, among others,&#13;
because of shortage and timely availability of good quality seeds. The proposed project&#13;
would support the production of quality seeds and seedlings by the Dinas seed farms and&#13;
nurseries, through civil works and equipment, as needed.&#13;
Farm Incomes&#13;
6.11  Net farm incomes are expected to increase as a result of improvements to the&#13;
irrigated and dryland cropping systems, cattle and poultry keeping, and intensified home&#13;
gardening - either separately or in combination with one and another. In general the core&#13;
project interventions would yield a substantial increase in net incomes when combined in a&#13;
whole farm approach.&#13;
6.12  Farm incomes for the two basic crop models are given in Table 6.1. The models&#13;
show, amongst others, that net income from 0.5 ha irrigated land would increase modestly&#13;
by about 15 percent to about US$530 equivalent when pre-project infrastructure&#13;
improvements are followed by better agricultural practices. Net incomes on 0.75 ha&#13;
dryland are expected to increase substantially from US$135 to about US$240 equivalent&#13;
at full development (year 10) with the recommended intensive cultivation of food and tree&#13;
crops, and to about US$290 equivalent if farmers would continue to use modest quantities&#13;
of fertilizers on their food crops. Net income per workday would increase modestly to&#13;
just over US$6 equivalent on irrigated land and to about US$3 on dryland farms. Further&#13;
details are given in Annex 1, Tables 2 and 3.&#13;

6.13  Farmers who keep cattle, in addition to practicing improved irrigated or dryland&#13;
cropping, would be able to supplement their net incomes. However, during the early years&#13;
cash returns from a project-supplied heifer would be irregular and far apart. Under GOI's&#13;
cattle distribution rules the farmers would be allowed to either keep or sell the first calf&#13;
(they probably would keep the females) but would have to return the second and third&#13;
calves. The first calf would be bom about two years after the arrival of the original heifer&#13;
and, if sold, be worth about US$150 equivalent one year later. Only from the sixth or&#13;
seventh year onwards would the cattle keepers be able to regularly sell (once per year with&#13;
some luck) descendants from the original heifer or her retained daughter(s). Animal&#13;
keepers other than those receiving breeding stock from the project also would benefit&#13;
because of the improvements to the animal health facilities, resulting in lower mortalities&#13;
and higher calving rates.&#13;
6.14 Net incomes from improved home gardening are expected to double from about&#13;
US$35 equivalent on a plot of 0.2 ha to about US$80 through the introduction of high&#13;
value crops such as fruit trees, vanilla and spices. The average number of work days in the&#13;
home garden would nearly double and the net income per day worked would increase&#13;
from about US$3 to nearly US$5 equivalent.&#13;

7. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND RISKS&#13;
Project Alternatives&#13;
7.1   Several design alternatives were considered during project preparation, as shown&#13;
below:&#13;
(a)   Project Scope. The original terms of reference for project preparation&#13;
covered five provinces in eastern Indonesia. Subsequently, the Bank and&#13;
GOI decided to design separate projects for two pairs of provinces, i.e. the&#13;
two Nusa Tenggaras and Central and S.E. Sulawesi, and drop the fifth&#13;
(Irian Jaya) in order to keep implementation and supervision arrangements&#13;
simple and manageable. For the same reason the project scope was&#13;
curtailed to agriculture and limited infrastructure development (roads),&#13;
excluding sectors such as health care and education;&#13;
(b)   Project Sub-components. Several proposed sub-components for&#13;
agricultural area development were dropped for various reasons. Land&#13;
titling was not included because on balance comprehensive national&#13;
coverage reflecting national priorities is preferred over fragmented regional&#13;
coverage. Goat distribution was dropped as a sub-component because&#13;
there already are a multitude of goat schemes proposed or under&#13;
implementation. Upgrading of village irrigation structures was deleted&#13;
after preappraisal because Government had just started a large-scale&#13;
Improvement of Village Irrigation Schemes Project (PID) and the Asian&#13;
Development Bank had agreed to finance a Farmer-Managed Irrigation&#13;
Sector Project. Fishponds were not included because they were not&#13;
successful under NTASP. Marine fisheries would have added complexity&#13;
while addressing only a restricted group of beneficiaries which would be&#13;
better served by a specialized project;&#13;
(c)   Planning Arrangements. The selected arrangements reflect current&#13;
insights and GOI policies on the roles of national, provincial and local&#13;
government entities. A perceptible shift is now underway from sector&#13;
operations, planned and implemented by central government agencies, to&#13;
more integrated development efforts planned and executed at the local&#13;
levels. The experience gained under NTASP and other recent projects&#13;
appears to confirm that chances of success for locally planned projects are&#13;
likely to be better; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
(d)   Implementation Arrangements. The NTASP experience confirmed the&#13;
importance of beneficiary participation in project implementation. Under&#13;
the proposed project the kabupaten Dinas would work closely together&#13;
with LCOs to further encourage beneficiary participation in the planning&#13;
and implementation of all area-based schemes.&#13;
Fiscal Implications and Cost Recovery&#13;
7.2   The proposed project's main component (B) would be implemented by the existing&#13;
provincial and kabupaten Dinas. The project would support the Dinas by training their&#13;
staff, procuring transport facilities and equipment, and paying staff honoraria and&#13;
allowances to facilitate effective implementation of all sub-components. None of these&#13;
support measures would have fiscal implications beyond the project implementation&#13;
period. Recruitment of new staff would be limited to a relatively small number of persons&#13;
to man the eleven newly constructed Poskeswan and two RECs. Construction would&#13;
proceed only after obtaining agreement from the kabupaten concerned to pay the O&amp;M&#13;
costs of the facilities. In addition, assurances have been obtained from GOI during&#13;
negotiations that fees would be charged to the users of the Poskeswan (see para. 3.18).&#13;
The impact of the new facilities on the local governments' budgets is therefore expected to&#13;
be less than five percent of their total agriculture budgets.&#13;
7.3   Farmers would have some capacity to contribute to the implementation of sub-&#13;
components, such as roads and water infrastructure, usually in the form of labor. For the&#13;
irrigated cropping, dryland cropping and home plot improvements subcomponents, the&#13;
project would provide free inputs to early adopters. This subsidy would serve the purpose&#13;
of demonstrating the merits of the chosen technology to follower adopters who would&#13;
have to pay the full costs of the inputs. The research and extension components are by&#13;
and large public goods and are not practically amenable to direct cost recovery.&#13;
7.4   During the first few years after adopting improved crop production systems, the&#13;
emphasis would be on procurement of inputs required to sustain the adopted levels of&#13;
production. Farmers would be encouraged to join hands for the procurement and&#13;
financing of inputs by setting up informal revolving funds. Once such arrangements would&#13;
have been set up, more emphasis would be given to the recovery of all relevant production&#13;
costs from the farmers, either by imposing adequate user fees, or by turning over the&#13;
provision of services to the private sector. Progress should not be forced, however, and&#13;
sufficient time should be allowed for viable practices to develop.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Poverty Impact&#13;
7.5   The proposed project is targeted at the poorer sections of the Nusa Tenggara&#13;
provinces. Project activities would be planned on the basis of demands from, and in close&#13;
consultation with, the people. Estimates of the proposed project's quantifiable benefits&#13;
indicate substantial increases of incomes for dryland farmers from about US$135 to about&#13;
US$240 equivalent and a more modest 15 percent increase to about US$530 equivalent,&#13;
for irrigated farmers (for further details see Chapter 6 and Annex 2). In addition, the&#13;
project is likely to generate substantial, but as yet not quantifiable, benefits for the people&#13;
in the targeted areas, such as better road access and improved availability of farm produce&#13;
and farm inputs.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
7.6   Treatment of Components. The project's Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was&#13;
estimated for Components B and C. For component A, agricultural research, the benefits&#13;
also would be significant but difficult to quantify. The impact of research would be long-&#13;
term in nature and would extend well beyond the project areas to the entire territories of&#13;
the two Nusa Tenggara provinces. Although calculating an ERR for the research&#13;
component would indeed be difficult, earlier analysts facing the same problem have found&#13;
it useful to relate research cost to the size of the agricultural sector in the concerned area.&#13;
For the two provinces the annual value of agricultural production, excluding forestry and&#13;
fisheries, is about US$800 million equivalent (1992). The project's research component&#13;
would cost about US$4.3 million over six years. This investment would generate an&#13;
economic rate of return of more than 50 percent if it were to prompt a one-time 0.25&#13;
percent increase in agricultural production (a conservative assumption) in the two&#13;
provinces from the third project year onwards.&#13;
7.7   No attempts were made to estimate separate ERRs for Components B and C or for&#13;
different productive sub-components because: (a) most components and sub-components&#13;
are complementary, for example cropping and cattle keeping; and (b) there are no clear-&#13;
cut ways to allocate the cost of supporting investments, e.g. road improvements, technical&#13;
assistance and training, among the separate productive activities. The cost of "other local&#13;
community initiatives" also have been excluded from the calculations because those&#13;
activities and their benefits have not been identified as yet. These costs represent about 30&#13;
percent of all area development investments, including road improvements, and about 40&#13;
percent excluding the roads. There is no reason to expect lower economic returns for&#13;
these activities than for the identified project components. Consequently, a conservative&#13;
25 percent of the overhead costs and supporting investments were excluded from the&#13;
calculations. A twenty-year time period has been assumed in the analysis.&#13;
7.8   Prices. In carrying out the analysis, the economic prices for rice, maize, soybeans,&#13;
and fertilizer were based on prices derived from World Bank international market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
projections for these commodities, adjusted for east Indonesia transport costs. The&#13;
economic price of cashew was based on a recent FAO study which projected economic&#13;
farm gate prices for this commodity in the Nusa Tenggara provinces. The economic price&#13;
of mungbeans was equated with local market prices as production of this commodity in&#13;
the target areas is not import substituting. The economic price for cattle is not a&#13;
straightforward matter, as the preferred product in Indonesia is fresh meat, rather than&#13;
frozen, and thus imports cannot serve as an indicator. Local prices were used&#13;
conservatively, as these prices are lower than the (unknown) economic price. An&#13;
experiment with a 15 percent higher price had only a very small impact on the ERR. Most&#13;
project areas are not densely populated and economic wage levels are assumed to equal&#13;
the local market wage rates which are rather low. No discount factor for labor cost was&#13;
used in the base case. However, it was deemed useful to test the ERR's sensitivity to&#13;
changes in the wage rates (see para. 7.10). A list of financial and economic prices is at&#13;
Annex 6, Table 1.&#13;
7.9   Rate of Return. The ERR of the project has been estimated at 17 percent. A&#13;
summary of the cost and benefit streams is at Annex 6, Table 2.&#13;
7.10  Sensitivity Analysis. If some of the risks alluded to in para. 7.18 were to&#13;
materialize, the effect on the project's ERR would be as indicated below:&#13;
(a)   delay of benefits (but not of costs) due to institutional or technical&#13;
implementation problems:&#13;
(i)   by 1 year : ERR 13 percent; and&#13;
(ii)   by 2 years: ERR 10 percent&#13;
(b)   decrease in overall benefit levels due to overestimation of local&#13;
governments' capacity to provide adequate project follow-up support, or&#13;
because of climatic or other technical difficulties:&#13;
(i)   by 10 percent: ERR 13 percent; and&#13;
(ii)   by 20 percent: ERR 9 percent&#13;
(c)   decrease in benefit levels for the dryland crop component if a proportion of&#13;
the farmers would abandon the recommended new technology after two&#13;
years and revert to the traditional practices: percentage of dryland farmers&#13;
reverting:&#13;
(i)   fifty percent: ERR 13 percent; and&#13;
(ii)   seventy-five percent: ERR 11 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46 -&#13;
(d)    decrease in benefit levels for the livestock component resulting from a&#13;
slower reduction of mortality rates for 0-2 year old cattle due to climatic or&#13;
institutional constraints as follows:&#13;
(i)    0 - 1 year old calves mortality 11 percent instead of 8 percent; and&#13;
(ii)    1 - 2 year old heifers mortality 6 percent instead of 5 percent:&#13;
ERR 16 percent (slight decrease from 16.71 to 16.39 percent).&#13;
7.11   Another sensitivity test conducted concerns the price of labor. A case could&#13;
perhaps be made for lower than market opportunity costs for labor given the overall state&#13;
of poverty in the project areas and the lack of other productive opportunities. The effect&#13;
on the project's ERR would be relatively small: (a) a 1.4 percent increase if the&#13;
opportunity cost of labor were decreased from Rp 2,000 per day to Rp 1,500 per day; and&#13;
(b) a further 1.4 percent increase (to 19.5 percent) if the opportunity cost of labor would&#13;
be reduced to Rp 1,000 per day.&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
7.12   Environmental Screening. Proposed project interventions have been screened in&#13;
order to identify their impact on the environment. Main characteristics are summarized&#13;
below:&#13;
(a)    vilage irrigadon systems already have been physically upgraded before the&#13;
start of the proposed project, or are being improved simultaneously, under&#13;
separate arrangements outside the framework of the proposed project. Those&#13;
improvement works would entail construction of permanent weirs, intake&#13;
structures, and primary canals to improve the efficiency of water use by farrners&#13;
on existing paddy fields. As a result there would be a marginal expansion of&#13;
cultivated areas in some of the schemes. This would not involve land clearing&#13;
since, typically, land adjacent to the schemes already is used for rainfed&#13;
cropping. The proposed project's intervention in the schemes is limited to&#13;
demonstrations of improved cropping and livestock practices, including the use&#13;
of improved seeds, modest quantities of fertilizers, and small amounts of&#13;
pesticides;&#13;
(b)    drylandfarming actvities would be located in upland areas with slopes from 8&#13;
percent to 25 percent. Typically, these areas are used for shifting cultivation&#13;
and grazing, and, in the absence of conservation practices, may suffer from&#13;
surface erosion and deterioration of soil fertility through leaching of nutrients;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
(c)   cattle ditibuon would be preceded by training of farmers on intensive&#13;
livestock management practices. The recipients would plant forage tree crops&#13;
and establish corrals;&#13;
(d) home garden improvements would be carried out within existing settlements;&#13;
(e)   farm to market roads would involve improvement of existing tracks, trails and&#13;
village roads. No new roads would be constructed; and&#13;
(f)    ullage water supply systems may be included under "other local community&#13;
initiatives" and would involve permanent spring captures, pipelines and public&#13;
hydrants to supply clean water to existing settlements.&#13;
7.13   The predicted environmental impact of the proposed project interventions on the&#13;
main components and sub-components of the environment has been classified into three&#13;
categories: (a) possible but minor, (b) minor to moderate, and (c) major. The impact&#13;
could be either negative or positive.&#13;
(a)   Impact on the Physical Environment&#13;
(i)    Soil and Land. Project activities involving the clearing of brush,&#13;
cultivation of grasslands, and improvement of farm access roads,&#13;
are potentially harmfuil, especially where slopes exceed 8 percent.&#13;
The negative impacts in the areas concerned are classified either as&#13;
"minor to moderate", or as "possible but minor". The project&#13;
would mitigate these negative impacts by provision of correct road&#13;
alignments, use of land preparation methods with minimum topsoil&#13;
disturbance, contour planting systems, and other conservation&#13;
farming methods. After following the directions outlined above, the&#13;
overall effect of the project would be positive as the land would be&#13;
stabilized following a period of degradation under the existing&#13;
farming systems;&#13;
(ii)    Hydrology. The establishment of conservation farming systems,&#13;
would reduce run-off and improve the soil: water regime. Water&#13;
would drain from the land more uniformly and stream levels should&#13;
become more stable. Land presently supporting Imperiata&#13;
Cylindrica or a mixture of low regrowth and shifting cultivation&#13;
would show the greatest benefits and minor positive impacts are&#13;
likely in the remaining areas. No dams or reservoirs would be&#13;
constructed. However, village irrigation improvements and village&#13;
water supply from spring capture systems may result in some&#13;
reductions in the flow of area streams due to increases in usage of&#13;
water for irrigation and domestic consumption; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
(iii)    Water Quality. The acidity, BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand),&#13;
COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and color of the stream waters&#13;
are unlikely to change significantly as a result of increased fertilizer&#13;
use or small scale processing activities for estate crops.&#13;
Conservation farming would lead to reduced run-off and lower&#13;
sediment levels. Raising of the levels of sanitation in rural&#13;
households and offices would have a positive environmental impact.&#13;
Therefore impacts on water quality are positive.&#13;
(b)   Impacts on the Biological Environment&#13;
(i)    Land Use. Typical land use in the project areas includes a mixture&#13;
of low brush regrowth, Imperiata Cylindrica grasslands, and&#13;
temporary arable plots as part of shifting cultivation systems. In&#13;
these circumstances land clearing at the scale envisaged is not&#13;
environmentally damaging. Heterogeneity of vegetation may be&#13;
reduced in some secondary growth areas, but the resultant negative&#13;
impact is classified only as "possible to minor",;&#13;
(ii)    Flora and Fauna. Animal and insect populations may be slightly&#13;
reduced in number and diversity. However, no rain forest would be&#13;
removed. The agricultural development areas no longer have their&#13;
original assembly of species and in some locations considerable&#13;
simplification already has occurred because of previous farming&#13;
activities. The overall environmental effect is considered to be&#13;
positive. The endangered flora and fauna in the targeted provinces&#13;
include:&#13;
Komodo (Veranus Komodoensis);&#13;
Duyung (Dugong-Dugong);&#13;
Kakatua (Cacatua Sulphurea Citrinocrictata);&#13;
Kuskus (Phaluger Sp.); and&#13;
Sandalwood (Santalum Album).&#13;
None of the project interventions are expected to have a negative impact on&#13;
these species directly or on their habitats, nor on existing mangrove, coral reef&#13;
or sea grass areas;&#13;
(c)   Impacts on the Social, Cultural and Economic Environment&#13;
(i)    Social Aspects. No serious social or cultural tensions have been&#13;
reported in the target areas. Project design provides for the direct&#13;
involvement of the local communities in planning and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
implementation of project activities. It is not anticipated that any&#13;
induced socio-economic change would result in a significant&#13;
deterioration of current social values. Adoption of new technology&#13;
by the project participants would be on a voluntary basis; and&#13;
(ii)    Cultural Aspects. None of the target areas appear to include&#13;
locations of major monuments of archaeological significance.&#13;
Cultural habits and customs reflect a pattern of life that centers on&#13;
small scale farming activities. The project interventions would not&#13;
change this basic lifestyle, but aim to create a more sustainable&#13;
pattern of land use and provide technological options for&#13;
improvement of water supply, sanitation, grain storage, etc.&#13;
7.14 Environmental Mitigating Procedures. The environmental impact of the&#13;
project interventions is predominantly positive. Most negative impacts occur during the&#13;
physical construction period. The mitigating procedures recommended for potentially&#13;
environmentally negative project activities are summarized below:&#13;
(a)   Farm Road Construction. In steeply sloping areas roads would be&#13;
aligned so as to minimize erosion effects. Exposed land areas where heavy&#13;
run-off is expected, should be planted with cover crops;&#13;
(b)   Land Clearing. The scale of land clearing is small and would be carried&#13;
out only on individual farm plots where the existing vegetation is bush or&#13;
grass. Ground cover would be quickly re-established after clearing;&#13;
(c)   Tree Crop Planting. Low density tree plantings are recommended in all&#13;
areas in order to permit intercropping of food crops. The extension&#13;
services would encourage smallholders to intensify food crop cultivation in&#13;
areas which are best suited for sustained cropping;&#13;
(d)   Pest Control. Proposed pest control measures under the project are&#13;
consistent with the recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture. The&#13;
Government has agreed with the Bank to implement by August 1997 an&#13;
action plan for regulatory and environmental management of pesticides&#13;
(Integrated Pest Management Training Project, Loan 3586-IND).&#13;
Chemical control of wild pigs is not recommended as this may present a&#13;
threat to the people and other wildlife in the region;&#13;
(e)   Construction of Project Facilities. The facilities would only be constructed&#13;
on non-forest lands. Septic tanks would be constructed for all facilities to&#13;
dispose off waste water; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
(f)    Water Management. The potential impact of village irrigation and&#13;
potable water supply systems on surrounding areas would be examnined&#13;
carefully in consultation with all users to determine optimal levels of water&#13;
use and fair sharing arrangements in order to preclude potential conflicts.&#13;
7.15  Funding would be allocated for environmental monitoring for the duration of&#13;
project implementation. BAPPEDA Tk.I and Tk.II in each province would work closely&#13;
with the kabupaten Dinas concerned to monitor field activities posing potential risks to the&#13;
local environment.&#13;
Gender Aspects&#13;
7.16 Women in the rural areas of Nusa Tenggara play a central role in agricultural&#13;
activities, in addition to child rearing, cooking and other household tasks. Women also do&#13;
much of the work for food crop growing and in the family house plots. They are&#13;
frequently involved in harvesting, processing and marketing of estate crops. In addition,&#13;
women are normally responsible for small livestock (chickens and ducks), less involved&#13;
with goats and pigs (Nusa Tenggara Timur only) and not usually involved in the&#13;
husbandry of larger animals (cattle and water buffaloes). In all areas, women are reported&#13;
to be the treasurer of the household funds. Women play a significant role in agriculture&#13;
but have not received specialized training to enable them to work better and more&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
7.17 The characterization of Agro-ecological Zones to be conducted by NAIAT staff&#13;
during the first two project years (para. 3.8) would include investigations of gender&#13;
specific and non-gender specific activities. It would also include an analysis of priorities,&#13;
constraints, opportunities and potential for improving productivity of farming systems&#13;
within specific gender roles. Avoiding inequitable access to resources and preventing&#13;
inequitable transfers of labor are a special concern, particularly increases in the labor&#13;
burden of segments of the population that are already over-employed. On the other hand,&#13;
special efforts would be made to include women and other identified target groups in&#13;
mainstream activities through gender analysis training for research and extension staff and&#13;
the carrying out of gender analysis studies to identify technologies and agricultural&#13;
production systems targeted for women, involvement of women in on-farm trials, post-&#13;
harvest processing, technology testing, marketing studies, small enterprise development,&#13;
etc. Collaborative activities would be established with existing national and regional&#13;
women's organizations, including informal organizations, to identify opportunities for&#13;
increasing women's involvement in agricultural development activities consistent with&#13;
their active role in the agriculture sector. More opportunities to support and optimize&#13;
their important contribution and to enhance their economic status would be identified by&#13;
their increased involvement. Preference for selecting community development schemes&#13;
would be given to proposals involving women and youth groups. Participation of women&#13;
in the various project activities would be monitored in the M&amp;E program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
7.18   Three risks have been identified and taken into consideration in project fornulation&#13;
and design:&#13;
(a)    Capacity of the Local Government Agencies. Sub-standard capabilities of&#13;
the local Dinas continues to be a risk, as under the previous project. According&#13;
to the ICR, NTASP strengthened the local, provincial and national level&#13;
institutions in their respective roles in planning, implementing, and coordinating&#13;
decentralized and multi-sectoral interventions. The ICR also noted that the&#13;
focus on implementation through the existing administration structure at the&#13;
provincial, kabupaten and kecamatan levels, and a systematic effort for using&#13;
the project area local community organizations, were important aspects of&#13;
project implernentation. Further strengthening of local institutions is needed&#13;
under the proposed project in order to avoid unnecessary implementation&#13;
delays and minimize the risk of poor performance. The project therefore&#13;
provides for training of agency staff and commnunity leaders, procurement of&#13;
field facilities, and employment of technical assistance for project&#13;
implementation. These support activities would be undertaken during the early&#13;
project years to provide a sound basis for planning and implementation of area&#13;
development activities. The volume, scale and complexity of project&#13;
interventions would be planned from year to year on the basis of a realistic&#13;
assessment of institutional capacities, both in the local Dinas and the&#13;
participating LCOs;&#13;
(b)    Organizational Structure. Institutional complexity of the proposed project&#13;
is another risk and may, together with weaknesses of local Dinas (referred to&#13;
above), cause implementation delays. This risk is reduced by assigning clear&#13;
responsibilites to the various agencies and by using the emisting organizational&#13;
structures, operational procedures (which may be improved under the project),&#13;
and coordination arrangements. Technical assistance would help improve the&#13;
project management during the early stages of implementation, and&#13;
(c)    Adverse Local Conditions. Extended seasonal droughts can cause severe&#13;
damage, imposing serious risks on project-supported crop and livestock&#13;
activities. Drought resistance would probably be the most important criterion&#13;
for successfully introducing improved crop husbandry practices. Proper&#13;
phasing of activities (emphasizing moisture retention) and providing good&#13;
planting materials and breeding stock, would be the key elements of farm&#13;
assistance packages geared to rinimizing the potential damage from droughts.&#13;
Related to the physical limitations is the occurrence of wide-spread poverty&#13;
among the rural population and their virtual inability to buy cash farm inputs.&#13;
A key lesson of NTASP, reflected in the design of the present project, is that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
cash outlays for improved farning should be mnmized as much as possible,&#13;
especially in the early stages of development. Meanwhile, the project would&#13;
support the experimenting with revolving fund schemes, encouraging farmers&#13;
to jointly procure and finance farm inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53 -&#13;

(i)   staffing levels;&#13;
(ii)   estimates and sources of annual funding requirements to support&#13;
successful operation;&#13;
(ini)    expected benefits to area farmers; and&#13;
(iv)    planned types and levels of user fees or other cost recovery&#13;
systems, if applicable (para. 3.18);&#13;
(d)   beneficiaries of the cattle and buffalo distribution programs would return&#13;

- 54 -&#13;
(f)    Government and its agencies would comply with the reporting and auditing&#13;
requirements as specified in para. 4.16;&#13;
(g)   a PMU with competent staff in adequate numbers would be maintained in&#13;
each participating kabupaten until completion of the project (para. 5.4);&#13;

(i)   not later than September 30 each year, a coordinated work program&#13;
and cost estimates for the project for the following fiscal year; and&#13;
(ii)   by December 31 each year, a coordinated budget proposal for the&#13;
agreed provincial work programs (para. 5.10);&#13;
(i)    Government would submit to the Bank by September 30, 1998 a mid-term&#13;
review report for review and discussion with the Borrower by October 31,&#13;
1998, and thereafter take all necessary measures to ensure the efficient&#13;
completion of the project and the achievements of its objectives, based on&#13;
the conclusions and recommendations of the mid-term review report (para.&#13;
5.16); and&#13;
'i)    a study to examine the impact of current cattle trade restrictions on&#13;
farmers' incomes and to propose changes, where appropriate, would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank for review and comment by June 30, 1997 (para.&#13;
6.9).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
8.2   Subject to the above agreements, the project would be suitable for a loan of&#13;
US$27.0 million equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia for 20 years, including a grace&#13;
period of five years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
NUSA TENGGARA AGRICULTURAL AREA&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Naibonat Assessment Institute for Agricultural Technology&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The main body for agricultural research in Indonesia is the Agency for Agricultural&#13;
Research and Development (AARD) which was established by Presidential Decree in&#13;
1974. AARD is designated to coordinate, manage, and conduct agricultural research and&#13;
development throughout Indonesia through the direct management of sixteen research&#13;
institutes located throughout the country and through playing a coordinating role with a&#13;
further ten institutes conducting research on estate crops. To adapt to the changing&#13;
demands of the agricultural sector, AARD is being reorganized (1995 Ministerial&#13;
Decree). The objective is to: (a) improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of research&#13;
and development (R&amp;D) through decentralization of services to the regions, and (b) focus&#13;
on specific agro-ecological zones (AEZ) and resource-based development generating&#13;
location-specific technologies. This also would help achieve a more balanced&#13;
development between regions. In addition, R&amp;D activities would focus on market oriented&#13;
and demand driven technologies to serve the changing needs of both farmers and&#13;
consumers for higher quality and more diversified products.&#13;
2.    Within the regional framework, the strategy will aim to generate location specific&#13;
technologies using a farrning systems approach (FSR). This would be achieved by five&#13;
main related activities:&#13;
(a)   regional problem identification through better research-extension-farmer&#13;
linkages;&#13;
(b)   closer collaboration between research and extension to adapt, refine and&#13;
repackage technologies to meet local farmers needs;&#13;
(c)   technical demonstrations which would link researchers, extension workers&#13;
and farmers closer together;&#13;
(d)   organization of field days; and&#13;
(e)   production of materials and information which meet and recognize the&#13;
absorptive capacity and educational level of the farmers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
This departure from a previous strong sector based and centrally managed approach to&#13;
research would demand closer collaboration and coordination between research staff and&#13;
provincial government staff (particularly extension), members of the private sector&#13;
(including NGOs), as well as creating stronger links with regional universities (for specific&#13;
research topics and training).&#13;
3.    Action has been taken to reorient the mandates of 15 commodity research&#13;
institutes of which: five are involved with food crops; three in horticulture; three in&#13;
industrial crops; two in livestock; and three in fisheries. All of the substations of these&#13;
national research institutes will be fully integrated into the new Assessment Institutes for&#13;
Agricultural Technology (AIAT). At the regional level, 17 AIATs will be established&#13;
under the Center for Agricultural Socio-Economic Research (CASER). These AIATs will&#13;
be staffed by AARD research staff from existing research stations and substations already&#13;
deployed in the regions, existing personnel from the former Agricultural Information&#13;
Centers (which are all to be integrated in the AIATs) and AARD staff to be relocated to&#13;
the regions from the national research institutes. Each AIAT will have a Regional&#13;
Advisory Committee chaired by the head of MOA's regional coordinating office&#13;
(KANWIL) and co-chaired by the head of BAPPEDA with members drawn from various&#13;
Dinas, local universities, research institutes, farmer groups and the private sector. The&#13;
Regional Advisory Committee will guide the AIAT on the R&amp;D program, priorities and&#13;
policies and will be assisted by Regional Technical Working Groups drawn from the&#13;
various agencies.&#13;
Bank Involvement in Agricultural Research&#13;
4.    Bank support to AARD began in 1975 with the Agricultural Research and&#13;
Extension Project (Loan 1179-IND) for US$21.5 million of which US$16.7 million was&#13;
for research. The project strengthened production oriented research programs for rice,&#13;
palawija crops, highland vegetables and rubber through provision of buildings, equipment,&#13;
training and technical assistance. Support to AARD continued with the National&#13;
Agricultural Research Project (Loan 1840/Cr. 1014-IND) for US$65.0 million which&#13;
placed more emphasis on crops other than rice (lowland vegetables, livestock, fisheries,&#13;
forestry and estate crops other than rubber). To address perceived deficiencies in&#13;
management and research planning, the Bank then supported the Agricultural Research&#13;
Management Project (ARM I, Loan 303 1-IND) for US$35.3 million which was designed&#13;
to strengthen research planning and management. In addition, AARD has received Bank&#13;
support for specific research components included in other projects (including NTASP),&#13;
particularly in transmigration, swamp and upland area development.&#13;
5.    In 1995 the Bank agreed to support the Second Agricultural Research&#13;
Management Project (ARM II, Loan 3886-IND), which has the overall objective of&#13;
strengthening regional research and development, ensuring location-specific technology,&#13;
emphasizing market oriented and client driven technology packages, and improving the&#13;
delivery of research recommendations to end users. The major focus will be on the phased&#13;
establishment and operation of a network of AIATs (in 12 provinces) in the new regional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
network of 17 AIATs. General support to cover all 17 AIATs will assist strengthening of&#13;
the regional management and planning capability and more specific program support will&#13;
be provided to eight individual AIATs. In addition, research management reforms will&#13;
continue to be implemented, a bottom-up planning and priority setting procedure will be&#13;
established, and Indonesian access to internationally generated technologies and germ&#13;
plasm would be strengthened through improved collaboration with national agencies and&#13;
international research centers. Total project cost is US$101.8 million of which the Bank&#13;
loan is US$63.0 million. The Project has commenced in June 1995 and will be&#13;
implemented over six years.&#13;
The NTASP Experience&#13;
6.    The research component of NTASP established a main research station at&#13;
Naibonat, close to Kupang on NTT, and two installations located at Maumere on Flores&#13;
and Sandubaya on Lombok. The program of work commenced with a study of farming&#13;
systems in NTT and NTB which was to provide the basis for applied farming systems&#13;
research and on-farm trials to define FSR technology packages. Subsequently, a program&#13;
of applied research was carried out and eight technology packages were defined. These&#13;
packages are: (a) technology package for rainfed paddy; (b) house plot technology; (c)&#13;
package for the critical land of Bobonaro clay; (d) dryland technology; (e) irrigated rice&#13;
production; (f) livestock improvement; (g) food crop technology; and (h) cotton based&#13;
technology.&#13;
7.    The establishment of the FSR base in NTT and NTB represented the first serious&#13;
attempt to develop a program of cross-sectoral farming systems research in the outer&#13;
islands of Indonesia. The program can claim success in identifying and, to a certain&#13;
extent, overcoming the considerable organization and management constraints associated&#13;
with this multi-disciplinary approach. This success is reflected in the ARM II project&#13;
which seeks to replicate the FSR methodology, pioneered under NTASP, in the 17 new&#13;
AIATs.&#13;
8.    Despite this qualified success, there were some serious weaknesses and limitations&#13;
in the FSR program completed under NTASP. These, and the lessons learned, can be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   despite the setting of general objectives, there was from the outset a lack of&#13;
a clear definition of objectives, priorities and policies for research.&#13;
Constraints affecting low income farmer production in the region were not&#13;
fully identified and research programs failed to respond to these important&#13;
limiting factors. The establishment of linkages and the seeking of&#13;
assistance at an early stage of the project from an international body such&#13;
as ISNAR or an International Research Center (ICRISAT, CIMMYT,&#13;
IRRI, IITA) would have identified and reduced this risk;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
(b)   comprehensive and representative baseline data were not collected prior to&#13;
commencement of the adaptive research activities and this prevented a&#13;
detailed analysis of existing farming systems. Although the low income&#13;
farmer was the target, the main factors limiting production at the&#13;
subsistence level were not responded to in a systematic manner. These&#13;
included farm inputs (tools, seeds, fertilizer and draft power),&#13;
environmental aspects (drought proneness, erratic rainfall and porous&#13;
soils), financial access (credit), and marketing outlets. In addition,&#13;
insufficient analysis was made of the social-anthropological factors which&#13;
limit the absorptive capacity and restrain the ability of low input farmers to&#13;
change farming practices throughout the eastern islands;&#13;
(c)   routine analysis of costs and benefits of existing farmer production systems&#13;
(particularly irrigation) was not carried out and a comparison with the&#13;
improved "with project" recommendations was not completed;&#13;
(d)   as a consequence of the lack of detailed definition of the agro-ecological&#13;
zones which characterize farming systems in the islands, suitable&#13;
technology packages which respond to these local differences were not&#13;
identified. The packages which were promoted were based on technology&#13;
developed elsewhere and imported to the eastern islands; the FSR therefore&#13;
acted more as a conduit for national research findings rather then&#13;
establishing its own technology. An example of this is the excessively high&#13;
average costs of inputs (Rp 1.17 million per hectare) for food crops in the&#13;
recommended packages. Given the low level of savings and incomes, the&#13;
absence of formal credit, the drought prone nature of the soils, and&#13;
dominance of food security as a prime objective of the subsistence farmers,&#13;
it is not surprising that the adoption rates were low and the packages&#13;
clearly were not sustainable. No attempt was made to start with low input-&#13;
low cost technology and build the confidence of the farmers on a step-by-&#13;
step basis;&#13;
(e)   although demonstrations were established in farmers fields, these were&#13;
implemented by research staff providing the high input packages on a grant&#13;
basis. There was little involvement of the extension (PPL) staff and&#13;
farmers. More impact would have been achieved if farmers and extension&#13;
staff were more involved in the planning and implementation of these&#13;
demonstrations and an element of cost recovery (such as provision of labor&#13;
by farmers) would have sharpened the impact. FSR activities cut across&#13;
four Dinas (food crops, estate crops, livestock and fisheries) and better&#13;
coordination and collaboration between FSR staff and Dinas staff would&#13;
have increased the relevance and impact of these demonstrations; and&#13;
(f)   the technical assistance support for the FSR of NTASP addressed mainly&#13;
sectoral issues (cotton, livestock and estate crops) and was not used&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  9-                           ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
effectively to assist FSR staff to define program priorities and develop&#13;
training schedules.&#13;
9.    The experience gained under the FSR program of NTASP will provide a good&#13;
starting point for further valuable adaptive research to be implemented by staff located at&#13;
the newly created Naibonat Assessment Institute for Agriculture Technology (NAIAT).&#13;
The problems and lessons learned from analysis of the NTASP experience will be&#13;
addressed in the proposed new project through a combination of the following:&#13;
(a)   the formulation of a regional research master plan (funded under ARM II)&#13;
and closer collaboration with national and international research bodies&#13;
would improve the definition of priorities and policies and ensure that&#13;
objectives are better met;&#13;
(b)   a more detailed definition of agro-ecological zones would aid the&#13;
identification of constraints facing regional farmers;&#13;
(c)   strengthening of social and economic inputs would improve quantification&#13;
of data and place more emphasis on the development of low input, location&#13;
specific technology; and&#13;
(d)   technical assistance would be focused to strengthen the management&#13;
capability of the FSR staff and to assist with local problem solving.&#13;
Proposed Developments&#13;
10.   The main objective of the research component would be to develop location-&#13;
specific technology in close participation with farmers and extension staff. The support by&#13;
the project would improve the capacity of the newly established NAIAT to carry out&#13;
applied farming systems research, it would strengthen management and planning&#13;
capability, facilitate technology transfer, and would strengthen R&amp;D linkages with the&#13;
private sector, local government departments, local universities and, internationally, would&#13;
establish linkages with relevant international research centers. Agro-ecological zones&#13;
would be more closely defined and technology packages developed and refined to meet&#13;
the needs and aspirations of the low income farmers. Specifically, support would be&#13;
provided for: (a) establishment and operation of NAIAT; (b) definition of agro-ecological&#13;
zones; (c) staff resources development, technical assistance and R&amp;D collaboration; and&#13;
(d) on-farm trials and demonstrations.&#13;
11.   Establishment and Operation of NAIAT. The ARM II project will provide&#13;
general support for all 17 of the AIATs and more specific support for eight of those (for&#13;
full details see the SAR for ARM II of April 1995). General support would include&#13;
common activities to: (a) develop a regional MIS network; (b) strengthen regional&#13;
research planning and management including priority setting, monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                           ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
and development of regional R&amp;D master plans; (c) improve regional financial&#13;
management and administrative procedures, such as accounting, auditing and technical&#13;
audit; (d) improve research station management; and (e) provide support for the&#13;
implementation of the ARM II project. The eight AIATs receiving additional specific&#13;
support under ARM II do not include the Naibonat AIAT, as it would be supported under&#13;
the proposed project. Specific support would include construction of a new laison office&#13;
in Kupang on Timor (NTT) and a small laboratory at Mataram on Lombok (NTB). Also&#13;
at Mataram, part of the existing installation of NAIAT would be converted to a liaison&#13;
office. A seed cold storage unit and drying floor would be constructed at Naibonat (NTT)&#13;
and an irrigation system for about 50 ha installed at the Livestock Research Station&#13;
located at Lili (near Kupang) on NTT. New staff housing would be constructed at&#13;
Mataram. Basic furniture and laboratory equipment would be included for these new&#13;
installations. Computer systems would be located at Naibonat (Kupang), Maumere&#13;
(Flores), Sandubaya and Mataram (Lombok). Journals, periodicals and textbooks would&#13;
be updated at the libraries of the main station and installations. Likewise, vehicles would&#13;
be located at the main station and installations and, a boat at Maumere on Flores.&#13;
12.   Definition of Agro-Ecological Zones. The characterization of agro-ecological&#13;
zones has been identified as a priority research topic under the ARM II project for eight&#13;
selected AIATs. For NTT and NTB the proposed project would support the definition of&#13;
agro-ecological zones with the same objectives and procedures applied under the ARM II&#13;
project. This support would build on the existing data and knowledge of the two&#13;
provinces and would enable more detailed characteristics of the agro-ecological zones to&#13;
be prepared during the first three years of the project. Data already exist in the form of&#13;
reconnaissance soil surveys and climatic information but this needs to be defined in more&#13;
detail for activity zones and combined with information on the social, cultural and ethnical&#13;
characteristics of the zones. These studies would be implemented by research staff&#13;
working with local provincial government staff, members of local community&#13;
organizations (LCOs) and staff of local universities. The findings would form the basis of&#13;
the more location-specific definition of constraints and potential facing the farmers and&#13;
would assist in the formulation of low input technology packages.&#13;
13.   Staff Resources Development, Technical Assistance and R&amp;D Coflaboration.&#13;
The new regional AIAT focus will require considerable reorientation and staff retraining&#13;
who, up to now, have been mainly working in commodity oriented component research.&#13;
Staff training would include training within Indonesia to masters, doctorate and short-&#13;
term non-degree or diploma training to strengthen staff capability in specific skills to&#13;
effectively implement the R&amp;D. Technical assistance has been reduced from the level&#13;
proposed during preparation in recognition of the high level of qualified and experienced&#13;
staff available within AARD and the Naibonat AIAT. The technical assistance&#13;
component, comprising both international and local consultants, would assist in&#13;
strengthening the capability of NAIAT staff in technical and technology transfer fields.&#13;
Intemational consultants would be recruited for farming systems expertise (eight staff-&#13;
months) and for unallocated, short-term expertise (10 staff-months). Local consultants&#13;
would be FSR, agricultural economics, soil and water conservation, sociology, technology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

diffusion, and laboratory training (66 staff-months). To ensure that the NAIAT research&#13;
staff form strong links with international research institutes, funds have been included for&#13;
R&amp;D collaboration with bodies such as ICRISAT, CIMMYT, IRRI, and IITA. The&#13;
prospects would be explored for the establishment of a twinning arrangement between&#13;
NAIAT and one of these centers. Similarly, funds are included for collaboration with local&#13;
university staff to undertake specific topic surveys and field research.&#13;
14.   On-farm Trials and Demonstrations. This will cover all of the on-farm and&#13;
applied field trial and demonstrations to be implemented and/or supervised by staff of&#13;
NAIAT. In addition, the project would support the technology transfer of identified&#13;
packages and recommendations through organization of field days, leaflet and poster&#13;
production, slides and video processing (included in the functions of the former&#13;
Agricultural Information Centers), workshops and publication of research findings.&#13;
NAIAT staff field work would include experimental trials to test new technology under&#13;
farmer and field station conditions (component research). This would be followed by on-&#13;
farm demonstrations of new technology packages, implemented by NAIAT staff working&#13;
closely with PPLs (extension staff), LCOs and selected farmers. A program of 680 ha of&#13;
dryland farming demonstrations would be supported under the proposed project. The&#13;
third stage of general replication would be implemented by field extension staff of the&#13;
relevant Dinas working with farmers and, where available, LCO field staff.&#13;
Priority Research Programs&#13;
15.   Between 1987 and 1994, basic component technology and farming systems&#13;
research was supported by NTASP at Naibonat (NTT), Maumere (NTT), and Sandubaya&#13;
(NTB). The trials included:&#13;
(a)   food crop yield trials of groundnut, soybean, maize, mungbean, cassava&#13;
and pigeon pea;&#13;
(b)   fertilizer trials, plant spacing and population, weeding control on intercrops&#13;
of palawija crops;&#13;
(c)   food crop and coconut, food crop and other industrial crops (cashew,&#13;
cocoa, cotton, etc.);&#13;
(d)   rainfed rice variety and fertilizer trials;&#13;
(e)   alley cropping using forage grasses, fodder trees and industrial crops&#13;
(coffee, cocoa and cashew); and&#13;
(f)   various intercropping trials.&#13;
16.   From these multi-locationai trials executed mainly on farmers land close to the&#13;
research bases, eight packages or recommendations were released and demonstrated to&#13;
&#13;

found shortcomings in the packages recommended for adoption under NTASP and more&#13;
basic component research is required, particularly on fertilizer response and variety&#13;
selection of rice and palawija crops. A summary of priority research topics based on these&#13;
reports is given below:&#13;
(a)   more detailed AEZ studies to design the existing farming systems and, in&#13;
particular, to quantify existing crop inputs and labor;&#13;
(b)   development of low and intermediate input-technology packages for&#13;
irrigation and dryland as first-step adoptions for low income, risk-prone&#13;
farmers;&#13;
(c)   continued emphasis on soil and water conservation practices which are&#13;
tailored to suit both different agro-ecological zones and land availability of&#13;
individual farmers;&#13;
(d)   development of drought tolerant upland crop varieties and farming systems&#13;
designed to mitigate food security worries of farmers;&#13;
(e)   selection and testing of locally adapted varieties of crops (for example,&#13;
sorghum and maize varieties from Sumba Island) leading to improved seed&#13;
lines of these popular strains;&#13;
(f)    quantification of village irrigation benefits and optimization of irrigated&#13;
cropping systems with realistic farmer input levels;&#13;
(g)   integration of livestock feed resources, particularly dry season fodder,&#13;
within the food crop based farming system;&#13;
(h)   identification and alleviation of post-harvest crop loss factors affecting rice&#13;
and palawija crop storage;&#13;
(i)    development of simple, integrated pest management models for adoption&#13;
by farmers;&#13;
(j)   selection and testing of locally available fodder trees and grasses for&#13;
inclusion in alley cropping, fencing and contour bunds;&#13;
(k)   identification and selection of suitable cover crops for use during the dry&#13;
season on annually cropped land and as a fallow crop on shifting cultivation&#13;
lands;&#13;

17.   The AARD already has identified six priority topics for research to be carried out&#13;
at NAIAT during 1995/96. These include livestock feed resources, low input lowland rice&#13;
research, alley cropping, low income dryland crop research, socio-economic studies, and&#13;
marine fish culture studies. Although these general topics would address some of the&#13;
more specific research recommerndations given above, more detailed incorporation into&#13;
annual work plans and programs would be required under the proposed project.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
18.   The proposed project would support agricultural research over a six-year period.&#13;
The NAIAT would be staffed by the existing personnel from the former NTASP research&#13;
institute, complemented by staff from the former Agricultural Information Centers.&#13;
Additional expertise not available within the existing staff would be provided from other&#13;
AARD national centers. An overall regional development master plan and a detailed&#13;
program of work for the first project year would be prepared by the Naibonat AIAT and&#13;
submitted, through AARD, prior to commencement of the proposed project. The overall&#13;
development plan would include the priority research topics and participatory research&#13;
management mechanisms (similar to those proposed under the ARM II project) to ensure&#13;
high quality and relevance of technology to local conditions and to strengthen the linkages&#13;
of the NAIAT to farmers, local govemments, universities, the private sector and LCOs.&#13;
19.   A Regional Advisory Committee, supported by a Technical Working Group,&#13;
would assist the R&amp;D on programming, technology dissemination and training. Farmers,&#13;
provincial govemment and other participants or end users would be well represented on&#13;
these two bodies. Proposed functions of the committee, AIAT and associated agencies&#13;
are given in Attachment 1 (copied from Annex I of the SAR for ARM II). A Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) with a PIMPRO has been established at the AIAT at Naibonat,&#13;
and a PIU with a PIMBAGPRO at Sandubaya to implement the NTB portion of the&#13;
program. The PIMPRO is responsible to the Director of NAIAT for the implementation&#13;
of project activities.&#13;

DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Implementation of Agricultural Area Development&#13;
A. Village Irrigation&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Irrigated agriculture covers over five million ha in Indonesia, of which about four million ha are&#13;
under Government control and about one million ha served by farmer managed systems. Public Works&#13;
Department data of 1992 on the coverage of Desa Irigasi (village irrigation) schemes show 810&#13;
schemes with 43,000 ha in NTB and 960 schemes with 124,000 ha in NTT. The inventories are&#13;
subject to verification and updating. Information collected by the Bank's preappraisal mission for the&#13;
proposed project on the island of Sumbawa suggests that coverage of village irrigation schemes in&#13;
NTB has been underestimated in the 1992 inventory. For NTT, on the other hand, the estimates are&#13;
probably too high.&#13;
2.    Traditional village irrigation schemes usually consist of makeshift, temporary structures and&#13;
earthen canals to divert water from rivers or streams to the fields. The size of the schemes depends on&#13;
the volume of water in the streams and may vary from less than 20 ha to more than 300 ha. Some of&#13;
the schemes have water all year-around but most are seasonal, limiting irrigation to the wet season&#13;
only. Often the structures are damaged or destroyed during floods, resulting in crop losses if the wash-&#13;
out happens early in the season. In many schemes farners are forced to rebuild the structures every&#13;
year. Leakage is another problem, reducing the effectiveness of the schemes. Typically, farmers&#13;
organize themselves into infonnal groups for repair, maintenance and water management of the&#13;
schemes. Especially in NTB, the traditional irrigation organizations tend to function effictively.&#13;
The NTASP Experience&#13;
3.    Assistance for village irrigation was introduced as an NTASP activity in 1989. Responding to&#13;
requests by farrmers in NTB, project management agreed to include construction work in village&#13;
irrigation schemes in the project's Provincial Agricultural Support component. The executing agency&#13;
was the Dinas Food Crops at the kabupaten level. Schemes were selected for assistance through a&#13;
bottom-up planning process with agricultural extension workers acting as motivators and facilitators.&#13;
4.    The project supported construction of perrnanent diversion structures (weirs) through: (a)&#13;
preparation of designs, (b) supply of cement, wire and gates, and (c) assistance by skilled workmen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 2 of 19&#13;
The farmers contributed all locally available materials (sand, stone, bamboo) and their labor. The&#13;
contribution by the project was limited to Rp. 5 million (about US$2,500) for each scheme. The value&#13;
of the farmers' contributions varied considerably from scheme to scheme; on average project and&#13;
farmer contributions were about equal.&#13;
5.    Some 150 schemes were improved under NTASP, all located in NTB except for one scheme&#13;
on Sumba in NTT. The area covered by those schemes exceeds 12,000 ha. In addition to the NTASP&#13;
supported schemes, at least as many were improved using local finds, either from the provincial or&#13;
kabupaten budgets. In Kabupaten Sumbawa, for example, a total of 92 schemes were improved&#13;
between 1989 and 1993, of which 37 were financed under NTASP and 55 with local funds. Another&#13;
19 schemes were being improved during 1995, all with local finds. In all cases the local government&#13;
contribution was limited to materials and supplies which were not locally available and skilled labor.&#13;
The farmers always had full control over the planning and execution of the works - a key element of&#13;
the approach to increase the effectiveness of village irrigation schemes.&#13;
6.    As NTASP and other Government-supported improvement works have started only relafively&#13;
recently, little information has been collected as yet on the performance and benefits of the upgraded&#13;
schemes. The mid-term review team for NTASP surveyed seven schemes and found that the nature of&#13;
the benefits varied substantially between schemes, and also within schemes, depending on location. For&#13;
about one third of the surveyed farms the main benefit was a reduced risk of failure of the weir, and&#13;
hence a smaller risk of crop failure. About 40 percent of the farmers increased their cropping intensity&#13;
by taking up the cultivation of a second irrigated paddy crop. Also, in most schemes the command&#13;
area could be expanded, sometimes by up to 25 percent, allowing farmers to switch from rainfed to&#13;
irrigated paddy. However, according to the ICR, the fill potential of the improvements in the&#13;
irrigation facilities were not realized in many instances because of shortage and lack of timely&#13;
availability of good quality seeds, poor water distribution and on-farm water management due to&#13;
rudimentary secondary and tertiary channels, and in some cases due to poor access roads.&#13;
Recent Developments&#13;
7.    Under REPELITA VI the Government launched in January 1995 an ambitious three-year&#13;
program to upgrade village irrigation schemes covering some 900,000 ha, or about 90 percent of all&#13;
schemes believed to exist in the country. The program is known as Improvement of VIllage Irrigation&#13;
Schemes (PID), and sometimes also referred to as Village Irrigation Crash Program. The objective of&#13;
the program is to quickly improve diversion structures and canals in the majority of the country's&#13;
village irrigation systems (including those located in the two Nusa Tenggara provinces) and thereby&#13;
increase Indonesia's paddy production by about one million ton. The works are designed and executed&#13;
by the Public Works Department, either under contract or force account. Simukaneously, Govemnment&#13;
started in mid-1995 a Farmer-Managed Irrigation Sector Project (FEMS) with financing from the Asian&#13;
Development Bank. This six-year project covers 90,000 ha in six provinces, including Nusa Tenggara&#13;
Barat. The PID program is limited to improvement of physical infiastructure in the village schemes&#13;
while the FMIS also supports water users associations and water management activities. The PID and&#13;

FMIS programs do not include follow-up agricultural support activities to transfer improved&#13;
production technology to the farmers.&#13;
Proposed Developments&#13;
8.    Survey. In order to gain better insight in the functioning of the recently improved village&#13;
irrigation schemes, a survey of a representative sample of about 25 schemes completed under NTASP&#13;
would be undertaken during the first project year. The purpose would be to collect data on the&#13;
condition of the schemes and to determine what further support would be needed to improve their&#13;
effectiveness, both technical and agricultural. The results of the survey would be discussed with the&#13;
farmers and other interested persons and followed by the preparation of an action plan.&#13;
9.    The survey would be implemented by a two-person team consisting of an agricultural&#13;
economist and an engineer. The team would:&#13;
(a)   examine all relevant information available at the kabupaten and provincial offices on the&#13;
village irrigation schemes improved under NTASP and local government funded&#13;
programs;&#13;
(b)   select at random 25 schemes improved in NTB under NTASP, ensuing geographical&#13;
spread in the sample, and reflecting differences in sources of water, command areas,&#13;
and cropping patterns, intensities and yields; and&#13;
(c)   visit all selected schemes in order to:&#13;
(i)   assess the technical condition of all scheme facilities and determine what further&#13;
improvements, if any, are required to the headworks or the canal systems; and&#13;
(ii)   collect information from the farmers on cropping patterns and production&#13;
before and after the improvement works were performed and determine what&#13;
agricultural support services are needed in order to take full advantage of the&#13;
physical improvements.&#13;
10.   Agricultural Support Services. The project would provide follow-up agricultural support to&#13;
rehabilitated village irrigation schemes. These could include schemes improved under NTASP or one&#13;
of the programs financed with Government's own funds or by the Asian Development Bank. The&#13;
support envisaged would help realize the full potential of the physical improvements, as recommended&#13;
in the ICR for NTASP. Cropping potentials are likely to vary substantially between and within&#13;
schemes. Some schemes will allow only wet season cropping. Others, with ample water resources&#13;
throughout the year (e.g. springs), already may have two or three crops per year. In all cases the goal&#13;
would be to intensify crop cultivation by:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 4 of 19&#13;
(a)   expanding i*igated cropping during the dry season;&#13;
(b)   enlarging the command area and irigated cropping during the wet season and improve&#13;
on-farm water management;&#13;
(c)   adopting appropriate crop technologies including the use of good quality seeds, as the&#13;
risk of crop failure diminishes due to the improved facilities; and&#13;
(d)   diversifying into other crops if feasible.&#13;
The findings of the survey referred to in para 9 would be used to help improve the quality of the&#13;
agricultural support services.&#13;
11.   The Dinas Food Crops at the kabupaten level, with technical backing from the Naibonat AIAT&#13;
and the provincial agricultural services and in close consultation with the farmers, would be responsible&#13;
for implementation. Over the six project years a series of on-farm irrigated crop demonsutaions,&#13;
totaling about 5 ha per scheme would be established in about 265 village irrigation schemes. Typically&#13;
some 2.5 ha demonstrations would be established in about five 0.5 ha farm plots in each scheme during&#13;
the first year, followed by another 2.5 ha demonstrations during the second year. Dinas staff working&#13;
together with local community organizations (LCOs) operating in the project area, would identify the&#13;
irrigation schemes and select the sites for the demonstrations. They would then assist the farmer&#13;
groups with the preparation of detailed plans for implementation of the demonstrations and train the&#13;
farmer leaders in the proposed new technologies. The Dinas would arrange for the provision to the&#13;
farmers of seeds, fertilizer, tools and equipment for one cropping cycle of paddy and a palawija crop&#13;
(or a second paddy crop where water supply is adequate). Dinas and LCO staff also would encourage&#13;
the participating farmers to form groups and to set up revolving fimds for the purchase of farm inputs.&#13;
After the harvest the fund would be replenished by the participants from the sales proceeds. Each&#13;
group would set its own rules of operation. Over time, other farmers may either seek admission to an&#13;
already existing group or form new groups.&#13;
12.   Dinas and LCO staff would also assist the farmers with the preparation of proposals for&#13;
complementary interventions, including provision of cattle, assistance for seed growers, improvement&#13;
of home plots, construction of access roads, farmer training, etc. Priority would be given to&#13;
implementation of interventions in areas where village irrigation schemes have been successfally&#13;
improved.&#13;
13.   Expected Results. Paddy production is estimated to increase by about 500 kg per ha, and&#13;
soybeans by about 300 kg per ha, as a result of improved agricultural practices supported by the&#13;
project. Estimates of incremental production are in Table 1 of this Annex. A summary farm budget for&#13;
a typical 0.5 ha plot of irrigated land is given in Table 2.&#13;

B. Dryland Farming System Development&#13;
Background&#13;
14.   The two provinces NTB and NTT are among the lowest rainfall areas in Indonesia. High&#13;
precipitations of up to 3,000 mm per year have been recorded at the highest elevations but in the&#13;
coastal areas rainfall may be as low as 500 mm per year. Also, rainfall distribution over the year is&#13;
uneven. Typically, over one half of the annual rainfall occurs during the three months December -&#13;
February, and over 85 percent during the six months November - April. It hardly rains at all between&#13;
May and October and crop cultivation in the non-irigated areas is not possible during that period.&#13;
Finally, there are large year-to-year variations and drought conditions frequently prevail during&#13;
extended periods, often leading to crop losses and food shortages.&#13;
15.   Productivity and farm incomes of traditional agriculture in the dryland areas of NTB and NTT&#13;
are very low as a result of the adverse climatic conditions. Shifting cultivation in some areas is leading&#13;
to degradation of land resources. Moisture retention and soil conservation are the key requirements for&#13;
increasing agricultural productivity and preserving the resource base of the drought prone areas in&#13;
eastern Indonesia. Alley cropping, contour ridge terracing, and planting of cover crops and living&#13;
fences are forms of dryland farming techniques that have been tested and can be promoted in the target&#13;
areas. These types of interventions received much emphasis under the recently completed NTASP.&#13;
The NTASP Expenence.&#13;
16.   Approach. Under the Farming Systems Research (FSR) component of NTASP several&#13;
agricultural technology packages have been developed and are now recommended to area farmers.&#13;
These include, amongst others, packages for: (a) rain-fed paddy (ocally known as gogorancah); (b)&#13;
irrigated paddy; (c) other food crops; (d) mixed cropping for dryland; (e) house plots; and (e) livestock&#13;
keeping. Under the Land Conservation component of the project the Dinas Food Crops in seven&#13;
kabupaten established demonstrations of various conservation farming practices through the provision&#13;
of extension services, planting materials, fertilizers, hand sprayers, agro-chemicals and farm tools.&#13;
17.   Work on the development of the technology packages was started in 1986 with a base-line&#13;
survey of existing farming systems. The survey covered the three kabupaten were the research sub-&#13;
bases had been established, i.e. East Lombok (Lombok), Sikka (Flores) and Kupang (West Timor).&#13;
Up to ten main agro-ecosystems were identified during the surveys. Supplemental surveys were&#13;
conducted in 1990/91 in five additional kabupaten to complete the original project target. The&#13;
technology packages developed earlier for East Lombok, Sikka and Kupang were adjusted to render&#13;
them suitable to the conditions in the five supplemental kabupaten.&#13;
18.   During the early project years research focused on testing of component technology (especially&#13;
crop varieties and fertilizer) for food crops which was the farmers' overwhelming priority. In later&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 6 of 19&#13;
years more emphasis was given to applications of component technology in various cropping patterns&#13;
and the integration of tree legumes and tree crops. Livestock was also integrated in some of the trials.&#13;
19.   Well over 2,000 farmers were irvolved in various aspects of dryland farming improvements&#13;
through their participation in on-farm research trials and demonstrations. The land conservation&#13;
technology applied was in all cases terracing and bunding with contour planting of tree legumes, fruit&#13;
trees and other tree crops with intercropping of food crops (alley cropping). The approach has been&#13;
strengthened in the later years as specific research results became available and the resulting&#13;
recommendations of FSR have been applied in the field. After the completion of NTASP in 1994, the&#13;
Dinas Food Crops in several kabupaten, jointly with the Dinas Livestock and Dinas Estate Crops, have&#13;
continued the demonstration and extension program with local funds. Through their activities, and with&#13;
assistance from the proposed project, the benefits of research and demonstrations are expected to have&#13;
a broader impact on rural households in the two provinces.&#13;
20.   Lessons. The ICR for NTASP commented that the sustainability of the farming system&#13;
development program could be threatened unless the technology packages were further streamlined to&#13;
achieve possible cost reductions, viable arrangements for short-term financing of input costs were&#13;
made, and the institutional and infrastructural constraints to input supply and produce marketing had&#13;
been addressed. Three specific lessons have been learned from the NTASP experience. The first&#13;
lesson concems the cost of the technology packages. There is much evidence of farmers adopting only&#13;
part of the recommendations made by the researchers. The findings include:&#13;
(a)   since all farmers like to own cattle, most are willing to plant leguminous trees or fodder&#13;
plants;&#13;
(b)   where growing conditions are favorable, farmers will respond positively to the planting&#13;
of tree crops (cashews, cocoa, coffee); and&#13;
(c)   farrners either do not have the funds, or are very reluctant to spend money, on HYV&#13;
seeds, fertilizers and agro-chemicals for their food crops.&#13;
In the project trials and demonstrations the inputs were given for free to the farmers, often for up to&#13;
four or five successive years. However, it is unrealistic to expect large scale adoption of high cost&#13;
input packages, recommended by the researchers, because the farmers have very low incomes and little&#13;
savings. Indeed, there is strong evidence of farmers stopping to use high cost inputs once the trials and&#13;
demonstrations have ended. The technology packages should therefore be reviewed carefully to&#13;
detemnine whether they are suitable to the local conditions and meet the needs of the lowest income&#13;
farmers.&#13;
21.   The second lesson concerns the sequencing of various interventions, the need to fully involve&#13;
all support services and the farmers in the planning process, and the need to supply high quality seeds&#13;
and planting material, as pointed out in the ICR There have been cases were farmers were encouraged&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

to plant fodder crops on the promise that cattle would be distributed soon thereafter, while in reality&#13;
cattle were delivered too late or not at all. Lower levels of tree losses could have been achieved if the&#13;
bunded terraces had first been planted with tree legumes and vetiver in order to improve soil moisture,&#13;
instead of planting all seedlings in the same year. Preferably, farmers should first demonstrate progress&#13;
in land conservation activities. Only thereafter should the agricultural support services supply inputs&#13;
which are difficult for the farmers to obtain, such as good quality tree crop seedlings, cattle and vetiver&#13;
grass (if not locally available).&#13;
22.   A third lesson concerns the respective role of researchers and extension workers. Under&#13;
NTASP the on-farm demonstrations were managed and staffed by AARD. There only were a&#13;
relatively small number of demonstrations and all were located in the immediate vicinity of the three&#13;
research stations in Naibonat, Maumere and Sandubaya, respectively. Extension staff were not&#13;
involved in the demonstrations, other than as mere spectators. A better approach would be for&#13;
researchers to design the demonstrations and provide overall guidance while the Dinas Food Crops Tk.&#13;
II, assisted by Livestock and Estate Crops, would take care of the day-to-day management of the&#13;
demonstrations.&#13;
Proposed Developments&#13;
23.   The project would continue to support improved dryland farning practices in the project target&#13;
areas as an expanded pilot activity. The main vehicles for promoting adoption of the improved&#13;
practices would be on-farm demonstrations, conducted under the responsibility of NAIAT, and&#13;
replications by the farmers under guidance from the local agricultural support services and LCOs. For&#13;
the proposed program to be successful and sustainable, three important conditions would have to be&#13;
met. First, staff of the research and extension agencies should be well trained and motivated for their&#13;
assignments and should closely coordinate their activities amongst themselves and with the farmers.&#13;
Second, the cash input content of the recommended packages should be as small as possible since most&#13;
farmers would not be able to pay for improved seeds and fertilizers. And third, every effort should be&#13;
made to ensure that only good quality seeds, seedlings and breeding cattle are being distributed in a&#13;
timely manner to the farmers. Details on the implementation arrangements follow below.&#13;
24.   Demonstrations. The suitability of the technology packages would be tried out and&#13;
demonstrated in field demonstrations which would be established in each target area. For planning&#13;
purposes it has been assumed that about 68 on-farm demonstrations, covering a total area of about 680&#13;
ha, spread over 14 kabupaten would be established over a period of about five years. There would be&#13;
some four to five demonstrations of about 10 ha, involving about 13-14 farmers with an average 0.75&#13;
ha each, in each kabupaten over a two-year period. The NAIAT would design the demonstrations and&#13;
supervise their execution, while the Dinas Food Crops, Livestock and Estate Crops Tk. II would&#13;
manage the demonstrations on a day-to-day basis. The cost of the demonstrations would be financed&#13;
under NAIAT's annual budgets. Participating farmers would be paid up to a maximum of 50 work&#13;
days equivalent for terracing and bunding of the fields and planting of the tree crop seedlings. In&#13;
addition they would receive and initial package of improved seeds, fertilizer, agro-chemicals and tools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 8 of 19&#13;
25.   Replications. The on-farm demonstrations would be replicated throughout the target areas.&#13;
The kabupaten agricultural support services, the NAIAT researchers and representatives of the farmers&#13;
in the target area (usually a kecamatan) would meet at least once per year to discuss and agree on best&#13;
practices and to draw up annual programs of replications. For planning purposes it has been assumed&#13;
that the replication program would cover on average about 400 farmers cultivating about 300 ha (0.75&#13;
ha per farmer) in each kecamatan. About 12,600 ha would be supported under this program during the&#13;
life of the project. It is expected that successful demonstrations and replications will eventually&#13;
encourage other farmers in the area to adopt at least part of the improved practices.&#13;
26.   During the first year of the replication program, the Dinas Food Crops Tk. II would provide a&#13;
tool set to selected farmers. Under the guidance of the Dinas staff they would start with the terncing&#13;
(where needed) and bunding of their fields. Once this work has been completed to the agreed&#13;
specifications, the farmers would qualify for a support package similar to that used in the&#13;
demonstrations (para 24), except that no payments would be made for the farmers' own labor. The&#13;
package would include seedlings for the tree crop considered suitable for the area, improved food crop&#13;
seeds, and a minimum supply of fertilizers and agro-chemicals for the tree crop seedlings and food&#13;
crops. High yielding varieties food crop seeds would be procured from government seed farms or&#13;
contract growers. Seedlings for the tree crops would be raised in Dinas Estate Crops Tk. II operated&#13;
nurseries in each of the targeted kabupaten. During the second year the Dinas Estate Crops Tk. II&#13;
would provide tree crop seedlings needed for filling-in the initial plantation and the frntlizer and&#13;
chemicals needed for the new seedlings. Except for guidance by the extension stafl no further support&#13;
for food crop cultivation would be given to the farmers after the initial year. However, farmers would&#13;
be encouraged to organize themselves into farmer associations and to establish revolving funds for the&#13;
purchase of seasonal cash inputs from cooperatives or private traders.&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
27.   The selected drylandfarin model includes cashew as the tree crop of choice since cashew is:&#13;
(a) expected to be suitable to many of the areas, (b) popular among the farmers, and (c) representative&#13;
for the costs and benefits of other tree crops. Cocoa and coffee (arabica and robusta) are viable&#13;
alternatives in some of the target areas. With regard to the food crop model, only moderate fertilizer&#13;
applications and use of hybrid maize seeds have been assumed in the "with project 2" case and no&#13;
fertilizer with local maize seeds in the "with project 1" model. It is quite probable, as observed under&#13;
NTASP, that farmers will initially adopt the second model but eventually revert to the first model after&#13;
the free distribution of inputs has ended.&#13;
28.   Table 1 shows the project's estimated incrementalproduciion, under the assumption that 50&#13;
percent of the participating farmers would stay with model 2 and the remainder revert to model 1.&#13;
Farm budgets for the dryland models are in Table 3.&#13;

C. House Plot Development&#13;
Background&#13;
29.   Almost all rural households have house plots of 0.1 to 0.2 ha. However, the productivity of&#13;
these house plots tends to be low. There is significant potential to intensify the production of fruits,&#13;
vegetables, fuel wood, and forage crops in these areas.&#13;
Proposed Developments&#13;
30.   Home garden cultivation would be improved under the project in order to improve family&#13;
nutrition and raise incomes. Intensification of cultivation would be canied out through training of&#13;
community leaders and demonstrations. Project assistance would be provided in the form of extension&#13;
advice, seedlings, seeds, inputs, and smrall tools. Emphasis would be given to the cultivation of fruit&#13;
trees.&#13;
31.   The Dinas Food Crops Tk. II would implement this activity. The extension workers would&#13;
cooperate closely with the PKK in each location. The following activities would be undertaken: (a)&#13;
design of location specific technology packages in consultation with the villagers, especially the&#13;
women; (b) training of community leaders (in particular PKK) in upgrading of home plots and&#13;
sanitation; (c) provision of inputs for demonstrations; and (d) assistance for villagers who also wish to&#13;
upgrade their house plots.&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
32.   It is expected that 2,800 households would participate in the demonstrations and directly&#13;
benefit. Estimates of incremental production are in Table 1 and a typical budget in Table 4.&#13;

D. Livestock Development&#13;
Background&#13;
33.   As of 1993 there were about 400,000 head of cattle and 200,000 buffaloes in Nusa Tenggara&#13;
Barat and about 750,000 cattle and 175,000 buffaloes in Nusa Tenggara Tinmr. Of these about one&#13;
third are in the proposed project areas. The existing herds are managed extensively, calving rates are&#13;
low and use of improved forages still is limited. The buffaloes are generally used for draft in the&#13;
sawahs. Some of the cattle also are used for draft but most are kept for savings and eventally sold for&#13;
slaughter. The island of Timor has nearly 90 percent of all cattle in NTT.&#13;
34.   Cattle was introduced in Timor only in 1912. Since then the cattle population has been&#13;
increasing rapidly - reportedly by more than 50 percent in Timor over the last 25 years. Cattle are the&#13;
only significant export from NTT. Annual numbers exported increased from about 20,000 head in&#13;
1978 to about 70,000 head in 1994, but numbers and also the weights are highly dependent on climatic&#13;
and other conditions. Cattle are largey raised in uncontrolled, open-range, communal grazing systems&#13;
on natuml pastures. The pastures are often overgrazed, especially near vilages and watering points,&#13;
and frequent fires during the dry season often exacerbate the situation. However, increasingly livestock&#13;
are tethered or kept in barns and fed larntoro (Leucaena) through the cut-and-cany feeding system.&#13;
Almost all farmers in the project areas want to own cattle, but not many have enough fiuds to buy&#13;
breeding stock. The predecessor NTASP supported the farmers with the acquisition of breeding&#13;
stock.&#13;
The NTASP Experience&#13;
35.   Some 20,750 head of cattle were distriluted by NTASP (92 percent of target) under the&#13;
guidance of 41 livestock field extension teams (SATGAS) established under the project. The project&#13;
was successful in most of its development activities, except for cattle fattening as only 500 head of&#13;
cattle were distributed out of 6,000 envisaged at appraisal. Cattle distribution, using the in-kind&#13;
revolving credit system, and the establishment of SATGAS field teams, were successfully initiated&#13;
during previous Bank and EFAD financed cattle development projects in Sumatra and Sulawesi. The&#13;
earlier projects showed the importance of careful selection of beneficiary households: unless the new&#13;
cattle keepers provide for the necessary fodder and take proper care of the animals, they won't be able&#13;
to repay their debts on time.&#13;
36.   In accordance with national policy, recipients of breeding stock have to return two off-spring&#13;
within six years to the Dinas Livestock. As of mid-1994 NTASP project staffhad redistributed 2,450&#13;
and sold 3,700 of the off-springs collected as repayment. The demand from smallholders for cattle&#13;
remains strong. In NTT the large majority of farmers want to keep cattle for saving. In NTB most&#13;
farmers want cattle for land preparation, for the manure they produce, or for other agricultural&#13;
purposes. One of the key conditions for receiving cattle is that farmers do not yet own any cattle. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 11 of 19&#13;
eligibility condition has provided a major challenge to livestock extension staff as they had to impart&#13;
over a short period basic husbandry skills upon the farmers. The mixed results are reflected in two key&#13;
coefficients: calving rates under NTASP were 52 percent compared to the 78 percent target, and calf&#13;
mortality rates were 9.5 percent compared to the 5 percent target. More focused attention should be&#13;
paid to animal production issues, such as improved nutrition (especially during the dry season), better&#13;
bull managernent, and more effective disease management.&#13;
Proposed Developments&#13;
37.   The project would provide support for distribution of breeding cattle and water buffaloes,&#13;
promotion of intensive management systems, and establishment of community-based revolving systems&#13;
for redistribution of cattle and buffaloes in support of future farming systems development activities. A&#13;
key lesson of the NTASP experience is the need to link conservation farming practices and livestock&#13;
distribution into one farnning system. An increase in the livestock numbers, clearly desired by the&#13;
majority of the farmers, would need to be accompanied by an increase in the feed base in order to avoid&#13;
greater dry season stress and mortality. The most common forms of conservation farming techniques,&#13;
producing high protein animal feed year round, are alley cropping, contour ridge terraces, cover crops,&#13;
lving fences, and bench terraces.&#13;
38.   Distribution of cattle and buffaloes under the proposed project would be restricted to farmers&#13;
who:&#13;
(a)    have successfully participated in project activities for improvement of village irrigation&#13;
systems or dryland farming system development but who do not yet own cattle or&#13;
buffaloes;&#13;
(b)    are members of a farmers group and have successfully participated in training sessions&#13;
on animal husbandry management systems;&#13;
(c)    have built an animal shed and established at least 250 meters of forage trees and grasses&#13;
in hedge rows; and&#13;
(d)    have farm incomes below the district average.&#13;
39.   The cattle and buffalo distribution component would be inplemented under the responsibility&#13;
of the Dinas Livestock Tk. I of the two provinces. At the local levels (kabupaten and kecamatan) the&#13;
Dinas Livestock Tk. II would organize working groups for livestock distribution. In addition to local&#13;
livestock extension and animal health services staff, LCOs operating in the project areas would be&#13;
represented on the working groups. Under the supervision of the Dinas Tk. II the working groups&#13;
would be responsible for: (a) final selection and training of farmer groups to receive cattle; (b)&#13;
distribution of cattle to farmer groups; (c) monitoring of the health of the cattle distributed; (d)&#13;
provision of livestock and forage extension services and veterinary services; (e) maintenance of records&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 12 of 19&#13;
on the performance (calving rates and deaths); and (f) supervision of the redistribution of cattle. In the&#13;
course of the project an assessment would be made of the practicality of tuning over responsibility for&#13;
adninistering the livestock program to the community after the initial distribution has been made.&#13;
40.   Some 7,780 cattle (females) and 600 water buffaloes would be distributed in NTB, and about&#13;
7,020 cattle and 400 water buffaloes in NTT. In addition, bulls would be distributed (for cattle only) at&#13;
the ratio of one bull for every ten heifers. The animals would be procured by the Dinas Livestock Tk. I&#13;
from areas within each province, as close as possible to the distribution areas. For Lombok, Sumba&#13;
and Timor the animals would be procured within each island; for Sumbawa and Flores the aninals&#13;
would come from Lombok and Timor, respectively.&#13;
41.   The distribution of animals would start during the second project year, which would allow&#13;
sufficient time for selection and training of the beneficiaries and the planting of fodder trees and grass.&#13;
The project would establish a revolving system to redistribute cattle to disadvantaged area farmers.&#13;
Each recipient would be allowed to keep the first off-spring but would have to return the second and&#13;
third off-springs. Farmers receiving a bull in addition to a heifer would return three calves. Priority for&#13;
receiving redistnibuted aimals would be given to other low income farmers among the participating&#13;
farmer groups. Future redistribution would be used to support future fanming systems development&#13;
effbrts in the targeted kecamatans.&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
42.   Cattle and bufidlo distnbution would provide a source of direct income to the participants&#13;
through the sale of off-spring, as well as through their use for draft and transport purposes and the&#13;
production of manure. Fodder production would be an integral part of the conservation fanning&#13;
system promoted under the project. The herd projections and the annual animal sales quantities and&#13;
values, without and with the project, are in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.&#13;

E. Vaccination of Chickens Against Newcastle Disease&#13;
Background&#13;
43.   There are some 4.5 million chickens in each of the two provinces, of which just over one&#13;
quarter is in the project areas. A typical rural household has between 5 and 15 birds. There are only a&#13;
few commercial poultry farms in NTB and NTT. Newcastle disease is a common disease of chickens&#13;
in the target areas and causes death losses of smailholder chickens estimated to average about 25&#13;
percent annually (but may reach as much as 80 percent). Control of the disease is a high priority, but&#13;
access to vaccines and local knowledge of their use is limited.&#13;
Proposed Developments&#13;
44.   The project would provide support for training of area farmers and women in the techniques of&#13;
vaccination of chickens against Newcastle disease. The Dinas Livestock Tk. II would inmpemet this&#13;
activity through animal health clinics (Poskeswan). The vaccinations would be undertaken by women&#13;
through the PKK (Family Welfare Organization). Training would be provided in two stages: veterinary&#13;
staff would train the PPLs who would then train two women per participating village. The training&#13;
would be repeated during the second year. Two vaccinations per year are needed. Vaccines, syringes&#13;
and other materials would be provided for two years as a grant to each village requesting assistance.&#13;
Thereafter the Poskeswan would continue to supply vaccines and syringes but the villagers would be&#13;
expected to pay for the vaccinations.&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
45.   The vaccination program would be implemented in about 325 villages in the targeted&#13;
kecamatan and benefit an estimated 50,000 households. Losses from Newcastle disease would be&#13;
minimized and a capacity would be established to continue with the vaccination program after the&#13;
project is closed.&#13;

F. Farm Access Roads&#13;
Background&#13;
46.   Poor road access and lack of fresh water are major constraints for the development of much of&#13;
the eastem islands, including the two Nusa Tenggara provinces. Many villages still are not connected&#13;
by all-weather roads to the provincial and kabupaten road network. Also, existing roads often are&#13;
damaged by rain causing transportation breakdowns between villages and markets. Lack of reliable&#13;
sources of water supply imposes big burdens, particularly on the women and children who have to do&#13;
the hauling from distant sources. Unless communities are connected to all-weather roads and safe&#13;
water supply systems, people will keep on missing out on opportunities for a more productive and&#13;
rewarding village life.&#13;
47.   In the face of those needs, the Government has been allocating large proportions of its&#13;
development budgets to the upgrading of public infrastructure. Improvement of transportation alone&#13;
represented nearly 60 percent of regional development expenditures in 1990/91 in NTB and over 40&#13;
percent in NTT. A recent OECF-financed study, entitled "Rural Areas nfastructure Development"&#13;
(March 1994), includes cost estimates for the upgrading of village roads and bridges in the "Desa&#13;
Tertinggal" (IDT) villages.' For those villages the cost of upgrading village roads and bridges was&#13;
estimated at about US$4 million and US$26 million in NTB and NTT, respectively. Observations by&#13;
the Bank's preappraisal mission for the present project during the 1995 rainy season in Kecamatan&#13;
Lunyuk in Kabupaten Sumbawabesar (NTB) suggest that these estimates are rather conservative.&#13;
48.   Following the completion of the study referred to above, OECF has agreed to allocate about&#13;
US$200 million equivalent for the upgrading over two years (1 995/96 and 1996/97) of rural&#13;
infrastructure in over 3,000 villages in 21 provinces, including the two Nusa Tenggara provinces.2&#13;
Villages are being selected in clusters of five of which at least three should be IDT villages. An amount&#13;
of US$65,000 equivalent is made available to each selected village for the construction of roads and&#13;
bridges, water supply and sanitation systems, and jetties. The 1995/96 program for NTB and NTT&#13;
covers 40 villages with a total allocation of about US$2.6 million. The program for 1996/97 is&#13;
expected to be about the same size. In NTT most of the funds available under the OECF financed&#13;
project will be used for the construction of embungs (water storage reservoirs). Existing Government&#13;
procedures will be followed for approval, financing and implementation of the program. A special&#13;
INPRES3 will be allocated to the kabupaten and the works will be executed by contractors.&#13;
Consultants/supervising engineers employed under the OECF financed project will assist the Dinas&#13;
Public Works Tk. II with the preparation of proposals and the design and supervision of the works.&#13;
' About one fifth of the villages in the NTB project areas, and one quarter in NTT, are listed as IDT villages.&#13;

The NTASP Experience&#13;
49.   Under NTASP some 144 km of national and provincial roads in Flores have been improved,&#13;
against 190 km planned originally. The balance portion of the roads program was financed under an&#13;
Asian Development Bank loan. Subsequently, the road sustained serious damage during the 1993&#13;
earthquake. Recent data show that traffic volumes in most sections have increased close to the&#13;
predicted levels. Routine road maintenance in the two NTASP financed integrated area development&#13;
schemes of Lombok Tengah and Lembor appears to be less than adequate. Local governments already&#13;
have taken some action to improve maintenance. However, more resources should be allocated to&#13;
maintain the roads.&#13;
Proposed Devdopments&#13;
50.   Project interventions intended to directly raise agricultural productivity would be supported by&#13;
improvements of physical access, where necessary. The program would cover all eight project&#13;
kabupaten in NTT and the three kabupaten on Sumbawa island in NTB. The three kabupaten of&#13;
Lombok would not be included in the road improvement program because a relatively good road&#13;
network already exists in Lombok. Priority would be given to villages where needs are demonstrated&#13;
to be highest and the villagers are committed to actively contributed to the implementation of the&#13;
works. It is expected that a substantial part of the budget allocation will be used for the design and&#13;
construction of bridges and culverts on existing rural roads and tracks which are critically in need of&#13;
improvement. Farm access roads would be upgraded to compacted aggregate surface roads for use by&#13;
motorcycles, animal drawn carts and four wheel vehicles.&#13;
51.   The Dinas Public Works Tk. II in the targeted kabupaten would design and inpkment the&#13;
road improvement program under force account or by direct contracting for works costing less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent. Approval of proposals would be dependent on a commitment by the local&#13;
governments to assure future maintenance of the works. The local PMD staff would provide&#13;
assistance to engage the local community in field construction activities. Alignments would be made&#13;
on existing foot paths to avoid the need for land acquisition. Construction costs are expected to vary&#13;
depending on the existing condition of the targeted roads and trails.&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
52.   About Rp 12.7 billion (US$5.6 million) would be allocated under the project. The maximum&#13;
allocation for each participating kecamatan (11 in NTB and 19 in NTT) would be about US$250,000&#13;
equivalent. It is estimated that a total of about 525 km of farm access roads would be upgraded under&#13;
the project, or on average about 17.5 km per participating kecamatan. Substantial variations around&#13;
these averages are likely. Some kecamatan and villages may wish to upgrade one or two key access&#13;
roads, while others would give priority to improvement, or new construction, of bridges and culverts.&#13;

G. Local Community Initiatives and Assistance for Local Community Organizations&#13;
Background&#13;
53.   The bottom-up planning system, as specified in Ministry of Home Affairs Regulation Number 9&#13;
of 1982, provides for the preparation of proposals for development activities from the village level with&#13;
screening at the higher levels. The system has the potential to improve planning of project activities in&#13;
order to respond more directly to the needs of the local people. The main constraints of this planning&#13;
system are: (a) insufficient capacity at the village and kecamatan level to prepare proposals which are in&#13;
line with the felt needs of the rural groups; and (b) insufficient discretionary funding at the kabupaten&#13;
level to respond to these proposals.&#13;
The NTASP Experience&#13;
54.   The NTASP comprised an experimental component for provincially implemented development&#13;
activities. The purpose of the experiment was to test the hypothesis that local governments could&#13;
effectively plan and execute agricultural and integrated area development activities in accordance with&#13;
the needs of the local people. Two approaches were followed:&#13;
(a)   the Agricultural Support Services approach which sought to:&#13;
(i)   strengthen the capacity of local government agencies within the agricultural&#13;
sector (i.e. Dinas Livestock, Food Crops, Estate Crops and Fisheries); and&#13;
(ii)   support a range of field activities in 46 kecamatan to directly increase the&#13;
productivity of low-income farmers (a ceiling of Rp 200 million per year was&#13;
given to each of the nine targeted kabupaten in NTB and NTT to supplement&#13;
development funding available for the agricultural sector); and&#13;
(b)   the Integrated Area Development (IAD) approach which involved some ten sector&#13;
agencies in two targeted areas in Lombok (dryland) and one in Flores (irrigated&#13;
settlement scheme).&#13;
55.   Coordination of annual planning and implementation has been carried out by the BAPPEDAs&#13;
Tk. I and Tk. II. The project structure paralleled the existing structure of local government with&#13;
project management units being established within the BAPPEDAs at the provincial and kabupaten&#13;
levels. Actions supported under this component included land conservation (with disappointing&#13;
results), seed multiplication (promising), village irrigation (excellent), tree crops (disappointing), and&#13;
livestock support (good). The results of the IAD activities in Lombok and Flores were generally&#13;

ICR for NTASP4 observed that the overall development impact and sustainability of this component&#13;
would have been enhanced if program development had applied more rigorous criteria to define&#13;
priority rankings for interventions.&#13;
Proposed Developments&#13;
56.   Approach and Scope. The proposed project would support local community initiatives which&#13;
are expected to result in direct benefits to the communities. Local leaders would be trained in&#13;
community-based planning methods. The project would provide discretionary funding to support&#13;
implementation of initiatives which are considered to be a high priority by the local community and are&#13;
technically and economically feasible. During project years 2 through 6 supplemental funding of Rp 50&#13;
million (about US$22,250) per kecamatan would be provided to support high priority initiatives. Local&#13;
communication organizations (LCOs) in the target areas would be encouraged to participate in the&#13;
preparation of proposals for high priority agriculture-based area development initiatives. The&#13;
kabupaten office of PMD (BANGDES) would take the lead role at the local level in coordinating the&#13;
formulation of requests for assistance through the bottom-up planning system. Extension workers and&#13;
LCO staff in each area would act as facilitators in assisting local communities to identify priorities and&#13;
formulate realistic proposals. Implementation of development initiatives would be in cooperation with&#13;
the Dinas Tk. II with the technical capacity to best provide support for each activity.&#13;
57.   Generally it is expected that a range of initiatives would be proposed in line with local&#13;
conditions and community preferences. Priority would be given to proposals for initiatives to promote&#13;
farmiing systems development which might include, but would not be limited to: revolving credit&#13;
systems for cattle, water buffaloes, goats and pigs; introduction of new agricultural technology; post-&#13;
harvest processing and storage for food and estate crops; initiatives to control wild pigs; home&#13;
industries; and community managed infrastructure development activities (mostly water supply and&#13;
roads). Guidelines for selection of initiatives for funding would be established so as not to delete the&#13;
intent of eliciting priorities as identified by the community. A guide in Bahasa Indonesia would be&#13;
prepared as part of the training program for Community Development Facilitators. The proposals&#13;
would be reviewed and prioritized at the kabupaten level. Technical agencies (or where necessary&#13;
consultants) would assist with the implementation of initiatives where technical challenges are beyond&#13;
local capabilities.&#13;
58.   To be selected for support by the project the proposed initiatives should meet the following&#13;
criteria:&#13;
(a)   technically feasible and economically justified productive activities;&#13;
(b)   maximum amount per initiative: Rp 10 million;&#13;

(c)   maximum amount per beneficiary: Rp 250,000;&#13;
(d)   minimum number of beneficiaries per initiative: 10; and&#13;
(e)   beneficiaries should contribute locally available materials, unskilled labor and land&#13;
where required.&#13;
59.   Preference would be given to proposals which:&#13;
(a)   benefit the poorest segment of the community;&#13;
(b)   involve women and youth groups;&#13;
(c)   are assisted by LCOs;&#13;
(d)   have the lowest risk of failure; and&#13;
(e)   have the greatest socio-economic impact.&#13;
60.   Expected Results. The selected initiatives would measurably increase the incomes and&#13;
levels of welfare among the low income groups in the target areas. It is expected that some&#13;
25,000 rural households would benefit from this activity.&#13;
Assistance for Local Community Organizations&#13;
61.   Background. Large numbers of LCOs are active in NTB and NTT. Usually, the LCOs&#13;
are organized by the community and religious leaders based at the kabupaten and kecamatan&#13;
levels and with memberships at the local level. The experience under NTASP and other projects&#13;
has shown that local LCOs have the potential to increase the participation of the community in the&#13;
development activities. There is significant potential to expand local government cooperation&#13;
with local LCOs to develop income generating activities for poverty groups in the rural areas.&#13;
62.   Scope and Approach. The proposed project would support local LCOs in developing&#13;
community-based initiatives in the targeted kecamatan. The amount of support would be Rp 35&#13;
million (about US$15,500) per year for each of the 14 targeted kabupaten during project years 2&#13;
through 6. The executing agency for this activity would be the office of PMD in each of the&#13;
targeted kabupaten. Local LCOs in each kabupaten would be requested to prepare proposals for&#13;
community-based activities in the targeted kecamatan..&#13;

' Calculation is for Year 10 Scenario.&#13;
" Basic assumptions: 25 cashew trees per farm, covering about 0.1 ha, and producing approximately 7.5 kg raw nuts per tree annually 10 years after planting.&#13;
" It is assumed that 'With Project 2' scenario, the maize yield will be higher due to the use of hybrid and other high yielding maize seeds.&#13;

PROJECT SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
The mix of specialties and frequency and duration of missions likely to be needed&#13;
to ensure adequate project supervision is listed below. In addition, the Bank's Resident&#13;
Mission would conduct ex-post reviews of works completed and goods supplied at the&#13;
rate of about two staff-weeks per year. The fall supervision missions would concentrate&#13;
on the review of the proposed work programs and budgets for the following years. The&#13;
spring missions would focus on the results achieved in the field during the preceding rainy&#13;
season. The mid-term review mission, tentatively scheduled for September 1998, would&#13;
focus on project impact and institutional development.&#13;

NUSA TENGGARA AGRICULTURAL AREA&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Input Supply and Marketing System:&#13;
Institutional and Policy Aspects&#13;
Farm Inputs&#13;
1.    Seeds. The supply of sufficient quantities of good quality seeds for rice and other food&#13;
crops has been a problem during the implementation of NTASP. Some relief was provided&#13;
through the rehabilitation and upgrading of a number of provincial seed farms. There were some&#13;
improvements in the availability of quality seeds, particularly for paddy, in the immediate vicinity&#13;
of the project-improved seed farms . The proposed project would support the production of&#13;
quality seeds by the Dinas seed farms through civil works and supply of equipment, as needed.&#13;
2.    Tree Crop Seedlings. In the two Nusa Tenggara provinces there are no private growers&#13;
of seedlings for commercial trees, such as coconut, cocoa, coffee and cashew, and fruit trees.&#13;
Professor Yujiro Hayamil observed that private nurseries have not sufficiently developed in&#13;
Indonesia to meet farmers' demands because of market failures (moral hazard). Public-supported&#13;
nurseries are therefore called for to cure this market failure. Accordingly, the Dinas Estate Crops&#13;
Tk. II raise seedlings in their own nurseries or, in case of strong demand, they may let contracts&#13;
with private growers.&#13;
3.    Fertilizers and Pesticides. Government-owned enterprises control the wholesale of&#13;
fertilizers and other agro-chemicals, while cooperatives and private traders are the retailers.&#13;
These arrangements appear to work reasonably.2 It is expected that the increased demand for&#13;
fertilizers due to the diffusion of improved technology will be met by the existing retail system.&#13;
1 In Search of Modem Sustainable Agriculture: A View from Upland Indonesia, Yujiro Hayamni, 1995.&#13;
2 The Bank has in recent years declined to finance the cost of fertilizers due to Government procurement&#13;
restrictions.&#13;

Fann Outputs&#13;
4.    Food Crops. All food crops produced in the Nusa Tenggara provinces are consumed by&#13;
the farmers and their families, or sold locally. Other than local government levies that may be&#13;
imposed on local sales (see para. 8), there are no restrictions on the trade in food crops.&#13;
5.    Tree Crops. The available evidence indicates the existence of competitive markets and&#13;
prices. A recent case study for one kabupaten in NTT reported on the failure of an attempt by&#13;
four traders to control the market for tree crop products through a cartel arrangement, and the&#13;
resulting increase in farmgate prices. In the same kabupaten the local government tried to set&#13;
minimum commodity prices with the apparent intention to protect farmers from exploitation.&#13;
However, there are no effective means of enforcement and it is therefore unlikely that such&#13;
attempts have a significant impact on the market.&#13;
6.    Livestock. The main issue in the livestock subsector concerns the central Govermnent's&#13;
determination to control the inter-island trade of both slaughter animals and breeding cattle. For&#13;
the cattle producing islands, quota are being established annually for the export of slaughter&#13;
animals to the importing islands (mostly Java). Furthermore, local officials occasionally impose&#13;
additional restrictions on trade. Such restrictions have the potential to limit the volume of sales,&#13;
and thereby to suppress the farmgate price, while on the other hand raising the meat price for the&#13;
consumers in other provinces. However, the indications are that inspite of these distortions, cattle&#13;
raising is financially profitable, given the interest and extent of the business in NTT (750,000&#13;
heads of cattle being raised and over 50,000 exported for slaughter). A cattle marketing study&#13;
would be carried out during the first project year in order to review the impact of existing&#13;
restrictions on farmers' incomes and recommend changes where appropriate. The study would be&#13;
followed by the preparation of an action plan taking into account the recommendations of the&#13;
study and the Bank's comments..&#13;
Other Issues&#13;
7.    Trading Restrictions. There is some anecdotal information from one kabupaten in NTT&#13;
where local authorities are reported to have attempted limiting marketing of agricultural surpluses&#13;
through cooperatives only. Such measures are difficult to enforce and therefore do not&#13;
significantly affect the market.&#13;
8.    Fees and Levies. Local governments routinely impose fees and levies on the trade and/or&#13;
transport of primary commodities. There are considerable differences in the levels of the fees and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
levies among the different local governments. However, generally the fees/levies represent only a&#13;
small proportion of the price of the commodities and do not normally act as a significant deterrent&#13;
for production (much like a sales tax in the West). For example, in Kabupaten Ende (NTT), the&#13;
levies on paddy and maize vary between 4 and 5 percent of the average farmgate price and that&#13;
for cashew nuts about 9 percent.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Nusa Tenggara
            Agricultural Area Development Project are to raise
            smallholder incomes, strengthen local level institutions,
            and foster broad-based participation at the grassroots
            level. There are three main components to the program: (1)
            the establishment of the Naibonat Assessment Institute for
            Agricultural Technology (NAIAT) to carry out resource-based,
            farmer-participatory, location-specific, adaptive research
            and technology transfer with emphasis on decentralized
            planning, management, and decision making; (2)
            agriculture-based area development involving
            intensifications of agricultural production systems in
            village irrigation schemes, a pilot scheme promoting
            improved dryland crop/animal farm system technology,
            livestock distribution on credit, forage crop development,
            poultry vaccination, house plot cropping intensification,
            farm access roads, and local community initiatives; and (3)
            strengthening agricultural support services and project
            administration at the provincial, district, and sub-district
            levels through rehabilitation and improvement of
            agricultural support services facilities, staff training,
            workshops and seminars, and technical assistance.
