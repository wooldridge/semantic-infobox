1.	 Introduction to Water Quality and&#13;
    Public Health&#13;
Drinking water is a precious and scarce                                  â&#128;¢	 Improperly stored and stagnant water leading&#13;
resource that needs to be protected, kept free                              to breeding of mosquitoes that can cause&#13;
from contamination, and used carefully without                              malaria, dengue, and so on.&#13;
wasting. Safe drinking water is key to ensuring&#13;
improved public health. In Sikkim, in the period&#13;
                                                                         The health costs of water borne diseases are&#13;
2002-07, as many as 2,77,000 persons were&#13;
                                                                         very high (such as costs of medical treatment,&#13;
infected with water borne diseases such as&#13;
                                                                         loss of income due to absence from work, and&#13;

25 people lost their lives.1 The number of actual&#13;
                                                                         consumed is safe to begin with.&#13;

each day about 1,000 children under the age                              Studies indicate that improved water quality&#13;
of five die from diarrhea,2 and in developing                            alone results in 15-17 percent reduction in&#13;
countries worldwide about 1.5 million children die                       diarrheal cases. Water sometimes appears to&#13;
each year from diarrhea.                                                 be colorless, tasteless and odorless. However,&#13;
                                                                         it may still contain chemicals and germs that&#13;

    a Village Water Safety Plan&#13;
The preparation of Village Water Safety Plans                Water Safety Plan, operationalizing the Water&#13;
can be discussed in terms of â&#128;&#152;Six Stepsâ&#128;&#153;. The                Safety Plan, and preparing a proposal to&#13;
six steps are: assembling the team, community                submit to the district authorities for financing&#13;
mapping, walking the system, preparing the                   (Figure 2).&#13;

The preparation of Water Safety Plans therefore&#13;
requires the participation of                         Outputs&#13;
various stakeholders:&#13;
                                                      1.	 A team of stakeholders who will&#13;

STEP 2: Community mapping&#13;
&#13;
Why do we do it?                                       location, and type and condition of water&#13;
                                                       source[s] and system[s];&#13;
Community mapping is useful to get everyone         â&#128;¢	 Identify which households are served by the&#13;
involved in expressing their demands for               different sources and systems; and&#13;
improvements, sharing their knowledge of            â&#128;¢	 Ask the community to map the locations of&#13;
the water system, and commitment to seeing             water sources and systems, and households&#13;
changes made.                                          in their ward (this should be done on the&#13;

How do we do it?&#13;
                                                    Outputs&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Gather the community and inform people&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This report covers water safety planning
            for Sikkim, India&#146;s rural drinking water system. It consists
            of two volumes. Volume I is a Training Manual. It begins
            with an introduction to water quality and public health.
            Section 2 covers the status of rural drinking water in
            Sikkim. Section 3 describes how to prepare a village water
            safety plan. It ends with several tables and figures. Volume
            II consists of six planning templates for the water safety
            plan: Technical and Financial Survey for Spring Source
            Gravity Flow Schemes; Water Source Plan; Water Safety Plan;
            Operating Plan; Service Improvement Plan; and Performance Indicators.
