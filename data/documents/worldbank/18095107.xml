Notes: (i) All amounts and delivery dates listed in the draft Financing Strategy are indicative and will depend on capacity in line ministries as well as donor contributions; (ii)&#13;
Marked blue cells indicate priority scale up areas identified by the Ministry of Finance; (iii) * A $300 million allocation is includedfor NSP of which $250 million was deloyedfrom&#13;
1391 to 1392 due to an outstanding audit. These funds have now been transferred; (iv) *An additional $50 million is being allocated to rural roads subject to its ability to commit.&#13;
Should NSP run out offunds in FY139Z the unallocated/undisbursed funds from rural roads will go to NSP, (v) SY1393 totals are heavily dependent on a number of very large&#13;
infrastructure projects whichcould slide into SY1394; and (vi) An administration fee qf2 % is charged at the time donor contributions are received by the Bank and released into&#13;
the Bank's budget only based on project disbursement.&#13;
