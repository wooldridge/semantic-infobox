            Dear Sir:&#13;
&#13;
            1.      We are pleased to acknowledge on behalf of the International Bank for&#13;

            grant a sum not exceeding fifty eight million Norwegian Kroner (NOK 58,000,000)&#13;
            (the "Contribution") for the Partnership for Infrastructure Development in the West Bank&#13;
            and Gaza Multi Donor Trust Fund (the "Trust Fund") in accordance with the terms of this&#13;
            Agreement. Other donors are also expected to contribute to the Trust Fund on the terms&#13;
            and conditions specified in the Annexes to this Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
            2.     The Contribution shall be used to finance the activities and the categories of&#13;
            expenditures in accordance with the terms set forth in the "Description of Activities,&#13;
            Expenditures and Governance Arrangements for the Partnership for Infrastructure&#13;
            Development in the West Bank &amp; Gaza Multi Donor Trust Fund" attached hereto as&#13;
            Annex 1, and shall be administered by the Bank on behalf of the Donor in accordance&#13;
            with the terms of this Agreement including the "Standard Provisions Applicable to the&#13;
            Partnership for Infrastructure Development in the West Bank &amp; Gaza Multi Donor Trust&#13;
            Fund" (the "Standard Provisions") attached hereto as Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
            3.      The Donor shall deposit the Contribution into such bank account designated by&#13;

&#13;
        This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements entered into&#13;
between the Bank and the Donors that provide Contributions to be administered by the Bank for&#13;
the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
1.      Administration of the Contributions&#13;
&#13;
1.1.     The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth&#13;
in this Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary&#13;
or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the IBRD and IDA under their Articles of&#13;
Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
&#13;
1.2.    The Contribution shall be administered in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies&#13;
and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank&#13;
resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the&#13;
relevant decisions of the Security Council, taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the&#13;
United Nations. The Donor acknowledges that this provision does not create any obligations of&#13;
the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive&#13;
orders of an individual member country that may apply to the Donor, nor shall it be deemed a&#13;
waiver, expressed or implied, of any of the privileges and immunities of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Comminaliny, Exchange and Investment of the Contributions&#13;
&#13;
2.1.    The Contributions shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept separate&#13;

fund assets maintained by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
2.2.      The Contributions may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as may&#13;
facilitate their disbursement.&#13;
&#13;
2.3.    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the Contributions pending their disbursement in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds&#13;
administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust&#13;
Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Administrative Cost Recovery&#13;
&#13;
3.1.    In order to assist in the defrayment of the costs of administration and other expenses&#13;
incurred by the Bank under this Agreement, the Bank may deduct and retain for its own account&#13;
an amount equal to two percent (2%) of each Contribution. In addition, costs for program&#13;
management as defined in Annex I up to a maximum of three percent (3%) of each Contribution&#13;
will be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis. If the contributions increase beyond what&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                -8-                                     TFO71898&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was originally expected at the time of counter-signature of the first administration agreement, and&#13;
the administrative costs increase as a result, the Donors acknowledge that an additional&#13;
administrative fee may be applied to such new contributions.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Grants to Recipient&#13;
&#13;
4.1.     The Bank shall, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of the Donors, enter into&#13;

Annex I consistent with the purposes of this Agreement and on the terms and conditions set forth&#13;
in the Grant Agreements. Grant Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount of&#13;
the Contributions that all Donors have agreed to make available under the Administration&#13;
Agreements between the Bank and the Donors. Upon request by a Donor, the Bank shall furnish a&#13;
copy of the Grant Agreements to the Donors.&#13;
&#13;
4.2.    The Bank shall be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under the&#13;
Grant Agreements. Subject to the consent of the Recipient, representatives of the Donors may be&#13;
invited by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
4.3.    The Bank shall promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the terms&#13;
of any Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under&#13;
any Grant Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank shall afford the Donors the&#13;
opportunity to exchange views before effecting any such modification or exercising any such&#13;
remedy.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Procurement&#13;
&#13;
5.1.    For Recipient-executed activities, the Grant Agreements shall provide that the&#13;
Contributions shall be used by the Recipient to finance expenditures for goods and services, as&#13;
the case may be, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on "Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits" and the Bank's Guidelines on the "Selection and Employment of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers," as in effect at the date of entry into the respective Grant Agreements.&#13;
&#13;
