Project Description&#13;
1.    For every population cohort in Senegal, infectious diseases are the main cause of&#13;
mortality and morbidity, with malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhea being most prevalent.&#13;
In recent years, there has been a recrudescence of epidemic diseases such as cholera, a steady&#13;
increase of endemic diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis and hepatitis B,&#13;
and the emergence of new viral diseases such as AIDS.&#13;
2.    The organization of endemic and epidemic diseases surveillance and control is the&#13;
responsibility of the Endemic Disease Control sub-DirectorateService National des Grandes&#13;
Endemies (SNGE). Over the past 20 years, the resources allocated to the SNGE have steadily&#13;
decreased to 1 percent of the Ministerial budget. Surveillance and control activities have been&#13;
mainly supported by the donor community, with a project-by-project and donor-by-donor&#13;
approach. The capability and organization of the SNGE as a team have progressively&#13;
deteriorated, undermining the effectiveness and motivation of its staff. Furthermore, knowledge&#13;
of the epidemiological situation in the country has decreased in the absence of an effective and&#13;
communicative health management information system, leaving no opportunity for prevention or&#13;
proactive measures.&#13;
3.    The project was born from the dialogue between Government and IDA about the New&#13;
Orientations of the Health and Social Sector Policy (Nouvelles Orientations de la Politique de&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Sante et d'Action Sociale) defined in June 1995, and was developed during a series of&#13;
consultative meetings organized by the Government over an 18-month period. Participants in&#13;
these meetings were drawn from all stakeholder groups, including district and regional medical&#13;
staff, from the medical university, and partners in development for Senegal.&#13;
4.     The long-term objective of the project is to strengthen national capacity to control&#13;
endemic and epidemic diseases, with greater concern for rationalization in the use of resources&#13;
and cost-effectiveness in the choice of control stategy. Project strategy consists in institutionally&#13;
strengthening the SNGE, supporting its efforts to control, in particular, three diseases of public&#13;
health importance, i.e. malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis, and implementing a&#13;
computerized health management information system. The project design includes three main&#13;
components: (a) support to malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis control activities, (b)&#13;
development of a computerized health management information system; and (c) institutional&#13;
strengthening of the SNGE.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
5.     By reducing the burden of malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis, the project will&#13;
directly benefit the populations in rural areas where these diseases are most prevalent. As a&#13;
result of the reinforcement of national capacities to control endemic and epidemic diseases, the&#13;
project will also significantly benefit people in poor urban areas who have been severely hit by&#13;
recent epidemics of cholera, and who are still at high risk from other epidemics such as cerebral&#13;
meningitis. The social and economic development of the Senegalese population will strongly&#13;
benefit from the success of the project as endemic disease control activities are pure public&#13;
goods with important externalities. For example, the project's global objective to reduce malaria&#13;
morbidity by 20 percent would save an equivalent of 0.2 percent of GDP. Finally, the&#13;
implementation of a computerized network supporting the national health information system&#13;
will allow a better planification of resources, a improved communication between staff, and also&#13;
with international partners, as well as a new work culture towards partnership and cross-&#13;
fertilization.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
6.     The first risk relates to the acceptance by health staff of the new mission for the SNGE&#13;
and its integration within the general health services. This risk would be reduced by: (a) a clear&#13;
definition of the breakdown of the SNGE's responsibilities in the control of each disease; (b) the&#13;
SNGE's demonstration of high professionalism and expertise; and (c) the development of a&#13;
strong team spirit. The second risk relates to the non-sustainability of crucial activities at&#13;
peripheral levels, such as continuous in-service training, regular supervision of the staff, and&#13;
education of the population on public health issues. These activities will be included and&#13;
budgeted for within the Regional and District Health and Social Plans, and regional and district&#13;
health teams would be accountable for implementing these activities. The last risk would be the&#13;
failure of the donor community to fully coordinate its efforts to support the surveillance and&#13;
control of endemic and epidemic diseases. The Bank would assist the Government in&#13;
minimizing this potential risk during project implementation through coordination mechanisms&#13;
to be established under both this project and the Health Sector Investment Project under&#13;
preparation.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL&#13;
ENDEMIC DISEASE CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The Government of Senegal has requested International Development Aid (IDA)&#13;
financing over 5 years for a credit to develop its national capacity for epidemiological&#13;
surveillance and control of endemic and epidemic diseases. Total project costs are estimated at&#13;
US$17.0 million. The Government would contribute about US$0.9 million. The remaining&#13;
US$16.1 million would be financed by the International Development Agency (IDA), European&#13;
Union (EU), French Cooperation (FAC), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World&#13;
Health Organization (WHO).&#13;
1.2   The project would be IDA's first free-standing endemic disease control project in&#13;
Senegal and the first project of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa. It is an intervention which&#13;
focuses on the revitalization of the Service National des Grandes Endemies (SNGE), on the&#13;
development of a computerized network-based health management information system (SIG),&#13;
and on the reinforcement of the control of malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis, three&#13;
diseases which impede the productivity of the human capital base. The project would precede&#13;
and complement the Senegalese Health Sector Investment Project (SIP) which is under&#13;
preparation and will be appraised in FY97. The early implementation of the project will give a&#13;
headstart to the development of the SIG, thus facilitating the SIP implementation.&#13;
1.3   The project would be IDA's third contribution to the development of health services in&#13;
Senegal. The first two projects did not include any significant investment in the control of&#13;
endemic diseases. Policy measures and investments included in this project have been&#13;
developed through extensive dialogue with Senegalese authorities based on a ten-year National&#13;
Health and Social Development Plan and a five-year investment program, both completed in&#13;
March 1997 with the support of multilateral and bilateral donors.&#13;
1.4   The following partners of the Senegal Government who are involved in the health sector,&#13;
the EU, FAC, UNICEF and WHO, have participated actively in project preparation and would&#13;
cofinance the project. Given the importance they attach to the achievement of the project&#13;
objectives, they would adjust the agendas of their bilateral programs in order to maximize the&#13;
synergy with the project, in particular in the domain of the development of the SIG.&#13;
2. THE CONTEXT&#13;
A. DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT&#13;
2.1    Geography and Climate. Senegal is a medium-sized country (196,722 km 2) with 550&#13;
km of Atlantic coastline. It is located at the westernmost point of the African Continent.&#13;
Senegal is generally flat and lies in the Senegal-Mauritanian Depression. Three-fourths of the&#13;
country lies in the Sahel, which has suffered from a lower-than-normal average rainfall for the&#13;
last 40 years. The country itself has a tropical sub-desert climate. The rainy season is limited to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
a seasonal monsoon, wetter in the south (more than 1000 mm from May to October) than in the&#13;
north (greater than 300 mm from June to September). The duration, intensity, and seasonal&#13;
distribution of the rains at any location varies considerably from year to year, particularly in&#13;
areas of lowest rainfall.&#13;
2.2    Population and Economy. Senegal population is estimated around 8.5 million&#13;
inhabitants. Half is under the age of 16, and the majority (58 percent) lives in rural areas.&#13;
Senegal has a per capita income of US$621 (1996). One-third of the population lives below the&#13;
poverty line, estimated at US$150 in 1992. Population growth rate is substantially above the real&#13;
GDP growth rate (2.5 percent vs. 1.7 percent, 1986-93). This decline in real per capita product&#13;
was due to Senegal's inability to adjust to falling terms of trade for its main exports (groundnuts&#13;
and phosphates). Senegal shares with many Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries a lack of&#13;
export differentiation that makes it particularly vulnerable to changes in the world prices of its&#13;
main exports. The three major exports of Senegal, i.e. phosphates, groundnuts and fish,&#13;
represent 77 percent of total exports.&#13;
2.3    Since Senegal belongs to the African Financial Community (CFA) franc zone,&#13;
adjustment of the nominal exchange rate was, until the end of 1993, out of reach because it&#13;
requires unanimous agreement by all CFA zone members and France. A devaluation of the real&#13;
exchange rate, which is the crucial variable for competitiveness, was prevented by rigid nominal&#13;
wages and by an expansive fiscal policy. The over-evaluation of the exchange rate compounded&#13;
the Senegalese economy's loss of competitiveness, owing to the rigid regulation of labor and&#13;
widespread monopolies in the industry and service sectors.&#13;
2.4    Macroeconomic Performance. Since early 1994, Senegal has been implementing a&#13;
medium-term adjustment and reform strategy aimed at taking full advantage of the gain in&#13;
competitiveness brought about by the devaluation of the CFA franc (January 12, 1997) and&#13;
creating the conditions for strong and sustainable economic growth. This strategy is based on&#13;
fiscal and monetary stability and structural reforms. It aims at liberalizing the economy,&#13;
reducing the size of the public sector, and fostering private sector development.&#13;
2.5    This strategy has resulted in a marked recovery of economic activity and a significant&#13;
improvement in Senegal's macroeconomic performance. Real per capita growth became&#13;
positive in 1995 and it is estimated at 2.4 percent in 1996. Inflation has been lower than&#13;
expected: the CPI fell from 37 percent in 1994 to 5.5 percent in 1995 and is estimated at 3.3&#13;
percent in 1996. Fiscal performance has also improved: revenue rose as a percentage of GDP&#13;
due to strengthened tax administration, but a failure to adjust petroleum prices to increased world&#13;
prices created a shortfall in revenue in 1996. There was no expenditure overrun, while increased&#13;
resources were allocated to basic health and education.&#13;
2.6    Poverty. Although recent indicators of poverty or income distribution are not available,&#13;
the CFA franc devaluation and the resulting shift in internal terms of trade appear to have&#13;
boosted incomes in rural areas by 40 percent. Given that the agricultural sector in Senegal is&#13;
dominated by small landholders, the large increase in the real value of agricultural output&#13;
suggests a substantial improvement in the real living standards of Senegal's rural poor during the&#13;
last three years.&#13;
2.7    Social Indicators. In spite of real improvements over the last decade, health indicators&#13;
show that Senegal's living standards remain below those of other lower-middle income&#13;
countries. Infant and child mortality account for 60 percent of all deaths; life expectancy and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
primary school enrollment are estimated at 50 years and 56 percent respectively as compared to&#13;
the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) averages of 52 years and 70 percent. In education, efforts&#13;
continue toward raising the primary enrollment ratio and improving the quality and efficiency of&#13;
higher education. The primary enrollment ratio declined from 58 percent in 1989 to about 54.3&#13;
percent in 1993, before rising to the current level of 56 percent, with female enrollment growing&#13;
faster than male enrollment. The Government has a goal of universal basic education and&#13;
intends to raise the primary enrollment ratio to 65 percent by 1998.&#13;
2.8   In the health sector, infant mortality declined from 159 (per thousand live births) to 68&#13;
between 1975 and 1992 (Demography Health Survey 2, 1992-93). The Government will&#13;
reinforce its policy to further improve the quality and efficiency of health care delivery at all&#13;
levels. A three-year Public Investment Program - Programme Triennal d 'Investissement&#13;
Public (PTIP) - covering the period 1997-99 will give priority to projects that support human&#13;
resources development and the fight against poverty. Primary health care has been recently&#13;
expanded nationwide with IDA support, and with a better allocation of resources for health&#13;
services provided by district health centers and health posts, the budget share of the hospital&#13;
sector and urban services decreasing in the mean time from 45 percent during the period 1981 -&#13;
1985 to 34 percent during the period 1986 - 1995).&#13;
2.9    The Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Board on February 16, 1995, aims&#13;
to assist Senegal in reducing poverty by restoring growth in per capita income and fostering a&#13;
more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. To relaunch economic growth, the strategy&#13;
focuses on increasing opportunities for private sector expansion and improving productivity in&#13;
agriculture--particularly in the production of the traditional export (groundnuts), food, and non-&#13;
traditional and high value-added crops. To support this growth, the Government should provide&#13;
a more efficient and cost-effective provision of public goods such as power, water and&#13;
transportation, and an improvement in the human capital base. To foster a more equitable&#13;
distribution of benefits, the strategy focuses on improving public resource mobilization and the&#13;
efficiency and cost-effectiveness of public expenditures-particularly in basic education and&#13;
health.&#13;
B. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
2.10   Introduction. For every population cohort in Senegal, infectious diseases are still the&#13;
main cause of mortality and morbidity, with malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhea being&#13;
most prevalent. In the past ten years, there has been a recrudescence of epidemic diseases such&#13;
as cholera, a steady increase of endemic diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis&#13;
and hepatitis B, and the emergence of new viral diseases such as AIDS. Lastly, the threat of the&#13;
development of deadly epidemics such as the cerebral meningitis outbreak, which affected more&#13;
than 200,000 persons and killed around 20,000 of them in the sub-region in 1996, became a high&#13;
public health concern for the MSPAS and its partners in development.&#13;
2.11   Malaria. In Senegal, malaria is the main cause of morbidity, representing between 40&#13;
and 50 percent of all consultations (approximately 450,000 reported cases in 1994), one of the&#13;
main causes of mortality, and a major burden on society. Based on the sub-regional average cost&#13;
of a case of malaria, the economic burden of malaria represents 1 percent of GDP in Senegal&#13;
(around US$6 million).&#13;
2.12   The parasite is Plasmodiumfalciparum which can cause severe symptoms and lead&#13;
rapidly to death. The chief symptom of malaria is fever but the characteristics of the disease&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
vary with the intensity of the infection and the host's level of immunity. The risk of severe&#13;
malaria is almost exclusively limited to those who have not acquired a certain level of immunity.&#13;
The level of immunity depends on the level of transmission of the disease. Malaria is&#13;
responsible for high mortality in children from six months to five years of age (about 25 percent&#13;
of all deaths in these groups) who have not yet developed an immunity. Malaria also represents&#13;
a serious risk for pregnant women in a first or second pregnancy by causing low birth weight and&#13;
high neonatal mortality in first- and second-bom children. A more detailed description of&#13;
malaria issues in Senegal is attached in annex 3.&#13;
2.13   Human impact due to the disease varies with the great diversity in epidemiological&#13;
context and is considered close to the African average, i. e. five to six days' incapacity per acute&#13;
attack with an attack rate of 1.5 to 3 per year for children under five and 0.25 per year for older&#13;
children and adults. The burden of illness is compounded when affecting mothers of young&#13;
children, income-generating members of the family (particularly during outbreaks in the&#13;
agricultural season), and young children (which places heavy demands on mothers, affecting the&#13;
whole family). Based on sub-regional studies, malaria would account for about I I percent of all&#13;
disability adjusted years (DALYs) in Senegal, as in the rest of SSA.&#13;
2.14   Schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis results from a heavy infection with schistosome&#13;
trematode worms. Infection follows contact with water bodies contaminated with infected water&#13;
snails, which are the intermediate hosts of the parasite. Populations at risk are those who are in&#13;
frequent contact with contaminated water bodies, i.e. school-age children, rice-culture workers,&#13;
and to a lesser extent, women. The disease kills few people but has sapping chronic effects.&#13;
Depending on the type of schistosomiasis, the clinical manifestations of the disease involve&#13;
intestinal or urinary complications resulting from reactions to schistosome eggs lodged in these&#13;
tissues. Since the risk of complications is related to the intensity of infection, severe pathology&#13;
tends to be concentrated in the communities where prevalence is highest. A more detailed&#13;
description of the disease and related issues is attached in annex 4.&#13;
2.15   Statistically, the relative importance of schistosomiasis in the burden of infectious&#13;
diseases is still low in Senegal - 5,300 notified cases in 1994. But the development of&#13;
agricultural and irrigation projects which started in the 1980s have led to environmental changes&#13;
which favor the spread of schistosomiasis and the emergence of outbreaks such as the epidemic&#13;
of intestinal schistosomiasis in the St. Louis region. A prevalence map is attached in annex 4.&#13;
The rapid development of the epidemic of intestinal schistosomiasis in the St. Louis region and&#13;
the increase in prevalence and intensity rates of urinary schistosomiasis in the rest of the country&#13;
have rightly raised Govemment and Donor concem.&#13;
2.16   Intestinal schistosomiasis was not significant in Senegal until 1986. Since the start of&#13;
the Diama dam on the Senegal river in 1986, an epidemic has spread rapidly in the western part&#13;
of the St. Louis region (west to Podor) with a serious risk of extension to the rest of the Senegal&#13;
river valley. The epidemic has been characterized by an unceasing transmission, an extremely&#13;
rapid re-infestation rate, and high prevalence and intensity rates. Urinary schistosomiasis has&#13;
always been endemic in Senegal with a highly focal distribution. High prevalence rates were&#13;
found in scattered villages in the Tambacounda, Kolda, Kaolack and Diourbel regions. In the St.&#13;
Louis region, with the irrigation and rice development projects, it too has become epidemic,&#13;
though at a lower rate than intestinal shistosomiasis.&#13;
2.17   Onchocerciasis. Since 1986, the regional Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP), with&#13;
MSPAS support, has been responsible for controlling the morbidity due to onchocerciasis in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Senegal through an annual large-scale distribution of ivermectin. According to the devolution&#13;
process, i.e. process for transferring the responsibility of control activities to Participating&#13;
Countries, the Government of Senegal should take over this responsibility progressively and has&#13;
requested IDA support during the transition period. The endemic area covers 456 villages,&#13;
distributed in six counties of the Tambacounda region and one county of the Kolda region;&#13;
200,000 inhabitants are exposed. Demonstrated to be the most cost-effective and sustainable&#13;
ivermectin distribution system, community-based distribution has been implemented in 299&#13;
villages and should be extended over the next five years to the other 157 endemic villages. A&#13;
detailed description of the situation is attached in annex 5.&#13;
2.18   National Endemic Disease Service. Both before and since independence, the&#13;
organization of the surveillance and control of endemic and epidemic diseases has been under&#13;
the administration of the National Endemic Disease Serviceervice National des Grandes&#13;
Endemies (SNGE). The SNGE is one of the three National Services and four sub-Directorates&#13;
within the Hygiene and Public Health Directorate-Direction de l 'Hygiene et de la Sante&#13;
Publique (DHSP}-which is responsible for implementing the health policies adopted by the&#13;
Government. The SNGE includes a central unit with 6 high level staff, and 10 regional endemic&#13;
disease control units - Secteurs des Grandes Endemies (SGE) - with 4 medical doctors and 60&#13;
nurses and health assistants. An organizational chart of the MSPAS and the present distribution&#13;
of the SNGE personnel are described in annex 7.&#13;
2.19   Over the past 20 years, Senegal, like many Sub-Saharan African countries, did not&#13;
develop its capacities to control endemic and epidemic diseases. Resources allocated to the&#13;
SNGE steadily decreased to I percent of the MSPAS budget in 1995. Expensive&#13;
epidemiological surveillance and control activities could not be financed either by the meager&#13;
Government allocation of US$2 per capita/per year for the health sector, or by the population&#13;
which has no demand for these services.&#13;
2.20   Surveillance and control activities were mainly supported by the donor community with&#13;
a disease-by-disease and donor-by-donor approach. Although credited with some successes, this&#13;
approach was too costly to be sustainable due to the absence of rationalization in resource&#13;
utilization. In the 80s, donors' financial constraints imposed an arbitration between diseases for&#13;
financial support. Only a few diseases were accorded the benefit of a well-financed national&#13;
control program: leprosy, dracunculosis, onchocerciasis and the diseases of the Expanded&#13;
Program for Immunization (EPI). Human, material, and logistical resources were attributed to&#13;
these well-supported programs, but with no coordination or rationalization in their utilization&#13;
and management. As a consequence, some major diseases, such as malaria, schistosomiasis,&#13;
cerebral meningitis and hepatitis B, were not accorded effective surveillance and control&#13;
activities, leading to their recrudescence.&#13;
2.21   Epidemiological Surveillance System. The national epidemiological surveillance&#13;
system has been developed within the SIG but confined to passive surveillance indicators, i.e.&#13;
morbidity and mortality, based on health facilities reports. These indicators are generally non-&#13;
pertinent and unavailable for the decision-making process. In addition, the system does not&#13;
record risk indicators which could be used to prevent epidemics or recrudescence of endemics.&#13;
As a consequence, several national programs, such as the National Tuberculosis Control&#13;
Program, the National Leprosy Control Program, the Onchocerciasis Control Program, the&#13;
STD/AIDS Program, the EPI, and the Nutrition Program, developed their own information&#13;
systems. These information systems are centrally managed by the supervisor of the Program.&#13;
None of the existing information systems gives practically feedback to the staff at the periphery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
2.22   The Health Information System (SIG). The SIG is under the responsibility of the&#13;
Statistics Division-Division des Statistiques (DSTAT)- within the DHSP. In 1986 the first&#13;
reform of the SIG was initiated. It focused on the management of health services with data&#13;
concerning demography, morbidity, mortality, financing, and activities. From 1986 to 1993,&#13;
efforts were directed towards the standardization of forms and health indicators. In 1994,&#13;
supported by different partners, the MSPAS started computerizing the SIG with the development&#13;
of several types of software: (i) GESIB, monitoring the Bamako Initiative activities; (ii)&#13;
Logiciel Sante, monitoring data collected from health posts, including mortality and morbidity&#13;
data; (iii) SIGeo, background mapping and monitoring of malaria and schistosomiasis indicators&#13;
in the St. Louis region, and of dracunculosis in endemic areas; and (iv) the Family Planning&#13;
information system. Although promising, these efforts have suffered from a lack of coordination&#13;
and expertise in software development, and from the absence of a global plan for the SIG&#13;
development. A detailed analysis of issues related to the SIG are attached in Annex 6.&#13;
2.23   General Health Services. Since the mid-70s, the Government's policy in the health&#13;
sector has emphasized primary health care and preventive medicine and has accorded priority to&#13;
the delivery of basic health services to rural areas, where the great majority of the population&#13;
lives. A network of 750 health posts and around 8,000 village health workers (VHWs) form the&#13;
base of the health care system, serving as its first entry point. The key health providers are the&#13;
nurses who staff the health posts. They are responsible for a variety of curative and preventive&#13;
services, supervision and in-service training of the VHWs, health and nutrition education, and&#13;
record-keeping. Health problems that cannot be resolved at the village or health post level are&#13;
referred to the 52 health centers, which constitute the first level of referral and are usually&#13;
located in the district capital (department level). These centers are managed by one or two&#13;
medical doctors and are designed to provide out-patient and limited in-patient services and&#13;
laboratory services, as well as to supervise the health posts. In addition, the 45 health districts&#13;
have a Hygiene sub-unit.&#13;
2.24   The Country is divided into ten Medical Regions which correspond to the administrative&#13;
regions; each Medical Region is constituted of: a) a regional medical team located in the&#13;
regional capital and headed by the regional medical officer, b) a regional endemic disease&#13;
control unit-Secteur des Grandes Endemies (SGE), and c) a regional hygiene unit-Brigade&#13;
Regionale d 'Hygiene (BRH). With the exception of the Kolda and Fatick regions, each region&#13;
has a regional hospital located in the regional capital which constitutes the second referral level.&#13;
The St Louis region has, in addition, two hospitals in Dioum and Ouorossogui. Three national&#13;
hospitals, one university hospital, and a National Center for Tuberculosis located in Dakar&#13;
complete the national referral system. Drug procurement and distribution to the regions are&#13;
handled by the Pharmacie Nationale d'Approvisionnement (PNA)-a entity under the&#13;
jurisdiction of the MSPAS. PNA operates a network of five regional pharmacies-Pharmacie&#13;
Regionale d'Approvisionnement.&#13;
2.25   Following the Alma-Ata conference in 1978, the Government of Senegal undertook a&#13;
major reform to decentralize health services with community participation and to develop&#13;
primary health care with the definition of an integrated minimum package of activities. But&#13;
activities such as the surveillance and control of endemic and epidemic diseases, though&#13;
recognized as essential and with strong externalities, could not be integrated and were practically&#13;
left out of the reform process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
C. ISSUES&#13;
2.26   The global issue relates to the institutional weakness of the MSPAS in mobilizing and&#13;
managing its resources to control endemic and epidemic diseases of public health concern. Few&#13;
of these diseases are subjected to control activities and even so the management and financing of&#13;
these control programs stay out of MSPAS control. As a result, endemic diseases of high public&#13;
health importance such as malaria and schistosomiasis are only subject to limited control&#13;
activities.&#13;
2.27   The first specific issue relates to the SNGE's personnel. The fragmentation of the SNGE&#13;
organization has led to the loss of the SNGE mission, the deterioration of the team spirit, and the&#13;
degradation of the institutional capacity to tackle global and specific problems posed by endemic&#13;
and epidemic diseases. In fact, the SNGE mission is reduced to the management of the few well-&#13;
financed control programs without any search for rationalization and cost-effectiveness.&#13;
2.28   At the central level, the national coordinators are mostly involved in operational&#13;
activities of the control programs for which they are individually responsible and receive donor&#13;
financial and logistical support. As individual or as a group, there is no time given to the&#13;
conceptualization, monitoring and supervision of non-financed control programs. In addition,&#13;
the scattering of the SNGE offices in Dakar contributes to independent (non-cohesive or&#13;
duplicate) work and to a loss of cross-fertilization and team work.&#13;
2.29   At the peripheral levels, the personnel receives training for, and implement, only well-&#13;
funded control activities; and few of them are exposed to integrated training and supervision&#13;
programs. None of them are trained for non-funded disease control programs. For example,&#13;
training on malaria and schistosomiasis (with the exception of the St Louis region) control&#13;
activities is not provided at the peripheral levels. Moreover, there is no incentive for the staff to&#13;
promote flexibility and rational management in the utilization of logistic and financial resources.&#13;
2.30   The second specific issue is the lack of epidemiological intelligence due to the under-&#13;
development of the existing epidemiological surveillance system, and more generally of the&#13;
Health Management Information System (SIG). The utilization of the SIG as an alert system,&#13;
and in the programming, management, and monitoring of health activities is still very low for the&#13;
following reasons: (a) there are at least seven different forms to fill out and more than one&#13;
thousand data to report at the health post level each month; (b) many indicators are either&#13;
redundant or irrelevant; (c) the system does not allow rapid circulation and consultation of the&#13;
collected information; (d) there is no feedback information; and (e) there is no cross-circulation&#13;
of information allowing neighboring districts to have access to each other's data and&#13;
consequently benefit from each other's experience.&#13;
2.31 The third specific issue is the need to maintain a balance between the decentralization&#13;
process and the need for quality. Quality often requires technical expertise found mainly at the&#13;
regional and national levels. This issue relates not only to the frequency of the activities but also&#13;
to the evaluation of the staff capabilities, the relevance of training programs, as well as the&#13;
effectiveness of supervisions and support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
D. GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS AND THE BANK'S EXPERIENCE&#13;
Government Policy and Actions&#13;
2.32   The Government's commitment to the development of the health services is embodied in&#13;
the National Health Policy statement adopted in June 1989, and in the recently developed&#13;
document entitled "Nouvelles Orientations de la Politique de Sante et de l 'Action Sociale, juin&#13;
1995." This approach is consistent with the strategy outlined in the 1993 World Development&#13;
Report published by the World Bank, and the World Bank Africa Region policy paper, Better&#13;
Health in Africa, and constitutes a good framework for the development of the health sector.&#13;
Preparation of a ten-year National Health Development Plan and a five-year investment program&#13;
to implement this framework was completed in March 1997, with the support of multilateral and&#13;
bilateral donors.&#13;
2.33  In these documents the Government reaffirms its commitment to the reinforcement of&#13;
endemic disease control through the development and implementation of: (i) epidemiological&#13;
surveillance and control activities for endemic and epidemic diseases; (ii) a National Training&#13;
Policy which would be effective and integrated; and (iii) a computerized and integrated health&#13;
information system.&#13;
2.34   With regard to malaria control, the Republic of Senegal participated in the Ministerial&#13;
Conference on Malaria in Amsterdam in 1992 and co-signed the final Declaration, reaffirming&#13;
its commitment to pursuing malaria control as an essential element of the health development of&#13;
the country. A National Malaria Control Program was finalized in September 1995 based on the&#13;
strategy recommended by the Ministerial Conference. The strategy relies on the improvement of&#13;
case management at household and health facility levels, vector control with impregnated&#13;
bednets, and development of an epidemiological information system.&#13;
2.35   With regard to schistosomiasis control, in 1991 the Government created in the St. Louis&#13;
region the program ESPOIR to coordinate schistosomiasis-related research and control activities,&#13;
with the financial and technical support of the EU, the FAC, the Pasteur Institute and different&#13;
European universities.&#13;
The World Bank's Experience in Senegal&#13;
2.36   The World Bank Group's involvement in the health sector in Senegal includes the Rural&#13;
Health Project (Cr. 13 10-SEN), signed on February 2, 1983, and closed in 1989, whose objective&#13;
was to support the improvement of primary health care in rural areas, and the Human Resources&#13;
Development Project (Cr. 9180-SEN), closed in March 1997, whose health objectives were to&#13;
support the extension of primary health care services in three regions, the decentralization&#13;
nationwide of health planning and management, and the promotion of essential generic drugs.&#13;
2.37   The Rural Health Project had mixed success in attaining its objectives. Project activities&#13;
contributed to completing coverage nationwide with respect to health centers. However, the&#13;
accompanying improvements in service quality that were expected through the training have&#13;
been less satisfactory due principally to the lack of an integrated and well-defined training&#13;
strategy. Progress was made in the development of a pharmaceutical sector strategy, including&#13;
improvements in the official list of essential drugs, preparation of practical recommendations for&#13;
the reform of the National Pharmacy, and recommendations for improvements in the drug cost&#13;
recovery system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.38   The Human Resources Development Project has successfully tested the acceptability of&#13;
generic drugs and has demonstrated the willingness and ability of communities to pay for health&#13;
services as well as manage cost-recovery schemes. On the other hand, the project highlighted:&#13;
(a) the difficulties in dealing with human resource management reforms in the absence of greater&#13;
decentralization of health system management and broader civil service reform; (b) the limited&#13;
capacity of central administrative structures to redefine their roles away from direct control and&#13;
management toward strategic and support functions; and (c) the need for major legislative and&#13;
regulatory reform of the pharmaceutical sub-sector to achieve a meaningful shift to generic drug&#13;
procurement and distribution.&#13;
2.39   Upon Government request, a SIP is under preparation and will be appraised during&#13;
FY97. This program would contribute to provide the administrative structure for monitoring all&#13;
government and donor activities within the health sector and its sub-sectors, i. e. peripheral,&#13;
regional and central facilities, health finance, health insurance, human resource development.&#13;
The SIP would encompass the project.&#13;
2.40   The project would be launched approximately 12 months before SIP effectiveness.&#13;
Although the project was designed according to the National Health and Social Development&#13;
Plan, and developed in the context of the SIP preparation, the Government decided (with IDA&#13;
tacit agreement) to bring forward its implementation for two reasons. First, for the SIP to be&#13;
effective in developing and coordinating MSPAS and donor activities in the area of endemic&#13;
diseases control, the SNGE must be reformed and strengthened. Second, the SIP implementation&#13;
will require the development of a reliable health management information system. It will be a&#13;
great advantage for these elements to be well advanced when the SIP becomes effective. The&#13;
management of the proposed project will be merged with the SIP management when the latter is&#13;
in place.&#13;
Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.41   The Country Assistance Strategy aims to assist Senegal in reducing poverty by restoring&#13;
growth in per capita income. Part of the Government's strategy consists of improving the human&#13;
capital base through the provision of basic education and health services. To improve the health&#13;
of the population, health services should be able to control infectious diseases which are the&#13;
main cause of mortality and morbidity for every population cohort. By strengthening the&#13;
MSPAS capacity to control infectious diseases, the project would be an important mean of the&#13;
Bank's assistance strategy.&#13;
2.42  In recent years, through different initiatives worldwide, the Bank, in collaboration with&#13;
the Donor community, has been seeking to reduce the burden of malaria, schistosomiasis and&#13;
onchocerciasis, particularly with regard to women and children. It has been proven that these&#13;
three endemic diseases hamper human development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Controlling them&#13;
would thus have a strong economic rate of return. Given the fragmented donors' support in the&#13;
area of surveillance and control of endemic disease, with the current program-by-program and&#13;
donor-by-donor approach, IDA is the only possible support to Government efforts in designing&#13;
and implementing a comprehensive institutional reform in this area. The traditional role the&#13;
Bank has played in promoting supportive and effective donor coordination will be crucial in this&#13;
area, as well as in that of the SIG development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2.43   In addition, many components of the project have financial requirements that are beyond&#13;
the capacity of local resources or those available through existing or planned donor programs.&#13;
The IDA Credit sought by the Government would complement these resources.&#13;
2.44   The proposed project is the first IDA credit aiming specifically to strengthen the&#13;
surveillance and control of endemic disease in Senegal, as well as throughout the West-African&#13;
sub-region. However, the Bank has supported similar projects in Brazil and Egypt. Project&#13;
preparation and design have benefited from the experience gained through these projects.&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY&#13;
3.1    Project Objectives. The global objective of the project is to support the Government in&#13;
its efforts to alleviate the burden of endemic and epidemic diseases on the Senegalese&#13;
populations, with, in particular, a reduction of the burden of malaria, schistosomiasis and&#13;
onchocerciasis. In its Letter of Sub-Sector Policy (Annex 2), Government has established the&#13;
following benchmarks for the year 2002: (a) reduce by 25 percent the infant mortality&#13;
attributable to malaria; (b) reduce by 90 percent the school-age children morbidity attributable&#13;
to urinary schistosomiasis; and (c) eliminate the risk of blindness due to onchocerciasis.&#13;
Progress toward these objectives would be assessed with a Burden of Disease Analysis and an&#13;
economic analysis based on data twice collected by the SIG--once after two years of SIG&#13;
implementation, and again at project completion. During negotiations, Governmentfurnished&#13;
the Letter of Sub-Sector Policy, including the project monitoring indicators (para. 6.1 (a)).&#13;
3.2    Project Strategy. The project strategy is two-fold. First, the project aims to&#13;
demonstrate, with the example of the management of malaria, schistosomiasis and&#13;
onchocerciasis surveillance and control activities, the feasibility, effectiveness and efficiency of&#13;
developing the concept of integration within the peripheral health services, in conjunction with&#13;
the community. By project completion, it would be desirable that control activities for the&#13;
endemic and epidemic diseases of public health importance be fully integrated. Second, the&#13;
project aims to reinforce the national capacity in conceptualizing, managing and conducting&#13;
endemic and epidemic disease control activities by reforming the SNGE at central and peripheral&#13;
levels and implementing nationwide a computerized health management information system,&#13;
including an epidemiological surveillance system.&#13;
3.3    Project Scope. The project would be implemented nationwide, with the exception of the&#13;
schistosomiasis control activities in the St. Louis region. These control activities will not be&#13;
subjected to a specific support from the project for the following reasons: (a) they are subjected&#13;
to several donor's supports, particularly to an important EU's support; (b) the EU is considering&#13;
to increase its financial support; and (c) an additional support in controlling the epidemic will be&#13;
forthcoming from the proposed World Bank Regional Hydropower Development Project&#13;
(scheduled for May 1997 Board consideration), with the financing of feasibility studies for&#13;
reducing the man-vector contacts in infected villages. However, the project will contribute to the&#13;
global effort against the epidemic through the national and local reinforcement of the SNGE.&#13;
The execution of the pilot projects would be coordinated by the Organization for the&#13;
Development of the Senegal River (OMVS) which will work closely with the St. Louis Medical&#13;
Region staff, the Program ESPOIR, and the SNGE.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.4    Project Components. To help achieve these objectives, the project would support&#13;
policy measures and investments designed to: (a) improve the management and implementation&#13;
of malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis control activities at central and peripheral levels;&#13;
(b) develop an integrated and computerized health management information system (SIG) and its&#13;
use; and c) strengthen the SNGE capabilities at central and peripheral levels and the DHSP&#13;
ability in project management. The composition of the investment program is summarized&#13;
below.&#13;
3.5    Progress in achieving sectoral development and project implementation objectives would&#13;
be measured against a set of monitoring indicators, developed by and agreed upon with the&#13;
Government. They would form an integral part of the Government's Letter of Sub-Sector&#13;
Policy. Measurable indicators are listed in Annex 1. Recurrent cost implications and resulting&#13;
budget shares are given in Annex 11.&#13;

L. Support to Malaria, Schistosomiasis and Onchocerciasis Control Activities (US$4.61&#13;
million)&#13;
3.6    The overall objective of this component is to initiate and develop at the peripheral levels&#13;
an operational and managerial organization in the area of surveillance and control of endemic&#13;
and epidemic diseases. The project would specifically support this effort for three endemic&#13;
diseases, i.e. malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis, expecting this approach could then be&#13;
extended to all endemic and epidemic diseases. Surveillance and control activities would be&#13;
included in the five-year District and Regional Health Development Plans to be adjusted each&#13;
year according to the decentralization process. The budget allocation process, including&#13;
allocations provided for under this project, would be based on these plans after revision and&#13;
adjustments by the MSPAS and Donors, once the SIP becomes effective. Central and regional&#13;
SNGE staff would support medical districts and regions in the elaboration of these plans.&#13;
(a)    Operational Activities (US$3.64 million)&#13;
3.7    Scope and Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to implement malaria,&#13;
schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis control activities at peripheral levels with an eye to&#13;
rationalization and sustainability. Control of endemic diseases, in particular malaria,&#13;
schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis, ensues from the disease-specific adjustment of the following&#13;
generic activities: (a) the improvement of the quality of case management at health facilities&#13;
through training of care providers in diagnosis, treatment, referral practices, counseling and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
interpersonal communication; (b) the improvement of the case management and prevention at&#13;
the household level through information and education campaigns covering recognition of signs&#13;
and symptoms of illness, appropriate treatment and proper health-seeking behaviors; (c) the&#13;
implementation of large-scale treatment or prevention campaigns for targeted populations; and&#13;
(d) the use of selective measures against vectors. Specific guidelines pertaining to each of the&#13;
three diseases targeted by the project are developed below.&#13;
Improvement of Case Management at Health Facilities.&#13;
3.8    Regarding malaria, the project aims to improve, via training of health care providers,&#13;
the management of patients with fever illness, primarily among children under five, and the&#13;
prevention or management of malaria and anemia in pregnant women. Regarding&#13;
schistosomiasis, the project aims to improve, via training of health post nurses, the diagnosis by&#13;
developing the utilization of chemical reagent strips, and the treatment by promoting the&#13;
prescription of praziquantel. The SGEs would organize with the support of trainers, i.e. medical&#13;
district officers, hospital medical doctors lab assistants, the training of 1,100 nurses and&#13;
midwives and 160 private practitioners. Trainers would be trained through regular programs to&#13;
be organized in the context of the strengthening of the SNGE.&#13;
3.9   Project Support. The project would finance: (a) the training of nurses, midwives and&#13;
practitioners; and (b) the supplying of an initial stock of praziquantel and chemical reagent&#13;
strips (approximately 2,000 tablets and 1,000 strips for each of the 320 health centers and posts)&#13;
whose replenishment would be covered by the health post income.&#13;
Population Information and Education&#13;
3.10.  Regarding malaria, the project aims to improve at the household level the management&#13;
of fever in children under five through information an education of household caretakers, and&#13;
raise the awareness of pregnant women in order to develop their demand for health services and&#13;
prevention measures. Regarding schistosomiasis, the project aims to increase, via information&#13;
and education, the population awareness, in particular the high-risk schoolchildren population, to&#13;
improve their knowledge about: (a) the disease cycle, symptoms and risks; (b) the prevention&#13;
measures; and (c) the personal and community hygiene and sanitation.&#13;
3.11   The SNGE would contract out the design of IEC campaigns and the production of&#13;
posters, leaflets, batiks and boites a images. Household caretakers would be reached with the&#13;
help of the national federation of women's association (La Federation Nationale des&#13;
Groupements Feminins). In each region, district and village, the association would organize&#13;
regular talks and chats with the support of the information tools mentioned above. UNICEF&#13;
would technically support the training of opinion leaders and the organization of the talks and&#13;
chats. These activities would be done on an integrated basis whenever warranted. School&#13;
children would receive public health instruction, particularly regarding schistosomiasis, from&#13;
their school teachers who will have been properly trained by the SGE staff with UNICEF&#13;
support.&#13;
3.12   Project Support. The project would finance: (i) consultant services for the design and&#13;
production of national IEC campaigns; (ii) the education of opinion leaders and school teachers;&#13;
and (iii) the organization of monthly talks and chats by the national federation of women's&#13;
association for the benefit of household caretakers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Large Scale Treatment and Selective Measures Against Vectors&#13;
3.13   Malaria. The project aims to support selective vector control through the development&#13;
of the nighttime utilization of bednets impregnated with insecticide-Niclosamide. Experience&#13;
in Gambia has shown that the use of bednets can produce an important reduction in childhood&#13;
mortality and morbidity, when it is accepted by the population. But the Gambian experience was&#13;
successful only as long as the impregnation was provided free of charge. As a lesson from the&#13;
Gambian experience, it would be premature and risky in Senegal to determine up-front the&#13;
strategy for bednet distribution and impregnation.&#13;
3.14   The project strategy is to employ a sequential approach. The SNGE, with the technical&#13;
support of WHO, would conduct: (a) during the first year, operational research projects and&#13;
studies of the opportunities and modalities for support to local production and commercialization&#13;
of bednets, of different options for the organization of impregnation, and of possible&#13;
implementation of a cost recovery system; (b) during the second year, the testing of one or two&#13;
alternatives of organization and functioning of the system and their articulation within the health&#13;
services; and (c) during the last three years, the full incorporation of the assessed strategy into&#13;
the health services. Given the financial constraints of both the population and the Government,&#13;
the project has anticipated, for financing, the results of the operation research and has considered&#13;
to support the implementation of a private production of bednets, and a Government-supported&#13;
impregnation system. The BRHs would be responsible for the bednet impregnation, and their&#13;
staff would receive appropriate training, organized by the SNGE.&#13;
3.15   Schistosomiasis. The project aims to control the transmission in highly focal&#13;
transmission villages through the concomitant use of molluscicides-niclosamide-against&#13;
vectors and the large-scale distribution of praziquantel to schoolchildren. During the first year of&#13;
the project, it is planed to treat the 60 villages identified during the prevalence study in March&#13;
1996 with an initial prevalence rate among school children of over 50 percent. During the&#13;
following years, high-transmission villages and hamlets would be identified by local infection&#13;
and re-infection rates in humans to be evaluated by rapid epidemiological assessment to be&#13;
jointly conducted by SGE and district teams.&#13;
3.16   School teachers would carry out the distribution of praziquantel to the schoolchildren&#13;
population of identified villages, under the supervision of medical district teams and SGEs with&#13;
UNICEF technical support. The project has estimated that approximately 3,000 school children&#13;
would be treated the first year; the number of children to be treated decreasing the following&#13;
years. Appropriate treatment of infected ponds and water bodies with niclosamide in identified&#13;
villages would be carried out by the BRHs' staff who would have received an appropriate&#13;
training to be organized by the SNGE. At the end of the first three years of this operation, the&#13;
SNGE would conduct an assessment study to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and cost of&#13;
focal mollusciciding, concentrating on the reduction of incidence and re-infection rates in treated&#13;
villages and research results.&#13;
3.17   Onchocerciasis. The project aims to generalize and consolidate the ivermectin&#13;
community-distribution system in the onchocerciasis areas. The strategy consists of: (a) the&#13;
training of health post nurses in supervision of the distribution of ivermectin by VHWs; (b) the&#13;
identification and training of 314 VHWs by the regional and district teams in the remaining 157&#13;
villages; (c) the provision of ivermectin from the district to the village via the health post; and&#13;
(d) the information and education of the population of the 456 exposed villages. Ivermectin will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
be given free of charge by the pharmaceutical company Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme for as long as&#13;
necessary.&#13;
3.18   Project Support. The project would finance: (a) the procurement and distribution of&#13;
150,000 bednets and 18.000 liters of deltamethrine in the context of the operational research, of&#13;
2 tons of niclosamid and 5.000 tablets of praziquantel for urinary schistosomiasis vector control&#13;
and large-scale treatment of the schoolchildren population respectively, of ivermectin; and of&#13;
consumables; (b) the supervision missions; (c) assessment studies of the different options to&#13;
implement a sustainable market of impregnated bednets; (d) malacological and sociological&#13;
studies in highly infected areas with schistosomiasis; (e) an evaluation study at the end of the&#13;
three years of schistosomiasis control activities; (f) training of BRHs staff in the utilization of&#13;
deltamethrine and niclosamide; (g) training of approximately 400 health post nurses and VHW&#13;
in ivermectin community distribution; and (h) the organization of yearly information and&#13;
education campaigns in the 456 villages exposed to onchocerciasis. WHO-Afro would&#13;
technically support the operational research related to the development of the utilization of&#13;
impregnated bednets.&#13;
3.19   Implementation Arrangements. The SNGE and SGEs would be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of this sub-component jointly with medical district and regional teams.&#13;
Activities related to the treatment with niclosamide, and to the bednet impregnation with&#13;
deltamethrine would be carried out by the BRHs. Activities related to the education and&#13;
information of the household caretakers would be carried out by the national federation of&#13;
women's associations (La Feidration Nationale des Groupements Fiminins) with the technical&#13;
assistance of UNICEF. Operational research and studies relating to the development of the&#13;
utilization of impregnated bednets, to be conducted during the first two years, would be entrusted&#13;
to the WHO resident mission in Senegal under the general responsibility of the SNGE.&#13;
Procurement, stocking, and distribution of bednets, deltamethrine, niclosamide, praziquantel and&#13;
ivermectin would be the responsibility of the PNA at the central and regional levels, and of the&#13;
medical districts from the regional level to villages.&#13;
(b)    Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.97 million)&#13;
3.20   Scope and Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to develop capacity not&#13;
only at central level but also at regional and district levels to monitor and analyze data relevant&#13;
to the surveillance and control of malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis. The&#13;
empowerment of peripheral staff in the management of surveillance and control activities would&#13;
strongly implement the concept of integration and rationalization in the domain of endemic and&#13;
epidemic disease control. Using the analytic and connecting capabilities of the computerized&#13;
SIG, the SNGE would develop a malaria outbreak prevention system, to be extended to other&#13;
diseases later on. It would also conduct operational research and evaluation studies related to&#13;
malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis. As onchocerciasis is concerned, the OCP would&#13;
provide technical assistance to the SNGE in the area of operational research, and in ivermectin&#13;
donation applications.&#13;
3.21   Outbreak Prevention System. The development of forecasting and prevention&#13;
strategies for malaria outbreaks will be undertaken in the area along the Senegal river valley, i.e.&#13;
the St. Louis Region and the Bakel district of the Tambacounda Region. These areas of unstable&#13;
malaria transmission are affected by periodic local outbreaks which may produce serious&#13;
increases of mortality and incapacity. The SNGE and the St. Louis SGE with the support of&#13;
WHO and short-term technical assistance would undertake:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
(a)    during the first year: (i) the study of potential determinants of epidemic risk in&#13;
the area; (ii) the mapping of the areas affected by each major determinant and&#13;
the identification of localities at risk; (iii) the definition of indicators with&#13;
predictive value; and (iv) the negotiation for the acquisition of timely&#13;
information on their variation;&#13;
(b)    during the second year: (i) the validation and incorporation of indicators into the&#13;
SIG; (ii) the organization of alarm mechanisms, emergency preparedness and&#13;
response capabilities; and (iii) the evaluation of the system; and&#13;
(c)    during the last three years, the operationalization of the system and the extension&#13;
to other epidemic diseases.&#13;
3.22   Operational Research and Evaluation. The SNGE and SGEs with the support of&#13;
short-term technical assistance would undertake regular studies and operational research to&#13;
assess:&#13;
(a)    with regard to malaria, (i) the validity of regular malaria morbidity and&#13;
mortality reporting; (ii) drug resistance; (iii) mosquito resistance to insecticide;&#13;
(iv) malaria case containment at the community level; (v) chemoprophylaxis for&#13;
pregnant women; and (vi) the acceptability of impregnated bednets;&#13;
(b)    with regard to schistosomiasis, (i) the prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in&#13;
the treated population in the context of the project; (ii) the quality of field&#13;
management and program management; (iii) the snail control techniques; and&#13;
(iv) the development of new health education, management, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation and surveillance approaches.  Priority topics for the operational&#13;
program are presented in Annex 4; and&#13;
(c)    with regard to onchocerciasis, the quality of information and education&#13;
activities.&#13;
3.23   Project Support. The project would finance: (i) consultant services for the studies and&#13;
operational research; (ii) equipment and furniture; and (iii) operating costs.&#13;
II. Health Management Information System (US$3.26 million)&#13;
3.24   The objectives of this component are: (i) to implement a national computerized network&#13;
between the district, regional and central levels of the MSPAS to support an integrated, flexible&#13;
and communicative SIG, and develop its management and utilization by the health staff at each&#13;
level of the health pyramid; and (ii) to build the capacity within the MSPAS to monitor, evaluate&#13;
and improve the utilization of the SIG. The opportunity of live communication offered by the&#13;
network between district, regional and central health facilities would benefit the development of&#13;
feedback information which has been demonstrated to be a major incentive for peripheral health&#13;
staff to comply with policies and strategies. A description of the computerized network&#13;
supporting the SIG is detailed in annex 6.&#13;
3.25   In the specific context of control of endemic and epidemic diseases, the SIG with its&#13;
epidemiological surveillance and alert system would be of the highest importance because fast&#13;
reaction and control strategy adjustment depend on the capacities to be informed as early as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
possible with relevant indicators and analysis. The computerization of the SIG would also allow&#13;
the integration of environmental and geographical data in the analysis process and its&#13;
instantaneous distribution nationwide. This capacity would be particularly relevant to the&#13;
suiveillance of severe Sahelian malaria outbreaks which are often linked to the pluviometry and&#13;
ocod levels.&#13;
3.26   A Health Information Council would be created to regulate and monitor the use of the&#13;
SIG, and evaluate the impact on the MSPAS work culture. During its first years of existence, it&#13;
is expected that the SIG would not only evolve but also initiate an evolution within the MSPAS.&#13;
As mentioned earlier, the new internal connectivity would bring about a major culture change&#13;
within the MSPAS services, which should be carefully assessed and taken into account in the&#13;
reflection about future reforms and global programs in the sector. This Council would include as&#13;
a rtinimum the heads of the MSPAS Directorates and Services, university and research experts,&#13;
and the MSPAS partners in development. A permanent secretariat would be held by the DSTAT.&#13;
(a)    System Development and Implementation (US$2.48 million)&#13;
3.27   Scope and Objectives. The objective of the sub-component is the implementation and&#13;
utilization of a national computerized network which would support and integrate all present and&#13;
future health information systems. The DHSP, with the assistance of the consulting firm Mazars&#13;
&amp; Guerard acting as contract manager, would: (a) analyze the existing specific health&#13;
information systems; (b) rationalize and structure the computerized SIG data collection and&#13;
analysis (cahier des charges); (c) establish the specifications and procedures for the&#13;
procurement of 12 servers (one in each region and two at the center), 141 computers (50 at the&#13;
center, three per MR, and one per medical district), and server software and consumables as&#13;
necessary to allow network implementation; (d) elaborate terms of reference and selection&#13;
processes for specialist services in charge of developing the network software, testing the system&#13;
in one pilot area, extending it nationwide and training staff in network utilization; and (e)&#13;
r onitor the contract execution and establish certification of services rendered until full&#13;
completion. The DHSP via its sub-Directorates and Services would undertake, with the&#13;
assistance of USAID, UNICEF and EU, the organization of training programs in the utilization&#13;
of the SIG in the following components: epidemiological surveillance, Family Planning, and&#13;
more generally health district activities management.&#13;
3.28   Project Support. The project would finance: (a) the procurement of servers,&#13;
computers, server's software and consumables; (b) the specialist services for the contract&#13;
management, and the development of the software; and (c) the training of district and regional&#13;
officers, as well as the SNGE staff, in the utilization of the SIG for epidemiological surveillance&#13;
purposes. The EU would finance temporary technical assistance to support training in the&#13;
utilization of this software.&#13;
3.29   Implementation Arrangements. Contract management for the development of the&#13;
computerized network will be contracted on a single-source selection basis to Mazars &amp; Guerard&#13;
for continuity purpose since the firm has designed the system to the satisfaction of Government&#13;
and the donors during project preparation. Two package sets would be subjected to ICB. The&#13;
first would relate to goods and include the hardware equipment, the second would relate to&#13;
consultant services and include the software programming, network implementation, training and&#13;
skill transfer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
(b)    Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.78 million)&#13;
3.30   Scope and Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to reinforce the&#13;
capacities of the MSPAS to manage the SIG by: (i) strengthening the DSTAT-Service des&#13;
Statistiques-in maintenance, monitoring and evaluation of the SIG; and (ii) creating the Health&#13;
Information Council. To guarantee a high sustainability level for the network technical&#13;
maintenance by the DSTAT, the MSPAS would contract, on a two year basis, a local private&#13;
computer maintenance firm to provide two computer engineers as long term technical assistants&#13;
to the DSTAT.&#13;
3.31   Project Support. The project would finance: (i) consultant services of the local private&#13;
firm to provide the two computer engineers; (ii) consultant services to assist the Health&#13;
Information Council in conducting studies and organizing regular conferences and workshops;&#13;
and (iii) on a declining basis, incremental recurrent costs incurred by the network utilization,&#13;
such as consumables, maintenance equipment and telephone communication.&#13;
3.32   Implementation Arrangements. The implementation of the sub-component would be&#13;
the responsibility of the Head of the DSTAT. The project management will be responsible for&#13;
the recruitment and monitoring of the local firm to provide two computer scientist engineers.&#13;
lII. Institutional Strengthening of the SNGE (US$ 7.31 million)&#13;
3.33   The global objective of this component is to rebuild the institutional capacity of the&#13;
SNGE to efficiently survey and control endemic and epidemic diseases. The mandate and&#13;
organization of the SNGE would be redefined in the context of the decentralization of the health&#13;
services and the search for better rationalization in resources utilization. As a condition for&#13;
Credit effectiveness, the Government will adopt a new organizational and administrative&#13;
structure of the SNGE, satisfactory to IDA (para 6.3 (a)). The strategy would consist in first&#13;
developing the capacity to conceptualize and manage surveillance and control programs at the&#13;
central level; and second in reinforcing the capacity to adjust and implement these programs at&#13;
the regional and district levels.&#13;
(a)    Strengthening the Central Level of the SNGE (US$ 3.81 million)&#13;
3.34   Scope and Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to develop at the central&#13;
level a highly competent team of civil servants with a strong team spirit and public health&#13;
interest. The strategy would consist of: (a) regrouping the SNGE scattered staff within a&#13;
renovated state-owned building, accommodating the other DHSP services and directorates, and&#13;
the other MSPAS Services as well; (b) building up the team spirit among the staff, with the&#13;
support of consultant services; (c) developing staff capacities through training courses; and (d)&#13;
providing SNGE with resources to achieve its mission. In the particular context of the project,&#13;
and in line with its mandate, the SNGE would: (a) organize annual refresher courses for its staff;&#13;
(b) revise and/or design national control programs for endemic and epidemic diseases, with&#13;
consecutive training modules and guidelines; (c) organize national information campaigns; (d)&#13;
hold regular and frequent meetings with the decentralized staff during the first years to&#13;
implement the new culture and mission of the SNGE; and (e) undertake Burden of Disease&#13;
Analysis and sound economic analysis.&#13;
3.35   Project Support. The project would finance: a) the civil works to rehabilitate the state-&#13;
owned building; b) equipment and furniture to the DHSP and DAGE; c) five vehicles for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
SNGE central unit; d) the local and international consultant services for: (i) the design and&#13;
supervision of the civil works, (ii) the build-up of teamwork and esprit de corps, (iii) the design&#13;
of national control programs, (iv) the preparation of two burden of diseases analysis and&#13;
economic analysis, and (v) the design and implementation of national information campaigns; e)&#13;
the training and study tours for the staff; and f) the recurrent costs incurred by the regular&#13;
operations, maintenance and supervision activities such as vehicle operation and maintenance,&#13;
and staff travel allowances.&#13;
3.36   During negotiations, the Government submitted to IDA the documents showing that the&#13;
building to be rehabilitated is state-owned and has been officially earmarkedfor the MSPAS&#13;
(para. 6.1 (b)).&#13;
3.37   Implementation Arrangements. The civil works component including the&#13;
procurement of furniture and equipment for office rehabilitation, will be given to the executing&#13;
agency AGETIP which will be in charge of contract management (Maitre d'Ouvrage Delegue),&#13;
consultant services, and suppliers and contractors.&#13;
(b)    Strengthening District and Regional Capacities (US$ 3.31 million)&#13;
3.38   Scope and Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to build capacity at&#13;
regional and district levels to implement and manage activities related to the surveillance and&#13;
control of endemic and epidemic diseases. In line with the decentralization process and&#13;
development of Regional Health Development Plans, SGEs staff would be responsible for&#13;
adjusting to local situations (even conceptualizing to a certain extent), implementing, and&#13;
supervising these national control programs. SGEs'staff would participate to the preparation of&#13;
Regional and District Health Plans. A plan would be developed to integrate SGE activities with&#13;
the Medical Region activities and to rationalize the human, material, and financial resources of&#13;
both teams. The strategy would consist of: a) bringing the SGE and Medical Region teams&#13;
closer together through the relocation of SGE facilities onto the Medical Region premises,&#13;
whenever necessary and feasible; b) upgrading through training the capacity of SGE and district&#13;
staff to execute their mission; and c) providing facilities and budget for supervision and IEC&#13;
activities, focal studies and surveys.&#13;
3.39   Training would be available for district and regional medical officers, and for hospital&#13;
and district laboratory assistants. The training program would consist of annual refresher&#13;
courses and opportunities for short-term training in Centres d 'excellence in countries within the&#13;
sub-region. Training will be crucial for medical officers and staff of the SGEs to successfully&#13;
carry out the responsibilities resulting from the decentralization process. Due to the project-by-&#13;
project approach it has always been difficult to integrate the training activities for the different&#13;
disease control programs. First, a pilot course of integrated training would be provided for lab&#13;
assistants. Second, SGE and district medical staff would receive an integrated training on the&#13;
surveillance and control activities of malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis. To design&#13;
these training courses the SNGE would contract experts from local universities, hospitals, and&#13;
scientific institutions. Eventually, these courses would become part of the national training&#13;
program after a review and evaluation process.&#13;
3.40   The financial ability to carry out regular and frequent supervision, focal studies and&#13;
surveys would be essential to the SGE and medical district teams. Facilities and budget would&#13;
be provided by the project for two years; future budget needs should be assessed in the context of&#13;
the Regional and District Health Development Plans prepared in the context of the SIP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
3.41   Project Support. The project would finance: (a) renovation costs to integrate the SGE&#13;
offices within the medical Region premises and prepare one apartment for the SGE medical&#13;
chief; (b) equipment and furniture for each SGE office and the laboratory equipment for each&#13;
medical district lab; (c) two vehicles per SGE; (d) consultant services for the design and&#13;
supervision of civil works, and for the design and organization of regional IEC campaign on&#13;
endemic and epidemic disease control; (e) the training component for annual refresher courses&#13;
for regional and district staff and supervisors, as well as for laboratory assistants and short-term&#13;
training in the sub-region; and (f) the recurrent costs incurred by the supervision activities by&#13;
SGEs and medical district staff, including the operation and maintenance of office equipment&#13;
and vehicles.&#13;
(c)    Project Management (US$0.19 million)&#13;
3.42   Scope and Objectives. Until the SIP is in place, the financial and technical&#13;
management of the project would be the responsibility of the Deputy-Director of DHSP. He&#13;
would be assisted by a project officer whose assignment would be on a bi-annual assignment&#13;
basis, renewable with satisfactory performance, and whose terms of reference and qualifications&#13;
would be acceptable to IDA. In addition, support would be provided by the accountant of the&#13;
DHSP whose qualifications are acceptable to IDA, and one secretary hired on a contractual basis.&#13;
Audits, paid for by the Project, would be done every year. To enable the DHSP to carry out the&#13;
project-related activities upon project start, a limited quantity of equipment will be provided&#13;
early on. Facilities and non-incremental recurrent budget expenditures would be provided by the&#13;
Government to allow effective project implementation.&#13;
3.43   When the SIP is in place, the financial management of the project would be merged into&#13;
the SIP management within the DAGE. Management of project technical activities would&#13;
continue to be the responsibility of the DHSP.&#13;
3.44   Project Support. The project would finance: (i) office equipment and furniture; (ii) 2&#13;
vehicles; (iii) consultant services for audit, accountant and short-term support services; and (iv)&#13;
the recurrent costs incurred by the operation and maintenance of office equipment and vehicles.&#13;
C. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
3.45   Project Cost. The total cost of the project, including taxes, is estimated at about&#13;
US$17.0 million, with a base cost of US$15.2 million and a foreign exchange component of&#13;
US$9.8 million. Price contingencies estimated at US$0.8 million, assume an annual domestic&#13;
inflation of 3 percent and a foreign inflation rate of 3 percent. Physical contingencies are&#13;
estimated at about US$1.0 million (6 percent of base cost). IDA would finance about 87.6&#13;
percent of total project costs (US$14.9 million). The Government would contribute US$0.9&#13;
million equivalent. The European Union (EU) would finance US$0.3 million equivalent. The&#13;
French Government would finance US$0.7 million equivalent. UNICEF would finance US$0.1&#13;
million equivalent. WHO would finance US$0.1 million equivalent. Detailed project costs are&#13;
provided in Annex 11.&#13;
3.46   Recurrent Costs Implications. Total recurrent costs generated by the project are&#13;
estimated at around US$2.46 million for the life of the project, with an annual average of&#13;
US$0.49 million. During the implementation phase of the project, the Government's share of the&#13;
expenditures is estimated at 10 percent for administrative costs, cost of goods and works, or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
approximately US$0.4 million. At project closing, for proceeding with different activities, the&#13;
Government will allocate to US$1.66 million, corresponding to the project's supervision costs as&#13;
well as the additional costs associated with its activities, including the purchase of consumable&#13;
goods, vehicle maintenance, equipment and materials, and contracts for the maintenance of the&#13;
computer information network by a private sector operator. Pharmaceutical acquisitions will be&#13;
assured by the beneficiaries. Throughout the duration of the project, additional expenditures&#13;
should correspond to 13.8 percent of actual investments, of which US$0.4 million will form part&#13;
of the Government's budget and shall represent 0.6 percent of the MSPAS budget, following the&#13;
hypothesis of evolution as described above and projected for the year 2000.&#13;
3.47   Cost-effectiveness Analysis. Strategies adopted by the MSPAS in the control of&#13;
malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis have been proven on several occasions to be cost-&#13;
effective, in particular in countries within the sub-region. Nevertheless, it would be necessary to&#13;
assess the cost-effectiveness of each strategy in the global context of the cost of control activities&#13;
for all diseases. As a prerequisite for such evaluation, a valid health management information&#13;
system is essential. Given the scope and precedence of the proposed project, a Burden of&#13;
Disease Analysis and an economic analysis based on data collected by the SIG would be done&#13;
twice--once after two years of SIG implementation and once at project completion.&#13;
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION AND READINESS&#13;
4.1    History and Development of the Project. Financial requests made by the Republic of&#13;
Senegal to IDA for the National Malaria Control Program and the Onchocerciasis Devolution&#13;
Plan initiated a dialogue with the MSPAS on the merits and potential for the proposed project. A&#13;
project identification mission in October 1995 assessed the overall rationale and feasibility of&#13;
strengthening the national capacity for surveillance and control of endemic diseases. During the&#13;
project identification mission, the DHSP held a seminar to define the framework of the proposed&#13;
project. Preparation missions in February and April 1996 were able to make considerable&#13;
progress in project preparation and in coordination between all different programs and donors.&#13;
Revision of the project proposals as agreed with the preparatory missions was accomplished&#13;
smoothly by the Government and the project was appraised in December 1996.&#13;
4.2    With regards to the malaria sub-component, the implementation manual of the control&#13;
program was finalized during the preparation stage. The project preparation stage was used to&#13;
develop a constituency around the National Malaria Control Program. Eighteen operational&#13;
research papers were produced through a joint-venture between the MSPAS staff and the Dakar&#13;
Medical University staff and students. There has been an agreement between all actors on the&#13;
key issues, the strategy to solve them and the implementing agency. At the same time, training&#13;
activities for field staff were launched to try to curb the impact of the malarial season in October&#13;
and November 1996.&#13;
B. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.3    Until the SIP is in place, management and coordination of project activities will be&#13;
carried out by the DHSP of the Ministry of Health. The Deputy-Director of the DHSP will be&#13;
appointed as the project Director and receive the responsibility of facilitating the coordination of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
activities among different departments of the MSPAS involved in the project implementation.&#13;
The organigramme of the DHSP is in annex 7. Day-to-day activities will be carried out by a&#13;
project manager who will be assisted by the DHSP accountant and a secretary. The project&#13;
manager who is also a DHSP staff has been designated during project preparation and has&#13;
received training sponsored by the Bank in disbursement and procurement procedures. During&#13;
negotiations, the Government appointed. the Deputy-Director of DHSP as the Project Director,&#13;
the project manager and DHSP accountant whose qualifications and terms of reference are&#13;
acceptable to IDA (para. 6.1 (c)). When the SIP is in place, the financial management of the&#13;
project would be merged into the SIP management within the DAF. Management of project&#13;
technical activities would continue to be the responsibility of the DHSP.&#13;
4.4    Coordination and consolidation of financial accounts and monitoring of project&#13;
implementation outcomes will be under the responsibility of the project manager who will ensure&#13;
that the following tasks are oarried out: (a) coordination of the preparation of annual work&#13;
programs and budget for all project components; (b) procurement of goods and services, and&#13;
recruitment of consultants; (c) maintaining and consolidating all project accounts, including the&#13;
special account; (d) preparation of necessary documentation for withdrawal of proceeds from the&#13;
Credit account; (e) making arrangements for the audit of project accounts and Statement of&#13;
Expenses; and (f) organization of annual and mid-term reviews of project implementation.&#13;
C. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.5    The monitoring and evaluation of project performance and outcomes are an integral part&#13;
of each component and will be carried out by the respective component implementation units&#13;
over the life of the project, with the DHSP playing a coordinating role. Key monitoring&#13;
indicators are shown in Annex 1. In its role as project coordinator, the DHSP will organize in&#13;
November of each year, beginning in 1997, a joint IDA-Government review of project&#13;
implementation with the participation of other development partners, based on the progress&#13;
reports and expenditure statements of the past year, and annual work programs and budgets for&#13;
the following year. In addition, the DHSP will prepare a mid-term review of project&#13;
implementation, to be conducted jointly by IDA and the Government in November 1999. Details&#13;
of the Bank's supervision plan and of the annual and mid-term reviews, are provided in Annex 9.&#13;
The results of the mid-term review will be incorporated in an action plan, acceptable to IDA, for&#13;
further implementation of the project. In addition, the Government will, within six months of the&#13;
Credit closing, submit an implementation completion report (ICR), in accordance with the&#13;
guidelines for the preparation of a completion report applicable at that time. During&#13;
negotiations, the Government gave assurance to this effect (para. 6.2 (a)).&#13;

D. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.6     Table 4.1 summarizes the project cost by disbursement category and proposed&#13;
procurement method. A detailed procurement plan and timetable are given in Annex 10.&#13;
Procurement and decision-making will follow the World Bank's official guidelines on&#13;
procurement of works and goods (Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January&#13;
1995, Revised January andAugust 1996), and services (Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997) in all respects. Senegal's procurement&#13;
laws and regulations conform to IDA procurement guidelines. No special exemptions, permits,&#13;
or licenses need to be specified in Credit documents for international competitive bidding (ICB),&#13;
as Senegal's procurement regulations allow IDA procedures to take precedence over any&#13;
contrary provisions in local regulations.&#13;
4.7     Civil Works. The civil works program financed by IDA (US$1.5 million) concerns the&#13;
rehabilitation of an existing state-owned building to accommodate offices for DHSP, the DAGE&#13;
and MSPAS cabinet at the central level, and the rehabilitation of regional offices as well as the&#13;
construction of one staff house for each of the 9 SGE regional medical officers. Civil works will&#13;
be grouped into packages of at least US$500,000 each and procured through ICB in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995&#13;
revised 1996). Standard bidding documents developed by the Bank will be used. Civil works&#13;
contracts financed under the credit for contracts not exceeding US$500,000 will be awarded&#13;
through NCB procedures up to an aggregate amount of US$1.2 million. Due to spread and high&#13;
transportation costs, these civil works contracts are unlikely to attract foreign or large firns that&#13;
use modem equipment. Foreign bidders, however, would not be precluded from submitting bids.&#13;
Civil works contract management will be delegated to AGETIP, an autonomous local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
construction management entity closely supervised by Bank staff and auditors under another&#13;
IDA-financed project, whose efficiency has been proven in this area since 1992.&#13;
4.8    Goods. Goods financed under the credit (US$4.1 million) include: (a) drugs, laboratory&#13;
supplies and consumable chemicals; and (b) office equipment and supplies, office furniture for&#13;
the DHSP and DAGE, and vehicles for the SNGE central unit and project coordination.&#13;
Procurement of drugs, laboratory supplies and consumable chemicals will be procured through&#13;
Limited International Bidding (LIB) up to an aggregate amount of US$1 million because&#13;
contracts values will be small and quality requirements with regard to the products and their&#13;
delivery are important factors. Other goods will be grouped into packages of at least&#13;
US$100,000 each and procured through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised 1996). Standard&#13;
bidding documents developed by the Bank will be used. A preferential margin of 15 percent or&#13;
the applicable customs duty, whichever is less, over the c.i.f. prices of competing goods for all&#13;
ICB procurement will be given to domestic firms in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.&#13;
Contracts for goods not exceeding US$100,000 will be awarded through NCB procedures up to&#13;
an aggregate amount of US$200,000. Small quantities of goods such as office supplies and&#13;
equipment, vehicles, consumable materials and spare parts, which are available off-the-shelf and&#13;
cannot be grouped into bidding packages of at least US$50,000 may be procured through prudent&#13;
international shopping for an aggregate amount of US$90,000 and national shopping for an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$ 100,000, based on price quotations of at least three reliable suppliers.&#13;
All bids will be submitted on a c.i.f. basis for imported goods and on ex-factory basis for locally&#13;
manufactured goods.&#13;
4.9    Consultant Services. The project does not provide for long-term resident technical&#13;
assistance. International and local consultants providing specialist services financed by IDA&#13;
(US$4.0 million) would be contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelinesfor the Selection&#13;
and Employment of Consultants (January 1997). Selection of consultants will be addressed&#13;
through competition among qualified short-listed firms in which the selection will be based both&#13;
on the quality of the proposal and on the cost of the services to be provided except for audits of a&#13;
standard- nature which will use the least-cost selection. Short-lists for contracts estimated under&#13;
US$200,000 may be comprised entirely of national consultants if a sufficient number of&#13;
qualified firms (at least three) are available at competitive costs. However, if foreign firms have&#13;
expressed interest, they will not be excluded from consideration. The standard Letter of&#13;
Invitation and Form of Contract as developed by the Bank will be used for appointment of&#13;
consultants. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term assignments, i.e. those not&#13;
exceeding six months, carried out by individual consultants. The Government will be briefed&#13;
during negotiations about the special features of the new guidelines, in particular with regards to&#13;
advertisement, requirements for short lists and specific notice in the United Nations&#13;
Development Business (UNDB) publication for contract above US$200,000, and public bid&#13;
opening. Services to be contracted include technical consultants, training, contract management&#13;
services for building rehabilitation, and auditing and assistance in the area of accounting and&#13;
procurement. Contract management for the development of the Health Management Information&#13;
System (SIG) will be contracted on a single-source selection basis to Mazars &amp; Guerard for&#13;
continuity purpose since the firm has designed the system to the satisfaction of Government and&#13;
the donors during project preparation. Construction management will be delegated to AGETIP&#13;
using the standard contract developed by the Africa Region for AGETIP-type agencies acting as&#13;
a contract management agency. AGETIP will recruit the necessary consultants' services for&#13;
design and supervision in accordance with procedures described in its manual of procedures&#13;
which are consistent with Bank's procurement Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
4.10   Review by IDA. IDA-financed contracts above the threshold value of US$500,00 and of&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent for works and goods respectively will be subject to IDA's prior review&#13;
procedures. The review process would cover 80 percent of the total value of the amount&#13;
contracted for goods and 56 percent of the amount contracted for civil works. Selective post-&#13;
review of contracts awarded below the threshold levels will apply to about one in three contracts.&#13;
Draft standard bidding documents for NCB will be reviewed by and agreed upon with IDA. The&#13;
Bank will review the selection process for the hiring of consultants proposed by the Borrower.&#13;
The Borrower will be reminded that opening of the financial envelopes will not take place before&#13;
receiving the Bank's no-objection to the technical evaluation. Prior IDA review will not apply to&#13;
contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent respectively. However, the exception to prior IDA&#13;
review will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless of value, to single-&#13;
source hiring, to assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA or to amendments of&#13;
contracts raising the contract value above the prior review threshold.&#13;
4.11   Procurement Status and Proposed Arrangements. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government submitted to IDA, discussed and finalized the following documents: (a)&#13;
procurement plan; (b) Operational Manual for Project Management and Implementation; and&#13;
(c) bidding documents for the civil works and major equipment, as well as letters of invitation&#13;
for consultants services, financed by IDA (para. 6.1 (d)). During negotiations, the Government&#13;
gave assurance that it would apply the procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in&#13;
the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for ICB, NCB, and in the operational manual (para. 6.2&#13;
(b)).&#13;
4.12   Disbursements. The project is expected to be completed over a five-year period, with&#13;
the IDA Credit disbursed over six years, according to the categories shown in Table 4.2 below.&#13;
The estimated disbursement profile is shown in Annex 11. Disbursement of the Credit will be&#13;
fully documented, except for expenditures for works and goods under contracts costing less than&#13;
US$500,000 and US$100,000 respectively, and services under contracts with consulting firms&#13;
not exceeding US$100,000, and with individual consultants not exceeding US$50,000, which&#13;
would be made against Statements of Expenditure. Documentation for withdrawals under&#13;
Statement of Expenses would be retained for review by IDA supervision missions and for audits.&#13;

4.13   Special Account. To facilitate disbursements, the Government will open a Special&#13;
Account (SA) in a commercial bank in Dakar to cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures,&#13;
managed by the DSPH. The authorized allocation for the SA would be US$1 million equivalent.&#13;
IDA will make an initial deposit of US$600,000 equivalent into the SA upon Credit effectiveness&#13;
and will replenish the SA upon receipt of satisfactory proof of incurred eligible expenditures.&#13;
Replenishment will be accompanied by up-to-date bank statements and reconciliation of the SA.&#13;
To expedite the implementation of day-to-day activities and effect small payments for local&#13;
training programs involving frequent expenditures in local currency at the district level, Medical&#13;
Regions will be provided from the special account with petty cash equivalent to two months of&#13;
expenditures to be incurred in carrying out the activities planned and agreed upon between the&#13;
Medical Region and the DSPH. Justifications of the use of cash, together with the request for&#13;
replenishment if necessary, will be prepared monthly by the Medical Region Administration&#13;
accountant. All documentation regarding the use of the funds by the Medical Region&#13;
Administration accountant will be kept at the level of the Medical Region for supervision&#13;
missions and audits. Medical Regions will open accounts operated by the accountant of the&#13;
Medical Region Administration under the supervision of the Regional Medical Officer. The&#13;
Medical Region Administration accountant is a staff member qualified in accounting and&#13;
administrative procedures and is subject to regular government monitoring and scrutiny. Each&#13;
district medical officer will be responsible for establishing an annual budget for the activities to&#13;
be carried out, and the Medical Region Administration accountant would regularly provide the&#13;
necessary funds on the basis of justification established with the assistance of the district&#13;
administrative accountant. Justifications of expenditure eligibility will be handed over to the&#13;
project accountant and kept as supporting documents for the use of the Statement of&#13;
Expenditures procedure.&#13;
4.14   A detailed proposal on the accounting system and procedures to be followed, as well as a&#13;
profile of personnel needed and equipment required, would be prepared by consultants. During&#13;
negotiations the Government furnished the terms of reference for the consultants to be recruited&#13;
to establish the accounting andfinancial management system of the project, the terms of&#13;
reference, the short list offirms and the selection procedures for audit contracts, to be reviewed&#13;
by IDA and agreed upon (para. 6.1 (e)). As a condition for Credit effectiveness, the Government&#13;
will establish afinancial management and accounting system for the project, acceptable to IDA&#13;
(para. 6.3 (b)). The DHSP Deputy-Director would at all times keep project financial records in&#13;
accordance with sound internal accounting practices to reflect project operations and financial&#13;
position. These records would be made available to visiting Bank missions and independent&#13;
auditors. The project accounts, including the SA, will be audited annually, in accordance with&#13;
International Standard of Auditing, by independent external auditors acceptable to IDA. The&#13;
audited accounts and the auditor's report, including the Management Letter (Long Form) and a&#13;
statement as to whether or not IDA funds had been used for their intended purpose, and a&#13;
separate opinion with respect to statement of expenditures and the Special Account would be&#13;
submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year for the Project. Assurances to&#13;
this effect were reached at negotiations (para. 6.2 (c)). As a condition for Credit effectiveness,&#13;
the Government will sign a multi-year contract awardfor auditing the Project accounts,&#13;
acceptable to the Association (para. 6.3 (e)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
5. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
5.1    Project Benefits. By reducing the burden of malaria, schistosomiasis and&#13;
onchocerciasis, the project will directly benefit the rural populations where these diseases are&#13;
most prevalent. As a result of the reinforcement of national capacities to control endemic and&#13;
epidemic diseases, the project will also significantly benefit people in poor urban areas who have&#13;
been severely hit by recent epidemics of cholera, and who are still at high risk from other&#13;
epidemics such as cerebral meningitis.&#13;
5.2    The social and economic development of the entire Senegalese population will strongly&#13;
benefit from the success of the project as endemic disease control activities are pure public&#13;
goods with important externalities. All activities have been proven to have a high cost-&#13;
effectiveness (less than US$50 per DALYs) and an important economic retum. Based on the&#13;
sub-regional average cost of a case of malaria, the burden of malaria in Senegal represents one&#13;
percent of GDP, i.e. around US$6 million in 1995. The project's global objective to reduce&#13;
malaria morbidity by 20 percent would save an equivalent of 0.2 percent of GDP.&#13;
5.3   Finally, the implementation of a computerized network supporting the national health&#13;
information system would: (a) help decision-makers to better program and rationalize the use of&#13;
resources allocated to the health sector, in particular through the achievement of the SIP's&#13;
objectives, currently under preparation; (b) develop the connectivity not only between health&#13;
staff with the electronic mail, but also with intemational partners with a possible link to the&#13;
intemet network; and (c) create within the MSPAS a new work culture towards partnership and&#13;
cross-fertilization with external actors.&#13;
5.4    Project Risks. The first risk relates to the integration of a reinforced SNGE within the&#13;
general health services, and its acceptance by the staff in general. This risk would be reduced&#13;
by: (a) a clear definition of the breakdown of responsibilities between the SNGE and the general&#13;
health services in the control of each of the endemic and epidemic diseases; (b) the SNGE's&#13;
demonstration of high professionalism and expertise in the area of infectious diseases; and (c)&#13;
the development of a strong team spirit.&#13;
5.5    The second risk relates to the non-sustainability of crucial activities at peripheral levels,&#13;
such as continuous in-service training, regular supervision of the staff, and education of the&#13;
population on public health issues. In recognition of this risk, the proposed SIP, would support&#13;
the development of Regional and District Health Plans which will include these activities and&#13;
ensure their budgetary allocations. Regional and district health teams would be accountable for&#13;
the implementation of these activities.&#13;
5.6    The last risk would be the failure of the donor community to fully coordinate its efforts&#13;
to support the surveillance and control of endemic and epidemic diseases. The Bank would&#13;
assist the Govemment in minimizing this potential risk during project implementation through&#13;
coordination mechanisms, to be established under both this project and the SIP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND&#13;
RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1    During negotiations, the Government furnished the following documents:&#13;
(a)   the Letter of Sub-Sector Policy, including the project monitoring indicators&#13;
(para. 3.1);&#13;
(b)   the document showing that the building to be rehabilitated is state-owned and&#13;
has officially been earmarked for the MSPAS (para. 3.36);&#13;
(c)   the appointment of the Deputy-Director of the DHSP as the project director, and&#13;
the appointment of the project manager and DHSP accountant, whose&#13;
qualifications and terms of reference are satisfactory for IDA (para. 4.3);&#13;
(d)   the procurement plan, the Operational Manual for Project Management and&#13;
Implementation, and the bidding document for the civil works and major&#13;
equipment, as well as the letters of invitation for consultants services, financed&#13;
by IDA (para. 4.1 1); and&#13;
(e)   the terms of reference for the consultants to be recruited to establish the&#13;
accounting and financial management system of the project; and (ii) the terms of&#13;
reference, the short list of firms and the selection procedures for audit contracts&#13;
(para. 4.14).&#13;
6.2    During negotiations, the Government gave assurance that it would:&#13;
(a)   submit an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) within six months of the&#13;
Credit closing (para. 4.5);&#13;
(b)   apply the procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents for ICB, NCB, and in the operational manual&#13;
(para. 4.11); and&#13;
(c)   submit to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year, audited accounts&#13;
and the auditor's report, including the Management Letter (Long Form) and a&#13;
statement as to whether or not IDA funds had been used for their intended&#13;
purpose, and a separate opinion with respect to statement of expenditures and the&#13;
Special Account (para 4.14).&#13;
6.3    As conditions for Credit effectiveness, the Government will:&#13;
(a)   adopt the new organizational and administrative structure of the Endemic&#13;
Disease sub-Directorate acceptable to IDA (para. 3.33);&#13;
(b)   establish a financial management and accounting system for the project,&#13;
acceptable to IDA (para. 4.14); and&#13;
(c)   sign a multi-year contract award for auditing the Project accounts, acceptable to&#13;
the Association (para. 4.14).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
6.4    Recommendation. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would be suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR10.8 million (US$14.9 million equivalent) to the&#13;
Republic of Senegal on standard IDA termns.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL&#13;
ENDEMIC DISEASE CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
SUB-SECTOR POLICY LETTER&#13;
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn&#13;
President, World Bank&#13;
1818 H Street N.W.&#13;
Washington, D.C. 20433&#13;
Dear Mr. President&#13;
i .    I have the honor, in connection with the negotiations now under way with your&#13;
institution concerning the Endemic Diseases Control Project, to be carried out within the&#13;
framework of the Nouvelles Orientations de la Politique de Sante et d'Action Sociale, to send&#13;
you the following letter on behalf of the Head of State and Government of Senegal.&#13;
2     While the health of a country's population at any given time is largely determined by that&#13;
country's current level of development, health is also a decisive factor in determining future&#13;
growth, particularly when, as in Senegal's case, that growth rests upon the development of&#13;
human resources. This same health-development nexus underlies all the international&#13;
recommendations to which Senegal has subscribed since adopting the Primary Health Care&#13;
Strategy at Alma-Ata in 1978. Even before the Alma-Ata conference, indeed from the early days&#13;
of independence, Senegal has been implementing a basic health care policy, which was&#13;
strengthened in 1972 by a reform based on decentralization and community participation, with&#13;
the additional element of regionalization.&#13;
3.    Regrettably, after two decades (1960-1980) of growth, and of considerable improvement&#13;
in the national health indicators, Senegal found itself faced in the nineteen-eighties with an&#13;
economic crisis and a severe tightening on the volume of resources allocated to the social&#13;
sectors. This lack of resources led to a qualitative and quantitative decline in the services&#13;
provided in those sectors, and a deterioration in the living conditions of the vulnerable&#13;
population cohorts, specifically, the rural communities, low-income urban households, and&#13;
women. Moreover, Senegal's heavy population growth was resulting in increasingly heavy&#13;
pressure on the demand for health services; a demand the country's health system was simply&#13;
unable to meet.&#13;
4.    It was within this context, which, while fraught with difficulties, proved conducive to&#13;
debate and to change, that the Head of State, following the country's tradition of viewing the&#13;
development of human resources as the key to growth, approved the Population Policy Statement&#13;
in April 1988, as well as the Health Policy Statement in June 1989. The basic objective was to&#13;
improve the standards of living and well-being of the population by achieving a better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
quantitative and qualitative balance between supply and demand in the areas of health,&#13;
education, and employment.&#13;
5.    In August 1991, the Health and Social Action Sector Policy Letter was adopted, serving&#13;
as a framework for the Human Resources Development Project (PDRH 1) supported financially&#13;
by IDA. The objectives of the National Health Policy were to: (a) improve health coverage,&#13;
particularly in rural and peripheral urban areas; (b) improve maternal and child health; (c)&#13;
develop preventive and educational activities; (d) rationalize curative care; (e) rationalize and&#13;
develop the utilization of human, material, and financial resources; and (f) keep check on&#13;
democratic variables.&#13;
6.    In 1995, based on the results obtained, medium- and long-term guidelines, as well as&#13;
priority spheres of action for the Ministry of Public Health and Social Action (MSPAS) and for&#13;
the development partners were defined. These consisted of: (a) rationalization of human&#13;
resource utilization through the development of personnel hiring, training, and redeployment&#13;
policies; (b) improvements in health and social action services, focusing in particular on&#13;
infectious disease control, establishment of an information system, and actions to inform and&#13;
educate the communities; (c) development of a national pharmaceutical policy; and (d)&#13;
redefinition of the role to be played, particularly on the financial scene, by the various actors in&#13;
the health field, namely the Government, the communities, the local authorities, and the&#13;
development partners.&#13;
7.     The present statement clarifies those guidelines as they relate to the control of endemic&#13;
and potentially epidemic diseases. They are set out under three main headings: (a) the evolution&#13;
of the health situation; (b) the key issues in the control of endemic and epidemic diseases; and&#13;
(c) the Government's medium- and long-term objectives.&#13;
1.     THE EVOLUTION OF THE HEALTH SITUATION&#13;
1.1    Evolution of Health service Supply&#13;
1.1.1  Historical Overview&#13;
8.    A legacy of the colonial era, the control of endemic and potentially epidemic diseases&#13;
has continued to be the territory of the National Endemic Disease Service [Service National des&#13;
Grandes Endcmies - SNGE] and of its regional units, the Secteurs des Grandes Endcmies&#13;
(SGEs). Despite some attempts to achieve administrative decentralization and integration in&#13;
peripheral health services, the SNGE remains profoundly independent and centralized. The&#13;
economic crisis of the last fifteen years has revealed the disastrous consequences of the SNGE's&#13;
failure to evolve: it has practically no resources left of its own and is dependent upon external&#13;
support.&#13;
1.1.2 Organization and Operation of the Present System&#13;
9.     The National Endemic Disease Service is one of three national services operated by the&#13;
Directorate of Hygiene and Public Health [Direction de l'Hygiene et de la Sante Publique -&#13;
DHSP]. It comprises a central unit, the Service Central des Grandes Endemies, and the nine&#13;
regional Secteurs (SGEs). At the regional level, the SGEs come under the administrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
authority of the Medical Regions. The DHSP also includes seven Divisions, including the&#13;
Statistical Division, which is responsible for the health information system -- Systeme&#13;
d'Information a des fins de Gestion (SIG).&#13;
10.    SNGE's operating budget is extremely tight and does not cover its recurrent&#13;
expenditures. Its activities are virtually restricted to those financed by the donors within the&#13;
framework of the National Disease Control Programs, targeting specific diseases such as&#13;
malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, dracunculosis, onchocerciasis, and diseases covered by the&#13;
Expanded Program of Immunization [Programme Elargi de Vaccination - PEV]. Each program&#13;
is managed independently, with its own logistical and material resources.&#13;
II.   SNGE's central unit has few employees. In addition to the unit's director [Directeur du&#13;
Service], there are five physicians and three senior health technicians, with each responsible for&#13;
one of the national programs. Although they all belong to the same service, each member of the&#13;
team works completely independently of the others. Compounding this isolation is the fact that,&#13;
for lack of space at the DHSP, the programs are all housed in different locations scattered&#13;
throughout the city of Dakar.&#13;
12.   At the regional level, only four of the ten existing SGEs are headed by a physician&#13;
(Kaolack, Thies, St. Louis and Ziguinchor). The staff of the SGEs chiefly comprises health&#13;
"agents," or technicians, who are attached to one of the national programs. The number of&#13;
agents attached to a program depends on the extent of that program's funding. In practice,&#13;
staffers are attached either to leprosy control programs, onchocerciasis control programs, or the&#13;
PEV. The total number of agents in the SGEs varies from two in the Diourbel region to twenty-&#13;
one in the Tambacounda region, where the onchocerciasis program alone has a staff of ten.&#13;
13.   Although administratively dependent on the Medical Regions, the offices of the SGEs,&#13;
except for those of Fatick and Diourbel, are not located at the headquarters of the Medical&#13;
Regions but scattered among different cities, making it all the more difficult for their staffs to&#13;
communicate or exchange information.&#13;
1.2    Evolution of Demand&#13;
14.   Three key elements have influenced the general state of health of the Senegalese&#13;
population: (i) an overburdened and highly varied epidemiological picture; (ii) the high fertility&#13;
levels, which represent a serious threat to maternal and child health; and (iii) the persistently&#13;
dubious conditions of public hygiene and pervasive malnutrition.&#13;
1.2.1 An Over-burdened Epidemiological Picture&#13;
15.   An analysis of the epidemiological situation demonstrates the persistence, or even the&#13;
recrudescence, of the major tropical endemic diseases, sexually transmissible diseases,&#13;
tuberculosis, and childhood diseases. This picture is compounded by recent threats of epidemics&#13;
of diseases such as cholera or cerebro-spinal meningitis, and the appearance of new endemic&#13;
diseases such as AIDS.&#13;
16.   Overall, mortality rates have declined substantially over the past 30 years, falling from&#13;
26 per million to 18 per million in 1995. Nevertheless, child and maternal mortality rates are&#13;
still too high, respectively 68 per million and 5 10 per 100,000 live births.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
17.   In Senegal, the chief causes of death in children of 0-5 years are diarrheal diseases,&#13;
respiratory diseases, and malaria. These three pathologies are also the chief causes of morbidity,&#13;
malaria being the principal motivation for a medical consultation.&#13;
1.2.2 High Fertility Levels&#13;
18.    The overall fertility level is high, with a gross birth rate of 47 per million, and a synthetic&#13;
measure of fertility of 6.0 per woman. This high fertility level, remaining more or less stable&#13;
over the period 1978-1995, has resulted a very young population: over 45% of the country's&#13;
population is under 15 years of age.&#13;
1.2.3 Inadequate Hygiene and Malnutrition&#13;
19.    Rapid urban development, as well as inadequately monitored flight from the land, has&#13;
led to the establishment of housing settlements where there is little respect for the basic rules of&#13;
public and domestic hygiene. The shantytowns and squatter settlements that have sprung up&#13;
both on the urban peripheries and in the inner cities are all foci of epidemic diseases. The lower&#13;
income level of their occupants is yet another factor contributing to the often appalling health&#13;
conditions found in these areas, resulting in veritable breeding grounds for all types of socio-&#13;
health scourges, such as childhood diseases, malaria, schistosomiasis, cholera, sexually&#13;
transmissible diseases, malnutrition, etc.&#13;
II.    THE KEY ISSUES IN THE CONTROL OF ENDEMIC AND EPIDEMIC DISEASES&#13;
20.    The epidemiological situation continues to be dominated by infectious diseases and&#13;
represents a major challenge for any health policy. Despite this, national capacities for&#13;
combating these diseases have gradually diminished over the past twenty years as SNGE's&#13;
organization and operation have deteriorated.&#13;
2.1    Organizational Dysfunctions&#13;
21.    The serious dysfunctions affecting the system's organization cannot fail to have an&#13;
adverse impact on its results and performance.&#13;
2.1.1  Dysfunctions on theActivities Side&#13;
22.    For lack of the necessary resources, a large number of endemic and epidemic diseases&#13;
are subject to virtually no surveillance or control. SNGE's activities in the area of endemic&#13;
disease control are restricted to diseases targeted by the national programs and financed by a&#13;
development partner.&#13;
23.    The epidemiological surveillance system is extremely rudimentary and consists mainly&#13;
of passive surveillance based on the activities reports submitted by the health services. There is&#13;
no epidemic alert system, and, with a few exceptions, no active epidemiological surveillance.&#13;
24.    There is no systematic feedback for the health workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
25.   In the area of control, specific activities have been defined for a few diseases such as&#13;
tuberculosis, malaria, dracunculosis, and leprosy. However, these activities are rarely linked to a&#13;
monitoring indicator. There are no specific control programs for any of the potentially epidemic&#13;
diseases.&#13;
26.   In the case of the SGEs, regular activities, apart from those connected with the PEV,&#13;
commonly take the form of general medical consultations. With the substantial decline in the&#13;
leprosy prevalence rate, the activities of the national leprosy control program have been scaled&#13;
down. The few activities relating to the surveillance and control of other endemic and&#13;
potentially epidemic diseases still occur only very sporadically, and without any form of&#13;
planning.&#13;
2.1.2 Staffing Dysfunctions&#13;
27.   Administratively speaking, SNGE's employees all belong to the same government&#13;
department. In practice, however, they belong first and foremost to the national disease control&#13;
programs. Their training and retraining, and sometimes their career path itself, are covered&#13;
exclusively by the national program to which they belong. Their benefits and pay are linked to&#13;
those programs.&#13;
28.    The fact that there are practically no inter-program staff transfers adds to the lack of&#13;
rationalization in staff utilization. For example, although the activities of the leprosy control&#13;
program have been scaled down in view of the program's success, members of the program's&#13;
team have not received other assignments and are substantially under-employed. At the same&#13;
time, the tuberculosis control program has no staff specifically assigned to it in the SGEs, and&#13;
can thus perform only a limited range of activities.&#13;
29.    The disparities in health service delivery are heightened by the uneven distribution of&#13;
personnel among the SGEs, Diourbel, for instance, having two workers and Tambacounda&#13;
twenty-two.&#13;
2.1.3 Dysfunctions in Terms of Workspace&#13;
30.    The DHSP is located in a tumble-down building that cannot house all of its Services and&#13;
Divisions. What little equipment it has is often out of service. The SGEs operate in extremely&#13;
old, if not virtually uninhabitable, premises and suffer from a lack of equipment and logistic&#13;
facilities. In most cases, their premises are a long way away from the Medical Regions,&#13;
compounding the lack of rationalization in the use of equipment, communications equipment in&#13;
particular, and of logistic facilities.&#13;
2.2    Operational Disorders&#13;
31.    The decision to subdivide SNGE's organization and operations into different programs has&#13;
considerably weakened the potential for strengthening institutional capacities in the field of control&#13;
of endemic and potentially epidemic diseases. This negative impact has been particularly&#13;
detrimental to the control of "old" endemic diseases such as malaria. For example, the expertise&#13;
and practical skills acquired by SNGE in the areas of entomology and epidemiology during the&#13;
malaria eradication campaigns of the sixties have virtually disappeared.&#13;
&#13;

m      THE OBJECTIVES IN THE SUB-SECTOR&#13;
32.    To address all the constraints and issues identified in the area of endemic and epidemic&#13;
diseases, the Govemment intends to focus on national capacity building in the area of infectious&#13;
disease control, with the aim of seeking a better quantitative and qualitative balance between&#13;
service delivery and the essential needs of the communities. Its strategy will be based on a&#13;
cohesive set of actions geared to redefinition of SNGE's mission, reorganization and&#13;
decentralization of MSPAS, and efforts to improve demand and supply.&#13;
3.1    SNGE's Mission&#13;
33.    SNGE's mission is to organize and coordinate the surveillance, prevention, as well as the&#13;
control of endemic and potentially epidemic diseases and of infectious diseases detrimental to&#13;
public health.&#13;
34.    This mission falls within the framework of the decentralization of health services and the&#13;
redefinition of the role of MSPAS' central services, and is restricted to the design of policies and&#13;
strategies, and the contracting-out of the actual implementation of those same strategies.&#13;
3.2    SNGE's Organizational Chart&#13;
35.    To enable SNGE to accomplish its objectives, a reform will be initiated within the&#13;
general framework of the MSPAS reorganization. The pertinent legislation should receive final&#13;
approval during 1997.&#13;
36.    The philosophy of SNGE's reorganization falls within the framework of decentralization&#13;
of the health services and is geared to greater rationalization in the utilization of human,&#13;
logistical, physical, and financial resources, as well as to the provision of better quality and more&#13;
evenly distributed services.&#13;
37.    At the central level, SNGE will be expected to concentrate on the design of surveillance&#13;
and control strategies to combat endemic and potentially epidemic diseases, definition of&#13;
objectives and monitoring indicators, and supervision of the SGEs' performance in implementing&#13;
the Regional Health Plans. The central unit will also enter into all necessary contracts for&#13;
disease control activities, either with the regions, within the framework of the Regional Health&#13;
Plans, or with other govemment, parastatal, or private agencies, both for profit and non-profit.&#13;
38.    The work of the central unit will be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team headed by a&#13;
Chef de Service. Task allocation within the unit will be based on team spirit and flexibility.&#13;
39.    At the regional level, the SGEs will conform to the guiding principles and policies laid&#13;
down at the central level. Within this framework, the SGEs will be responsible for adapting the&#13;
endemic and epidemic disease control strategies to local constraints, and for implementing those&#13;
strategies, which they will incorporate into activity plans specifying objectives, activities, costs,&#13;
and sources of financing.&#13;
40.    The SGEs will submit annual performance reports, and while it is on these reports that&#13;
their evaluation will primarily depend, account will also be taken of the degree of satisfaction&#13;
expressed by the regional medical teams and district teams they support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
41.   As at the central level, the dominant characteristics required of SGE personnel will be&#13;
flexibility and demonstration of team spirit.&#13;
3.3    Actions in the Areas of Demand and Supply&#13;
42.   In the area of demand, the focus will be on actions to inform and educate the different&#13;
population cohorts, in particular mothers, pregnant women, and school children. Steps will also&#13;
be taken to obtain a better knowledge of their demand for services, so that this information may&#13;
rapidly be used to guide, if not actually drive, supply.&#13;
43.    On the health service supply side, actions in the area of surveillance and control of&#13;
endemic and epidemic diseases will focus on making better use of existing resources by&#13;
improving the distribution of personnel and the allocation of available resources, and by&#13;
enhancing the services' cost-efficiency ratios (internal efficiency). New linkages will be forged&#13;
with non-governmental entities so as to increase the participation of civil society, and establish a&#13;
cohesive nationwide health system based on both the public and private supply of health&#13;
services.&#13;
44.   The specific goals the Government aims to achieve over the medium term in order to&#13;
accomplish this general objective are:&#13;
(a)    a reduction of morbidity and mortality rates linked to malaria, schistosomiasis,&#13;
and onchocerciasis;&#13;
(b)    a greater efficiency of health system performance in the control of endemic and&#13;
epidemic diseases;&#13;
(c)    improvements in health care utilization; and&#13;
(d)    an improved quality of health services.&#13;
45.    The strategies for achieving this overall package of objectives are:&#13;
(a)    an improvement and rationalization of activities to control malaria,&#13;
schistosomiasis, and onchocerciasis, thereby paving the way for those activities&#13;
to be extended to other endemic and epidemic diseases;&#13;
(b)    a development of the review and computerization of the SIG to make this into a&#13;
flexible and efficient system of communication which can provide rapid&#13;
feedback to the health workers; and&#13;
(c)    a capacity building at SNGE and the SGEs.&#13;
IV.   CONCLUSION&#13;
46.    I take this opportunity to reiterate the Government of Senegal's commitment to the&#13;
program described in the present health policy letter. It is the Government's firm conviction that&#13;
this program will help to bring about a substantial improvement in the development of Senegal's&#13;
health and social sectors.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL&#13;
ENDEMIC DISEASE CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
MALARIA&#13;
I.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Both the study and control of malaria has a long history in Senegal, at least since the mid-&#13;
19th century but, as in all other countries of tropical Africa, the disproportion between the meager&#13;
resources available and the magnitude of the problem, has not permitted important and durable&#13;
impact on the epidemiological situation. Malaria continues to be the main cause of morbidity and&#13;
mortality, representing between 40 and 50% of all consultations.&#13;
A. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND&#13;
2.    The use of quinine for individual prophylaxis was introduced in Senegal by the mid-19th&#13;
century, and limited efforts of environmental sanitation and larviciding were undertaken in Saint&#13;
Louis and Dakar during the first half of the XX century. The introduction of DDT, after World&#13;
War II, led to the establishment of a national anti-malaria service (Service de Lutte&#13;
Antipaludique, SLAP) in 1952, with the collaboration of WHO and UNICEF, starting a Malaria&#13;
Control Pilot Project in the Thies region. The failure to interrupt malaria transmission with only&#13;
insecticide spraying, led te the introduction of mass chemoprophylaxis in 1957, on a pilot project&#13;
scale comparing chloroqu,ne and pyrimethamine.&#13;
3.    In 1961, the recognition by WHO that malaria eradication could not be sustained in the&#13;
absence of solid general health services resulted in the progressive transformation of malaria&#13;
control programs into so-called Pre-eradication Programs aimed at the development of basic&#13;
health services and, therefore, to the abandonment of specific malaria control activities&#13;
throughout tropical Africa.&#13;
4.    Malaria chemoprophylaxis for the protection of children under 5 years of age continued&#13;
to be promoted, but coverage was always irregular and never achieved the level required to&#13;
control malaria morbidity, although it undoubtedly contributed to the general availability of&#13;
chloroquine and, therefore, to the decline of malaria mortality. Since the mid-1980's, mass&#13;
chemoprophylaxis of children has been discouraged by WHO because of its selection pressure&#13;
for drug resistant parasites.&#13;
5.    Vector control activities, no longer demanded as a basic component of the malaria&#13;
control strategy, and in 1981 became the responsibility of a newly-created militarized Hygiene&#13;
Service, which attempted to undertake and coordinate larviciding and spraying activities, limited&#13;
in most cases to point actions based on empirical considerations, such as complaints of mosquito&#13;
nuisance or stagnant water. An evaluation of their activities, carried out in April 1996, indicated&#13;
severe insufficiencies in material and human resources, leading to a lack of technical guidance in&#13;
the field, and a failure to evaluate activities and results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
Annex 3&#13;

B. RATIONALE FOR INTERVENTION&#13;
6.    The successive failure in Senegal, as in most tropical countries, of the different attempts&#13;
to achieve sustainable interruption of transmission, and the final elimination of the disease,&#13;
created a feeling of disappointment about malaria, and did not allow the focusing of attention on&#13;
the possibilities to alleviate the burden of the disease. Meanwhile, malaria continued claiming&#13;
lives throughout the tropics, its toll of death and incapacity remaining a major obstacle to&#13;
socioeconomic development, and demanding ever more costly treatment, as parasite resistance&#13;
continued to spread.&#13;
7.    Between 1990 and 1992, WHO, with the assistance of most international development&#13;
agencies, coordinated the development of regional malaria control strategies, culminating with&#13;
the adoption of a global strategy at the Ministerial Conference on Malaria Control in&#13;
Amsterdam in October 1992. This strategy gives the highest priority to the prevention of death&#13;
and the reduction of incapacity by making appropriate case management accessible where ever&#13;
necessary, through the development of primary health care and health information, through the&#13;
education of the population, and concentrating vector control wherever it can achieve sustainable&#13;
results. The strategy also gives a high priority to the development of an epidemiological&#13;
information system, to early detection and control, and, if possible, to the prevention of&#13;
epidemics.&#13;
8.    Conscious of the importance of the malaria problem, the Government of Senegal, in its&#13;
Declaration of National Health Policy of June 1989, had made malaria control one of the highest&#13;
priorities of its health policy. Senegal was an active participant in the Ministerial Conference&#13;
and co-signatory of the declaration of Amsterdam in October 1992. The political will to pursue&#13;
this goal, according to the global malaria control strategy, has been shown by the formulation of&#13;
a National Program for Malaria Control (1996-2000), issued in Dakar in August 1995.&#13;
II.    SITUATION ANALYSIS&#13;
A. VECTOR DISTRIBUTION AND ECOLOGY&#13;
9.    Within the last twenty years, twelve Anopheles species have been found in Senegal,&#13;
either biting man or resting in human dwellings; by far the most important vectors are the two&#13;
main members of the A. gambiae complex, A. gambiae s.s. and A. arabiensis; A. funestus is&#13;
mainly limited to the South; A. melas, a third member of the A. gambiae complex, is limited to&#13;
the coastal areas, and A. pharoensis may play a very limited role in transmission in the Senegal&#13;
delta.&#13;
B. EPIDEMIOLOGY&#13;
10.   Epidemiological Patterns. The great ecological diversity in Senegal is reflected in a&#13;
similar diversity in malaria epidemiology. A general stratification has been made into two main&#13;
epidemiological patterns (facies epidemiologiques):&#13;
(a)    sahelian malaria with a short transmission season, generally less than 4 months.&#13;
The main vector is A. arabiensis with A. gambiae and/or A. funestus, as occasional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 18&#13;
vectors in some places. It corresponds to the Saloumian, Ferlian, and Capvertian&#13;
geographical regions;&#13;
(b)   tropical malaria, with a long period of transmission, during the 4-6 months of the&#13;
rains and the beginning of the dry season. It corresponds to the region of Boundou&#13;
and the Basse Casamance, inland from the mangrove. The main vector is A.&#13;
gambiae s.s. with the addition, in some places, of A. arabiensis and/or A. funestus,&#13;
giving a high inoculation rate (&gt;100 infectious bites/man/year).&#13;
11.   Malaria transmission shows important seasonal fluctuations and generally increases from&#13;
North to South and from West to East, both in intensity and in the duration of the transmission&#13;
season. The two main patterns are modified by ecological variations and human activities, the&#13;
two most important being the general drought, which has affected most of the country since the&#13;
1970's, and urbanization which continues to increase. Irrigation projects in Sahelian areas have,&#13;
so far, not resulted in important changes in the pattern of malaria transmission, perhaps due to&#13;
their relatively small scale. There is, nevertheless, some anecdotal evidence that the&#13;
revitalization of the Ferlo valley and the Guiers lake are extending the transmission season in&#13;
this northern area.&#13;
12.    Therefore, thus far, only two focal patterns are important enough to deserve attention:&#13;
(a)    urban malaria, corresponding to the main urban areas, particularly the Dakar area;&#13;
in general, the intensity of transmission decreases from the periphery towards the&#13;
center of town, although, within the perimeter of the city, there are water collections&#13;
and even agricultural areas which may represent important foci of transmission, and&#13;
(b)    mangrove malaria, corresponding to the mangrove swamps on the deltas of the&#13;
main rivers Senegal, Saloum, and Casamance.&#13;
13.   Malaria Parasites. P. falciparum is by far the predominant species, representing over&#13;
97% of the infections detected throughout the country, mainly found alone, although, in between&#13;
one to four percent of the cases it has been found associated with P. malariae and P. ovale.&#13;
Parasite rates, found in general population surveys, varied from 3% in 1991 in the Senegal river&#13;
valley (Dagana &amp; Podor), to 28% (1979) in Diourbel region, 28-31% (1992 &amp; 1995) in&#13;
Tambacounda region, and over 60% (1986) in the Ziguinchor region, confirming the North South&#13;
gradient in the intensity of transmission.&#13;
14.   Morbidity and Mortality. As mentioned above, all health statistics place malaria as the&#13;
main cause of morbidity and mortality in the country. The statistical compilation made in 1995&#13;
for the preparation of the National Program of Malaria Control gave a proportional morbidity for&#13;
the whole country for 1993 of 35.3%, followed by diarrheal diseases with 12.2%, and intestinal&#13;
parasitoses with 10.9%. In urban areas, surveys carried out in October-November 1992, showed&#13;
that malaria represented 13.7% of all fevers in Dakar and 12.4% in Pikine; infections in adults&#13;
were as frequent (55.6%) as in children (44.1 %) in these areas.&#13;
15.   Mortality has been traditionally under-evaluated, particularly in rural areas. Data&#13;
collected in 1993 from health centers and health posts, gave a national case fatality rate of 0.1%,&#13;
and a rate of only 5.7% for neuropaludisme, which indicates obvious under-reporting .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 18&#13;
16.   In the Dakar area, hospital statistics show great variability in the epidemiological&#13;
indicators, with proportional morbidity in the range 1-3% for general services and 11% in the&#13;
department of infectious diseases. Case fatality is rather indicative of case selection, being in the&#13;
range of 4-8% in general services, 10.8% in the department of infectious diseases, and 32.9% in&#13;
the intensive care service of the Principal Hospital of Dakar.&#13;
17.   In spite of the paucity of available information, as well as the lack of continuity of&#13;
existing data, regional hospital statistics reflect the endemicity of the different areas.&#13;
Proportional morbidity, which in Thies remains similar to the Dakar area, reaches 5-12% in&#13;
Louga and well over 30% in Fatick, Kaolack and Tambacounda. The 1996 survey also showed&#13;
in hospital statistics the general intensification of malaria transmission in 1994-1995.&#13;
18.    Parasite Susceptibility to Anti-malarial Drugs. The first cases of resistance reported&#13;
from Senegal were infections with P. falciparum resistant to pyrimethamine, discovered in Thies&#13;
in 1961. Chloroquine resistance was found in vitro in 1985 in Kaolack. The first cases of P.&#13;
falciparum resistant in vivo were reported in Dakar and its suburbs in 1988. Since 1988, a&#13;
system of surveillance has been established in selected areas, with the collaboration of the&#13;
Faculty of Medicine and O.R.S.T.O.M.&#13;
III.   ISSUES&#13;
19.    As in other endemic countries, malaria control in Senegal suffers from the fact that the&#13;
realistic strategy now being adopted has much less spectacular objectives than the eradication&#13;
proposed in the past, and does not match the expectations of the general population. During the&#13;
past decade, efforts to change these perceptions have succeeded in convincing the authorities, but&#13;
have not penetrated to the educated general public who often view the new strategy as a&#13;
disappointing surrogate. There is therefore a need for intensifying the information and education&#13;
efforts on the perception of the malaria problem and the strategy of control. In the past, the&#13;
absence of a National Control Program and a coordinating mechanism for the different agencies&#13;
involved in malaria control also created some confusion about basic elements such as case&#13;
definitions and treatment, and laboratory practices.&#13;
20.    There are specific problems in each of the main areas of possible intervention: diagnosis&#13;
and treatment, chemoprophylaxis, selective vector control, epidemiological information system&#13;
and epidemic prevention or control.&#13;
A. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT&#13;
21.   It has traditionally been considered a purely medical problem, outside the scope of&#13;
public health. Nevertheless, inadequate case management of a disease as prevalent as malaria is&#13;
a major health problem, and making proper diagnosis and treatment accessible to the whole&#13;
population, both physically and socio-culturally, is one of the most useful and sustainable public&#13;
health activities, particularly when backed-up by an epidemiological information system capable&#13;
of guiding necessary adjustments. The development of a health infrastructure was the main&#13;
factor which contributed to the elimination of malaria from southern Europe and the U.S.A. and&#13;
was recognized, as early as 1961, as a prerequisite for the effectiveness of control programs&#13;
based on transmission control. In Senegal, current treatment practices are rather anarchic and, to&#13;
a certain degree, contribute to the deterioration of the malaria problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
Page 5 of 18&#13;
22.    Case Containment at the Community Level. Self-medication of fever is the normal&#13;
practice in rural areas, where it could be expected, as in other countries of West Africa, to be the&#13;
only therapeutic resource in around 80% of the cases. Even in Dakar, self-medication has been&#13;
recognized in 20% of the cases. Chloroquine is the drug most used and may be the only one&#13;
available in many rural markets. In Dakar, in 1992, quinine, amodiaquine and sulfadoxin/&#13;
pyrimethamine were also widely used in self-treatment, often several drugs at a time.&#13;
23.    Dosage, as in other countries, is generally inadequate, as knowledge about doses and&#13;
duration of treatment is almost always lacking, possible sources of information are unclear and&#13;
often contradictory, and tablets with different drug content are widely available without&#13;
guidance.&#13;
24.   Delayed and inadequate treatment are among the main causes of severity and death; a&#13;
study of hospitalized patients in the Infectious Diseases Department of Fann Hospital in Dakar in&#13;
1990, indicated that 51% of severe cases had received inadequate treatment before attending the&#13;
hospital; mortality in health posts serving areas with poor communications and scattered villages&#13;
seems to be much more frequent than in those serving more compact areas.&#13;
25.    There is an urgent need to improve early treatment, and particularly to enable mothers to&#13;
recognize signs of severity, requiring immediate referral to health services, while improving the&#13;
quality of care in the latter.&#13;
26.    Case Containment at the Health Facilities. At health facilities, the increasing deficit&#13;
of health personnel, the lack of motivation of health workers, the absence of supervision, and the&#13;
breaks in stock of antimalarials and other essential drugs, contribute to the poor quality of&#13;
peripheral care. These factors are compounded by: a) almost complete disregard of microscopy&#13;
as a diagnostic aid, even for severe and complicated cases, in hospitals with well equipped&#13;
laboratories and trained technicians; b) inadequate management of severe cases, which do not&#13;
benefit from a parasitological monitoring of treatment; c) excessive prestige of injections, which&#13;
is often encouraged by health staff, leading to an abuse of parenteral quinine; d) tendency to use&#13;
the latest drugs without consideration to relative effectiveness, side effects or cost; and e)&#13;
ignorance of appropriate dosages.&#13;
27.    Confusing Sources of Information. Many media messages to the general public and&#13;
the number of circulating guidelines for health professionals are contradictory in recommending&#13;
different drugs and dosages.&#13;
28.    Confusing Tablet Formulations. Adding to the confusion, there is in circulation within&#13;
the health services, tablets with 100 and 150 mg of chloroquine base, some even with 250 mg.&#13;
Similarly, chloroquine syrup may be dosed at 25 or 50 mg per coffee spoon. This may be very&#13;
confusing, particularly for lay treatment providers for whom doses will continue to be expressed&#13;
in numbers of tablets in lieu of mg/kg. These problems are further complicated by the existence&#13;
of an illicit parallel market where all sorts of drugs, including counterfeits, are available.&#13;
29.    No Active Participation in Monitoring Drug Resistance. Health services neither&#13;
record nor report treatment failures.&#13;
30.    Excessive Use of Anti-malarial Drugs. It is due not only to excessive prescriptions for&#13;
the treatment of malaria, but also because an anti-malarial treatment, particularly the use of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 6 of 18&#13;
chloroquine, is included in the recommended treatment of all fever episodes, even if a clear&#13;
cause of the fever can be identified. The excessive use of anti-malarials is not only wasteful but,&#13;
more importantly, contributes to the selection of drug resistance. An April 1996 inquiry into the&#13;
consumption of anti-malarials, gave figures, for chloroquine only, of 2 to 5 times higher than&#13;
necessary to treat the malaria cases reported.&#13;
B. CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS&#13;
31.    As mentioned above, it continues to be used, with the intention of protecting young&#13;
children, in many areas, despite contrary recommendations from the center. It should be&#13;
reserved for the protection of pregnant women, particularly primigravidae, as it is the best way of&#13;
preventing low birth weight, and they do not constitute such an important parasite reservoir as&#13;
young children.&#13;
C. SELECTIVE VECTOR CONTROL&#13;
32.    Endemic malaria represents a certain equilibrium between the human, vector and&#13;
parasite populations. High endemicity is equivalent to very stable epidemiological equilibrium,&#13;
both vector and parasite populations are many times higher than required for species survival.&#13;
Very important reductions in the parasite reservoir or in the vector population, by mass treatment&#13;
or by vector control, are rapidly compensated and the population returns to their original levels,&#13;
once the control activity is interrupted. Malaria parasites are well tolerated by people surviving&#13;
early childhood, most people becoming asymptomatic carriers thereafter. The higher the&#13;
endemicity, the lower the age of immunity development. This solid herd immunity is achieved&#13;
at a cost of high childhood mortality. In areas of low endemicity, such as the Dakar area, severe&#13;
malaria and mortality is relatively frequent in older children and young adults, as mentioned&#13;
above.&#13;
33.    By contrast, in areas of very low malaria endemicity, under normal conditions,&#13;
transmission does not occur, generally because vectors cannot survive the sufficient time for&#13;
parasite development, either because of low relative humidity or low temperatures.&#13;
Nevertheless, most of these areas are periodically subject to abnormal rains or floods, which not&#13;
only provide extensive vector breeding, but also relatively long periods of humidity/temperature&#13;
conditions favorable to malaria transmission with epidemic outbreaks. Observations in Congo,&#13;
Tanzania, Kenya and Senegal indicate that merely reducing transmission in endemic areas, may&#13;
reduce severe morbidity and mortality in young children but place them at higher risk at older&#13;
ages, without a net cohort benefit.&#13;
34.   These observations support the abandonment of vector control as the main element of&#13;
malaria control, in accordance with the global strategy adopted in Amsterdam in 1992. Vector&#13;
control has, nevertheless, a place in malaria control as a complement of a strategy based on the&#13;
development of health services, particularly if it concentrates on interventions which do not&#13;
require the repeated implementation of strictly organized activities and a high level of coverage&#13;
to be effective. This is the reason why large scale campaigns of indoor insecticide spraying are&#13;
hardly ever recommended. In contrast, the followings may be very useful:&#13;
(a)   the promotion and support of the use of bednets in areas where their use is&#13;
considered desirable, or the introduction of insecticide impregnation, in areas where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 7 of 18&#13;
bednets are in use; such actions could be sustainable complements of the general&#13;
improvement of case management. Individuals using bednets are protected, even if&#13;
coverage is very low, and coverage may progressively spread as bednets become&#13;
more widely accessible.&#13;
(b)    a point intervention, with re-impregnation of existing bednets, with indoor&#13;
insecticide spraying, or with well timed space spraying, when an information system&#13;
has detected the occurrence of an epidemic risk.&#13;
(c)   the organization of timed interventions, like the re-impregnation of bednets, to&#13;
decrease the peak of seasonal epidemics in areas subject to short intense&#13;
transmission periods.&#13;
D. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM AND EPIDEMIC&#13;
PREVENTION OR CONTROL&#13;
.3 S    It should be the backbone of any disease control activity, but it cannot be limited to a&#13;
isingie disease even as important as malaria. It should be incorporated in the functioning of the&#13;
gerneral health services and not viewed as an external imposition. Regional epidemiologists,&#13;
particularly in areas subject to periodic increases of epidemic risk, should be provided with the&#13;
e~apacity of analysis to monitor the epidemiological situation of malaria, and to investigate local&#13;
abnoormalities, organize local response and/or request assistance from the center. In order to&#13;
drovelop such capacity, it will be necessary: a) to determine the major determinants of epidemic&#13;
sk which should be monitored regularly, e.g. rainfall, floods or humidity/temperature, to&#13;
dtter7mine levels indicative of epidemic risk, and to identify the sources of information and&#13;
.&amp;, ganize monitoring mechanisms; b) to organize the immediate reporting by telephone, fax or e-&#13;
nMaii of suspected epidemiological emergencies; and c) to prepare emergency plans to be&#13;
imnplemented in response to risk situations or detected emergencies.&#13;
-3 V. OPERATIONAL TOOLS FOR MALARIA CONTROL ACTIVITIES&#13;
A. ORGANIZATION OF DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FACILITIES&#13;
36.    The provision of prompt diagnosis and opportune treatment to the sick constitutes the&#13;
mnost elementary intervention in the Global Malaria Control Strategy, being considered as a basic&#13;
human right. The number and type of services required for the adequate management of malaria&#13;
disease will vary in relation to the prevalence of the disease and the risk of severity and death.&#13;
The feasibility of providing the required services will depend on the stage of development of the&#13;
;gent-eral health services and their use by the population, the human and material resources, and&#13;
the degree of community collaboration.&#13;
*i1    First Line Care: Health Posts. Because it normally responds to a simple, safe and&#13;
cheap treatment, malaria has been traditionally managed by the most peripheral health services&#13;
aid their projections into communities, using rather loose diagnostic criteria with very low&#13;
specificity. On the other hand, treatment of severe and complicated malaria is a medical&#13;
emergency requiring intensive care and presenting a high risk of death. It is therefore essential&#13;
chneit peripheral services should be able to recognize signs of severity, and be backed by adequate&#13;
refeiTal services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
Anneo 'M&#13;
Page 8 of it&#13;
38.     The preparation of diagnosis, and treatment guidelines for the training and use of&#13;
peripheral health workers, is indispensable for the recognition of conditions which could be&#13;
handled by the first line care services and those that would require referral. Such guidelines&#13;
should include the steps to be taken in initiating treatment of severe cases in their way to referral,&#13;
and would be prepared in consultation with local health authorities, clinicians and consultants,&#13;
and be adapted to the local pathology, the competencies and the resources available or&#13;
potentially available.&#13;
39.     Both the prevalence of resistant P. falciparum and the risk of severity should guide the&#13;
development of laboratory facilities for microscopical diagnosis. In areas of high resistance,&#13;
microscopic diagnosis in health centers of severe fevers would permit the differential diagnosis&#13;
of severe P. falciparum malaria which should be immediately referred to hospital, and negatives&#13;
which will require further search for diagnostic clues or be referred. Similarly, the differential&#13;
diagnosis of peripheral treatment failures could permit the detection of drug resistant infections.&#13;
40.     Maternal and child care may be provided in organized MCH clinics. Any such sern icc-&#13;
should be used to educate mothers on the risk of delaying diagnosis and treatment of fevers in&#13;
young children. If there is any form of prenatal care, it should be used to provide&#13;
chemoprophylaxis, or intermittent preventive treatments to primigravidae.&#13;
41.     Referral Services. They would normally be provided by ensuring a working liaison&#13;
between peripheral health posts and health centers and hospitals in the area for the referral of&#13;
severe fever cases and treatment failures. In any case, it should be ensured that diagnostic and&#13;
treatment practices at all levels are adequate to the local problems.&#13;
B. TRANSMISSION CONTROL MEASURES&#13;
42.     The selection and use of preventive measures should be guided by considerations of&#13;
feasibility, effectiveness and sustainability, as defined in the Global Malaria Control Strategy. i n&#13;
principle, all malarial interventions could be considered for possible application, if suited to tht&#13;
local problem and human material resources. A classification of these measures is presented in&#13;
table 2.&#13;

Peridomestic sanitation would not be effective unless it forms part of a participatory collective action of the whole&#13;
community (Bruce-Chwatt., 1985.)&#13;
Reduction of Man-mosquito Contact&#13;
43.    The use of bednets, particularly pyrethroid impregnated bednets, is a very effective&#13;
method of personal protection when vector activity occurs at the time when people have retired&#13;
under the net. In most circumstances, the effect of bednets is more evident in the protection of&#13;
infants and young children who are put to bed while adults remain exposed in the early hours of&#13;
the night. Nevertheless, many of the most serious malaria vectors have their peak activity in the&#13;
central hours of the night, and bednets therefore can considerably reduce man vector contact and&#13;
cause great mortality among mosquitoes attracted to man, when bednets are used by a large&#13;
proportion of the population.&#13;
Measures Against Adult Vectors&#13;
44.    Indoor insecticide spraying has been the traditional transmission control measure for&#13;
mass application, and its implementation has been thoroughly standardized. In Senegal, only&#13;
very small scale application was ever made, and the basic material and human resources to begin&#13;
or expand its application in a cost-effective manner are very limited.&#13;
45.    Indoor spraying of residual insecticides, even if it does not have the predominant role&#13;
given in the past, is one of the most effective ways of reducing malaria transmission, and still has&#13;
an important role in malaria control, particularly in the prevention and control of epidemic&#13;
outbreaks. It should be indicated in situations where its use could be clearly targeted, and&#13;
limited in time and place where the effectiveness and quality of the spraying could be&#13;
maintained, even if periodic applications may be required. Insecticide toxicity and the hazard&#13;
they may represent for spraymen and the inhabitants of sprayed houses, as well as for the&#13;
environment, should be major concerns when contemplating their use.&#13;
46.    Traditionally, DDT has been considered the insecticide of first choice, because of its low&#13;
toxicity to man, its relatively long residual effect, the slow development of resistance, as well as&#13;
the fact that the most common mechanism of DDT resistance does not confer a cross resistance&#13;
to other insecticides. Its long persistence in the environment proscribes its use outdoors,&#13;
particularly as larvicide. Nevertheless, its use as an indoor spray has been maintained due to the&#13;
low probability that spayed surfaces, even of demolished houses, will become agricultural land&#13;
or otherwise enter the environmental food chain. New synthetic pyrethroids with long residual&#13;
effect, such as deltamethrin and lambda-cyalothrin which are effective at very low doses (25-50&#13;
mg/m2) with a very low toxicity, are also relatively competitive with DDT regarding the cost of&#13;
applications for malaria control.&#13;
47.    Space spraying of insecticides was the first adulticiding method used to control malaria&#13;
transmission, based on the attack of adult mosquitoes resting indoors with pyrethrum extracts&#13;
dissolved in kerosene (Park Ross, 1936). In general, it is considered that space spraying has very&#13;
few indications for malaria control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 10 of 18&#13;
Measures Aiming at the Destruction of Mosquitoe Larvae&#13;
48.   Domestic and peridomestic sanitation has a general value in improving the quality of&#13;
life. The impact on malaria transmission of destroying mosquito breeding places depends on the&#13;
bionomics of the particular vector species. The elimination of peridomestic mosquito breeding&#13;
places, including the protection of domestic water containers, and the maintenance of clean&#13;
surroundings would have a general health interest but the specific measure, which may affect&#13;
malaria transmission, would vary from area to area. It should be considered that, as an&#13;
antimalarial measure, peridomestic sanitation requires a high coverage in order to be effective; a&#13;
single remaining active breeding place may suffice to maintain an important focus of&#13;
transmission.&#13;
49.   Larviciding, as an antimalarial measure, has limited applicability as it affects only&#13;
vector density and requires a very high coverage for effectiveness, without the advantages of&#13;
sustainability and socioeconomic benefits that sanitation may have.&#13;
50.   Biological control includes the use of mosquito pathogens and predators. Although&#13;
there are a number of known mosquito pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi and&#13;
nematodes), few have been for mosquito control, and none have reached operational use for&#13;
malaria control.&#13;
Source Reduction&#13;
51.   Environmental sanitation constitutes the most effective and sustainable measure for the&#13;
protection of dense human settlements and urban areas. The effectiveness of environmental&#13;
sanitation on malaria transmission was recognized for a long time before its biological basis was&#13;
understood. Implementation of community-wide environmental sanitation requires the&#13;
mobilization and commitment of important community resources, not only for promoting,&#13;
supporting and coordinating individual action, but, in most situations, for the undertaking of&#13;
engineering works. It is therefore essential that such actions would be carefully planned, based&#13;
on the appropriate knowledge of local epidemiology and the bionomics of the vectors it is&#13;
intended to control. It is necessary to ensure the continuous availability of professional&#13;
entomological and engineering competence for the planning and execution of sanitation projects,&#13;
the evaluation of which has to be determined not only for malaria control but from the point of&#13;
view of their general health and socioeconomic impact.&#13;
52.   Environmental sanitation would consist of the selection of appropriate measures among&#13;
the followings.&#13;
(a)    Drainage, filling and prevention of unnecessary surface water collection which are&#13;
among the most traditional antimosquito measures, although they have been mainly&#13;
undertaken in response to economic incentives.  Unfortunately, drainage of&#13;
unwanted water seldom has the economic interest of the introduction of water for&#13;
irrigation, so that a large proportion of major irrigation projects have not completed&#13;
the construction of appropriate drainage systems, or, if constructed, are seldom&#13;
properly maintained. Similarly, leakage of irrigation canals, overflows and misuse&#13;
of irrigation water often produces extensive breeding places ,and, eventually, water&#13;
logging, which is not only a major cause of malaria but also of land degradation,&#13;
leading to salinization and eventual desertification.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 11 of 18&#13;
(b)    Artificial shading or clearing of river or canal banks, changes in plant-water-air&#13;
interface, changes in salinity, desalinization of coastal swamps, increase of the&#13;
organic content of breeding places have very limited local applicability.&#13;
Community Participation&#13;
53.    The global malaria control strategy places the greatest emphasis on the building of local&#13;
capabilities to understand and solve problems in the hope of reaching every home or every&#13;
patient, more than in the massive use of drugs or insecticides. The strategy promotes the&#13;
establishment of all possible intersectoral linkages, as well as community involvement. The&#13;
main aim of public information and education should be: to improve peripheral management of&#13;
fevers, particularly in young children in highly endemic areas, to improve the utilization of&#13;
health care facilities, and to obtain the actual participation of individuals and communities&#13;
instead of the passive acceptance of antimalarial drugs or spraying. School should play a key&#13;
role as an instrument of education, not only for children, but also using all forms of adult&#13;
education, as well as making all efforts to engage the collaboration of existing community&#13;
organizations.&#13;
54.    This participatory antimalaria strategy gives a prominent role to the development of&#13;
malaria safe habits, including the use of personal protection measures and chemoprophylaxis&#13;
during pregnancy. It appears obvious that the development of such habits cannot only be a&#13;
function of the school. Women could be essential partners, if their social status would permit&#13;
their incorporation into the education process.&#13;
Early Detection and Containment, or Prevention of Epidemics&#13;
55.   Ideally, malaria epidemics should be forecast and prevented rather than detected and&#13;
controlled. Such forecasting may be possible if based on a dynamic information system capable&#13;
of identifying high risk periods, areas and populations, and of designing and implementing&#13;
appropriate measures of control. As the most relevant information for such identification is of an&#13;
ecological, meteorological, social or economic nature, it is necessary to establish linkages and&#13;
obtain information on these variables, as well as on plans and status of implementation of&#13;
economic development projects.&#13;
56.    nevertheless, epidemics are most frequently recognized only when well advanced in their&#13;
evolution and, many times, either the epidemic is subsiding or it has resulted in a well&#13;
established higher level of endemicity. Under these circumstances, not much benefit may be&#13;
expected from the mobilization of extraordinary control measures, particularly if they are not&#13;
ready for immediate implementation.&#13;
57.   In general, the most urgently needed control measures, in the face of a detected&#13;
epidemic, consist in strengthening disease management. If the epidemic has been detected at the&#13;
beginning of a potentially long transmission season, residual insecticide spraying should be&#13;
considered, particularly if it has been included in emergency preparedness plans, and it is&#13;
possible to have the required resources immediately available. Unfortunately, in most cases,&#13;
spraying is recommended as the main response without having the capacity to do so in time, so&#13;
that spraying is done after transmission has occurred, and thus totally wasted. If preventive&#13;
measures cannot be mobilized in time, consideration should be given to mass fever treatment or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;

even mass drug administration. Residual insecticide spraying should be supplemented with the&#13;
strengthening of the epidemiological information system and the diagnostic and treatment&#13;
facilities, public information and education, the promotion and support of personal protection&#13;
measures, and the mobilization of intersectoral collaboration.&#13;
V.    MALARIA CONTROL STRATEGY&#13;
A. GENERAL OBJECTIVES&#13;
58.   The national malaria control strategy has established the reduction of malaria mortality&#13;
and morbidity in the general population, particularly in children and pregnant women, as a&#13;
general objective of the program. It has set the following targets for the first five years:&#13;
(a)    Reduce by 50% the malaria specific mortality in the general population, and&#13;
particularly in children less than 5 years old;&#13;
(b)    Reduce by 20% malaria morbidity in the general population; and&#13;
(c)    Reduce by 50% the incidence of severe malaria among pregnant women.&#13;
B. APPROACHES&#13;
First Objective&#13;
59.   The technical approach to achieve a sustainable reduction of malaria specific mortality,&#13;
according to the WHO global malaria control strategy, is to improve case management&#13;
throughout the country by making adequate diagnosis and prompt treatment accessible to&#13;
everybody, and by improving the utilization of this facility by the population. As shown in the&#13;
situation analysis, a number of serious problems hamper the quality of case management,&#13;
ranging from poor accessibility of health facilities, negative population attitudes, and cultural&#13;
barriers, to poor quality of care due to a lack of appropriate training for health staff, or&#13;
insufficient supplies of medicaments and materials. It is obvious that the solutions to these&#13;
problems will require action addressed at the communities, as well as at several levels of the&#13;
health services. The following approaches are therefore considered essential.&#13;
60.   To standardize first line antimalarial treatment. It will be necessary to support and&#13;
strengthen the normative function of the central level in order to ensure that it:&#13;
(a)    develops national guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria,&#13;
within the concept of managing common fevers in a peripheral setting; its main&#13;
purpose is to guide health posts and health committees, these guidelines should&#13;
include a clear statement of the first line drug, which remains oral chloroquine at a&#13;
dose of 25 mg of cloroquine base per kg of body weight, divided in three days,&#13;
taking at least 10 mg/kg the first day;&#13;
(b)    establishes a clinical definition of cases requiring an antimalarial treatment;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 13 of 18&#13;
(c)    translates the dosages of first line drugs from milligrams per kg of body weight into&#13;
number of tablets per age group, according to local conditions; and&#13;
(d)    defines signs of severity, which demand immediate referral to a health center or&#13;
hospital; the recognition of these signs should be a major component of the program&#13;
of health education of the population. The development of these national guidelines&#13;
will require the set up of an expert group with the participation of the University,&#13;
health professional associations, selected regional and district medical officers and&#13;
health post staff, WHO, ORSTOM and Institut Pasteur. This group should review&#13;
all existing recommendations, particularly the WHO guidelines for management of a&#13;
sick child, in order to adapt them to local conditions.&#13;
61.   It will be also necessary to: (i) reproduce and distribute to all treatment providers,&#13;
distribution should be reinforced with introductory and subsequent supervisory visits by health&#13;
personnel; (ii) review the National Clinical Guidelines to remove recommendations for excessive&#13;
use of antimalarials, and to incorporate into these guidelines the clinical criteria established; and&#13;
(iii) review all information, as it is generated, on drug susceptibility in order to consider whether&#13;
a change of first line treatment is needed.&#13;
62.    To standardize anti-malarial drugs, particularly those used at the periphery. It will&#13;
be necessary to: a) select a single tablet formulation of chloroquine for all government&#13;
purchases; this is particularly important to permit adequate dosage by lay treatment providers,&#13;
for whom doses will continue to be expressed in numbers of tablets, in lieu of mg/kg (the current&#13;
common availability of chloroquine tablets of 100 and of 150 mg may be a cause of serious&#13;
under-dosage); b) ensure that all drugs donated to the country conform to that requirement; and&#13;
c) require the same restrictions for all drug imports.&#13;
63.    To improve public awareness on opportunity of treatment, and home management.&#13;
Although it is recognized that home treatment is seldom adequate, it is also realized that it will&#13;
continue to be the most frequent form of management of common diseases such as malaria. The&#13;
strategy should therefore concentrate in strengthening the positive aspects of case management at&#13;
home, whilst continuing efforts to prevent the more serious negative ones. Public information&#13;
and education will be one of the most important lines of action to reduce malaria mortality, and&#13;
will concentrate on:&#13;
(a)    stressing the importance of immediately initiating treatment with chloroquine of any&#13;
fever with chills, particularly in children; children unable to swallow or to retain the&#13;
tablets, and those not responding to the treatment should be referred to the health&#13;
posts;&#13;
(b)    enabling mothers to recognize signs of severity (e.g. loss of conscience, abnormal&#13;
behavior, convulsions, intense pallor, little or no urine, jaundice), requiring&#13;
immediate referral to a health center or hospital, and to convince them that they&#13;
constitute a severe evolution of the disease, and not due to an independent spiritual&#13;
cause;&#13;
(c)    convincing mothers of the dangers of delaying treatment of severe fever cases, and&#13;
the effectiveness of timely medical treatment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 14 of 18&#13;
64.    A subgroup of the expert group with a broad representation of peripheral health workers&#13;
and local health committees should develop the technical messages to be included in the public&#13;
information and education program to achieve these objectives. All forms of illustrated and&#13;
written materials should be developed, but emphasis should be placed on persistent verbal&#13;
communication to obtain full understanding.&#13;
65.    To improve accessibility to diagnosis and treatment facilities. Particularly in large&#13;
areas with poor communications and small and rather scattered villages. It should be noted that&#13;
deaths due to malaria have been recorded in health posts serving such areas, and not in smaller&#13;
districts with denser distribution of villages. It will be necessary to: a) promote the&#13;
establishment of new health posts and local health committees in malaria-infested areas still too&#13;
far from existing ones; and b) support the establishment of antimalarial drug depots, during the&#13;
rainy season, in villages which may become isolated from the nearest health post during the peak&#13;
of the transmission season, or where the distances to the health post are too great.&#13;
66.    To improve malaria case management at the health services. Besides accessibility&#13;
and acceptance, health services need to improve the quality of care provided, particularly&#13;
regarding diagnostic and treatment practices. The strategy, therefore, calls for the followings.&#13;
(a)    The improvement of the competence of health staff by: (i) developing the malaria&#13;
component of training courses of all categories of health staff and of general&#13;
refresher training activities; (ii) organizing, when necessary, specific refresher&#13;
training; (iii) stressing the importance of microscopical diagnosis, particularly for&#13;
differential diagnosis of severe fever cases and treatment failures, as well as the&#13;
uncertainty of clinical diagnosis, particularly of P. falciparum infections, hardly ever&#13;
better than 40%, under the best conditions; and (iv) organizing, in collaboration with&#13;
University, ORSTOM, Pasteur Institute and WHO, national and regional seminars;&#13;
(b)    The improvement of laboratory diagnosis and its actual use by: (i) contributing to the&#13;
strengthening of laboratory services, prioritizing the development of appropriate&#13;
malaria microscopy in all regional hospitals; for the diagnosis of severe fever cases&#13;
and the follow-up of treatment of severe malaria, and in health centers located in&#13;
areas where parasite resistance is prevalent; for the differential diagnosis of&#13;
treatment failures of clinically diagnosed cases; and (ii) training and retraining&#13;
laboratory technicians in malaria microscopy;&#13;
(c)    The improvement in the management of severe malaria, by: (i) including the WHO&#13;
Guidelines on the Management of Severe and Complicated Malaria in all training&#13;
and retraining activities for medical staff, (ii) acquiring and distributing to all health&#13;
centers and hospital services the WHO manual and the computer self-training&#13;
program on the management of severe malaria;&#13;
(d)    The strengthening in the monitoring of drug sensitivity, by: (i) supporting the&#13;
existing capabilities for conducting surveys by ensuring the continued collaboration&#13;
of the health services with the University, ORSTOM and Pasteur Institute; (ii)&#13;
reporting treatment failures from the periphery; and (iii) developing, in health&#13;
centers with performing laboratory services, the capacity for conducting simplified&#13;
sensitivity tests, and eventually developing a network of sentinel posts for&#13;
monitoring drug resistance with the collaboration of currently involved institutions;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 15 of 18&#13;
(e)    The incorporation of malaria requirements into the development of a national drug&#13;
policy incorporating: (i) a clear definition of first and second line drugs, and the&#13;
procedures for their updating; and (ii) the inclusion of second line drugs, currently&#13;
sulfadoxin-pyrimethamine, in the national list of essential drugs;&#13;
(f)    The development and support of a formative supervision system at district, regional&#13;
and national levels, stressing reinforcement of local capabilities, retraining and&#13;
strengthening support over the mere policing of activities. Such a system should be&#13;
based on the full utilization of the epidemiological information system, by: (i)&#13;
strengthening the capacity of analysis of the epidemiological situation at the regional&#13;
level to monitor trends, identify lacunae, recognize and delimit problems and initiate&#13;
epidemiological investigation, request central support if necessary and, eventually,&#13;
organize emergency control; (ii) avoiding the consolidation of heterogeneous data,&#13;
such as malaria cases diagnosed by medical and non-medical treatment providers, or&#13;
clinical and microscopically diagnosed cases; (iii) ensuring the immediate reporting&#13;
by telephone, FAX or e-mail of any suspected epidemiological emergency situation;&#13;
and (iv) maintaining, through the epidemiological information system, an updated&#13;
analysis of the epidemiological situation, including the results of drug sensitivity&#13;
testing, and communicating directly to any district medical officer, any&#13;
epidemiological information of particular interest to their district.&#13;
Second Objective&#13;
67.    The main effect of improved case management will be a reduction of malaria mortality,&#13;
severity and duration of incapacity; it may therefore include a reduction of prevalence of&#13;
symptomatic malaria, but it should not be expected to result in a reduction of incidence. The full&#13;
achievement of the second objective will require the implementation of some form of&#13;
transmission control. There exist a number of well known methods to reduce malaria&#13;
transmission which fall into the following categories:&#13;
(a)    source reduction, including all forms of larval control, only useful when breeding&#13;
places are few in relation to the population; they are therefore inapplicable to the&#13;
conditions of rural tropical Africa. These methods require a high level of coverage&#13;
to have any effect, being, therefore, not suitable for individual protection;&#13;
(b)    chemoprophylaxis, which is basically a method of individual protection; when used&#13;
as a public health control method, it shows rapidly a marked effect when first&#13;
introduced, but it is very difficult to maintain for long periods and often results in&#13;
local epidemics when interrupted; its continuous use is recognized as one of the&#13;
main factors in selecting resistant parasite strains;&#13;
(c)    indoor insecticide spraying requires a high coverage to be effective and, therefore,&#13;
requires organized disciplined spray teams; its continued use is likely to select vector&#13;
resistance and has resulted in local epidemics when discontinued; it is not suitable&#13;
for individual protection;&#13;
(d)    bednets, particularly insecticide impregnated bednets; a method of individual&#13;
protection, which can extend into widespread use and be very effective particularly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 16 of 18&#13;
for vectors biting predominantly in the middle of the night; generally most effective&#13;
for the protection of young children and infants.&#13;
68.   It is recognized that in areas of high stable endemicity, any form of vector control is&#13;
likely to result only in a relatively small delay in the age of occurrence of morbidity and&#13;
mortality.&#13;
69.   The only control methods suitable for large scale implementation are, therefore, the use&#13;
of impregnated bednets and, on very focal applications, indoor residual spraying for the&#13;
prevention of malaria epidemics of short expected duration, when they can act as a fore-caster&#13;
with reasonable accuracy.&#13;
70.   Impregnated bednets. As mentioned above this method is fully additive, i.e. it does not&#13;
require a high coverage threshold to be effective, it can begin by being used by a small&#13;
proportion of the population, who will be protected, and progressively spread into large scale&#13;
use. It nevertheless requires, in order to be effective, that vector biting habits and people&#13;
activities after dusk do not coincide to produce important disease transmission before retiring&#13;
under the net. A. gambiae and A. arabiensis, the main vectors in Senegal, bite predominantly in&#13;
the central hours of the night so that the method is potentially effective and, experience in The&#13;
Gambia has shown that it can produce an important reduction in childhood mortality and&#13;
morbidity, when the use of bednets is accepted by the population (much greater impact in the&#13;
western and central districts than the East of the country, in relation to people's acceptability of&#13;
bednets).&#13;
71.   It therefore requires a basic acceptability by the population; this is commonly assured in&#13;
areas with high density of nuisance mosquitoes, particularly early biters which interfere with&#13;
people's sleep. Many people object to using bednets in areas of high humidity and little air&#13;
circulation. There are also many cultural factors which may or may not favor the acceptability of&#13;
bednets.&#13;
72.   Another essential factor to take into consideration is the problem of affordability;&#13;
bednets, and their impregnation, are generally too expensive for most people. In The Gambia, a&#13;
very successful project, when impregnation was provided free of charge, failed when a charge of&#13;
about US$0.50 was claimed for bednet impregnation.&#13;
73.   In Senegal, non-impregnated bednets are in wide use in the North, along the river&#13;
Senegal (the St. Louis Region), and in similar areas of Louga and part of Tambacounda; these&#13;
are also areas with very unstable malaria transmission, with great variation of rainfall from year&#13;
to year and, in some areas, periodic risk of floods. Under these conditions, they appear as&#13;
suitable areas for the implementation of an impregnated bednet program, based on the promotion&#13;
and support of bednet production and impregnation. Production and sale could be based on local&#13;
cooperatives or women associations, who could also undertake the impregnation and re-&#13;
impregnation under the supervision of the health post&#13;
74.   The project strategy, therefore, will consist of:&#13;
(a)    during the first year: study the opportunities and modalities for local production and&#13;
commercialization of bednets, the organization of impregnation and possible system&#13;
of cost recovery;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 17 of 18&#13;
(b)    during the second year: test one or two alternatives of organization and functioning&#13;
of the system and their articulation with the health services;&#13;
(c)   last three years: full incorporation into the health services and health information&#13;
system.&#13;
75.    Forecasting and prevention of epidemic outbreaks. Malaria endemicity in Senegal&#13;
decreases, in general from south to north and from east to west and, although the country does&#13;
not suffer the classical devastating regional epidemics of malaria of densely populated&#13;
subtropical dry areas, it has large areas affected by periodic local outbreaks, which may produce&#13;
serious increases of mortality and incapacity; these areas of unstable malaria transmission&#13;
coincide with the Sahelian eco-epidemiological zone described in the situation analysis; the most&#13;
densely populated part of this area lays along the Senegal river valley, and it is constituted by the&#13;
St. Louis Region and the Bakel district of the Tambacounda Region.&#13;
76.   Epidemic outbreaks appear to be triggered by particular combinations of extensive&#13;
floods and high local rainfall, which will produce massive anopheline breeding and the necessary&#13;
humidity/temperature to allow sufficient vector survival for the development of the parasite.&#13;
Historical data indicates that these situations may last one or two years and be repeated with a&#13;
periodicity of approximately five years, which may relate to the paraquinquenial cycle described&#13;
elsewhere. It also seems that the main determinant, at least in the lower half of the river may be&#13;
the floods, which could be predicted by receiving information of the level of river raising&#13;
upstream.&#13;
77.   increased vector breeding due to high rainfall will produce a malaria outbreak about a&#13;
month later, while the effect of floods will be seen a month after the floods have subsided and&#13;
left pools of stagnant water. These periods give the time necessary for the implementation of&#13;
preventive measures. Historical records also indicate that the peak of rainfall occurs in August-&#13;
September, while the river swelling occurs in September-October. If the area were protected by&#13;
bednet impregnation, which normally would have been done before the rainy season in June, the&#13;
detection of an epidemic risk would require the emergency re-impregnation of bednets in the&#13;
areas at risk.&#13;
78.    The prediction of an incoming flood, and the knowledge of how villages might be&#13;
affected will, therefore, permit the implementation of certain preventive measures, such as: a)&#13;
restocking of health posts, and high risk villages, with anti-malarial drugs for the emergency&#13;
period; b) re-impregnation of bednets, and c) eventually, emergency indoor insecticide spraying.&#13;
79.   The implementation of the Health Information System will permit the analysis of the&#13;
local significance of the factors mentioned above, as well as, in certain areas, more detailed&#13;
analysis of the influence of temperature and humidity, in the production of local epidemic&#13;
outbreaks. Such studies will permit the definition of indicators of epidemic risk which could be&#13;
incorporated into the epidemiological information system.&#13;
80.   The project strategy consists of:&#13;
(a)    studying, during the first year, potential determinants of epidemic risk in areas of&#13;
unstable malaria transmission; mapping of the areas affected by each major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 18 of 18&#13;
determinant and identification of localities at risk; defining indicators with predictive&#13;
value, and negotiation for the acquisition of timely information on their variation;&#13;
(b)    during the second year, incorporating of indicators into the health information&#13;
system at the level of regional epidemiological analysis; organization of alarm&#13;
mechanisms, emergency preparedness and response capabilities; evaluation.&#13;
(c)    during the last three years, operationalizing the system.&#13;
Third Objective&#13;
81.   The current technical recommendation for preventing severe malaria in pregnant women,&#13;
as well as for preventing low birth weight in areas of high endemicity, is the implementation of a&#13;
program of chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women, particularly during their first pregnancy.&#13;
This strategy has confronted, practically everywhere, serious problems of compliance and&#13;
coverage and different evaluations have suggested, as a possible alternative, periodic treatment&#13;
courses (e.g. once a month, or at each attendance at a prenatal consultation) and immediate&#13;
treatment of any clinical manifestation.&#13;
82.   The project strategy will be: (i) the continued promotion and support of&#13;
chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy; (ii) the continued evaluation of severe manifestations&#13;
during pregnancy; (iii) the follow-up of field research on possible alternatives for the protection&#13;
of pregnant women, and consideration of their possible adoption.&#13;

LES BILHARZIOSES&#13;
I.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
Historique&#13;
1.    DejA citee dans le papyrus d'Eber (1,500 avant J.-C.), l'existence de bilharzioses A S.&#13;
haematobium a e etablie par la d6couverte d'oeufs calcifies dans la vessie d'une momie&#13;
egyptienne de la XXeme dynastie (plus de 1,000 ans avant J.-C.). Au Moyen-Age, les medecins&#13;
arabes parlent de "pissements de sang" des caravaniers revenant de Tombouctou. En 1852,&#13;
Theodor Bilharz d6couvre et decrit S. haematobium. En 1904, Manson decrit les oeufs de S.&#13;
mansoni.&#13;
Definition&#13;
2.    Les bilharzioses sont des affections parasitaires dues A des vers plats, les bilharzies ou&#13;
schistosomes, hematophages vivant dans le systeme circulatoire. Cinq especes sont pathogenes&#13;
pour l'homme, mais deux seulement sont presentes au Senegal. Shistosoma haematobium est&#13;
I'agent de la bilharziose uro-genitale; Shistosoma mansoni est responsable de la bilharziose&#13;
intestinale.&#13;
3.    S'il a toujours exist6 des foyers diss6mines de bilharzioses a S. haematobium au Senegal,&#13;
la bilharziose A S. mansoni est un phenomene recent qui est lid aux modifications ecologiques&#13;
dues aux projets d'irrigation et a la construction de barrages sur le fleuve Senegal et en&#13;
Casamance. En particulier dans la region de St Louis, la construction du barrage de Diama en&#13;
1986 a ete A l'origine d'une epidemie foudroyante de bilharziose a S mansoni qui est toujours en&#13;
phase d'expansion.&#13;
Cycle parasitaire&#13;
4.    Les oeufs de S. haematobium ou de S mansoni excretes par l'homme dans les canaux ou&#13;
les mares d'eau douce liberent des miracidiums qui infestent l'h6te intermediaire, qui est un&#13;
mollusque d'eau douce. Le developpement de ces miracidiums dans l'h6te intermediaire aboutit&#13;
A la formation de larves qui s'echappent pour passer dans 1'eau avant de penetrer chez l'h6te&#13;
definitif, I'homme. L'infestation de I'homme s'effectue lors des bains dans des eaux douces,&#13;
contamin6es par les mollusques.&#13;
5.    Les bilharzioses humaines sont liees A la presence des mollusques h6tes intermediaires&#13;
dont 1'existence est conditionnee a des facteurs 6co-bio-climatiques bien definis. L'etude de ces&#13;
facteurs permet d'evaluer les risques d'apparition de la maladie bilharzienne. Enfin, il existe une&#13;
dynamique dans la distribution geographique des mollusques et une evolution dans leur r6le&#13;

epidemiologique. C'est pourquoi une surveillance malacologique constante et reguliere est&#13;
necessaire surtout dans les zones oui les conditions ecologiques changent.&#13;
6.     Les h6tes intermrdiaires des bilharzioses sont des petits mollusques d'eau douce. L'hote&#13;
intennediaire de la bilharziose humaine a S. mansoni au Senegal est Biomphalariapfeifferi. Les&#13;
h6tes intermrdiaires de la bilharziose humaine A S. haematobium sont au Senegal B. globosus,&#13;
B. senegalensis et B. umbilicatus. B. truncatus a toujours e  le bulin le plus frequent dans la&#13;
region de St Louis, probablement en raison de sa tolerance de la salinite, mais il n'intervient pas&#13;
actuellement dans la transmission de la bilharziose humaine dans cette region.&#13;
7.     Les gites de ces mollusques se trouvent toujours dans des eaux peu profondes, stagnantes&#13;
ou faiblement courantes, riches en matieres organiques et comportant une vegetation aquatique&#13;
qui sert de support et de nourriture aux mollusques. La temperature de l'eau doit etre comprise&#13;
entre 25 et 30 degres Celsius; par contre le pH et la salinite peuvent varier dans de larges&#13;
proportions; les mollusques preferent les zones ombragees, ils vivent en general a 20 ou 30 cm&#13;
de profondeur sur les tiges des plantes, les feuilles mortes ou la boue du fond. Enfin, il a b&#13;
remarque que ces mollusques etaient plus abondant dans la periode allant de mai A aouit, oil les&#13;
temperatures sont plus elevees (23 A 30 degres Celsius).&#13;
8.    B. pfeifferi est tres sensible A la dessiccation et ne vit que dans des gi^tes A eau&#13;
perrnanente et souillee. II n'est tolerant ni A la salinite de 1'eau ni au pH acide. Les bulins, tres&#13;
resistants A la secheresse a l'exception de B. globosus, peuvent vivre dans des mares temporaires&#13;
et etre transportes A grande distance par des boues sechees, les sabots des animaux, les oiseaux.&#13;
En saison seche, les densites de mollusques sont elevees dans les gites permanents.&#13;
H.    SYMPTOMATOLOGIE DES INFECTIONS A SCHISTOSOMES&#13;
Phase de penetration et phase d'invasion&#13;
9.     La symptomatologie est commune aux deux bilharzioses A S. haematobium et A S.&#13;
mansoni lors de la phase de penetration et de la phase d'invasion. La phase de penetration&#13;
correspond A la penetration transcutanee des furcocercaires et se traduit par une dermatite tres&#13;
discrete voire inapparente. La phase d'invasion correspond aux reactions de l'organisme mis en&#13;
contact avec les substances antigeniques et toxiques des vers et se traduit par des phenomenes&#13;
allergiques avec de la fievre, des sueurs et des cephalees. Cette phase n'est marquee que lors des&#13;
primo-infections; elle est discrete lors des reinfestations successives. Enfin, cette phase est plus&#13;
fr6quente et plus grave pour S. mansoni.&#13;
Phase d'etat&#13;
10.   C'est souvent la periode oui le patient decouvre sa maladie. Dans le cas de la bilharziose&#13;
a S. haematobium, cette periode correspond A la ponte de nombreux oeufs dans la vessie et&#13;
l'uretere. Les principaux sympt6mes sont l'hematurie, pratiquement toujours presentes, et des&#13;
troubles de la miction urinaire. Des complications apparaissent chez un faible pourcentage de&#13;
personnes infect6es, telles que des infections de la vessie et des st6noses ureterales qui peuvent&#13;
conduire A des atteintes graves des reins. Enfin, des signes cutanes (papules non prurigineuses)&#13;
peuvent etre observes sur les zones peri-ombilicales ou thoraciques.&#13;

11.    Dans le cas de la bilharziose a S. mansoni, cette periode apparait trois mois environ&#13;
apres le bain infestant et se traduit par une diarrhee et des douleurs abdominales. L'evolution de&#13;
cette atteinte intestinale est gen6ralement favorable, meme sans traitement. Le risque majeur de&#13;
cette maladie est la complication au niveau du foie qui peut entrainer la mort (emboles ovulaires&#13;
dans le foie--thrombose des veinules du foie--hepato-splenomegalie--hypertension&#13;
portale-&gt;h6morragies digestives-*ruptures de varices oesophagiennes-*mort). D'autres&#13;
complications peuvent &amp;re observees avec S. mansoni dues A des migrations des oeufs dans le&#13;
systeme cardio-pulmonaire et dans le systeme nerveux.&#13;
A l'echelle communautaire&#13;
12.   Il semble exister: (i) une correlation entre l'intensite de l'infection et le developpement&#13;
de complications graves ; (ii) une correlation entre la prevalence de la maladie et l'intensite de&#13;
l'infection; et (iii) une correlation entre la prevalence et le developpement de complications&#13;
graves.&#13;
III.   CARACTERISTIQuEs DES DIFFERENTES ZONES D'ENDEMIE&#13;
La Region de St Louis&#13;
13.    Ecologiquement, la region peut etre divisee en deux parties: le Walo qui correspond a la&#13;
plaine alluviale s'etendant sur une vingtaine de kms de part et d'autre du lit principal du fleuve et&#13;
dans laquelle on pratique des cultures de decrues, et le Dieri, zone semi-aride situee en bordure&#13;
du Walo ou se pratiquent les cultures pluviales; il inclut les vallees fossiles, en particulier, la&#13;
vallee du Ferlo.&#13;
14.    La vallee du fleuve Senegal est divisee en trois parties: la haute vallee qui se situe&#13;
presque entierement en territoire malien, la moyenne vallee qui s'etend sur pres de 500 km et qui&#13;
va de Matam A Richard-Toll, et le Delta qui s'6tend sur 170 km et qui va de Richard-Toll A St&#13;
Louis.&#13;
15.    Le Delta est lui-meme subdivise en cinq zones: le bas Delta du fleuve S6negal, le moyen&#13;
Delta du fleuve Senegal oiu se trouve la riviere Lampsar, le haut Delta du fleuve Senegal, le lac&#13;
de Guiers, et le Dieri situe au sud de la route principale St Louis- Matam.&#13;
(a)    Le bas Delta (Walo). Cette region est situee entre St Louis et Debi et entre le fleuve&#13;
Senegal et la riviere Djeuss. Avant la construction du barrage, il y avait peu&#13;
d'agriculture dans la zone A cause de l'intrusion de l'eau salke. Apres la&#13;
construction du barrage de Diama (1986), des projets d'irrigation furent developpes.&#13;
(b)    Le moyen Delta (Walo). Cette region a et depuis longtemps protegee de&#13;
l'intrusion de l'eau salee par de petits barrages pour fournir de l'eau douce A St&#13;
Louis.&#13;
(c)    Le haut Delta (Walo). Cette region etait envahie par les eaux salkes avant la&#13;
construction du barrage Diama; elle est maintenant une zone importante pour la&#13;
culture du riz et de la canne A sucre. Cette zone est situee entre le fleuve Senegal et&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63&#13;

Page 4 of 17&#13;
la route principale, entre Debi et Dagana. Elle inclut les villes de Ross-Bethio et&#13;
Richard-Toll.&#13;
(d)    Le lac de Guiers. Un canal relie le fleuve Sen6gal et le lac de Guiers qui est la&#13;
principale source d'eau de Dakar. Les activites agricoles sont importantes et&#13;
comprennent les cultures du riz et de la canne a sucre.&#13;
(e)    Le Dieri. Le Dieri s'etend des deux bords du lac de Guiers et est limite au nord par&#13;
la route principale St Louis- Matam et au sud par la region de Louga. La population&#13;
est principalement nomade, Peul et Maure.&#13;
16.    La moyenne vallee s'etend dans une plaine alluviale de 20 km de large et peut etre&#13;
divisee en deux zones: le Walo ou est pratiquee la culture irriguee de riz, et le Di&amp;ri, sec, au sud&#13;
de la route principale. Dans la moyenne vallee, le Dieri inclut les vallees fossiles, en particulier&#13;
la vallee fossile du Ferlo. Les vallees fossiles font l'objet d'un projet de revitalisation grace a un&#13;
projet d'irrigation a partir des crues du fleuve Senegal. Au sud de Matam, la vallee se retrecit et&#13;
se creusejusqu'a la haute vallee.&#13;
Les autres regions&#13;
17.    Suite a l'enquete de prevalence effectuee dans le cadre de la preparation du projet en&#13;
avril 96, les zones touchees par les bilharzioses se distinguent en deux groupes. Le premier&#13;
groupe correspond aux zones endemiques riveraines du fleuve Faleme, et de la riviere Anambe,&#13;
qui font l'objet de programmes d'irrigation et de developpement agricole; le deuxieme groupe&#13;
correspond aux zones endemiques qui ne peuvent etre rattachees a des bassins fluviaux, telles&#13;
que celles situees dans les regions de Diourbel, Kaolack, Fatick, Tambacounda et Thies et qui&#13;
sont liees a des mares temporaires.&#13;
18.    Dans le bassin de la Faleme, la region endemique se situe autour de Bakel ou les&#13;
perimetres irrigues sont tres nombreux. Le bassin compte environ 150 villages pour une&#13;
population approximative de 25,000 habitants. Dans cette region, l'emigration est tres&#13;
importante. Dans le bassin de l'Anambe, la zone endemique est liee au programmme de&#13;
developpement de riziculture irriguee. Le bassin compte environ 200 villages peuplds par pres&#13;
de 30,000 habitants dont la majorite est impliquee dans le projet rizicole.&#13;
19.    Dans les regions endemiques qui ne peuvent etre rattachees a des bassins fluviaux, la&#13;
bilharziose urinaire se developpe en foyers a proximite de mares temporaires infestees par des&#13;
mollusques-vecteurs. Ces mares temporaires sont assechees de mars ajuillet. Pendant cette&#13;
periode les mollusques s'enfoncent dans la terre pour ressortir a la saison des pluies lors de la&#13;
reconstitution des mares. II est estimd qu'au moins 200 villages (population approximative de&#13;
100,000 habitants) sont endemiques a cause de la proximite de mares temporaires infestees, dont&#13;
au minimum 1 00 villages dans la region de Tambacounda.&#13;
20.    La rdgion de Ziguinchor, qui n'a pas ete incluse dans l'enquete, comprend des zones&#13;
endemiques liees aux barrages anti-sel d'Affiniam (departement de Bignona) et de Guidel&#13;
(ddpartement de Ziguinchor) et des foyers endemiques liNs a des mares temporaires. II est estime&#13;
qu'environ une centaine de villages sont endemiques pour une population approximative 50,000&#13;
habitants.&#13;

IV.   LA SITUATION EPIDEMIQUE ACTUELLE DES BILHARZIOSES HUMAINES&#13;
La region de St Louis&#13;
21.    Bilharziose a S. haematobium. Le detail des resultats par village montre des&#13;
differences importantes dans la prevalence et l'intensite de la bilharziose A S. haematobium et&#13;
reflete des niveaux variables de transmission dans les differentes zones du bassin du fleuve&#13;
Senegal. Le plus grand nombre de villages infectes et les villages ayant les plus fortes&#13;
prevalences et les plus fortes infestations ont ete observes dans le bas Delta dans l'aire de la&#13;
riviere Lampsar, et a un niveau moindre dans la zone Walo de la moyenne vallee. Dans la zone&#13;
du Dieri, seulement 6 villages sont infectes bien que les conditions de vie soient les memes. Ces&#13;
resultats soulignent la nature extremement localisee de la transmission de la bilharziose.&#13;
22.    Bilharziose a S. mansoni. Les prevalences sont les plus hautes dans le haut Delta avec&#13;
une prevalence moyenne de 95.6% et dans tous les villages autour du Lac de Guiers ou l'on&#13;
trouve une prevalence moyenne de 71.8%. Les prevalence sont moyennes dans la zone du Bas&#13;
Delta / riviere de Lampsar avec une prevalence moyenne de 22.8%. Par contre les prevalences&#13;
sont encore basses dans le bas Delta du fleuve Senegal.&#13;
Les autres regions&#13;
23.    Les resultats d'une enquete de prevalence realisee en avril 1996 dans le cadre de la&#13;
preparation de ce projet montre les resultats suivants.&#13;
(a)    a) II n'a pas et trouve de cas de bilharziose intestinale (S. mansoni) en dehors de la&#13;
region de St Louis, A part quelques cas importes dans la region de Kolda.&#13;
(b)    b) II existe des foyers de bilharzioses urinaires dans pratiquement toutes les regions&#13;
du Senegal, A l'exception de celle de Dakar. Les details de l'enquete sont donnees plus&#13;
loin sous forme de carte.&#13;
Les tendances 6pid6miotogiques recentes dans la region de St Louis&#13;
24.    Depuis la construction du barrage de Diama, en 1986, les bilharzioses humaines A S.&#13;
haematobium et S. mansoni sont en expansion dans la region de St Louis. Avant la&#13;
construction du barrage, it n'existait pas de bilharzioses A S. mansoni. Seule la bilharziose A S.&#13;
haematobium etait presente A des taux de prevalence faible et dans des foyers tres localises.&#13;
25.    L'evolution de l'epidemie de bilharziose a S. mansoni est liee A l'evolution de l'h6te&#13;
intermediaire Biomphalaria pfeifferi. Avant la construction du barrage, Biomphalaria pfeifferi&#13;
n'etait present que dans la partie la plus douce du Lac de Guiers, et il n'y avait pas de cas de&#13;
bilharziose A S. mansoni. Depuis la construction du barrage, sa multiplication a e  foudroyante&#13;
aussi bien vers l'ouest qu'a l'est. Grace aux nouvelles conditions ecologiques, en particulier la&#13;
diminution de la salinite et l'alcalinisation de l'eau, Biomphalariapfeifferi a envahi de proche en&#13;
proche le Lac de Guiers, puis le Canal principal, les canaux d'irrigation, A Mbodienne et A Podor,&#13;
le canal et le marigot de Taouey, la riviere Lampsar et le fleuve Senegal.&#13;

26.    En 1988, les premiers cas de bilharzioses a S. mansoni sont decouverts A Richard-Toll;&#13;
en 1990, une etude montre que 60% des personnes examinees sont infectees. Les dernieres&#13;
enquetes montrent des prevalences moyennes de 44% dans le Walo et de 72% dans le lac de&#13;
Guiers. Elles montrent aussi des charges parasitaires tres importantes, mesurees par le decompte&#13;
des oeufs dans les selles. Un taux de 200 oeufs/lOml est considere comme une charge parasitaire&#13;
elevee; dans les villages endemiques de la region de St Louis, les charges parasitaires peuvent&#13;
atteindre plusieurs milliers d'oeufs/lOml, ce qui laisse supposer la presence de plusieurs&#13;
centaines de vers dans l'organisme.&#13;
27.    L'extreme rapidite et l'intensite de l'evolution de l'epidemie est non seulement due A la&#13;
grande multiplication de son h6te intermediaire mais aussi A la tres grande compatibilite de&#13;
celui-ci avec le parasite, ce qui est une particularite de l'epidemie de la region de St Louis. Les&#13;
taux d'infestation des Biomphalaria Pfeifferi sont extremement eleves et peuvent souvent&#13;
atteindre 100%. Enfin, la transmission A l'homme se fait toute l'annee et la reinfestation est tres&#13;
rapide. Il existe une tres grande dependance des populations aux eaux des canaux pour leurs&#13;
activites aussi bien economiques, domestiques que recreationnelles. Cette dependance presque&#13;
entiere des populations aux eaux des canaux est suffisante pour expliquer la reinfestation rapide&#13;
apres traitement. Elle met en cause l'int&amp;&amp; d'une strategie de traitement de masse sans d'autres&#13;
mesures d'accompagnement.&#13;
28.    Dans la region de St Louis, les etudes sur la prevalence et sur l'intensite de l'infestation&#13;
semblent demontrer les conclusions suivantes: (i) la prevalence est la plus importante chez les&#13;
sujets ages entre 10 et 20 ans, avec un pic vers 15 ans; (ii) la prevalence chez les sujets de plus&#13;
de 20 ans est plus importante dans les populations sans immunite ou avec une immunite&#13;
partielle; (iii) l'intensite de l'infection est plus importante dans les populations n'ayant pas&#13;
acquis d'immunite ou ayant une immunite partielle; (iv) l'intensite de l'infection est plus&#13;
importante chez les enfants entre 5 et 15 ans que chez les adultes; et (v) enfin, la reinfection est&#13;
plus rapide dans les populations n'ayant pas d'immunite ou ayant une immunite partielle, et chez&#13;
les enfants de moins de 5 A 15 ans.&#13;
29.    L'epidemie de bilharziose a S. haematobium est moins intense que celle de la&#13;
bilharziose A S. mansoni. Sa transmission est saisonnire (saison des pluies); les taux&#13;
d'infestation des mollusques toument autour de 40 A 50%; les taux de prevalence dans les&#13;
villages sont rarement superieurs A 50%; enfin, l'intensite des infestations est nettement moindre&#13;
que dans le cas de la bilharziose intestinale (&lt;500 oeufs/lOml). Les foyers d'extension se&#13;
trouvent surtout dans le departement de Podor, en particulier au niveau de l'Ile A Morphile, et&#13;
dans le departement de Dagana, surtout dans les foyers du bas-fleuve, Lampsar et Mbodienne.&#13;
30.    L'augmentation de la prevalence de la bilharziose A S. haematobium est la consequence&#13;
directe des programmes de developpement et d'irrigation fournissant les habitats qui facilitent la&#13;
multiplication des bulins B. senegalensis et B. globosus. La surface rizicole est passee de 12,000&#13;
hectares en 1983 A 67,788 ha en 1994. Est associee A la culture du riz la creation de canaux&#13;
d'irrigation et de mares temporaires qui sont les habitats privilegies de Bulinus senegalensis.&#13;
Enfin, la construction des barrages de Manantali et de Diama ont permis une plus grande stabilite&#13;
des niveaux des eaux, el6ment favorable A la multiplication des bulins, en particulier B. globosus.&#13;

Les tendances epidemiologiques recentes dans les autres regions&#13;
31.    Dans les autres regions, I'endemie ne concerne que la bilharziose urinaire. Dans les&#13;
bassins de la Faleme et de l'Anambe et dans la zone des barrages anti-sel de la region de&#13;
Ziguinchor, l'endemie est stable sur les dix demieres annees. Mais le developpement des&#13;
programmes agricoles et d'irrigation font craindre une expansion rapide de l'endemie. Dans les&#13;
villages endemiques lies aux mares temporaires, 1'endemie est stable et s'etend peu aux villages&#13;
voisins. L'endemie est et reste tres localisee.&#13;
Les bilharzioses chez les animaux&#13;
32.    Les bilharzioses A S. haematobium et A S. mansoni ne sont pas des zoonoses. Les&#13;
animaux ne sont pas des h6tes definitifs pour les bilharzioses humaines au Senegal. Chez le&#13;
betail du Senegal, on ne rencontre que deux especes de schistosomes: Schistosoma bovis&#13;
principalement chez les bovins et S. curassoni qui parasite surtout les petits ruminants. L'etude&#13;
de I'infestation naturelle des h6tes definitifs et des mollusques h6tes intermediaires permet de&#13;
localiser ces schistosomes dans deux grandes zones: au Nord dans la Region de St Louis, et A&#13;
l'est et au sud-est dans les Regions de Tambacounda et de Kolda.&#13;
V.    MOYENS OPERATIONNELS POUR LA LUTTE CONTRE LEs BILHARZIOSES&#13;
Les examens diagnostiques&#13;
33.    La mise en evidence des oeufs dans les urines (S. haematobium) et dans les selles (S.&#13;
mcansoni) apporte la preuve diagnostique. Elle peut se faire, d'une part par un examen direct soit&#13;
de selles soit d'urine, d'autre part par un examen de Kato-Katz pour les selles ou par filtration&#13;
apres coloration pour les urines. A noter que l'observation d'oeufs ne peut se faire que dans la&#13;
sixieme semaine apres le contact infestant et que, par consequent, aucun diagnostic&#13;
parasitologique direct n'est possible en periode d' invasion. Un diagnostic presomptif de&#13;
bilharziose A S haematobium peut etre apporte par l'examen d'urine avec hemastix.&#13;
Les medicaments antibilharziens&#13;
34.    Les bilharzioses ont toujours ete difficiles A traiter car les premiers medicaments utilises&#13;
ont souvent e  tres toxiques et peu efficaces. Le niridazole ou Ambilhar a represente en son&#13;
temps un indeniable progres. II est maintenant largement supplante par le praziquantel,&#13;
l'oxamniquine et le metrifonate qui figurent tous sur la liste modele des mddicaments essentiels&#13;
de l'OMS.&#13;
Surveillance et contr61e des h6tes intermediaires&#13;
35.   II importe de rechercher les mollusques pour determiner les zones d'endemie, ainsi que&#13;
la densit6 et le taux d'infection par les cercaires, en vue de mettre en oeuvre un programme de&#13;
lutte et d'en assurer le suivi. Les prospections malacogiques englobent divers e1lments : le&#13;
nombre de mollusques et leur taux d'infestation, oeufs de mollusques, mollusques caches sous&#13;
terre ou dans lteau. Cet effort permettra d'etablir un plan d'action. Les principales methodes&#13;
d'6limination sont l'application d'un molluscicide et l'amenagement de l'environnement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Page 8 of 17&#13;
36.    Amenagement de l'Environnement. II est essentiel de modifier 1'environnement pour&#13;
eliminer les mollusques. Une telle entreprise est generalement couteuse et ne peut donc etre&#13;
r6alisee que sur des superficies limitees, conjointement a des investissements dans la production&#13;
agricole et la conservation de 1'eau. Les moyens de modification de l'environnement pour&#13;
contr6ler l'h6te intermediaire sont les suivants:&#13;
(a)    a) Le desherbage des bords d'eau. Son cout est faible si l'on considere la main&#13;
d'oeuvre de la population comme gratuite. Si son efficacite theorique est bonne, son&#13;
efficacite pratique depend d'une bonne organisation de la population et de la rigueur (les&#13;
herbes repoussent vite!).&#13;
(b)    b) La gestion des cours d'eau. Plusieurs moyens ont ete proposes mais ils sont&#13;
cofiteux ou bien ils demandent une grande organisation et une connaissance des&#13;
parametres malacologiques: (i) un changement brutal du niveau de l'eau etlou un&#13;
assechement temporaire qui entraine une dessication que ne supporte pas Biomphalaria&#13;
pfeifferi; (ii) la creation d'un courant fort qui detache les mollusques de leur point&#13;
d'ancrage ; (iii) couvrir les eaux ; et (iv) cimenter ou paver les bords et les parois des&#13;
canaux aux alentours des points de contact homme-eau (on pourrait penser a 200 ou 300&#13;
m).&#13;
37.    La lutte Chimique a la Niclosamide. Le coat du niclosamide pour le traitement d'un&#13;
m3 d'eau stagnante est egal a environ 19 FCFA (&lt; US$ 0.05) a la concentration de 0.5/1 million.&#13;
L'efficacite theorique est bonne, mais l'efficacite pratique depend: (i) de l'identification&#13;
correcte des sites de transmission; (ii) de l'identification correcte du cycle de reproduction de&#13;
l'h6te intermediaire (saisonalite); (iii) du respect des conditions d'application ; (iv) de la&#13;
coordination avec le traitement de la population ; et (v) des autres mesures de lutte contre l'hote&#13;
intermediaire. L'effet secondaire est que le traitement tue les poissons. En conclusion, cette&#13;
technique sera envisagee dans le cas de mares temporaires en vue d'une eradication ou bien dans&#13;
des sites de transmission intense bien delimites.&#13;
Les autres moyens de lutte&#13;
38.    Les mesures d'hygiene. L'objectif est de diminuer la contamination du milieu&#13;
aquatique. L'approvisionnement en eau salubre, I'assainissement et la protection des individus&#13;
revetent egalement une grande importance dans la lutte contre la bilharziose, car elles peuvent&#13;
bloquer une etape du cycle de vie du schistosome. Cependant, ces methodes ne sont pas faciles a&#13;
appliquer par suite du manque de ressources economiques pour les deux premieres, tandis que la&#13;
derniere pose des problemes de technologie, d'organisation et de gestion.&#13;
(a)    La latrinisation. L'efficacite theorique est bonne mais beaucoup plus faible en&#13;
pratique. Un programme de construction de latrines doit etre base sur une demande&#13;
de la population, etre precede d'une etude sur les coutumes et accompagne d'un&#13;
vaste programme de promotion.&#13;
(b)    L'adduction en eau potable. L'efficacite theorique et pratique est faible.&#13;
(c)    La creation d'espaces de contact (homme-eau) non contaminants. La strategie&#13;
est de diminuer le contact avec les eaux infestees par la creation au bord des canaux&#13;
&#13;

39.    L'IEC. L'objectif des campagnes d'IEC est d'informer les populations des risques de la&#13;
maladie, des signes de reconnaissances de la maladie, des changements de comportement pour&#13;
eviter l'infection et des moyens de prevention. Les populations cibles sont surtout les enfants et&#13;
les meres de famille.&#13;

VI.    ORGANISATION DE LA LUTTE CONTRE LES BILHARZIOSES&#13;
Service National des Grandes Endemies&#13;
40.    C'est au SNGE qu'appartient la responsabilite de la redaction et de l'operationalisation&#13;
du Programme National de Lutte contre les bilharzioses humaines. Le Service est decentralise et&#13;
est represente au niveau regional par les Secteurs des Grandes Endemies dont le personnel est&#13;
partie integrante de 1'6quipe medicale regionale, sous la direction du MCR. Le personnel affecte&#13;
au Secteur des Grandes Endemies est variable en fonction des besoins de la Region Medicale; il&#13;
comprend en general un medecin epidemiologiste qui seconde le MCR.&#13;
Les services de Sante Peripheriques&#13;
41.    Les activites de surveillance et de lutte relevant de la responsabilite du MSPAS sont&#13;
effectuees par les personnels de sante des districts et des Regions Medicales. Ces activites sont&#13;
planifiees dans le cadre des Plans de Developpement des Regions Medicales et des Districts.&#13;
Les Centres de Recherche&#13;
42.    Ils peuvent etre soit nationaux, telles que la Faculte des Sciences et Techniques et la&#13;
Faculte de Medecine et de Pharmacie de l'Universite Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar ou le&#13;
Laboratoire National de Recherche Veterinaire, soit etrangers telles que l'ORSTOM, l'Institut&#13;
Pasteur, les universites d'Anvers et de Leyden. Ils sont, pour le SNGE des p6les d'excellence&#13;
qui peuvent le conseiller sur les modifications des strategies de lutte. Ces Centres menent des&#13;

Cas de la Region de St Louis&#13;
43.    L'epidemie recente de bilharziose dfie A la construction du barrage de Diama a focalise&#13;
l'attention du monde scientifique et des bailleurs de fonds sur la region de St Louis. Un projet de&#13;
recherche, le projet ESPOIR, a ete cree en 1991 et a demarre ses activites en 1992. Un&#13;
laboratoire de recherche, le Centre d'Investigations Biologiques, et un laboratoire&#13;
d'immunologie cellulaire ont ete crees A la meme epoque, respectivement A Richard-Toll et A&#13;
Sor. Une reflexion a et entamee pour preciser les r6les respectifs de chacun des organismes et&#13;
des differents services de sante dans la lutte contre les maladies endemiques, en particulier dans&#13;
le cadre du Programme National de Lutte contre les Bilharzioses Humaines.&#13;
44.    Le programme ESPOIR est un programme de recherche et de lutte integree sur les&#13;
bilharzioses dans la region de St Louis. Sa Direction est assuree par le MCR, la direction&#13;
technique dtant assuree par le medecin-chef du Secteur des Grandes Endemies assiste d'un&#13;
medecin epidemiologiste.&#13;
45.    Le Centre d'Investigation Biologique (CIB) se confond avec le laboratoire du Centre&#13;
de Sante de Richard-Toll et est sous la responsabilite du medecin-chef de district. Le laboratoire&#13;
d'immunologie cellulaire de Sor depend du Secteur des Grandes Endemies et releve de l'autorite&#13;
du medecin-chef du Secteur des Grandes Endemies.&#13;
VII. STRATEGIE DE LA LUTTE CONTRE LA BILHARZIOSE URINAIRE DANS LE CADRE DU&#13;
PROJET&#13;
Objectif General&#13;
46.    Le projet, a pour but de reduire la morbidite et la prevalence de la bilharziose urinaire&#13;
dans toutes les regions du Senegal A l'exception des regions de Dakar (oui il n'y a pas de cas de&#13;
bilharziose) et de St Louis (ofu la lutte fait l'objet du programme ESPOIR), et, dans certaines&#13;
zones, d'en interrompre la transmission. Ses objectifs specifiques sont les suivants:&#13;
(a)    reduire globalement de 40 % la prevalence de la bilharziose urinaire au sein de la&#13;
population;&#13;
(b)    eliminer les mollusques infectes dans les mares temporaires.&#13;
Approche&#13;
47.    Les strategies techniques retenues pour realiser ces objectifs ont ete elaborees par le&#13;
SNGE du MSPAS, avec I'aide du Comite consultatif d'experts pour la lutte contre la bilharziose.&#13;
Elles varient selon le niveau d'endemicite de la zone ou elles doivent etre appliquees. Trois&#13;
niveaux d'endemicite ont ete definis en fonction du taux d'infestation des villageois, et des&#13;
mesures techniques differentes sont prevues pour chacun de ces niveaux. Les activites&#13;
specifiques entreprises dans chaque zone doivent etre en conformite avec les strategies&#13;
techniques correspondant au niveau d'endemicite de cette zone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Page 11 of 17&#13;
48.     Les principales m6thodes seront la chimiotherapie pour la lutte contre la morbidite, et&#13;
l'application dans les mares temporaires infestees de molluscicide pour l'e1imination des&#13;
mollusques. Afin de minimiser la pollution de l'environnement, le programme de lutte contre la&#13;
bilharziose urinaire fera exclusivement usage de la niclosamide, qui est un molluscicide&#13;
ecologiquement acceptable. Au cas ou l'Organisation Mondiale de la Sante (OMS) approuverait&#13;
l'usage a grande echelle d'autres molluscicides, il pourra etre envisage d'autoriser leur utilisation&#13;
dans le cadre du programme national de lutte contre la bilharziose. Sous les conseils du SNGE,&#13;
dans le cadre de leurs projets propres, d'autres organismes publics pourront entreprendre la&#13;
construction de latrines, I'amenagement des berges des canaux d'irrigation, I'adduction d'eau qui&#13;
beneficieront en partie au programme de lutte contre la bilharziose. Les aspects de ces projets de&#13;
construction relatifs a la lutte contre la bilharziose devront etre pris en compte par chaque&#13;
organisme public concerne et ils devront faire l'objet d'une etroite coordination avec le SNGE et&#13;
le Secteur des Grandes Endemies de la region.&#13;

Strategie&#13;
49.    Les objectifs specifiques de la strategie consistent A:&#13;
(a)    reduire la morbidite et la prevalence de la bilharziose urinaire dans les zones de&#13;
forte endemicite, c'est-a-dire ou la prevalence est superieure a 50% chez les enfants&#13;
de 7 A 14 ans;&#13;
(b)    contr6ler la prevalence dans les zones de moyenne endemicite, c'est-A-dire oui la&#13;
prevalence est comprise entre 20 et 50 % chez les enfants de 7 a 14 ans;&#13;
(c)    arreterer la transmission dans les zones de faible endemicite, c'est-a-dire ou la&#13;
prevalence est inferieure A 20% chez les enfants de 7 A 14 ans.&#13;
50.    Les zones d'endemicite des 8 regions (toutes les r6gions A l'exception des regions de&#13;
Dakar et de St Louis) participant au programme ont et classees en fonction des taux de&#13;
prevalence dans la population humaine (enquete nationale de 1995 et 96 sur les bilharzioses)&#13;
dans les divers villages. Les strategies adoptees pour chacun des trois niveaux d'endemicite&#13;
seront les suivantes.&#13;
51.    Zones de forte endemicite. L'objectif consiste A reduire la morbidite et la prevalence de&#13;
la bilharziose urinaire. Les methodes suivantes seront employees: i) chimiotherapie de masses&#13;
sans depistage par des diagnostics individuels, de toute la population y compris des enfants de 7&#13;
A 14 ans (dans les ecoles) en cas de bilharziose A S. haematobium; ii) mesures limitees&#13;
d'elimination des mollusques par l'application du molluscicide niclosamide, completees par des&#13;
mesures d'amenagement de l'environnement dans les cas appropries qui seront definis par les&#13;
Secteurs des Grandes Endemies.&#13;
52.    La chimiotherapie de masse se fera comme suit:&#13;
(a)    dans les trois premieres annees du programme, les individus ages de 6 A 60 ans (soit&#13;
approximativement 80 % de la population totale) recevront chaque anne un&#13;
traitement de praziquantel, le taux de couverture prevu etant d'environ 90 %.&#13;
(b)    dans les quatrieme et cinquifeme annees du programme, le traitement dependra des&#13;
resultats du sondage statistique systematique qui sera effectue A la fin de la troisieme&#13;
annee. Dans les endroits ou la prevalence sera encore egale ou superieure a 50 %,&#13;
tous les individus seront traites (sans depistage individuel) tandis que les zones oil la&#13;
prevalence aura ete ramenee A moins de 50 % seront considerees comme des zones&#13;
de moyenne endemicite.&#13;
53.    L'elimination des mollusques, responsables de la bilharziose urinaire, sera envisagee&#13;
apres que des recensements aient ete effectues chaque annee, au printemps ou A I'automne, dans&#13;
les zones out le potentiel de transmission est eleve. Des amenagements limites seront apportes a&#13;
1'environnement dans les cas appropries.&#13;
54.    Zones de moyenne endemicite. L'objectif consiste A lutter contre la prevalence. Les&#13;
methodes suivantes seront employees:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 13 of 17&#13;
(a)    Chimiotherapie de la population humaine. Toute la population entre 6 et 19 ans&#13;
sera traitee au praziquantel. La population des enfants de 7 a 14 ans sera examin6e&#13;
chaque annee.&#13;
(b)    Elimination des mollusques. Dans les premiere, troisieme et cinquieme annees du&#13;
programme, toutes les zones autour des villages ayant un potentiel de transmission&#13;
eleve et dont le traitement par molluscicide a ete juge approprie feront l'objet d'une&#13;
enquete par sondage. Celles ou il s'avere que des mollusques sont infectes (au&#13;
broyage) seront traitees par l'application d'un molluscicide. Dans les deuxieme,&#13;
troisieme et quatrieme annees du programme, les zones se caract6risant par un&#13;
potentiel de transmission eleve feront l'objet d'une enquete par sondage.&#13;
55.    Zones de faible endemicite. L'objectif consiste a arreter la transmission dans les cas&#13;
appropries. Les methodes suivantes seront employees:&#13;
(a)    La chimiotherapie de masse. L'ensemble des enfants de 5 a 19 ans sera examine&#13;
tous les deux ans (c'est-a-dire dans les premiere, troisieme et cinquieme ann6es).&#13;
Ceux pour lesquels la reaction sera positive recevront un traitement (soit&#13;
approximativement 3 % des enfants testes). En outre, des tests serologiques seront&#13;
administres aux groupes ci-apres, qui recevront un traitement en cas de besoin&#13;
(a) individus soupconnes ou depistes passivement dans les Postes de Sante, les&#13;
Centres de Sante et les h6pitaux; et (b) membres de la famille, voisins ou collegues&#13;
d'individus infectes.&#13;
(b)    Elimination des mollusques. Les zones infestees appropriees seront traitees a I'aide&#13;
d'un molluscicide, ou feront l'objet d'amenagements appropries et limites de&#13;
1'environnement.&#13;
VIII.  LE SYSTEME DE SURVEILLANCE DE LA BILHARZIOSE URINAIRE&#13;
56.    La surveillance des changements epiddmiologiques et de l'evolution de la bilharziose&#13;
urinaire dans les zones couvertes par le projet durant la mise en oeuvre de la strategie du projet&#13;
fournira les elements necessaires pour ajuster et ameliorer les stratdgies de lutte au niveau des&#13;
villages administratifs.&#13;
57.    Le travail de surveillance sera organise et coordonne par le SNGE et les Regions&#13;
Medicales. Le SNGE sera charge de la planification, des directives techniques et de l'analyse des&#13;
donnees. Les activites de surveillance sur le terrain seront executees par les equipes de district et&#13;
les equipes de la Region Medicale.&#13;
Indices et Techniques de Surveillance&#13;
58.    Pour la surveillance de la maladie chez les populations humaines, les indices suivants&#13;
feront l'objet d'un suivi: (a) la prevalence et l'intensite de l'infestation; (b) l'incidence des cas&#13;
aigus et graves de bilharziose; et (c) les donnees sur les infestations chez les populations&#13;
migrantes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 14 of 17&#13;
59.    Les techniques de surveillance seront les suivantes. On se servira des hemastix pour&#13;
l'examen des urines humaines. On suivra les methodes standard du manuel de lutte contre la&#13;
bilharziose (A publier) du MSPAS pour les examens des mollusques et pour l'examen clinique&#13;
des populations humaines. Des donnees sur les cas aigus et avances de bilharziose seront&#13;
recueillies A l'aide du systeme standard de notification des cas de maladie.&#13;
Methodes de Surveillance&#13;
60.    A partir des resultats des enquetes de prevalence de 1995 et de 1996, trois niveaux&#13;
d'endemicite ont et definis pour la population de 7 A 14 ans: prevalence &gt;50 %, prevalence&#13;
comprise entre 20 et 50 %, et prevalence &lt;20 %. Ces trois niveaux servent de fondement A la&#13;
strategie de lutte. L'enquete fournit les donnees de reference pour la surveillance. Sur la base du&#13;
nombre total de villages situes dans les trois zones d'endemicite, l'on selectionnera chaque ann6e&#13;
pour y effectuer une surveillance 3 % des villages des zones de forte endemicite, I % de ceux&#13;
des zones de moyenne endemicite et I % de ceux des zones de faible endemicite.&#13;
61.    Dans les zones de forte et moyenne endemicite, I'on examinera, dans des villages&#13;
s6lectionnes, les urines de 500 individus ages de 3 A 60 ans en procedant A un sondage par&#13;
grappes. (Les donnees sur les enfants de 3 a 5 ans seront analysees separement dans le cadre de&#13;
la surveillance de la transmission-voir plus loin.)&#13;
62.    Dans les zones de faible endemicite, 1'examen portera sur les enfants de 7 A 14 ans et les&#13;
classes scolaires serviront A constituer les grappes.&#13;
63.    Selon la population des villages selectionnes, au moins 33 % de la population migrante&#13;
seront contr6les.&#13;
Surveillance des Mollusques&#13;
64.    Les densites de mollusques et leurs taux d'infestation seront evalues comme suit dans les&#13;
differentes zones d'endemicite:&#13;
(a)   Zones de forte endemicite. Dans chacun des villages faisant l'objet d'une&#13;
surveillance, on examinera un minimum de 500 m2 et pas moins de&#13;
5 000 mollusques.&#13;
(b)   Zones de moyenne endemicite. Dans les sites a fort potentiel de transmission aux&#13;
alentours des villages couverts par les operations de surveillance, I'on examinera un&#13;
minimum de 300 m2 et de 5 000 mollusques.&#13;
(c)   Zones de faible endemicite. Les operations ne seront menees qu'autour des habitats&#13;
de gasteropodes connus ou potentiels; l'on examinera un minimum de 200 m2. Si la&#13;
densite de mollusques est faible et que l'on collecte moins de 5 000 individus, ceux-&#13;
ci seront tous examines.&#13;
1/ Des etudes sur la morbidite au niveau communautaire seront egalement effectuees dans le cadre des recherches operationnelles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 15 of 17&#13;
(d)   Enfants scolarises. Au niveau des villages administratifs des les zones de forte et&#13;
moyenne endemicite, des 6chantillons aleatoires d'urines d'enfants de 10 a 12 ans&#13;
seront preleves dans les troisieme et cinquieme annees du programme et examines.&#13;
(Pour calculer la prevalence de la maladie dans l'ensemble de la population, on&#13;
utilisera un facteur de multiplication approprie etabli a partir des resultats de&#13;
l'enquete nationale de 1989.) En depit de la petite taille de l'echantillon, cette&#13;
approche presente plusieurs avantages: (i) ce groupe d'age se caracterisant par une&#13;
forte prevalence, les etudes parasitologiques peuvent donner des resultats probants;&#13;
(ii) les enfants cooperent facilement; (iii) les resultats refletent mieux I'end6micit6&#13;
d'un village que les donnees obtenues pour des adultes mobiles; (iv) les resultats&#13;
obtenus permettront d'operer un recoupement avec les resultats de la strategie de&#13;
surveillance aux niveaux national et provincial.&#13;
Surveillance de la Transmission&#13;
65.    Les donnees resultant des activites ci-dessus de surveillance de la maladie indiqueront&#13;
1'effet direct de la chimiotherapie (de masse ou selective) sur la prevalence et le degre&#13;
d'infestation de la population humaine, qui influent indirectement sur la morbidite. L'effet&#13;
secondaire de la chimiotherapie, a savoir la reduction de la transmission, sera evalue chez le&#13;
groupe d'age des enfants de 3 a 5 ans non traites. Dans la premiere annee du programme, ce&#13;
groupe aura une faible prevalence et un faible degre d'infestation; a mesure que la chimiotherapie&#13;
fera sentir ses effets au niveau de la transmission, ces parametres de l'infestation devraient&#13;
diminuer. Si la chimioth6rapie permet d'arreter la transmission dans une zone, la prevalence&#13;
chez les enfants de 3 a 5 ans sera nulle dans la cinquieme annee du programme.&#13;
IX.   RECHERCHE OPERATIONNELLE&#13;
66.    Si une strategie de base a ete definie pour la lutte contre la bilharziose dans les zones de&#13;
forte, moyenne et faible endemicite, des problemes surgiront inevitablement dans le cours de la&#13;
mise en oeuvre et des recherches seront donc necessaires pour formuler les ajustements et&#13;
ameliorations a apporter aux techniques de lutte dans les diverses situations epidemiologiques.&#13;
67.    Les recherches menees durant la mise en oeuvre du projet porteront sur les principaux&#13;
themes prioritaires suivants:&#13;
(a)    Test(s) de diagnostic le(s) plus adequat(s) pour detecter une resurgence de la&#13;
transmission lorsque la prevalence est apparemment nulle. Si le test de precipitation&#13;
peri-ovulaire, le test d'hemaglutination indirecte et le test ELISA ont une sensibilite&#13;
specifique similaire pour les infestations etablies (chroniques), leur utilisation en cas&#13;
d'infestation a un stade precoce, legres et eventuellement limitee a un seul sexe a&#13;
besoin d'etre clarifie.&#13;
(b)    Si les enfants sont generalement consideres comme un groupe ideal pour les&#13;
operations de surveillance, une fois que l'on est parvenu a un controle effectif dans&#13;
les zones ou l'infestation peut resulter d'un risque professionnel ou domestique, il&#13;
peutt tre plus approprie de suivre d'autres groupes d'age (de 25 a 40 ans). Le groupe&#13;
optimal peut varier en fonction de la situation epidemiologique et des conditions&#13;
socioeconomiques. De meme, il convient de choisir des techniques de diagnostic et&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 16 of 17&#13;
des groupes d'age indicateurs appropries dans les autres zones d'endemicite au fur et&#13;
A mesure que la prevalence diminue.&#13;
(c)    L'application d'un molluscicide complete la chimiotherapie. La niclosamide est&#13;
couteuse, des recherches devront etre menees pour s'assurer que l'on utilise la&#13;
methode d'application la plus rentable. II convient de comparer l'efficacite des&#13;
pulverisateurs mecaniques et manuels pour diffuser le produit A la dose desiree, et&#13;
d'etudier les differents types de buse.&#13;
(d)    Les formulations de niclosamide a liberation lente et leur durabilite sur la boue&#13;
sechee devront etre evaluees. II sera necessaire egalement d'evaluer les nouveaux&#13;
molluscicides prometteurs et d'en tester la toxicite.&#13;
(e)    La sensibilite actuelle des bulins A la niclosamide doit servir de reference au cas ou&#13;
des signes de resistance apparaitraient A l'avenir. Au besoin, des etudes seront&#13;
consacrees A la dynamique des populations de mollusques et l'on continuera de&#13;
mettre en oeuvre des methodes pour prevenir leur propagation.&#13;
(f)    Apres une formation approfondie aux nouvelles methodes de lutte standardisees, il&#13;
faudra effectuer des etudes au niveau communautaire afin d'etablir la &lt;&lt; norme )&gt;&#13;
d'infestation pour les differents groupes d'age, pour la population masculine et pour&#13;
la population feminine dans les differentes zones epidemiologiques.&#13;
(g)    Des etudes sur la morbidite au niveau communautaire devront etre effectuees dans&#13;
les differentes zones epidemiologiques afin de clarifier la relation entre la prevalence&#13;
(et le degre) de l'infestation et les sympt6mes et signes de la maladie.&#13;
68.    Des recherches operationnelles devront egalement etre consacrees A des themes lies&#13;
specifiquement a la mise en oeuvre du projet. Les themes principaux seront les suivants:&#13;
(a)    Suivi des elements des trois composantes principales de la strategie de&#13;
lutte: chimiotherapie, elimination des mollusques et education sanitaire. Ce suivi&#13;
est indispensable pour assurer que chaque composante contribue au maximum au&#13;
projet.&#13;
(b)    Chimiotherapie. Celle-ci constitue le fondement de toute la strategie de controle de&#13;
la morbidite. Le but est d'administrer le traitement approprie (chimiotherapie de&#13;
masse ou selective) au plus grand nombre possible d'individus. Les donnees&#13;
suivantes devront donc etre enregistrees au niveau des villages : (i) identite des&#13;
individus refusant de cooperer (refusant de faire examiner leurs urines ou d'etre&#13;
traitds) et des individus non trait6s (pour une raison justifi6e) ; (ii) effet du&#13;
programme de chimiotherapie par groupe d'age et par sexe (si possible egalement&#13;
par categorie professionnelle) - ces donnees seront utilisees pour cibler les actions&#13;
d'education sanitaire sur les individus ou groupes appropries; (iii) nombre de&#13;
villages devant etre examines ou traites sur une periode donnee, et couverture&#13;
effective.&#13;
(c)    Elimination des mollusques. La dimension des habitats de mollusques devant faire&#13;
l'objet d'enquetes par sondage et d'applications de molluscicide dans les differentes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 17of17&#13;
zones d'endemicite est indiquee dans la strategie de lutte. A partir des donnees&#13;
enregistrees sur le terrain, il sera important d'etudier la couverture effective des&#13;
operations et, au cas ou celle-ci serait insuffisante, d'en determiner les raisons.&#13;
(d)    Education sanitaire. Les objectifs a court terme de la composante d'education&#13;
sanitaire varieront selon les zones d'endemicite. Des objectifs seront definis au&#13;
debut de chaque annee et des dossiers seront constitues sur toutes les activites. Au&#13;
cas oii les objectifs ne seraient pas atteints, il conviendra d'en determiner les raisons&#13;
et de prendre des mesures pour redresser la situation.&#13;
(e)    Suivi permanent. Si le programme de surveillance du projet de lutte doit etre&#13;
organise et coordonne par le SNGE et les Secteurs des Grandes Endemies, les&#13;
equipes d'enqueteurs sur le terrain devraient examiner les dossiers des examens&#13;
d'urines dans le cas de la bilharziose a S. haematobium afin de detecter rapidement&#13;
les zones localisees ou la lutte ne serait pas aussi efficace que prevu. II est possible&#13;
qu'il ne soit pas possible de detecter ces zones lorsque l'on combine les resultats de&#13;
plusieurs villages; il importe donc d'examiner les resultats de petites unit6s locales&#13;
de population. II faudra proceder a une analyse des resultats par sexe, par groupe&#13;
d1'ge et, le cas echeant, par emploi. Les equipes d'enqueteurs devront etre&#13;
encouragees A analyser eux-memes la prevalence et le degre d'infestation et a suivre&#13;
l'6volution annuelle de la situation.&#13;
(f)    Contr6le de qualite. Surtout dans les zones de moyenne endemicite oui les urines&#13;
doivent etre examinees avant l'administration d'un traitement (chimiotherapie&#13;
selective), le contr6le de qualite des examens microscopiques revet un caractere&#13;
essentiel. Le travail des techniciens doit etre v6rifie.&#13;

REPUBLIQUE DU SENEGAL&#13;
PROJET DE LUTTE CONTRE LES MALADIES ENDEMIQUES&#13;
L'ONCHOCERCOSE&#13;
I.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Le Senegal fait partie de l'extension Ouest du programme de lute contre l'onchocercose&#13;
en Afrique de l'Ouest (OCP) depuis 1986. Les enquetes effectuees avant le demarrage des&#13;
activites du programme ont permis de delimiter la partie Senegalaise de l'extension Ouest du&#13;
programme. Au total sept (7) arrondissements sont concernes dont six (6) dans la region de&#13;
Tambacounda et un (1) dans la region de Kolda. Cette partie orientale du Senegal oui sevit&#13;
l'endemie onchocerquienne, couvre une superficie d'environ 40,000 km2. La population totale&#13;
exposee etait estimee au debut du programme A 198,000 habitants, repartie dans les vallees de la&#13;
Faleme et de la Gambie. La population vivant en zone hyperendemique est estimee A 23,000&#13;
habitants, soit 11,61% de la population exposee.&#13;
II.    HISTORIQUE Du PROGRAMME OCP Au SENEGAL&#13;
2.    Au Senegal, seule la morbidite liee A la maladie onchocerquienne est contr6lee; il n'y a&#13;
pas de contr6le de la transmission de la maladie comme c'est le cas dans les autres zones du&#13;
programme. Le contr6le de la morbidite est base sur la distribution annuelle de l'ivermectine.&#13;
En l'absence d'un impact sur la transmission (dans l'etat de nos connaissances actuelles), cette&#13;
distribution devrait donc se poursuivre sur au moins les vingt (20) prochaines annees. Etant&#13;
donnee la duree prevue de ce traitement, la perennite et la rentabilite de la distribution sont les&#13;
objectifs principaux de la strategie de distribution adoptee.&#13;
3.    Le processus de devolution, dejA entame au Senegal, a pour objectif de transferer la&#13;
responsabilite de cette distribution aux nationaux. La recherche d'une perennite et d'une&#13;
rationalisation des ressources humaines, materielles et financieres a conduit le programme OCP&#13;
A conseiller une "distribution communautaire" par les agents de sante communautaires, au lieu&#13;
d'une "distribution A grande echelle" par une equipe nationale mobile. L'experience de&#13;
distribution communautaire en cours dans 4 districts au Senegal souleve une question qui n'a pas&#13;
e  encore resolue, la prime de motivation des agents de sante communautaire.&#13;
4.    La distribution A grande echelle de l'ivermectine commencee par l'OCP depuis 1988&#13;
dans la zone hyperendemique du departement de Kedougou couvre environ 157 villages du&#13;
district de Kedougou repartis entre les bassins fluviaux de la Faleme (37 villages) et de la&#13;
Gambie (120 villages). Elle est assuree par l'equipe nationale (coordinateur national, assistant&#13;
administratif, operateur radio, 8 techniciens, 3 chauffeurs et un gardien - personnel appartenant&#13;
au Secteur des Grandes Endemies de Tambacounda A l'exception du Coordinateur national)&#13;
basee A Tambacounda avec le soutien logistique (voitures, carburant) et financier (sur-salaires du&#13;
coordinateur, de I'assistant administratif et de l'operateur radio, salaires de trois chauffeurs et&#13;
d'un gardien, perdiems pendant les campagnes de distribution) de l'OCP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5.     En 1994, grace a l'appui financier (carburant et maintenance des vehicules et motos) de&#13;
l'OMS dans le cadre du programme AFROPOC et au soutien financier (perdiems pour&#13;
supervision au medecins-chefs des region de Kolda et Tambacounda, pour les deux superviseurs&#13;
des deux regions, pour le chef epidemiologie/entomologie de l'equipe nationale base A au&#13;
Secteur des Grandes Endemies de Tambacounda, pour les 4 medecins-chefs des 4 districts et&#13;
pour leur superviseurs, primes pour les infirmiers-chefs de postes des 4 districts concernes,&#13;
primes pour les chauffeurs) de l'OPC, le traitement communautaire A l'ivermectine a demarre&#13;
dans certains arrondissements des districts de Kedougou, Goudiry, Tambacounda et Velingara.&#13;
La population exposee dans la zone ou a demarre le traitement communautaire est estimee en&#13;
1995 A 78,281 habitants repartis dans 299 villages et la commune de Kedougou. La distribution&#13;
communautaire de l'ivermectine est assuree par les agents de sante communautaire ou&#13;
distributeurs, sous la supervision et le contr6le des infirmiers chefs de poste. Au cours de&#13;
l'annee 1995, le traitement communautaire a pu couvrir 58,881 habitants.&#13;
6.     En 1996, dans le cadre de la devolution du programme de lutte contre l'onchocercose, il&#13;
etait prevu que les cent cinquante sept (157) villages des bassins fluviaux de la Faleme et de la&#13;
Gambie, qui sont encore sous traitement a grande echelle, seraient couverts par le traitement&#13;
communautaire. En fait, 14 villages du bassin de la Faleme feront de la distribution&#13;
communautaire; les autres villages manquant d'agents de sante communautaire alphabetises.&#13;
Dans le bassin de la Gambie, la campagne de novembre 96 permettra d'identifier et de former les&#13;
agents de sante communautaire alphabetises qui seront responsables de la distribution&#13;
communautaire.&#13;
7.     Calendrier annuel des activites. La distribution a grande echelle se fait lors de deux&#13;
campagnes, une en avril qui dure 25 jours et qui couvre les deux bassins de la Faleme et de la&#13;
Gambie, et une en novembre qui dure 15 jours et qui n'interesse que le bassin de la Gambie.&#13;
Dans le bassin de la Gambie la distribution d'ivernectine est faite deux fois par an en raison&#13;
d'une forte endemicite. Le dossier de demande d'ivermectine au producteur Merck est assur6e&#13;
par l'OCP. Les m6dicaments sont recuperes par l'assistant administratif du Secteur des Grandes&#13;
Endemies de Tambacounda A Bamako au Mali.&#13;
III.   PROJET DE LUTTE CONTRE L'ONCHOCERCOSE&#13;
8.     Objectifs general et specifiques. L'objectif general est d'eliminer le risque de cecite&#13;
due A l'onchocercose dans la zone du programme pendant les 20 A venir. Les objectifs&#13;
specifiques sont les suivants: (i) etendre sur l'ensemble de la zone la distribution de&#13;
l'ivermectine par les agents de sante communautaires; (ii) traiter 90% de la population eligible&#13;
dans les bassins de la Faleme et de la Gambie ; et (iii) mettre en place un systeme de surveillance&#13;
epidemiologique active afin de mesurer tous les 3 ans, le taux d'incidence de l'onchocercose&#13;
dans les 24 villages sentinelles dans les vallees de la Faleme et de la Gambie (8 villages par an).&#13;
9.     La distribution de l'ivermectine. L'ivermectine est offerte gratuitement par le&#13;
fabricant Merck Sharp &amp; Dome sur presentation d'un dossier technique. L'elaboration de ce&#13;
dossier releve de la responsabilite du SNGE. La reception de l'ivermectine et son acheminement&#13;
jusqu'aux Secteurs des Grandes Endemies de Tambacounda et de Kolda - loges dans les Regions&#13;
M6dicales - sont sous la responsabilite du SNGE (possibilite d'acheminement par la PNA&#13;
moyennant finances). Les equipes de district vont chercher a la a la Pharmacie Regionale ou a Ia&#13;
Region Medicale (RM) les quantites d'ivermectine commandees. Les infirmiers chefs de poste&#13;
vont chercher l'ivermectine au niveau du district et distribuent aux agents de sante&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

communautaire les quantit6s necessaires A la distribution dans chaque village. Les agents de&#13;
sante communautaire distribuent l'ivermectine une fois par an A la population eligible du village.&#13;
10.    La "chaine" du monitoring de cette distribution est la suivante: (i) les agents de sante&#13;
communautaire font un rapport apres chaque distribution d'ivermectine ; (ii) les rapports sont&#13;
regroupes par l'infirmier chef de poste qui les transmet A l'equipe medicale du district ; (iii) au&#13;
niveau du district, les informations sont entrees dans le SIG informatise ; (iv) 1'equipe medicale&#13;
du district et l'equipe du Secteur des Grandes Endemies analysent les donnees et les indicateurs;&#13;
et (v) le niveau central du SNGE est tenu informe, en temps reel, des activites et des indicateurs&#13;
de suivi par l'intermediaire du reseau informatique du SIG.&#13;
11.    Surveillance epidemiologique active. La surveillance epidemiologique des vingt&#13;
quatre (24) villages sentinelles tous les 3 ans, ce qui veut dire la surveillance de 8 villages par an,&#13;
relevera de la responsabilite du Secteur des Grandes Endemies de la RM de Tambacounda. Le&#13;
temps consacre A cette tache par le Secteur ne devrait pas exceder 4 semaines. Les resultats sont&#13;
entres dans le SIG informatise soit au niveau du district le plus proche soit au niveau de la RM.&#13;
Les personnels necessaires A cette surveillance epidemiologique active devrait comporter un&#13;
m6decin-6pid6miologiste forme A l'entree informatique de donnees qui sera le m6decin du&#13;
Secteur des Grandes Endemies, trois techniciens en parasitologie charges des prelevements et&#13;
des analyses, et un chauffeur. Cette equipe appartient au Secteur des Grandes Endemies. Les&#13;
ressources materielles et logistiques sont un vehicule 404, et le matdriel technique de&#13;
prelevement.&#13;
12.    Surveillance passive. Elle est faites par les PS et les CS qui reportent leurs resultats&#13;
dans le systeme d'information SIG.&#13;
13.    L'equipe de district fait une premiere analyse des resultats traites par le SIG soit au&#13;
niveau de la surveillance epidemiologique passive, soit au niveau de la surveillance&#13;
epidemiologique active. Les possibles attitudes de reponse sont discutees avec le Secteur et le&#13;
niveau central si besoin.&#13;
14.    Responsabilites du niveau central du SNGE. Dans le cadre du programme de lutte&#13;
contre l'onchocercose, elles sont: (i) le suivi des activites et le dialogue avec les differents&#13;
intervenants par l'intermediaire du SIG informatise ; (ii) la conception et l'organisation des&#13;
campagnes d'IEC ; (iii) la conception et l'organisation des modules de "formation continue"&#13;
dans le souci extr8me d'integration avec les "formations continues" concernant les autres&#13;
programmes de lutte ; (iv) la conception et l'organisation des enquetes jugees necessaires A la&#13;
poursuite du programme ; et (v) les relations avec les partenaires internationaux.&#13;
15.    Les ressources humaines. Les ressources humaines des Secteurs des Grandes&#13;
Endemies, ainsi que les besoins en formation, sont etudiees globalement, et non pas programme&#13;
par programme, dans l'annexe sur le renforcement institutionnel du SNGE.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL&#13;
ENDEMIC DISEASE CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
HEALTH MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM&#13;
I.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    For several years, MSPAS has had the objective of developing a management information&#13;
system. The user-friendliness and affordability of new technologies would make it possible to install a&#13;
real-time computerized information system linking the medical districts and regions and MSPAS's&#13;
central units.&#13;
II.    BACKGROUND&#13;
2.    Historical Background. Changes in the health information system were undertaken in 1986,&#13;
and have focused on the management of health services, the title used being Systeme d'information ai des&#13;
fins de gestion (SIG: "Management Information System). This system includes information relating to&#13;
the following areas: (i) demographics; (ii) financial management; (iii) implementation of health services&#13;
and programs; (iv) morbidity; (v) mortality. From 1986 to 1993, efforts were concentrated on the&#13;
standardization of the various media (i.e. modules, records, and reports) and health indicators, and on&#13;
testing the system in 10 districts. In 1994 and 1995, the system was installed in the remaining districts,&#13;
with support from UNICEF, USAID, and the Italian Cooperation Agency.&#13;
3.    At the beginning of 1994, while the system was being established in all districts, MSPAS&#13;
launched a computerization process, to include: (i) use of the GESIB software program for processing&#13;
monitoring data relating to Bamako Initiative activities, with technical support from UNICEF; (ii) use of&#13;
the SANTE software program for processing some of the information system data relating to health posts&#13;
and health centers, with technical support from the Italian Cooperation Agency; (iii) the digital&#13;
cartographic representation of certain indicators for the establishment of a geographic information&#13;
system (GIS) in the river region, with technical support from WHO; (iv) indicators for monitoring&#13;
implementation of the family planning policy, with technical support from USAID; (v) preparation of a&#13;
hospital information system, with technical support from the French Cooperation Agency. In addition,&#13;
MSPAS has developed a maintenance information system.&#13;
4.    Evaluation of the Existing Information Systems. The various health information systems are&#13;
based on different media (i.e. paper, particular software programs, or computer packages). They do not&#13;
all have the same purposes, but the functionalities of the various software programs, and the data they are&#13;
designed to manage, often contain redundancies. These information systems are not truly interactive,&#13;
because they were not designed for a network environment that provides for data exchange,&#13;
consolidation, and distribution functions. A detailed evaluation of each of the software programs can be&#13;
found in the Implementation Manual for the project.&#13;
5.    Evaluation of Available Hardware. Because of the diversity of projects and donors involved in&#13;
the Senegalese health sector, the hardware now available in the regions and districts is very mixed, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
this is reflected in the variety of makes, operating systems, and configurations. There are five different&#13;
makes (Dell, Compaq, Apple, NEC, and Olivetti). two operating systems (Mac and DOS), and many&#13;
different configurations. The configurations of most of the PCs would allow them to be networked, but&#13;
the mixture of makes and operating systems present problems not only of communications and&#13;
compatibility, but also of maintenance.&#13;
6.    Evaluation of the Telecommunications Infrastructure. Societe Nationale des&#13;
Tel6communications du Senegal provides the following three types of service that would support&#13;
implementation of a computer network covering the medical districts and regions and MSPAS: the&#13;
SENPAC network, dedicated data transmission lines (lignes specialisees de transmission des donn&amp;es -&#13;
LSTD), and the switched telephone network (Reseau Telephonique Commute - RTC).&#13;
III.   DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIRED INFORMATION SYSTEM&#13;
Technical Architecture Selected&#13;
7.    Figure 1 shows the MSPAS architecture. For a telecommunications network, the RTC seems the&#13;
best choice from a technical and (more particularly) economic viewpoint. The ability to establish a link&#13;
between any two computers at any given time, with pricing based on connect time, offers major&#13;
advantages for the project. The only constraints arise from the quality of telephone lines in some rural&#13;
areas; nevertheless, the application of appropriate hardware and software solutions should serve to make&#13;
communications and data transfer more reliable until a totally digital national telecommunications&#13;
network can be established.&#13;
Organization of Data Exchange&#13;
8.    The proposed solution would achieve the following objectives: (a) interconnectability of&#13;
computers in the medical districts and regions and MSPAS, as required; (b) the possibility of automatic&#13;
remote file collection (such files consisting of health data from the various information systems, such as&#13;
SIG, GESIB, etc.), transmission of files to remote terminals (i.e. feedback data from the Ministry or&#13;
the region, versions of software programs, parameter tables, etc.), remote maintenance of network&#13;
terminals (i.e. the provision of remote technical assistance), and electronic messaging among the&#13;
various participants in the health information system; (c) a system that is technically robust and cost-&#13;
effective in terms of operating costs.&#13;
Remote Collection&#13;
9.    The purpose of remote collection is the automatic collection of the data generated by the health&#13;
information system(s) installed in district computers, in order to consolidate them at regional level and&#13;
then at national level. The computers in the districts and medical regions and in the Ministry are left&#13;
switched on from 8.00 PM to 8.00 AM (a period when reduced rates are charged for telephone use).&#13;
10.   Stage 1: Districts. Every evening from 8.00 PM, the "district-controlled program" (programme&#13;
de "pilotage District") installed in district computers checks whether there are any data files to be&#13;
transmitted to regional level. If there are in fact any such files, the control prograrn compresses them,&#13;
places them in an "envelope" file, calls the regional computer, and transmits the envelope to it. This&#13;
operation takes place (every evening, if necessary) between 8.00 PM and 9.00 PM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
11.    Stage 2: Regions. Every evening from 8.00 PM, the "region-controlled program" (programme&#13;
de "pilotage Region") installed in regional computers goes on standby to receive "envelope" files from&#13;
the districts. From 9.00 PM, the region-controlled program checks whether such files have been&#13;
received. If there are any, it decompresses them and automatically activates the information system(s) so&#13;
that the data from the districts will be processed and consolidated. This operation takes place (every&#13;
evening, if necessary) between 9.00 PM and 10.00 PM.&#13;
12.    From 10.00 PM, the region-controlled program checks whether there are any data files to be&#13;
transmitted to national level. If there are in fact any such files, the control program compresses them,&#13;
places them in an "envelope" file, calls the ministry computer, and transmits the envelope to it. This&#13;
operation takes place (every evening, if necessary) between 10.00 PM and 1 1.00 PM.&#13;
13.    Stage 3: The Ministry. At Ministry level, remote data collection is automatic. Before logging&#13;
out in the evening, the operator will perform the same procedure as is applied at regional and district&#13;
level, resetting the server ("PC Anywhere") by using the Alt+Ctrl+Del keys. The remote data collection&#13;
program will be launched automatically according to the schedules imposed by the "Ministry-controlled&#13;
program (programme "Pilote Ministere"). Every evening from 10.00 PM, the "Ministry-controlled&#13;
program" installed in the ministry computer goes on standby to receive "envelope" files from the&#13;
regions. From 11.00 PM, the Ministry-controlled program checks whether such files have been received.&#13;
If there are any, it decompresses them and automatically activates the information system(s) so that the&#13;
data from the regions will be processed and consolidated. This operation takes place (every night, if&#13;
necessary) between 11.00 PM and midnight. On the following morning, the administrator will find on&#13;
the LAN printer the results of the previous night's data collection, in the form of a synoptic table&#13;
(tableau de bord). The Ministry's administrator will begin the morning work session by rebooting the&#13;
PC Anywhere server, using the Alt+Ctrl+Del keys. This displays the access control screen. The&#13;
administrator then enters the appropriate user ID and password and can thus log on normally and use the&#13;
standard applications. After analyzing the synoptic table, the administrator can perform any necessary&#13;
reruns of connections to the regions or districts, so as to ensure that the health data can be properly&#13;
entered into the information system(s).&#13;
Remote Distribution&#13;
14.    The purpose of this is the automatic distribution of files (i.e. feedback resulting from the&#13;
consolidation of data from the health information system(s), versions of software, parameter tables,&#13;
messages, etc.) from national level to the regions, and then to the districts. The district, regional, and&#13;
ministry computers are left switched on overnight from 8.00 PM to 8.00 AM.&#13;
15.    Stage 1: The Ministry. At Ministry level, remote data distribution is automatic, and is launched&#13;
according to the schedules imposed by the Ministry-controlled program. Every night, beginning at&#13;
midnight, the Ministry-controlled program installed on the ministry computer checks whether there are&#13;
any data files to be transmitted to regional level. If there are in fact any such files, the control program&#13;
compresses them, places them in an "envelope" file, calls the regional computer, and transmits the&#13;
envelope to it. This operation takes place (every night, if necessary) between midnight and 1.00 AM.&#13;
The following morning, the administrator will find on the LAN printer the results of the previous night's&#13;
data distribution, in the form of a synoptic table (tableau de bord). After analyzing the synoptic table, the&#13;
administrator can perform any necessary reruns of connections to the regions and districts, so as to reach&#13;
a diagnosis with them regarding any incidents that may have affected distribution (e.g. the switching-off&#13;
of a computer, any incomplete transfers, etc.), and adopt the necessary corrective measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
16.    Stage 2: Regions. Every night, from midnight, the "region-controlled program" installed on&#13;
regional computers goes on standby to receive "envelope" files from the Ministry. From 1.00 AM, the&#13;
region-controlled program checks whether any such files have been received. If there are any, it&#13;
decompresses them and automatically activates the information system(s) so that it/they can perform the&#13;
feedback processing of the data from the Ministry. This operation takes place (every night, if necessary)&#13;
between 1.00 AM and 2.00 AM.&#13;
17.    From 2.00 AM, the region-controlled program checks whether there are any data files to be&#13;
transmitted to the districts. If there are in fact any such files, the control program compresses them,&#13;
places them in an "envelope" file, calls the district computers, and transmits the envelope to them. This&#13;
operation takes place (every night, if necessary) between 2.00 AM and 3.00 AM.&#13;
18.    Stage 3: Districts. Every night from 10.00 PM, the "district-controlled program" installed on&#13;
district computers goes on standby to receive "envelope" files from the regions. From 3.00 AM, the&#13;
district-controlled program checks whether such files have been received from the regions. If there are&#13;
any, it decompresses them and automatically activates the information system(s) so that it/they can&#13;
perform the feedback processing of the data from the regions. This operation takes place (every night, if&#13;
necessary) between 3.00 AM and 4.00 AM.&#13;
Remote Maintenance&#13;
19.    The purpose of remote maintenance is to enable the system administrator in the Ministry to&#13;
establish a remote link with any one of the regional or district computers in order to carry out&#13;
administrative operations (e.g. remote application of software, parameterization, diagnosis of software&#13;
problems, etc.), together with file transfers (whether Ministry-to-remote terminal or remote terminal-to-&#13;
Ministry).&#13;
20.    Principle. The administrator at the Ministry receives a telephone call from a district or region&#13;
requesting help with a software program. The administrator uses the Ministry-control program to&#13;
establish a connection with the district or regional computer. Once it is established, he can perform all&#13;
necessary administrative operations or file transfers, just as if he were on site. On screen is the same&#13;
display as at the remote terminal, and it responds directly to keystrokes and mouse-clicks. Remote&#13;
maintenance operations are also completely "transparent" from the viewpoint of the remote user.&#13;
Electronic Messaging&#13;
21.    The purpose is to enable the various operators in the health information system to exchange&#13;
messages, memos, and files with their colleagues, with or without delivery receipts.&#13;
22.    Principle. The Director of SNGE (the National Endemic Disease Service) wants a specific piece&#13;
of information (for example, the number of meningitis cases recorded over the past month in the various&#13;
health posts). He writes a message using the EM system's text processor, and can then use a single&#13;
command to send it to all districts, with copies to the regions. The following morning, as soon as the&#13;
district computers are logged on, the doctors can read the SNGE message that has arrived at the&#13;
electronic in-box. After collecting the data requested, the district doctors write messages using the EM&#13;
system's text processor and send them to SNGE. Electronic messaging will also enable the various&#13;
members of the health staff to communicate with their colleagues outside the system, because the&#13;
messaging server will be connected to external EM systems (through the Internet, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
Data Retrieval&#13;
23.    The purpose is to enable MSPAS's various agencies (i.e. the Office of the Minister, DAGE,&#13;
DAS, DHSP, etc.), and possibly other parties involved in the health sector, to consult the data in the&#13;
information system.&#13;
24.    Principle. The various directorates can connect to the MSPAS central network and use the&#13;
existing information system(s) solely in read-only mode.&#13;
Security&#13;
25.    Automatic encryption will be used to ensure the security of file transfers among districts,&#13;
regions, and the Ministry. The electronic messaging system will be name-linked and entirely&#13;
confidential. As regards the feedback and distribution of aggregated and consolidated data at regional&#13;
level, and subsequently at national level, the Ministry will define the level of confidentiality to apply to&#13;
indicators during the preparation of the specifications (cahier des charges) for the health application. All&#13;
PCs on the network (whether in districts or regions, or at the Ministry) will be equipped with an access&#13;
control system requiring the input of a user ID and password before access is granted to the various&#13;
applications (e.g. the health application, Word, Excel, electronic messaging, etc.).&#13;
26.    All PCs on the network will be equipped with a virus detection and elimination system. Use of&#13;
the diskette drive will be controlled by the access system, and PC users will not be able to install new&#13;
programs unless they have administrators' rights. All applications will be installed remotely, and&#13;
installation will be under the control of the administrators of the central network at MSPAS.&#13;
27.   In the case of power outages, PCs will be powered by a UPS. Prolonged outages, particularly at&#13;
night, will make it impossible for the remote data collection and distribution systems to operate. When&#13;
power is restored, the backlog of files in the districts and regions will be automatically collected and&#13;
distributed, in chronological order.&#13;
Organizational and Human Resource Aspects&#13;
28.   Installation of a network interconnecting all computers in the medical districts and regions and&#13;
the Ministry of Health will impose considerable changes on the procedures currently employed at sites&#13;
possessing computers.&#13;
At District Level&#13;
29.    Logging On. In the morning, operators will log on by rebooting their computer by means of the&#13;
Alt+Ctrl+Del keys, as a result of which the access control screen will be displayed. Operators will then&#13;
input their user IDs and passwords, after which they will be able to work in the normal way and use the&#13;
standard applications (the health information system, the WORD text-processing system, the EXCEL&#13;
spreadsheet, etc.). Before beginning their work, they will remove the backup cassettes from the&#13;
streamers and file them with the rest of the week's backups.&#13;
30.    Logging Off. In the evening, before logging off, operators will insert backup cassettes in their&#13;
streamers, and will then reset their computers by using the Alt+Ctrl+Del keys.&#13;

data input, and of the various stages in the confirmation of the processes of data collection and&#13;
distribution at national level.&#13;
Organization of Hardware Maintenance&#13;
35.    Hardware maintenance procedures are simplified, and the main objective of choosing to install&#13;
absolutely identical equipment throughout the territory is to facilitate hardware and software&#13;
maintenance. A standard configuration will be defined and installed at ministry level, then replicated&#13;
and tested on each of the computers intended for the regions and districts. Every day, an automatic&#13;
procedure will back up all data stored on the hard disks of all the regional and district computers. If a&#13;
software problem occurs, the administrator at the Ministry will establish a remote maintenance link in&#13;
order to diagnose and solve it. If a hardware problem arises, the regional or district operator will send to&#13;
the Ministry the whole of the configuration in question (i.e. the CPU, the monitor, the modem, and the&#13;
printer), together with the most recent backup cassette. The systems administrator at the Ministry will&#13;
recover all data from the cassette by using standby equipment, send all the data to the region or district,&#13;
and then make an initial diagnosis of the hardware problem, if necessary calling on the services of the&#13;
specialized company selected to maintain the whole of the Ministry's hardware.&#13;
Training&#13;
36.    Training will be provided for the following two groups:&#13;
(a)    district-level and regional operators, who will be assumed to have no background in&#13;
computers;&#13;
(b)    administrators at the Ministry; this function requires at least two persons, who will have&#13;
advanced training in computers and real experience of PCs.&#13;

Strengthening of the Statistics Division&#13;
37.   The project is under the authority of the Director of DHSP. In addition to the proposed computer&#13;
network (see above), it includes the rehabilitation of facilities, and the strengthening of human, physical,&#13;
and financial resources.&#13;
38.   Facilities. The establishment of a computer network bringing together the various existing&#13;
information systems calls for a strengthening of the Statistics Division. The latter is located in the DHSP&#13;
building, point E, which is not publicly owned and to which an eviction order has now been applied. The&#13;
Division is to be removed and relocated in the new DHSP headquarters (see Annex relating to the&#13;
institutional strengthening of SNGE).&#13;
39.   Human Resources. The staff of the Division should include the Chief, two computer engineers&#13;
to be responsible for network administration, and a person to be in charge of the health application and&#13;
the technical links between the Division and the Ministry's other units. The two engineers will play a&#13;
key role in establishing and monitoring the network. The risk is that, after a certain period, they may&#13;
leave these positions and go into the private sector. One possible solution would be to enter into a&#13;
contract under which a local private company would second two of its staff to the Division.&#13;
40.   Physical Resources. The necessary physical resources for the network have been identified in&#13;
the proposal for the technical network. However, attention should be given to the preparation of the&#13;
information-carrying medium to be used between the health posts and the districts where the data are&#13;
input into the system. These paper record forms should be designed to match the spreadsheets in the&#13;
system, thus facilitating data input. Over the coming months, consideration will be given to this issue,&#13;
and a draft form will be designed. It will be finalized once the planning of the information system is&#13;
complete.&#13;
41.   Training. Training in the use of the network is provided for in the contract to be signed with the&#13;
company installing the network. Training in the use of the health application will be provided by the&#13;
company developping the health software.&#13;
42.   Training in indicators for the health application is provided for under the project, except for&#13;
regional level, responsibility for which lies with the various donors (UNICEF, USAID, the World Bank,&#13;
etc.). The training could be modular, with an initial six-day module for the transfer of know-how,&#13;
followed -- after a period of work in the field -- by a second module, lasting four days, so that the&#13;
knowledge gained could be confirmed and consolidated.&#13;

43.   Training Modules. The users of the information system will be taught the indicators for each of&#13;
its components by means of training modules, which the relevant ministry units, assisted by the partners,&#13;
would be responsible for preparing.&#13;
44.   Technical Assistance. USAID has offered MSPAS two years of technical assistance, which the&#13;
Ministry has accepted in principle.&#13;

Stages in the Health Application&#13;
45.   Preparation of Specifications (Cahier des Charges; Month 1). An information system design&#13;
method will have to be used in preparing the application specifications. Merise is a well-tried design&#13;
method that could be applied to preparing metamodels for the future health information system. Merise&#13;
uses two complementary axes for structuring information systems: data, and the processes applied to&#13;
them.&#13;
46.   The specifications will define the services and supplies to be provided, in line with the needs&#13;
identified. The document will be contractually binding and indicate general, operating, and technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
speciflcations: (i) main objectives; (ii) constraints resulting from the physical environment; (iii)&#13;
identification of data and procedures.&#13;
The specifications will identify particular features of the Health Software (Logiciel Sante)&#13;
e-eating to the security of data exchanges among sites. They will also indicate links with the cartographic&#13;
application. This document, which will be binding upon the selected suppliers of these services, will&#13;
also define how the application is to be delivered. In order to check that the application is user-friendly&#13;
and that the MSPAS requirements have been met, arrangements should be made so that the&#13;
concatenation of the various steps in data processing can be checked in successive stages.&#13;
48.    Supervision (months 2 through 12). Supervision of the design, implementation, and&#13;
installation of the health application will be ongoing. It will consist of the permanent monitoring of the&#13;
area in question. The relevant supervisory reference points will be defined before each of the various&#13;
sta,s, is launched, the purpose being to enable progress in the project to be evaluated, and adjustments&#13;
made  for any slippage. The project architect will be in charge of supervision, and will be responsible for&#13;
coordination and consistency between the application and network components.&#13;
-4R-, . Development (months 2 through 6). Development consists of the following elements: (i)&#13;
deualied specifications; (ii) prototyping; (iii) programming of the application in accordance with the&#13;
contractual specifications; (iv) individual tests; (v) integration tests; (vi) delivery to users.&#13;

ovb provided, for the following persons: (i) those using the application in the Statistics Division; (ii)&#13;
ninIistry users; (iii) users in the districts and regions.&#13;
Tl.ransfer of responsibility (month 10). MSPAS is the owner of the source programs for the&#13;
1ueafth application. The transfer of responsibility involves training the computer engineers attached to&#13;
.'ISPAS so that they can take over all maintenance operations and the development of the application.&#13;

or c-ation of the computer network in the regions and districts (PCs, modems, streamers, servers,&#13;
r'nters, and UPSs), together with the installation of the facilities and the computers (wiring) at MSPAS,&#13;
D1akar.&#13;
.33.    Software (month 5). This consists of the procurement of software, including antivirus,&#13;
comamunications, access control, monitoring, restarting, driver, and compression programs.&#13;
Jil.    Training (months 6 through 11). This is provided when the hardware is installed in the regions&#13;
and districts. It focuses on computer use and network interfacing during maintenance.&#13;
Deployment (months 6 through 11). This consists of the installation of all work stations and&#13;
se.vers in the various agencies, both at the pilot site and during the phase of general installation.&#13;
56.    Supplies (month 9). Supplies include the consumables necessary for operating the network for&#13;

REPUBLIQUE DU SENEGAL&#13;
PROJET DE LUTTE CONTRE LES MALADIES ENDEMIQUES&#13;
LE SERVICE NATIONAL DES GRANDES ENDEMIES&#13;
I.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Le Service National des Grandes Endemies, qui depend de la Direction de l'Hygiene et&#13;
de la Sante Publique (DHSP) au Ministere de la Sante Publique et des Affaires Sociales&#13;
(MSPAS), s'est progressivement affaibli durant les vingt dernieres annees. A ce jour, le Service&#13;
n'est pas en mesure de faire face aux defis que posent, au Ministere de la Sante, la resurgence&#13;
des maladies endemiques telles que le paludisme ou les bilharzioses, le retour de grandes&#13;
epidemies telles que le cholera ou la meningite, et l'apparition des nouvelles epidemies virales.&#13;
2.     Au niveau central, le concept et l'esprit d'equipe du "Service National des Grandes&#13;
Endemies" ont disparu. Les locaux et le personnel sont disperses; les ressources materielles et&#13;
financieres proviennent principalement des bailleurs de fonds qui les allouent a des programmes&#13;
specifiques. Le Ministere de la Sante, en consequence, a peu de contr6le sur la planification et la&#13;
conduite des activites de surveillance et de contr6le des maladies endemiques et des maladies a&#13;
risque epidemique eleve. Au niveau peripherique, certains "Secteurs des Grandes Endemies" ont&#13;
disparu, d'autres secteurs sont extremement reduits en personnel et en moyens; quelques uns ont&#13;
une plethore de personnel inactif et demotive.&#13;
3.     Afin de repondre aux defis que posent la persistance des anciens fleaux et l'apparition de&#13;
nouvelles epidemies, le MSPAS engage une reforme du Service National des Grandes Endemies&#13;
dans le contexte du processus de decentralisation des services de sante. La Republique du&#13;
Senegal a demande l'appui financier de ses partenaires dans le developpement pour mener a bien&#13;
cette reforme. Ce document decrit dans un premier temps la situation du Service National des&#13;
Grandes End6mies, et dans un deuxieme temps un projet de renforcement des capacites de ce&#13;
Service.&#13;
II.    SITUATION ACTUELLE&#13;
Mission&#13;
4.     A cejour, le Service National des Grandes Endemies est un service de medecine&#13;
collective, curative et preventive, specialise dans la lutte contre les endemies majeures. Les&#13;
endemies se presentent sous trois aspects: (i) les maladies endemiques a transmission&#13;
relativement lente, presentes en permanence avec un taux de morbidit6 sensiblement constant,&#13;
telles que le paludisme, les bilharzioses, la dracunculose, la lpre, la tuberculose, la&#13;
trypanosomiase humaine africaine, I'onchocercose ; (ii) les maladies epidemiques a transmission&#13;
rapide et extensive, telles que le cholera, la meningite cer6bro-spinale, la fievre jaune et les&#13;
maladies ciblees par le PEV ; et (iii) les maladies entrainant une cecit6. L'objectif vise est&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

9.     Le Service de la Lutte Antiparasitaire (SLAP) a 6te cr6e en 1952 A 1'epoque du&#13;
Programme d'Eradication du paludisme et s'appelait alors "Service de Lutte Antipaludique". II&#13;
est base A Thies dans les vastes locaux d'une ancienne caseme. Lors de ]'abandon du&#13;
programme d'eradication, le service a change de nom pour prendre celui d'aujourd'hui. Ses&#13;
activites sont essentiellement : (i) la recherche entomologique dans le cadre de la lutte contre le&#13;
paludisme en association avec l'ORSTOM et l'Universite ; (ii) des activites curatives a l'image&#13;
de ceux d'un CS sans activites chirurgicales ; et (iii) des activites de laboratoire medicale&#13;
centrees sur la recherche parasitaire.&#13;

Tab. 2: Ressources Humaines dans les Secteurs des Grandes Endemies,&#13;
(Mars 1996).&#13;
Les Activites du Service National des Grandes Endemies&#13;
Niveau Central&#13;
17.    Le niveau central du Service National des Grandes Endemies mene des activites de&#13;
supervision de quelques programmes de lutte dont la majorite des activit6s sont menees par les&#13;
personnels des services de soins de sante primaire.&#13;
Les Secteurs&#13;
18.    Concemant la lutte contre les endemies, seules les activites des programmes de lutte&#13;
contre la lepre, de lutte contre l'onchocercose et du PEV sont menees regulierement par les&#13;
personnels des Secteurs. Les Secteurs ont souvent de fait des activites de consultation generale&#13;
et de laboratoire d'un CS, sans les activites de chirurgie.&#13;
Le Service de Lutte Anti-Parasitaire (SLAP)&#13;
19.    Le SLAP mene plusieurs activites mais peu en liaison avec les bureaux du Service&#13;
National des Grandes Endemies. II mene d'une part des activites de recherche avec l'Universite&#13;
et l'ORSTOM et d'autre part des activites de consultation generales et des consultations de&#13;
laboratoire.&#13;
III.    PROBLEMES&#13;
20.    Le Service National des Grandes Endemies n'a pas ete inclu dans les reflexions&#13;
accompagnant le processus de decentralisation des services de sante. Sa mission et son&#13;
organisation n'ont pas ete redefinies dans le cadre de la nouvelle Politique de Sante. Le Service,&#13;
tel qu'il existe actuellement, est un vestige d'une Politique de Sante ancienne qui remonte a la&#13;
periode coloniale. Cette absence d'evolution a conduit le SNGE a une diminution de ses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
95&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 6 of 11&#13;
ressources humaines, materielles et financieres et A une perte de son identite.&#13;
Institutionnellement faible, le SNGE a ete de fait destructure par les differents programmes de&#13;
lutte "verticaux" contr6les financierement par les bailleurs de fonds; il a aussi perdu ses&#13;
capacites d'analyse et de reponse globale aux maladies infectieuses qui restent les premieres&#13;
causes de mortalite au Sen6gal.&#13;
21.    Cette destructuration se traduit par la perte de l'esprit et du travail d'equipe, aussi bien&#13;
au niveau central qu'au niveau peripherique. Ce manque d'esprit d'equipe est aggrave au niveau&#13;
central par l'eparpillement du personnel. Aussi bien au niveau central qu'au niveau des&#13;
Secteurs, aucun agent, etant donnee la gestion tres "verticale" des Programmes, n'est informe, ou&#13;
n'a des activites dans un Programme different de celui dans lequel il a ete assigne. Par exemple&#13;
au niveau des Secteurs, la diminution des activites dans les programmes de contr6le de la lepre et&#13;
de l'onchocercose font qu'un grand nombre du personnel est sous-employe, sans que l'on puisse&#13;
les affecter A d'autres activites.&#13;
22.    Au niveau des Secteurs, l'utilisation des ressources humaines, materielles et financieres&#13;
ne peut que tres difficilement proceder d'une approche globale dans la programmation des&#13;
activites des personnels de sante regionaux. La premiere raison est la repercussion de la&#13;
situation de destructuration observee au niveau central. Une autre raison est l'eloignement des&#13;
Secteurs par rapport aux RM.&#13;
23.    Le SNGE a peu d'activites de surveillance epidemiologique au sens propre du terme.&#13;
Toutes les maladies endemiques et les maladies epidemiques ne font pas l'objet d'un programme&#13;
de surveillance et de contr6le. En general, les programmes existants ont des objectifs non&#13;
chiffres; les strategies ne s'accompagnent ni d'une evaluation des ressources disponibles, ni de&#13;
leur faisabilite et de leur acceptabilite. En ce qui conceme la definition d'indicateurs&#13;
epidemiologiques pertinents pour guider les activites des programmes et pour evaluer leurs&#13;
progres, seuls quelques indicateurs de morbidite et de mortalite sont disponibles. Enfin, la&#13;
collecte des donnees et leur transmission, le calcul des indicateurs et leur transmission aux&#13;
responsables peuvent prendre des mois, voire plus d'une annee, rendant leur utilisation&#13;
pratiquement inutile dans la gestion des programmes et dans la prise rapide de decision.&#13;
24.   II n'existe pas de systeme d'alerte en cas d'epidemie. Les recentes epidemies de cholera,&#13;
de meningite et les menaces d'eclosion de la fievre jaune rendent indispensable la mise en place&#13;
d'un systeme d'alerte precoce.&#13;
25.    Le SLAP n'est pas, a travers ses activites, integre dans les differents programmes de&#13;
lutte des maladies endemiques, et son maintien dans la nouvelle politique de sante devrait etre&#13;
remis en question. Le laboratoire de parasitologie fait double emploi avec celui de l'h6pital&#13;
regional de Thies. Les activites entomologiques etant peu nombreuses et liees principalement A&#13;
la recherche, il serait plus rationnel de devoluer, sous forme de contrat, les activites du&#13;
laboratoire d'entomologie A la faculte des sciences.&#13;
26.    Le SNGE, par l'intermediaire des Secteurs, mene des activites de consultations curatives&#13;
et de laboratoires qui "doublent" soit celles des CS, soit celles des h6pitaux regionaux selon la&#13;
localisation des Secteurs. En resulte une utilisation peu rationnelle des ressources humaines,&#13;
materielles et financieres du SNGE. Ces activites curatives detournent les personnels des&#13;
Secteurs de leurs activites premieres qui sont la surveillance epidemiologique et le contr6le des&#13;
maladies endemiques, dans un contexte de sante publique.&#13;
&#13;

27.    Les locaux ou sont loges la DHSP et en particulier le SNGE n'appartiennent pas au&#13;
patrimoine national. De plus, la DHSP fait l'objet d'une mesure d'expulsion par les&#13;
proprietaires.&#13;
IV.   PROJET DE RENFORCEMENT INSTITUTIONNEL&#13;
Objectifs&#13;
28.    Le MSPAS souhaite renforcer les capacites du SNGE dans l'organisation de la lutte&#13;
contre les maladies endemiques et les maladies a risque epidemique eleve qui posent au Senegal&#13;
un probleme de sant6 publique. Le MSPAS a emis le souhait: (i) que ce renforcement se fasse&#13;
dans le cadre de la decentralisation des services de sante et que les activites du SNGE soient&#13;
complementaires de celles des autres services de sante ; (ii) que les nouvelles structures&#13;
organisationnelles et administratives du SNGE refletent le souci de rationalisation et de cout-&#13;
efficacite dans l'utilisation des ressources humaines, logistiques, materielles et financieres ; et&#13;
(iii) que ses partenaires au developpement appuient cette reforme, en particulier en delaissant A&#13;
terme l'approche "verticale" dans la lutte contre les maladies endemiques et epidemiques.&#13;
29.    Les objectifs specifiques de la reforme sont les suivants: (i) redefinir la mission du&#13;
SNGE dans le contexte de la decentralisation des services de sante ; (ii) etablir l'organigramme&#13;
et l'organisation du travail au sein du SNGE, au niveau central et au niveau des regions ; (iii)&#13;
6tablir au niveau central un groupe d'experts avec un fort esprit et un travail d'equipe ; et (iv)&#13;
dvaluer et allouer les ressources necessaires au SNGE pour executer sa mission.&#13;
Mission du SNGE&#13;
30.    Le SNGE concoit, coordonne et suit la politique du MSPAS dans le domaine de la lutte&#13;
contre les maladies endemiques et les maladies A risque epidemique elevd. II concoit des&#13;
programmes de lutte contre les maladies d'importance pour la sante publique et propose&#13;
plusieurs strategies en incluant des considerations de faisabilite politique, materielle et&#13;
economique. Le choix de la strategie appartient au MSPAS et au Gouvemement. Une fois la&#13;
strategie choisie, le SNGE a la responsabilite de son operationalisation et, si necessaire, de la&#13;
coordination des differents ministeres et/ou partenaires au developpement du MSPAS qui sont&#13;
impliques dans l'execution et/ou dans le financement des activites.&#13;
31.    Dans ce cadre, le SNGE etablit les plans operationnels de surveillance epidemiologique&#13;
et de lutte, dont l'execution est faite par les personnels de sante des districts et des regions. Les&#13;
antennes regionales du SNGE participent A l'elaboration de ces plans operationnels en ajustant&#13;
ceux-ci aux realites locales.&#13;
Abandon des Activites de Consultation&#13;
32.    Dans un souci de rationalisation des ressources humaines, materielles, logistiques et&#13;
financieres, le SNGE devrait transferer ses activites curatives (consultations generales et&#13;
consultations ophtalmologiques) et ses activites de laboratoire au service des Soins de Sante&#13;
Primaire et A la Direction des hopitaux. Le laboratoire national de lutte contre la&#13;

Page 8 of 11&#13;
tuberculosedevrait voir son statut revise dans les mois qui viennent dans le cadre de la&#13;
reoganisation des services du MSPAS.&#13;
Le SLAP&#13;
33.    Le SLAP verra dans les prochaines semaines sa mission precisee. De maniere generale,&#13;
le SLAP devrait par ses activites fournir au SNGE les informations relatives au suivi des&#13;
vecteurs des maladies endemiques et des maladies epidemiques. Le SLAP devrait travailler en&#13;
etroite collaboration avec l'Universite et les centres techniques comme l'ORSTOM, etc... La&#13;
localisation, le personnel et les moyens necessaires au SLAP devraient etre evalues des la&#13;
definition exacte de sa mission.&#13;
Organisation&#13;
34.    Le concept de "Coordinateur National" disparait. C'est l'equipe du SNGE toute entiere&#13;
qui est responsable de l'organisation des programmes de lutte pour chaque maladie. Le chef de&#13;
service du SNGE est responsable de la gestion du personnel et de l'attribution des taches.&#13;
L'equipe centrale etant restreinte, il est indispensable de travailler en equipe et d'avoir la plus&#13;
grande flexibilite. Les ressources humaines, logistiques et financieres ne sont pas allouees A un&#13;
programme de lutte particulier mais sont A la disposition du SNGE pour l'execution de sa&#13;
mission. Le chef de service du SNGE est responsable de la gestion rationnelle des ressources&#13;
disponibles.&#13;
35.    Au niveau regional, les personnels des Secteurs des Grandes Endemies font partie A part&#13;
entiere de l'equipe de la region medicale. Le "medecin-chef du Secteur" est l'adjoint du&#13;
m6decin-chef de region. Dans la repartition des taches entre les deux medecins, les activites&#13;
relatives A la lutte contrer les maladies endemiques et les maladies epidemiques sont la&#13;
responsabilite du medecin-chef adjoint. Cette distinction, de meme que l'appartenance au&#13;
"Secteur" n'est pas basee sur une organisation administrative specifique mais plut6t sur une&#13;
reconnaissance de competences particulieres. II en est de meme pour les infirmiers et autres&#13;
agents sanitaires. Aucun infirmier ou agent sanitaire n'est rattache A un programme particulier.&#13;
L'attribution des responsabilites, et I'appartenance au "Secteur" dans la conduite des activites&#13;
relevent seulement de la competence et non d'une nomination administrative.&#13;
36.    La gestion des ressources attribuees aux activites de lutte contre les maladies&#13;
endemiques et epidemiques se fait dans le cadre de la gestion des ressources de la region&#13;
medicale et dans le contexte de l'execution du Plan Regional de Developpement Sanitaire et&#13;
Social. Comme au niveau de l'equipe centrale, il sera necessaire, etant donne le nombre de&#13;
maladies d'impotance pour la sante publique et le peu de personnel, de mettre l'accent sur la&#13;
flexibilite du personnel.&#13;
Periode de Transition&#13;
37.    Le passage de l'organisation actuelle, dite "verticale" a une organisation "integree"&#13;
demandera du temps et des efforts d'explication. Un programme important de formation devrait&#13;
permettre une plus grande flexibilite du personnel. De nombreuses visites et supervisions des&#13;
responsables du SNGE devrait avoir lieu pendant les deux premieres annees du projet. Les&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 7&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
avantages particuliers dont beneficient les agents attaches a des programmes specifiques devront&#13;
progressivement disparaitre apres concertation et explication.&#13;
Obstacle Principal&#13;
38.    La principale contrainte a la mise en place de cette reforme de l'organisation du travail&#13;
est sans aucun doute la perte d'avantages financiers et materiels pour les personnels jusque Ia&#13;
rattaches a des programmes de lutte disposant de moyens financiers importants. Cet obstacle&#13;
devrait etre surmonte par une meilleure equite dans la repartition des benefices qu'apporteraient&#13;
temporairement certains programmes de lutte. Cette reponsabilite sera celle du medecin-chef&#13;
adjoint et chef de 1'equipe du Secteur des Grandes Endemies.&#13;
Developpement d'un Esprit d'Equipe&#13;
39.    Le succes de la r6forme et du renforcement du SNGE depend en grande partie du&#13;
developpement de l'esprit d'equipe au sein du SNGE et des Secteurs. La nouvelle&#13;
organisationdu travail devrait faciliter le developpement de cet esprit. Neanmoins, il sera&#13;
necessaire de faciliter ce developpement par des exercices conduits par des professionnels. Le&#13;
projet prevoit un appui financier particulier pour developper 1'esprit d'equipe. Enfin, le FAC&#13;
finance une assistance technique longue dont les termes de ref6rence comportent une expertise&#13;
dans le developpement du travail en equipe.&#13;
Ressources Humaines, Materielles et Financieres&#13;
Ressources Humaines&#13;
40.    Le personnel du niveau central du SNGE comprend: le Chef de Service, 4 medecins&#13;
epidemiologistes (les medecins superviseurs actuels), le medecin epidemiologiste entomologiste&#13;
actuel chef du SLAP, 2 techniciens superieurs et une secretaire. Au niveau des Secteurs, le&#13;
personnel-type d'un Secteur comprend: un medecin epidemiologiste responsable du Secteur qui&#13;
seconde le Medecin-Chef de Region (MCR), un administrateur-gestionnaire qui sera le meme&#13;
que celui de la RM, 3 ou 4 IDE/AS/TM dont un forme a la saisie informatique des donnees, un&#13;
ou deux chauffeurs.&#13;
Ressources Mate'rielles et Logistiques&#13;
41.   Un ordinateur est fourni au Secteur dans le cadre du systeme d'information. Deux&#13;
vehicules sont necessaires a chaque Secteur; un decompte des vehicules en etat a ete fait et sera&#13;
pris en compte lors de l'evaluation des besoins. En fonction des situations epidemiologiques&#13;
propres a chaque region, il est possible de varier le nombre et la qualite des personnels des&#13;
Secteurs si necessaire (e.g. malacologiste dans la region de St Louis)&#13;
Ressources Financieres&#13;
42.    Les ressources financieres sont variables en fonction des activites specifiques de la&#13;
region et doivent etre evaluees dans le contexte du Plan Regional de Developpement Sanitaire et&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Social. Actuellement, chaque Secteur dispose d'environ US$ 10,000 par an pour son&#13;
fonctionnement, 1'eau, 1'electricite et le carburant.&#13;
Rehabilitation des Locaux&#13;
43.   Un batiment du patrimoine national, d'une surface habitable d'environ 6,000 m2, est&#13;
attribue au MSPAS, en particulier A la DHSP, et sera rehabifite dans le cadre du projet.&#13;
L'ensemble des personnels du SNGE (superviseurs nationaux + le chef du SLAP) est regroupe&#13;
au niveau du nouveau batiment de la DHSP. Au niveau de chaque RM, un batiment sera&#13;
rehabilite pour heberger les personnels des Secteurs des Grandes Endemies afin de faciliter la&#13;
coordination des activites et des personnels des RM et des Secteurs.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL&#13;
ENDEMIC DISEASE CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
I.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    This project is designed to strengthen national capabilities in the surveillance and control&#13;
of endemic and potential epidemic diseases, and to afford an opportunity to upgrade the public&#13;
sector agency vested with these responsibilities. The project is part of the health sector&#13;
investment program (SIP) the Government is presently preparing with World Bank and donor&#13;
assistance. The SIP will consist of a five year-investment program for the period 1997-2000.&#13;
The SIP was initiated following the adoption by the Government of a strategic framework of&#13;
health sector development. This report examines the following aspects of the project: (i)&#13;
economic and sectoral context; (ii) economic impact and cost-effectiveness; (iii) budgetary&#13;
impact of recurrent costs; (iv) analysis of institutional capacity; and (v) poverty alleviation&#13;
effects.&#13;
11.    ECONOMIC AND SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
2.    The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Senegal, discussed by the Board on February&#13;
16, 1995, supports the Government's 1995-97 economic recovery program-a program intended&#13;
to eliminate structural imbalances stemming from the country's poor economic management&#13;
record over the last ten years, and to lay the foundations for sustainable economic growth. One&#13;
of the program's major strategic axis is that of human resources development. In the case of the&#13;
health sector, this means improving the availability of basic health services in both urban and&#13;
rural areas, thereby helping to raise the productivity of the working population. With this goal in&#13;
mind, the Government's strategy is to reverse the trend toward lower expenditure of maintaining&#13;
health services, by increasing budget appropriations and simultaneously improving resource&#13;
allocation within the sector.&#13;
3.     Since 1993, the Government has conducted several studies designed to give it a better&#13;
grasp of the obstacles to, and opportunities for, health sector development existing in the&#13;
Senegalese economy. A health sector public expenditure review was also carried out in 1993. A&#13;
study on sector financing is currently under way. Also in progress is a study on the promotion of&#13;
a shared system to ensure better health care delivery, and a separate study on ways of&#13;
diversifying hospital revenue sources. These studies will complement reforms aimed at giving&#13;
hospitals greater management autonomy.&#13;
4.    In addition, the Government has mapped out programs for the control of malaria,&#13;
onchocerciasis and schistosomiasis. The proposed project is a natural extension of these, and of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 5&#13;
policy changes associated therein. It also fits in with the Government's sectoral investment&#13;
strategy, as well as with the health policy the Bank envisages supporting in Senegal.&#13;
III.   ECONOMIC IMPACT, COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS AND ALTERNATIVES&#13;
5.     The general objective of the project is to strengthen the country's ability to control&#13;
endemic, and potentially epidemic diseases. Its specific objectives are: institutional&#13;
reinforcement of the National Endemic Diseases Agency (Service national des grandes&#13;
endemies), development of a computerized, network-based health information (and&#13;
epidemiological surveillance) system, and targeted assistance with implementation of malaria,&#13;
onchocerciasis and schistosomiasis control programs. The project is consistent with both the&#13;
Bank's assistance strategy for Senegal, and the Government's economic recovery strategy. It&#13;
will contribute to greater effectiveness in the health sector and reduce the burden infectious&#13;
diseases place on the economy.&#13;
6.    The malaria control program, the main component of the project, is expected to have a&#13;
significant economic impact. All health statistics in Senegal point to malaria as the leading&#13;
cause of disease and death nationwide. For instance, the malaria program itself puts the&#13;
morbidity rate of 1993 at 35.3%. At present, however, Senegal has no data to provide a basis for&#13;
quantifying its economic losses attributable to malaria and evaluating the extent to which they&#13;
impede its development. Some preliminary studies on this subject have recently been conducted&#13;
in other countries in the subregion, namely Cameroon, Chad, Congo and Burkina Faso. Malaria&#13;
research throughout the African continent as a whole reveals that while the effective economic&#13;
cost of malaria at both the individual and household levels is still largely unknown, significant&#13;
costs are incurred with respect to time lost, transport to obtain health care, early death, and health&#13;
care services. Although some of these factors are measurable, the extent of under-employment&#13;
and the seasonal nature of work in rural areas make it difficult to determine the actual impact of&#13;
this disease on productivity and development.&#13;
7.    The malaria studies conducted in Cameroon, Chad, Congo, and in particular Burkina&#13;
Faso, assess the direct costs of treating the disease and carrying out control activities, and the&#13;
indirect costs associated with work time lost and early death. These results have allowed the&#13;
economic impact of malaria to be measured and extrapolations to be made as a basis for&#13;
estimates covering sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. The average daily cost of producing goods&#13;
and services is estimated at US$0.82. The average case of malaria results in the loss of 11 work&#13;
days, or a cost per individual of US$9.84, or around 2% of per capita GNP in Senegal. Given the&#13;
country's still high population growth rate of 2.,7 and the low per capita income, currently&#13;
equivalent to about US$600 annually, the product lost for illness will be important. The malaria&#13;
control measures proposed will help mitigate this loss, or possibly reverse it owing to their&#13;
positive effect on total working time.&#13;
8.    The findings of cost-effectiveness studies in the fields of basic health care promotion and&#13;
infectious diseases control in developing countries justify intervention by the public sector.&#13;
Government financing of a range of essential health services is warranted by the large positive&#13;
externality it generates, and the fact that it reduces poverty and promotes equity. In Senegal, the&#13;
health insurance system remains limited, with many individuals being responsible for their own&#13;

health costs. A private medical consultation for a common ailment costs approximately US$18,&#13;
which uninsured persons pay directly from their pockets; the direct cost of the same consultation&#13;
to a poor patient attending a public health facility, in particular in rural area, is around US$2.50.&#13;
9.    By putting particular emphasis on prevention as a means of disease control, the proposed&#13;
project will provide a notable opportunity to reduce indirect costs, especially for health care&#13;
sought during the rainy season, when access to clinics is very difficult and takes longer, thereby&#13;
pushing costs higher-or even impossible, as in the case of mothers and children who die before&#13;
treatment can be obtained. The prevention strategy will be to educate mothers (the recognized&#13;
main providers of basic health care) on how to treat diseases effectively, with more accessible&#13;
means, from the earliest possible instance. In addition, medication will be distributed through&#13;
health committees at village-level rather than through the few private pharmacies in rural areas, a&#13;
method that reduces their cost substantially.&#13;
IV.   BUDGETARY IMPACT OF RECURRENT COSTS&#13;
10.   During the course of the pre-appraisal mission, recurrent costs stemming from&#13;
investment operations associated with each project component were identified so that their&#13;
impact on the budget of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Action could be estimated. An&#13;
examination was also made of the permanent arrangements for financing.&#13;
11.   An analysis of the Health Ministry's operating budget before and during project&#13;
implementation is presented below. The effect of recurrent costs in the post-project period is&#13;
also presented, an analysis which will form an integral part of the appraisal of recurrent expenses&#13;
likely to be generated by the actions and measures planned under the health sector investment&#13;
program for the next five years.&#13;

a)    Composition&#13;
12.   Examination of the MSPAS's budget structure indicates an improvement in&#13;
expenditures' composition. Payroll costs absorbed approximately 68% of the total appropriation&#13;
to the agency in 1993, a figure which subsequently began to decline, reaching 53% in 1996,&#13;
while expenditures for supplies increased to 45% in 1996. This pattern reflects a concern to&#13;
adjust health spending to emphasize maintenance operations and reduce payroll costs to levels&#13;
commensurate with budget resources.&#13;
b)    Trends&#13;
13.   Over the last three years, following the devaluation of the CFAF, the MSPAS budget has&#13;
shown an average (15%) growth in current value. The share of the Ministry's operating cost&#13;
figures over the same period have been 5.8%, 6.48% and 6.75% of the Government's total&#13;
budget. This stabilization of the MSPAS general budget is not in accordance with the stated&#13;
intention of raising it to 9% by the year 2000 in order to ensure coverage of basic health care&#13;
needs. However, this short coming in budget is mitigated: the formulas worked out for&#13;
community participation in health costs have partially covered financing gaps thus far. This&#13;
move towards participation will continue, being reinforced on the basis of mutual/health&#13;
insurance system formulas now being developed within communities served by existing health&#13;
facilities, with donor assistance from France, the European Union, and IDA (as part of its next&#13;
health sector project).&#13;
14.   The above table on the national budget projections for the next five years, which&#13;
assumes an average annual growth of 3% (the Finance Ministry's low hypothesis), shows the&#13;
health sector share gradually reaching the level of 9% by the year 2000. That will help as a tool&#13;
to increase the sector's effectiveness in delivering primary health care, as well as reducing the&#13;
high morbidity rate in the country due to endemic diseases.&#13;

15.   Project-related recurrent costs will total CFAF 1.172 million over the project's&#13;
implementation period, or an average of CFAF235 million per annum. Their financing, described&#13;
below, depends on whether they are the operating costs of project's implementation, or the&#13;
supplementary expenses of a permanent nature associated with post-project program&#13;
continuation and development.&#13;
16.   During project execution, the Government will make counterpart contributions of 10%&#13;
of operating expenses and the cost of goods and services-for a total of CFAF200 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
105&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
However, once the execution phase is completed, for the continuance of various activities, the&#13;
Government will allocate CFAF828.5 million for program supervision costs (operating expenses,&#13;
vehicle maintenance, equipment and materials, and computer network maintenance arrangements&#13;
with a private contractor). The purchasing of medications will be the responsibility of&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
17.   The CFAFI,172 million additional expenditure during project implementation will&#13;
correspond to 13,8% of investment spending, of which the Government will support CFAF200&#13;
million, representing 0.6% of the MSPAS budget under the above budget projections up to the&#13;
year 2000.&#13;
V.    INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
18.   As previously noted, one of the objectives of the proposed project is to strengthen&#13;
national capabilities in the surveillance and control of endemic and potentially epidemic&#13;
diseases. The project will help in reorganizing and upgrading a nationwide health management&#13;
information system. For the most part, elements of the existing system are designed to respond&#13;
to specific programs financed by donors with differing objectives. Consequently, redundant&#13;
information is being generated by the same health agencies, but none have as yet been able to&#13;
develop an instrument to assist in decision-making analyses. The new system will be set up to&#13;
fill this gap during project execution.&#13;
19.   Supervision of this disease control project will be the responsibility of MSPAS, through&#13;
the staff of its Directorate of Hygiene and Public Health, to which SNGE is answerable.&#13;
VI.   POVERTY ALLEVIATION ANALYSIS&#13;
20.   The economic recession faced by Senegal in recent years has profoundly affected the&#13;
health sector, as budget restrictions have led to the deterioration of health infrastructure,&#13;
disruptions in supplies of essential pharmaceutical products, and in some places, to shortages of&#13;
appropriately qualified medical personnel. The difficulties have been exacerbated by the poor&#13;
use of limited sector financial resources. For the most part, it is the poor who have borne the&#13;
brunt of the situation, with their contributions to the financing of health care services. Moreover,&#13;
maintenance and expansion of health coverage in Senegal has been largely ascribable to donor&#13;
activities. IDA, through its just-completed Health and Population Project, has strengthened the&#13;
ability of district-level health structures to provide a basic range of health care delivery services,&#13;
and has assisted in developing the national essential drugs supply and distribution system.&#13;
21.   Poverty studies carried out in Senegal in 1993, revealed that 80% of poor households are&#13;
found in rural areas, and that the poor allocate 17% of their monthly spending to health. The&#13;
rural poor are the group with the least access to health services, and the diseases targeted by the&#13;
proposed project are most prevalent in rural areas. The Government is currently working&#13;
towards the improved targeting of poor population groups, and successful completion of the&#13;
proposed project's activities will advance this aim.&#13;

            Senegal - Endemic Disease Control Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The global objective of the Endemic
            Disease Control Project is to help the government alleviate
            the burden of endemic and epidemic diseases among the
            Senegalese populations, with a reduction of malaria,
            schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis. For the year 2002, the
            following benchmarks are established: (1) reduce by 25
            percent infant mortality attributable to malaria; (2) reduce
            by 90 percent school-age children morbidity attributable to
            urinary schistosomiasis; and (3) eliminate the risk of
            blindness due to onchocerciasis. To achieve these
            objectives, the project will support policy measures
            designed to: (1) improve management and implementation of
            disease control activities; (2) develop an integrated and
            computerized health management information system (SIG) and
            its use; and (3) strengthen the National Endemic Disease
            Service's (SNGE) capabilities and the Hygiene and
            Public Health Directorate's (DHSP) ability in project
            management. Specifically, project support will take the form
            of financing consultant services to design and produce
            information campaigns and national control programs, and
            studies and operational research; the education of
            opinionmakers and householders; using preventative measures
            and dispensing pharmaceuticals to treat schoolchildren;
            training nurses and the national endemic disease service
            staff; the procurement of computer hardware and software,
            furniture and other equipment; and the design and
            supervision of civil works.
