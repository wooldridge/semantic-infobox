determined&#13;
Project Objectives  The Government of Guinea adopted the National Program for&#13;
&amp; Description:     Education for All in 1990. The objectives of this program were to&#13;
expand the gross primary school enrollment rate from 28% to 53%&#13;
by the year 2000, to increase the efficiency of resource use within&#13;
the sector, to increase overall Government support for basic&#13;
education, and to improve quality. The strategy has been updated&#13;
in a Statement of Education Sector Policy. This policy will be&#13;
supported through the implementation of the second phase of a&#13;
multidonor sector investment program. The long-term objectives&#13;
of the integrated sector program are to: (a) increase primary school&#13;
enrollment and completion rates, with a strong focus on girls and&#13;
students in rural areas; (b) improve teaching and student learning in&#13;
primary and lower secondary schools; and (c) strengthen education&#13;
system management. In support of these overall objectives, the&#13;
current  project  will  finance  activities  with  short-term&#13;
implementation goals as follows.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
1.    To increase primary school enrollment and completion&#13;
rates, the project will:&#13;
(a)   build and rehabilitate primary schools; and&#13;
(b)   improve community-level capacity for school maintenance&#13;
and upkeep functions.&#13;
2.    To improve teaching and student learning, the project&#13;
will:&#13;
(a)   provide textbooks at both the primary and lower secondary&#13;
levels;&#13;
(b)   support primary school staff development and school&#13;
improvement; and&#13;
(c)   increase student learning capacity through a school-based&#13;
micronutrient supplement and deworming program.&#13;
3.    To strengthen  education  system  management, the&#13;
project will:&#13;
(a)   create the capacity for systematically monitoring student&#13;
learning;&#13;
(b)   develop a viable communications system within the sector;&#13;
(c)   improve sector planning, budgeting and monitoring; and&#13;
(d)   support pre-investment studies for establishment of closer&#13;
Ministry/private sector links.&#13;
Benefits       There are two main benefits. The first benefit will be the provision of&#13;
and Risks:     more and better education, which in the long term will contribute to&#13;
poverty reduction. The gross primary school enrollment rate will rise&#13;
from  40%  to 53%  during the project period.  Rural students'&#13;
participation will increase from 20% to 40%, and the gross primary&#13;
school enrollment rate of girls, currently at 29%, will reach 42% at the&#13;
primary level. The quality of education will be improved by providing&#13;
an initial stock of textbooks at the primary and lower-secondary levels,&#13;
promoting school-level initiatives, and increasing student learning&#13;
capacity by improving the health and nutrition of schoolchildren.&#13;
Support for school-level initiatives will develop innovative teaching&#13;
practices and provide for continuing stakeholder participation in&#13;
improving the quality of learning and teaching. The second benefit will&#13;
be the further development of capacity within the Ministry of Pre-&#13;
University Education and Vocational Training to plan, monitor, and&#13;
manage the sector and sector outputs in a sustainable manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
There are two main risks. The first risk is failure to attain project goals&#13;
if the budget allocations for the sector, analyzed thoroughly to ensure&#13;
their coherence with the recurrent cost implications of the project, are&#13;
not executed. This risk will be addressed by agreements reached with&#13;
Government regarding budget allocations. Primary education's share of&#13;
the total education budget will increase from 35% to 42% by the year&#13;
2000. The Government will allocate sufficient funds in its budget for&#13;
1997, 1998 and 1999 for the creation of 600 additional primary school&#13;
teacher positions for each of these years. Prior to the start of the 1997-&#13;
98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 school years, the Government will recruit&#13;
600 additional primary school teachers. The Public Expenditure Review&#13;
currently being implemented will also strengthen the Government's&#13;
capacity to assess the priority of education in the budget allocations.&#13;
Budget targets have been developed by Government with the full&#13;
participation of all major donors. Budget execution will be monitored&#13;
on a semi-annual basis, subject to joint annual reviews by the donors and&#13;
Government. A second risk is the current weakness of decentralized&#13;
education units in the management of budget resources. This risk is&#13;
addressed by ongoing efforts to strengthen the prefectoral education&#13;
offices (DPEs) together with the Department of Financial and&#13;
Administrative Affairs (DAAF), and the use of short-term technical&#13;
assistance to transfer skills to staff.   The Small Grants Staff&#13;
Development and School Improvement Program provides an additional&#13;
mechanism for careful monitoring of new approaches for managing&#13;
decentralized expenditures.&#13;
Poverty        Program of Targeted Interventions. The operation will address&#13;
Category:      poverty/human resources issues and gender. The emphasis on primary&#13;
education, particularly in rural areas, has been shown elsewhere to be&#13;
one of the most effective ways of tackling poverty issues. The provision&#13;
of an initial stock of textbooks, together with the school health and&#13;
nutrition program, will have its greatest impact on the poorest&#13;
households, providing better health, increasing poor children's access to&#13;
primary school and enhancing their learning capacity. Further, every&#13;
project component has been analyzed in terms of gender impact and&#13;
specifically designed to maximize girls' participation in schooling and&#13;
the later benefit they will derive from their primary schooling experience.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
EQUrrY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
L. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government of Guinea has requested IDA financing over five years to support&#13;
implementation of its ongoing education sector reform. This will be the second phase of a&#13;
multidonor financed program initiated under the Education Sector Adjustment Program&#13;
(Programme d'ajustement sectoriel de l'education, PASE, 1990-1994) and will cover the&#13;
period 1995-2000. The project will include support for primary and lower secondary&#13;
schooling. Its objectives are to: (a) increase primary school enrollment and completion&#13;
rates, with a strong focus on girls and students in rural areas; (b) improve teaching and&#13;
student learning in primary and lower secondary schools; and (c) strengthen education&#13;
system management. Attainment of these objectives also implies ongoing support for&#13;
strengthening the already considerable capacity of the Ministry of Pre-University&#13;
Education and Vocational Training (Ministere de 1'enseignement pre-universitaire et de&#13;
la formation professionnelle, MEPUFP) to gather and analyze data, to communicate&#13;
effectively, and to plan and monitor expenditures. All the components are designed to&#13;
strengthen girls' schooling and enhance the role of the individual school as the locus of&#13;
change.&#13;
1.2   The Country Assistance Strategy (March 1994), recognizing the central role that&#13;
human resources play in the economic development of Guinea, emphasizes the need for a&#13;
strong commitment to human resource development. In particular, it calls for long-term&#13;
support to the education and health sectors including "greater attention to the&#13;
institutionalization of programs designed to enhance girls' education". This project will be&#13;
the fourth IDA-financed operation for educational development in Guinea. It builds on&#13;
lessons learned through the Education Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr.2155-GUI, 1990-94),&#13;
an Education Project (Cr.849-GUI, 1978-84) and a Second Education Project (Cr.1341-&#13;
GUI, 1983-90).&#13;
1.3   The proposed IDA credit of US$42.5 million will finance 30%  of the total&#13;
program cost, including 28% of the foreign exchange cost (US$23.6 million equivalent)&#13;
and 43% of the local cost (US$18.9 million equivalent). Total program cost is estimated&#13;
at US$141.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$83.3 million&#13;
equivalent. Guinea (the Government and communities) will finance 18% of the program&#13;
cost, almost entirely for incremental teacher salaries and pedagogical materials, including&#13;
21% of local cost (US$9.5 million equivalent), plus taxes and duties (US$13.7 million&#13;
equivalent). The six cofinanciers [AfDB, Canada (ACDI), European Union (Lom6 IV),&#13;
France, Japan, and the United States of America (USAID)] will finance 52% of the total&#13;
program cost, including 68% of the foreign exchange cost (US$56.8 million equivalent)&#13;
and 36% of local cost (US$15.9 million equivalent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
II. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
2.1   Guinea is a country with 6.2 million inhabitants and a high population growth of&#13;
2.8% per year (1993). It has long been one of Africa's most conspicuous underachievers.&#13;
Guinea has one of the highest concentrations of mineral resources in Africa (bauxite,&#13;
diamond and gold) and a high agricultural potential. The mining sector accounts for 22%&#13;
of GDP, agriculture for less than 30%. Yet Guinea's per capita income is only US$537.&#13;
Its low social indicators have caused it to be ranked last in the United Nations&#13;
Development Program's Human Development Index from 1992 through 1994. Indicators&#13;
such as life expectancy (44 years), infant mortality (133 per 1,000 live births) and illiteracy&#13;
(76%), reflect the poor living standards of its people.&#13;
B. EcoNoMIc DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
2.2   Since the beginning of 1986, the Government of Guinea has been implementing an&#13;
ambitious program of economic and financial reform. IDA and the IMF supported the&#13;
adjustment through a SAL I (1986) and two stand-by arrangements in 1986 and 1987.&#13;
This program was aimed at improving the incentive framnework for private sector&#13;
development (including the health sector), phasing out state involvement in commercial&#13;
enterprises, instituting better management of the administration (including a reduction in&#13;
the size of the civil service) and developing a strong human resource base. The reform&#13;
program has resulted in a full transition from a command to a market economy, increases&#13;
in non-mining revenues, the privatization or liquidation of a large number of public&#13;
enterprises, and a comprehensive reform of and reduction in the size of the public&#13;
administration from 95,000 to 52,000 individuals. While progress in the first phase of the&#13;
adjustment program was encouraging, some of the more difficult institution-building and&#13;
politically sensitive reforms of the second phase have not been implemented at the rhythm&#13;
anticipated. Consequently, the reform process has slowed, with some key measures&#13;
remaining to be taken. A SAL II was approved by IDA in August 1988. Since July 1994,&#13;
Guinea is implementing the second year program of an Enhanced Structural Adjustment&#13;
Facility arrangement approved by the ILMF in November 1991, suspended in early 1992&#13;
and replaced by a shadow program until June 1994. Overall, the Government's program&#13;
has resulted in real economic growth, averaging 3.8% per annum from 1987-1992, an&#13;
increase in real per capita income of about 1% per annum.&#13;
C. EDUCATION SECTOR&#13;
1. Structure&#13;
2.3   The educational system consists of six years of primary schooling, a four-year&#13;
cycle for lower secondary and vocational training, a three-year upper secondary cycle, and&#13;
five years of tertiary education. There is no upper secondary vocational training, but there&#13;
are a number of post-secondary vocational programs of varying length (Annex 1-B).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
During the 1993-94 school year, Guinea's pre-university educational system&#13;
accommodated 589,000 students, with 471,000 students in primary school, 109,900&#13;
students in secondary school, and 8,100 students in technical schools. Gross enrollment&#13;
rates for primary and secondary schooling were 40% and 10% respectively. The total&#13;
number of teaching staff during the 1993-94 school year for the primary and secondary&#13;
levels was 14,800, with fewer than 2,900 (19%) female teachers (Annex 2).&#13;
2. Administration&#13;
2.4   The administration of Guinea's educational system  is divided between two&#13;
Ministries: the MEPUFP and the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and&#13;
Culture (Ministere de l1enseignement sup&amp;rieur, de la recherche scientifique et de la&#13;
culture, MESRSC). The MEPUFP (see Annex 1-C for organizational flow chart) directs&#13;
all pre-university structures through eight regional Academic Inspectorates which in turn&#13;
administer 38 prefectoral-level Directorates of Education (Direction pr6fectorale de&#13;
l'education, DPE) and 210 sub-prefectoral Pedagogic Delegates. The MESRSC is&#13;
responsible for the two Guinean universities (Nasser University, in Conakry and Nyerere&#13;
University, in Kankan), three specialized institutes (the Teacher Training Institute in&#13;
Maneah, the Giscard d'Estaing Agriculture and Veterinary Institute in Faranah, and the&#13;
Mining and Geology Institute in Boke), and a number of scientific research centers.&#13;
3. Sector Development Issues&#13;
2.5   From independence in 1958, the Government pursued a unique educational policy&#13;
that included instruction in national languages in all primary schools, agricultural work as&#13;
a part of the curriculum at all levels, and the linking of the education system to the&#13;
political party at the local, regional, and national levels. Primary education was, in theory&#13;
at least, compulsory. Enrollment rates expanded rapidly and a large number of technicians&#13;
and professionals were trained under this policy. Female schooling was encouraged&#13;
notably by setting a lower achievement requirement for access to secondary school and&#13;
reserving a quota for female students at the University level. However, the sweeping&#13;
nature of the reform, combined with rapid enrollment growth and poorly trained teachers,&#13;
resulted in a low quality of education, inadequate external efficiency, and inefficient&#13;
allocation of resources. Furthermore, the transition to French at the end of primary school&#13;
was poorly prepared, resulting in reduced comprehension in secondary school and poorly&#13;
qualified university students. Finally, girls' schooling became suspect as a consequence of&#13;
the lower standards set for them.&#13;
2.6   The 1958 policies were abandoned when the first regime ended in 1984 and the&#13;
Government launched a program of reform and rehabilitation to improve access to&#13;
education and to relate it to employment opportunities. French was re-introduced as the&#13;
language of instruction but two generations of Guinean teachers did not speak fluent&#13;
French, thereby compromising their ability to perform well in the new system. Other&#13;
reforms included placing the educational administration under a single ministry,&#13;
reorganizing educational management, consolidating and rationalizing higher education,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
extending secondary education by one year, and implementing a program of in-service&#13;
training for teachers. However, resource allocation was slow to follow these policies and&#13;
the reform package of 1984 was only partially implemented. The Governmnent, in a&#13;
renewed attempt to improve the sector, announced a new educational policy in September&#13;
1989. This attempt has been much more successful.&#13;
(a) Access&#13;
2.7   Government has succeeded in reversing the declining primary school enrollment&#13;
trends of the 1980s. Although gross primary school enrollment had fallen to 28% by the&#13;
1988-89 school year, it increased to 40% by the 1993-94 school year, an increase of 70%&#13;
in nominal enrollments. Government is currently ahead of schedule for attaining its target&#13;
of 53% gross enrollment by the year 2000. This was made possible through: (i) an&#13;
ambitious school construction program supported by community groups, non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs) and donors, accompanied by development and&#13;
implementation of low-cost construction norms; (ii) the redeployment of over 2,000&#13;
teachers from administrative posts and secondary schools to primary school classrooms;&#13;
and (iii) a reallocation of budgetary resources in favor of non-salary operating&#13;
expenditures, particularly at the primary level.&#13;
(b) Equity&#13;
2.8   Gender. Thirty-two percent is the most stubborn statistic in Guinean education.&#13;
It represents the percentage of primary school students who are girls and hasn't changed in&#13;
the last ten years. In 6 of Guinea's 38 prefectures, gross primary enrollment for girls was&#13;
10% or less in 1992-93 (see Annex 2 for female enrollments by region). The percentage&#13;
of female teachers (ust under 23%) is even lower than the percentage of female students.&#13;
In 1993-94, there were 2,292 female teachers at the primary level out of a total of 9,972.&#13;
In rural areas (1992-93), only 314 of 5,002 teachers were female (6%). While statistics on&#13;
the evolution of girls' participation in secondary schools are not yet available, the figures&#13;
for the post-primary vocational training centers are eloquent: female students represented&#13;
12% of all students in 1985 and 1.7% in 1992.&#13;
2.9   During PASE implementation, Government established a Commission on Equity,&#13;
with USAID support. In order to better understand why girls' participation is weak in the&#13;
school system, this highly influential commission helped design studies for the current&#13;
project that took girls' issues as a proxy for all issues facing the sector. For example, in&#13;
order to learn about the classroom experiences of students, an in-depth, five-month study&#13;
of girls' experiences in classrooms was conducted. While the focus was on female&#13;
students, the recommendations of the study have proven to be of operational relevance for&#13;
all students.  Other studies conducted from this general perspective include: (a) a&#13;
statistical analysis of determinants of girls' education; (b) an analysis of local constraints to&#13;
girls' participation in primary schooling and identification of initiatives to increase girls'&#13;
education; (c) a review of employment opportunities for female graduates of vocational&#13;
training; (d) preparation of an operational manual and guidelines for a small grants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
program to train staff and improve school quality and girls' schooling; and (e) development&#13;
of proposals for greater support to private schooling, which accommodates a higher&#13;
percentage of female students. In each case, girls' participation has served as the prism&#13;
through which the issue is analyzed, but operational recommendations have been&#13;
developed that are meaningful for all students.&#13;
2.10  Rural/Urban. The bias against rural students in the system is even more striking&#13;
than that against girls: fewer than 20% of all students in primary schools are from rural&#13;
areas, even though the rural population represents more than half of all potential students;&#13;
only 13% of girls in primary school are from rural areas. The regions of Middle and&#13;
Upper Guinea, which are largely rural, have gross enrollment rates of 27% and 28%&#13;
respectively, while the Conakry region, entirely urban, has an enrollment rate of 73% (see&#13;
Annex 2 for details).&#13;
(c) Quality&#13;
2.11  The most important indicator of educational quality is student learning outcomes.&#13;
Government does not yet have any reliable way to measure these. Available input&#13;
indicators would imply relatively low quality overall: nationwide, for instance, students&#13;
average less than one textbook apiece and 24% of classrooms are classified as being in bad&#13;
condition. However, Guinea uses both double shifting (in urban areas) and multigrade&#13;
classrooms (in rural areas) to increase efficiency, with the result that the average number&#13;
of primary students per teacher is 49 and varies by region from 39 to 64. Repetition rates&#13;
have remained near 20% for the past three years, with a marginally higher rate for girls&#13;
(23% in 1992-93). Drop-out rates are considerably higher for girls.&#13;
(d) Budgetary and Financial Issues&#13;
2.12  Budget. The budget process for the education sector in Guinea has improved&#13;
significantly over the past three years. Annual budgets are prepared well in advance,&#13;
based on careful analysis of each budget line, which is backed by a corresponding action&#13;
plan. The MEPUFP's budget preparation process is carefully monitored by the Steering&#13;
Committee for the PASE and is considered within Government to be an example of best&#13;
practice in this area. The execution of the annual budget is also carefully monitored, with&#13;
quarterly reports on commitment and expenditure levels generally available within several&#13;
months.&#13;
2.13  An increasing portion of education sector procurement is handled at the regional&#13;
and prefectoral levels through decentralized budget allocations, orders of payment, and&#13;
payment (dil6gation de credit, ordonnancement etpaiemenf). Capacity for implementing&#13;
this approach was considerably strengthened through the PASE, with initial training&#13;
supported by USAID of MEPUFP accountants at the regional and prefectoral levels.&#13;
These accountants were trained in budget preparation and execution, and submission of&#13;
quarterly financial reports. Still, external audits are virtually non-existent and the internal&#13;
audit system is embryonic. The budget unit is at present only able to perform preliminary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
audits on a "spot check" basis and has limited capacity for conducting financial analysis.&#13;
USAID will continue to provide support for the budget unit in its efforts to further&#13;
improve the absorptive capacity of the MEPUFP at the decentralized level. Additional&#13;
personnel with responsibility for conducting regular audits at the prefectoral level have&#13;
been recruited for the DAAF [para. 6.1 (a)].&#13;
2.14 Finance. Tuition at all levels is free and Government finances almost all recurrent&#13;
spending for education; Government financing of the sector increased from 12.9% of the&#13;
overall national recurrent budget in 1990 (compared to an average of 18% in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa) to 26.1% of the 1993 recurrent budget (not including debt and investment&#13;
payments). Higher education continues to receive a disproportionate amount of both&#13;
recurrent and investment budgets, although its share has been steadily reduced in recent&#13;
years. All financial targets established for the sector under the PASE were met and&#13;
surpassed, with the result that expenditures for non-salary operating costs improved&#13;
significantly from 2% of pre-university expenditures to 15%. The budget distribution&#13;
moved from 32% for primary education in 1990 to 35% in 1993. A further increase to&#13;
42% of sectoral expenditures is planned by 1999. Maintenance and construction are&#13;
managed by the Ministry, by donors, and by NGOs, but almost wholly funded by donors,&#13;
communities, and NGOs.&#13;
(e) Planning and Resource Management&#13;
2.15  Personnel Management.  The redeployment of 2,200 sectoral personnel to&#13;
primary school classrooms in 1992-93 was an example of the priority Guinea's education&#13;
sector has given to improved personnel management. The 1993 decision to base future&#13;
hiring on a probationary period of supervised classroom teaching is further evidence of the&#13;
sector's attention to improving teaching skills and to pushing responsibility for decision-&#13;
making as far down in the system as is feasible. However, an extremely underdeveloped&#13;
communications system makes it difficult to establish a give-and-take of feedback between&#13;
central, regional and prefectoral offices.&#13;
2.16 A major handicap for personnel management is the lack of a systematic program&#13;
for upgrading teacher skills through in-service training. For instance, virtually none of the&#13;
2,200 underutilized administrators and secondary teachers redeployed to primary&#13;
classrooms received short-term training. Most teachers receive only sporadic training&#13;
under the best of circumstances. This is due in part to overlapping responsibility for&#13;
teacher training between the inefficient National Institute for Research and Pedagogy&#13;
(Institut national de la recherche et de I 'action pedagogique, INRAP), the inspectorates,&#13;
and the directorates of Primary and Secondary Education. The creation in 1994 of a new&#13;
directorate for personnel training clarifies these responsibilities and revamps the INRAP.&#13;
USAID technical assistance will focus on strengthening the INRAP, which is particularly&#13;
important if it is to contribute fully to the improvement of teaching quality.&#13;
2.17  Statistical Data. Reasonably good school mapping and school statistics data are&#13;
received and published each year, but to date, this information is underutilized and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
capacity for meaningful analysis is limited. The school mapping information is used&#13;
throughout the country for reaching decisions about school rehabilitation and new school&#13;
construction but is not easily accessible. The statistical unit (Service des statistiques et de&#13;
la planification, SSP) produces an accurate statistical yearbook within six months of the&#13;
end of the school year, but this is generally too late to be useful for planning the new&#13;
school year and only a few of the potential end users appear to take these data into&#13;
account for decision-making purposes.  The SSP has given itself the objective of&#13;
producing the yearbook and an accompanying computerized data base by May of the&#13;
current school year, and of strengthening end use and analysis. The SSP wil assume a&#13;
new role, that of an information clearinghouse, through this process. This goal is within&#13;
reach but will require short-term training of the statistical unit personnel in order to allow&#13;
them to produce the annual yearbook without relying on technical assistance as in the past.&#13;
This training has begun under project preparation.&#13;
4. Government's Educational Policy and Strategies&#13;
2.18  The Government of Guinea published its current educational policy in 1989. The&#13;
key objective was to increase gross primary school enrollment from 28% in 1989 to 70%&#13;
in the year 2000. This has since been scaled back to a more manageable but still very&#13;
ambitious 53%. As of 1994, the Government was slightly ahead of target, with gross&#13;
primary enrollments at 40%. Special emphasis was placed on increasing access for girls&#13;
and rural children. The quality of teaching was to be improved by increasing the number&#13;
of students in teacher training schools, improving the living conditions of teachers,&#13;
improving pre- and in-service teacher training programs, and improving teaching materials&#13;
and educational infrastructure.  Other areas addressed by the current policy are&#13;
restructuring of the educational administration to improve efficiency, promotion of private&#13;
education, and reorganization of the educational budget according to the newly defined&#13;
sector priorities.&#13;
2.19 The Government's commitment to the 1989 policy was reconfirmed in 1990 when&#13;
it adopted the National Program for Education For All. This policy included as a target a&#13;
reduction in the adult illiteracy rate from 74% in 1990 to 37.5% in the year 2000. The&#13;
Government discussed its educational strategy with major donors in June 1994 as a part of&#13;
the preparation process for the current program phase. This updated strategy will bring&#13;
qualitative goals for education into sharper focus and will establish quantitative targets&#13;
adjusted in the light of three years' experience with the reform process, together with the&#13;
budget allocations needed for sector development for the next five years. A draft&#13;
Statement of Education Sector Policy, with monitorable indicators and budget projections&#13;
for the MEPUFP for 1995-2000 was submitted prior to negotiations [par 6.1 (b)] and&#13;
agreed upon between IDA and the Government [para. 6.2 (a)].&#13;
2.20 Higher Education. The number of institutions of higher education in Guinea was&#13;
reduced sharply in 1984, to five, with the closing of some thirty agricultural institutions of&#13;
higher education. Higher education continues to be a highly inefficient enterprise in&#13;
Guinea, however, absorbing 24% of the sectoral budget while producing a relatively low&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
number of graduates, of limited employability outside the public sector. A technical&#13;
assistance project in support of higher education reform was appraised by IDA in June&#13;
1994 and is expected to be presented to the Board in Fiscal Year 1996.&#13;
2.21  Vocational Training.   There are seventeen lower secondary Vocational&#13;
Education and Training (VET) institutions scattered throughout the country, along with a&#13;
small number of post-secondary programs. There are no upper-secondary VET schools.&#13;
Programs offered in the schools have remained static for many years; the schools operate&#13;
separate from and without regard for labor market needs, although Canada and IDA have&#13;
collaborated during the course of project preparation to help the Government prepare a&#13;
statement of VET sector reform. This document calls for a significant change in the way&#13;
the sector does business, to move toward a demand-driven rather than a supply-driven&#13;
approach. However, the sector at present does not possess adequate management&#13;
capacity to implement such a far-reaching change; the Government has committed itself to&#13;
develop such managerial capacity and establish basic quality assurance controls and&#13;
maintenance and upkeep functions.&#13;
2.22 NGOs. Guinea has a long history of close collaboration with NGOs, including&#13;
both national and intemational NGOs. Several NGOs have developed cost-efficient&#13;
scalable methods for school construction and maintenance, with a history of close&#13;
collaboration with communities (Aide et Action, CECI, and ADRA, among others). An&#13;
evaluation of NGO capacity was conducted as a part of project appraisal. The results of&#13;
this study were made available in country--they provide contacts and an implementation&#13;
history for over fifty national and international NGOs. Two NGOs (ADRA and CECI) are&#13;
currently taking part in a pilot project to test new approaches to management of school&#13;
construction processes.&#13;
D. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.23  The Equity and School Improvement Project will be the fourth IDA-financed&#13;
education project in Guinea. The first project (1978-84) focused on developing vocational&#13;
training capacity and equipping the Planning Office of the Ministry of Education and the&#13;
Project Management Unit.  The Project Performance Audit Report (#6492-GUI)&#13;
recommended that future projects concentrate on addressing a narrow range of issues&#13;
within the sector. In spite of this, the second IDA-financed education credit (1983-1990)&#13;
financed a wide range of activities including vocational training, manpower development,&#13;
education planning, and primary school improvement.  According to the Project&#13;
Completion Report (#10200-GUI), the high number of donors (three) and local actors&#13;
made the project too complex for existing management capability.   The main&#13;
recommendation was that project design and organization be adapted to the existing&#13;
institutional, economic, managerial, and implementation capacities. Ironically, the first&#13;
two credits met most of their quantitative goals but did not have a major impact on the&#13;
sector, where virtually all indicators of access and quality were in free fall.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.24  The third intervention in the sector, the PASE (1990-94), set out to reverse the&#13;
decline in educational access and quality by first strengthening institutional and&#13;
management capacity. Government developed a ten-year strategic design covering the&#13;
total education sector, with explicit attention to the macroeconomic context.  This&#13;
program has succeeded in reversing the declining enrollment trends of the 1980s (para.&#13;
2.18). This was made possible through: (a) an ambitious school construction program&#13;
supported by community groups, NGOs and donors, accompanied by development and&#13;
implementation of low-cost construction norms; (b) West Africa's most ambitious&#13;
redeployment program to date, with over 2,200 teachers shifted from administrative posts&#13;
and secondary schools to primary school classrooms; and (c) a reallocation of budgetary&#13;
resources in favor of the education sector, including large increases in non-salary&#13;
operating expenditures. In line with Government-wide civil service reform measures, the&#13;
MEPUFP has overhauled its teacher management procedures. Data collection and&#13;
analysis have been dramatically improved.  Government support for education has&#13;
increased from 13% (1989) to 26% (1993) of the national budget, with marked&#13;
improvements in preparation and monitoring of education sector budgets. The sectoral&#13;
budget distribution moved from 32% for primary education in 1990 to 35% in 1993;&#13;
expenditures for non-salary operating costs increased from 2% of pre-university&#13;
expenditures in 1990 to 15% in 1993.&#13;
2.25  The key lesson to be learned from implementation of the PASE is that a complex&#13;
range of interventions can be successfully undertaken, provided that they are situated&#13;
within a coherent policy matrix and given intensive supervision. The PASE also&#13;
demonstrated the importance of a long-term framework for education system support,&#13;
covering fifteen to twenty years.  A further lesson learned from perhaps the least&#13;
successful initiative of the PASE is that unless girls' issues are framed in such a way that&#13;
they are integral to the reform process, only marginal improvements can be expected in&#13;
girls' schooling: after the PASE, almost no change can be demonstrated in the management&#13;
and teaching culture linked to girls' schooling.&#13;
2.26  The proposed project will address these weaknesses by: (a) strengthening both the&#13;
central Directorate and the decentralized financial services of the MEPUFP (Division et&#13;
services des affaires administratives etfinancieres, DAAF and SAAF); (b) contracting the&#13;
management of primary school construction to NGOs with a proven track record and&#13;
hired under procedures acceptable to IDA; (c) procuring textbooks through International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB); (d) taking girls' issues as a proxy for all issues facing the&#13;
education sector; (e) developing school-level initiatives to improve teaching and student&#13;
learning; and (f) conducting joint annual reviews by Government and all key donors of&#13;
annual work programs and budgets (Annex 10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

m. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJEcTivEs AND SCOPE&#13;
3.1    Objectives. Research has consistently shown that support for primary and lower&#13;
secondary education is the single best investment a developing country can make for&#13;
future economic growth, with the greatest rates of return associated with girls' schooling.&#13;
Further, the evidence is overwhelming that such support is most effective when&#13;
investments are targeted at the school level. To this end, the project will support the&#13;
Guinean Government's carefully designed approach to human capital formation as it&#13;
implements the second phase of its ten-year educational development program. The&#13;
overall objectives of this phase are as follows: (i) increasing primary school enrollment and&#13;
completion rates, with a strong focus on girls and students in rural areas; (ii) improving&#13;
teaching and student learning at primary and lower secondary schools; and (iii)&#13;
strengthening education system management. The short-term implementation goals for&#13;
the IDA credit are as follows: (a) build and rehabilitate primary schools; (b) improve&#13;
community-level capacity for school maintenance and upkeep functions; (c) provide&#13;
textbooks at both the primary and lower secondary levels; (d) support school-based&#13;
innovations in teaching at the primary level; (e) increase student learning capacity through&#13;
a school-based micronutrient supplement and deworming program; (f) create the capacity&#13;
for systematically monitoring student learning; (g) develop a viable communications&#13;
system within the sector; (h) improve sector planning, budgeting and monitoring; and (i)&#13;
support pre-investment studies for establishment of closer Ministry/private sector links.&#13;
All project components are designed to support girls' participation in schooling; all&#13;
components also strengthen the role of the individual school as the locus of change. The&#13;
Government's policies and programs are described in a Statement of Education Sector&#13;
Policy (Annex 3) presented during the donor meeting organized by the Guinean&#13;
Government in June 1994. Monitorable indicators (Annex 5) for project performance&#13;
were submitted prior to negotiations [para. 6.1 (b)] and agreed between IDA and the&#13;
Government during negotiations [para. 6.2 (a)]. These include, among others, teacher&#13;
staffing, classroom construction, enrollment rates, and textbook production and&#13;
distribution.&#13;
3.2   Scope. The project will provide broad-based support for primary and lower&#13;
secondary education. The emphasis will be put on access and completion for rural&#13;
students and for girls, designed in keeping with project preparation studies indicating that,&#13;
among other factors, girls' participation and attainment are far more sensitive than that of&#13;
boys to: (a) the availability of a full six-year primary cycle; (b) shorter distance between&#13;
the home and the school; (c) higher quality of teaching; and (d) the availability of adequate&#13;
sanitation facilities. The project will increase the number of classrooms, building a greater&#13;
number of smaller three-teacher multigrade schools rather than larger six-teacher schools&#13;
in those cases where the smaller schools would allow for significantly shorter distances&#13;
between school and home. It will put a strong emphasis on school-level improvements to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
teaching and learning and will rehabilitate existing schools and install or upgrade sanitation&#13;
facilities.&#13;
3.3   Donor interventions have been coordinated through a series of meetings and joint&#13;
planning sessions and can be broken down roughly as follows (Annex 3). USAID will&#13;
provide financing in support of improved management sector-wide, at the central ministry,&#13;
regional, and prefectoral levels: development of textbooks and teachers' guides; in-service&#13;
training for teachers and principals; training for financial managers and planning personnel;&#13;
long-term technical assistance for financial management training within the DAAF; training&#13;
for the school statistics unit within the SSP; and support for girls' initiatives. The only&#13;
long-term technical assistance to be provided by USAID will be for training personnel,&#13;
with specific evaluation criteria based on achievement of training objectives and the&#13;
transfer of technical skills. France will provide technical assistance focusing particularly&#13;
on the design and delivery of pre-service teacher training, program planning and program&#13;
evaluation. Canada will provide support over two years to strengthen VET management&#13;
within the MEPUFP and girls' participation in vocational training courses. In addition,&#13;
the FED will build approximately 200 primary classrooms per year in rural areas and&#13;
construct a new training institute for secondary school teachers, as well as finance training&#13;
and support of primary school teachers.   The Japanese government will build&#13;
approximately 75 primary classrooms per year, mostly in urban areas in the interior of the&#13;
country.  The AfDB  will support classroom  construction, primary-level textbook&#13;
provision, and girls' initiatives. Donors' contributions and schedules of intervention were&#13;
assessed during appraisal in terms of their coherence and relevance (see Annex 3). All&#13;
donors remain in close communication. Overlapping responsibilities have been largely&#13;
eliminated and donor programs are complementary. IDA will be responsible for working&#13;
with the Government on overall donor coordination.&#13;
3.4   IDA will provide financing to the Government's education development program&#13;
that is targeted to the school and classroom levels, strengthening the role of school-level&#13;
personnel in introducing and managing change and improving quality: improved classroom&#13;
teaching and classroom management, purchase and maintenance of textbooks, evaluation&#13;
of student learning, improvement of student learning capacity, and development of&#13;
maintenance and upkeep functions. IDA will provide only short-term technical assistance.&#13;

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.5    The project components are summarized below:&#13;
Project Summary (total cost USS53.0 million)."&#13;
1. Increase Primary School Enrollment and Completion Rates (US$29.3 million) by:&#13;
- building and rehabilitating primary schools; and&#13;
- improving community-level capacity for school maintenance and upkeep functions.&#13;
2. Improve Teaching and Student Learning (USS18.7 million) by:&#13;
- providing textbooks at both the primary and lower secondary levels;&#13;
- supporting primary school staff development and school improvement; and&#13;
- increasing student learning capacity through a school-based micronutrient supplement&#13;
and deworming program.&#13;
3. Strengthen Education System Management (US$4.7 million) by:&#13;
- creating the capacity for systematically monitoring student learning;&#13;
- developing a viable communications system within the sector;&#13;
- improving sector planning, budgeting and monitoring; and&#13;
- supporting pre-investment studies for establishment of closer Ministry/private sector&#13;
links.&#13;
"Includes taxes and duties, base costs, contingencies and two PPF advances totaling US$329,000.&#13;
1. Increase Primary School Enrollment and Completion Rates (US$29.3&#13;
million)&#13;
3.6    Scope and Objectives. This component supports the Government's objective of&#13;
increasing the gross primary school enrollment rate from 29% in 1989/90 to 53% in&#13;
1999/2000 and to increase the gross primary school enrollment rate of girls from 18 to&#13;
42%. Overall gross primary school enrollment in 1993-94 stood at 40%; girls' gross&#13;
primary school enrollment stood at 29% (their percentage of total enrollment has remained&#13;
unchanged at 32% for four consecutive years). This increase will lead to the hiring of&#13;
additional primary school teachers over the program  life.  The recruitment of 600&#13;
additional primary school teachers for the 1995/1996 school year is a condition for credit&#13;
effectiveness [para. 6.3 (a)]. An additional 1,800 teachers will be recruited over the&#13;
project duration. The majority of teacher candidates will have already received pre-service&#13;
training prior to the year of in-service training (there is currently a pool of 2,000 graduates&#13;
of pre-service training who have not been hired), and an additional 350 new candidates&#13;
will continue receiving training each year during the five years of the project, as per&#13;
existing capacity. Government has sponsored studies financed by a grant from Japan&#13;
under the Policy and Human Resources Development Fund to provide operational&#13;
approaches to increase girls' enrollment (see below). A field survey among communities&#13;
to identify factors positively influencing girls' participation was conducted under a PPF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
3.7   Support for Girls' Schooling.  Studies conducted during project preparation&#13;
demonstrated that girls' enrollment is highly sensitive to the physical environment of the&#13;
school. In particular, parents in Guinea want: (a) adequate sanitary facilities for girls; (b) a&#13;
safe and comfortable physical environment; and (c) schools that are relatively close to&#13;
home. They are also much less likely to send their girls to school if the local school does&#13;
not offer a complete primary cycle. The construction program responds to these concerns&#13;
by: (a) initiating a program to provide adequate sanitary facilities at all schools; (b)&#13;
involving parents in a program of upkeep and maintenance; and (c) emphasizing smaller&#13;
multigrade classrooms in rural areas so that schools can be closer to individual&#13;
communities and yet still offer a complete primary cycle. In addition, the recruitment of&#13;
teachers will be done under new guidelines adopted already by Government to increase the&#13;
number of female teachers in rural areas where they had previously been virtually non-&#13;
existent.&#13;
3.8   The project will finance the following two components: (a) building and&#13;
rehabilitating primary schools; and (b) improving community-level capacity for school&#13;
maintenance and upkeep functions.&#13;
(a)   Build and rehabilitate primary schools (US$28.0 million)&#13;
3.9   Scope and Objectives.  Government aims to increase total primary school&#13;
enrollment by 270,000 over the life of the project, moving from 471,100 in 1993/94 to&#13;
740,000 in 1999/2000, for a gross primary school enrollment rate of 53%, and to increase&#13;
girls' participation. The Government is increasing the use of multigrade teaching in rural&#13;
areas from 74 classrooms to 574 classrooms, or approximately 100 additional multigrade&#13;
classrooms each year. This is in line with experience gained under the pilot multigrade&#13;
program in the PASE and will represent an economy of 500 classrooms and teachers over&#13;
the project lifespan while boosting girls' enrollment by offering a complete primary cycle&#13;
where it is not yet available. These measures, together with other cost efficiency gains and&#13;
the development of the private sector will mean the need for 3,900 new primary&#13;
classrooms in the public sector over five years, or 780 per year (for practical purposes,&#13;
and because of the varying number of classrooms per school, this document refers only to&#13;
classrooms; in practice, however, the emphasis will be on the individual school as a&#13;
coherent unit).  Government will provide these classrooms as follows.  Current&#13;
commitments by donors, other than IDA and NGOs, provide financing for approximately&#13;
550 classrooms annually. IDA will finance an average of 120 classrooms annually;&#13;
communities will make annual contributions for the purchase of local material. The&#13;
difference (110) can be made up by direct community funding of schools, since during the&#13;
past four years, communities have funded approximately 300 classrooms per year (1,200&#13;
out of 2,400 classrooms built since 1990). Site acquisition is not considered an issue in&#13;
Guinea.&#13;
3.10  In addition to construction of new schools, the Govermnent's program calls for&#13;
school rehabilitation. This follows a long period of neglect of school infrastructure; it had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
initially been intended that school rehabilitation be begun under the PASE but this proved&#13;
not to be possible because of the lack of technical capacity, standardized norms, and&#13;
detailed school mapping information. These issues have now been addressed: norms for&#13;
school rehabilitation and maintenance have been prepared, personnel at the central and&#13;
regional offices of the school construction unit within the Ministry (Service national des&#13;
infrastructures et des &amp;quipements scolaires, SNIES) have received training, and school&#13;
mapping information has been updated to allow identification of schools where&#13;
investments in rehabilitation can be expected to be particularly cost-effective. Upgrading&#13;
of technical capacity for rehabilitation will continue throughout the life of the present&#13;
operation. At the same time, local NGOs will work closely with communities for all new&#13;
schools to ensure that they assume responsibility for ongoing maintenance needs (see&#13;
below). All communities receiving rehabilitation or construction funds will sign a contract&#13;
with the Government accepting responsibility for a specific program of maintenance,&#13;
according to norms already developed. This will ensure the sustainability of current&#13;
construction and rehabilitation efforts and will obviate the need for major rehabilitation&#13;
initiatives beyond the life of this project.  The primary school construction and&#13;
rehabilitation program for 1995-2000 was agreed upon during negotiations [para. 6.2 (a)].&#13;
Schools constructed or rehabilitated under the project will include sanitary facilities. The&#13;
joint annual reviews of the project will assess the progress made against monitorable&#13;
indicators for school construction and rehabilitation outlined in Annex 5.&#13;
3.11  In the past, the SNIES had the responsibility of directly overseeing ongoing school&#13;
construction at sites throughout the country. This approach proved not to be scalable, and&#13;
was the source of continuing delay as the Government sought to expand the number of&#13;
primary schools. Under the PASE, the Government and the donors developed norms and&#13;
standards for construction of primary schools and tested several pilot approaches to&#13;
school construction, working with local enterprises and with local and international&#13;
NGOs. In the course of this experimentation, the role of the Ministry's construction unit&#13;
shifted from that of school builder to that of manager and planner. The day-to-day&#13;
functioning of this unit was completely restructured. Regional offices were created with&#13;
the responsibility of overall quality control based on the agreed norms. The SNIES was&#13;
given responsibility for programming, overall management of school properties, and&#13;
development of norms and standards for construction and rehabilitation. It was re-&#13;
organized under two main divisions: Operations and Programs. The Programs division&#13;
handles scheduling, budgets, evaluation and information flows. The Operations division is&#13;
responsible for the implementation of programs and projects, delegating direct oversight&#13;
to the private sector, and implicating communities much more fully than in the past. As a&#13;
part of project preparation, these changes were incorporated into the legal texts organizing&#13;
the sector.&#13;
3.12  A participative construction seminar bringing together the principal donors and&#13;
stakeholders was held during project preparation. A key issue discussed was to find viable&#13;
partners for construction in the rural areas, where there are almost no viable small or&#13;
medium-sized construction companies. It was agreed that the most promising approach&#13;
over the lifespan of the current project is to work with existing international and local non-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
governmental organizations who have a proven track record in school construction and&#13;
maintenance. They will in turn coordinate with local micro-enterprises and will manage&#13;
on-site construction activities. The operational details associated with this approach have&#13;
been finalized under PPF funding.&#13;
3.13  Project Support. The project will finance: (a) the construction of 600 primary&#13;
school classrooms; (b) the rehabilitation of 1200 primary school classrooms; (c) school&#13;
furniture for the 1800 classrooms to be constructed or rehabilitated; (d) related fees for&#13;
the management of works by NGOs; (e) fees for short-term technical assistance to oversee&#13;
overall progress; and (f) a series of school rehabilitation seminars in each of the 8 regional&#13;
capitals. A draft sample contract with NGOs for the management of primary school works&#13;
was submitted to IDA prior to negotiations [para. 6.1 (c)].&#13;
(b)  Improve community-level capacity for school maintenance and&#13;
upkeep functions (US$1.3 million)&#13;
3.14  Scope and Objectives.  Support will be provided under the project for&#13;
development of a viable maintenance and upkeep function within the sector. Communities&#13;
will be responsible for the regular maintenance of primary schools; they will receive&#13;
training and other support under the project through the intermediary of local NGOs. All&#13;
new school construction will include establishment of a maintenance function at the school&#13;
level, under the aegis of the NGOs responsible for overseeing the construction program.&#13;
The SNIES will assume responsibility for overall management of school properties and for&#13;
updating maintenance norms and procedures. For lower secondary vocational schools, the&#13;
focus will be on the maintenance and upkeep of equipment. Detailed criteria for upkeep&#13;
and repair/replacement of parts and equipment will be developed and monitored on a&#13;
school-by-school basis by the VET directorate, with those VET schools that successfully&#13;
follow an equipment maintenance program eligible for matching funds for equipment&#13;
purchase under the Government budget. For primary and secondary schooling, the&#13;
regional offices of the SNIES will assume a quality control role, and verify that&#13;
maintenance functions are being carried out. This will have the effect of transforming the&#13;
existing support for school maintenance under the budget (implemented under the PASE )&#13;
into a matching program, under penalty of loss of the modest level of funding currently&#13;
being made available. The project will include all primary and lower secondary schools&#13;
and the seventeen lower secondary VET institutions.&#13;
3.15  Project Support. The project will finance: (a) training of school and community&#13;
personnel in maintenance and upkeep through the intermediary of local NGOs; (b) training&#13;
for SNIES staff and personnel working in the regional offices; (c) incremental operating&#13;
costs for establishing SNIES regional antennae in Lower and Middle Guinea; and (d)&#13;
training of a maintenance person at each of the VET institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
2. Improve Teaching and Student Learning (US$18.7 million)&#13;
3.16 This component supports the Government's objective of improving student&#13;
achievement. In addition to providing textbooks, it will help reform teacher behavior and&#13;
build the capacity of the system to stimulate and respond to school and community-level&#13;
initiatives. Preparatory studies for the project financed under PPF funding and the&#13;
Japanese PHRD grant demonstrated parental dissatisfaction with both learning&#13;
achievements and teacher behavior. The studies revealed differences in teachers'&#13;
interaction patterns and attitudes toward boys and girls; these studies also revealed that&#13;
the teachers were not necessarily aware of their attitudes toward girls and indeed towards&#13;
children in the classroom in general. The studies proposed initiatives to improve&#13;
communication between the school and the community, to change the way school is&#13;
perceived by parents, and to modify teaching methods. In view of these findings, the&#13;
project will finance initiatives to improve the quality of teaching and learning that can be&#13;
expected to reduce the inequities in existing programs. The project will finance the&#13;
following three components: (a) providing textbooks; (b) supporting primary school staff&#13;
development and school improvement through a school-based small grants initiative; and&#13;
(c) improvement of student learning capacity through a school-based micronutrient&#13;
supplement and deworming program.&#13;
3.17 Support for Girls' Schooling. Repetition rates in primary schools in Guinea are&#13;
higher for girls (22.5%) than for boys (13.5%). Dropout rates are much higher, partially&#13;
because inefficiencies of the system are such that girls often reach the age of fifteen or&#13;
sixteen while still at primary school. This leads to parental concerns about pregnancy, or&#13;
increasing pressures for early marriage. Preparatory studies revealed a number of factors&#13;
believed to contribute to lower levels of learning among girls: (a) less access to textbooks;&#13;
(b) differences in teachers' interaction patterns and attitudes towards boys and girls, with&#13;
teachers largely unaware that they are paying significantly less attention to girls and&#13;
expecting less from them; and (c) greater household obligations for girls. Parents were&#13;
also more likely to cite health concerns as a reason for low attendance by girls than as a&#13;
reason for low attendance by boys. Another more subtle factor contributing to differential&#13;
attitudes toward girls may be the systematic bias in favor of boys found by an ACDI-&#13;
financed study of textbooks. The program integrates these concerns by: (a) ensuring&#13;
textbook availability to all students; (b) developing textbooks free of gender bias; (c)&#13;
designing in-service training for teachers that focuses on student/teacher interaction&#13;
patterns; and (d) developing a school-based initiative to improve student health status and&#13;
consequent capacity for learning through a deworming and iodine supplementation&#13;
program.&#13;
(a)   Provide textbooks at both the primary and lower secondary&#13;
levels (US$13.7 million)&#13;
3.18  Scope and Objectives.  The Government plans to improve learning quality&#13;
through the provision of textbooks, with a minimum target of one book each per student&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
for math and French at the primary and lower secondary levels. Yet past experience has&#13;
shown that distribution bottlenecks and poor use of textbooks by teachers can negate the&#13;
impact of books.   Therefore, distribution procedures are being tested prior to&#13;
implementation by the French Ministry of Cooperation, with responsibility for distribution&#13;
being given both to commercial firms and NGOs. The primary schools will be responsible&#13;
for working with parents to ersure that: (a) the books are used regularly by students; and&#13;
(b) the stock is maintained over a six-year period, after which it will be renewed by the&#13;
Government. The books will be made available to schools free of charge and rented to&#13;
students through parents' committees. All children will receive books regardless of ability&#13;
to pay. Similarly, at the secondary level, books will remain the property of schools and&#13;
will be rented to students at subsidized rates. Income from the rental will be used to&#13;
finance maintenance and renewal of the initial stock.&#13;
3.19  USAID will finance the preparation/adaptation of the primary school textbooks as&#13;
part of a process to help the Ministry overhaul its curriculum content, developing a&#13;
problem-solving approach and increasing relevance to real-life situations. USAID will&#13;
also finance construction of storage facilities at the prefectoral education offices&#13;
(Direction pr4fectorale de I'education, DPE) and collaborate with the French Ministry of&#13;
Cooperation to provide in-service training to primary school teachers in the use of the&#13;
books. The AfDB will provide parallel financing for preparation, printing and distribution&#13;
of an additional 11 primary school titles, with similar arrangements at the school level for&#13;
managing and maintaining the stock of books over a six-year period.&#13;
3.20 Sustainability. Textbooks are an essential component of any program to improve&#13;
school quality, without which efforts to upgrade teacher effectiveness cannot succeed.&#13;
The first step toward sustainability is to ensure that the sector develops the capacity to&#13;
distribute books effectively and particularly, to use and maintain textbook stocks&#13;
efficiently for as many years as possible. This component aims to assist Government in&#13;
training school personnel to maintain textbooks over a six-year period, while ensuring&#13;
their effective use. Parents' committees will be responsible for replacing damaged and lost&#13;
books through the proceeds of a textbook rental system. This will greatly reduce the&#13;
recurrent costs associated with replacement of textbooks and bring the overall availability&#13;
of textbooks up to an acceptable threshold level. The component thus establishes a sound&#13;
basis for introducing incremental textbook purchases into the sector budget within five&#13;
years at a sustainable level of cost.&#13;
3.21  Project Support. The project will finance 17 different titles for primary school,&#13;
including the six-year French series, the six-year math series, and the four-year science&#13;
series prepared by the INRAP with USAID support and 20 different titles for lower&#13;
secondary education. Specifically, the project will finance: (a) printing and distribution to&#13;
DPEs of approximately 2.4 million primary school textbooks; (b) purchase and&#13;
distribution of approximately 572,500 lower secondary school textbooks; (c) printing and&#13;
distribution of approximately 44,000 primary school teachers' guides; (d) development,&#13;
printing and distribution of approximately 12,500 lower secondary school teachers' guides;&#13;
(e) training and regional seminars on textbook management and use; and (f) provision of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
foreign short-term technical assistance to help establish the technical and pedagogic&#13;
specifications of the bidding documents and to assist Government in bid evaluation (see&#13;
Annex 6). During appraisal, preliminary discussions were held with the Government and&#13;
the principal donors on the arrangements regarding textbook distribution and financing&#13;
policies; draft operational guidelines for textbook rental and replenishment were submitted&#13;
to IDA prior to negotiations [para. 6.1 (d)]. These will be included in the implementation&#13;
manual.&#13;
(b)   Support primary school staff development and school&#13;
improvement (US$3.2 million)&#13;
3.22  Scope and Objectives. This component will be the operational means for making&#13;
the school the locus of change in the Guinean education system. It will provide an&#13;
innovative approach to staff development by which teachers and school directors will&#13;
assume day-to-day responsibility for instructional leadership, with inspectors and&#13;
pedagogic advisors moving toward a role of pedagogic support, thus reversing the&#13;
unproductive and unsustainable top-down approaches of the past.&#13;
3.23  The "Small Grants Staff Development and School Improvement Program" was&#13;
developed through an intensely participatory process consisting of a series of seminars,&#13;
workshops, focus group interviews and discussions with key stakeholders at all levels of&#13;
the primary education system in Guinea. It is conceived as a five-year process of focusing&#13;
attention on teaching and learning processes and equity, and will be the cornerstone of&#13;
qualitative improvement in Guinean schools. Derived from the Government's statement of&#13;
education sector policy regarding the quality of teaching and learning, it is a key&#13;
transitional program to redefine the role of teacher, principal, pedagogic advisor, and&#13;
inspector.&#13;
3.24  The long-term objectives of the program are to: (a) help teachers focus on&#13;
improving subject matter teaching; (b) introduce promising new approaches to teaching&#13;
into the educational system; (c) explore promising approaches to teaching in resource-&#13;
poor environments; and (d) promote communications about promising approaches to&#13;
teaching among all stakeholders. The medium-term objectives of the program are to&#13;
operationalize the Government's commitment to bringing about school-based change and&#13;
to pass the message of the need for qualitative change in teaching to all stakeholders.&#13;
3.25  Program  Content and Structure.  Under this component, a program  of&#13;
competitive small grants for staff development and school improvement activities will be&#13;
put in place. Teams of teachers and school directors (potentially including representatives&#13;
of communities or parents' commnittees) will prepare proposals for funding. They will be&#13;
given training and technical support for the development of these proposals. In the two-&#13;
step selection process (prefectoral and regional levels), the following criteria will be used:&#13;
(a) the educational value of the proposed project, including (i) the significance of the&#13;
problems addressed by the proposal, (ii) the potential contribution to improving teaching&#13;
and learning at the school(s) in question, (iii) the probability of success in addressing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
identified problems, (iv) the sustainability of the approach beyond the end of the grant&#13;
period, (v) the potential for generalization of the approaches proposed, and (vi) the&#13;
potential benefit for target groups, especially the poor, rural students, and girls; (b) the&#13;
feasibility of the proposed project, including (i) the fit between the activities proposed, the&#13;
time available, and the resources available, and (ii) the capacities, commitment and&#13;
potential of unit members; and (c) community support. The results of the small grants&#13;
program will be discussed at regional and national seminars with emphasis on what could&#13;
be generalized to the system as a whole.&#13;
3.26  Improvement projects will have multiple objectives, including the improvement of&#13;
instructional leadership, personnel management, teaching quality, and girls' access. In&#13;
general, each grant will represent a contract in which the Government provides&#13;
supplementary resources to teachers on condition that the teachers engage in a well-&#13;
defined and verifiable program of activities to increase their knowledge and competence,&#13;
and thereby to improve teaching and learning in the school. The Government has already&#13;
appointed two full-time coordinators (one at the national level and one for the pilot&#13;
region). The program will be modified in light of pilot region experience before being&#13;
extended to the rest of the country (Annex 7). The first annual review will evaluate the&#13;
results of the pilot program.&#13;
3.27 Project Support. The project will finance: (a) small grants averaging GNF&#13;
750,000; (b) foreign short-term technical assistance, most of which will be provided by&#13;
African nationals from countries within the region; (c) training activities; (d) travel&#13;
expenses for trainers and coordinators; (e) motorcycles for regional-level trainers; (f)&#13;
equipment and furniture; (g) annual seminars to disseminate results of the pilot program at&#13;
the national and regional levels; (h) incremental salaries for support services at the regional&#13;
level; and (i) general operating costs. Draft operational guidelines for the management of&#13;
small grants for school-level initiatives were submitted to IDA prior to negotiations [para.&#13;
6.1 (e)]; these guidelines are included in the implementation manual.&#13;
(c)   Increase student learning capacity through a school-based&#13;
micronutrient supplement and deworming program (US$1.8&#13;
million)&#13;
3.28   Scope and Objectives.  Malnutrition and poor health in younger school-age&#13;
children are linked to low rates of enrollment, high rates of absenteeism, early dropout and&#13;
low school attainment. A survey of the Guinean school-age population prior to project&#13;
preparation revealed levels of parasite infection sufficiently high to significantly lower the&#13;
active learning capacity of students. This means that investments in other inputs such as&#13;
teacher training and textbooks will be only partially effective in improving student learning&#13;
outcomes unless accompanied by parallel efforts to increase student health and nutrition.&#13;
In addition, efforts to raise the nutrition and health status of schoolchildren have been&#13;
shown to have potential benefits that are disproportionately greater for girls than boys.&#13;
This is particularly true for iodine supplementation. Since the enrollment of girls lags&#13;
significantly behind that of boys in Guinea, such improvements may help to close the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
gender gap in education. Introducing nutrition and health interventions through schools&#13;
also offers opportunities to correct health and nutrition problems of public health&#13;
significance in the community by establishing a partnership between the school and the&#13;
local health centers and by making teachers more aware of individual student health&#13;
concerns.&#13;
3.29 Unlike in many countries, the Department of School Health in Guinea enjoys&#13;
strong support both from the Ministry of Health and the MEPUFP, and is staffed with&#13;
qualified personnel who have been seconded from the Ministry of Health to the MEPUFP.&#13;
Given this unique structure and history of institutional support, the project will strengthen&#13;
the capacity of this unit to effectively implement school-based nutrition and health&#13;
programs, and support several studies to set the stage for implementing additional&#13;
interventions to improve school nutrition and health in future operations. This program is&#13;
expected to have an immediate impact on student health and will dovetail with the&#13;
development of student health and environment curricula to be funded by USAID.&#13;
3.30 As part of the effort to learn how to improve student learning in Guinea, and to&#13;
continue to increase primary school enrollment, the Government will develop and&#13;
implement, on a broad scale, two high priority interventions-- the mass treatment of&#13;
parasitic infections and iodine supplementation through schools. This program will serve&#13;
as a pilot within the West Africa region and will inform future school health/school&#13;
improvement initiatives. Studies on a limited scale over the first year of implementation&#13;
will guide the expansion of these interventions to cover one million children by the time of&#13;
the mid-term review. Since it is a pilot project, the first of its kind in the region, careful&#13;
attention will be given at the time of the mid-term review to monitoring its impact and&#13;
communicating the results (see Annex 8).&#13;
3.31  Given the process-oriented, developmental nature of this component, the first&#13;
annual review will specifically focus on: (a) timely delivery of adequate supplies of&#13;
antihelminths and iodine supplements; (b) Government's monitoring of pharmaceutical&#13;
stocks; (c) ability of Ministry of Health and MEPUFP to formulate agreed guidelines on&#13;
mutual responsibilities for managing the component; and (d) monitoring procedures to&#13;
provide accurate information about the component's impact on student nutritional status.&#13;
3.32  Project Support. The project will finance: (a) one year of pilot testing and&#13;
baseline data collection; (b) purchase and distribution of antihelminths and iodine&#13;
supplements for an estimated total of 1,000,000 children; (c) studies and ongoing&#13;
operational research and impact evaluation; (d) training and workshops; and (e) a vehicle,&#13;
equipment, and operating costs for the Department of School Health.&#13;
3. Strengthen Education System Management (US$4.7 million)&#13;
3.33  This component will further strengthen the capacity of the MEPUFP to plan and&#13;
manage resources more effectively, and to improve: (a) its monitoring of student learning&#13;
outcomes; (b) its communications with regional and sub-regional units; (c) its school&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
mapping and statistical data processing, critical to a better understanding of girls'&#13;
participation. Support will include computerization of data entry to enable the statistics&#13;
unit to produce and disseminate statistical data during the current school year, in time to&#13;
influence budgetary allocation decisions and school construction decisions for the&#13;
subsequent school year; (d) its budgeting and accounting capacity; and (e) its links with&#13;
the private sector. To this end, the project will: (i) create the capacity for systematically&#13;
monitoring student learning; (ii) develop a viable communications system within the&#13;
sector; (iii) improve sector planning and budgeting; and (iv) support pre-investment&#13;
studies for establishing closer Ministry/private sector links.&#13;
(a)   Create the capacity for systematically monitoring student&#13;
learning (US$1.2 million)&#13;
3.34   Scope and Objectives. The Government has not yet established specific goals for&#13;
improving teaching and student learning. This is due, in part, to the almost complete lack&#13;
of reliable indicators.  An initiative to be undertaken with USAID  support, the&#13;
Fundamental Quality Levels (Niveauxfondamentaux de qualite), will establish indicators&#13;
of input quality (textbooks and materials, etc.) while the present component will establish&#13;
indicators of actual teaching and learning quality. The French Ministry of Cooperation&#13;
will support a complementary initiative to measure external efficiency, i.e. the impact of&#13;
schooling on subsequent employment. This will serve as a follow-up to a broad-based&#13;
evaluation of primary schooling in Guinea carried out as a part of the preparation for this&#13;
program. The generally negative results of this evaluation point to the need for more&#13;
information about what students are learning in school and how well they are learning it.&#13;
3.35   This sub-component will establish the capacity to periodically sample student&#13;
learning by developing reliable indicators of student learning in Reading and Mathematics&#13;
for all levels of primary schooling. Indicative tests will be prepared by MEPUFP with the&#13;
help of an international research center. The tests will be based on the local curriculum&#13;
and administered to randomly selected Grade 2, 4, and 6 classes throughout the country.&#13;
An evaluation center will be established to conduct tests every second year, thus providing&#13;
a clear indication of student learning outcomes and showing both the impact of project&#13;
activities and the evolution of the system as a whole. A sampling methodology will be&#13;
developed within the first year to help Government establish a permanent curriculum-&#13;
based testing capacity. Institutional and structural arrangements for the testing unit will be&#13;
determined during the pilot testing period. The French Ministry of Cooperation will&#13;
provide support for developing the capacity of the unit to evaluate the external efficiency&#13;
of schooling.&#13;
3.36  Project Support. The project will finance: (a) development and printing of six&#13;
curriculum-based tests of student learning, and establishment of a test item bank; (b) pilot&#13;
applications of each test on a limited scale; (c) two testing cycles for each of the six tests;&#13;
(d) short-term training of personnel responsible for testing and evaluation; (e) a total of 20&#13;
weeks of foreign technical assistance; (f) refurbishing of a building, with equipment and&#13;
furniture, for the evaluation unit; and (g) publication and distribution of test results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
(b)   Develop a viable communications system within the sector&#13;
(US$0.9 million)&#13;
3.37  Scope and Objectives. Without a dramatic improvement in communications&#13;
within the education sector, it will be difficult to ensure the close coordination needed for&#13;
project success. During the course of project preparation, a comprehensive study of&#13;
communication patterns revealed enormous amounts of lost time and opportunity as a&#13;
result of communication difficulties. Since sufficient improvements in the quality, cost and&#13;
coverage of the telephone system are unlikely to occur in the short term, it is proposed&#13;
that improved communications be developed by means of two related initiatives that can&#13;
function independently of the telephone system, although telephone system improvement,&#13;
where feasible, will also be sought: (a) radiocommunication among all subprefectoral and&#13;
prefectoral education offices, regional education offices, and the central Ministry offices in&#13;
Conakry; and (b) installation of electronic communication capacity for those offices which&#13;
have computer capacity and for the five regional education offices. In Conakry, the&#13;
system can function by means of radio modems, bypassing the need for functioning&#13;
telephones. Training will be provided in the use and maintenance of radiocommunications&#13;
systems and daily interprefectoral and intraprefectoral schedules for communications will&#13;
be established.  With regards to electronic communications, a feasibility study for&#13;
establishing an Internet connections was conducted as a part of project preparation, along&#13;
with an overall report on the Ministry's communication needs. An initial link was installed&#13;
under the PPF and successfully provides communications between the country and&#13;
external sources, including IDA. The internal links will be greatly extended under the&#13;
project, in line with recommendations of the preparatory studies which highlight the need&#13;
for careful attention to building efficient communications processes. This would support a&#13;
rapid two-way flow of communication and generate a much higher degree of horizontal&#13;
communication than currently exists.&#13;
3.38  Project Support. The project will finance: (a) radio communications for&#13;
subprefectoral, prefectoral and regional offices; (b) training in the use of new&#13;
communications systems; and (c) establishment of Internet links for central and regional&#13;
offices.&#13;
(c)   Improve sector planning, budgeting and monitoring (US$1.6 million)&#13;
3.39 Scope and Objectives. Under the PASE, a budget unit was established within the&#13;
Finance Directorate (DAAF) of the MEPUFP with responsibility for ensuring the flow of&#13;
budgeted funds to the interior of the country. There is now a need for a corresponding&#13;
internal audit capacity within the Ministry.  Auditing teams will be created with&#13;
responsibility for overseeing accounting procedures and disposition of funds at the&#13;
prefectoral level (SAAF). This will be complemented by USAID and French support for&#13;
central DAAF functioning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
3.40  In addition to these activities, since improvements in the capacity for decentralized&#13;
financial management will depend in large part on the availability of accurate, current&#13;
information about the school system, IDA funding will help the SSP develop the role of&#13;
information clearinghouse for the sector. The focus will be on ensuring that statistical&#13;
information gathered through the school mapping and statistical data collection exercises&#13;
is available and disseminated in such a way as to inform the Ministry's decision-making&#13;
processes. IDA will finance equipment and training for the school mapping unit to&#13;
decentralize the analysis of data and to more fully implicate prefectoral and regional&#13;
planners in school siting decisions. It will also help develop the capacity to update&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation needs on an annual basis. USAID will provide funding for&#13;
technical assistance to the school statistics unit.&#13;
3.41  Project Support. The project will finance: (a) equipment and furniture for the&#13;
eight regional education offices; (b) short-term technical assistance for the development of&#13;
methodology guides; (c) training and initial establishment of teams to audit the SAAFs; (d)&#13;
training of key personnel and equipment in the school mapping unit; (e) annual audits of&#13;
the project and semi-annual audits of the special account; (f) study visits; (g) a beneficiary&#13;
assessment to be carried out before the mid-term review; and (h) incremental operating&#13;
costs.&#13;
(d)   Support pre-investment studies for establishing closer Ministry/&#13;
private sector links (US$1.0 million)&#13;
3.42 Scope and Objectives. Management weakness in two subsectors of the Guinean&#13;
educational system, i.e. private schooling and vocational training, has been such that&#13;
activities in these areas have often been at cross-purposes with stated Government&#13;
objectives. The private school support unit in MEPUFP, rather than encouraging greater&#13;
private sector involvement in and support for schooling, has frequently erected barriers to&#13;
the opening of private schools through costly administrative procedures, onerous&#13;
reporting requirements, and lengthy approval processes. As a result, the private education&#13;
sector in Guinea is among the least developed in the region, accounting for only 4.3% of&#13;
primary students, 2.3% of secondary students and 22% of VET students. Similarly, the&#13;
VET directorate has failed to establish links with the labor market and has maintained&#13;
expensive programs from which graduates have consistently failed to find employment.&#13;
Preparatory studies also demonstrated that the relevance and quality of VET are critical to&#13;
girls' participation: in the absence of significant employment prospects, parents show an&#13;
even stronger reluctance to send their girls to these programs.&#13;
3.43  Government, in its statement of sectoral policy, recognizes these shortcomings.&#13;
During the course of project preparation, a series of participative policy development&#13;
workshops were held, bringing together, often for the first time, private sector&#13;
representatives and Ministry personnel. This component will finance the ongoing process&#13;
of policy dialogue with a view to identifying reform initiatives worthy of investment&#13;
support (by Government or donors) in the future. In the VET subsector, support wili also&#13;
be given to the functioning of a broad-based commission evaluating the relevance of VET&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
programs on an institution by institution basis and introducing demand-driven changes as&#13;
well as ensuring the involvement of private sector companies. This process was begun&#13;
under PPF funding.&#13;
3.44  Project Support. The project will finance: (a) pre-investment studies of private&#13;
sector primary schooling; (b) policy-dialogue workshops for private school operators and&#13;
Ministry personnel; (c) pre-investment studies of VET programs; (d) training; and (e)&#13;
operating costs for the commission on VET school relevance.&#13;
C. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.45  Total program cost is estimated at US$141.3 million equivalent, with a foreign&#13;
exchange component of US$83.3 million equivalent. The IDA credit of US$ 42.5 million&#13;
will finance 30% of the total program cost, including 28% of the foreign exchange cost&#13;
(US$23.6 rnillion equivalent) and 43% of the local cost (US$18.9 million equivalent).&#13;
Guinea (Government and communities) will finance 18% of the program cost, including&#13;
21% of local cost (US$9.5 million equivalent), plus taxes and duties (US$13.7 million&#13;
equivalent). A five-year budget framework has been designed by the Government,&#13;
together with IDA, USAID and France. The Government has agreed on an average&#13;
increase for the operating budget of MEPUFP of GNF 2.0 billion per year during the&#13;
project duration. This represents an average increase of 3.5% per year. The MEPUFP&#13;
(which does not include higher education) will represent an average 17.5% of the national&#13;
operating budget. Primary education's share of the total education budget will increase&#13;
from 35% to 42% by the year 2000. The current teacher:student ratios will be maintained,&#13;
both in urban and in rural areas. Prior to negotiations, the Government submitted budget&#13;
projections [para. 6.1 (b)] and a draft investment program [para. 6.1 (f)] for 1995-2000&#13;
consistent with the policy and program priorities of the sector. During negotiations,&#13;
agreements were reached between IDA and the Government on budget projections for the&#13;
MEPUFP and the school construction and rehabilitation program for the period 1995-&#13;
2000 [para. 6.2 (a)]. The joint annual reviews of the project will assess the progress made&#13;
against monitorable indicators for teacher hiring outlined in Annex 5. The six cofinanciers&#13;
[AfD)B, Canada, European Union (Lom6 IV), France, Japan, and USAID] will finance&#13;
52% of the total program cost, including 68% of the foreign exchange cost (US$56.8&#13;
million equivalent) and 36% of local cost (US$15.9 million equivalent). Base costs of the&#13;
project are estimated at US$45.6 million and contingencies at US$7.4 million. Physical&#13;
contingencies of 10% have been included for works and goods. Price contingencies for&#13;
foreign exchange costs and local currency have been estimated at 2.2% and 4.0%,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
3.46  Recurrent Cost Implications. The first important recurrent cost implication of&#13;
the program investments is the incremental salaries for additional primary school teachers.&#13;
To ease the budget impact of hiring the primary school teachers needed to reach the&#13;
Government enrollment target, the FED will finance 1,000 teacher candidates per year for&#13;
on-the-job training, or a total of 5,000 over five years. The Government will allocate&#13;
sufficient funds in its budgets for 1997, 1998 and 1999, for the creation of at least 600&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
primary school teacher positions annually over the three-year period. Prior to the start of&#13;
the 1997-98, 1998-99, and 1999-2000 school years, the Government will recruit not less&#13;
than 600 additional primary school teachers. At current rates for salaries and benefits of&#13;
beginning teachers, this will cost 132,500 Guinean francs (GNF) per teacher per month.&#13;
The total incremental cost of GNF 5.7 billion (US$5.8 million equivalent) will represent,&#13;
with pedagogical material and taxes and duties, the Government's counterpart funding in&#13;
the program, beginning in the second year of the project. The capacity of the national&#13;
budget and measures to absorb this increase and the Government commitment to reassign&#13;
civil service positions in favor of the education sector were assessed favorably at appraisal.&#13;
The recruitment of 600 additional primary school teachers for the 1995-96 school year is a&#13;
condition of credit effectiveness [para. 6.3 (a)]. The second important recurrent cost&#13;
implication is the maintenance of the initial stock of textbooks at the primary level and the&#13;
textbook rental program at the secondary level (US$2.8 million equivalent over the life of&#13;
the project). This cost will be limited through the building of a stock maintenance&#13;
capacity at the school level for primary education and at the APE level for lower&#13;
secondary schooling.  The third important recurrent cost implication of program&#13;
investments is the cost of school maintenance during the project duration (US$0.5 million&#13;
equivalent). This cost will be kept at this low level by strengthening the communities'&#13;
capacity for school building maintenance and upkeep.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
4.1   Project preparation benefitted from: (a) an intensive dialogue, during PASE&#13;
implementation, among various government departments and the principal donors to the&#13;
sector, leading to an updated framework for education development (the Government's&#13;
Statement of Education Sector Policy); and (b) Bank/Government workshops supporting&#13;
policy development, strategic and financial planning, and investment programming. These&#13;
client consultation activities were financed by a grant from Japan under the PHRD Fund&#13;
(V61.5 million).  Additional support was provided by two PPF advances totaling&#13;
US$329,000.&#13;
4.2   A draft implementation manual was submitted prior to negotiations [para. 6.1 (g)].&#13;
During negotiations, agreements were reached between IDA and the Government on: (a)&#13;
the draft implementation manual [para. 6.2 (b)]; and (b) draft terms of reference for all&#13;
technical assistance (all short term) funded under the project [para. 6.2 (c)]. The adoption&#13;
of the implementation manual [para. 6.3 (b)] and the signature of contracts for all&#13;
consultant services required for the first year of the project [para. 6.3 (e)] are conditions&#13;
of credit effectiveness.&#13;
B. SUPERVISION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.3   The monitoring and evaluation of program performance, including investments and&#13;
policy reforms, will be carried out by the implementing units of MEPUFP over the project&#13;
life with the Steering Committee (Comite de pilotage du PASE, CP-PASE) playing a&#13;
coordinating role. IDA's supervision plan (Annex 10) and MEPUFPs monitoring system&#13;
(paras. 4.4-4.7) will be observed closely to ensure the most efficient use of resources and&#13;
the timely execution of project activities. Adequate supervision resources have been&#13;
programmed for each of the eight regional education offices as well as key central&#13;
Ministry personnel to ensure their active and continuous participation in supervising&#13;
project activities. Key monitorable indicators based on the Government's program (para.&#13;
3.1) are shown in Annex 5.&#13;
4.4   Government's  Monitoring  System.  The  organization  of the  PASE&#13;
implementation has been quite efficient and will be continued under this project. The&#13;
coordination and management of the project will be carried out by the operational units of&#13;
the MEPUFP as part of their functions. The Steering Committee, in its capacity as the&#13;
principal decision-making body of the MEPUFP, will be responsible for the overall&#13;
coordination and evaluation of this project.  It will also be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of activities related to sector planning and education improvements. The&#13;
Technical Secretariat for the PASE (Secretariat technique, Si), headed by the project&#13;
coordinator, is now part of the MEPUFP structure. It will coordinate the day-to-day&#13;
activities of the project and monitor project implementation and outcomes. The ST will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
collaborate with the DAAF in preparing annual work programs and budgets and will have&#13;
the ultimate responsibility of compiling and providing reports and documentation to the&#13;
Bank as required by the project. The ST will serve as liaison between the MEPUFP and&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
4.5   In its project coordination role, the ST will organize joint annual reviews on the&#13;
status of project implementation and a mid-term review as well as IDA supervision&#13;
missions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached between IDA  and the&#13;
Government regarding ST's responsibility for ensuring that: (a) progress reports on the&#13;
implementation of the projet are transmitted to IDA not later than January 31 and July 31&#13;
of each year; (b) annual projected work programs and budgets are submitted not later than&#13;
November 30 of each year; (c) during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, a review of&#13;
progress made in carrying out planned activities for the current year is organized and&#13;
carried out with IDA [para. 6.2 (d)]; and (d) a mid-term review to evaluate the progress&#13;
made in implementing the project and the program is carried out with IDA and the other&#13;
principal donors not later than 30 months after credit effectiveness [para. 6.2 (e)].&#13;
4.6   The DAAF will be responsible for all of the project's financial matters and will&#13;
coordinate with the ST in the preparation of annual work programs and budgets for all&#13;
project components.  A project accountant within the DAAF will maintain project&#13;
accounts and prepare disbursement requests. A contract manager within the DAAF will&#13;
handle all procurement activities. Finally, the DAAF will assist the ST in preparing&#13;
progress reports and the documentation required for the joint annual reviews of project&#13;
implementation as specified in Annex 10.&#13;
4.7   The Department of Primary Education (Direction nationale de l'enseignement&#13;
elmentaire, DNEE) will be responsible for ensuring that the set of actions identified for&#13;
the Small Grants Staff Development and School Improvement Program and *the&#13;
improvement of student learning capacity is implemented. The DNEE, the Directorate of&#13;
General Secondary Education (Direction nationale de /'enseignement secondaire, DNES)&#13;
and the INRAP will collaborate in designing and evaluating the in-service training&#13;
component. Under the leadership of the ST, which will ensure coordination with DNEE&#13;
and DNES, INRAP will be responsible for preparing the pedagogical and technical&#13;
specifications for textbooks to be purchased; they will also participate in the evaluation of&#13;
bid proposals. Textbook procurement will be carried out by the procurement unit of the&#13;
DAAF (Annex 6). The SNIES will be responsible for developing construction and&#13;
rehabilitation norms and overseeing the overall construction and rehabilitation program.&#13;
Responsibility for monitoring student learning outcomes will be that of the evaluation unit;&#13;
this process will also help monitor project outcomes (see para. 3.35).  The VET&#13;
Directorate and the Private Education Unit (Service de 1'enseignement prive) will be&#13;
responsible for the implementation of the studies on Ministry/private sector collaboration;&#13;
the School Health unit will implement the school health and nutrition component, serving&#13;
as liaison for this purpose between the Ministry of Health and MEPUFP. The DPEs win&#13;
implement and monitor project activities at the prefectoral level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
4.8   Mid-Term Review. The Government and IDA will, not later than 30 months&#13;
after credit effectiveness, conduct a mid-term project implementation review to evaluate&#13;
the progress made in carrying out the project and meeting its objectives. During&#13;
negotiations, agreements were reached between IDA and the Government that the mid-&#13;
term review will include an evaluation of: (a) MEPUFP progress in implementing policy&#13;
measures; (b) the impact of policy measures on staffing, cost and efficiency within the&#13;
sector, and the increase in girls' participation; (c) the progress with recruitment of&#13;
teaching staff, (d) the implementation of the Small Grants Staff Development and School&#13;
Improvement Program; (e) the progress of the school construction and rehabilitation&#13;
program; (f) the progress in identifying reform initiatives in support of private schooling at&#13;
the primary level; (g) the progress in the evaluation of future VET programs; (h) the&#13;
progress in implementing the pilot school health and nutrition program; and (i) the findings&#13;
of the beneficiary assessment [para. 6.2 (e)]. The mid-term review will be organized by&#13;
the ST. It will be conducted with other donors affiliated with the project and will also&#13;
review progress in the implementation of their programs.&#13;
4.9   Implementation Completion Report. Sufficiently ahead of the scheduled final&#13;
supervision/completion mission, the Government will prepare an independent evaluation of&#13;
project implementation and outcomes. During the completion mission, IDA will ensure&#13;
that IDA/Govemment views are well understood by both parties, before being recorded in&#13;
an agreed aide-memoire.   Within six months after the credit closing date, an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report will be finalized by IDA.&#13;
C. IMLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
4.10  The project will be implemented over a five-year period (1995-2000). This time&#13;
period has been selected based on lessons learned from the two education investment&#13;
projects, the PASE, and over the course of preparation of this project. The five-year&#13;
period was also selected based on the expected outcomes of project activities to build&#13;
MEPUFP capacity, notably staff training and professional development. Annex 11&#13;
provides the framework for implementing project activities and the basis for planning the&#13;
physical aspects of project implementation. The disbursement schedule for the project is&#13;
provided in Annex 12.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.11  Table 1 on the following page summarizes the project elements as well as their&#13;
estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement.  Procurement management&#13;
arrangements and procedures are explained in paras. 4.12-4.15.  All Bank-financed&#13;
procurement within the project of goods, works, and consulting services will be in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines. ICB procurement will use the Bank's relevant standard&#13;
bidding documents. Selection of consulting firms for complex, time-based assignments&#13;
will be done on the basis of the Bank's standard letter of invitation and form of contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4.12  Procurement Procedures. Under the project, procurement procedures will be&#13;
undertaken as described in the following paragraph. Aggregate amounts are including&#13;
taxes and duties. IDA standard bidding documents will be used.&#13;
Works:&#13;
The civil works program, totaling US$19.2 million equivalent, covers: (a) the&#13;
rehabilitation or construction of 1800 classrooms; and (b) the emergency rehabilitation of&#13;
classrooms to be managed by NGOs hired under procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
ICB: Imported construction material contracts (for an aggregate amount of US$11.6&#13;
million equivalent) for the works in (a) above, estimated to cost US$250,000 each or&#13;
more, will be procured by NGOs following ICB procedures.&#13;
Other: Contracts for small works estimated at US$10,000 equivalent or less, totaling not&#13;
more than US$7.6 million equivalent will include procurement of local materials to be&#13;
managed and awarded by NGOs according to local shopping procedures in accordance&#13;
with section III of the IDA Procurement Guidelines. Beneficiary communities will initially&#13;
provide preliminary/complementary works like site preparation, construction of wells, etc.&#13;
Along with needs indicated by the school mapping unit, expressed interest in, mobilization&#13;
for, and significant progress of such participation will be major criteria for the selection of&#13;
the schools to be rehabilitated and/or constructed.&#13;
Goods:&#13;
ICB: Contracts for goods estimated at US$250,000 equivalent or more will be procured&#13;
through ICB. Goods procured through ICB will be exempt from price verification under&#13;
preshipment inspection by a third party inspection procedure. Vehicles, office and other&#13;
imported equipment for an aggregate amount of US$1.9 million equivalent will be&#13;
procured through ICB procedures as described above for construction materials, with&#13;
about 3-5 contracts. Eligible domestic manufacturers will receive a price preference in bid&#13;
evaluation of 15% (or the amount of customs duties, whichever is lowest).&#13;
LCB: Locally procured furniture, materials and supplies (US$5.0 million equivalent) will&#13;
be procured through about 30 smaller contracts in which foreign firms will not be&#13;
interested. Such contracts, not exceeding US$150,000 equivalent each, will be procured&#13;
using LCB procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Other: Small training materials and supplies will be procured through local shopping&#13;
procedures, for an aggregate amount of US$20,000 equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
Textbooks:&#13;
ICB: The printing or procurement of initial stocks of textbooks and teachers' guides for&#13;
primary and lower secondary schools (US$12.7 million equivalent) will be through ICB&#13;
procedures. It is expected that each contract will exceed US$250,000 equivalent.&#13;
LCB: Services for distributing the initial stocks of textbooks directly to the schools&#13;
(US$0.7 million equivalent) will be procured through LCB procedures, acceptable to IDA&#13;
(see Annex 6). It is expected that each of the 7 contracts will be less than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent each.&#13;
Pharmaceuticals: Micronutrients and antihelminths for an aggregate amount of US$0.7&#13;
million equivalent will be purchased under ICB procurement procedures. Contracts for&#13;
drugs expected to cost less than US$30,000 each up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$100,000 will be procured by international or local shopping procedures.&#13;
Small Grants: The small grants (US$1 million equivalent) will finance school-level&#13;
initiatives to improve the quality of primary education and girls' schooling.  Small&#13;
contracts (less than US$2,000 equivalent each) comprised of various miscellaneous items&#13;
required for schools and related services will be awarded by local shopping and off-the-&#13;
shelf procedures. Applications will be evaluated for technical content and eligible criteria&#13;
outlined in the implementation manual.&#13;
Procurement and Services: Management, architectural, procurement, auditing and&#13;
various sectoral and technical services (including training abroad), for an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$5.5 million equivalent, wiil be procured in accordance with principles and&#13;
procedures satisfactory to IDA on the basis of the 'Guidelines for the Use of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published by the&#13;
Bank in August 1981. Technical assistance and training programs and calendars are&#13;
outlined in Annex 11.&#13;
Miscellaneous: Consumables, incremental staff salaries, supervision and local training&#13;
allowances, etc. will be acquired and paid for following regular Government procedures&#13;
which have been found acceptable to IDA and are defined in the implementation manual.&#13;
4.13  Procurement Management: The services of the DAAF will be responsible for all&#13;
procurement with the exception of that related to primary school civil works. Two&#13;
procurement specialists will receive training in IDA procedures. Short-term technical&#13;
assistance will also be provided to strengthen the DAAFs capacity to develop equipment&#13;
specifications and other bidding documents. The project auditor will be invited to assess&#13;
their performance prior to credit effectiveness. The DAAF will report bid evaluations and&#13;
contract award publication. It will also review procurement progress in semi-annual&#13;
reports to IDA. NGOs will be contracted to manage the primary school construction and&#13;
rehabilitation program under the supervision of the SNIES. Standard bidding documents&#13;
for LCB procurement of goods and services were submitted to IDA prior to negotiations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
[para. 6.1 (h)] and agreed upon during negotiations [para. 6.2 (f)]. Table 2 details the&#13;
standard time frame for each procurement method.&#13;

4.14   Local Procedures:  A Country Procurement Assessment has not yet been&#13;
completed. However, the Borrower's procurement regulations and procedures have been&#13;
reviewed by IDA and the Government, and proposals for improvement are currently being&#13;
discussed. Pending an agreement, IDA standard bidding documents will continue to be&#13;
systematically used, as is being done satisfactorily under current projects.&#13;
4.15   Procurement Schedule: The schedule of major procurement activities is provided&#13;
in the annexed Implementation and Disbursement Schedules (Annexes 11 and 12). The&#13;
following are conditions for credit effectiveness (para. 6.3):&#13;
(a) Submitted bidding documents acceptable to IDA for all major packages to be&#13;
procured through ICB during the first year of the project;&#13;
(b) Signed contracts with NGOs for the management of civil works related to the&#13;
primary school construction and rehabilitation program; and&#13;
(c) Signed contracts for all consultant services required for the first year of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.16 Review by IDA: During project execution, IDA-financed contracts for works and&#13;
goods above a threshold of US$150,000 will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures.&#13;
The review process will cover 80% of the total value procured by ICB and LCB (about&#13;
95% ICB; about 30% LCB). Selective post review of awarded contracts below the&#13;
threshold level will be carried out for one in five contracts for civil works and for one in&#13;
seven contracts for goods. Post review of contracts for works (excluding building&#13;
materials) awarded through NGOs will be carried out by external auditors as a random&#13;
review of approximately 20% of the contracts. All consultant contracts will be subject to&#13;
IDA's prior review procedures. However, prior review or approval of budgets, short lists,&#13;
selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts will&#13;
not be required for contracts below a threshold of US$100,000 equivalent for consultant&#13;
finns, and US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultants, for which post-review&#13;
procedures will apply. Nevertheless, prior review will continue to be required for all terms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
of reference, the employment of individuals, single source selection of firms, or&#13;
assignments determined by IDA to be of a critical nature or to amendments of contracts&#13;
raising the contract value to or more than US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
respectively for consultant firms and individual consultants.&#13;
4.17 Procurement Information. During negotiations, IDA and the Government&#13;
reached agreement on procurement reporting tasks [para. 6.2 (g)]:&#13;
(a)   Prompt reporting of contract award information including packaging,&#13;
advertising, procurement method, estimated costs, and for every approved&#13;
contract the duly completed forms required by IDA;&#13;
(b)   Submission of comprehensive semi-annual reports by March 31 and&#13;
September 30 of each year indipating:&#13;
(i)   revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising,&#13;
bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual&#13;
contracts;&#13;
(ii)  revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project,&#13;
including best estimates of allowances for physical and price&#13;
contingencies; and&#13;
(iii)  compliance with aggregate limits on  specified methods of&#13;
procurement;&#13;
(c)   Preparation of an Implementation Completion Report within six months&#13;
after the credit closing date (Annex 10).&#13;
E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.18  The project is expected to be completed over a five-year period, with the IDA&#13;
credit disbursed over six years, according to the categories shown in Table 2. The&#13;
estimated disbursement profile is shown in Annex 12. Disbursement of the credit will be&#13;
fully documented except for expenditures valued at less than US$150,000 equivalent&#13;
which will be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation for&#13;
withdrawals under SOEs will be retained at the DAAF for review by IDA supervision&#13;
missions and for project auditors. To facilitate disbursement, the Government will open a&#13;
Special Deposit Account (SDA) in a commercial bank to cover IDA's share of eligible&#13;
expenditures managed by the MEPUFP. The authorized allocation for the SDA will be&#13;
US$1.5 million with an initial deposit of the GNF equivalent of US$750,000. IDA will&#13;
make an initial deposit of that amount from the proposed Credit upon credit effectiveness&#13;
and will replenish the SDA upon receipt of satisfactory proof of incurred eligible&#13;
expenditures. Replenishment requests will be accompanied by up-to-date bank statements&#13;
and reconciliations of the SDA. Applications for direct payments and reimbursement or&#13;
requests for special commitments will apply to contracts above US$150,000 equivalent.&#13;

F. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
4.19 The accounting system in DAAF was created during PASE and is working&#13;
satisfactorily. The DAAF will be responsible for the financial management of the project&#13;
and will maintain consolidated project accounts. Project accounts, including the SDA, will&#13;
be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; all disbursements under&#13;
SOEs as well as the SDA will be audited semi-annually. During negotiations, IDA&#13;
reached agreement with the Government that it will submit to IDA annual audit reports, of&#13;
reasonable scope and detail, within six months of the end of the fiscal year and, in the case&#13;
of the SOEs, that it will submit semi-annual reports within three months after the end of&#13;
each audit period [para. 6.2 (h)]. The appointment of an independent auditor under a&#13;
multi-year contract acceptable to IDA is a condition of credit effectiveness [para. 6.3 (f)].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. PROJIECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   Project Benefits. There are two main benefits. The first benefit will be the&#13;
provision of more and better education, which in the long term will contribute to poverty&#13;
reduction. The primary school gross enrollment rate will rise from 40% to 53% during the&#13;
project period. Rural students' participation will increase from 20% to 40%, and the&#13;
gross primary school enrollment rate of girls, currently at 29%, will reach 42% at the&#13;
primary level. The quality of education will be improved by providing an initial stock of&#13;
textbooks at the primary and lower secondary levels, promoting school-level initiatives,&#13;
and increasing student learning capacity by improving the health and nutrition of school&#13;
children. Support for school-level initiatives will develop innovative teaching practices&#13;
and provide for continuing stakeholder participation in improving the quality of learning&#13;
and teaching. The second benefit will be the further development of capacity within the&#13;
Ministry of Pre-University Education and Vocational Training to plan, monitor, and&#13;
manage the sector and sector outputs in a sustainable manner.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5.2   Project Risks. There are two main risks. The first risk is failure to attain project&#13;
goals if the budget allocations for the sector, analyzed thoroughly to ensure their&#13;
coherence with the recurrent cost implications of the project, are not executed. This risk&#13;
will be addressed by agreements reached with Government regarding budget allocations.&#13;
Primary education's share of the total education budget will increase from 35% to 42% by&#13;
the year 2000. The Government will allocate sufficient funds in its budget for 1997, 1998&#13;
and 1999 for the creation of 600 additional primary school teacher positions for each of&#13;
these years. Prior to the start of the 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 school years, the&#13;
Government will recruit 600 additional primary school teachers. The Public Expenditure&#13;
Review currently being implemented will also strengthen the Government's capacity to&#13;
assess the priority of education in the budget allocations. Budget targets have been&#13;
developed by Government with the full participation of all major donors. Budget&#13;
execution will be monitored on a semi-annual basis, subject to joint annual reviews by the&#13;
donors and Government.  A second risk is the current weakness of decentralized&#13;
education units in the management of budget resources. This risk is addressed by ongoing&#13;
efforts to strengthen the prefectoral education offices (DPEs) together with the DAAF,&#13;
and the use of short-term technical assistance to transfer skills to staff. The Small Grants&#13;
Staff Development and School Improvement Program provides an additional mechanism&#13;

EQUITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
STATEMENT OF EDUCATION SECTOR POLICY&#13;
Reference documents:&#13;
-     Statement of education sector policy adopted by the Government on September 19,&#13;
1989;&#13;
-     Previous letter of education development policy dated October 21, 1989;&#13;
-     Joint aide-memoire dated May 11, 1993 reporting on the second joint donor review of&#13;
PASE I&#13;
-     Findings of surveys and studies done on the education system in Guinea in the context&#13;
of preparing for PASE II.&#13;
These documents define the framework within which the Programme dAjustement&#13;
Sectoriel de lEducation I - PASE I (Education Sector Adjustment Program) was implemented&#13;
from October 1990 to June 1994 and record the efforts made during this period and the&#13;
recommendations proposed for continuing the development and improvement efforts during&#13;
the next phase from 1995 to 2000.&#13;
The accomplishments of PASE I:&#13;
Started by the Government in October 1990, with the joint participation of three&#13;
donors: the World Bank, the French Ministry of Cooperation and USAID, the Education&#13;
Sector Adjustment Program was concluded successfully in June 1994. It entailed the&#13;
participation of all the actors in the education sector, the rehabilitation of sector management&#13;
and the transparency of activities The main results included the following:&#13;
(a)   The Budget management was reformed, as a result of the reorganization that took&#13;
place (creation of a budget unit and a counterpart funds management unit) and the level of&#13;
performance achieved in terms of the computerization and budgeting of the action plans. After&#13;
increasing from 14% in 1990 to 26% in 1991, the proportion of the national operating budget&#13;
allocated to education stabilized in 1992 at 25.2%, with 35% of this going to elementary&#13;
education; this distribution was maintained in 1993.&#13;
(b)   The human resource development plan introduced in 1991 led to the publication of a&#13;
special statute for pre-university teaching personnel and the redeployment of 1,806 teachers to&#13;
the primary grades. In parallel, 8,000 primary school teachers received refresher courses in&#13;
French  and mathematics; 64 teacher training  school teachers and  111  teaching&#13;
advisors/mentors were trained at the Institut Superieur des Sciences de l'Education.&#13;
(c)    1,500 classrooms were built during the PASE period, with the assistance of the&#13;
international community and as many again were built with national funds, the national budget&#13;
and voluntary individual contributions, i.e. about 3,000 classrooms in all. In addition, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page2 of 6&#13;
prograrn for the rehabilitation of school and administrative buildings now covers all regions of&#13;
the country, under the supervision of regional branches of the School Construction Service.&#13;
(d)   A vast program to provide school furniture, textbooks and supplies is gradually&#13;
improving working conditions in the classrooms, significantly impacting local economic life and&#13;
making a start on gradually getting the families to assume certain operating costs.&#13;
(e)    Thanks to the national campaign to gather statistical data on schools (students,&#13;
personnel and infrastructure) conducted in 1991, it has been possible to establish reliable annual&#13;
statistics and an operational school mapping system.&#13;
(f)    All these measures have had a spectacular effect on the gross school enrollment rate,&#13;
which rose from 28% in 1990/91 to 40% in 1993/1994; the enrollment rate in the first year of&#13;
primary education rose from 38.92% in 1991 to 50.72% in 1994.&#13;
(g)   The priority the Government has given to elementary education has not interfered with&#13;
efforts to assist the other education subsectors: teacher trainers have been trained for secondary&#13;
education, in conjunction with plans to set up scientific laboratories and pedagogical&#13;
documentation centers. Following exhaustive studies, a Statement of National Policy on&#13;
Technical Education and Vocational Training was also adopted in March 1994 with a view to&#13;
improving the linkage between the programs of this subsector and the job market.&#13;
(h)   Nonformal education has also benefited from the momentum generated by the PASE&#13;
as regards the gradual implementation of the "Basic Education for All" National Action Plan:&#13;
the creation of a Centre Experimental dEducation Technologique et Artisanale - CETA&#13;
(Experimental Technological and Artisanal Education Center) to help young people enter the&#13;
job market; the experimentation with two "NAFA" centers, second chance schools for young&#13;
people not in school, or who have dropped out, in the 10-17 age bracket; surveys and&#13;
awareness-raising campaigns to encourage school enrollment among girls. The literacy rate&#13;
has risen from 26% to 28%, with particular efforts to extend initial literacy training with special&#13;
or vocational training courses.&#13;
Plans and priorities of PASE II:&#13;
(a)   In reaffirming the priority given to the education sector as a means of furthering socio-&#13;
economic development, the Government will maintain rigor and transparency in the&#13;
management of the education budget in order to make more efficient use of the resources&#13;
available, improve the quality of teaching and increase the enrollment and literacy training rate&#13;
as part of the plan for Education for All.&#13;
(b)   The increased resources now made available to the sector should guarantee. the&#13;
implementation of minimum  standards as regards investment in capital equipment and&#13;
operating expenditures designed to promote the three levels of pre-university education, with&#13;
priority being given to the elementary level. Measures to compensate for the transitory costs of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the program will be adopted to benefit the underprivileged groups: girls, young people in the&#13;
rural areas who have dropped out of school or are not enrolled, and illiterate adults, especially&#13;
in the rural areas.&#13;
(c)    The expansion of the multigrade class program in rural areas, the continuation of&#13;
experiments in environmental education, population education and training in technological and&#13;
practical skills will help to tailor education to social and economic development, making it part&#13;
of a process to reform Guinean schools.&#13;
(d)   In order to continue efforts to restructure the administration of the sector and to&#13;
strengthen its management, inspection and extension capabilities, training activities for all&#13;
categories of education personnel will be developed as part of a human resources development&#13;
plan.&#13;
Building on the accomplishments of PASE I, the results of surveys, studies, an&#13;
evaluation of the education system and the recommendations made by various experts, the&#13;
Government has identified the following priority areas:&#13;
the efficiency of the education system;&#13;
t he quality of teaching and training;&#13;
-more equitable access to education.&#13;
In order to achieve this, the following actions are envisaged for the period 1995-2000:&#13;
Quantitative improvements and gains in efficiency&#13;
(a)    The establishment of a new MIEPUFP organizational structure as the result of the&#13;
operational audit of the central services and the extension of the functional reorganization to&#13;
the decentralized services (IRE and DPE), in conjunction with a systematic plan for the training&#13;
of professional and technical staff and the improvement of worldng conditions and&#13;
communications, particularly between the Ministry and the decentralized services.  The&#13;
ultimate objective is to make the department's general structure more performance-oriented by&#13;
more clearly defining the responsibilities of the various services, improving the circulation of&#13;
information and upgrading staff skills.&#13;
(b)    The construction of 780 classrooms per year and the gradual rehabilitation of existing&#13;
premises, particularly schools housing multigrade classes. All this will be backed by large-scale&#13;
awareness-raising efforts targeting local authorities, parent associations and friends of the&#13;
schools with a view to their assuming responsibility for building maintenance.&#13;
(c)    Building expansion and the rehabilitation of school premises at other education levels:&#13;
colleges and lyc&amp;es, vocational training centers.&#13;
(d)   The computerization of personnel management and the rationalization of qualifications&#13;
and jobs via reference to the legislation that governs training services and schools.&#13;
&#13;

through parent associations.&#13;
(d)   Improving the health of students in order to increase their capacity to learn, by&#13;
introducing health education and providing schools with pharmacies.&#13;
(e)   Improving the operating conditions in secondary schools through closer supervision of&#13;
the teachers, the supply of school textbooks and provision of equipment for the laboratories&#13;
and the Documentation and Information Centers. Students will also be evaluated on arrival&#13;
and departure from colleges and lycees with a view to adapting their training to the&#13;
professional requirements of the productive sector.&#13;
(f)    Establishing a small grants program aimed at jump-starting the process of introducing&#13;
innovations in teaching and learning while developing initiative at the prinary school level.&#13;
(g)   Implementing the national policy on technical education and vocational training in&#13;
keeping with the school mapping system, which is linked to regional economic development,&#13;
and conducting research on training methods in partnership with the private sector.&#13;

(i)   Incorporating introductory cultural and physical education activities into the programs,&#13;
particularly in the preliminary teacher training course.&#13;
()    Paying special attention, at every level of intervention, to the advancement of girls and&#13;
women, with a view to reducing the inequity of which they are victims: transversal and&#13;
multisectoral operations will be undertaken in order to provide them with greater access to&#13;
education and vocational training.&#13;
Upgrading of institutional capabilities&#13;
(a)   Examination and monitoring, on the occasion of joint meetings with PASE II donors,&#13;
of budgetary allocations and expenditures incurred on operations and investments, looking at&#13;
annual expenditures by education level and type of expenditure. These allocations and&#13;
expenditures should be sufficient to accomplish the following objectives:&#13;
-     to maintain the share of the MEPUFP budget in the State operating budget at 17.5%;&#13;
-     to allocate an amount for non-salary operating expenditures equivalent to US$7 [per&#13;
student] in primary education, US$5 of which for pedagogical materials; and the equivalent of&#13;
US$12 per student in secondary education, US$8 of which for pedagogical materials;&#13;
-     to gradually increase the share of primary education in the total education budget from&#13;
35% to 42% by the year 2000;&#13;
-     to hire 600 primary school teachers per year in the 1997/98, 1998/99 and 1999/2000&#13;
school years.&#13;
(b)   Increasing local community participation in the construction and maintenance of&#13;
primary schools and gradually getting the families, organized into student/parent associations,&#13;
to assume responsibility for their operation.&#13;
(c)   Promoting and expanding private education by facilitating access to permits for sites&#13;
and buildings and contributing to the smooth operation of these schools through pedagogic&#13;
oversight and supervision; this will call for institutional and legislative support at the central&#13;
level of the department responsible for private education, and of the decentralized agencies.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
EQUITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
TEXTBOOK PROVISION&#13;
I. PRIMARY EDUCATION&#13;
1. Context and justification. The Second Education Project financed a school textbook&#13;
production program, which resulted in the establishment of a publishing unit within the INRAP,&#13;
the publishing and distribution of three titles (a mathematics textbook, a science textbook and a&#13;
third-year history textbook) and the preparation of nine other titles. Within the framework of&#13;
the PASE I, four titles were published and distributed. These are a first-year reading-language&#13;
textbook, a first-year writing exercise book, a second-year reading-language textbook and a&#13;
fourth-year mathematics book.  Additional books have been donated through bilateral&#13;
assistance. Despite all these efforts, however, there is still a shortage of books in Guinean&#13;
primary schools. The book-pupil ratio in the basic subjects is currently one to every seven&#13;
pupils. Hence the urgent need to make up this shortage.&#13;
2. Objectives. The objective of this sub-component is to help improve the quality and equity&#13;
of the education system by: (a) improving the book-pupil ratio from one per seven pupils to&#13;
one per pupil in French, mathematics and science; (b) ensuring that this ratio is maintained&#13;
throughout the project by providing the copies needed to cover any increase in enrollment and&#13;
by having parents replace any students' books that are damaged or lost; and (c) financing the&#13;
training of professionals in the field of school textbook publishing.&#13;
3. Publishing Program. The publishing program includes 34 titles (17 school textbooks and&#13;
the corresponding teaching guides. See details below). This represents a production of&#13;
2,405,878 copies (2,362,033 textbooks and 43,845 guides). This will be achieved as a result of&#13;
the following assistance: (a) USAID will finance: (i) the reorganization of study programs ; (ii)&#13;
the preparation, editing and testing of textbooks; (iii) the revision of manuscripts and&#13;
preparation of films of the teaching guides; (iv) an awareness-raising and revitalization&#13;
campaign among Associations des Parents d' Eleves - APE (Parents/Teachers Associations);&#13;
and (v) teacher training in better use of school textbooks; (b) IDA will finance: (i) the revision,&#13;
graphic design, printing and delivery to Conakry of 17 student textbooks; (ii) the printing of 17&#13;
teaching guides; (iii) the delivery of the books to the schools; and (iv) the training of personnel&#13;
in school publishing.&#13;
4. Activities to be carnied out with IDA financing&#13;
(a) Book production and distribution&#13;
School textbooks:  The work of final revision, graphic design, printing, packing per&#13;
school/DPE and delivery to Conakry will be contracted out on the basis of an international&#13;
bidding competition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55                              Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
Teaching guides: The printing services will be procured on the basis of quotations from&#13;
national and foreign printers.&#13;
Delivery of the books to the schools: This will be handled by local private operators.&#13;
Reception of the books at the schools: This will be handled by panels [commissions] made&#13;
up, among others, of the school principals and teacher representatives, the APE/communities&#13;
and in the presence of the elders and union and political party representatives.&#13;
Bidding documents: Their preparation will be the responsibility of the DAAF/MEPUFP, as&#13;
will the monitoring of the procedures for the award and execution of contracts. The INRAP&#13;
will be responsible for drawing up the technical specifications for the books and for preparing&#13;
the stock management documents (i.e. delivery vouchers, stock files, etc.). The DNEE wil&#13;
draw up the list of all the primary schools with the quantities (per title) to be distributed to&#13;
each.&#13;
(b) Use of books and stock maintenance&#13;
The books will be the property of the schools, which will make them available to students&#13;
and teachers via a loan system. The parents of the students will make an annual contribution,&#13;
the amount of which will be determined by MEPUFP. These contributions will be used&#13;
exclusively to ensure that the books are kept in good condition and to replace any copies that&#13;
are damaged or lost in the course of the project. The money will be managed in the individual&#13;
schools by a committee placed under the authority of the Bureau of the APE and consisting of&#13;
five members: The President of the Bureau of the APE, the school principal, two teachers and&#13;
the Treasurer of the Bureau of the APE. In order to ensure that the schools are able to obtain&#13;
locally the books needed to replace copies that are damaged or lost, the INRAP will authorize&#13;
national private publishers to print the titles in question. The inspection programs will include&#13;
the control of stocks and of the efficient use of the books in the schools. Keeping books in&#13;
good condition and the efficient use of the books will, in future, be among the criteria used to&#13;
evaluate school principals and teachers.&#13;
(d) Stock replenishment. The replenishment of stocks will be funded out of the allocation to&#13;
the MEPUFP.&#13;
(e) Training. In order to help create a publishing unit in which the MEPUFP establishes the&#13;
pedagogical and technical specifications and whereby private publishers handle the production&#13;
and distribution of the books, six professionals (four from INRAP and two from DNEE) will&#13;
each receive a three-month scholarship for training abroad in the evaluation of school&#13;
textbooks and the formulation of their pedagogical and technical specifications.&#13;
II SECONDARY EDUCATION&#13;
Context and justification. The school textbook situation in the first cycle of secondary&#13;
education is disturbing. The book-pupil ratio is very low, approximately of one to four in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                               Annex 6&#13;
Page3 of 9&#13;
French, one to five in mathematics and one to more than ten in science. The books currently&#13;
available were donated and are, on the whole, ill-suited to current programs. In other words,&#13;
the quality of teaching and learning is being seriously jeopardized by the lack of books at this&#13;
level of education.&#13;
2. Objectives&#13;
This sub-component has the following objectives: (a) to improve the book-pupil ratio in&#13;
the first cycle of secondary education to (i) one book per student in mathematics, French and&#13;
physics, (ii) one book to two students in English and (iii) one teaching guide per teacher for&#13;
every student textbook. This represents a total of 584,950 copies (572,450 textbooks and&#13;
12,500 guides); (b) to rent out the books and use the proceeds to pay for the maintenance and&#13;
replenishment of stocks; (c) to train the teachers in the better use of books; and (d) to build or&#13;
rehabilitate storerooms to ensure that the books are better looked after in the schools.&#13;
Actions to be undertaken with IDA financing&#13;
(a) Procurement and distribution of books: School textbooks: These will be procured&#13;
from the market, using intemational competitive bidding, on the basis of pedagogical and&#13;
technical specifications and price. In order to facilitate distribution operations, the supplier will&#13;
be responsible for taking care of packaging per school and per DPE. Teaching guides: These&#13;
will be prepared by the INRAP, including the films. As regards printing, delivery and reception&#13;
at the schools, see the primary education sub-component, paragraphs 5, 6 and 7. Bidding&#13;
documents: The responsibilities of the DAAF,MEPUFP in terms of the invitations to bid are&#13;
indicated in paragraph 8 of the primary education sub-component. The DNES, for its part, will&#13;
be responsible for preparing, with assistance from the INRAP, the technical requirements and&#13;
pedagogical specifications for the bidding documents. The DNFS wiU also draw up the list of&#13;
all the schools, with the quantities of books (by title) to be distributed to each. It will also&#13;
prepare the stock management documents with assistance from the INRAP.&#13;
(b) Access to books. The books will be the property of the schools. The teaching guides will&#13;
be made available to teachers through a loan system. The textbooks will distributed to students&#13;
through a decentralized rental system. Each school will set up a committee responsible for&#13;
managing the book rental system, which will fix its prices in keeping with its particular&#13;
environment. The proceeds from the book rentals will be used exclusively: (a) to procure other&#13;
textbooks in order to maintain a good book-pupil ratio; and (b) to replenish stocks. The&#13;
estimated number of textbooks needed to maintain the required ratio and their estimated costs&#13;
are indicated below.&#13;
(c) Care and use of the books. A spirit of competition will be introduced arnong the different&#13;
schools at the first cycle of secondary education and the condition of the books and their&#13;
efficient use will be made evaluation criteria for the inspections of teachers and principals.&#13;
(d) Training. In order to present the teaching guides to the teachers, five regional seminars&#13;
will be organized, with a total of 300 teachers expected to attend. Each seminar will last five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57                               Annex 6&#13;

days. Seminars will also be organized in the 38 prefectures. Five seminars will be organized to&#13;
train those responsible for book stock management. These will be attended by a total of 200&#13;
people and each will last five days.&#13;
(e) Directives on stockkeeping and replenishment. During the first year of the project, the&#13;
Government will provide IDA with a draft of the directives on the care and replenishment of&#13;
the stocks acquired under the project. This draft will take the form of a Ministerial Decree&#13;
covering the following issues: (a) book ownership; (b) composition of receiving panels,&#13;
including observers; (c) the institution of a decentralized book rental system in the first cycle of&#13;
secondary school; (d) general arrangements for the organization and operation of the rental&#13;
system; (e) the autonomy to be given schools in the management of the book rental system; (f)&#13;
the composition and responsibilities of the management committees; (g) the collection and&#13;
safekeeping of funds and their exclusive use for ensuring the maintenance of a good book-pupil&#13;
ratio (i.e. to replace any copies that are lost or that become damaged and to cover any increase&#13;
in student enrollment), and for stock replenishment; (h) the responsibilities of principals and&#13;
teachers with respect to the care and efficient use of the books; and (i) the responsibilities of the&#13;
various control bodies. The draft Decree will have to be signed prior to the issuing of the&#13;
invitation to bid for the procurement of the books.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
EQUITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
SMALL GRANTS STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT&#13;
PROGRAM&#13;
Background. The implementation of the PASE showed that for in-service education&#13;
programs to be successfully translated into changed teacher behavior, they must match the&#13;
felt needs of teachers. However, in Guinea, as in most countries, existing programs are&#13;
very top-down in nature, often based on abstract pedagogical constructs and rarely&#13;
ground-truthed. They are generally centrally managed and do not account for local&#13;
variations in teacher and student needs. The Small Grants Staff Development and School&#13;
Improvement Program designed under the current operation seeks to address this&#13;
weakness by supporting stakeholder involvement in designing and carrying out an&#13;
innovative program of in-service education based on needs expressed by teachers&#13;
themselves. This program builds on existing structures to introduce teaching innovations,&#13;
and would help transform the role of regional and prefectoral inspectors from one of&#13;
administrative support to one of instructional support and leadership.&#13;
1. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES&#13;
Long-term Goals and Objectives. The long-term goal of the small grants program is&#13;
derived from Government's statement of education sector policy, i.e. to improve the&#13;
quality of teaching and learning in Guinean schools.  This program would be the&#13;
operational mechanism through which the school becomes the locus of change in the&#13;
education system. As such, the program is seen, not as a permanent feature of the&#13;
educational scene in Guinea, but as a key transitional program over a five-year period,&#13;
starting to redefine the role of teacher, principal, pedagogic advisor, and inspector. It&#13;
would have the following long-term objectives: to help teachers focus on improving&#13;
subject matter teaching; to help teachers improve their own knowledge base and teaching&#13;
ability; to introduce promising new approaches to teaching into the educational system; to&#13;
explore promising approaches to teaching in resource-poor environments; to promote&#13;
communication about promising approaches to teaching among all stakeholders; and to&#13;
promote girls' education.&#13;
Medium-term Goals and Objectives. The principal medium-term goals of the small&#13;
grants programs are to operationalize the Government's commitment to bringing about&#13;
school-based change within Guinean primary schools and to pass the message of the need&#13;
for qualitative change in teaching to all stakeholders. The medium-term objectives are the&#13;
following: help school personnel develop project proposals based on local school needs;&#13;
train inspectors and pedagogic advisors to provide instructional support to teachers and&#13;
school directors; develop a capacity for formative evaluation of initiatives capacity for&#13;
formative evaluation of initiatives capacity for formative evaluation of initiatives the&#13;
program; and ensure financial responsibility in the use of funds.&#13;

II. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
* Preparation of Proposals. As per the philosophy underlying the Government's&#13;
overall program, the teachers will prepare proposals for funding. They will form small&#13;
units for this purpose, either formed of teachers from a single school or from a group&#13;
of schools. These units can include parents or other community members involved in&#13;
the school. The units will be known as CREs (Cellules de renovation educative).&#13;
After identifying the key problem or problems their group wishes to address, the&#13;
members of a unit will submit a written prospectus to a prefectoral jury for pre-&#13;
selection. A guide to preparing prospectuses has already been prepared. Those&#13;
prospectuses selected by the prefectoral jury will be developed into full grant&#13;
proposals, with help from inspectors, pedagogic advisors, and normal school&#13;
professors who will have been trained for this purpose; these proposals will be&#13;
submitted to a regional jury for final selection.&#13;
* Selection of Proposals. The pre-selection at the prefectoral level, and the final&#13;
selection at the regional level will be based on the following criteria; evaluation&#13;
procedures and criteria are specified in the operational guidelines.&#13;
O  Educational Value of the Proposed Project&#13;
*        significance of the problems addressed by the proposal,&#13;
*        potential contribution to improving teaching and learning at the school(s) in&#13;
question,&#13;
*        probability of success in addressing identified problems,&#13;
*        sustainability of the approach beyond the end of the grant period,&#13;
*        potential for generalization of the approaches proposed,&#13;
*        potential benefit for target groups, especially the poor, rural students, and&#13;

Prefectoral jury members will read individual proposals and assign a score based on the&#13;
agreed criteria. The jury will then meet with representatives of the units, and will ask&#13;
questions for clarification as appropriate. The jury members will then deliberate and&#13;
prepare a final listing of the projects in order of scores assigned. Regional jury members&#13;
will work in similar fashion, except that representatives will not be able to make individual&#13;
presentations.&#13;
Facilitators. Immediately after the prefectoral pre-selection process, a facilitator will be&#13;
assigned to each unit chosen. The facilitators will be chosen from among the personnel of&#13;
the pre- and in-service education centers, the prefectoral education offices, and the&#13;
pedagogic advisors. They will be chosen based on experience and competence and will&#13;
initially make one visit each two weeks to the chosen school unit. Their first task will be&#13;
to help the unit develop its final proposal for the regional jury. For units surviving the&#13;
final selection process, the facilitators will visit schools twice a month for the first three&#13;
months and once a month thereafter. The facilitators will help CRE members become&#13;
reflective practitioners, and will lead them in appraising their own teaching practices and in&#13;
developing their potential for improvement. They will also provide a link with extemal&#13;
resource personnel as needed.&#13;
Evaluators. An evaluator will be assigned to each CRE after the final selection has been&#13;
completed and will be responsible for the formative evaluation of each initiative and will&#13;
be chosen from among the prefectoral directors of education, the personnel of the regional&#13;
inspectorate, the teachers at the teacher education institutes and the pedagogic advisors.&#13;
The evaluators will visit each CRE once a quarter to assess progress and will provide&#13;
advice to ensure that the project remains consistent with its objectives.&#13;
Training Programs. Training of evaluators and facilitators will be provided through&#13;
resource persons such as the directors of prefectoral education, the regional in-service&#13;
education coordinators or other resource persons available within a prefecture or region.&#13;
A national training group will be named by the ministry. The members of this group will&#13;
work with international consultants to develop the seminars and workshops for the&#13;
training of facilitators and evaluators and will serve as a backup throughout the project&#13;
life. Further short-term technical assistance will be provided through the national training&#13;
group in launch workshops at the beginning of each year for facilitators and CRE&#13;
representatives and in monthly meetings for facilitators. The training programs are&#13;
described in the operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;

Renewal of Funding. Proposals will cover a one-year period. The best initiatives can be&#13;
renewed for a second year, and in exceptional cases, a third year, upon recommendation of&#13;
the regional jury. Where an individual CRE is unable to complete its proposal within a&#13;
given year, the regional jury will decide whether to provide extra time for project&#13;
completion, with no additional funding.&#13;
First Phase of In-service Education.   This program  is a key element of the&#13;
Government's strategy for renewing in-service education over the project lifespan. The&#13;
improvement of teaching and learning sought under the Equity and School Improvement&#13;
Sector Investment Project must necessarily involve problem-solving based on the&#13;
pedagogic and institutional issues identified at the school level by those most directly&#13;
involved in the development of the education system--the classroom teachers. Reaching&#13;
this objective means that all stakeholders, at all levels, must fully understand the small&#13;
grants program--its philosophy, approaches to supervision, evaluation, etc. For this&#13;
purpose, the first phase of in-service education supported under this component will be a&#13;
series of seminars and workshops to include national, regional, and prefectoral officials.&#13;
The National Pedagogic Institute (INRAP), the Statistical Service (SSP), the Financial&#13;
Affairs Directorate (DAAF), the Elementary Education Directorate (DNEE) and the&#13;
Inspectorate-General (IGE) will participate in initial planning and training activities in&#13;
order to harmonize the role of each of these entities in this program. The agenda will&#13;
include the following points: information-discussion about the small grants program,&#13;
agreements concerning the specific role of each entity in implementing and sustaining the&#13;
program.&#13;
*  Regional Level. The Elementary Education Directorate (DNFE) will organize two-&#13;
day sessions bringing together the personnel from the regional and prefectoral&#13;
education offices. This session will present both the program philosophy and the&#13;
supervision, evaluation and support roles envisaged. The final version of the&#13;
operational guidelines, the proposal guides, the official texts, etc., will be distributed at&#13;
this seminar.&#13;
*  Prefectoral Level. Prefectoral-level meetings, organized by the IRE and the DNEE,&#13;
will bring together the prefectoral personnel and all of the sub-prefectoral education&#13;
officials. These individuals in turn will meet with all school directors and teachers in&#13;
the prefecture. This series of workshops will deal with the program's philosophy of&#13;
qualitative change in teaching and learning, its focus on equity concerns, and the&#13;
mechanics of preparing proposals and applying for funding, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Reports. Juries will prepare reports of their activities and decisions. Monthly summaries&#13;
of activities and expenses will be provided by the CRE to the facilitators, who will pass&#13;
them on to the DPE for transmission to the regional level. An end-of-year report will be&#13;
prepared by the CRE as per the criteria and issues outlined in the operational guidelines&#13;
including a brief personal reflection by each teacher on group dynamics, what has been&#13;
learned by participants, students, directors, etc., as a result of the project. The regional&#13;
coordinator will prepare monthly memos on project support; the evaluators will prepare&#13;
quarterly reports on the progress achieved by each school unit. These will indicate the&#13;
problems emerging in each unit in the course of implementation and the steps taken to&#13;
address these problems. They will show the extent to which project objectives are being&#13;
reached and draw lessons for activities of the following year. Finally, an annual report will&#13;
be prepared by the small grants coordinator and submitted to the Steering Committee and&#13;
to the World Bank providing an overall synopsis of the functioning of this component.&#13;
Managing the Process of Dissemination and Change. In order to ensure that the&#13;
lessons learned at the school level serve as a stimulus for the process of change in the&#13;
country, regional seminars will be held each summer.  They will bring together&#13;
representatives of all CREs funded during the previous year, as well as the other personnel&#13;
associated with the program (including representatives of newly funded CREs). The&#13;
format will be that of a professional conference followed by a plenary session. CREs will&#13;
be grouped according to the themes they have dealt with; each group will discuss the&#13;
generalizability of the results obtained. A national seminar will follow the regional&#13;
seminars each year (except the first year, when only one region is involved). Members of&#13;
CREs whose results are judged particularly pertinent for other prefectures or regions&#13;
would prepare presentations to be integrated into curriculum, teaching practices, and in-&#13;
service education programs in these areas. Where appropriate, outside funding would be&#13;
sought for innovative groups to present their findings at professional conferences outside&#13;
the country.&#13;
Administrative Structures. A five-person technical committee will oversee the small&#13;
grants program. Its chair will be the program coordinator, selected among the personnel of&#13;
the DNEE. The other four individuals will be chosen among existing personnel of the&#13;
DAAF, the IGE, the INRAP and the SSP. Specific responsibilities are given in the&#13;
operational guidelines. Five-person technical committees will also be established at the&#13;
regional level, comprising the regional inspector (chair), the director of the teachers'&#13;
training institute, the regional financial officer for education (SAAF), the regional statistics&#13;
director and the regional small grants coordinator.&#13;

Financial Arrangements. To disburse and account for the funds allocated to the small&#13;
grants program, various procedures have been proposed and continue to be discussed to&#13;
determine which offers the best assurance of efficiency and security of funds. A special&#13;
sub-account for the Guinea Equity and School Improvement Program will be established&#13;
and managed by the DAAF. Each of the regional SAAFs will be authorized to write&#13;
checks against this subaccount up to the budgeted amount for a particular accounting&#13;
period, both for the grants and for the necessary support activities (training, technical&#13;
assistance, etc.). The size of the grants will be small, averaging $750. A check will be&#13;
written by the SAAF to the treasurer of the CRE for each of three tranches. The second&#13;
and third tranche will be paid only upon presentation of satisfactory receipts accounting&#13;
for expenditures under the preceding tranche. The treasurer of each CRE will be&#13;
responsible for the funds. It is anticipated that in most cases, supplies and materials will&#13;
be purchased almost immediately upon receipt of funds. Where possible, remaining funds&#13;
will be kept at the nearest credit union (credit mutueo.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GUINEA&#13;
EQUITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
NUTRITION AND HEALTH COMPONENT&#13;
Students' Capacity and Motivation to Learn&#13;
1.    Students' capacity and motivation to learn is determined by the quality of the home&#13;
and school environments, health and nutrition status, and prior learning experiences,&#13;
including the level of parental stimulation. The principal source of children's capacity and&#13;
motivation to learn is the family, through genetic endowment and the direct provision of&#13;
nutrients, health care and stimulus. For children whose families are unable to provide&#13;
necessary inputs, substitutions can be provided by early childhood development programs&#13;
and school nutrition and health programs. Programs which focus attention on the&#13;
physical, cognitive and emotional development of young children improve their subsequent&#13;
performance in school. Likewise, addressing malnutrition and poor health at primary&#13;
school age can help children perform better and attend more regularly.&#13;
2.    Temporary hunger, chronic undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, parasitic&#13;
infections and vision and hearing impairments all serve to reduce a child's ability to achieve&#13;
in school. It was once thought that there was a vulnerable period in early childhood in&#13;
which poor nutrition and health would have permanent effects on children's learning&#13;
capacity. This is now known to be untrue, however, except for severe health and nutrition&#13;
deficiencies which inflict gross changes in the brain or irreversible physical damage. Most&#13;
children with a history of malnutrition and poor health, it is now known, are capable of&#13;
successful school performance, if they are compensated for their deficiencies.&#13;
Nutrition and Health Programs for School-Age Children&#13;
3.     For many of the poor nutrition and health conditions affecting school-aged&#13;
children, there are effective, safe and relatively inexpensive interventions. Mass delivery&#13;
of deworming drugs through schools and school-based vitamin A, iron and iodine&#13;
supplementation are some of the most cost-effective approaches to improving children's&#13;
readiness to learn via improved nutrition and health. Remedies are inexpensive and&#13;
providers do not require medical training. Such efforts at raising the nutrition and health&#13;
status of school children enhance other actions to improve primary education. They&#13;
improve the performance of children at school, and later as adults in the workforce.&#13;
4.    The benefit of nutrition and health improvements may be greater for girls than boys&#13;
and thus help to close the gender gap in education. Girls tend to suffer disproportionately&#13;
from some micronutrient deficiencies relative to boys. Interventions to improve nutrition&#13;
and health might also serve as incentives for enrolling both girls and boys in school.&#13;
Introducing nutrition and health interventions through schools also can correct health and&#13;
nutrition problems of public health significance in the community.&#13;

Nutrition and Health Status of School-Age Children in Guinea&#13;
5.    Visits to schools in Guinea and information from key informants indicate that&#13;
school-age children in Guinea suffer from conditions similar to those affecting school-age&#13;
children throughout the region. Primary among these are: parasitic infection, anemia,&#13;
iodine deficiency, vitamin A deficiency in parts of the country, malaria, and hunger. Other&#13;
chronic problems are scabies, diarrhea and respiratory infections. Specific data on&#13;
malnutrition in children under the age of five suggests the magnitude of the nutrition&#13;
problem for early primary school-age children. As much as 44% of children under five in&#13;
Upper Guinea suffer from chronic malnutrition, and from 18 to 40% in the other regions&#13;
of the country. Extremely low levels of adequate sanitation and hygiene -- many schools&#13;
do not have latrines or easy access to water -- increases the exposure of school children to&#13;
infectious diseases. The improvement of sanitary facilities in the primary schools is being&#13;
addressed through the construction and rehabilitation component of the Guinea Equity and&#13;
School Improvement Project.&#13;
6.    Parasitic Infections. Intestinal helminthiasis is a major problem for school-age&#13;
children in Guinea. For children over five years of age, it is the second most common&#13;
reason for hospital admissions after malaria. Ascaris (roundworm), A. duodenale and N.&#13;
americanus (hookworm) and Trichuris (whipworm) are highly prevalent helminthic&#13;
parasites that are also amenable to highly efficacious and safe chemotherapy.&#13;
Schistosomes are also a substantial problem. Children infected with these parasites are at&#13;
higher risk for undernutrition since they eat less and lose more nutrients than uninfected&#13;
children. These infections also independently contribute to poor school performance by&#13;
diminishing a child's ability to pay attention and concentrate. Children heavily infected&#13;
with parasites are also frequently absent from school.  A national parasite survey is&#13;
underway to provide specific information on the species of helminths and their prevalence&#13;
in various regions of the country.&#13;
7.    Iodine Deficiency. Surveys conducted over the past several years, some still in&#13;
draft form, and all including school-age children in their samples, indicate that iodine&#13;
deficiency is a serious problem in the country. The results show rates from 40% in Lower&#13;
Guinea to more than 70% in the other three regions of the country, indicating that all&#13;
regions are affected. Under the World Bank-assisted Health and Nutrition Project, the&#13;
provision of iodine supplements is being supported in Middle Guinea and selected areas of&#13;
Lower Guinea. UNICEF is also engaged in addressing the iodine deficiency problem&#13;
through the iodization of salt. It is expected that the entire country should have access to&#13;
iodized salt -- the medium- to long-term solution to iodine deficiency -- in about four&#13;
years. In the short run, iodine supplementation will need to be continued and expanded.&#13;
8.    The consequences of iodine deficiency can be most severe, and irreversible when&#13;
experienced in utero, causing, for example, mental retardation and deafness. However,&#13;
combating this deficiency, when it continues to exist in children, is important. There is&#13;
evidence of growth retardation and higher rates of morbidity in children with iodine&#13;
deficiency. School-age children deficient in iodine perform worse on intelligence and&#13;
other tests of learning capacity than iodine-replete children. Even sub-clinical deficiencies,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
recently, have been associated with lower scores on tests of non-verbal intelligence.&#13;
Iodine deficiency is also linked to impaired hearing in school-age children.&#13;
Nutrition and Health Component&#13;
9.    To begin to address some of these high priority problems among school-age&#13;
children, the Equity and School Improvement project will support school and nutrition&#13;
interventions that will complement other measures aimed at increasing access to school&#13;
and improving the quality of education. The interventions will be relatively simple and&#13;
within the capacity of the school staff (with some in-service training), and utilize the&#13;
prefectoral and sub-prefectoral level health and education infrastructure for&#13;
implementation. The component will: (a) implement, on a trial basis, a package of school&#13;
nutrition and health interventions including, the mass treatment of parasitic infections,&#13;
iodine and iron supplementation and health education; (Based on the results of the trial,&#13;
the package of interventions will be expanded throughout the country.); (b) reinforce&#13;
health education at primary schools through IEC; (c) undertake studies to set the stage for&#13;
addressing other school nutrition and health problems through parallel programming and&#13;
future operations; and(d) strengthen the capacity of the Department of School Health and&#13;
effectively link the provision of school health services with the provision of other health&#13;
services in the community.&#13;
Detailed Project Description&#13;
Objectives&#13;
10.   The overall goal of the component is to improve the nutrition and health of&#13;
primary school-age children. These improvements are intended to contribute to increasing&#13;
learning capacity, and thereby improve education effectiveness and efficiency. More&#13;
specifically, the component is designed to: (a) decrease the overall prevalence of parasitic&#13;
infection in school children, and in the entire community, served by the school-based&#13;
program; (b) decrease the prevalence of iodine deficiency in all target groups in&#13;
communities served by the program; and (c) improve iron status of children both through&#13;
reducing parasitic infection and iron supplementation.&#13;
Interventions&#13;
11.   The school nutrition and health component will include deworming and iodine and&#13;
iron supplementation as the principal interventions for primary school-age children. The&#13;
interventions will be tried in "trial run" areas, and if found to be effective at improving&#13;
child nutrition and health, and operationally feasible, the package will be extended to other&#13;
schools in the country. Other problems -- including for example, hunger, malaria, first aid&#13;
and primary health care needs -- will initially be examined through studies. If possible,&#13;
some of these problems will be addressed in future operations, or more immediately&#13;
through parallel programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
12.   Deworming. Children will be treated with either Mebendazole or Albendazole&#13;
(the choice of drug will be determined based on price estimated at US$0.20 to US$0.30&#13;
per dose), availability, and the prevalence of hookworm; Albendazole is more effective&#13;
against hookworm than Mebendazole. Also important to weigh in the selection is whether&#13;
Mebendazole is to be used as a one-day treatment (500 mg). Recently it has been found&#13;
to be effective as such, as opposed to the more common three-day dosage. Children will&#13;
be treated once per year in order to control, not eradicate infections. Treatment will be&#13;
provided at schools. The need to also treat children in certain areas with Praziquantel&#13;
(required once every several years) will be examined in the national parasite prevalence&#13;
survey currently underway.&#13;
13.   Drugs will be procured through the Central Pharmacy and delivered to health&#13;
centers in each sub-prefecture along with the routine delivery of essential drugs. The&#13;
deworming drugs will be held as separate stock at the health centers. The school and the&#13;
parents' associations (APE) will have joint responsibility for picking up the medicine at the&#13;
centers.  Most of the centers are within a bicycle ride of the school.  A simple&#13;
contract/letter of agreement will be drawn up and signed by the teacher-parent&#13;
associations to verify the medical supplies to be provided, and their use. A drug tracking&#13;
system will be devised by the school health department to account for all medicines&#13;
provided through the program. A health agent from the health center or health post will&#13;
distribute deworming drugs and iodine capsules once a year.&#13;
14.   Iodine Supplementation. Iodine capsules will be provided through schools in the&#13;
same manner as the deworming medicines. Estimated cost is US$ 0.22 per dose.&#13;
Children will be treated once per year at schools. The iodine will be procured and&#13;
delivered to schools through the same mechanism described above. The selection of&#13;
schools for iodine supplementation will be carefully coordinated with the other iodine&#13;
supplementation programs on-going in the country, and in accordance with the prevalence&#13;
of deficiency as determined by readily available surveys.&#13;
15.   Iron Supplementation. Iron capsules will be provided to children once per week&#13;
during the school year. This regimen will be monitored to see if it is possible to shorten&#13;
the duration of the treatment. The same delivery system will be used for the iron as for&#13;
the anthelminthics and the iodine. Teaching staff, or one or two designated teachers will&#13;
distribute the iron capsules.&#13;
16.   Information, Education, Communication (IEC). The package of interventions&#13;
will be accompanied by IEC to promote participation in the program, and to change&#13;
specific behaviors contributing to parasitic infection and iron deficiency. In the case of&#13;
parasitic infections the focus would be on the use of latrines, where they are available, and&#13;
other realistic health practices. Improving iron deficiency through education would&#13;
concentrate on practical dietary changes to enhance the consumption of iron. The&#13;
educational program will be developed based on qualitative research (focus group&#13;
discussion, key informant interviews), and utilize social marketing techniques for the&#13;
developing, testing and producing effective messages and materials. The relationship&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
developed with the communities during the implementation of the package of&#13;
interventions will facilitate this effort. Radio is extremely popular in the rural areas; the&#13;
potential to use this medium for education will be explored.&#13;
17.   Studies. Several potentially important school nutrition and health problems will be&#13;
investigated under the component. No specific interventions to address these problems&#13;
will be supported by the component, in order to keep the initial school nutrition and health&#13;
effort manageable and relatively low cost.  Based on the results of the studies,&#13;
interventions will be proposed for future operations or funded through other more&#13;
immediate sources, if possible. Areas for study include: (a) vitamin A deficiency in&#13;
school-aged children; (b) the prevalence of hunger in the school-age population, and&#13;
identification of possible mechanisms for alleviating this problem at schools (e.g., school&#13;
meals, improving the quality of food sold by vendors at schools, education program to&#13;
encourage feeding before school); and (c)the need, and feasibility of providing schools&#13;
with medicine chests. Such chests could include treatments for wounds, diarrhea, malaria,&#13;
scabies, etc.&#13;
Trial Run&#13;
18.   Implementation of the school nutrition and health intervention package detailed&#13;
above will begin with a "trial run". A "trial run" is not a pilot project, but rather a trying&#13;
out of the administrative and operational procedures for delivering the interventions. The&#13;
"trial run" will be implemented in six zones: one sub-prefecture in each natural region of&#13;
the country, Haute Guinea, Moyenne Guinea, Guinea Maritime, and Forest Guinea, as&#13;
well as in one urban zone outside Conakry and one in the periphery of Conakry. Ten&#13;
schools with approximately 150 children each in each zone will be selected to participate&#13;
in the "trial run". Additional children will be included in the trial run through outreach&#13;
efforts (see below). Criteria for selection will include: prevalence of parasitic infection and&#13;
strong support from the community for the interventions, and demonstrated interest and&#13;
capacity of the health and education staff at the prefecture and sub-prefecture level.&#13;
Ditinn sub-prefecture in Dalaba province, Tugnifilly sub-prefecture in Boffa province, and&#13;
Boffa Centre, an urban zone in Boffa province outside Conakry have already expressed&#13;
interest in participating in the "trial run".&#13;
19.   The "trial run" will last approximately one year. It will entail the following stages:&#13;
(a) discussion and planning with health and education personnel at the prefecture and sub-&#13;
prefecture level; (b) discussion and sensitization of the community served by the school&#13;
leading to signing a simple contract with the APE; (c) collection of baseline data on&#13;
parasitic infections, iodine deficiency, iron deficiency, and nutrition status (height and&#13;
weight); (d) development of a procurement, monitoring and control system for the drugs;&#13;
(e) development and implementation of a short in-service training program for health&#13;
agents, teachers, and others to be involved in the delivery of the interventions (training will&#13;
include the initial education measures to be included in the trial-run of the intervention); (f)&#13;
implementation and monitoring; (g) evaluation and recommendations for program changes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
as required. The mid-term evaluation will assess the impact on nutrition and health, and&#13;
also assess the operational aspects of the program.&#13;
Outreach&#13;
20.   Although the objective of the school nutrition and health component is to improve&#13;
student learning capacity by improving the nutrition and health of school children, the trial&#13;
phase will determine the need, feasibility, and effectiveness of reaching school-age children&#13;
who are not enrolled in school, as well as younger children, with these services. This is&#13;
most critical for iodine supplementation, if not provided through other programs since the&#13;
most serious consequences of deficiency occur in utero. Coverage also is important in&#13;
the mass treatment of parasitic infection. Low coverage translates into a need for more&#13;
frequent treatment since prevalence and intensity remain high and re-infection occurs more&#13;
rapidly.&#13;
21.   Health agents have a program for outreach to the community which has been used&#13;
for the vaccination program and delivery of prenatal care. Often the school has been the&#13;
point of delivery for these services.  Outreach for the school nutrition and health&#13;
interventions will build on this on-going program.&#13;
Expansion and Sustainability&#13;
22.   The package of interventions will be expanded to other communities/schools sub-&#13;
prefecture by sub-prefecture based on the results of the trial program. The expansion will&#13;
be gradual. Communities will be selected according to the same criteria used for the trial&#13;
program. If the trial run is successful both in effectively delivering the interventions and&#13;
improving the nutrition and health status of the target group, other funding will be sought&#13;
to finance the expansion of the component.&#13;
23.   The nutrition and health interventions should be sustainable where necessary&#13;
through a combination of changes in practices (through education) and direct community&#13;
support. Iodine supplementation is an interim measure which can be discontinued once&#13;
the iodization of salt is accomplished. Iron supplementation may also become unnecessary&#13;
in the long run if dietary practices are improved through education. In the medium term, if&#13;
donor funding becomes unavailable, the community can assist in supporting the iron and&#13;
deworming program. Initial visits and discussions with APEs confirmed their willingness&#13;
to make a financial contribution.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
24.   The Department of School Health under the Ministry of Public Health and Social&#13;
Affairs is responsible for developing and implementing all nutrition and health programs&#13;
and policies for school children.  Unlike many other countries where intersectoral&#13;
collaboration at the central level is extremely difficult, preventing the implementation of&#13;
intersectoral programs, the link between health and education is very strong at all levels in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
Guinea. At the Central level the school health department is managed by the Ministry of&#13;
Public Health and Social Affairs, yet it effectively functions within the infrastructure of the&#13;
Ministry of Pre-University Education and Vocational Training. Leadership in both of the&#13;
ministries is strong, and supportive of the initiative to improve school nutrition and health.&#13;
Under the current reform of the Health Sector, the School Health Department will shortly&#13;
become a more autonomous unit. Along with this new status will come additional&#13;
personnel and a larger budget.&#13;
25.   To contribute to strengthening the Department of School Health, the project will&#13;
provide: equipment and office supplies, transportation and operational support, training,&#13;
and technical assistance.  Technical assistance will be needed in: management and&#13;
logistics, IEC (information, education, communication), micronutrients and parasites,&#13;
training and evaluation.&#13;
26.   Implementation will be decentralized. The sub-prefecture will play the key role in&#13;
the operation of the program, supervised by the prefecture level. Health and Education&#13;
agents exist at both the sub-prefecture and the prefecture levels, and collaborate well&#13;
together. Jointly they will visit communities and discuss school health issues and the&#13;
program. Specific responsibilities at the sub-prefecture level will include: sensitizing the&#13;
community, receiving medicines and supplies; delivering deworming drugs and iodine&#13;
supplements to children; training teachers in education/communication; monitoring&#13;
implementation of interventions at the schools; receiving and aggregating individual school&#13;
reports of program activities; assisting in implementing evaluations; and serving as the link&#13;
between the schools and the prefecture level of the program.&#13;
27.   The prefecture level and central Department of School Health will be responsible&#13;
for ensuring the effective delivery of the program (supervision) to the sub-prefectures, and&#13;
planning and implementing evaluations, studies, and training programs. The central&#13;
Department of School Health will also collaborate with other ministries and other donors&#13;
participating in related activities and establish and maintain national-level program data&#13;
and information.&#13;
28.   The APEs will be responsible for implementing the program at the schools. They&#13;
will pick up the medicines, assist in establishing a system for distribution at the school,&#13;
receive training, participate in any other activities related to the school nutrition and health&#13;
program, and provide all necessary feedback and information to the sub-prefecture health&#13;
and education agents.&#13;

EQUITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
1.   IDA Supervision Input. Regular supervision needs are described in Table 1 of this&#13;
Annex. In addition, specific tasks such as review of progress reports, terms of reference, annual&#13;
plans, audits, and procurement and disbursement actions, are estimated to require 8 staff weeks of&#13;
various specialist inputs a year which are not included in Table 1.&#13;
2.    Borrower's Contribution to Supervision. The monitoring and evaluation of project&#13;
progress and outcomes will be integrated with the monitoring system established in the M:EPUFP&#13;
for the reform program, with the overall responsibility assigned to the Steering Committee.&#13;
(a)   Progress Reports will be submitted twice a year, in January and July. They will include a&#13;
summary of implementation under each project component, financial statements on project&#13;
expenditures, updated project implementation and procurement schedules, as well as the&#13;
status of contract advertising, bidding, awards and completion dates and compliance with&#13;
aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement. The Steering Committee, in&#13;
collaboration with the DAAF, will collect inputs from each responsible MEPUFP&#13;
directorate and prepare the reports.&#13;
(b)  Joint Annual Reviews. Once a year, around November, the Steering Committee will&#13;
organize a joint IDA/Government review of project implementation based on the progress&#13;
report in the above paragraph which, for the purposes of the annual review, will also&#13;
include: (a) an annual work program and budget for the next academic year; (b) a draft&#13;
budget for the overall education sector for the next year; and (c) the status of policy and&#13;
project monitoring indicators as listed in Annex 5.&#13;
(c)   Mid-Terrn Review. The Steering Committee, together with the DAAF, wiU carry out not&#13;
later than 30 months after credit effectiveness, a mid-term review of the progress made in&#13;
carrying out the project. They will cover all aspects of the project, with a special focus&#13;
on: (a) MEPUFP's functioning; (b) progress in implementing policy measures and their&#13;
impact on staffing, cost and efficiency of the system, and the increase in girls'&#13;
participation; (c) progress with the recruitment of teaching staff, (d) implementation of&#13;
small-grants initiative; (e) progress of school construction and rehabilitation program; (f)&#13;
progress in identifying reforms initiatives in support of private schooling at the primary&#13;
level; (g) progress in the evaluation of future VET prograrn; (h) progress in implementing&#13;
the health program and its impact on student learning outcomes; and (i) findings of the&#13;
beneficiary assessment. The mid-term review will also be conducted with other donors&#13;
affiliated with the project (e.g., USAID, France, FED) and will review progress in the&#13;
implementation of their programs.&#13;
(d)  The Steering Committee will be responsible for coordinating arrangements for IDA&#13;
supervision missions and participating in the missions with them.&#13;
(e)  Implementation Completion Report. Within six months of the Credit closing date, a&#13;
completion report, prepared in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
will be transmitted to IDA.&#13;

            The Government of Guinea adopted the
            National Program for Education for All in 1990. The
            objectives of this program was to expand the gross primary
            school enrollment rate from 28% to 53% by the year 2000, to
            increase the efficiency of resource use within the sector,
            to increase overall Government support for basic education,
            and to improve the quality of education. The strategy has
            been updated in a Statement of Education Policy. This policy
            well be supported through the implementation of the second
            phase of a multidonor sector investment program. The
            long-term objectivess of the Equity and School Improvement
            Project are: (a) increase primary school enrollment and
            completion rates, with a strong focus on girls and students
            in rural areas; (b) improve teaching and student learning in
            primary and lower secondary schools; and (c) strengthen
            educational system management.
