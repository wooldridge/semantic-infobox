Foreword&#13;
The management of solid waste is integral to city sanitation. Over the last decade, larger cities,&#13;
especially those with financial and managerial capacity, have attempted to improve waste&#13;
management practices in response to the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Rules 2000. In this, the&#13;
development of disposal infrastructure, i.e., sanitary landfills, has made the least progress due to&#13;
factors ranging from land scarcity to lack of technical and financial capacity in cities. These challenges&#13;
are further accentuated in smaller Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).&#13;
&#13;
Recognising these challenges, the Government of India and key stakeholders have been deliberating&#13;
upon mechanisms and arrangements to facilitate compliance with requirements for treatment and&#13;
safe disposal of solid waste. In this context, regional arrangements for waste managementâ&#128;&#148;whereby&#13;
a single, relatively large site is developed to serve the waste disposal requirements of a group of&#13;
ULBsâ&#128;&#148;provide a way forward for pooling of resources to address some of the challenges in MSW&#13;
management. Regional facilities may incorporate treatment as well as disposal facilities, and generate&#13;
sufficient scale to enhance technical and financial efficiencies. Furthermore, they facilitate the&#13;
monitoring of environmental outcomes and performance due to a reduced number of sites. The&#13;
approach enables smaller ULBs to achieve compliance with minimal financial burden.&#13;
&#13;
Due to the multi-ULB nature of such arrangements, however, state governments are required to play a&#13;
lead role in planning and initiating a regional approach. At the same time, MSW management is a&#13;
core and statutory function of ULBs, which remain responsible for service delivery. In this respect,&#13;
entities entrusted with developing and operating regional facilities will need to remain directly&#13;
accountable to the ULBs.&#13;
&#13;
The objective of this Guidance Note is to identify and address issues in the implementation of regional&#13;
arrangements for delivery of MSW management services. While some of these are common to all&#13;
MSW management initiatives, there are specific issues that need to be addressed in the context of&#13;
regional arrangements. By focusing on these, it is hoped to facilitate the establishment of regional&#13;
initiatives to enhance compliance with the MSW Rules 2000.&#13;

Preface&#13;
Solid waste management is one of the most significant functions carried out by ULBs. However, the scarcity of&#13;
suitable landfill sites is one of the constraints increasingly being faced by ULBs in the discharge of their functions.&#13;
As a result, even several years after the issuance of the MSW Rules 2000, the state of MSW management systems in&#13;
the country continues to raise serious public health concerns.&#13;
Regional or inter-municipal solutions provide a viable option to redress this situation. Working together can be a&#13;
practical and cost-effective way to discharge common tasks, share resources, and take advantage of the economies&#13;
of scale that such arrangements would provide. This is applicable in the case of both large municipal bodies&#13;
which experience scarcity of land resources, as well as smaller ones which may find technical and financial&#13;
resources a challenge.&#13;
Therefore, in public interest and with the aim of improving standards of public health and sanitation in the states,&#13;
the Government of India has developed this Guidance Note on regional solid waste management to facilitate the&#13;
creation of appropriate strategies by the states and ULBs. This note is the result of work done over a period of&#13;
about 18 months, and aims to support decision making towards the implementation of regional arrangements for&#13;
safe treatment and disposal of MSW.&#13;
&#13;
Regional approaches to MSW management are common in several countries, and have recently gained&#13;
momentum in a few states in India. Studies undertaken attest to the importance of two factors in the successful&#13;
implementation of regional initiatives: (a) an explicit policy, supporting the adoption of regional approaches; and&#13;
(b) a robust institutional framework, underpinning development and implementation.&#13;
In this respect, it is intended that this Guidance Note may form the basis for states to formulate and notify state-&#13;
level policy directives to recognise regional initiatives, strategies to encourage their adoption, and tools to facilitate&#13;
implementation. The Note also includes a few case studies illustrating frameworks and implementation strategies&#13;
adopted in other jurisdictions and sectors. Frameworks observed include legislation supporting municipalities to&#13;
prioritise regional initiatives to effectively use available resources as well as options for:&#13;
&#13;
   Creation of regional solid waste management authorities or entities empowered by law to undertake waste&#13;
   management activities over a region or state;&#13;
   Creation of solid waste management â&#128;&#152;regionsâ&#128;&#153;; and&#13;
&#13;
   Municipalities jointly constituting a company, or common authority, to implement a regional waste&#13;
   management project.&#13;
&#13;
These can be facilitated by statutory mechanisms for municipalities to work together.&#13;
I would like to thank the various state governments and ULBs associated with this initiative; and recognise the&#13;
inputs of the Water and Sanitation Program, which has partnered with the Ministry in developing this Note.&#13;
I indeed hope that this Guidance Note will contribute towards a more effective realisation of the objectives of&#13;
the MSW Rules 2000.&#13;

   1               Background and Need for the Guidance Note&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The responsibility for solid waste management lies      Regional MSW projects/regional infrastructure&#13;
with the respective Urban Local Bodies (ULBs),          facilities provide an economically viable, technically&#13;
consisting of municipal corporations,                   and environmentally efficient, and effective alternative&#13;
municipalities, nagar panchayats, etc., (collectively   for the Authorities to discharge their obligations to&#13;
referred to as the â&#128;&#152;Authoritiesâ&#128;&#153;). The Municipal        provide scientific collection, management, processing&#13;
Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules,            and disposal of MSW effectively (Annex 1).&#13;
2000 (the â&#128;&#152;MSW Rulesâ&#128;&#153;), issued by the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Forests, Government of India,           A â&#128;&#152;Regional MSW Facilityâ&#128;&#153; means a waste&#13;
under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,           management facility or system of any kind (whether&#13;
prescribe the manner in which the Authorities have      in relation to collection, transportation, treatment or&#13;
to undertake collection, segregation, storage,          disposal of MSW or a combination of any or all of&#13;
transportation, processing and disposal of the          them), which collects, manages or receives or&#13;
municipal solid waste (the â&#128;&#152;MSWâ&#128;&#153;) generated             disposes (as the case may be) MSW from more than&#13;
within their jurisdiction under their respective        one Authority.&#13;
governing legislation.&#13;
                                                        A â&#128;&#152;Regional MSW Projectâ&#128;&#153; means a project to either:&#13;
Compliance with the MSW Rules requires that             (a) develop and/or construct and/or operate, maintain&#13;
appropriate systems and infrastructure facilities be    and/or manage any type of new Regional MSW&#13;
put in place to undertake scientific collection,        Facility; or (b) convert and/or redevelop an existing&#13;
management, processing and disposal of MSW.             MSW facility or system from being a facility used by a&#13;
However, it has increasingly come to the attention      single Authority into a Regional MSW Facility. A&#13;
of the national (and state) government that,            Regional MSW Project can cover, within its scope, any&#13;
individually, the Authorities are unable to             existing MSW management facilities or systems&#13;
implement and sustain separate and independent          within the jurisdiction of an Authority.&#13;
projects to enable scientific collection, management,&#13;
processing and disposal of MSW. This is mainly          Thus Regional MSW Facilities or Regional MSW&#13;
due to lack of financial and technical expertise and    Projects would help the Authorities to share technical&#13;
scarcity of resources, such as land and manpower,       expertise, costs of development and management of&#13;
with the Authorities, which makes it difficult for      infrastructure and scarce natural resources, such as&#13;
them to discharge their obligations individually in     land, and consequently help in provision of scientific&#13;
relation to scientific collection, management, and      collection, management, processing and disposal of&#13;
processing and disposal of MSW.                         MSW in an efficient manner within respective&#13;
                                                        states (Annex 1).&#13;
The Government of India recognises that the&#13;
existing state of MSW management systems in             Nothing in this Regional Solid Waste Management&#13;
the country is also raising serious public health       Guidance Note (â&#128;&#152;RSWM Guidance Noteâ&#128;&#153;) shall&#13;

           2               Objective of RSWM Guidance Note&#13;
&#13;
     The main objective of this RSWM Guidance Note                     Reduce the financial and technical burden on&#13;
     is to propose an enabling policy framework that                   each individual Authority and help the&#13;
     would provide guidance and direction in                           Authorities discharge their obligation for&#13;
     planning, development, implementation and                         MSW management in a cost-effective manner&#13;
     management of such Regional MSW Projects in                       with better technologies;&#13;
     the country. It is expected that Regional MSW&#13;
     Projects will enable:                                             Result in more efficient use of land and other&#13;
                                                                       scarce natural resources within the region; and&#13;
        Authorities to aggregate the waste quantities&#13;
        generated across their respective jurisdictions                Enable better management and easier&#13;
        to take advantage of economies of scale in                     monitoring, with an optimal number of MSW&#13;

&#13;
     The first attempt at developing a regional facility in India was by Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority&#13;
     (AUDA), in 2007, to address the SWM requirements of 11 towns in its (then) jurisdiction. Located at&#13;
     Village Fatehwadi, the facility integrated composting facilities for approximately 150 TPD; and the first cell&#13;
     of a scientific landfill site of 50 TPD capacity. The overall strategy included the development of three&#13;
     transfer stations.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                               13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  3              Implementation Through Private Participation&#13;
&#13;
The Government of India recognises the&#13;
magnitude, scope and nature of: (i) investment;&#13;
(ii) technical expertise; and (iii) resources&#13;
required for a viable Regional MSW Project.&#13;
Most Authorities face shortages of technical and&#13;
managerial staff and systems. A regional project&#13;
will enable the Authorities to discharge their&#13;
statutory municipal waste management&#13;
functions in a scientific and viable manner in&#13;
accordance with applicable laws. A regional&#13;
project can be implemented either through:&#13;
(a) a government body/utility that may be&#13;
specifically incorporated for implementing such&#13;
regional projects in the state (which may&#13;
thereafter implement through its own staff, or&#13;
contract out activities); or (b) through a Public    Transfer station, Rajkot city, Gujarat, India. Small&#13;
                                                     vehicles climb a ramp to empty waste into larger&#13;
Private Partnership (PPP) structure, wherein a&#13;
                                                     vehicles stationed at a lower level. Transfer stations&#13;
concession is granted by the land-owning entity      enable costs of transportation over longer distances to&#13;
(state or lead ULB).                                 be optimised.&#13;
&#13;
A robust PPP framework will be based on&#13;
the following principles:                               greater private participation and fair sharing of&#13;
                                                        risks between private participants and&#13;
Provide for a framework that permits private            municipalities; and&#13;

while working on Waste Management Plans,                  sites in the region. In 1998, six of the original 10 local&#13;
Canterbury City and most of the District Councils         authorities elected to develop waste management&#13;
found that the final cost per tonne for disposal was      facilities at the regional level through a joint venture&#13;
significantly higher than their original estimate.        (JV) in partnership with the private sector. The&#13;
They found that the approach to develop individual        partnership would enable the local authorities to&#13;

The 10 Canterbury local authorities came together to&#13;
form a Canterbury Waste Joint Standing Committee             Potential access to their financial resources;&#13;

The basic model that was arrived at was for initial                       clusters of ULBs, alternative sites for a shared landfill&#13;
treatment of wastes, through vermi-composting, to                         were identified using geo-informatics and CPCB&#13;
be undertaken individually by each ULB, to reduce                         recommended criteria. The effort focused on&#13;
volumes to be transported for land filling. Individual                    government owned wastelands closest to the largest&#13;
ULBs were required to identify sites for vermi-                           generator of waste in each cluster. The sites identified&#13;
compost facilities on the basis of area and location                      were acquired and handed over to GUDC for&#13;
criteria provided. Each vermi-composting facility                         development. The super-clusters thus demarcate&#13;
was also to serve as a transfer station at the ULB                        the state into 12 zones for the purposes of solid&#13;

Simultaneously, GUDC began the process of                                 resources of almost Rs. 169 crore. This large gap was&#13;
clusterisation, land identification and acquisition for                   instrumental in the adoption of: (a) prudent&#13;
regional facilities in a coherent manner. The                             technology choices and efficiencies in procurement;&#13;
clustering of ULBs for disposal arrangements was                          and (b) strategies to draw in private sector&#13;
finalised through an iterative processâ&#128;&#148;the final                          investment in the programme. Standardisation and&#13;
clusterisation, using a maximum travel distance of                        centralised procurement of equipment for collection&#13;
50 km, led to the identification of over 20 clusters,3                    and transportation as well as for contracting of&#13;
each with a regional landfill site. For each of the                       construction of treatment facilities were adopted,&#13;

As a result of prudent and efficient management,                              The Governing Council (apex body) of the&#13;
STEM Water Authority was able to generate                                     company consists of the mayors and&#13;
substantial revenues from its operations.4 From 2003                          commissioners of three cities, the Chief Executive&#13;
onwards, the participating ULBs started discussions to                        Officer (CEO) of Thane Zila Parishad, and the&#13;
further clarify and establish the legal status of STEM,                       Executive Director of the company.&#13;

          1                  Landfills: Economies of Scale&#13;
&#13;
     Even when there are effective and reliable systems for processing of waste, there will still be a need for&#13;
     engineered landfills to dispose rejects, residues (from treatment processes) and non-biodegradable waste.&#13;
     Therefore, an engineered landfill is an integral component of a scientific waste management system.&#13;
&#13;
     The cost of construction of engineered landfill sites is dependent on many factors including the size of the&#13;
     landfill, site conditions, availability of materials locally, manpower costs, etc. Among various factors affecting&#13;
     the construction costs of landfills, the size of the landfill is observed to be most significant due to the&#13;
     following reasons:&#13;
&#13;
       Cost of construction per unit area/per unit of waste quantity reduces with the increase in the size of the&#13;
       landfill. One single large landfill of a given size would always be less expensive to construct as compared to&#13;
       several smaller sites aggregating to the same area, because the necessary infrastructure that must be&#13;
       provided on all sites (weighbridge, administrative block, site roads, storage area, etc.) can be used more&#13;
       intensively on larger sites. Moreover, the proportional spending on items such as boundary walls and buffer&#13;
       planting is lower for a large site;&#13;
&#13;
       Given a fixed side slope, a greater height can be achieved with a larger base area. Therefore, more waste can be&#13;
       placed per unit area of larger landfill sites, resulting in a lower per tonne cost of land filling; and&#13;
&#13;
       Equipment (such as bulldozers and other specialised machinery) can be used more intensively on a large&#13;
       site. Moreover, more specialised and efficient machinery can be justified at larger sites due to the greater&#13;
       work loads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        Larger landfills can be utilised to a greater height, that is, they contain a&#13;
                                                        greater load per unit area of land.&#13;
                                                        For example, assume a square land area of â&#128;&#152;x2â&#128;&#153; m&#13;
                                                        Land filling is done up to a height of â&#128;&#152;yâ&#128;&#153; m above ground level (GL) and&#13;
                                                        a depth of 5 m below GL.&#13;
                                                        Side slopes of 1V:4H (above GL) and 1V:3H (below GL) are maintained.&#13;
                                                        Then, the area and total air space available for land filling for different&#13;

&#13;
     2                ULBs: Rationale for Regionalisation&#13;
&#13;
The following factors will influence the decision of a ULB to participate in a regional landfill facility for safe&#13;
disposal (the facility may include facilities for treatment also):&#13;
&#13;
A. Land Constraint: If a ULB does not have a sufficiently large and suitably located site for the development of&#13;
its own sanitary landfill facility to meet the requirement of the MSW Rules 2000. Requirement of land should&#13;
be estimated in such a manner that the site is capable of serving the needs of the ULB for a period of at least 20&#13;
years, and is located in accordance with the criteria specified by CPCB for the siting of landfill sites.&#13;
&#13;
B. Travel Distance: The savings accruing from the development and operations of a regional landfill will&#13;
compensate for the increased cost of transportation over longer distances (refer to the section on transporting&#13;
wastes to a regional facility). However, the distance of the proposed regional landfill facility from the&#13;
participating ULBs should not significantly increase transportation costs for the participating ULBs to such an&#13;
extent as to marginalise the other benefits of using a regional landfill. On the other hand, in the absence of any&#13;
other viable alternative, ULBs may consider incurring higher transportation costs in order to meet regulatory&#13;
requirements for the safe disposal of waste.&#13;
&#13;
C. Quantum of inerts/rejects to be land filled: If the quantum of inerts/rejects to be land filled by the ULB is&#13;
small, the justification for participation in a regional facility is stronger, since the costs incurred by the ULB in&#13;
developing and operating its own landfill facility will be significantly higher than the costs incurred in a&#13;
regional facility. For example, as presented in the section on Financial Analysis, the cost of developing a&#13;
landfill to dispose 75 TPD of rejects is only four times more than the cost of developing a landfill to dispose&#13;
10 TPD of rejects, although the waste to be land filled has increased 7.5 times.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           3                Financial Analysis: Standalone versus&#13;
                            Regional Landfill Facility&#13;
&#13;
     The following financial analysis has been carried out to estimate the financial benefits of a regional&#13;
     arrangement as against a standalone landfill. The assumptions for this analysis have been derived from&#13;
     financial details of similar projects in ULBs across the country.&#13;
&#13;
     The factors considered for the analysis are:&#13;
&#13;
        Development cost for a standalone landfill and regional landfill; and&#13;
&#13;
        Transportation infrastructure cost in case of a regional landfill.&#13;
&#13;
     The facilities are assumed to be developed under a Build Operate Transfer (BOT) concession-based tipping fee&#13;
     structure. The tipping fee is arrived at to achieve a project return of 15 percent. The tipping fee payable by a&#13;
     ULB for development and O&amp;M of a standalone landfill facility has been compared with that payable for&#13;
     development and O&amp;M of a regional landfill facility.&#13;
&#13;
     For the purposes of the analysis, it has been assumed that the waste generated is treated at the ULB level, and&#13;
     only rejects are transported to a regional landfill facility, located at an average distance of 40 km from each&#13;
     participating ULB. Since small ULBs would normally not have large trucks for long haul transportation, the&#13;
     private operator could be required to procure and maintain the transportation infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;

     C. Scenario Analysis&#13;
&#13;
     A scenario analysis has been carried out to analyse the financial implications on a ULB in case of the&#13;
     development of a standalone landfill facility as against the impact of participating in a regional landfill&#13;
     (assuming that, in both cases, the facility is developed under a BOT concession, and a tipping fee is applicable&#13;
     per tonne of waste disposed).&#13;
&#13;
     Scenario A: ULB to develop its own treatment and disposal facilities.&#13;
     Scenario B: 4 ULBs have individual treatment facilities but one common regional landfill facility within a&#13;
     40 km distance of each ULB.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                     51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In both cases, the assumptions underlying the tipping fee estimation are:&#13;
   Concession period                                    20 years&#13;
   Promotersâ&#128;&#153; equity                                    25%&#13;
   Debt                                                 75%&#13;
   Interest rate                                        14%&#13;
   Repayment period                                     10 years&#13;
   Project return                                       15%&#13;
   Escalation in costs                                  5â&#128;&#147;10% (depending upon item)&#13;
The above analysis has been carried out for ULBs assumed to be generating 40 TPD and 80 TPD waste.&#13;
The results are presented below.&#13;
&#13;
I. For 10 TPD of landfill waste&#13;
The Available Waste Quantity (AWQ) to be land filled by each ULB is 10 TPD, and hence the cost of&#13;
development of a standalone landfill is Rs. 4.8 crore. In case of a regional landfill facility for all four ULBs,&#13;
AWQ would be 40 TPD, and hence the cost of development of a regional landfill facility would be Rs. 11.6&#13;
crore with an additional cost of Rs. 0.18 crore for the transportation infrastructure for each ULB.&#13;
&#13;
In this analysis, the two scenarios are considered as shown in Table A5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Table A5          Landfill Facility for 10 TPD of Waste to be Land Filled from Each of the 4 ULBs&#13;
&#13;
   Scenario                                     Tipping fee (Rs./tonne)                  Rs. crore/Annum/ULB&#13;
   Scenario A                                   3,000                                    0.41&#13;
   Scenario B                                   1,950                                    0.70&#13;
&#13;
It may be seen from Table A5 that in case of four ULBs (each generating 40 TPD of waste) coming together and&#13;
forming a regional landfill, there are savings of 35 percent, even after paying for the transportation (Scenario B&#13;
includes transportation costs).&#13;
&#13;
II. For 20 TPD of landfill waste&#13;
The AWQ to be land filled by each ULB is 20 TPD and hence the cost of development of a standalone landfill is&#13;
Rs. 7.1 crore. In case of a regional landfill facility for all four ULBs, AWQ would be 80 TPD and hence the cost&#13;
of development of a regional landfill facility would be Rs. 19.9 crore, with an additional cost of Rs. 0.18 crore&#13;
for the transportation infrastructure for each ULB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Table A6          Landfill Facility for 20 TPD of Waste to be Land Filled from Each of the 4 ULBs&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
   Scenario A                                   2,000                                    1.46&#13;
   Scenario B                                   1,425                                    1.04&#13;
&#13;
There is a significant saving from four ULBs producing 80 TPD of waste coming together and forming a&#13;
regional landfill, even after paying for the transportation cost. Further, it can be noted that, on larger ULBs&#13;
coming together, the financial benefits decrease.&#13;

&#13;
     MSW 2000 Rules require municipal solid wastes to be treated before rejects/inerts are land filled. The&#13;
     argument is often made that ULBs should receive and treat/process the waste generated at the ULB level&#13;
     (within the jurisdiction of the ULB, or in the vicinity of the ULB), to reduce the quantum of rejects and inerts&#13;
     that is transported over longer distances for land filling at the regional landfill facility, which may be at a&#13;
     distance of over 30 km from each participating ULB. This pre-supposes that the participating ULBs have access&#13;
     to a suitable site to develop and undertake treatment of wastes (through own resources or by contracting PSP).&#13;
&#13;
     The decision whether to undertake treatment at the ULB level or to integrate treatment and disposal facilities&#13;
     at the regional level lies with each participating ULB. Several factors will influence the ULBâ&#128;&#153;s decision. Each of&#13;
     these factors assumes a different priority, depending upon the ULBâ&#128;&#153;s particular context. It is thus proposed&#13;
     that each ULB consider each factor or criteria, and accord a weightage to each factor in accordance to its&#13;
     situation, followed by a rating of each factor. The comparison of cumulative marks of each option would&#13;
     enable the ULB to make an informed and logical decision.&#13;

Note: Weightages are suggested only. ULBs may change the suggested weightages in accordance with their particular situations. For&#13;
example, a ULB that has access to suitably sited land for establishing treatment facilities, and can hence obtain clearances easily, may&#13;
want to reduce the weightage suggested for this particular criterion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This assessment will enable the ULB to make a sound decision on the extent of its participation in the regional&#13;
facility. It should be borne in mind, however, that a minimum quantum of waste must be ensured in order to&#13;
ensure the viability of treatment processes also. If treatment facilities are to be integrated with the sanitary&#13;
landfill in the regional facility, the sum of the waste committed by various participating ULBs must be&#13;
adequate to justify the technology proposed to be deployed and operations.&#13;

                                    Facility: Estimating the Costs&#13;
&#13;
     Sending wastes to regional facilities for treatment and/or land filling will entail an increase in transportation&#13;
     costs for the participating ULBs. This may be offset, to a certain extent, by the lower cost (value) of land at a&#13;
     greater distance from the ULB as well as savings in costs of development and operation of landfill facilities&#13;
     due to economies of scale.&#13;
&#13;
     Each participating ULB can estimate the transportation cost involved by undertaking the following&#13;
     assessment. Increase (or savings) in costs can thus be estimated to inform the decision of whether to&#13;
     transport the entire mixed waste generated6 to the regional facility or treat the waste at the ULB level, prior&#13;
     to transportation.&#13;

     Thus a ULB generating 300 TPD will incur an additional expenditure of approximately Rs. 76.1 lakh/annum&#13;
     in transporting the entire waste collected to a regional facility, as against transporting rejects/inerts alone.&#13;
     This needs to be viewed vis-a-vis the expenditure that would be incurred in establishing and operating a&#13;
     treatment facility at the ULB level.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                     57&#13;

     6               Transporting Wastes to a Regional Facility:&#13;
                     Estimating the Optimum Travel Distance&#13;
&#13;
In order to estimate the maximum distance beyond which transportation cost for rejects to the landfill become&#13;
unviable, the annual O&amp;M cost for regional landfill operations added with the cost for waste transportation&#13;
for the given distance should be compared with the O&amp;M cost for the standalone landfill. For better&#13;
understanding, one set of calculations is provided below as a sample:&#13;
&#13;
  Typical cost estimate for various quantity of waste for landfill operations has been provided in Table A8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Table A8       Typical Cost Estimate for Development of Landfill for Varying Waste Quantities&#13;

&#13;
  Capital cost (in Rs. crore)            4.82                 7.11               11.58            18.67&#13;
&#13;
  Annual O&amp;M cost (in Rs. crore)         0.36                 0.37               0.57             0.65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  A typical cost estimate for transportation of waste through varying distances has been provided in Table A9.&#13;
&#13;
  The capital cost for the regional landfill option along with the capital cost for transportation infrastructure&#13;
  would always be lower than in the case of the standalone landfill option for handling of waste quantities up to&#13;
  75 TPD, for the transportation distances considered below. However, it may be noted that in calculations&#13;
  provided, the capital cost for the development of a transfer station has not been considered, which may be&#13;
  required (for improved cost efficiency) beyond a distance of 40 km.&#13;
&#13;
  In order to compare O&amp;M costs for a regional arrangement against a standalone option, the calculation of&#13;
  O&amp;M cost for both options have been considered for a 20 TPD (standalone facility) and a 75 TPD regional&#13;
  landfill. The calculations indicate that the O&amp;M cost for a regional landfill would exceed the standalone option&#13;
  beyond approximately 65 km distance.&#13;
&#13;
Annual O&amp;M cost (20 TPD landfill)â&#128;&#148;Rs. lakh: 37&#13;
Annual O&amp;M cost (75 TPD landfill)â&#128;&#148;Rs. lakh: 65&#13;
&#13;
Annual O&amp;M cost for ULB contributing 20 TPD to the 75 TPD landfillâ&#128;&#148;Rs. lakh: 17.33&#13;
Effective savings for ULB generating 20 TPD rejectsâ&#128;&#148;Rs. lakh: 19.67&#13;

      Guidance                    MANAGEMENT ON A&#13;
          Note                    REGIONAL BASIS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Referring to Table A9, it can be seen that the annual O&amp;M cost for transporting 20 TPD over a distance of&#13;
     70 km is Rs. 21.10 lakh. Thus the savings in landfill operations may be used for transporting the waste up to an&#13;
     optimal distance of approximately 65â&#128;&#147;68 km. Beyond this, the option of participating in a regional landfill&#13;
     arrangement will become more expensive for a ULB generating 20 TPD of rejects.&#13;
&#13;
     While this is an illustration of the argument, it is recommended that every ULB undertake an estimation of costs in its&#13;
     specific context to arrive at a financially viable distance for transporting waste.&#13;

            India - Municipal solid waste management on
            a regional basis
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Government of India has developed
            this Regional Solid Waste Management (RSWM) Guidance Note on
            regional solid waste management to facilitate the creation
            of appropriate strategies by the states and Urban Local
            Bodies (ULBs). This note is the result of work done over a
            period of about 18 months, and aims to support decision
            making towards the implementation of regional arrangements
            for safe treatment and disposal of Municipal Solid Waste
            (MSW). Its main objective is to propose an enabling policy
            framework that would provide guidance and direction in
            planning, development, implementation and management of such
            Regional MSW Projects in the country. It is expected that
            Regional MSW Projects will enable Authorities to aggregate
            the waste quantities generated across their respective
            jurisdictions in order to take advantage of economies of
            scale in transportation, processing and disposal of MSW;
            reduce the financial and technical burden on each individual
            Authority and help the Authorities discharge their
            obligation for MSW management in a cost-effective manner
            with better technologies; result in more efficient use of
            land and other scarce natural resources within the region;
            and enable better management and easier monitoring, with an
            optimal number of MSW management projects.
