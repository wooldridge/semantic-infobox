EMERGENCY SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
A.    BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
Country background&#13;
1.    Abundant natural and human resources enabled Iraq to attain the status of a&#13;
middle-income country in the 1970s. The country developed good infrastructure and&#13;
well-performing education and healthcare systems, widely regarded as the best in the&#13;
Middle East. Income per capita rose to over US$3,600 in the early 1980s. Since that time,&#13;
successive wars and a repressive, state-dominated economic system have stifled growth&#13;
and development and debilitated basic infrastructure and social services. International&#13;
trade sanctions imposed in 1991 took a toll on the economy. Despite the country's rich&#13;
resource endowment, Iraq's human development indicators are now among the lowest in&#13;
the region, and income per capita dropped to about US$770-1,020 by 2001, with&#13;
continued decline thereafter. Although there is a paucity of reliable economic data, 2003&#13;
GDP is estimated at about US$13-17 billion, or about US$480-630 per person, assuming&#13;
a population of about 26.3 million.&#13;
Current Challenges and International Response&#13;
2.    Following the recent war, Iraq faces enormous challenges and the situation is still&#13;
evolving. In addition to a complicated political transition, Iraq needs to rebuild social&#13;
cohesion and implement a transition from a centrally planned economy to a diversified&#13;
market economy. It will be particularly important to mitigate the temporary adverse&#13;
effect of reforms on the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
3.    A Needs Assessment covering fourteen sectors, prepared jointly in 2003 by the&#13;
World Bank and United Nations Development Group (UNDG), and with the participation&#13;
of the International Monetary Fund, estimated that Iraq requires about US$36.0 billion&#13;
over four years, and the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) estimated separately that&#13;
Iraq requires about US$19.0 billion over four years for areas such as security and oil&#13;
which are not covered by the Needs Assessment.&#13;
4.    At an International Donors' Conference for Iraq in Madrid on October 23-24,&#13;
2003, donors expressed support for the Needs Assessment and pledged about US$32.0&#13;
billion for the four-year period covered by the Needs Assessment. Donors also asked the&#13;
World Bank and UNDG to set up an International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq&#13;
to ensure swift, flexible, and coordinated donor financing for priority investments&#13;
consistent with the Need Assessment. The Facility consists of two trust funds-a World&#13;
Bank Iraq Trust Fund and a UTNDG Trust Fund-each with its own internal governance&#13;
procedures and a management structure that ensures close coordination. Donors in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
follow-up meeting in Abu Dhabi (February 18-29, 2004) allocated US$100 million for&#13;
the education sector to finance the Emergency Textbook Provision Project (ETPP) and&#13;
the current Emergency School Construction and Rehabilitation Project (ESCRP).&#13;
Education Sector&#13;
5.    The education system in Iraq was widely regarded as one of the best in the Middle&#13;
East region until the 1980s. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, Iraq made great progress&#13;
in enrollment at all levels of education and achieved near universal primary enrollment&#13;
by 1980. For the last decade of the twentieth century, the system deteriorated seriously as&#13;
Iraq engaged in three major conflicts and experienced over a decade of international&#13;
sanctions.&#13;
6.    Primary school enrollment fell to 93 percent in 2000, while secondary school&#13;
enrollment went from 47 percent to 38 percent. More serious, however, was the large&#13;
drop in attendance. A UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) reported in&#13;
2000 that as many as 23 percent of primary school-aged children were not attending&#13;
school, with significantly higher rates among girls and in rural areas. This deterioration&#13;
created or exacerbated existing gender, urban/rural and regional inequities. Other sub-&#13;
sectors, especially technical and vocational education, also experienced stagnation or&#13;
decline.&#13;
7.    Quality also declined at all levels of the education system: teaching and learning&#13;
conditions deteriorated; teacher quality eroded; curriculum content was distorted or&#13;
became outdated; and policy and system development came to a standstill. This decline in&#13;
quality was reflected in deteriorating internal efficiency, made worse by growing poverty.&#13;
Indeed, poverty emerged as the major cause of non-attendance, as households assumed&#13;
more of the direct costs of provision despite the official policy of free education.&#13;
8.    Behind these developments was a substantial collapse in public expenditure in the&#13;
education system. In 1988/1989 the education budget was US$2.5 billion (about 6&#13;
percent of GDP) and expenditure per student was approximately US$620. Over the 1993-&#13;
2002 period, the annual average expenditure per student stood at approximately US$47,&#13;
funded largely from the Oil-for-Food Program.&#13;
9.    The need for repair and rehabilitation of schools is substantial. The Ministry of&#13;
Education (MOE) Situation Analysis, building on the UN/WB Joint Needs Assessment,&#13;
identified almost US$700 million in urgent repair and reconstruction needs over the next&#13;
three years, and US$80.0 million per year in textbook requirements. In 2004, 18,181&#13;
schools in Iraq are operating in 14,120 buildings creating a need for over 4,000 new&#13;
buildings (Annex 7, Table 1). More than 30 percent of schools are operating in double or&#13;
triple shifts in shared premises (Annex 7, Table 2). Of the 12,000 schools requiring&#13;
repair, almost 2,600 require minor repairs (less than US$10,000 per school), over 9,400&#13;
require major repair and reconstruction, and around 1,300 need to be demolished and&#13;
rebuilt. UNICEF is committed to repairing and rehabilitating 300 schools in 2004;&#13;
USAID will commit to repair and reconstruct a portion of the US$87.0 million from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
US$18.6 billion Supplemental Allocation in 2004. The MOE is also looking to the Bank&#13;
for support in meeting its target, based on the UN/WB Joint Needs Assessment, to repair&#13;
and reconstruct damaged schools.&#13;
10.   The priorities identified in the UNDG/WB Joint Needs Assessment were endorsed&#13;
by the Minister of Education at a meeting in Amman in October 2003 attended by senior&#13;
officials from the MOE, the World Bank, UNICEF, UNESCO, USAID and the CPA.&#13;
These priorities are included in the MOE Situation Analysis ("Education in Iraq: Current&#13;
Situation and New Perspectives") of December 2003.&#13;
11.   In the Amman consultation, agreement was reached between the MOE and Iraq's&#13;
major development partners on the following priorities: (i) capacity building for the&#13;
development of a strategic framework for the sector, (ii) providing emergency&#13;
reconstruction and supplies (including textbooks), (iii) initiating curriculum reform&#13;
process, (iv) addressing immediate needs in teacher training, and (v) initiating policy&#13;
dialogue on technical/vocational education and training (TVET).&#13;
12.   International experience of education reform and reconstruction in postconflict&#13;
societies underlines the importance of quick and visible high impact activities to address&#13;
the most urgent system needs backed by intensive capacity building for the education&#13;
authorities. This is necessary to lay the groundwork for the development of a&#13;
comprehensive education strategy that is aligned with the emerging wider development&#13;
vision of the new political authorities. The successful resumption of schooling in Iraq in&#13;
September 2003 was an important achievement. However, the education sector remains&#13;
fragile, and recent momentum can only be maintained if minimum conditions for learning&#13;
are established in schools for the 2004/2005 school year. This priority needs to be part of&#13;
a more comprehensive process of capacity building for wider system reform and&#13;
modernization.&#13;
B.    BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
13.   In January 2004, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors discussed an&#13;
Interim Strategy Note of the World Bank Group for Iraq and authorized the Bank to act&#13;
as administrator of the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund.&#13;
14.   The World Bank Group's interim strategy, which initially covers the period&#13;
February-October 2004, focuses on: (i) building Iraqi capacity which is urgently needed&#13;
for the reconstruction program; (ii) preparing and implementing emergency operations to&#13;
generate employment and restore essential infrastructure and services; and (iii) laying the&#13;
foundation for the medium-term program, through studies and policy advice.&#13;
15.   The strategy relies on the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund to finance projects, and on&#13;
Bank budget for economic and sector work and policy advice. The interim work program&#13;
includes four proposed projects amounting to US$400-600 million. These will be&#13;
financed from the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) to the extent resources are available (projects&#13;
will be phased if insufficient resources are available). A multi-sectoral institutional&#13;
capacity building program has already commenced. The Interim Strategy originally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
provided for a single Emergency Education Rehabilitation Project (EERP) that&#13;
incorporated textbook provision in the ETPP, together with school rehabilitation&#13;
activities in the present ESCRP. In order to ensure delivery of textbooks at the start of the&#13;
2004-2005 school year, the EERP was split into the latter two education projects. Other&#13;
projects under fast-track preparation include emergency community-based rural&#13;
infrastructure and emergency infrastructure reconstruction. The interim strategy also&#13;
includes building blocks of analytical work to support the transition to a diversified&#13;
market economy and the development of a social protection system. Analytical work has&#13;
been grouped into three clusters: economic reform and transition, public sector&#13;
management, and poverty and safety nets; and two sectors: health and education.&#13;
16.   The Bank was the lead agency for education in the UNDG/WB Joint Needs&#13;
Assessment, and has worked closely with UNICEF, UNESCO, USAID, and the CPA. It&#13;
is well positioned to play a significant role in repair and reconstruction as well as&#13;
capacity building for reform. The Bank has considerable accumulated experience in&#13;
supporting large scale construction and rehabilitation projects in post-conflict settings.&#13;
The support for school rehabilitation is complemented by a range of capacity building&#13;
activities in key policy areas such as education reform, education management, teacher&#13;
policy, curriculum development, TVET and Higher Education.&#13;
17.   Lessons from Postconflict Experience Applied. Based on the World Bank's recent&#13;
experience in post-conflict countries such as East Timor, Bosnia, Algeria, Sierra Leone,&#13;
West Bank/Gaza and Kosovo, a number of important lessons have been leamed and&#13;
factored into the design of the project. First, experience has shown the value of early and&#13;
visible impact, and the importance of rapid resumption of normal schooling operations to&#13;
permit the education authorities to focus energy on wider system reform. This project&#13;
targets that issue directly. A second lesson is the importance of capacity building in the&#13;
ministry. This project is complemented by a range of capacity building activities in the&#13;
ITF Capacity Building Project. A third lesson is the importance of early and effective&#13;
collaboration with other development partners coordinated by the government. The&#13;
project draws upon the extensive collaboration with other development partners that have&#13;
been active in Iraq, and builds on complementary activities coordinated by the MOE.&#13;
Finally, because of the particular difficulties of implementation and supervision where&#13;
security conditions make access to the country very difficult, the project draws on&#13;
experience gained in other comparable post-conflict countries, such as Algeria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C.    DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Objectives&#13;
18.   The principal objective of the Project is to improve conditions of learning in&#13;
primary and secondary schools through the construction of new buildings for existing&#13;
schools in unsafe or shared facilities, and rehabilitation of schools in need of urgent&#13;
repair.&#13;
Component 1: Construction and Rehabilitation of Primary and Secondary Schools&#13;
(US$58.57 million)&#13;
19.   The grant will finance the construction of new buildings for about 110 primary&#13;
and secondary schools in unsafe or overcrowded facilities, and the rehabilitation of about&#13;
140 schools. The project will construct and rehabilitate schools in all 18 governorates.&#13;
Schools selected for the construction of new buildings will be (i) those in unsafe&#13;
structures; (ii) schools sharing facilities in double or triple sessions; (iii) schools that have&#13;
clearly identified sites that meet the environmental and social safeguard criteria. The&#13;
grant will also finance services of consulting firms for design and supervision of civil&#13;
works. Where rehabilitation projects have to be implemented during school terms, the&#13;
MOE will transfer students to other nearby schools or buildings and/or use double shifts.&#13;
For works with adverse impacts, a limited Environmental Analysis will be done before&#13;
the sub-project approval.&#13;
20.   School buildings constructed under the project (110) will address less than 3&#13;
percent of the backlog and will be undertaken in all the governorates of Iraq. Most of the&#13;
governorates will have five to seven new school buildings each and the large Baghdad&#13;
govemorate will have ten buildings. The construction of new buildings will provide&#13;
spaces for 42,000 students in primary and secondary schools at an average cost of&#13;
US$1,150 per student place. The buildings will be constructed in three phases at a total&#13;
cost of US$48.4 million at an average cost of US$414,000 per school.&#13;
21.   The number of schools to be rehabilitated is quite small compared to the needs of&#13;
the country. There are about 9,400 schools that need major rehabilitation or&#13;
reconstruction (85 percent of the total schools). Project schools make only 2 percent of&#13;
the total number of schools that need to be rehabilitated.&#13;
22.   A large number of the schools (32 schools) to be rehabilitated under the project&#13;
are in Baghdad governorate and most of the other govemorates have a share of about 10&#13;
schools each. The rehabilitation of schools will benefit 45,700 primary and secondary&#13;
students at a total cost of US$7.6 million and an average cost of US$181 per student. A&#13;
large number of benefited students will be in large govemorates such as Baghdad&#13;
governorate (13,600 students) and in other high demand govemorates like Najaf (2,700&#13;
students) and Babylon (2,300 students). The average rehabilitation cost per student is&#13;
reasonable compared to the benefits of increasing access and improving the learning&#13;
conditions for about 45,700 students.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Component 2: Project Management and Capacity Building (US$1.43 million)&#13;
23.   The grant will finance the basic costs of the Project Management Team (MOE-&#13;
PMT) to manage the project, together with the technical assistance and capacity building&#13;
to ensure transfer of skills to the MOE staff. The MOE will cover the costs of the staff of&#13;
the MOE-PMT, except for up to five consultants employed from project funds to fill key&#13;
capacity gaps. The grant will finance equipment, vehicles, furniture and operating costs&#13;
necessary to manage the project. Operating costs include (i) the maintenance of office&#13;
equipment purchased by the grant; (ii) transportation and travel, including per diem&#13;
allowances for Project staff in travel status; (iii) rental of office space; (iv) office&#13;
supplies, utilities and office administration, including translation, printing and&#13;
advertising; (v) fuel costs; (vi) communication costs; (vii) costs for production of bidding&#13;
documents; (viii) commercial bank charges; and (ix) any other Project management&#13;
support costs as agreed by the MOE and the Bank, but excluding salaries of the civil&#13;
servants. It will also finance TA and training in project management, procurement and&#13;
financial management, as well as audit costs. Further details of the arrangements for&#13;
project management are provided in Section D.&#13;
D.    INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
24.   Project scope. The physical reconstruction component will cover all 18&#13;
govemorates: Each govemorate has one MOE directorate, except Baghdad which has&#13;
four, making a total of 21 directorates in the project.&#13;
Project Management Structure&#13;
25.   The Project will adopt the Management Structure put in place for ETPP (Annex&#13;
2).&#13;
26.   The MOE suffered major dislocation and loss of human, technical and&#13;
institutional resources as well as its physical infrastructure and is in a transitional phase.&#13;
It has major logistical and sectoral challenges and needs time to reorganize, restructure&#13;
and build its capacity to manage the sector. In view of this situation, it was agreed that a&#13;
"core team" of senior MOE staff and hired consultants (where expertise is lacking) will&#13;
constitute the Project Management Team (MOE-PMT) responsible for day-to-day&#13;
implementation of both the ETPP and the ESCRP. The MOE will have overall&#13;
responsibility for the coordination and execution of all project activities, and will be&#13;
guided by a Project Advisory Committee (PAC) as described below.&#13;
27.   MOE directorates at the governorate level suffered less dislocation and there is&#13;
sufficient technical expertise to serve most project needs. Therefore, these Directorates&#13;
will be fully engaged in the implementation of the project and will be expected to provide&#13;
information and assistance to the MOE-PMT. Project coordinators will also be assigned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
at the school level, especially in those schools that are major beneficiaries. The functions&#13;
and responsibilities of these coordinators are described in the Project Implementation&#13;
Manual (PIM) scheduled for completion in December 2004.&#13;
28.   Proposed Staffing of the MOE-PMT. The MOE-PMT will be headed by a Project&#13;
Team Leader and include at least 10 professional-level staff depending on project&#13;
requirements. It is expected that five MOE-PMT staff will be senior MOE officials and&#13;
five will be consultants hired to bring external expertise for the life of the two projects&#13;
(ESCRP and ETPP) while transferring capacity to MOE staff. The staff of the MOE-PMT&#13;
will receive special training and orientation in the critical aspects of project management.&#13;
The MOE-PMT will be responsible for planning and coordination of all project activities,&#13;
financial management (accounting and disbursements), procurement of works, goods and&#13;
consulting services (and related contract management), environmental analysis and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation to ensure timely implementation and coordination of all&#13;
project activities.&#13;
29.   The MOE-PMT will work closely with the School Building Departments of the&#13;
Directorates which are staffed with competent planners and engineers to assist in&#13;
planning, coordination and supervision at their respective governorates.&#13;
30.   Use of Consulting Firms for Design and Supervision Services. The MOE-PMT&#13;
will hire consulting firms to assist in modifying standard designs in accordance with the&#13;
findings of the soil investigation of each site. The consultants will modify a foundation&#13;
and site plans to suit the conditions of each site where necessary. In addition, the&#13;
consultants may be required to support the work of the DEO engineers in contract&#13;
administration and supervision of contracts. It is strongly recommended that the hiring of&#13;
these firms begin as soon as possible.&#13;
31.   Proiect Advisory Committee (PAC). Project oversight will be provided by the&#13;
PAC, chaired by a representative of the MOE, comprising members from the Ministries&#13;
of Planning and Development Cooperation (MOPDC), Finance (MOF), and Construction&#13;
and Housing (MOCH). The Committee will meet at least quarterly to: (i) ensure&#13;
accomplishment of the project objective, (ii) oversee and guide project design, (iii)&#13;
facilitate coordination with key ministries and donors, (iv) monitor key project progress,&#13;
and (v) ensure adequate operational and maintenance funding. The PAC will endorse&#13;
annual plans and budget allocations.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
General&#13;
32.   Procurement for this project will be carried out in accordance with the World&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under LBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004;&#13;
and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"&#13;
dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Trust Fund Grant Agreement. The&#13;
general description of various items under different expenditure categories is given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
below. For each contract to be financed by the grant, the procurement methods or&#13;
consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review&#13;
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and the Bank project&#13;
team in the Procurement Plan (PP). The PP will be updated as required to reflect the&#13;
actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. A&#13;
general procurement notice was published in the UNDB on March 26, 2004 and will be&#13;
revised after approval.&#13;
33.   Procurement of Works. Works procured under this project will include school&#13;
construction and rehabilitation. Due to the small value of each contract and to the volatile&#13;
security conditions in Iraq, it is not expected that international contractors will be&#13;
interested in the works contracts. All procurement of works will follow National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) or Shopping. Thus no contract is expected to be procured&#13;
using International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures; however, international&#13;
contractors would be eligible to bid on NCB contracts if they choose to participate. The&#13;
procurement based on NCB procedure will be done using the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Document (SBD) for small works. Once an NCB bidding document for works is prepared&#13;
(currently under preparation as part of the master implementation manual), reviewed and&#13;
found satisfactory to the Bank, it will be used instead of the Bank's SBD for NCB&#13;
procurement.&#13;
34.   Procurement of Goods. The estimated cost of goods under the project is&#13;
US$400,000. Goods procured under this project will include vehicles, office furniture,&#13;
computers and engineering equipment and office supplies needed by the MOE-PMT and&#13;
the DEOs for the project implementation. The procurement will be done using NCB,&#13;
Shopping procedures, and in exceptional cases, Direct Contracting may be used for&#13;
procurement of goods of small values such as office supplies and equipment as described&#13;
in the procurement plan. No contract is expected to be procured using International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures; however, international suppliers would be&#13;
eligible to bid on NCB contracts if they choose to participate. The procurement based on&#13;
NCB procedure will be done using the Bank's SBD for procurement of goods. Once an&#13;
NCB bidding document for goods is prepared (currently under preparation as part of the&#13;
master implementation manual), reviewed and found satisfactory to the Bank, it will be&#13;
used instead of the Bank's SBD for NCB procurement.&#13;
35.   Selection of Consultants. Consultant services procured under this project will&#13;
include: (i) selection of an international procurement consulting firm to build MOE-PMT&#13;
and DEOs capacities to carry out and manage procurement activities; (ii) selection of&#13;
individual consultants and/or firms to provide training; (iii) capacity building in financial&#13;
management; (iv) and selection of local consulting fims to provide consultancy services&#13;
in school design and construction supervision. The procurement consulting firm&#13;
(estimated cost US$250,000) will be selected based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ)&#13;
procedures.&#13;
36.   Operating Costs: The grant will finance expenditures directly related to the&#13;
management of the project such as: (i) maintenance of office equipment and vehicles; (ii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
transportation and travel, including per diem allowances for Project staff in travel status;&#13;
(iii) rental of office space; (iv) office supplies, utilities and office administration,&#13;
including translation, printing and advertising; (v) fuel costs; (vi) communication costs;&#13;
(vii) costs for production of bidding documents and drawings; (viii) commercial bank&#13;
charges. No salaries of the Recipient's civil servants will be financed under the project.&#13;
The operating costs that will be financed by the project will be procured using the MOE&#13;
administrative procedures for shopping satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement&#13;
37.   Procurement activities will be carried out by the MOE. The MOE Engineering&#13;
and Schools Building General Directorate (ESBGD) has 23 engineers. There are 74 civil&#13;
engineers distributed across School Buildings Directorates (SBDs) of all the&#13;
governorates, with 12 in Baghdad and a minimum of 3 in every govemorate. In Baghdad-&#13;
center there are three engineers who are familiar with procurement, and training in WB&#13;
procurement has been provided by the MOE-PMT to the staff of five govemorates. In&#13;
Sulaymaniyah, a general tender committee is responsible for all procurement in the&#13;
governorate. The ESBGD staff and the SBDs staff in the govemorates have experience&#13;
in school construction and rehabilitation. During 1993 and 1994, the MOE rehabilitated&#13;
more than 5,000 schools with an estimated value of more than the equivalent of&#13;
US$120,000,000. To strengthen the procurement capacity of the MOE staff, a&#13;
procurement officer is already working on the ETPP and has received training on&#13;
procurement and procurement plan preparation. He is qualified to handle and follow&#13;
procurement aspects of this project and the ongoing ETPP. A simple PIM is under&#13;
preparation (it is expected that the manual will be ready by December 31, 2004) and the&#13;
MOE-PMT will use this manual in the implementation of the project. The PIM will be&#13;
aligned with the Master Implementation Manual (MIM) as soon as the later becomes&#13;
available.&#13;
38.   Private Sector Assessment. The private sector, local and foreign, participate in&#13;
public procurement of goods and services. Registration of national contractors by the&#13;
MOPDC, is a routine practice. Contractors are classified and ranked against criteria&#13;
including experience, performance, and financial status. A procuring entity may limit the&#13;
invitation to bid to certain classes of contractors. There are some 160 local contractors&#13;
with class A rating. Class A is considered the highest in the classification system of&#13;
contractors union in Iraq.&#13;
39.   A significant number of contractors expressed their interest to participate in the&#13;
ESRP in response to one advertisement published in July 2004 in a local newspaper in&#13;
Baghdad. This response reveals that all the govemorates have a minimum of 15&#13;
contractors and a maximum of 20 contractors (class 1-5). Baghdad Govemorate received&#13;
responses from 130 contractors (class 1-5). Except for Baghdad, no govemorate has more&#13;
than 7 contracts for building new schools in this project. One of the biggest contracts will&#13;
be in Thiqar governorate for an amount of US$950,000, for which the governorate&#13;
received responses from 18 contractors (class 1-5). The design of the procurement plan of&#13;
the project in dividing the work into different phases will also allow qualified contractors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
with capacity to participate in bidding for more than one contract at different phases. On&#13;
the basis of the above information and analysis, it can be assumed that private sector&#13;
contractors will be able to complete and execute the contracts under this project.&#13;
40.   A generic assessment of MOE's capacity to implement project procurement was&#13;
conducted in March 2004. Given that the security conditions prevented the Bank project&#13;
team from traveling to Iraq at the time of project preparation, a quick assessment of the&#13;
capacity of the MOE to implement procurement actions for the project was also carried&#13;
out by the team's Senior Procurement Specialist during March-April 2004 and October&#13;
2004 through discussions with MOE staff in Jordan during the pre-appraisal and appraisal&#13;
of the project. Subsequently, the generic assessment has been revised to reflect the&#13;
MOE's capacity to implement procurement.&#13;
41.   The Bank procurement specialist has already provided training to the MOE&#13;
procurement staff who will conduct procurement as well as other MOE staff. The training&#13;
included procurement planning, bidding document preparation, procurement guidelines,&#13;
procedures and methods for procurement of works, goods and selection of consultants.&#13;
Further procurement training on bid evaluation was conducted during the Project&#13;
appraisal mission and MOE-PMT Training Workshop (June 2004) and through a video&#13;
conference with Baghdad and will continue throughout project implementation by the&#13;
procurement consulting firm and during the Project launch workshop.&#13;
42.   The overall project risk for procurement is rated as high. Most of the issues and&#13;
risks concerning the procurement component for implementation of the project have been&#13;
identified in the generic assessment of the MOE's capacity to implement project&#13;
procurement and include: (i) the lack of sound laws and regulations, of modern standard&#13;
documentation, and the habits acquired by procurement staff in the previous era which&#13;
will take time to change; (ii) weakness of procurement staff in use of Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines and international sound procurement practices; (iii) inability of Bank&#13;
procurement staff to supervise the project in the field; (iv) delays in implementing the&#13;
procurement plan due to lack of experience in procurement planning and the volatile&#13;
security conditions in Iraq; (v) increase of prices of construction raw materials due to&#13;
high demand and unavailability of these material which may impact subprojects&#13;
completion due to the unwillingness of contractors to continue working based on old&#13;
contract prices; (vi) possible looting of construction sites and (vii) due to deteriorated&#13;
security conditions in some areas in Iraq, delays could be expected in the implementation&#13;
of some contracts as well as in bid submission.&#13;
43.   The corrective measures which have been agreed upon are: (i) a procurement&#13;
officer is already hired as part of the MOE-PMT; (ii) simplified bidding documents and&#13;
methods such as shopping and NCB, a Bank bidding document for simple works, and the&#13;
US Dollar as currency of bids for NCB and shopping will be sued; (iii) in the contract, a&#13;
statement will be included that contractors will be responsible for guarding school sites&#13;
during construction and an inventory of school fixtures will be documented before the&#13;
contractor starts working, and the contractor will be responsible for these fixtures at the&#13;
time of final handover of the project; (iv) to mitigate the problem of inability of some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
contractors to work in certain areas in Iraq being from a different locality due to the&#13;
security conditions, a clause in the works bidding document would be added requesting&#13;
bidders to provide a methodology for accessing the school site and his ability to work;&#13;
and (v) a decree was issued in April 2004 by the Minister of Education to rectify the&#13;
shortcomings in the current procurement practice. In addition, an international&#13;
procurement consulting firm will be hired by the MOE to build MOE/DEOs capacities to:&#13;
carry out and manage procurement activities, to set up within the MOE and DEOs a&#13;
procurement monitoring and reporting system, assist the MOE-PMT in preparing bidding&#13;
documents and bid evaluation reports, carry out and build procurement capacity in the&#13;
MOE, consultants and consulting firms. The consulting firm will also be available to&#13;
respond to ad hoc requests for advice or training. Until security conditions in Iraq&#13;
improve, training workshops may take place outside the country (preferably in a&#13;
neighboring country). At least three workshops for all DEOs and MOE-PMT staff to&#13;
prepare bidding documents and bid evaluation reports will be organized as soon as&#13;
possible. An action plan will also be prepared by the MOE-PMT to train the DEO staff&#13;
on procurement.&#13;
Procurement Plan&#13;
44.   The MOE, at appraisal, developed a PP (Annex 3) for project implementation&#13;
which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan was agreed between the&#13;
MOE and the Bank project team on October 7, 2004, and is available at the MOE-PMT in&#13;
Baghdad. It will be available in the project's database and on the Bank's external website.&#13;
The PP will be updated in agreement with the Project Team as required to reflect the&#13;
actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
45.   In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices,&#13;
and based on the capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency, at least one&#13;
supervision mission is planned every three months to visit the field to carry out post&#13;
reviews of procurement. While security conditions prevent Bank presence in the country,&#13;
two firms employed as Monitoring Agents, and consultants, will help the Bank supervise&#13;
the project, including spot checks. In addition, the Bank will rely on reports from a local&#13;
procurement consultant that will work for the Bank from within Iraq. During the interim&#13;
period, Bank staff and the concerned Iraqi procurement staff will meet outside Iraq to do&#13;
off-site supervision as well as use of videoconference facilities.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
46.   The proposed grant of US$60.0 million will be disbursed over a period starting&#13;
November 1, 2004 and up to the closing date June 30, 2007. Annex 4 describes the&#13;
allocation of the grant proceeds according to each expenditure category.&#13;
47.   Grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the appropriate policies and&#13;
procedures of the World Bank. In emergency projects under OP 8.50, such as emergency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
postconflict situations where there is limited knowledge of country systems and often&#13;
limited access to review systems, the Bank accelerates project implementation by putting&#13;
in place mitigating financial controls often through a stand alone "ring fenced" Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU). The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to implement projects through&#13;
the Iraqi ministries (rather than a stand alone PIU), working together to strengthen the&#13;
Ministries controls, at the same time putting in place other measures to provide&#13;
assurance such two firms employed as Monitoring Agents, technical support and&#13;
supervision arrangements. As part of the compensating controls, disbursements will be&#13;
made primarily by direct payments by the Bank to the contractors, consultants and&#13;
vendors. Once authorized by the MOE, direct payments will be made by the World Bank&#13;
directly into the account of the contractor, consultant or vendor in a commercial bank&#13;
capable of receiving funds transferred from the international banking system. The&#13;
project management component and payments below the threshold of US$ 10,000 will be&#13;
made through payments by the Recipient from its own resources. These payments made&#13;
from the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed, on a periodical basis, by the&#13;
Bank to the MOE upon presentation of proof of payment and a signed withdrawal&#13;
application. The MOE-PMT and the main financial counterparts from the MOE will be&#13;
subject to intensive training in Bank disbursement procedures.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
48.   Financial Covenants. Bank policies require that grant proceeds are used only for&#13;
the purposes for which they were granted, with due regard to economy, efficiency, and the&#13;
sustainable achievement of the project's development objectives. In terms of this, MOE&#13;
is required to maintain an appropriate and adequate financial management system,&#13;
including records and accounts, and prepare financial statements adequate to separately&#13;
reflect the operations, resources, and expenditures. The Trust Fund Grant Agreement&#13;
also commits the Recipient to have the accounts, records, and financial statements of the&#13;
grant audited for each fiscal year by a qualified auditor acceptable to the Administrator.&#13;
49.   Risk Assessment Summary. Taking into consideration the Bank policy&#13;
mentioned in the previous paragraph, the financial management risk associated with this&#13;
operation is considered as high. Critical risk factors are: (i) limited knowledge in the&#13;
Bank about the Iraq government financial systems, controls, and procedures; (ii) limited&#13;
knowledge among the Iraqi authorities about the Bank and its policies and guidelines;&#13;
(iii) lack of a validation process for the schools selected under the project; (iv) the&#13;
distance between Baghdad and the school sites, which complicates information transfer&#13;
and confirmation of work done between the field and the paying entity; (v) the need for&#13;
validation of any variation order that may be identified during the implementation of the&#13;
work; (vi) variation order requests which may exhaust grant funds before all schools&#13;
scheduled for repair can be covered; (vii) difficulties with the evacuation of schools&#13;
where construction runs into the school year; (viii) problems in coordination of&#13;
implementation arrangements in the northern governorates; and (ix) the security&#13;
situation hampering on-site Bank work and financial or other assessments. The above&#13;
risks are partially mitigated through the project design while the remainder will require&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
close monitoring and supervision during project implementation. A detailed risk&#13;
assessment is included in Annex 4.&#13;
50.   Project Financial Management Arrangements. The project financial resources&#13;
will be managed within the framework of the Iraqi government systems. The grant funds&#13;
will be made available to the MOE who, assisted by the MOE-PMT, will enter into&#13;
contractual agreements with construction companies and contractors, consultants and&#13;
vendors for the rehabilitation and construction activities financed under the project.&#13;
51.   Due to the security risk, the project financial management assessment was&#13;
carried out in Amman by interviews with Iraqi officials from various ministries&#13;
including the MOE, the MOF, and the MOPDC. These interviews concentrated on: (i)&#13;
identifying the applicable procedures to introduce the grant proceeds as a supplement to&#13;
the MOE fiscal year 2004, 2005, and 2006 budgets and the procedures to be followed in&#13;
case the grant funds are not allocated within the ministry budget; and (ii) assessing the&#13;
current financial management practices at the MOE in order to identify the risks&#13;
associated with the control environment, the accounting, reporting and auditing&#13;
procedures in place and propose actions to reduce and manage such risks. Despite the&#13;
limited knowledge of the Recipient's systems and processes, this assessment showed&#13;
that the systems in place at MOE are based on principles and procedures defined by the&#13;
legal framework and operational decrees applicable to the public sector. The control&#13;
environment and accounting systems would however require strengthening and close&#13;
monitoring to be able to generate timely project reports for project management and&#13;
monitoring purposes.&#13;
52.   Accordingly, the control risks will be mitigated by putting in place additional&#13;
controls and procedures: (i) the MOE-PMT will verify and authorize payments under the&#13;
project; (ii) the MOE-PMT has assigned competent financial staff from the MOE who&#13;
will be supported, as needed, by financial management consultants; (iii) the MOE has&#13;
identified the champions from the MOE finance department, including the internal&#13;
auditor, who will track the project activities. This will ensure that the MOE team is well&#13;
informed about Bank guidelines and policies to follow on the project transactions and&#13;
provide support to the MOE-PMT; (iv) disbursements by the Bank will be made&#13;
primarily by direct payments supported by documentation; and (v) the Monitoring Agent&#13;
will review Project expenditures.&#13;
53.   The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple&#13;
parallel accounting system able to record all project expenditures and follow on the&#13;
project commitments at any moment during the implementation period and generate&#13;
project reporting including the Bank required Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).&#13;
54.   With respect to project auditing arrangements, an external independent auditor&#13;
with international experience will be engaged to perform the project audits and issue an&#13;
independent opinion on project financial statements. This external audit report will&#13;
encompass all project activities and will be in accordance with internationally accepted&#13;
auditing standards. The audit report along with the related financial statements should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
submitted to the Bank not later than two months after December 31, 2005, December 31,&#13;
2006 and following the closing date of the Grant.&#13;
55.   All the above activities and procedures will be documented within a chapter of&#13;
the P1M. The project Financial Management arrangements and identified risks are&#13;
detailed in Annex 4.&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
56.   Project activities should be completed by May 31, 2007. Supervision will include&#13;
visits to the MOE, MOF, MOPDC, and to school sites for the purpose of reviewing&#13;
implementation progress, impact of project activities, and related documentation.&#13;
57.   The MOE-PMT will prepare and send to the Bank a quarterly progress report.&#13;
The first report will be due by March 31, 2005. The format of the report has been agreed&#13;
during appraisal and will be included in the PIM.&#13;
58.   The Bank, as the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) Administrator, will supervise ITF-funded&#13;
operations in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. While staff&#13;
travel to Iraq is restricted, supervision of recipient-executed operations will be carried out&#13;
through two firms employed as Monitoring Agents and supervision consultants. Each&#13;
ITF-funded operation is required to include a results-based supervision plan that reflects&#13;
realities on the ground. A results-based supervision plan is attached as Annex 5.&#13;
59.   Reporting to Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger&#13;
accounts in respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF.&#13;
Within ninety (90) days of each March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, the&#13;
Bank will prepare, on a cash.basis, an unaudited statement of receipts, disbursements, and&#13;
fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor. Each such&#13;
statement will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency in which the ITF funds&#13;
will be maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred and eighty (180) days of&#13;
the completion of all disbursements relating to activities financed from the ITF, the Bank&#13;
will prepare on a cash basis an unaudited financial statement of receipts, disbursements,&#13;
and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
60.   The Bank will furnish the donors:&#13;
(a) on a semi-annual basis (starting February 2005), a consolidated report&#13;
describing the operations of the ITF (including contributions, disbursements,&#13;
and implementation progress) in the preceding six months; and&#13;
(b) on an annual basis (starting February 2005), a management assertion, together&#13;
with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy&#13;
of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for trust funds as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
61.   The Bank will require a financial statement audit of the ITF to be performed by&#13;
the Bank's external auditors on an annual basis. The costs of such an audit, including the&#13;
internal costs of the Bank with respect to such an audit, will be charged to the ITF. The&#13;
Bank will provide each donor with a copy of the auditors' report.&#13;
62.   The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the donors. The&#13;
Bank will provide each donor to the ITF with semi-annual reports on its quarterly ex-post&#13;
evaluation of the activities undertaken by the Monitoring Agents. Within six months of&#13;
completion of the activities, or of full disbursement of the contributions, whichever&#13;
comes later, the Bank will provide a final progress report to each donor, together with a&#13;
copy of the independent review of the performance of the Monitoring Agents. Upon&#13;
request by any donor, the Bank will send to such donor the draft and final reports&#13;
received by the Bank from the Monitoring Agents on the activities financed by the&#13;
contributions.&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
63.   Environmental Safeguards: The Project is rated category "B". Impacts would be&#13;
those associated mainly with (i) construction works (e.g. safety, dust, noise, pesticides,&#13;
waste material, traffic) (ii) provision of sanitary services, water supply and waste&#13;
management; and (iii) maintenance of facilities. Because of the emergency conditions,&#13;
the requirement to carry out limited Environmental Analysis as part of project preparation&#13;
will be waived but, for works with adverse environmental impacts, a limited&#13;
Environmental Analysis will be done during project implementation but before sub-&#13;
project approval. The Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework&#13;
(ESSAF) was disclosed in the country and in the Infoshop on April 26, 2004. Based on&#13;
the ESSAF, the following standards will be applied during implementation: (i) inclusion&#13;
of standard environmental codes of practice (ECOP) in the repair and reconstruction bid&#13;
documents of all sub-projects (Annex 6(i)); (ii) use of Safeguard Procedures for Inclusion&#13;
in the Technical Specifications of Contracts (Annex 6(ii); (iii) use of the Checklist of&#13;
likely Environmental and Social Impacts of Subproject (Attachment 2); (iv) review and&#13;
oversight of any major reconstruction works by specialists; (v) implementation of&#13;
environmentally and socially sound options for civil works; and (vi) provision for&#13;
adequate budget and satisfactory institutional arrangements to monitor effective&#13;
implementation and adequately maintain sanitary facilities after completion. Capacity&#13;
building on Safeguards and on the implementation of the ESSAF has already been&#13;
undertaken with the Ministry of Enviromnent and other line Ministries. During the MOE-&#13;
PMT Training mission in June 2004 special training on safeguards and on the ESSAF for&#13;
school rehabilitation was provided by a Safeguards Specialist.&#13;
64.   Resettlement and Land Acquisition: New construction will be limited only to&#13;
vacant sites that are on public property assigned by the relevant authorities for the use of&#13;
MOE. OP 4.12 is not expected to be triggered since neither displacement of populations&#13;
nor new land acquisition are planned. However, the Bank approved Environmental and&#13;
Social Screening and Assessment Framework, specifically elaborated for due diligence in&#13;
the case of Iraq, will be used to ensure that this is indeed the case and should there be any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
need for land acquisition or population resettlement, the same guidelines will be&#13;
followed.&#13;
65.   Selection of any new sites will require filing with the MOE-PMT documentary&#13;
evidence that (a) the site is on public land that has been assigned for sole use by the&#13;
MOE, and (b) the site is vacant and has no persons residing either legally or illegally. The&#13;
first three new reports have been reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
66.   Under the overall supervision of the MOE-PMT specialist who has been trained in&#13;
WB safeguards policies, site supervision by MOE engineering staff (or consultants where&#13;
capacity is lacking) will include checking on compliance of contractors with&#13;
environmental and social safeguards. Site supervision reports will include a section on&#13;
environmental and social safeguards which will be filed with the MOE-PMT. The first&#13;
three site supervision reports will be sent to the Bank for review.&#13;
E.    FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
67.   This project is prepared as part of the interim strategy of the World Bank in&#13;
addressing the pressing needs of the sector and according to the emergency recovery&#13;
assistance procedure (OP 8.50). The lack of reliable statistics, the limited economic&#13;
information, and the speed at which the project is prepared prevent more detailed&#13;
analysis, a familiar constraint in such operations. However, the benefits of the project's&#13;
investment are expected to be substantial compared to its costs as it addresses urgent&#13;
needs in an environment of devastated infrastructure, deteriorating quality, and escalating&#13;
needs. The project will support the construction of 117 school buildings and will create&#13;
42,000 spaces for primary and secondary students at an average cost of US$1,150 per&#13;
student space and will rehabilitate 144 schools with 45,700 students at an average cost of&#13;
US$181 per student. This will expand the capacity, reduce double and triple shift schools,&#13;
improve the conditions of learning, and enhance the quality of education.&#13;
68.   Recurrent costs of the project schools will be met from the MOE operational&#13;
budget. The MOE budget provides for furniture and equipment for the new school&#13;
buildings. Future maintenance costs of the new school buildings and the rehabilitated&#13;
schools will be a relatively small share of the overall MOE budget and do not constitute a&#13;
sustainability problem. However, the sustainability of maintenance costs of the 14,000&#13;
schools could become an issue during the medium term. But, the expected resumption of&#13;
oil exports in Iraq and the economic reform policies that are being introduced are&#13;
expected to stimulate sustainable growth over the medium term and provide resources for&#13;
such types of expenditure.&#13;
F.    RISKS&#13;
69.   This Project is being undertaken in an uncertain and highly risky environment.&#13;
The table below summarizes the key project risks identified, and indicates which&#13;
measures are being taken to mitigate these risks. The major risk for the project is the&#13;
inability of the MOE to complete rehabilitation activities on time because of security&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
issues, as highlighted below. The Environmental Category is B and therefore safeguard&#13;
measures have been put in place.&#13;

2.    Reference to Project Implementation Manual&#13;
The Project Management Team (MOE-PMT) will prepare a simple Project&#13;
Implementation Manual (PIM) by end-December 2004. The PIM will be adapted to&#13;
confonn to the Master Implementation Manual (MIM) when it is finalized. The MIM is&#13;
being prepared by an international consulting firm financed under the capacity building&#13;
trust fund for Iraq, and is planned to be finalized by November 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
3.     Any Other Special Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Not applicable&#13;
4.     Procurement Packages with Methods and Time Schedule&#13;
It is not expected that international contractors would be interested in the works contracts&#13;
under this project specially under the current security situation in Iraq and the scattering&#13;
of the locations of the subprojects. Thus no contract is expected to be procured using ICB&#13;
procedures. There is no domestic preference under the project. A detailed procurement&#13;
plan is attached.&#13;
III.   SELECTION OF CONSULTANTS&#13;
1.    Prior Review Threshold: Selection decisions subject to Prior Review by Bank as&#13;
stated in Appendix 1 to the Guidelines Selection and Employment of Consultants:&#13;
Selection Method        Prior Review Threshold        Comments&#13;
1. Services from firms or individuals  First three contracts regardless&#13;
of value.&#13;
1. Competitive Methods (Firms)  &gt;=US$100,000&#13;
2. Sinle Source Firms)         All&#13;
3. Individual Consultants      &gt;=US$50,000&#13;
4. Single Source (individual)  All&#13;
2.     Short list comprising entirely of national consultants&#13;
A short list of consultants for services, estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
per contract, may be comprised entirely of national consultants in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
3.    Any Other Special Selection Arrangements&#13;
The selection of a procurement consulting firm will be based on CQ. The volatile security&#13;
conditions in Iraq may not attract international consultants to work in Iraq. It is also&#13;
expected that international consulting firms may not be interested in the modification of&#13;
standard designs and supervision of school construction while the security situation is&#13;
volatile. Based on that, short lists for all consulting services for design and supervision of&#13;
school construction may be composed entirely of national consulting firms. It is also&#13;
expected that consulting offices associated with local universities may be included in the&#13;
short lists. University-based consultants shall not have preference over private&#13;
consultants.&#13;
4.     Consultancy Assignments with Selection Methods and Time Schedule&#13;
These are indicated in the attached procurement plan.&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
I.    Executive Summary and Conclusion&#13;
1.    Bank policies require that grant proceeds are used only for the purposes for which&#13;
they were granted, with due regard to economy, efficiency, and the sustainable&#13;
achievement of the project's development objectives. As an aspect of this requirement&#13;
the Recipient (MOE), among other things, is requested to maintain an appropriate and&#13;
adequate financial management system, including records and accounts, and prepare&#13;
financial statements adequate to separately reflect the operations, resources, and&#13;
expenditures. The Trust Fund Grant Agreement also commits the recipient to have the&#13;
accounts, records, and financial statements of the grant audited for each fiscal year by a&#13;
qualified auditor acceptable to the Administrator with scope and standards accepted&#13;
internationally.&#13;
2.    Due to the security risk, the project financial management assessment, was carried&#13;
out in Amman by interviewing Iraqi officials from various ministries including MOE,&#13;
MOF, and MOPDC. These interviews concentrated on: (i) identifying the applicable&#13;
procedures to introduce the grant proceeds as a supplement to the MOE FY05, FY06 and&#13;
FY07 budgets and how to proceed in case the grant funds are not allocated within the&#13;
ministry budget; and (ii) assessing the current financial management practices at the&#13;
MOE in order to identify the risks associated with the control environment, the&#13;
accounting, reporting and auditing procedures in place and propose actions to reduce and&#13;
manage such risks. Despite the limited knowledge of the Recipient's systems and&#13;
processes, this assessment showed that the systems in place at MOE are based on&#13;
principles and procedures defined by the legal framework and operational decrees&#13;
applicable to the public sector. The control environment and accounting systems would&#13;
however require strengthening and close monitoring to be able to generate timely project&#13;
reports for project management and monitoring purposes. Therefore, "ring-fencing"&#13;
accounting arrangements will be implemented by the MOE-PMT.&#13;
3.    Accordingly, the control risks will be mitigated by putting in place additional&#13;
controls and procedures including: (i) the MOE-PMT will verify and authorizing&#13;
payments under the project; (ii) the MOE-PMT will assign competent financial staff from&#13;
the MOE who will be supported, as needed, by expert financial management consultants;&#13;
(iii) the MOE will identify the champions (they have been identified) from the MOE&#13;
finance department, including the internal auditor, who will track the project activities.&#13;
This will allow for a well-informed team about Bank guidelines and policies from the&#13;
ministry to follow on the project transactions and provide support to the MOE-PMT; (iv)&#13;
disbursements by the Bank will be made primarily by direct payments supported by&#13;
documentation; and (v) the Monitoring Agent will review Project expenditures.&#13;
4     The accounting and reporting risks, will be managed by putting in place a simple&#13;
parallel accounting system able to record all project expenditures and follow on the&#13;
project commitments at any moment during the implementation period and generate&#13;
project reporting including the Bank required Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
project accounting system will be installed after the project is declared effective as the&#13;
grant funds will finance such system.&#13;
5     In addition, and as per grant agreement an external independent auditor with&#13;
international experience will be engaged to perform the project audits and issue an&#13;
independent opinion on the project financial statements.&#13;
6     All the above activities and procedures will be documented within a chapter of the&#13;
project operational manual.&#13;
II.   Identifled Project Risk&#13;
7     Taking into consideration the Bank policies and regulations, the financial&#13;
management risk associated with this operation is considered as high due to various&#13;
factors being: (i) the limited knowledge about the Iraq government financial systems,&#13;
controls, and procedures; (ii) the limited knowledge about the Bank and its policies and&#13;
guidelines by the Iraqi authorities; (iii) the lack of a validation process for the schools&#13;
selected under the project; (iv) the distance between Baghdad and the school sites thus&#13;
increasing the risk of information transfer and work delivered confirmation between the&#13;
field and the paying entity; (v) the validation of any variation order that may be&#13;
identified during the implementation of the work; (vi) variation order requests which&#13;
may consume the grant funds, financing 100% of the project activities, prior to&#13;
rehabilitating the planned total number of schools; (vii) possible disagreement on the&#13;
implementation arrangements for the rehabilitation of the schools in the northern&#13;
govemorate; and (viii) the security situation rendering the on-site Bank work and&#13;
assessments, financial or other, not possible. The above risks will be partially mitigated&#13;
during the project preparation while the residual will require close monitoring and&#13;
supervision during project implementation.&#13;
III.  MOE Project Arrangements&#13;
8.    All payments will be subject to the applicable controls, rules and regulations in&#13;
addition to the MOE-PMT verifications and approvals. These controls will be applied to&#13;
the grant transactions and payments even if the grant funds are disbursed from outside the&#13;
MOE budget. These controls, plus the engagement of an external independent auditor&#13;
with international experience, will be used to follow on the grant funds. the MOE will&#13;
post all signed contracts as commitments, while all verifications and controls will be&#13;
performed by the payable department, the MOE's internal audit unit, the Director General&#13;
or the Minister (depending on the payment value), and the MOE-PMT. The chart below&#13;

9.    Accounting System. To avoid the risk of the MOE not being able to generate&#13;
timely reports for project management and monitoring purposes, parallel arrangements&#13;
are being implemented to overcome this system shortcoming. The project accounting and&#13;
reporting activities will be undertaken by the MOE-PMT but in conjunction with MOE&#13;
control procedures and applicable laws. To that end, the MOE-PMT will seek the&#13;
services of a full time Financial Officer (identified) and an accountant. This financial&#13;
team within the MOE-PMT will coordinate closely with the MOE financial department&#13;
and will follow on the project accounts and the generation of projects report including the&#13;
Bank required FMRs. An accounting system needs to be installed at the MOE-PMT to&#13;
reduce the book keeping risk since the project will generate over the project life over 9203&#13;
financial transactions. This system should be able to follow on the project accounts and&#13;
generate the financial reports needed for monitoring and decision making. Until the&#13;
accounting system is installed at the MOE-PMT, spread sheet applications will be used to&#13;
record project transactions.&#13;
10.   Flow of Information. The rehabilitation of schools will take place in Baghdad&#13;
and the governorates. As per applicable laws all invoices, or BOQs, will be signed and&#13;
approved by the planning departments in the provinces and will be remitted to Baghdad&#13;
for payment under cover letter signed by the provincial Director General of Education.&#13;
11.   Manual of Financial Procedures. The project procedures and the parallel&#13;
accounting system that are managed by the MOE-PMT are not reflected in the MOE legal&#13;
framework. In order to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the parallel system data&#13;
and to define the relation between all departments involved with the project&#13;
implementation and thus facilitate the flow of project information, the MOE-PMT&#13;
financial officer, assisted by an external financial consultant, will prepare the Project&#13;
Financial Manual. This will be a chapter within the PIM, which integrates the applicable&#13;
laws and outlines the parallel system.&#13;
III.  Flow of Funds and Controls&#13;
12.   All invoices, either for advance payments or for actual incurred expenditures will&#13;
be subject to applicable controls and procedures in addition to the MOE-PMT verification&#13;
and approval. These invoices will be approved by the appropriate MOE departments and&#13;
will be honored through direct payment requests signed by the MOE authorized staff and&#13;
supported with copies of the invoices. With respect to the project management component&#13;
and payments below the threshold of US$ 10,000, they will be honored through payments&#13;
made available by the recipient of the grant financed from its own resources. However,&#13;
these payments made from the recipient own resources will be reimbursed, on periodical&#13;
basis, by the Bank to the MOE upon presentation of a proof of payment4 and a signed&#13;
withdrawal application.&#13;
3 As per the procurement plan 120 civil works and goods contracts are expected to be signed under the&#13;
project with an average of about 4 payments per contract, plus 440 transactions related to consultants and&#13;
PMT staff contracts.&#13;

IV.   Project reports&#13;
13.   Ouarterlv: The MOE will generate FMRs and submit them to the Bank as part of&#13;
the project progress report, or separately. These reports are made up of:&#13;
* Financial Reports: to include a cash flow statement, beginning and ending&#13;
project cash balances and an expenditure report by activity or contract comparing&#13;
actual and planned expenditures. Also, a narrative report explaining all variances&#13;
that exceed 15% when compared to plan and the proposed corrective actions&#13;
should be included as an annex to the financial reports.&#13;
* Contracts Reports: providing information on the major rehabilitation and&#13;
construction contracts, showing contract financial status against plan, including&#13;
information on all authorized contract variations.&#13;
These reports should be remitted to the Bank within 45 days from the end of the period.&#13;
The proposed format of the reports is in the project files and have been agreed upon with&#13;
the MOE representatives during appraisal.&#13;
14.   Annually:. Audited Project Financial Statements (PFS) will be submitted to the&#13;
Bank. PFS, will include:&#13;
(i)   Statement of sources and utilization of funds, indicating funds received and&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
(ii)  Appropriate schedules classifying project expenditures by activity and by&#13;
governorate, showing cumulative balances.&#13;
(iii)  Statement of payments made using SOEs procedures as defined in the legal&#13;
agreement.&#13;
V.    Auditing Arrangements&#13;
15.   An external independent auditor with international experience will be engaged to&#13;
perform the project audit and issue an independent opinion on the project financial&#13;
statements. The external audit report will encompass all of the Project's activities and will&#13;
be in accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards. MOE will remit a&#13;
project audit report to the Bank not later than two months after December 31, 2005,&#13;
December 31, 2006 and following the closing date of the Grant. The auditor selection&#13;
process will be launched directly after the grant agreement is signed. An Escrow account&#13;
will be used to pay the auditor after the project closing date. The audit report of the&#13;
project accounts shall include an opinion on the PFS and shall include a separate opinion&#13;
for the payments made using SOEs procedures. In addition to the audit reports, the&#13;
auditor will prepare a "management letter" identifying any observations, comments, and&#13;
deficiencies in the system and controls that the auditor considers pertinent, and will&#13;
provide recommendations for their improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VI.   Disbursement Arrangements and Associated Risk&#13;
16.   In emergency projects under OP 8.50, such as emergency postconflict situations&#13;
where there is limited knowledge of country systems and often limited access to review&#13;
systems, the Bank accelerates project implementation by putting in place mitigating&#13;
financial controls often through a stand alone "ring-fenced" PIUs. The Bank's strategy in&#13;
Iraq is to implement projects though the Iraqi ministries (rather than stand alone PIUs),&#13;
working together to strengthen the Ministries controls, at the same time putting in place&#13;
other measures to provide assurance such as two firms employed as Monitoring Agents,&#13;
technical support and supervision arrangements. As part of the compensating controls,&#13;
disbursements will be made by primarily by direct payments by the Bank to the&#13;
contractors, consultants and vendors. Direct payment applications will be prepared by the&#13;
MOE-PMT and submitted to the Bank through the MOE. Authorized signatories, names&#13;
and corresponding specimens of their signatures will also be submitted to the Bank.&#13;
17.   The project management component costs and payments below the threshold of&#13;
US$ 10,000 be honored through payments made available by the recipient of the grant&#13;
from its own resources. These payments made from the recipient's own resources will be&#13;
reimbursed, on periodical basis, by the Bank to the MOE upon presentation of a proof of&#13;
the payment and a signed withdrawal application. The MOE-PMT and the main financial&#13;
counterparts from MOE will be subject to intensive training in the Bank disbursement&#13;
procedures.&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
18.   It is expected that the grant will be disbursed by June 30, 2007. Managing the&#13;
project funds and all related financial transactions, including preparation and submission of&#13;
direct payment applications throughout the project, will be the responsibility of MOE&#13;
supported by the MOE-PMT. The allocation of grant proceeds by expenditure category are&#13;
as follows:&#13;
Amount of the&#13;
Grant Allocated              % of&#13;
Category                      (Expressed in            Expenditures&#13;

(1) Civil works                     52,800,000                 100%&#13;
(2) Goods                              400,000                 100%&#13;
(3) Consultants' services            2,900,000                 100%&#13;
(4) Training                           200,000                 100%&#13;
(5) Operating Costs                    500,000                 100%&#13;
(6) Unallocated                      3,200,000&#13;
Total                           60,000,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
Use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
19.    During implementation, SOEs will be used for all expenditures relating to: (a)&#13;
works and goods under contracts costing less than US$10,000 equivalent each; (b)&#13;
services under consultant firms contracts and individual consultant contracts costing less&#13;
than US$10,000 equivalent each; (c) roject operating cost; and (d) training, under such&#13;
terms and conditions as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. The supporting&#13;
documentation will be maintained by MOE and made available for review by Bank&#13;
representatives upon request; documentation relating to SOEs will be retained for up to&#13;
one year from the date the Bank receives the second grant audit report.&#13;

VIII. Bank Financial Management Supervision&#13;
21.    The first supervision mission after effectiveness will take the form of a training&#13;
workshop where further training on Bank rules, regulations and guidelines will be&#13;
presented. Supervision will intensify initially in order to ensure that the MOE-PMT and&#13;
the MOE finance champions are well-trained on Bank guidelines and procedures. While&#13;
security conditions prevent Bank presence in the country, two firms employed as&#13;
Monitoring Agents, and consultants, will help the Bank supervise the project.&#13;

15.    The Contractor shall ensure that site offices, depots and particularly storage areas for&#13;
diesel fuel and bitumen and asphalt plants are not located within 500 meters of watercourses, and&#13;
are operated so that no pollutants enter watercourses, either overland or through groundwater&#13;
seepage, especially during periods of rain. This will require lubricants to be recycled and a ditch&#13;
to be constructed around the area with an approved settling pond/oil trap at the outlet.&#13;
16.    The contractor shall not use fuelwood as a means of heating during the processing or&#13;
preparation of any materials forming part of the Works.&#13;
IV.    Quarries and Borrow Pits&#13;
17.    Operation of a new borrow area, on land, in a river, or in an existing area, shall be subject&#13;
to prior approval of the Engineer, and the operation shall cease if so instructed by the Engineer.&#13;
Borrow pits shall be prohibited where they might interfere with the natural or designed drainage&#13;
patterns. River locations shall be prohibited if they might undermine or damage the river banks,&#13;
or carry too much fine material downstream.&#13;
18.    The Contractor shall ensure that all borrow pits used are left in a trim and tidy condition&#13;
with stable side slopes, and are drained ensuring that no stagnant water bodies are created which&#13;
could breed mosquitoes.&#13;
19.    Rock or gravel taken from a river shall be far enough removed to limit the depth of&#13;
material removed to one-tenth of the width of the river at any one location, and not to disrupt the&#13;
river flow, or damage or undermine the river banks.&#13;
20.    The location of crushing plants shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer, and not&#13;
be close to environmentally sensitive areas or to existing residential settlements, and shall be&#13;
operated with approved fitted dust control devices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
V.     Earthworks&#13;
21.    Earthworks shall be properly controlled, especially during the rainy season.&#13;
22.    The Contractor shall maintain stable cut and fill slopes at all times and cause the least&#13;
possible disturbance to areas outside the prescribed limits of the work.&#13;
23.    The Contractor shall complete cut and fill operations to final cross-sections at any one&#13;
location as soon as possible and preferably in one continuous operation to avoid partially&#13;
completed earthworks, especially during the rainy season.&#13;
24.    In order to protect any cut or fill slopes from erosion, in accordance with the drawings,&#13;
cut off drains and toe-drains shall be provided at the top and bottom of slopes and be planted with&#13;
grass or other plant cover. Cut off drains should be provided above high cuts to minimize water&#13;
runoff and slope erosion.&#13;
25.    Any excavated cut or unsuitable material shall be disposed of in designated tipping areas&#13;
as agreed to by the Engineer.&#13;
26.    Tips should not be located where they can cause future slides, interfere with agricultural&#13;
land or any other properties, or cause soil from the dump to be washed into any watercourse.&#13;
Drains may need to be dug within and around the tips, as directed by the Engineer.&#13;
VI.    Historical and Archeological Sites&#13;
27.    If the Contractor discovers archeological sites, historical sites, remains and objects,&#13;
including graveyards and/or individual graves during excavation or construction, the Contractor&#13;
shall:&#13;
Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find.&#13;
Delineate the discovered site or area.&#13;
Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects. In cases of removable&#13;
antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the responsible local&#13;
authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over.&#13;
Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local authorities and the&#13;
Ministry of Culture immediately (less than 24 hours).&#13;
Contact the responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture who would be in charge of&#13;
protecting and preserving the site before deciding on the proper procedures to be carried out.&#13;
This would require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be performed by the archeologists&#13;
of the Ministry of Culture (within 72 hours). The significance and importance of the findings&#13;
should be assessed according to the various criteria relevant to cultural heritage, including the&#13;
aesthetic, historic, scientific or research, social and economic values.&#13;
Ensure that decisions on how to handle the finding be taken by the responsible authorities and the&#13;
Ministry of Culture. This could include changes in the layout (such as when the finding is an&#13;
irre!movable remain of cultural or archeological importance) conservation, preservation,&#13;
restGration and salvage.&#13;
Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding shall be&#13;
communicated in writing by the Ministry of Culture; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
Construction work will resume only after authorization is given by the responsible local&#13;
authorities and the Ministry of Culture concerning the safeguard of the heritage.&#13;
VII.   Disposal of Construction and Vehicle Waste&#13;
28.    Debris generated due to the dismantling of the existing structures shall be suitably reused,&#13;
to the extent feasible, in the proposed construction (e.g. as fill materials for embankments). The&#13;
disposal of remaining debris shall be carried out only at sites identified and approved by the&#13;
project engineer. The contractor should ensure that these sites (a) are not located within&#13;
designated forest areas; (b) do not impact natural drainage courses; and (c) do not impact&#13;
endangered/rare flora. Under no circumstances shall the contractor dispose of any material in&#13;
environmentally sensitive areas.&#13;
29.    In the event any debris or silt from the sites is deposited on adjacent land, the Contractor&#13;
shall immediately remove such, debris or silt and restore the affected area to its original state to&#13;
the satisfaction of the Supervisor/Engineer.&#13;
30.    Bentonite slurry or similar debris generated from pile driving or other construction&#13;
activities shall be disposed of to avoid overflow into the surface water bodies or form mud&#13;
puddles in the area.&#13;
31.    All arrangements for transportation  during  construction  including  provision,&#13;
maintenance, dismantling and clearing debris, where necessary, will be considered incidental to&#13;
the work and should be planned and implemented by the contractor as approved and directed by&#13;
the Engineer.&#13;
32.    Vehicle/machinery and equipment operations, maintenance and refueling shall be carried&#13;
out to avoid spillage of fuels and lubricants and ground contamination. An 'oil interceptor" will be&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Iraq Emergency School Construction
            and Rehabilitation Project aims to improve conditions of
            learning in primary and secondary schools by constructing
            new buildings for schools that exist in unsafe or shared
            facilities, and by rehabilitating schools needing urgent
            repair, most of which are in the Baghdad governorate. There
            are two main project components. Component 1 finances new
            buildings for 110 primary and secondary schools and repairs
            140 schools. Component 2 funds project management and
            capacity building. The grant cover most of the staff's
            salaries, finances equipment, vehicles, furniture, and
            operating costs, including equipment maintenance,
            transportation and travel, rental of office space, office
            supplies and office administration, fuel costs,
            communication costs, cost for producing bidding documents,
            commercial bank charges, etc.
