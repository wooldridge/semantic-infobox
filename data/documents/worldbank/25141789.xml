     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     On June 7, 2011, the Government of Nepal received a competitive grant of $46.5 million from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) to implement&#13;
     the Agriculture and Food Security Project (AFSP). The World Bank is the administrator for GAFSP as well as the supervising entity for AFSP, which is the first project&#13;
     in Nepal that brings together two ministries -- agriculture and health -- to increase agricultural productivity and improve access to and utilization of nutritious food.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The goal is to enhance food and nutritional security of targeted communities in selected locations of Nepal. Key expected outcomes of the project are: (i) increased&#13;
     productivity of targeted crops and livestock products: and (ii) access to and utilization of nutritious food to nutritionally vulnerable groups (pregnant and nursing&#13;
     mothers, and children between six and 24 months old). The project comprises three components: (i) technology development and adaptation; (ii) technology&#13;
     dissemination and adoption; and (iii) food and nutritional status enhancement. It aims to reach 162,500 beneficiaries, including 45,000 pregnant and nursing&#13;
     women.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     The project has made considerable progress, including: (i) release of eight promising crop varieties and six improved technologies for rice, wheat, maize, potato, lentil,&#13;
     soybean and buckwheat; (ii) production of 8.3 metric tons of breeder seeds and 49.9 metric tons of source seeds; (iii) importation of 129 improved goats from Australia&#13;
     and the United States for breed improvement; (iv) establishment of 438 farmer field schools; (v) formation of 710 livestock farmer groups, of which 91 percent are&#13;
     female; and (vi) initiation of a nutrition improvement program through behavior change communication and establishment of nutrition-based vegetable gardens.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Two-thirds of Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s population is engaged in the agriculture sector, which contributes 36 percent towards the nationâ&#128;&#153;s total GDP. With only about 28 percent of&#13;
the total agricultural land under year-round irrigation, there is a scope for both expanding the area under irrigation and improving water delivery and management&#13;
efficiency. The recently developed Agriculture Development Strategy, funded under a multi-donor initiative (including the Bank), also emphasizes the need for&#13;
irrigated agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The Irrigation and Water Resources Management Project (IWRMP) aims to improve agriculture productivity and the management of selected irrigation schemes and to&#13;
enhance institutional capacity for integrated water resources management. It aims to ensure efficient integration of water resources and crop production to derive full&#13;
benefits from investments in irrigation. The project has four main components: (i) irrigation infrastructure development and improvement; (ii) irrigation management&#13;
transfer to water user associations in the Tarai (plains); (iii) institutional and policy support for integrated water resources management; and (iv) integrated crop and&#13;
water management.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
IWRMPâ&#128;&#153;s first phase ended in June 2014 and in December 2013, the project secured an additional financing of $50 million to complete the outstanding schemes&#13;
and scale up the best practices achieved. Productivity of key agricultural crops has increased in a range of 25 percent to 45 percent, with corresponding increase in&#13;
cropping intensity. Thirty-two stations of Babai, West Rapti and Karnali River Basin have been equipped with telemetry system â&#128;&#147; nine are hydrological stations and 23&#13;
are meteorological stations. Through the IWRMP, 114 farmer-managed irrigation schemes have been rehabilitated, management transfers covering an area of 23,100&#13;
hectares. Through improved technology and reliable availability of water, productivity of rice, wheat, maize, and potato have increased by 52, 53, 53 and 51 percent,&#13;
respectively. Cropping intensity has increased from a baseline of 168 percent to 220 percent. Following the earthquake of April 2015, IWRMP underwent restructuring&#13;
to extend the closing date by one year for the parent project which has made available $2 million to support recovery activities.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s mountainous landscape and infrastructure gaps have weakened linkages in the food value chain, exacerbating the challenges in agricultural growth and&#13;
     food security. Its entry into the World Trade Organization presents new opportunities for market integration provided the competitiveness of the agriculture sector can&#13;
     be significantly enhanced. It is strengthening emerging commodity value chains, and providing local and international access to markets by forging backward and&#13;
     forward linkages in selected value chains.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The project aims to improve the competitiveness of project-supported smallholder farmers and agribusiness within selected commodity value chains. This is to be&#13;
     achieved by: (i) agriculture and rural business development through provision of matching grants to commodity value-chain actors mainly for technology support and&#13;
     agribusiness development; (ii) support for sanitary and phyto-sanitary facilities to regulate and maintain food quality; and (iii) project management.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     PACT has so far supported over 223 cooperatives, 140 farmer groups, 145 private firms and nine producer associations, reaching out to 65,386 direct beneficiaries, of&#13;
     which over 42 percent are women. The three new windows supporting medium and micro enterprises (for rural districts and Integrated Pest Management) are under&#13;
     implementation, and are expected to reach out to smallholders and micro enterprises as well as different actors of a single value chain to strengthen backward and&#13;
     forward linkages. These activities are further being supported through establishment of the Agribusiness Innovation Center, construction and rehabilitation of central&#13;
     and regional markets, laboratory equipment, and training support to the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, Department of Livestock Services and&#13;
     Department of Agriculture (DoA).&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
The Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) was established around nine years ago, operating in six pilot districts. To date, PAF has successfully reached out to vulnerable&#13;
groups â&#128;&#147; especially those disadvantaged due to gender, caste, ethnicity or physical isolation â&#128;&#147; in 55 districts. PAF also has demonstrated significant commitment to&#13;
the strengthening of community organizations (COs) and their capacity to manage finances and activities, including creation of networks and cooperatives to support&#13;
marketing and production of products.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The project aims to improve living conditions, livelihoods, and empowerment among the rural poor, with particular attention to groups that have traditionally been&#13;
excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste, and location. The project has four main components: (i) small-scale community infrastructure to provide capacity-&#13;
building support and sub-grants to community organizations for local infrastructure projects (ii) sustainable income generation to provide capacity-building support&#13;
and sub-grants to community organizations for income-generation activities; (iii) product development, market linkages, and pilots to support those community&#13;
organizations that are more advanced; and (iv) capacity-building and institutional strengthening to support the formation and development of community&#13;
organizations and the creation of cooperatives and market alliances.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:	&#13;
PAF is now operating its regular program in 55 districts and has made agreements with 25,139 Community Organizations. The project has so far directly benefitted&#13;
716,385 households and has indirectly benefitted an additional 50,663 households (through PAF-financed infrastructure sub-projects), of which 64 percent fall&#13;
under the category of ultra-poor (food sufficiency less than three months). CO-member households are 25 percent Dalit, 27 percent Janajati, 3 percent Muslim, 29&#13;
percent Brahmin/Chhetri, and 16 percent other ethnicity. About 74 percent of CO members are female. Out of 31 major districts greatly affected by the April and May&#13;
earthquakes, PAF covers 14, seven of which are â&#128;&#156;major crisis hitâ&#128;&#157; as per the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment. PAF intends to provide support to these districts through&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation, income generation, and skills development. For this purpose approximately $11 million ($8 million from IDA and $3 million from the&#13;
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has been set aside, and a concept note with a detailed implementation arrangement and budget is being&#13;
prepared.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     The Rani Jamara Kulariya Scheme (the Rani Scheme) is one of the most prominent farmer-managed irrigation schemes in Nepal, with a cultivable command area&#13;
     of 14,300 hectares (the project area), of which about 11,000 hectares are currently being irrigated. It is located in the Tarai area of Kailali District in the Far Western&#13;
     Development Region, one of the least developed in the country. Bank support is proposed in two phases. The first, currently under implementation, mainly focuses on&#13;
     modernization of the higher-order irrigation infrastructure (especially intakes and feeder and branch canals), as well as the preparation and initiation of an agricultural&#13;
     development program. The proposed second phase would mainly focus on the modernization of the lower-order irrigation infrastructure (sub-branch and tertiary&#13;
     canals and water courses) and implementation of a comprehensive agricultural improvement program.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The objective is to improve irrigation water delivery and management in the project area by improving performance of the irrigation systems and strengthening&#13;
     community-based irrigation management. These activities seek to build resilience through more efficient water delivery and management against water-induced&#13;
     hazards such as droughts, floods, and changes in water availability during the agricultural seasons. The project also supports the agricultural development that will&#13;
     result in a modest increase in yields, especially in the upper part of the command area. The project comprises four components: (i) scheme modernization; (ii)&#13;
     strengthening Water Users Associations; (iii) agricultural production support; and (iv) project management.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     The feeder canal connecting the three main branch canals is substantially completed, with earthworks and most structures finished. The main work on the three branch&#13;
     canals is the construction of 23 large hydraulic-control structures. Six of them have been completed; seven are under construction. The construction of the remaining&#13;
     ones will start in October 2015 after the monsoon season. The completed structures were tested and the initial results show that all structures are functioning as per&#13;
     design. About 60 kilometers (km) of the 82-km road improvement is completed and out of the planned 10 bridges, five are completed and bringing improved access&#13;
     to the scheme areas. About 9.5 km of river training works have been completed and training works for about 8.8 km is ongoing and will mostly be completed by the&#13;
     end of 2015. The completed river training works have performed well and were able to contain serious flooding in the Karnali River. Agricultural activities, such as&#13;
     demonstrations and farmers field schools, are starting to show results and many farmers are already reporting modest yield increases.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Nepal is prone to a range of hydro-meteorological (hydromet) hazards such as floods and droughts, the frequency and intensity of which are expected to increase&#13;
with climate change. The poorer sections of the country are typically the worst affected and have the least capacity to deal with such risks. A well-functioning hydromet&#13;
network, forecasting and early warning system is crucial for strengthening resilience to such risks. The existing network is mainly manual, with limited real-time data&#13;
collection, transmission and storage, and there is no system for issuing authoritative warnings for weather-related disasters to government authorities, key user groups,&#13;
or communities at risk. Improved agro- meteorological information is also an urgent priority for the agricultural sector. The Building Resilience to Climate-Related&#13;
Hazards Project is one of four projects financed through the Nepal Pilot Program for Climate Resilience under the Strategic Climate Fund. Implementation of this&#13;
project is supported by the World Bank. Other development partners participating in the Nepal PPCR program include the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the IFC.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s main objective is to enhance government capacity to mitigate climate-related hazards by improving the accuracy and timeliness of weather and flood&#13;
forecasts and warnings for climate-vulnerable communities, and to support development of agricultural management information system services to help farmers&#13;
mitigate climate-related production risks. The project has four components: (i) institutional capacity strengthening of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology&#13;
(DHM); (ii) modernization of hydro-meteorological observation networks and forecasting; (iii) enhancement of DHMâ&#128;&#153;s service delivery system; and (iv) creation of an&#13;
agriculture management information system anchored at the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MOAD).&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
DHM, under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, has contracted a system integrator firm to design and prepare bidding documents for modernization&#13;
of its observation network, forecasting, and services. Draft design documents have been prepared and are being finalized. Priority bidding documents for upgrading&#13;
the countryâ&#128;&#153;s meteorological and hydrological networks and installation of radar are under preparation. The demolition of DHMâ&#128;&#153;s building is in progress. Design of&#13;
the proposed new building and bidding documents are being finalized. DHM is issuing various consultancies, which are at different stages of procurement. MOAD, in&#13;
collaboration with the Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC), has started to prepare basic agro-advisory bulletins and is piloting them at the district level. A good&#13;
practice example of inter-institutional collaboration is the formation of JOWGRAM -- a joint working group between DHM, MOAD and NARC -- to exchange data and&#13;
information, and facilitate preparation of agro-weather advisories and products that can be distributed to farmers. Various training activities have been undertaken&#13;
by DHM and MOAD at the national and district levels. MOAD has also undertaken several study tours in FY2015 to Kenya, India and the United States to learn from&#13;
international experience on development of agricultural management information systems and outreach to farmers.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     The credit is the second in a series of three Development Policy Credits. The first credit (DPC1) was a stand-alone single-tranche $30 million SDR equivalent credit&#13;
     approved by the IDAâ&#128;&#153;s Board in June 2013. The second and third DPCs are two programmatic single-tranche development policy operations that support the reform&#13;
     program of the Government of Nepal (GON) to address financial sector vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The development objectives of the proposed credit are to support the financial sector medium-term reform program initiated by the Nepalese authorities to reduce&#13;
     the vulnerability of the banking sector and increase its transparency. Although this operation was designed prior to the April 2015 earthquake, the magnitude of&#13;
     the devastation that ensued, as well as the heightened vulnerabilities of the financial sector as a result of the disaster, have resulted in an additional objective. That&#13;
     objective is to provide the GON with much-needed short-term financial support to expedite and scale up relief and recovery efforts while mitigating new emerging&#13;
     financial-sector weaknesses and allowing it to play its role in the broader post-disaster recovery effort. The proposed credit is composed of four policy areas: (i) enhancing&#13;
     financial-sector development and restructuring, and consolidating the financial system; (ii) strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for crisis management;&#13;
     (iii) improving banking supervision and payment systems; and (iv) enhancing the governance and transparency of the banking system. The second and third areas in&#13;
     particular assume special significance in the aftermath of the earthquake.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS EXPECTED (AT THE END OF THE DPC SERIES IN JUNE 2017)&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      A strengthened coordination framework for design and implementation of financial-sector reforms is established.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The restructured and recapitalized Rastriya Banijya Bank and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) meet all regulatory norms (including Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) &gt;10&#13;
            percent) and state control of NBL has been divested.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The banking system has been stabilized and consolidated with all banks being either CAR-compliant or in prompt corrective action programs, and the number of&#13;
            financial institutions has been reduced to fewer than 130.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The legal framework for bank supervision, regulation, and financial crisis management has been strengthened by the enactment of amendments to the Nepal&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
With a growing youth population and a rising number of people entering the labor force, the Government of Nepal is implementing various programs to improve access&#13;
to technical and vocational education and training (TVET) for the poor and disadvantaged youth. This first IDA TVET project in Nepal contributes to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
efforts by reaching out to more than 75,000 youths who will get access to short-term skills training, technical education, opportunities for certifying their existing&#13;
skills, and other inclusive processes. The project also supports quality enhancement of institutions offering Technical School Leaving Certificate and Diploma programs&#13;
through the provision of matching and performance grants. Initial delays in the commencement of key activities in the first two years led to restructuring of the project&#13;
in December 2013, with partial cancellation of funds amounting to $10.5 million. The project has now achieved or exceeded all of its key performance indicator targets,&#13;
and GON has requested an extension of the project closing date to continue support for skills training in great demand by youths and contribute to the post-earthquake&#13;
reconstruction activities. The request has been endorsed by the World Bank, and the project is currently being restructured to extend its closing date to June 30, 2017.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s goal is to expand the supply of skilled and employable labor by increasing access to quality training programs, and by strengthening the technical and&#13;
vocational education and training system in Nepal. It consists of four components: (i) strengthening technical education and vocational training regulatory activities&#13;
and capacity building; (ii) strengthening technical education; (iii) supporting short-term training and recognition of prior learning; and (iv) project management and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. The project is providing short-term training, stipends to students for technical education, and performance-based grants and/or matching&#13;
grants to technical institutes. It also has provisions for certifying existing skills gained through informal methods, and for creating a larger pool of trainers in the country.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      About 73.5 percent of graduates from supported programs have been gainfully employed for at least six months after the completion of training.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      More than 12,470 youths have been tested and certified on pre-existing skills by the National Skills Testing Board.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The share of girls, Dalits and disadvantaged Janjatis enrolled in supported institutions has increased to 58.1 percent.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      A total of 409 skills test managers, 1,707 lead and assistant trainers, and 5,104 skills test assessors have been trained.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Around 4,070 students, selected using a means-testing method, have received or are receiving scholarship support, and around 55,000 youths have received&#13;
       short-term training through results-based and voucher-based modalities. This includes a special window for providing short-term skills training exclusively to&#13;
       women in non-traditional trades.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Higher education in Nepal is provided by nine universities and four health academies governed by separate acts. The Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry&#13;
     of Health and Population (MOHP) are the focal ministries for universities and health institutions. Higher education enrollment has been on the rise, with an average&#13;
     annual growth rate of 14.7 percent. The gross enrollment rate in higher education increased from 7 percent to 17.1 percent from 2005/06 to 2012/13, an increase&#13;
     higher than that of most countries at comparable levels of economic development. Despite significant achievements over the past decade, weak relevance, low quality,&#13;
     internal inefficiency, inequity, and inadequate financing continue to pose major challenges in the higher education sector. IDA has been a key partner supporting&#13;
     higher education through other projects in the past as well. One of the main goals of the GONâ&#128;&#153;s Approach Paper to the Thirteenth Plan (2013-16) is to achieve job-&#13;
     centered, poverty-reducing, sustainable, and broad-based economic growth. Human resources and skills development is a priority sector highlighted for Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     economic growth and development. The project supports government programs to help develop the required human resources and add to the national knowledge&#13;
     base.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The project development objective is to support reforms in selected institutions for improving quality, relevance, and efficiency of higher education, and to assist&#13;
     under-privileged students with equitable access. The project comprises two components. The first component, implementation of reforms, uses a results-based&#13;
     Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLI) approach to finance four result areas,. Component two uses normal Investment Project Financing (IPF) mode to finance costs&#13;
     associated with project management and capacity building. Results Area 1: Systemic and Institutional Reforms includes major reforms for: (i) more effective public&#13;
     funding; (ii) institutionalization of the national accreditation system; (iii) greater institutional autonomy; and (iv) strengthening of the examination system. Results&#13;
     Area 2: Academic Reforms and Relevance, focuses on: (i) better learning outcomes in all programs; and (ii) introduction/expansion of programs in market-relevant&#13;
     and priority areas of development for Nepal. Results Area 3: Equity supports meritorious students belonging to the two poorest quintiles selected through nationwide&#13;
     Proxy Means Testing approach. Results Area 4: Academic Excellence and Research supports the government in financing research, development, and innovation.&#13;
     Component 2 supports effective implementation and monitoring. It finances inputs and activities required to achieve the above-stated results and enhance the&#13;
     capacity of the implementing, coordinating, and participating agencies, including in conducting various surveys and studies.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     The following results (DLIs) have been achieved as of July 31, 2015: Guidelines for: (i) performance based funding of higher education institutions funded through&#13;
     the Higher Education Reform Project; (ii) formula based funding of regular grants for community campuses; and (iii) formula based funding for universities and&#13;
     autonomous campuses funded from regular grants have been endorsed by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Tribhuvan University (TU) has adopted (i) revised&#13;
     autonomy campus rules for constituent campuses; and (ii) rules for academic autonomy for constituent and affiliated campuses. TU has also adopted: (i) revised&#13;
     academic rules for ensuring completion of academic calendar within one year; and (ii) a plan for examination reform (with special focus on centralized examinations).&#13;
     Areas of priority for new programs and the criteria and procedures for selection of programs and institutions have been approved by UGC. Proxy Means Testing (PMT)&#13;
     processes for selection of students are revised by the Student Financial Assistance Fund Development Board (SFAFDB) and database and process is computerized; and&#13;
     UGC has: (i) revised the existing guidelines for research funding; and (ii) identified priority areas for research support. TU has adopted the parallel recruitment and&#13;
     promotion rules.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
The School Sector Reform Program (SSRP) is a government initiative that aims to enhance access to and improve the quality of education. It covers Grades 1â&#128;&#147;12 as well&#13;
as early childhood education and development and non-formal education. SSRP focuses on basic education to achieve the education Millennium Development Goals&#13;
(MDGs) by 2015. It is being implemented through a sector-wide approach, with financial contributions from the government and 14 development partners, including&#13;
the World Bank. The original IDA financing ($130 million) was for five years (2009-2014). In addition, the program received a grant of $120 million, administered&#13;
by the Bank, from the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Trust Fund (now known as the Global Partnership for Educationâ&#128;&#148;GPE) in 2010. This TF closed on&#13;
December 15, 2014. In June 2013, the board approved $100 million in additional IDA financing along with an extension of the project closing date to July 15, 2016.&#13;
Another $63.3 million is in pipeline through a combination of grants from two trust funds: GPE and Result for all Children.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The project aims to support the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s SSRP to increase access to and improve quality of school education, especially for marginalized groups. The three&#13;
main components of the program focus on: (i) basic education (Grades 1-8); (ii) secondary education (Grades 9-12); and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity. The&#13;
program finances both the recurrent and the development expenditures for school education, focusing on the SSRPâ&#128;&#153;s three pillars of enhancing access, promoting&#13;
inclusion, and improving quality. The key policy reforms supported include increased community management of schools, public private partnership for improved&#13;
delivery of textbooks, and improved learning outcomes through establishment of a standardized student assessment system.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
Nepal has made remarkable progress in enhancing access to basic school education. Starting from a baseline of 73 percent, the net enrollment rate for basic education&#13;
has increased to 87.60 percent, surpassing the end of program target of 85 percent. The completion rate for basic education has reached 66.7 percent. Nepal has&#13;
achieved gender parity in net enrollment for both basic and secondary education. The assessments of student learning outcomes for grades 3, 5 and 8 have been&#13;
completed and the final reports are publicly available. An equity strategy has been developed and will be implemented before the end of the current fiscal year.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     The project supports the government strategy to deal with the current crisis in the energy sector. To fight the energy crisis, generation capacity has to be increased and&#13;
     system loss should be reduced. Currently, the system loss of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) stands at 26.3 percent, incorporating both technical and commercial&#13;
     (non-technical) losses. Many activities have been carried out to reduce the system losses, such as conductor upgrade work for 132 kilovolt (kV) cross-border transmission&#13;
     line and capacitor banks installation in some substations. However, the distribution system needs to be rehabilitated to further reduce the technical losses. The non-&#13;
     technical losses, such as leakages, are also deemed high. NEA is trying to engage an ambitious program of expanding access to and improving the quality of electricity&#13;
     service. A key aspect of this program is to curtail power system losses to acceptable levels.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The project development objectives are to: (i) increase solar photovoltaic generated electricity to supply to the NEA grid; and (ii) reduce NEAâ&#128;&#153;s distribution losses in&#13;
     selected distribution centers. The project has two components. Component 1: (Grid-connected Solar Photovoltaic Farms Development) This component will support: (i)&#13;
     design, supply, construction, commissioning, and operation and maintenance of grid-connected solar farms to supply electricity directly to NEAâ&#128;&#153;s distribution network;&#13;
     (ii) provision of technical advisory services to assist NEA with, among other things, the procurement and supervision of the engineering, procurement, and construction&#13;
     contract for the solar farms; and (iii) provision of capacity-building activities to assist NEA with, among other things, independent bid evaluation, project management,&#13;
     contract execution, and operation and maintenance of the solar farms. Component 2: (Distribution System Planning and Loss Reduction) This component will support:&#13;
     (i) preparation of a distribution master plan; (ii) preparation of a system loss reduction master plan; (iii) carrying out a set of activities in system-loss reduction in&#13;
     selected NEAâ&#128;&#153;s distribution centers. Those include: (i) replacing conductors of distribution feeders or building distributions lines to reduce line losses; (ii) adding or&#13;
     replacing distribution transformers to maintain voltage levels and reduce transformer losses; and (iii) adding capacitor banks to compensate reactive power to manage&#13;
     voltage levels; and (iv) building the capacity of NEA in distribution system planning and management. That latter aspect includes provision of equipment, software,&#13;
     and training for distribution system loss identification and reduction planning, and development of a geographic information system database.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     IDA financing has not been made effective because the ownerâ&#128;&#153;s engineer has not yet been hired, and that is a condition for moving forward. Currently, there is a short&#13;
     list of candidates. International competitive bidding for an engineering, procurement and construction contract for design, supply, installation and initial operation of&#13;
     a 25-megawatt (MW) grid-connected solar farm (estimated cost of $50 million) was advertised on April 13, 2015. The bid submission date was extended from June 11,&#13;
     2015 to August 31, 2015 upon request of bidders. Terms of reference (TOR) for the loss-reduction master plan was prepared by the counterparts and is under review&#13;
     by Bank team.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
While Nepal is endowed with a huge theoretical hydropower potential of about 84,000 MW and economically viable potential of 43,000 MW, the installed hydropower&#13;
generation capacity as of July 2013 was merely 746 MW. Similarly, 75 percent of the population of Nepal is estimated to have access to electricity (grid and off-&#13;
grid) according to the 2013 Census, however, service is not necessarily available due to shortage of supply, with load shedding of up to 18 hours per day in grid-&#13;
covered areas in the dry season. The World Bank Group, ADB, DfID and other development partners are jointly working on a transformational hydropower engagement&#13;
program to develop Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s hydropower potential to meet the countryâ&#128;&#153;s immediate power needs and to export to enhance growth and regional integration. The&#13;
current (KAHEP) project -- 37.6 MW, jointly financed by IDA and IFC including IFCâ&#128;&#147;Canada Climate Change Program (CCCP) with a local sponsor group -- would&#13;
demonstrate development of hydropower through a PPP. KAHEP is consistent with the joint IDA/IFC Country Partnership Strategy for Nepal (FY2014-16), which stresses&#13;
the importance of increased supply of electricity and improved access to reliable and affordable electricity to increasing economic growth and competitiveness. It is&#13;
also consistent with the government strategy to deal with the current energy crisis and to attract private investments in hydropower. If successful, the project will&#13;
demonstrate the viability of future hydropower projects through proper PPP arrangements and attract investors to the country and the sector.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The project development objective is to add hydropower generation capacity to supply the NEA grid through public private investments. KAHEP has three components:&#13;
(i) the KAHEP component ($102.6) with IDA, IFC and CCCP funding in credit terms to construct the hydropower project including a diversion dam, intake, settling&#13;
basins, a headrace tunnel, a semi-underground powerhouse and a tailrace canal; (ii) the MOE component ($2 million), with IDA funding in grant terms to support&#13;
implementation and compliance; and (iii) the Investment Board Nepal (IBN) component ($4 million), with IDA funding in grant terms.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
The negotiated financing agreement as well as project agreement have been signed, but not yet made effective since the following have not yet been achieved: (i)&#13;
signing of subsidiary agreements (SAs) between the MOF and HIDCL and between HIDCL and KEL; (ii) signing of a power purchase agreement (PPA) between NEA&#13;
and KEL. The new deadline for effectiveness is October 31, 2015. Negotiations on the PPA have been concluded and the negotiated PPA has been submitted to the&#13;
NEA board for approval. Negotiations on the SA between HIDCL and KEL are underway and signing of both SAs was expected by September 21, 2015. Bidding for the&#13;
two packages of the KAHEPâ&#128;&#148;civil works and equipmentâ&#128;&#148;have been concluded and signing of contracts are pending for effectiveness of IDA financing. Construction&#13;
schedules have been agreed with potential winning bidders for a 38-month contractual construction period. For the IBN component, contracts for hiring members of&#13;
the project review pane are pending; signing will be carried out soon after project effectiveness. For the Department of Electricity Development (DOED) component,&#13;
the TOR for hiring a firm for the cumulative impact assessment has been finalized and procurement is underway.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Nepal has rich hydropower resources that could potentially support export of hydropower to other countries in the region. However, it faces an energy crisis of&#13;
     unprecedented severity (up to 18 hours/day load shedding in dry seasons) due to generation shortages and transmission bottlenecks. IDA funding will help develop&#13;
     the transmission facility to exploit hydropower potential in the Kabeli River corridor, where about a dozen private power-generation projects are in various stages of&#13;
     development, including the Kabeli A Hydropower Plant, 37.6 MW, which is financed jointly by IDA/IFC.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The project aims to support the addition of transmission capacity to the Integrated Nepal Power System, and to provide access to electricity and cooking fuel to&#13;
     communities in the area of the Kabeli 132-kV transmission line. The project has three components: (i) construction of a new 132 kV transmission line in eastern Nepal,&#13;
     with associated substations; (ii) community-based rural electrification-grid extension; and (iii) enhanced rural energy services. The first and second components are&#13;
     under implementation by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), while the third is being implemented under the Alternative Energy Promotion Center (AEPC).&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     Of the 90-km-long transmission line, section I of 34 km is expected to be commissioned by September 2015, and this would enable transfer of 22 MW of electricity&#13;
     generated by the private hydropower generator. Of 95 towers, 91 have been erected and 31 km of the 34-km line strung. Construction work on section II will be started&#13;
     soon. All four substations within this transmission-line corridor as planned have been completed.&#13;
     Detailed rural electrification mapping for the 5-km corridor under the transmission line alignment has been completed. Under the micro-hydro (MH) component, 108&#13;
     solar home systems, nine institutional solar systems and 227 bio-gas plants have been provided. This component has been modified from developing community-&#13;
     based micro-hydro plants to a mini-grid connecting existing MH plants from Taplejung, Panchthar and Ilam, as communities were not interested in the MH plants&#13;
     initially identified. So far, 140 kW of existing MH plants are to be connected with the mini-grid.&#13;
&#13;
     Due to initial delays, the project completion date has been extended from June 30, 2015 to December 31, 2016.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
NNepal has rich hydropower resources that could potentially make revenues through export of hydropower to other countries in the region in the future. However, at&#13;
present it is facing energy crisis of unprecedented severity (up to 18 hours/day load shedding in dry seasons) due to generation shortages and transmission bottlenecks.&#13;
While the government is seeking both public and private investments in hydropower generation and transmission facilities in Nepal, this project complements the&#13;
government strategy for addressing the electricity shortages through import of electricity from India. It will also enable the export of surplus hydropower energy to&#13;
India in the long term.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The development objectives are to establish cross-border transmission capacity between India and Nepal of about 1,000 MW to facilitate electricity trade between the&#13;
two countries, and to increase the supply of electricity in Nepal by the sustainable import of at least 100 MW. The project has three components: (i) Component A1&#13;
and A2: the design, construction, and operation of approximately 130 km of a 400 kV double circuit north-south cross border transmission line between Muzaffarpur&#13;
in India and Dhalkebar in Nepal; (ii) Component B1, B2 and B3: the design, construction and operation of approximately 285 km of a 400 kV double circuit east-west&#13;
transmission line for the Hetauda-Dhalkebar-Inaruwa segment with concomitant substations in Nepal (B1), synchronization of operation of the Nepal and Indian&#13;
grids and Transmission Lines (B2) and Integrated Financial Management Information System of NEA (B3); and (iii) Component C: technical advice for: preparation&#13;

Construction of the cross-border 400 kV MD transmission line financed by the government and others as stated above was nearly completed and commissioning of the&#13;
line was expected in September 2015. For supply and installation of towers for the 400 kV HDI transmission line, the detailed route alignment survey and preparation&#13;
of plan profile is completed. The check survey is 96.25 percent complete. Of 399 locations involving private land affected by tower foundations, land parcels data have&#13;
been confirmed for 383. Of 790 towers, foundation work has been completed for 176, and 111 towers erected. Procurement for all major substations, conductors&#13;
and transformers under the project has been completed, and supply and installation are underway. Execution of the contract for transmission master plan signed&#13;
between NEA and EDF France on December 2, 2013 is on schedule. Data collection, demand forecast, generation scenario/export potential have been completed and&#13;
the draft final report was submitted to NEA. EDF also conducted a workshop to present the transmission master plan/draft final report to NEA and other key stakeholders&#13;
including development partners, private hydropower developers etc. for comment. The final report was expected in September 2015.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     The Nepal SREP-Supported Extended Biogas Project (NSEBP) is supported by the Scaling-up Renewable Energy Program in Low Income Countries (SREP) of the&#13;
     Strategic Climate Fund (SCF). The public launch of the project was held on February 3, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
     A recently issued government document notes that about 85 percent of the total final energy consumption in Nepal is met by biomass in terms of firewood (75&#13;
     percent), agricultural residues (4 percent), and animal waste (6 percent). The rest is met by commercial sources, such as petroleum products, coal, and electricity&#13;
     (around 2 percent). The low level of commercial energy consumption in the country reflects the very low level of industrial activities. Recent studies have indicated&#13;
     that Nepal has very good potential for expanded biogas production. Biogas can be used on-site for cooking, for industrial thermal heating processes (e.g. steam&#13;
     production), and also to produce electricity in retrofitted generators that can use both diesel and biogas. Frequently identified potential opportunities for commercial&#13;
     biogas production on a larger scale include cow farms, poultry farms, pig farms, slaughter houses, beverage industry, fruit processing, sugar mills, distilleries, hotel&#13;
     and restaurant kitchen scraps and food waste, and food processing establishments such as noodle factories. At present, firewood or coal is mostly used to produce&#13;
     steam during agro-processing, where steam is mechanically injected through pipes to boil and pasteurize food or heat other items, as required. By contrast, on-site&#13;
     availability of biogas (if generated from organic waste byproducts of the same production process) could be used instead to meet thermal energy requirements for&#13;
     steam generation.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The project development objective is to promote large off-grid biogas energy generation in Nepal. The project has two components: (i) technical assistance ($1 million);&#13;
     and (ii) financing of investments ($ 6.9 million).&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     Both project development objective indicators -- off-grid biogas generated for thermal application from large-scale project (&gt;12.5 m3) and off-grid biogas-based&#13;
     electricity generated -- have not shown any progress since none of the biogas projects have been commissioned so far. However, an assessment of the intermediate&#13;
     result indicator for the technical assistance component, namely the number of large biogas proposals submitted for investment evaluation, reveals that 34 sub-project&#13;
     proposals (or 85 percent of targeting 40 proposals for the first year of implementation) have been submitted since the project launch in February 2015. Among the 34&#13;
     sub-project proposals submitted, six sub-projects are in the detailed feasibility study stage and 16 are in the feasibility study stage.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Kali Gandaki A is a 144 MW run-of-river plant. It is the largest single hydroelectric facility in Nepal, providing about 25 percent of the total electricity supply in Nepal&#13;
as well as six hours per day of peaking capacity. It is located on the Kali Gandaki River in Syangja district, below the confluence of the Kali Gandaki and Andhi Khola&#13;
rivers. The ADB funded the original plant, with a total cost $453 million and it was commissioned in 2002. After 10 years of operation, the plantâ&#128;&#153;s available generation&#13;
capacity has sharply deteriorated due to sedimentation, erosion, and cavitation of the power turbines (from silt and floating debris). There are safety issues that need&#13;
to be addressed and a plant operations manual finalized to improve plant operation performance and dam safety management.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The project aims to improve the reliability of power supply from the plant, through rehabilitation and safety measures, as well as to improve the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s response&#13;
capacity in case of an energy crisis. The project has four components: (i) civil works ($9.1 million); (ii) electro-mechanical works ($16.6 million); (iii) technical assistance&#13;
and capacity-building ($4.7 million); and (iv) contingent emergency response (financing would be reallocated into this component if an emergency response were&#13;
required). The rehabilitation program aims to: improve dam safety management; reduce the total quantity of sediment entering into the turbine passage; reduce the&#13;
cavitation in the turbine in the dry season; and enhance plant safety by improving the operation of the main inlet valves, as well as by repairing the control systems.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
Procurement for four major activities has been completed. There have been implementation delays that are being discussed with NEA management to accelerate the&#13;
implementation. There were two reasons for the delays. First, legacy issues with the old suppliers, and, secondly, slow decision making on NEAâ&#128;&#153;s management side. The&#13;
issues with the old suppliers have been resolved. The negotiation with the contractor has resulted into cost savings of around $8 million.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     On April 25, 2015, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Nepal. That earthquake, and its sequence of aftershocks, caused 8,700 deaths and some 25,000 injuries.&#13;
     A Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), completed on June 15, 2015, found that total damages and losses resulting from the earthquake sequence amounted to&#13;
     about $7 billion, and reconstruction needs amounted to about $6.7 billion. As the earthquake sequence destroyed 490,000 houses -- mostly traditional mud-brick and&#13;
     mud-stone houses built and occupied by the rural poor -- and rendered another 265,000 houses at least temporarily uninhabitable, the largest single need identified&#13;
     in the PDNA was housing and human settlements, accounting for $3.27 billion of needs. This project will enable the reconstruction of about 15 percent of the housing&#13;
     destroyed in the earthquake sequence. An accompanying multi-donor trust fund is being established to enable development partners interested in contributing to&#13;
     housing reconstruction to participate in this effort.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The project aims to restore affected houses with multi-hazard resistant core housing units in targeted areas and to enhance the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ability to improve&#13;
     long-term disaster resilience. Component 1: Housing Reconstruction, $185 million. This component will finance the provision of housing grants for reconstruction of&#13;
     approximately 55,000 multi-hazard resilient core housing units. Eligibility will be determined by an assessment of recovery needs and willingness to participate and&#13;
     adhere to project guidelines for resilient construction, quality standards, and timelines. The component will also finance the establishment of a program of owner-&#13;
     driven housing reconstruction in targeted areas including: (i) social, environmental, and technical support mechanisms for beneficiary households; (ii) training of&#13;
     artisans and beneficiaries; (iii) communication and outreach; (iv) supervision and certification of compliance with multi-hazard resistant standards and of completion&#13;
     of multi-hazard resilient core housing units; (v) implementation of the environmental and social management framework including identified safeguard mitigation&#13;
     measures; (vi) development of a grievance redress mechanism; and, vii) other enabling activities. Component 2: Disaster Risk Management Systems, $10 million.&#13;
     This component will support the government in putting in place systems to provide better disaster risk reduction, preparedness, and disaster response, in line with&#13;
     global best practices. The component will finance, as needed, support in the areas of, among others, disaster risk management, risk assessment and financing,&#13;
     structural engineering, remote sensing, land use and zoning, permitting and approval of site and building plans, professional accreditation, curriculum development,&#13;
     building code implementation and enforcement, studies on safety net practices in postâ&#128;&#147;disaster situations, and inclusive and gendered practices in disaster-mitigation&#13;
     planning. Component 3: Project Implementation Support, $5 million. This component will finance the establishment and operation of the project management&#13;
     unit, the project implementing units, and the district-level project implementation units. This will cover support to strengthening capacity to effectively procure and&#13;
     manage delivery systems, including damage assessment, beneficiary household identification, payment system, management information system, grievance redress,&#13;
     and communication/outreach. In addition, the component will also finance consultancies/service providers required for the preparation and supervision of specific&#13;
     activities, monitoring, and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The program operations manual and Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) are at advanced stages and being consulted.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The beneficiary survey, which will define the household eligibility for the program, is advancing and planned to be launched in October.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The uniform housing platform is coalescing, with donors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) converging on a single approach for reconstruction&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
In 2004, donors moved to a sector-wide approach (SWAp) in the health sector to align donor support with the government of Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s priorities and also reduce&#13;
transaction costs to the government. The International Development Agency (IDA), DFID, AusAID, KfW of Germany and GAVI, the Swiss-based vaccine network, are&#13;
currently pooling funds. The sector-wide approach aims to address key challenges, including: (i) access, social inclusion and equality in health-service utilization; (ii)&#13;
making better progress on the MDG targets for nutrition and HIV/AIDS, which are not on track; (iii) sector governance and accountability; and (iv) maintaining gains in&#13;
reducing maternal mortality and increasing vitamin A and immunization coverage.&#13;
&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s original closing date was July 15, 2015. However, the Bank received a request for an extension of the closing date by six months to help the government&#13;
to respond to the needs arising from the April 2015 earthquake. The project was extended until January 15, 2016.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The project aims to enable the government to increase access to essential health-care services and their utilization by the poor and the underserved. Its targets are to&#13;
increase the percentage of pregnant women receiving iron and folic acid to 87 percent, with 90 percent of children being fully immunized and skilled attendance at&#13;
35 percent of births.&#13;
&#13;
With components of health-service delivery and health systems strengthening, the project supports the Nepal Health Sector Program II, which aims to increase access&#13;
to and utilization of quality essential health services, reduce cultural and economic barriers to accessing health care services, and improve the health system to achieve&#13;
universal health coverage.&#13;
&#13;
The government has assumed responsibility for achieving these goals by extending and sustaining coverage of essential health care services, including reproductive&#13;
health, child health, communicable and non-communicable disease control, curative care, oral health, eye care, environmental health, and rehabilitation of disabled&#13;
people. The program ensures free health care to all who access services in public-health facilities at district hospitals, primary care centers, and health posts.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
Two of the three results indicators exceed targets: coverage of skilled birth attendance has reached 55.6 percent, and iron folic acid coverage has increased to 91&#13;
percent. Nutritional status of children under five has improved, with a decline in stunting from 49 percent in 2006 to 37.4 percent in 2014, and in underweight status&#13;
from 39 percent to 30.1 percent in 2014.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     As part of the scaling-up nutrition movement, the government has realized the need to address malnutrition across multiple sectors, and has developed and endorsed&#13;
     a multi-sector nutrition plan for the country. The plan envisages an equal role of nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions in realizing the nutrition goals&#13;
     during the first 1,000 days of a childâ&#128;&#153;s life. Motivated by this initiative, the Bank has extended support to the implementing agency through the Sunaula Hazar Din&#13;
     project to address community-wide risk factors that contribute to malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
     The project was currently restructured in order to also address the emergency nutrition needs in the 14 critically affected districts following the earthquake that struck&#13;
     Nepal on April 25, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     In order to cater the needs of the earthquake affected districts, the project development objective was revised to â&#128;&#156;to improve practices that contribute to reduced under-&#13;
     nutrition of women of reproductive age and children under the age of two and to provide emergency nutrition and sanitation response to vulnerable populations in&#13;
     earthquake affected areas.â&#128;&#157; The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MOFALD) implements the project by rolling-out a social mobilization initiative&#13;
     through a community-driven Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives (RRNIs), where each ward in a selected Village Development Committee (VDC) will commit to a&#13;
     series of pre-defined nutrition-relevant goals, each to be met within a 100-day period. The achievement of the goals will be the responsibility of RRNI teams (one for&#13;
     each ward), supported by a coach who will support all RRNI teams in one VDC. The RRNI approach will be rolled out in a sequenced manner across the original 15&#13;
     project districts. An impact evaluation is built into the project design.&#13;
     The earthquake relief component will be implemented through an assistance from UNICEF, which has recently signed an agreement with the MOFALD to support the&#13;
     delivery of essential evidence-based emergency nutrition interventions to protect the lives of children, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers in the 14 affected&#13;
     districts in a period of nine months.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     Approximately 1,485 sub-projects have now been completed and at least 1,000 additional sub-projects are currently running in the early starter project VDCs. The&#13;
     remaining half of project VDCs will implement sub-projects starting FY2016.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Public financial management (PFM) is a key element of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s strategy for strengthening public service delivery and ensuring inclusive and broad-based&#13;
development. After the recent earthquake there is greater need for directing appropriate resources in an efficient, timely, transparent, and accountable manner towards&#13;
relief and reconstruction activities. As part of this effort, a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) to support PFM was established in December 2010. Currently there are seven&#13;
donors to the MDTF: the European Union (EU), DFID, the government of the Swiss Confederation, the governments of Norway and Denmark, DFAT and USAID.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The MDTF aims to strengthen the performance, transparency and accountability of public financial management systems in Nepal. The trust fund has four components:&#13;
(i) strengthening PFM systems and capacity; (ii) enhancing accountability in PFM; (iii) deepening knowledge related to PFM by undertaking analytical work for&#13;
knowledge dissemination, and (iv) program management and administration. Currently, there are sub-projects under MDTF to modernize the PFM systems both&#13;
through the supply side and demand side. Supply side work includes: a project with the Ministry of Finance to modernize payments through a Treasury Single Account&#13;
(TSA); upgrading audit systems through an intervention with auditor general; and strengthening budget process for results. Demand side work aims to expand civil&#13;
society demand-side collaboration with the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s supply-side services on PFM accountability, transparency and inclusion. In addition, the trust fund helped&#13;
conduct analytics (operational risk assessment framework and public expenditure tracking survey) to inform the PFM reform dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
TSA has been rolled out across all 75 districts one year ahead of target and operates on an on-line basis. More than 13,500 of approximately 14,000 bank accounts&#13;
have been closed, leading to interest cost savings of over $2 million. The Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO) website publishes daily, monthly and quarterly&#13;
budget execution reports that has led to informed decision making by line managers across departments. Core treasury systems have been enhanced to pilot&#13;
commitment control and revenue management information systems. Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s financial reporting standards (both public sector and private sector) have been aligned&#13;
with international standards. The second Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment has recently been completed that evidences upgrades to&#13;
19 indicators (61 percent) and high impact research has been initiated. Implementation of risk-based audit planning according to International Standards of Supreme&#13;
Audit Institutions (ISSAI) framework has been initiated in the Office of the Auditor General (OAGN). Performance audit is at par with ISSAI Standards. Efficiency in&#13;
audit process has been enhanced through use of electronic working papers. Peer review of OAGN completed by a team from the comptroller and auditor general of&#13;
India will help develop next strategic development plan. Due to collaboration between civil society organizations and the OAG, a multi-stakeholder working group has&#13;
been created and developed broad guidelines to mainstream citizen participation in performance audits in Nepal. The demand-side project led to increased citizen&#13;
awareness about the local planning and budgeting process, greater participation by women and marginalized groups in local governance structures, and the use&#13;
of the community scorecard to improve the community management of government schools. Line Ministry Budget Information System supported FY2016 budget&#13;
formulation. General Equilibrium Model of Nepal and the World simulated a post-disaster needs assessment reconstruction scenario.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     The Joint Monitoring Program database notes that Nepal has achieved the MDG target for access to improved water supply but is off target for access to improved&#13;
     sanitation. The true situation in rural areas may be worse, as surveys conducted by the National Management Information Project show that 44 percent of the existing&#13;
     rural water systems are in need of repairs or rehabilitation. There are challenges to achieving the national targets for universal access by 2017. Sustainability and&#13;
     functionality of water schemes and sanitation systems have increasingly been a source of concern. The project supports efforts to adopt an inclusive, community-driven&#13;
     approach in which local communities play the lead role in planning, design and implementation of schemes, as well as in the operation and maintenance of services.&#13;
     The project also aims to support the long-term sustainability of water supply systems in selected districts.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The development objectives of the project are to: (i) increase sustainable access to improved water services and promote improved sanitation and hygiene practices&#13;
     in rural areas; and (ii) develop and implement a long-term support mechanism to promote the sustainability of water-supply schemes in selected districts. The&#13;
     components of the project are: (i) increasing access to improved water supply and sanitation and hygiene practices; (ii) district level institutional strengthening; (iii)&#13;
     technical assistance/capacity building and project management; and (iv) contingency emergency response. The project is implemented in 55 districts, which were&#13;
     selected based on objective ranking with respect to their access to safe water and sanitation. Thus, the project has a strong poverty focus, as it also reach out the&#13;
     unserved areas.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     Of 397 schemes targeted in Batch IX under retroactive financing, 154 schemes were completed, and 3,512 community water points were constructed, benefiting over&#13;
     22,000 households (135,000 people) with access to safe water. With the projectâ&#128;&#153;s social inclusion and gender focus, 49.4 percent of beneficiaries are female, 15.5&#13;
     percent are Dalit, 32.5 percent are disadvantaged Janajati and 4 percent are religious minority. The remaining 243 schemes are under implementation at various&#13;
     phases. With completion of these schemes by the end of 2015, close to 400,000 people will have access to safe water.&#13;
&#13;
     A Sanitation Revolving Loan Fund approach is adopted for 424 retroactive schemes carried over from RWSSP-II. Retroactive schemes are operated in 68 VDCs. A total&#13;
     16,360 household and 68 institutional toilets were constructed. From Batch X onward, a Community Led Total Sanitation approach will be followed.&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
The existing bridge stock in Nepal is over 35-40 years old and in urgent need of rehabilitation and maintenance. There are still many gaps in the Strategic Roads&#13;
Network (SRN) caused by lack of bridges. This contributes to a substantial lack of physical access to economic centers and social services, particularly in remote areas.&#13;
Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s topography and geology also complicate efforts to provide adequate transport infrastructure. The lack of physical access is seen as one of the root causes of the&#13;
high level of poverty incidence in remote areas. The Bridges Improvement and Maintenance Program has been designed by the government to address these issues.&#13;
&#13;
PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The project aims to provide safe, reliable, and cost-effective bridges on Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s SRN. It supports the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s initiative under the Program for Results lending&#13;
instrument (the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s first such advance through IDA, and the first infrastructure project/program to use this instrument). The overall program outlay is approximately&#13;
$150 million and the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s share is roughly 40 percent. The scope of the program encompasses three primary activities: (i) planning, technical design and quality&#13;
control of bridges; (ii) major and minor maintenance of existing bridge assets; and (iii) new bridge construction. It has six DLIs .&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The program has successfully turned around its status from unsatisfactory to satisfactory, and is on course to achieve its targets.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The mid-term review suggests that all the program development objective (PDO) indicators are likely to be achieved. And the program is making good progress&#13;
       in achieving all DLIs related to PDO indicators. For instance, the following are the achievements; (i) percentage of bridges on SRN rated as being in good or fair&#13;
       condition â&#128;&#147; 56.1 percent (target: 75 percent); (ii) percentage of bridges on SRN rated as structurally unsafe â&#128;&#147; 3.74 percent (target: 1 percent); (iii) percentage of&#13;
       bridge works completed on planned schedule â&#128;&#147; 26 percent (target: 50 percent).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The program has achieved a significant accomplishment in preparation and implementation of major maintenance works.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     Nepal is a geographically small landlocked country nestled between China and India, the worldâ&#128;&#153;s two most populous nations and among the worldâ&#128;&#153;s most rapidly&#13;
     growing economies. Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s territory is mostly mountainous and hilly and its transport infrastructure is poor, leaving many communities with limited access to local&#13;
     and international markets. As a consequence, transport costs are high and the country depends almost entirely on India for transit routes. Sharing an approximately&#13;
     1,800-km-long border and 26 border points, India is often considered Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;naturalâ&#128;&#157; trading partner. The port complex of Kolkata-Haldia in India has been serving&#13;
     as Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s access to the sea and is a major transit point for Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s third-country trade. India also provides a large market for Nepali goods and services, and is Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     largest trading partner, with about 60 percent of Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s trade going to or coming from India. Despite its proximity and deep economic relations with India as well&#13;
     as China, Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s trade outcomes have been poor. Since 2007, exports have been stagnant while imports have increased by more than 50 percent. That suggests an&#13;
     urgent need for an action plan to improve export competitiveness particularly by focusing on reducing inefficiencies and bottlenecks that increase the cost of exports&#13;
     on regional and international markets.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The main development objective is to decrease transport time and logistics costs for bilateral trade between Nepal and India and transit trade along the Kathmandu-&#13;
     Kolkata corridor for the benefit of traders by reducing key infrastructure bottlenecks in Nepal and by supporting the adoption of modern approaches to border&#13;
     management. The strategy includes: (i) reducing the time and cost of trade-related transactions through efforts at simplification, harmonization, and automation; (ii)&#13;
     building the capacity of domestic trade-related institutions, including for sanitary and phyto-sanitary inspections, trade negotiations, logistics, and monitoring and&#13;
     regulating trade-related sectors; and, (iii) enhancing the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s ability to coordinate trade-related institutions and development partners.&#13;
&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Nepal has the second lowest road network density in the region. Only two-fifths of the population has access to paved roads within a 20-minute walk. The substantial lack&#13;
of accessibility to economic centers and social services in the remote areas is seen as one of the main impediments to poverty reduction and economic development.&#13;
By 2016, the government of Nepal aims for 86 percent of the population to live within two hours (in the plain districts) or four hours (in hilly districts) walking distance&#13;
to a paved road. Connection of all district headquarters with all-weather roads has been one of the key elements of the Road Sector Priority Investment Plan of 2007.&#13;
The Road Sector Development Project (RDSP) has been designed against this backdrop to support the Strategic Roads Network.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The project seeks to provide all-season road access to the residents of beneficiary districts, reducing travel time and improving access to economic centers and&#13;
social services. The project aims to connect eight remote district headquarters in the Mid-Western and Far-Western regions of Nepal. The original project outlay was&#13;
approximately $43 million with additional financing of $75 million. However, in June 2015 an amount of SDR4.5m ($6.75m) was cancelled as requested by the&#13;
government. The project components are: (i) road development (utilizing 83 percent of the funding); and (ii) institutional strengthening and policy reform. In the&#13;
aftermath of the devastating April 2015 earthquake the project closing date was extended by a year to June 2016.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
A 2012 survey showed that the amount of paved roads in poor condition had been reduced to 11.3 percent, below the target of 15 percent.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      An interim analysis using the Geographic Information Systems shows that the target of increasing the populationâ&#128;&#153;s access to all-weather roads (6 percent) is likely&#13;
       to be achieved.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      All major contracts, barring six linked to road component, are now completed. The Periodic Maintenance target has been achieved with the completion of&#13;
       2,610km against the target of 2,550km. All eight district headquarters of Mid-Western and Far-Western regions are now connected.&#13;
All RSDP road safety contracts funded by Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF) under Road Safety Support Project (RSSP) are now completed.&#13;

&#13;
     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     The government of Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s continuing efforts to expand road access to a greater number of districts has often omitted safety-related considerations. Statistics from&#13;
     the Nepal Police Traffic Directorate estimate that in FY2012/13 there were over 13,500 road traffic accidents in Nepal. The challenges posed by road safety outside the&#13;
     Kathmandu Valley tend to be more severe than in the valley itself. For example, in FY2009/10, the rate of fatalities per 10,000 registered vehicles in regions outside&#13;
     Kathmandu ranged from 7 to 33 times higher than the rate of fatalities observed in the valley. In many instances this disparity is a result of mass-casualty events&#13;
     from vertical drops that are a common feature on roads in Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s hill and mountain districts. In this context, the RSSP has been designed with the support of Global&#13;
     Road Safety Phase 2 Multi-Donor Trust Fund to improve the safety features of the IDA supported Road Sector SDP roads. RSDP has been serving as a key program in&#13;
     developing Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s strategic road network in the Far and Mid-Western regions.&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The project objective is to reduce the risk of roadway departure crashes on selected sections of RSDP roads and to strengthen the government of Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s capacity for&#13;
     improving road safety. The project total outlay is $7.47 million (4.5m Great British Pound equivalent) that will fund investments in parallel to the IDA-supported RSDP.&#13;
&#13;
     There are two components:&#13;
&#13;
     Component A â&#128;&#147; Capacity strengthening for the Implementation of Road Safety Action Plan ($0.80 million equivalent).&#13;
     Component B â&#128;&#147; Improved physical safety of RSDP roads ($6.67 million equivalent). This component funds procurement and installation of crash barriers in high-risk&#13;
     sections of RSDP roads.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The project is in its initial stage of implementation. However, it has made substantial progress with regard to both the components. Initial evidence confirms that&#13;
            the project is most likely to achieve its objectives if the current pace of implementation is sustained.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      DOR has already procured the crash barrier contracts including the contracts of the inspection agent.&#13;
     Capacity strengthening component is progressing well. The Nepal Road Safety Council has been established and the procurement processes for goods and consultancies&#13;
     are being initiated. DOR has also completed the preparation of Detailed Project Reports of two pilot road-safety activities (one in Pokhara sub-metropolitan city and&#13;
     the other one in a small stretch of a highway.)&#13;

PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
Over the past decade, poverty has reduced significantly in rural areas of Nepal, where 83 percent of the population lives. To maintain this positive trend and to achieve&#13;
significant development gains, it is necessary to continue the effort to improve transport connectivity in rural areas. Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s topography and geology, combined with&#13;
rural population distribution, significantly complicate efforts to provide all-weather transport links to many rural communities. Improving connectivity throughout&#13;
Nepal is key to ensuring that economic growth reaches rural areas. The project has been designed to enhance physical access to markets and social and economic&#13;
services, as well as assistance during emergency events. Initially, 33 districts are eligible to participate under the project, which covers more than half of the total&#13;
population of Nepal. It is the third IDA operation to support Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s rural transport sector in the past 15 years.&#13;
&#13;
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
The objective is to enhance the availability and reliability of transport connectivity for rural communities in participating districts. Components call for institutional&#13;
strengthening and technical assistance ($19.7 million) and civil works ($155.7 million). The first will fund: (i) institutional strengthening and technical assistance;&#13;
(ii) beneficiary monitoring of physical works of the project; and (iii) an impact study of selected project interventions. The other component will support districts in&#13;
upgrading or rehabilitating rural transport infrastructure, and maintaining rural transport infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The project is in its early stage of implementation. It had faced some teething problems. However, initial indications show that the project is set to accomplish its&#13;
       physical targets and likely to achieve its indicators (both PDO and intermediate results indicators).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The progress of output-based maintenance sub-component is satisfactory. In fact, the routine maintenance achievements are ahead of the plan (Year 2 target:&#13;
       740km; achievement as of July 2015: 2,639 km)&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The project has also made good progress in periodic maintenance related activities. It is expected to achieve its Year 2 target (757 km).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Good progress has been made with regard to road upgrading/rehabilitation sub-component. The progress with regard to institutional strengthening and techni-&#13;
       cal assistance component has been satisfactory.&#13;

     PROJECT BACKGROUND:&#13;
     The project marks the re-engagement of the World Bank in the urban sector in Nepal after an absence of more than 10 years. It aims at developing a sustainable&#13;
     approach for strengthening the planning, implementation, and revenue-raising capacity of six emerging towns (each 30,000-70,000 population) located in the&#13;
     Western and Eastern regions of Nepal. The municipalities have been selected based on their growth potential and their strategic location along the North-South&#13;
     transport corridors (highways).&#13;
&#13;
     PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND BRIEF COMPONENT DESCRIPTION:&#13;
     The objective of this project is to improve the capacity of the participating municipalities to plan, implement, and fund urban development activities. It has three&#13;
     components: (i) strengthening municipal planning capacity through provision of grants to the municipalities; (ii) provision of financing for municipal infrastructure&#13;
     sub-projects to improve municipal capacity to implement infrastructure investments; and (iii) institutional development and project management support to the&#13;
     participating municipalities and project agencies.&#13;
&#13;
     RESULTS ACHIEVED:&#13;
     The project has been improving the planning and implementation capacity of the six participating municipalities for municipal development investments in line with&#13;
     the project objective. All municipal sub-projects have entered into the construction phase, and construction works are on track in eight of the 15 sub-projects. The&#13;
     municipalities have utilized the municipal grants to carry out small works, such as road upgrading, with at least 35 percent of the grant resources earmarked toward&#13;
     activities benefiting women and disadvantaged groups. Institutional development activities support municipalities to prepare their own revenue mobilization plan,&#13;
     asset management, and investment plan. Despite some delay, the project continues to work closely with municipalities for institutional development.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Nepal experienced a massive shock with
            two devas¬tating earthquakes causing large damage, slowing
            growth. In addition, revenues underperformed lead¬ing to a
            deficit. Remittances surged in the aftermath of the
            disasters resulting in a strong current account surplus and
            growing reserves. Growth will continue to be affected in
            FY2016 due to delays in setting up the National
            Reconstruction Authority and increased political
            instability. As the political process stabilizes and
            recovery starts in full, growth is expected to re¬bound.
            Nepal faces several simultaneous challenges ahead, effective
            implementation of post-earth¬quake recovery coupled with the
            completion of political transition to a new federal
            constitu¬tion while leveraging its endowments (hydro¬power
            potential, human capital) to achieve a faster growth and
            create economic opportuni¬ties for its citizens at home.
            Low- and middle-income countries in general tend to
            experience a permanent loss of potential out¬put following a
            geological disaster like the one ex¬perienced by Nepal given
            their lower capacity to execute spending efficiently and
            effectively in re¬building lost capital stock. In fact, the
            key growth constraint for Nepal in the past has been the
            insuf¬ficient public investment and resulting
            infrastruc¬ture deficit. While the quantity of public
            invest¬ment may increase as a result of a newly proposed and
            empowered National Reconstruction Author¬ity, ensuring the
            quality of spending will be even more critical. Furthermore,
            permanently lower oil prices may re¬duce economic
            opportunities in the oil-exporting Gulf Cooperation Council
            countries, which are an important destination for Nepali
            migrants and a key source of remittances for the country.
