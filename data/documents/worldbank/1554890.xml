Abstract&#13;
The availability of World Fertility Survey data on 25&#13;
developing countries has allowed us to estimate the effect of infant and&#13;
child mortality on the number of births in two ways.          First, it is&#13;
possible to estimate the effect of an infant/child death on the period&#13;
between births.     For women who breastfeed their children,      an infant&#13;
death tends to shorten her period of infertility following a birth and&#13;
thus, in the absence of contraception, reduce the interval between&#13;
births. This has the effect of increasing the number of births over her&#13;
reproductive life.    While the results vary by the technique used, our&#13;
best estimates show that in this way the prevention of one infant death&#13;
averts between .016 births in Trinidad and .351 births in Lesotho with&#13;
an average of .23 for neonatal and .17 for post-neonatal deaths.        This&#13;
represents the lower limit of the effect of an infant/child death.&#13;
The total effect of infant/child mortality on number of&#13;
birthsdepends not only on biological effects through breastfeeding, but&#13;
on behavioral   adjustments through the use of contraception.        Thus a&#13;
second method of estimating the effect is to measure the number of&#13;
subsequent births a couple has depending on the survival or death of&#13;
their first few births.    This technique is likely to capture both the&#13;
biological and behavioral effects of infant/child mortality.       Our best&#13;
estimates show that couples with an infant death have between .138 more&#13;
births in Sri Lanka and .808 more births in Syria with an average of&#13;
.484 more births than those who do not experience such a death.       These&#13;
represent the upper limit on the effect of an infant/child death.&#13;
These effects are larger on average than those reported from&#13;
earlier studies but far smaller than would be necessary for mortality&#13;
declines to be fully compensated by averted births.     There may, however,&#13;
exist externalities or societal changes operating over the long run in&#13;
response to community levels of mortality which cannot be estimated with&#13;
data on individuals and their own mortality and fertility experiences.&#13;
In an illustrative analysis presented in this paper, the cost&#13;
of averting a birth through a family planning program is compared with&#13;
the cost of averting a birth indirectly by preventing an infant death.&#13;
In the 16 countries for which estimates could be made, there was one&#13;
case where mortality reduction was more "cost effective" for reducing&#13;
fertility than was family planning.      This was the case of Kenya.      If&#13;
data were available for other high mortality African countries, we may&#13;
well find the Kenya case replicated.      Thus this illustrative analysis&#13;
suggests that infant mortality may be an important component of a&#13;
fertility reduction program in countries where mortality is high and few&#13;
couples are able to have the number of surviving children they desire.&#13;

Infant and Child Mortality as a Determinant of Fertility:&#13;
The Policy Implications*&#13;
by Susan H. Cochrane and K. C. Zachariah&#13;
This paper is devoted to exploring some aspects of the effect of&#13;
infant and child mortality on fertility.     It does not exhaust all aspects&#13;
of that relationship and, of course, the effect of mortality on fertility&#13;
is only part of the total relationship between the two variables.       To de-&#13;
sign analysis and projects one must be aware of the converse direction of&#13;
causation.&#13;
The 1975 Bangkok Conference represents the existing state of the&#13;
evidence on the effect of infant and child mortality on fertility.          The&#13;
conclusion of that conference has been summarized as "on average, an addi-&#13;
tional child death in the family, ceteris paribus, leads to far less than&#13;
one additional birth". (Preston, 1978, 11).&#13;
While this effect was observed to vary depending on the level of&#13;
socio-economic development, it is less than one half in all the countries&#13;
studied (Preston, 1975, 191).    This agrees with one elasticity of .33 that&#13;
McGreevey and Birdsall found in their review of the evidence (McGreevey and&#13;
Birdsall, 1974, 65).&#13;
There is substantial new evidence available from World Fertility&#13;
Survey that will be reviewed in this paper.       That evidence shows varying&#13;
impacts of mortality on fertility depending on the methodology used.         In&#13;
this paper we wish to both review a set of new WFS tabulations on 25&#13;
countries which estimate the effect of a woman's mortality experience on&#13;
her fertility behavior and to put that evidence into a context which will&#13;
help address the policy issues.&#13;
* This paper was World Bank's contribution to the UN Expert Group&#13;
Meeting on Fertility held in Delhi, India on January 5-11, 1983.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This approach focuses on the narrowly defined effects of an indi-&#13;
vidual couple's infant and child mo-tality experience on their fertility,&#13;
but it ignores the long term communal aggregate effects, such as changes in&#13;
perceived mortality which change insurance motivations for ch`ld bearing&#13;
and changes in the age at marriage. These latter issues are extremely rel-&#13;
evant to the long run demographic balance, but cannot be examiined in a&#13;
paper of this length.    (See Coale, 1973 for a discussion of the two demo-&#13;
graphic transitions--the first in age of marriage and the second in marital&#13;
fertility).&#13;
Unanswered Policy Questions&#13;
There are many different ways of interpreting the question: "Does&#13;
mortality decline affect fertility?'     At one extreme there are those who&#13;
claim that a mortality decline will bring about an equal decline in fertil-&#13;
ity. If this interpretation were correct, one could achieve mortality re-&#13;
ductions, which are desirable in and of themselves, without paying the&#13;
price of prolonged acceleration in population growth0 The work cited above&#13;
indicates this is not the case0      13ut other policy questions need to be&#13;
answered.   (1)   Is mortality decline necessary to initiate fertility de-&#13;
cline?  (2)   Is mortality decline a cost-effective way to initiate fertil-&#13;
ity decline? and (3)    Do mortality reduction (health) and family planning&#13;
programs have a synergistic effect?&#13;
The policy implications of these questions differ substantially.&#13;
If any one of them is answered in the affirmative, it implies that there&#13;
may be arguments for investing in nortality reducing programs beyond what&#13;
is desired on health grounds alone in order to stimulate fertility decline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
If mortality decline is necessary to initiate fertility decline,&#13;
then health programs must be introduced prior to or in tandem with family&#13;
planning programs.    The issue of lags is critical to understanding the&#13;
proper timing of the introduction of various programs.     Even if mortality&#13;
decline is not necessary to bring about fertility decline, it maybe a cost-&#13;
effective way to do so.   The cost-effectiveness of health programs or mor-&#13;
tality reduction in bringing about fertility reduction must not be con-&#13;
sidered only vis-a-vis family planning programs, but also vis-a-vis other&#13;
programs, such a improvement in education, but to do so is beyond the scope&#13;
of this paper.&#13;
The weakest statement of the relationship would be that health&#13;
and family programs will have a synergistic effect because mortality de-&#13;
cline enhances the motivation for family planning.    Whether such synergys-&#13;
tic effects can be capitalized on depends on the increased problems, in-&#13;
creased costs and perhaps reduced efficiency that arise from combining pro-&#13;
grams.&#13;
It early on became obvious from the literature that in general,&#13;
mortality decline has not always been necessary for fertility decline.      In&#13;
both the U.S. and France, fertility decline began before or simultaneously&#13;
with mortality decline.    This probably resulted from massive economic and&#13;
social changes which shifted the demand for children downward.&#13;
In many currently developing countries there may be massive&#13;
changes which would lead parents to want fewer children than they could&#13;
have with unrestricted fertility and existing mortality rates. This would&#13;
lead to a demand to restrict fertility through contraceptives or changes in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
age of marriage. Therefore, instead of discussing necessity (wthich is dif-&#13;
ficult to prove in any case), it is more productive to discuss alternative&#13;
strategies for reducing either population growth or fertility.&#13;
Here we come to an important decision point both for policy and&#13;
for research. Should the objective of policy be simply to minimixe popula-&#13;
tion growtho   In the analysis here it was assumed that mortality reduction&#13;
is an end in and of itself.    Therefore, to achieve demographic balance one&#13;
must determine what strategies would maximize fertility reduction0 In this&#13;
paper two strategies were examined, (i) reduce infant mortality and&#13;
(ii) increase access to family planning.      I-le expected that the optimal&#13;
strategy would vary depending on tne environment and our analysis verifies&#13;
this point.&#13;
The comparision of these two strategies required that we estimate&#13;
(i) the cost of preventing an addit;ional birth through expanding the family&#13;
planning program in a country, (ii) the cost of preventing an infant death&#13;
through an expansion of a health program, and (iii) the effect of infant&#13;
mortality on fertility0    There are substantial difficulties in estimating&#13;
the costs of preventing a birth or an infant or child death which will be&#13;
discussed later, but the primary function of this paper is to estimate the&#13;
effect of infant and child mortality on fertility using WFS data from 25&#13;
countries0&#13;
THE CHANNELS:  THEORY AND MEASUREMENT&#13;
The channels through which infant and child mortality may affect&#13;
fertility are biological and behavioral.    The behavioral effects may oper-&#13;
ate at the community as well as the individual level. The ease of measur-&#13;
ing the effects varies by the channel being considered with the communal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
being the most nebulous.   For this reason we will review first the biolog-&#13;
ical, then the individual behavioral effects but as mentioned above we will&#13;
ignore communal effects in this paper.&#13;
The Biological Effects&#13;
The biological effect of infant mortality and to a lesser extent&#13;
child mortality on fertility operates through the premature termination of&#13;
breastfeeding and the consequent shorter post-partum amenorrhea.         This&#13;
effect was very widely reviewed, modeled, and estimated (Potter, 1963)&#13;
(Perrin and Sheps, 1964) (Sheps and Perrin, 1964).      The magnitude of the&#13;
effect will depend on the normal length of breastfeeding and the relation-&#13;
ship between breastfeeding and amenorrhea.      There are substantial cross&#13;
country differences in the length of breastfeeding, and differences in the&#13;
estimated relationship between breastfeeding and amenorrhea.      The longest&#13;
observed average   amenorrhea   is  18.9  months  in  Bangladesh  (Bongaarts,&#13;
1978).    Chen reports that 45% of the length of the birth intervals could&#13;
be accounted for by lactation amenorrhea (Chen, et.al., 1974).       There is&#13;
evidence that the relationship between lactation and amenorrhea depends on&#13;
the nutritional status of the mother (Bongaarts, 1979, 15) and the pattern&#13;
of  supplemental  feeding of the child.       In an environment   similar to&#13;
Bangladesh infant and child mortality could substantially alter breastfeed-&#13;
ing, shorten birth intervals and increase the number of children ever born&#13;
if contraception is not used.&#13;
The biological effect can be measured by comparing the birth in-&#13;
tervals in which the previous child died and in which the child survived,&#13;
controlling for a number of variables to be discussed later.      These birth&#13;
intervals could be contaminated by behavioral effects as well, however, if&#13;
contraception for spacing is used and its adoption depends on the survival&#13;
status of the child.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Table 1 sumnmarizes HFS d;ata on the effect of a child loss on&#13;
redlan birth intervals. Table 2 shoÂ§s the medians for those w5h$ have never&#13;
contracepted.   Table 3 summarizes regression coefficients for showing the&#13;
effect of a child death on the birth interval controlling for iother's age,&#13;
mother's education, husband's occupation,, twife's status and rural resi-&#13;
dence. The expected pattern is that the longer the child lives, the longer&#13;
the birth interval.    The difference in birth intervals reflects the in-&#13;
crease in exposure to child bearing caused by infant mortality.      The data&#13;
does not perfectly fit this expecta.tion.    In a third of the c2ses for the&#13;
first, third and fifth intervals, there is a deviation from the expected&#13;
pattern.   This is explained in part by the small number of cases In some&#13;
categories.   In addition, the data on birth intervals are not of uniformly&#13;
good quality in all countries. Averoages over the 22 countries w:ith compar-&#13;
able data show that in the first interval, a neonatal death shortens the&#13;
interval by 4.7 months and a postneonatal death by 2.4.        For third and&#13;
fifth intervals, the figures are 423, 325 and 4.1, 3.6 respectively.&#13;
The majority of the effects measured above are probably biolo-&#13;
gical, but the difference in birth intervals between those whose previ,ous&#13;
child died and those whose previous child survived also depends on whether&#13;
child loss affects how long a couple uses faiWly planning in that birth&#13;
interval0   To control for this factor, We show the median birth intervals&#13;
by child survival for those women who have never used contraceptives in&#13;
Table 20   Here, as in Table 1, slightly over a third of the cases deviate&#13;
from the expected pattern and the 'values do not differ systematically from&#13;
those found for all women0   In sunifary then medians indicate Peonatal mor&#13;
tality increases birth intervals by between 3.2 and 600 months on average&#13;
and postneonatal by 1.7 to 3080&#13;

The regression results in Table 3 show negative effects of an in-&#13;
fant death on birth intervals in almost all cases and negative significant&#13;
effects are observed in 49% of the cases.     The average values of all coef-&#13;
ficients for a neonatal death for the first, third and fifth birth interval&#13;
are 7.7, 5.1 and 5.8 respectively. The effect of a post neonatal death are&#13;
4.3, 5.5 and 5.8 when all coefficients are averaged.&#13;
For women who have never used contraceptives and for whom the&#13;
effects are thus more biological than behavioral, the effect of neonatal&#13;
mortality are 7.7, 5.5 and 5.9 and the effects of post neonatal are 4.0,&#13;
6.0 and 6.2.&#13;
Table 4 summarizes the effect of infant death on birth intervals&#13;
for three parities as estimated by median differences and regression equa-&#13;
tions for all women and those who have never contracepted.      The regression&#13;
equations give higher estimates of mortality effects than do median val-&#13;
ues.1/ No clear pattern emerges across parities, nor between all women and&#13;
those never using contraceptives.     More surprisingly postneonatal effects&#13;
are not always smaller than those of neonatal.&#13;
If is difficult to put these data in the context of other re-&#13;
search since the methodology is somewhat different, but in an earlier study&#13;
of rural and semi-urban areas of those countries the effect of an infant&#13;
death reduced the birth internal by 4.3, 3.5, 6.2 and 4.6 months respec-&#13;
tively in Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico (Rutstein and Medica,&#13;
1978).   For those countries our average regression coefficients for neo-&#13;
1/ This may arise because the use of medians allow no control even, indi-&#13;
rectly, for maternal health.     Healthier women will have shorter inter-&#13;
vals and lower child mortality ceteris paribus.       So the intervals for&#13;
children surviving are biased downwards, as is the difference in inter-&#13;
vals. To the extent that education, rural residence and husband's occu-&#13;
pation control for health, the regression equation do not have that&#13;
short coming.&#13;

Infant and Child Mortality Experience on Contrac2eptIve Use&#13;
The above data on birth intervals for all womoen incorporates be-&#13;
havioral as well as biological effects to the extent that mortaHity experi-&#13;
ence affects contraceptive usage in the lntervalb     Analysis of the effect&#13;
of child death experience on contraceptive usage is shown in Table 5.    For&#13;
women with between four and six children, we find that without exception&#13;
those women who have experienced a C:hild death are leSs likely ~o haVe ever&#13;
used contraceptives.   For current use wte find that In 23 of 25 cases those&#13;
who have had a child death are less like)y to be using contraception than&#13;
those with no death.&#13;
Combining all parities andi controlling for the nuffiber of children&#13;
ever born, rural residences, wlfe's educction, husbnid's occupation and&#13;
wife's work status,, the experience of child mortality reduces contraceptive&#13;
use in all cases and in 20 of 25 cases this is statistically significant at&#13;
the 5% level0  The largest effect is in Jamaica atih     a child death reduces&#13;
usage by 9.4 per 1000&#13;
Other data from multiple classification Oanalysis arn useful for&#13;
comparison here.   In Colombia,, woFen with one child death weree 2.3% less&#13;
likely to use contraceptives than those with no death0        OLr regr@ession&#13;

The Effect of Infant and Child Mortelity on Parity&#13;
The biological and behavioral responses to child mortaHity exper-&#13;
iences ultimately have their effect on completed family size. Table 6 sum-&#13;
marizes the effect of child mortality experience on parity progression ra-&#13;
tios. At parity 1, 2 and 3 those who have experienced child mortality have&#13;
a higher probability of having additional children than for those couples&#13;
who have not experienced mortality0    In the 189 comparisons on these three&#13;
parities there are only three exceptions to this pattern0    At higher pari-&#13;
ties 5 and 6, the pattern also prevails, but with a few more exceptions&#13;
(eight of 126 comparisons)0   In most cases we also find that the more re-&#13;
cent the death, the higher the probability of having an additional child.&#13;
That is, if the last child dies the progression ratio is higher than if the&#13;
next to last child died.    We find that among those with two or more chil&#13;
dren, if the second child dies, the probability of having an additional&#13;
child is 16% higher.    At parity 6 it is 20% higher0    Rutstein and Medica&#13;
calculated adjusted parity progression ratios based on mortality experi-&#13;
ence0   Their data show much smaller effects than those observed here.&#13;
Using 1962 data from France, Vallini and Lery found mortality had a 30% ef-&#13;
fect on parity progression rates at second parity and 19% at Ciftho     Thus,&#13;
our results are more like those of modern France than those found by&#13;
Rutstein and Medica, but this may result from the multivaricte nature of&#13;
their analyses0&#13;
It is easier to understsnd the impact of previous mortality on&#13;
fertility if one looks not at parity progression ratios but at the addiÂ°&#13;
tional number of births0   Table 7 shows the difference in total additional&#13;
children ever born to women with different mortality experiences. For ex-&#13;

ample, the first entry for Bangladesh shows that women who have had 2 or&#13;
more children have an average of .44 fewer children if the first two sur-&#13;
vived than if the first survives and the second dies.      They have .40 fewer&#13;
than women whose first died and second survived and 1.01 fewer than those&#13;
whose first two died.     The differences are generally large, and in most&#13;
cases significant.    Only in Haiti, Sri Lanka, Paraguay and the Dominican&#13;
Republic is the pattern generally not significant.&#13;
These differences are not necessarily causally related to mortal-&#13;
ity however because both additional fertility and mortality experience may&#13;
be related to common factors such as age, education, socio-economic status&#13;
or residence.    Therefore, regression equations were used to estimate the&#13;
effect of mortality on additional births.     See Table 8)   At parity 2+, in&#13;
17 of 25 cases, both the death of the ith and ith-1 child has a significant&#13;
effect.   In an additional 5 the ith or i-lst child's death has a signifi-&#13;
cant effect.    Significance   is somewhat less at higher parities due, in&#13;
part, to smaller sample sizes.     The average effect of an infant death on&#13;
subsequent fertility in the regression is .48--larger than has been gener-&#13;
ally estimated in other studies where an effect of .20 to .33 is found and&#13;
in many cases the effect exceeds .5 larger than found in Preston, 1978.&#13;
The effect of infant mortality on additional fertility from the&#13;
regression equations can be compared with the effect of neonatal and post-&#13;
neonatal mortality on birth interval and therefore on births (Table 8).&#13;
Birth interval effects are estimated by dividing the effect of a death on a&#13;
birth interval obtained from weighted averages of regression coefficients&#13;
for parity 2 thru 6 by the average birth interval for surviving children.&#13;
This represents the lower bound of the effect for two reasons.       First the&#13;
birth interval for surviving infants is greater than the average interval&#13;

for all children.   Second the birth interval effect includes only the bio-&#13;
logical effect and effects of contraceptive use within the interval (spac-&#13;
ing), not the ultimate effect of infant mortality on contraceptive use to&#13;
terminate childbearing.&#13;
There is enormous variation from country to country in both esti-&#13;
mates of mortality's effect on fertility.     In all cases but two (Sri Lanka&#13;
and Jamaica) the estimates from added parity exceed those derived from&#13;
birth intervals.   Test of the relationship between the magnitude of mortal-&#13;
ity's effect on fertility showed little systematic association with country&#13;
characteristic such as GNP per capita, total fertility rates, infant mor-&#13;
tality rate, etc.    The only significant pattern found was that the effect&#13;
of post neo-natal mortality on fertility is larger the lower the level of&#13;
income, but the elasticity is small. Preston,s curvilinear pattern did not&#13;
emmerge. (Preston, 1975)&#13;
THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS FOR FERTILITY REDUCTION&#13;
There are some similar general issues involved in estimating the&#13;
fertility impact and cost of family planning and mortality reducing pro-&#13;
grams.  The general principle involved will first be reviewed, followed by&#13;
a separate discussion of the two estimation techniques.&#13;
The marginal cost of preventing a birth or preventing an infant&#13;
or child death is needed.    To obtain such figures it would be necessary to&#13;
separate capital from variable costs and have an estimate of how variable&#13;
costs change with level    of program activity.      Generally,  however, only&#13;
total cost and total clients or patients served are available.       Thus only&#13;
average cost per individual served can be calculated from existing statis-&#13;
tics.   This may be an inaccurate measure of marginal costs for several&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20 &#13;
reasons0   To the extent that capital costs are included, these costs twll&#13;
not necessarily increase if numbers served increases and to tins degree,&#13;
average costs may overestimate cost per clints cr patient0 X capital and&#13;
variable costs could be separated, a prolefi, may still arise if variable&#13;
costs are rising or falling0    If clients and patients in more remote areas&#13;
or who are more difficult to treat or recruit arz the marginal group, marg-&#13;
inal cost may well be rising and *average cost would tend to Lnderastimate&#13;
cost0  A final problem that exists is that of joint costso    If several ser-&#13;
vices are offered jointly it is extremely diffIcult t0 aliocaUt joint costs&#13;
to the appropriate activity.&#13;
All these factors would have to be c&amp;rofuly weighed in making&#13;
calculations to be used for actual policy miaking0     The cost figures used&#13;
below are not made with detailed cares,    ut were drawn from a wide variety&#13;
of sources to maximize the kinds of mortality and fertility environment&#13;
considered0   The cost per birth prevented fi.gures are average costs for&#13;
existing programs with all the problems of variable, capital and joint&#13;
costs0   Thus, there may be a tendency for the birth averted cost to be&#13;
somewhat too high on average relative to those for deaths averteZd0&#13;
Cost-Effectiveness of Family Planning Program&#13;
To determine the cost of a birth prevented from a family planning&#13;
program, one needs to determine the cost of the family planning program,&#13;
the number of users of various metiods from the program, the average length&#13;
of time for which methods are usedl and the fertility that users would have&#13;
had if no method were adoptedo2/&#13;
2/  In detailed analysis the cost 'gould Ge estimated separately by method0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
The United States Agency for International Development has&#13;
assembled estimates of the resources devoted to family planning programs&#13;
and the number of married women       in the population    in 1980.    Various&#13;
estimates exist of user rates for this period and these data can be&#13;
combined to get number of users and thus cost per user. (Table 9)&#13;
The costs per user varies substantially with a low of $4.88 in&#13;
Colombia to a high of $71.61 in Kenya.     Those countries with very low cost&#13;
per user correspond well to the countries that are known to be successes in&#13;
family planning (Colombia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, and Korea).&#13;
In some cases very high costs per user reflect the fact that&#13;
health expenditures are difficult to separate from family planning, but for&#13;
the outliers, Kenya and Nepal, even if we delete completely all host coun-&#13;
try contributions for which this problem arises, we still find very high&#13;
cost per user ($35 for Nepal and $49 for Kenya).&#13;
To translate cost per user into cost per birth averted, we need&#13;
to make assumptions about continuation rates and the fertility foregone by&#13;
those using contraception.    Here we have arbitrarily assumed each user has&#13;
one year of coverage3/. Data from WFS on age-specific fertility rates and&#13;
age specific user rates allow us to estimate births averted.       Two estima-&#13;
tions were made.    First, we assumed that users of efficient methods had&#13;
zero fertility and would have had the age specific fertility of the average&#13;
women if she had not used contraception. Using existing age specific mari-&#13;
tal fertility, the average births averted per user was calculated.          For&#13;
countries with low user rates the approximation is probably acceptable, but&#13;
for countries with high user rates this underestimates the births averted.&#13;
Therefore, a second technique was used whereby the existing age specific&#13;
3/   If one assumed average use of 1/2 year, then clearly costs per birth&#13;
Everted would be doubled.&#13;

marital fertility rate is increased by reducing the women at risk by a pro-&#13;
portion equal to the proportion using efficient methods.      The high and low&#13;
estimates of births averted are shown in Table 9 along with the correspond-&#13;
ing cost figures.&#13;
The costs per birth averted differ considerably between the two&#13;
techniques for high usage countries, Costa Rica and Panama being the clear-&#13;
est examples.    For low usage countries the values are very close.          By&#13;
either technique Nepal and Kenya are again outliers with costs considerably&#13;
in excess of any other country.&#13;
Cost per Birth Averted through Mortality Reduction&#13;
Data on cost per birth averted through family planning programs&#13;
are relatively straightforward because of the wealth of data on age-speci-&#13;
fic fertility and user rates as well as program costs. For calculating the&#13;
cost of a birth averted through a mortality reduction program, we find our-&#13;
selves with only limited data on both the cost of preventing a death and&#13;
the effect of a death averted on fertility.         In this section, we will&#13;
review the data available on the cost for averting a death and combine that&#13;
with data from the earlier section on births averted by averting an infant&#13;
death.&#13;
A number of papers have recently been prepared on the cost of&#13;
preventing a death for a number of developing countries.       These estimates&#13;
are summarized in Table 10. The costs vary widely depending on the type of&#13;
health intervention (preventive versus curative) and the estimation tech-&#13;
nique (see the range in the case of malaria).       The lowest cost estimates&#13;
come from the Narangwal program in India, and vaccination and immunization&#13;
programs in Morroco, and Kenya where for various programs the costs per&#13;

death averted is less than $100.     Overall the figures seem consistent with&#13;
the   Walsh and Warren estimates of the cost per infant and child death&#13;
averted from selective primary care intervention of between $200 and $250.&#13;
The cost per death averted depends on the level and pattern of infant and&#13;
child deaths in a country as well as the costs of delivering health care.&#13;
The highest costs are associated with the upper range of esti-&#13;
mates for malaria erradication in Bangladesh by Prescott and the Walsh and&#13;
Warren estimates of the impact of community water supply and sanitation.&#13;
Given the limited data on costs per death averted, we will make&#13;
calculations in all cases using Warren and Walsh estimates of $250 per&#13;
death averted.   This is a conservative estimate.    Where more specific data&#13;
is available, we will make several estimates for a country.      For all esti-&#13;
mates we will use the largest and smallest estimates for the births averted&#13;
by an averted death in Table 8.&#13;
Comparing Tables 9 and 11 we find in no case is the highest cost&#13;
per birth averted from family planning above the lowest cost birth averted&#13;
through mortality reduction using $250 as the cost of an averted death.&#13;
Using country specific cost we find that in Kenya measles vaccine as a free&#13;
standing program or an add-on program is considerably less than family&#13;
planning.   If one uses the lowest estimate of the effect of mortality on&#13;
fertility, then only a measles add-on program in Kenya is superior to&#13;
family planning for reducing fertility.&#13;
The results in Table 11 are very tentative, not only because of&#13;
the wide range on effects of mortality on fertility but because of the cost&#13;
of preventing deaths.     If the Narangwal program could be replicated with&#13;
costs as low as $25 per death averted, then a wide range of countries could&#13;

be added, then Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Korea, Jordan, Malaysia, Nepal,&#13;
Philippines, Pakistan, Panama and marginally Indonesia could be added to&#13;
Kenya as countries where mortality reduction could be a cost-effective way&#13;
to reduce fertility. Clearly, however, cost per death averted depends on&#13;
disease patterns.   Only the poorest, high mortality countries like Nepal&#13;
and Bangladesh and countries of West Africa have real potential for very&#13;
cheap mortality reduction.4/&#13;
Caveats&#13;
The cost-effectiveness analysis above was designed to illustrate&#13;
a fairly simple way of looking at the relationship between mortality and&#13;
fertility from a policy perspective.     But the world is not so simple and&#13;
the reservations one has about the above analysis, suggests where further&#13;
reseach is needed.&#13;
The above analysis makes no explicit adjustment for a limited&#13;
demand for contraception.    In some countries like Kenya, very few people&#13;
wish to limit fertility (more may wish to space). This means there are few&#13;
acceptors of the family planning which raises the cost per user and makes&#13;
mortality reduction appear more cost effective.     In other countries, how-&#13;
ever, the low demand for family planning may result in little program&#13;
effort and cost per acceptors might well appear to be low even if it would&#13;
require substantial   expenditure to increase usage.      This might easily&#13;
distort cost-effectiveness analysis.&#13;
In using cost-effectiveness analysis one must ask the question:&#13;
are financial resources the limiting factor?      If they are not, then one&#13;
4, Evans, Hall and Warford (1981) estimate $2 per capita for coverage of a&#13;
primary health care program, but to translate this into cost per death&#13;
averted one needs death rates. With a crude birth rate of 50 and an in-&#13;
fant mortality rate of 200, there would be 10 infant deaths per 1,000&#13;
population per year.   Even if the primary health program eliminated all&#13;
infant deaths but no other deaths, the cost per death averted would be&#13;
$200.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Â° 28&#13;
needs to look at the problem differently0   Xt may well be thar1  reducing in-&#13;
fant mortality is necessary to in:rease the demand for contraceptives, but&#13;
that this is not necessarily picked up by cost effectiveness analysis. To&#13;
address this issue one would need to do a more thorough analysis of contra-&#13;
ceptive use and non-use and the role played by mortality in this process.&#13;
This is a necessary further step in policy analysis of the effect of mor-&#13;
tality on fertility0&#13;
In addition, the question of ;he synergistic effect of mortality&#13;
and fertility reducing programs would have to examine the economies or dis-&#13;
economies that may arise in the supply of services as well as in the demand&#13;
for services.   This would require a separate literature review on delivery&#13;
systems.&#13;
Finally, the discussion above has been narrowly focused on the&#13;
cost effectiveness of family planning versus health prograns in reducing&#13;
fertility0   A more complete ana'ysis would require a comparison of these&#13;
with other programs such as education which affect fertility.&#13;
Summary and Conclusions&#13;
The estimates of the effect of infant mortality on fertility&#13;
reviewed in this paper show substantial variation across countries and by&#13;
the technique used0   The effect is lower for methods which depend on the&#13;
effect of mortality on birth intervals than for estimates of added births&#13;
following an infant death0   This is to be expected since birth intervals do&#13;
not take into consideration the effect of child loss on the decision to&#13;
limit rather than to space children with contraceptives0       The estimates&#13;
also differ by the technique used0 Estimation with regression gives higher&#13;
estimated effects than those de-ived from differences in means or median&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
birth intervals between those with surviving children and infant deaths.&#13;
The regression results seem more probably correct in that they control in-&#13;
directly for maternal health which would be correlated both with survival&#13;
and fecundity.&#13;
Overall, the estimates for births averted through the effects of&#13;
mortality on the birth interval are close to what is generally observed in&#13;
the literature.   The effects of a child death on subsequent fertility are&#13;
substantially higher than generally observed--about half a child on&#13;
average.   This may be due to the fact that regressions give a better&#13;
estimate of the true effect or to the better quality of WFS data than&#13;
earlier survey.'/&#13;
Even with the high estimates of the effect of an infant death on&#13;
fertility, we find only one clear case where reducing infant deaths appears&#13;
to be a more cost-effective way of reducing fertility than a family plan-&#13;
ning program. This case is Kenya. It may well be that if we had more sur-&#13;
vey data on the high mortality countries of West Africa, we might find a&#13;
number of other cases as well.     But country-specific policy making would&#13;
require more detailed cost analysis in each case and the cost analysis here&#13;
is only illustrative.&#13;
Cost-effectiveness analysis, however, implies simple tradeoffs&#13;
and either/or strategies.    In reality mortality and fertility interact in&#13;
far more complex ways which require more sophisticated analysis both of the&#13;
adoption of contraception and the delivery of health and family planning&#13;
services.&#13;
1/ Birth histories in WFS make a more complete count of births and deaths&#13;
probable.&#13;

            Infant and child mortality as a determinant
            of fertility : the policy implications
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Two conclusions can be drawn about the
            effect of infant and child mortality on the number of
            births. First, for women who breastfeed their children an
            infant death reduces the interval between births (in the
            absence of contraception). Second, there will tend to be
            more births if infant deaths occur from the first few
            births. The estimates reported show substantial variation
            across countries and by technique used. There may be
            externalities or societal changes operating over the long
            run that require more sophisticated analysis. This paper
            presents a comparison between the cost of averting a birth
            through a family planning program and the cost of averting a
            birth indirectly by preventing an infant death. Of the 16
            countries studies, Kenya, which has a high mortality rate,
            was the one case where mortality reduction was more cost
            effective than family planning.
