ABSTRACT&#13;
Narangwal is more than the name of a village In Punjab, India. It has become&#13;
associated with one of the best known and well documented field experiments in&#13;
health care and family planning anywhere in the world. In that experiment,&#13;
groups of villages were provided with combinations of services for health,&#13;
family planning, and nutrition between 1968 and 1974. The households in each&#13;
group were then followed through extensive data gathering. The World Bank has&#13;
been collaborating with Johns Hopkins University in analyzing this rich set of&#13;
data to study policy questions relating to systems for the delivery of&#13;
services. Two monographs on the findings of this research--one dealing with&#13;
population, one with nutrition--are forthcoming.&#13;
One important question addressed in the population monograph is whether the&#13;
integration of health and family planning services helps in attaLning family&#13;
planning and health objectives. This paper focuses on the findings on this&#13;
question.&#13;
The findings show that integration was more effective in recruiting family&#13;
planning acceptors than was the provision of family planning alone. They also&#13;
show that integration was more cost effective than separate services and more&#13;
equitable in distributing family planning services to all socioeconomic&#13;
groups. Integration also produced better contraceptive protection.&#13;
These results were not obtained by sacrificing health benefits. The findings&#13;
show that health benefits were also impressive--in effectiveness, in effi-&#13;
ciency, and in equLty.&#13;
The life of the experiment was too short to produce a perceptible fertility&#13;
decline, yet the results generally suggest that integration can help in&#13;
reducing fertility, too.&#13;

INTEGRATING FAMILY PLANNING WITH HEALTH SERVICES:&#13;
DOES IT HELP?&#13;
Whether family planning and health services should be integrated to increase&#13;
the effectiveness of family planning services is no longer a subject of&#13;
debate. Most countries and international agencies favor integration because&#13;
of the efficiency of using health personnel for family planning. But it still&#13;
is important to ask, does integration increase the impact of services? The&#13;
question can be addressed by studying the experience of a controlled experi-&#13;
ment at Narangwal in the Indian state of Punjab.     The Department of Interna-&#13;
tional Health of Johns Hopkins IJniversity conducted a field experiment there&#13;
between 1968 and 1974. In that experiment, different groups of villages were&#13;
provided with different combinations of services for health, nutrition, and&#13;
family planning. The experiment had two parts. The population study examined&#13;
the outcome of integrating health services with those for family planning.&#13;
The nutrition study considered the interaction between malnutrition and infec-&#13;
tions in children under three years of age.&#13;
Timothy King gave the valuable comments on an earlier draft of this paper,&#13;
which is     drawn from Carl Taylor, Rashid Faruqee, Robert Parker, William&#13;
Reinke and R.S.S. Sarma, Benefits of Integrating Family Planning and Health&#13;
Services: the Narangwal Experience (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, forth-&#13;
coming). That source contains the details of the experimental design,&#13;
services, and findings.&#13;

In the population study, five experimental groups of villages were&#13;
matched as closely as possible for comparability. Each group of villages&#13;
received a different service package:&#13;
10   Family planning, women's services, and child care services (FPWSCC)&#13;
2.   Family planning and women's services (FPWS)o&#13;
3.   Family planning and child care services (FPCC).&#13;
4.   Family planning and family planning education services (FPED)0&#13;
5.   Control group (CONT-P).&#13;
In the nutrition study, which covered all children under three, each of four&#13;
groups of villages received a different service package:&#13;
10   Child care services:   nutritional supplementation, and health care&#13;
(NUTHC)o&#13;
2.   Nutritional supplementation (NUT)0&#13;
3.   Health care (HC)0&#13;
4.   Control group (CONT-N)&#13;
The NUTHC experimental group was the FPCC group of the population study (see&#13;
figure 1).&#13;
Description of Services and Variables&#13;
As services developed in the course of the experiment, care was taken to&#13;
ensure that the intensity of services in each experimental group was roughly&#13;
the same0 The project services are summarized in table 10 Never static, the&#13;
services continued to evolve, so that activities would become more relevant&#13;
and realistic0 Services did not start at the same time in all experimental&#13;
groups; this complicated the analysis, as will be noted later0&#13;

The project services can be described as follows:&#13;
o    Women's illness care, which included visits or contacts related to&#13;
women's illnesses usually initiated by ill women or their families&#13;
and most often occurring in the village clinic.&#13;
o    Women's other care, which included contacts initiated by project&#13;
health workers through routine home visits to women for fertility&#13;
surveillance, health education, family planning motivation, and&#13;
preventive care.&#13;
o    Children' illness care, which included visits or contacts for&#13;
curative purposes to children of women in the study villages, usually&#13;
at family initiative and in the village clinic.&#13;
o    Children's other care, which included routine contacts initiated by&#13;
project health workers for prevention and surveillance (but including&#13;
early diagnosis and treatment in the home) for children of women in&#13;
the study villages.&#13;
o    Family planning services and follow-up, which included contacts with&#13;
both women and men involving the provision of modern family planning&#13;
methods or the follow-up of users.&#13;
o    Family planning motivation, which included contacts by male family&#13;
planning workers with husbands of women in the study villages (these&#13;
contacts involved general rapport generating activities, health&#13;
related advice, specific family planning and population education,&#13;
and motivation to use contraceptives)0&#13;
The first two categories constituted women's services (WS), the second two&#13;
children's services (CC), and the third two family planning (FP) and family&#13;
planning education (ED).&#13;

Education and motivation          Intense educational efforts were provided in&#13;
FPED villages; education was well integrated&#13;
with health care delivery in FPWSCC and FPWS&#13;
villages, and less adequately integrated in&#13;
FPCC villages.&#13;
Contraceptive services            Condoms, pills, IUDs, injectable Depo-&#13;
provera, vasectomies, and tubectomies were&#13;
provided under similar conditions in all&#13;
experimental groups.&#13;
Follow-up                         The same method-specific patterns of&#13;
follow-up were established for all groups.&#13;

Periodic health surveillance      Weekly monitoring of morbidity status in&#13;
and education to three years      FPCC villages, much less frequent (about&#13;
every two months) home visiting in FPWSCC&#13;
villages.&#13;
Periodic measurement of           Routine ranged from every month for&#13;
weight and height                 infants to every three months at three&#13;
years of age for FPWSCC and FPCC villages.&#13;
Immunization                      Routine smallpox, OPT, BCG, polio, and&#13;
measles in FPWSCC and FPCC villages.&#13;
Nutrition supplementation         Selective provision of supplements to mal-&#13;
and education                     nourished or faltering children, and&#13;
education of mothers of all children in&#13;
FPWSCC and FPCC villages.&#13;
Diagnosis, treatment, and         Early care emphasized in FPWSCC and FPCC&#13;
referral of illness               villages.&#13;
Note: All services in the health care villages were provided by family health&#13;
workers, who were auxiliary nurse-midwives with two years' hospital&#13;
training beyond high school plus an intensive six to eight weeks re-&#13;
training period in the project. They were supervised on weekly visits&#13;
by a doctor and by a public health nurse or lady health visitor.&#13;
Family planning educators were the peripheral workers in the FPED&#13;
villages. They were village teachers whose training and supervision&#13;
paralleled the level and intensity of the family health workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
A large number of input-output-outcome variables were measured in the&#13;
many surveys and studies during the project. Detailed data on services were&#13;
collected to provide a basis for using quantitative measures of services as&#13;
independent variables in input-output-outcome analysis and for detailed&#13;
studies of cost-effectiveness. To identify the background factors that&#13;
lnfluenced project results, many variables were measured. The variables can&#13;
be categorized as follows: i) demographic; ii) socioeconomic; iii) attitudes&#13;
and beliefs; iv) family planning knowledge and practice; v) fertility and&#13;
mortality; and vi) morbidity and growth of children.&#13;
In evaluating the benefits of integration, three outcomes of the ex-&#13;
periment were examined: the use of family planning, selected indicators of&#13;
health, and the decline in fertility0 Three criteria were used to assess the&#13;
value of services: effectiveness, efficiency, and equity0 Effectiveness was&#13;
judged by looking at the outcome: for example, whether integrated health and&#13;
family planning services increased the use of family planning without sacri-&#13;
ficing health benefits0 I/ Efficiency cost-effectiveness was judged by re-&#13;
lating outcome to input, equity by examining the dtstribution of services&#13;
among socioeconomic groups.&#13;
The results of the Narangwal experience are summed up in the follow-&#13;
ing table0&#13;
1/ Outcome and output can be defined in many ways0 Reduced Infant mortality&#13;
or fertility are the ultimate outcomes of project services, but there are&#13;
also such lntermedLate variables as the number and duration of service&#13;
contacts0 .Similarly, input can be measured in many ways0     Here It is&#13;
defined as the time of the personnel and the cost of services0 Note that&#13;
no attempt is made to distinguish the quality of output on the basis of&#13;
whether services are provided separately or in combination with others0&#13;
Nor is the quality of a unit of output distinguished on the basis of who&#13;
uses it0&#13;

I turn now to the results.&#13;
Use of Family Planning&#13;
The experience of many developed countries shows that with socioeconomic&#13;
development, there is a decline in fertility because of the greater use of&#13;
family planning. This does not mean that a fertility decline is possible only&#13;
through socioeconomic development. Recent experience in China, Sri Lanka, and&#13;
in the Indian state of Kerala shows that a country can achieve a substantial&#13;
fertility decline by intervening with family planning programs, even without&#13;
reaching higher income levels. But socioeconomic development alone will not&#13;
increase the use of family planning programs. It is therefore important for&#13;
policymakers to know what kinds of services and what approaches to the&#13;
delivery of services will increase the use of family planning.&#13;
Effectiveness&#13;
The effectiveness of integrated services in increasing the use of&#13;
family planning was looked at in four ways. The first was to observe changes&#13;
in the use of both modern and traditional methods during the project (the&#13;
ever-use rate). This would not exactly capture how much of the change was&#13;
contributed by the project, which only provided modern methods. So, the second&#13;
was to observe only the increases in the use of modern methods (the new-&#13;
acceptor rate of modern method). Acceptance rates do not capture the&#13;
continuation of use. Therefore, the third was to observe changes in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
proportion of women contracepting (the continuing-use rate) at a given point&#13;
of time. The fourth was to observe changes in the methods of contraception&#13;
(the effective-use rate). -&#13;
Acceptors of project contraception fall into three categories: those&#13;
who had used modern contraceptives, those who had used traditional methods of&#13;
contraception, and those who had not used contraception. The distinctions are&#13;
important because they show how great an effect the project had. For example,&#13;
the biggest shift in use was from nonuse before the project to the use of&#13;
modern methods under the project; the smallest, from prior use of modern&#13;
methods to the use of modern methods under the project0 The second was merely&#13;
a shift in the source of supply, but it may also have been a shift to more&#13;
effective methods0&#13;
A comparison of preproject use of permanent, temporary, and tradi-&#13;
tional methods of family planning is shown for the four experimental groups in&#13;
table 20 Considering both modern and indigenous methods, the ever-use rates&#13;
were similar in the villages where family planning services were offered (49.4&#13;
percent of eligible women, that is, married women in the age group 15-49) and&#13;
in those where no family planning services were offered (52 percent of&#13;
eligible women)0 The ever-use rates in the four experimental groups ranged&#13;
from 46.4 to 51.2 percent, but the differences were not significant0&#13;
The overall preproject use of modern methods was 17.6 percent of&#13;
eligible women but varied greatly among the four groups:     the ever-use rate of&#13;
modern methods was 26.0 percent in the FPED group, 19.1 percent in the FPWS&#13;
group, 1801 percent in the control group, 1109 percent in the FPCC group, and&#13;
11.7 percent in the FPWSCC group0 Modern contraceptives accounted for about&#13;
half the prior contraception in the FPED group and more thAn a third in the&#13;
FPWS group and control groups0 In the FPWSCC and FPCC groups, modern&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

contraception was used by only a fourth of those who had practiced family&#13;
planning, and the use of traditional methods was correspondingly greater.&#13;
Thus, if the prior use of family planning is considered with its mix of&#13;
contraceptives, the biggest impact is expected in the FPWSCC and FPCC groups,&#13;
followed by the FPWS group. The least is expected from the FPED group.&#13;

In Narangwal villages during the project, the acceptance (ever-use)&#13;
rates of modern family planning methods rose to between 51 and 54 percent of&#13;
eligible women (see figure 2). Those in FPCC and FPED villages rose to 45 and&#13;
37 percent. These increases relate to all acceptors.&#13;
A better indicator of the effect of the project is the new-acceptor&#13;
rate--for those who used modern methods for the first time as a result of&#13;
project activities. Cumulative new acceptor rates in FPWSCC, FPWS, FPCC, and&#13;
FPED villages respectively were 45 percent, 42 percent, 39 percent and 22&#13;
percent by the end of the project (see figure 3). In comparing these rates,&#13;
one has to bear in mind that services started at different times in the&#13;

different service groups; FPED services, for example, started nearly two and a&#13;
half years later than FPWSCC services. These rates are useful, however, to&#13;
indicate the trend of project acceptance rate and they somewhat modify the&#13;
picture in figure 2. Cumulative project acceptor rates show that although the&#13;
overall acceptor rates were higher in FPWS villages than in FPWSCC villages,&#13;
the present acceptor rates were higher in the FPWSCC villages. In addition,&#13;
the gap between the curves for FPCC and FPED villages, which widened during&#13;
the project period in figure 2, remained essentially the same in figure 3.&#13;
The much greater source-substitution by prior users in FPWS and FPED villages&#13;
accounts for the differences between figure 2 and figure 3. Figure 3 more&#13;
accurately portrays the project results. 1/&#13;
Figure 3 shows that acceptance curves in all the four groups of&#13;
villages are roughly parallel, implying that the project succeeded in getting&#13;
couples to start contraception more or less at the same rate in all the&#13;
experimental groups. More important, however, is a comparison of trends in&#13;
continuing-use rates, measured by the proportion of eligible women practicing&#13;
contraception at a given time. Ftgure 4 presents the fluctuating continuing-&#13;
use rates in the four experimental groups. A trend line (constructed by&#13;
fitting quadratic equations to smooth the curves) shows a somewhat different&#13;
picture (see figure 5). The smoothed curves show that in all the experimental&#13;
groups except FPCC, the practice rates were still rising. However, the rate&#13;
of rise in FPED villages was considerably slower. In FPCC villages, even a&#13;
decline in the practice rate seemed to have started. One possible reason for&#13;
the observed trend in FPCC villages is that there may be a lag period between&#13;
1/ These results at Narangwal are comparable with the achievements in family&#13;
planning by other experiments and special projects in India.&#13;

the use of services and a rise in family planning (because it would take time&#13;
for the reduced infant and child mortality to have an effect on desired family&#13;
size).&#13;
The demographic impact of family planning depends on what kinds of&#13;
contraceptives are used. 1/ Obviously, the use of condoms or pills cannot be&#13;
as effective as sterilization. So, further adjustments in contraceptive prac-&#13;
tice rates are needed. The mix of contraceptives differed greatly for the&#13;
four experimental groups and changed from beginning to the end (see table 3).&#13;
Toward the end of the project (1974) almost half those practicing contracep-&#13;
tion in FPED group were still only using condoms. At the other extreme, more&#13;
than 40 percent of those practicing contraception at the end of the project in&#13;
FPCC group were sterilized. The expectations for demographic impact thus are&#13;
reduced for the FPED group and increased for the FPCC group. The continuing-&#13;
use rates were adjusted for effectiveness of the methods to give effective-use&#13;
rates (see figure 6). In general, the integration of family planning and&#13;
health services helped in the movement from less effective methods to more&#13;
effective methods.&#13;
To be considered next is the effect of the various health services on&#13;
the practice of family planning. This is best done by reviewing results among&#13;
the different categories of prior practice of family planning. Because prior&#13;
nonusers of family planning started with the zero practice rates, they showed&#13;
the greatest increases in family planning practices. Children's other&#13;
services tripled the use of modern methods by prior users of traditional&#13;
1/ The relative effectiveness of various methods (measured by the pregnancy&#13;
rate of noncontracepting women) was measured as follows: condom, 34 per-&#13;
cent; oral pills, 28 percent; tubectomy, 97 percent.&#13;

methods0 1/  No significant effect was observed among prior users of modern&#13;
methods0 Similar but less dramatic effects were observed for women's other&#13;
services0 Children's illness care more than doubled family planning practice&#13;
rates among prior nonusers. Effects less dramatic but still significant were&#13;
observed for both children's and women's illness care for other categories of&#13;
use0 In contrast with other care, illness care for both women and children&#13;
produced a significant increase in the practice of family planning by prior&#13;
users of modern methods0 Because these other services were more project-&#13;
initiated than patient-initiated, the results indicate that services have the&#13;
potential of being targeted on those who have never used family planning or&#13;
who have used only traditional methods0 People with prior experience of&#13;
family planning tended to respond spontaneously to the availability of family&#13;
planning and health services; therefore, project initiative seemed to be less&#13;
important for them, and illness care had the greater impact0&#13;

The project-initiated other services for surveillance and prevention&#13;
had much more universal coverage and showed less of a direct concurrent rela-&#13;
tion with the use of family planning than did illness services. The only&#13;
apparent association was that new recruits to family planning late in the pro-&#13;
ject seem to have received (somewhat) more children's other services during&#13;
the period of successful recruitment to family planning. A converse rela-&#13;
tion--early acceptance of family planning leading to greater use of health&#13;
services--was not demonstrated.&#13;
A regression model was used to assess the net effect of services on&#13;
contraceptive practice. Table 4 presents the results0 The coefficients in&#13;
the regression equation are small because service inputs are expressed as&#13;
individual contacts0 The coefficients can be interpreted as approximate in-&#13;
creases in the percentage of contraceptive users in the population given an&#13;
increased input of one unit (contact or visit) of service per woman0 In this&#13;
context, one contact with women's other services is seen to have almost nine&#13;
times the effect of one contact with children's other services; a visit for&#13;
women's illness services is about twice as effective as a visit for child's&#13;
illness services0&#13;
But when the effect of services is examined in relation to the mean&#13;
number of services received, the picture is somewhat different (table 5). If&#13;
the coefficient for each service variable is multiplied by the mean number of&#13;
service contacts, the effect of children's other services in the project is&#13;
shown to be as strong as women's illness services, but still not as strong as&#13;
women's other services0 Women's other services were assocLated with a 14.4&#13;
percent increase in the probability of accepting family planning, compared&#13;

with an increase of somewhat less than 5 percent associated with women's&#13;
illness and children's other services. In this case the relative importance&#13;
of the variables in explaining differences in contraceptive use is about the&#13;
same as the ranking of the "t" values (table 4) and the beta coefficients,&#13;
normalized coefficients that take into account differences in standard&#13;
deviations of the variables (see also table 5).&#13;
Di ;'tn: Combined and integrated services for health and family&#13;
planning were more effective in getting women to practice family planrilig than&#13;
were services for family planning alone. But integrated services (FPWSCC)&#13;
were less effective than one of the two combined services (FPWS). Of the&#13;
health services, women's services were more effective than children's services&#13;
in getting women to practice family planning. That may explain why the&#13;
services in FPWS villages were more effective than those in FPWSCC villages.&#13;
Efficiency&#13;
Integrated health and family planning services at Narangwal were&#13;
efficient because, by combining various activities in a single visit,&#13;
economies were significant in both time and money. In addition, because the&#13;
combinations made sense in the village home, there appeared to be more rapport&#13;
and greater changes in behavior.&#13;
By the last year of the project (1974) the input of family planning&#13;
workers and family planning educators averaged six to eight hours of direct&#13;
service time a week. For family planning activities the weekly distribution&#13;
of time was 37 minutes in FPWSCC villages; 57 minutes in FPCC villages; 83&#13;
minutes in FPWS villages; and 249 minutes in FPED villages. The time taken to&#13;
maintain friendly relations and rapport took 113 minutes in FPED villages,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
compared with 43-49 minutes by family health workers in the other experimental&#13;
villages. Further evidence on the relative increase in efficiency is provided&#13;
by the time per average service contact in 1973-74, which was shortest where&#13;
integration was greatest: 4.4 minutes in FPWSCC villages; 5.7 minutes in FPWS&#13;
villages and FPCC villages; 14.3 minutes in FPED villages. When time per&#13;
family planning contact was estimated separately, the averages were found to&#13;
be about 4 minutes in FPWSCC villages, 8 minutes in FPWS villages, 19 minutes&#13;
in FPCC villages, and 16 minutes in FPED villages.&#13;
What was the relative cost-effectiveness of different service&#13;
packages? The cost per new family planning acceptor was $12.27 in FPWSCC&#13;
villages, twice that amount in FPWS villages, three times that amount in FPCC&#13;
and FPED villages. The cost per couple-year family planning was $1027 in&#13;
FPWSCC villages, 1.7 times that amount in FPWS villages, 2.5 times that amount&#13;
in FPCC villages, and three times that amount in FPED villages0 The cost per&#13;
family planning contact was $051 in FPWSCC villages, $077 in FPWS villages,&#13;
$1.45 in FPED villages, and $1.92 in FPCC villages0 The cost in FPWSCC&#13;
villages approached the 1968-69 cost per family planning contact in the&#13;
government's primary health centers ($033).&#13;
One explanation for the FPCC contacts being least efficient is that&#13;
family planning services in these villages were started several years after&#13;
child care services had been well established, thus requiring a big&#13;
readjustment in the work patterns of family health workers0 It appears that&#13;
child care services will be always somewhat more difficult to Integrate with&#13;
family planning services than with women's services0 But when family planning&#13;
was combined with both women's and children's services, family health workers&#13;
made much more efficient use of their work time.&#13;

Equity&#13;
There were significant differences in preproject rates of ever-use of&#13;
modern contraceptives among religion-caste groups, among education groups,&#13;
among occupation groups, among age groups, and among family-size groups (table&#13;
6). The general pattern was that people of higher caste, higher education,&#13;
higher occupation, and larger family size groups had greater rates of&#13;
contraceptive use. The group aged 25-34 had the highest rate, the group under&#13;
twenty-five the lowest.&#13;
The differences in rates of contraceptive use during the project&#13;
became less significant than the differences in preproject use. The exception&#13;
was the age of wife: there was a reversal of the difference between the&#13;
youngest (under twenty-five) and the oldest (over thirty-five). The reversal,&#13;
which was demographically more advantageous, was so great that the age&#13;
difference became even more significant than the preproject difference.&#13;
Couples recruited by the project were from three prior-use&#13;
categories: users of traditional methods, users of modern methods, and&#13;
nonusers. There were no socioeconomic differences in acceptors recruited from&#13;
preproject users of traditional methods and of modern methods. More important&#13;
than eliminating differences in the recruitment of prior users was narrowing&#13;
differences among new recruits.&#13;
The sociodemographic characteristics of new recruits were distinctly&#13;
different from those of preproject users: the low-caste group had a&#13;
recruitment rate greater than did the high-caste group. Differences by the&#13;
occuipation of the husband, highly significant for preproject users, were&#13;
eliminated. Education of husband maintained the same pattern of distribution&#13;
as that for preproject users, with higher education being associated with&#13;

higher family planning rates but at considerably lower levels of&#13;
significance. In contrast to preproject users, who mainly were older women,&#13;
the project was able to get fresh acceptors at a considerably higher rate from&#13;
among women under thirty-five. Only about 20 percent of the women over&#13;
thirty-five became users of family planning for the first time; but about 46&#13;
percent of women under thirty-five did. The relation between preproject use&#13;
and number of living children was significant. In contrast, fresh recruitment&#13;
ranged from 33.5 percent for couples with six or more children to 38.4 for&#13;
couples with three to five children.&#13;
Use of Health Services&#13;
The integration of family planning with health services increased the&#13;
efficient and equitable use of family planning. These results in family&#13;
planning were not obtained by sacrificing health benefits. The findings show&#13;
that health benefits were substantial and commensurate with the health&#13;
services provided.&#13;
Effectiveness&#13;
The effectiveness of integrated services in improving health was&#13;
examined by observing changes in the mortality, morbidity, and growth of&#13;
children under the different packages of services. At Narangwal, the death&#13;
rate of children under three years of age was analyzed because the children's&#13;
health services were largely concentrated on children of that age. Changes in&#13;
maternal mortality rates would have been an important measure of the effec-&#13;
tiveness of women's health services, but the analysis of maternal mortality&#13;
was not feasible because of there being few maternal deaths.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Rates were calculated for stillbirths, infant mortality (neonatal&#13;
under one month and postneonatal from 1 to 12 months), and children's deaths&#13;
between one and three years of age (see table 7). The stillbirth rate roughly&#13;
measures the probable effect on the fetus of prenatal care for the mother,&#13;
especially the effect of providing iron, folic acid, and tetanus toxoid to all&#13;
mothers and nutritional supplementation to poorly nourished mothers. 1/ This&#13;
rate was 57 per 1,000 live and still births in the control villages and was 23&#13;
to 35 percent lower in the villages with services.&#13;
The effects of services on still births were comparable for the low-&#13;
caste group in both FPWSCC and FPCC villages. Only in the FPCC villages was&#13;
there some effect among the high-caste families. This possibly implies that&#13;
the more intensive child care services in FPCC villages covered all caste&#13;
groups, and that workers in FPWSCC villages, with less available time, may&#13;
have concentrated their prenatal care efforts on low-caste mothers. It also&#13;
is likely that low-caste mothers accepted supplementation more readily than&#13;
high-caste mothers in FPWSCC villages0&#13;
Infant mortality rates were disaggregated into neonatal death rates&#13;
(for the first month of life) and postneonatal death rates (for the next&#13;
eleven months)0 The difference in the neonatal death rates was significant:&#13;
the rate was 78 per 1,000 live births in control villages, 64 in FPWSCC&#13;
villages, and 47 in FPCC villages0 This variable also differed by caste0 In&#13;
neonatal suvrival rates, the high-caste children in FPWSCC villages were&#13;
affected by the services, but the low-caste children were not0 This contrasts&#13;
1/ Full prenatal and postnatal care were provided in FPWSCC and FPWS&#13;
villages; modified prenatal care was provided in FPCC villages to protect&#13;
the child. See table 10&#13;

sharply with the results for still bLrths, for which prenatal care is critical&#13;
and the prenatal care could have been provided to low caste in FPWSCCo      As for&#13;
the neonatal death rate, In villages where services were less intensive in&#13;
their outreach (FPWSCC), high-caste families perhaps sought care from the pro-&#13;
ject or other sources, and neonatal mortality was moderately reduced. Low-&#13;
caste children were significantly affected by services in FPCC villages, show-&#13;
ing a reduction of 43 percent in the neonatal death rate. In FPCC villages,&#13;
home visits were much more intensive (weekly, compared with monthly or bi-&#13;
monthly visits in FPWSCC villages after the immediate postpartum period).&#13;
Basically the same pattern held for children in the postneonatal period, with&#13;
high-caste children in FPWSCC villages and all children in FPCC villages being&#13;
significantly affected by the child care services.&#13;
Although there were fewer deaths among children aged 1-3, the effect&#13;
of services on these deaths was as important as it was in deaths at an earlier&#13;
age. The mortality rates for children aged 1-3 in FPWSCC and FPCC villages&#13;
were 7 and 13 per 1,000 children, compared with 19 in control villages. The&#13;
effect was greatest in FPWSCC villages, which had a mortality rate 63 percent&#13;
lower for this age group than controls, but services for this population had&#13;
an equal effect on all castes. Interestingly, services for older children in&#13;
FPCC villages had no effect on high-caste children0 This may reflect that the&#13;
high-caste older children did not participate in the nutrition supplementation&#13;
program0&#13;
To measure morbidity at Narangwal, FPCC and control villages were&#13;
surveyed weekly0 The morbidity indicator is the average duration of episodes&#13;
of seven illness:   fever, cough, pneumonia, diarrhea, vomiting, eye infection,&#13;
and skin infection0 These were selected because of their frequency and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
importance for children under three. For each illness, the average duration&#13;
was less in the FPCC villages than in the control villages (see table 8). The&#13;
differences ranged from 14 to 33 percent.&#13;
The measures were further refined. The total annual days of illness&#13;
per chtld were estimated for infants under one and for children aged 1-3 by&#13;
using the duration and average incidence rates for each illness.      The analyses&#13;
show that services in FPCC villages reduced the amount of illness by twenty-&#13;
two days a year in each group (table 8): the reductions were 16 percent for&#13;
those under a year and 21 percent for those aged 1-3.&#13;
The differences in another indicator of effectiveness of child health&#13;
services--child growth--were also significant. Growth increased dramatically,&#13;
with average weight dLfferences of 0.5 kilogram and height differences of 2&#13;
centimeters between children in study villages and control villages. The&#13;
effect of sex and caste on growth added to the effects of project services:&#13;
high-caste male child from a study village was 2 kilograms heavier and 6&#13;
centimeters taller at age three than a low-caste female child from a control&#13;
village. The number of living siblings also added to the effect:     a child with&#13;
two male and two female siblings was on the average 0.5 kilograms lighter than&#13;
a child with one living brother or none. This is a powerful argument for the&#13;
health benefits of family planning.&#13;

The efficiency of health services at Narangwal was measured by&#13;
service contacts per capita, by the time spent per service contact, by the&#13;
service cost per capita, and by the cost per service contact. The integrated&#13;
services in FPWSCC villages generated more contacts than those in FPCC&#13;

villages. The different patterns of time inputs and service contacts were&#13;
compared by calculating the average time per contact. In 1971 the average&#13;
time per contact in FPWSCC villages was 5.4 minutes. This figure combines all&#13;
services in the home and clinic into one average. The corresponding averages&#13;
were 6.9 minutes in FPWS villages and 7.6 minutes in FPCC villages.      The&#13;
greater efficiency of the integrated services Is indicated by the averages for&#13;
child care: 4.6 minutes per contact in FPWSCC villages, where they were&#13;
combined with women's services, but 6.7 minutes in FPCC villages. Another&#13;
fact contributing to the differences in child care services between FPWSCC and&#13;
FPCC villages was the greater use of home visiting, which required more time&#13;
per contact in FPCC villages.&#13;
For both women's services and child care, the costs per capita in&#13;
FPWSCC villages were consistently lower than in FPWS and FPCC villages&#13;
indicating the greater efficiency of integrated services (table 9). The&#13;
average annual cost of children's services was $0.56 per capita in FPWSCC&#13;
villages and $1.07 in FPCC villages. This difference is another indication of&#13;
the difference in intensity of surveillance in the two experimental groups.&#13;
Nutritional supplementation, primarily oE children aged 1-3, also cost more in&#13;
FPCC villages ($0.87 per capita) than in FPWSCC villages ($0.60 per capita).&#13;
The cost of women's services other than maternity care was $0.60 in FPWSCC&#13;
villages and $0.88 in FPWS villages; that of maternity care was $0.23 and&#13;
$0.43 for these two experimental groups.    The cost per capita of limited&#13;
services to women in FPCC villages was much less.&#13;
Table 9 also shows the cost per service contact. The cost per unit&#13;
of service for children's and women's services at Narangwal ranged from $0.19&#13;

to $0.36; the cost in government primary health centers in 1968-69 was $0.21&#13;
per patient visit and $0.13 per maternal-and-child-health contact. There were&#13;
major differences in the achievements of Narangwal and those of primary health&#13;
center services, but the costs per contact for both services were remarkably&#13;
close.&#13;
Despite government and project expenditure on health care services,&#13;
the villagers still spent a large amount of money on private health care.&#13;
Information on such out-of-pocket spending was collected during the sample&#13;
household survey and combined wtth data on project and government expenditure&#13;
to estimate total expenditure on health care per capita in project villages,&#13;
including control areas. The findings in table 9 show that the provision of&#13;
project services permitted a reduction in the amount of money spent on health&#13;
care by the villagers and by the government. Nonproject health care expendi-&#13;
ture was $1.96 in FPWSCC villages, which had the most project services,&#13;
compared with $2.96 in control villages and $3.51 in FPED villages, which had&#13;
no project health care services. When the second two amounts are compared&#13;
with the expenditure per capita (project and nonproject) in FPWSCC villages,&#13;
it is clear that introducing the comprehensive package of women's and&#13;
children's services (excluding nutrition) in Punjab villages cost only&#13;
slightly more than the existing pattern of government and private services--&#13;
$3.59 per capita a year, compared with $2.96 and $3.51. In contrast, the&#13;
total expenditure on each of the other service packages--FPWS, FPCC, and&#13;
FPED--shows them to be somewhat more expensive alternatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Equity&#13;
Surveys conducted before the project demonstrated a significant&#13;
direct relation between income and the use of health services. Low-income&#13;
people used health services less than high-income people. Narangwal services&#13;
were designed, however, for all people in the study villages, with special&#13;
concern for those in the greatest need. It was therefore important to find&#13;
out whetlher the Narangwal project overcame preexLsting disparities and&#13;
improved equity in the use of project services.&#13;
The use of services was categorized in three ways: no use during the&#13;
project, use early (1969-71) or late (1972-73) in the project, and use&#13;
throughout the project0 The families were characterized by socioeconomic&#13;
measures, including caste, income, ownership of land, education of husband or&#13;
father, and the possesston of radios, bicycles, or sewing machines. The&#13;
project services attracted all types of women and children almost equally0&#13;
Women from land-owning families and those whose husbands were better educated&#13;
used women's illness services significantly more than other women0 Other than&#13;
that, there were no significant differences in use between different socio-&#13;
economic groups0 But there was a small, consistent trend for women of higher&#13;
socioeconomic status and children of lower socioeconomic status (except for&#13;
education) to use services more0&#13;
Cross-sectional household surveys measuring the use of different&#13;
sources of care also confirmed the equitable distribution of project curative&#13;
services and the removal of disparities between women and children of high&#13;
caste and those of low caste0 The data from these surveys showed that 38&#13;
percent of the illnesses of high-caste children were treated by project&#13;
personnel, compared with 39 percent of those of low-caste children0 Among&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
women the proportion of illnesses receiving project services was 28 percent&#13;
for high-caste families and 29 percent for low-caste families. But Ln project&#13;
villages, high-caste families (20 percent) continued to use outside sources of&#13;
services much more than low-caste families (7 percent), producing a use rate&#13;
significantly higher for high-caste children (56 percent) than for low-caste&#13;
children (45 percent). Thus project services in many cases tended to supple-&#13;
ment outside sources of care for high-caste children, but they substituted for&#13;
most outside sources for low-caste children. The pattern of displacement of&#13;
other sources of care by project services among high-caste woman and low-caste&#13;
women was similar to that observed in their children. The data therefore&#13;
indicate that the project delivered services equitably, but that the demand&#13;
for continued use of other sources of care varied significantly by socio-&#13;
economic level.&#13;
The provision of curative services required a visit to the family&#13;
health worker's village clinic and were mainly initiated by patients. Most&#13;
services other than curative services were initiated by the project. They&#13;
included prevention and surveillance, usually in the home. Except [or&#13;
differences by caste, the proportion of women using these services varied&#13;
slightly but not significantly by socioeconomic classification. In general, a&#13;
greater proportion of low-caste women used them, making these even more&#13;
equitable than curative services.&#13;
To sum up: The use of curative services was essentially equalized&#13;
for the different socioeconomic groups. It appears that the provision of&#13;
curative services by the Narangwal project made it possible for the low-caste&#13;
group to shift to project services while the high-caste group continued to use&#13;
private services, but the disparity in total use of the services by caste was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
reduced. Project-initiated preventive and surveillance activities promoted&#13;
equity because thetr allocation was based on need. For children's other&#13;
services, differences in use were shifted in favor of low-caste children, low-&#13;
income families, landless families, and those with the fewest material&#13;
possessions. The coverage by women's other services was similar.&#13;
Decline in Fertility&#13;
The fertility data disaggregated by experimental groups do not permit firm&#13;
inferences about trends in annual fertility rates or about the effect of&#13;
services on these rates0 The period was too short to observe a secular trend&#13;
or to calculate moving averages to correct fluctuations0 In addition, the&#13;
births in a year, on which the fertility rates were based, were few in number,&#13;
and fluctuations were accentuated because the births were to different groups&#13;
of women0 There also was variation in the quality of birth data gathered in&#13;
the various groups: villages that had the most extensive services had the&#13;
least underreporting0&#13;
Effectiveness&#13;
The fluctuation in fertility rates from year to year was consider-&#13;
able, partly because of the small sizes of the experimental groups0 The&#13;
largest decline was in FPWS villages (21 percent), followed by FPWSCC villages&#13;
(15 percent)0 The decline in FPED villages was 7 percent, that in the control&#13;
villages 12 percent0   The FPCC villages registered a rise of 2 percent0   Thus,&#13;
two of the groups (FPWS and FPWSCC) had declines significantly greater than&#13;
the control group. The crude birth rates reflect the same patterns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
The use of family planning had the greatest effect in FPWS villages:&#13;
differences were highly significant in all three years (table 10). Reductions&#13;
in births were also significant in FPWSCC villages, but the effect was less&#13;
than in FPWS villages. These results establish the link between the use of&#13;
services and the reductions in fertlity through contraceptive use.&#13;
As noted earlier, the fertility decline was greatest in FPWS&#13;
villages, next greatest in FPWSCC villages. The results indicate that such&#13;
declines were achieved by contraceptive use from project sources. In FPCC and&#13;
FPED villages, the reductions in births were, not significant, partly because&#13;
of a smaller number of contraceptive users.&#13;
Because of the limitations of fertility data based on groups, an&#13;
attempt was made to assess the effect of services on fertility, primarily&#13;
through relating changes in the fertility of individual women to the use of&#13;
service inputs. The individual-level variable was constructed by measuring&#13;
the percentage change in the annual probability of birth for each woman&#13;
exposed to pregnancy during the project. 1/&#13;
1/  This was constructed as follows:    by using the information on duration of&#13;
marriage (D1) and the total number of live births (B1) up to the end of&#13;
1969, the average annual probability of birth (P1 = B1/D1) was computed&#13;
for each woman to indicate preproject fertility. Similarly, by using the&#13;
duration of the project (D ) and total live births (B2) during the project&#13;
up to the time the women withdrew from project exposure (outmigration,&#13;
dissolution of marriage, or end of project, whichever happened first),&#13;
another average annual probability of birth (P - R /D ) was computed.&#13;
The absolute decline (P1 - P2) in the probability of birth was then&#13;
expressed as a percentage of the initial level (P1). The percentage&#13;
decline in fertility was&#13;
l00(Pl - P2)/P1l&#13;

Of the 2,298 cases examined during the project, about 18 percent had&#13;
an increase in the probability of birth, and about 4 percent had no change.&#13;
But 78 percent of women in the sample had a decline, though low. More than&#13;
half had a decline in probability of less than 20 percent; about a fifth more&#13;
than 20 percent. As would be expected, age is significantly related to the&#13;
dependent variable.&#13;
The relationship between the use of services and the individual-level&#13;
fertility decline appears to be complex. Table 11 presents the mean number of&#13;
service contacts of various types by the groups with varying ratios of&#13;
fertility decline. The table shows that in all instances the least use of&#13;
services was related to a moderate decline in fertility. Those who had no&#13;
decline, or even a negative decline, were heavy users of services, as were&#13;
those who had high declines in fertility. These results suggest that some&#13;
heavy users were families to which services were rendered in response to&#13;
health needs generated by high fertility. The most relevant finding is that&#13;
the remaining group of heavy users of services had a substantial decline in&#13;
fertility (16 percent and more), and these couples may be those for whom the&#13;
fertility impact of services was beginning to be evident. The relation&#13;
between service inputs and the dependent variable (the percentage decline in&#13;
the average probability of birth per year of exposure to the project) is&#13;
therefore nonlinear.&#13;
Efficiency&#13;
The cost-effectiveness of the Narangwal services in causing a decline&#13;
in fertility cannot be ascertained because of the ambiguity observed in the&#13;
relationship between the use of services and a decline in fertility. The&#13;
indirect evidence is of course provided through the observed link between the&#13;
practice of family planning and fertility at the group level (see table 11)&#13;

and the cost-effectiveness of integrated services in increasing family&#13;
planning use. As noted before, the duration of the project was not long&#13;
enough to have the full effect on fertility. This makes the analysis of the&#13;
project's efficiency in causing a decline in fertility tenuous.&#13;
Equity&#13;
The evidence on equity is also ambiguous. The earlier discussion&#13;
indicated that equity was achieved in the practice of family planning from&#13;
project sources0 An analysis of the fertility decline by income groups&#13;
indicates, however9 that the proportion of women who experienced either an&#13;
increase or no change in the annual probability of birth decreased with&#13;
income9 but that a greater proportion of women in higher income groups had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
declines in fertility measured by the annual probability of birth. 1/ The&#13;
association is significant.&#13;
Caste is the most important indicator of social status in Punjab.&#13;
For Jat-Sikhs (high caste) the proportion of women who experienced an increase&#13;
in the annual probability of birth was lowest and the proportion who exper-&#13;
ienced reductions was highest. The findings were reversed for scheduled Sikhs&#13;
(low caste). The others were in between. The husband's education was&#13;
associated differently with declines in the individual level fertility of&#13;
women. The women with better educated husbands (sixth grade or higher) fell&#13;
predominantly into two extreme groups--one experiencing no fertility decline&#13;
and the other experiencing a decline of more than 20 percent during the&#13;
project. The less educated group had a higher proportion with a moderate (up&#13;
to 20 percent) decline in fertility. These findings indicate that the objec-&#13;
tive of equity was at least partially achieved because a moderate decline was&#13;
achieved among the less educated group and not all in the higher educated&#13;
group experienced a decline in fertility.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
The Narangwal data provides some of the most important evidence recorded any-&#13;
where on the benefits of integrating family planning with health services.&#13;
The results show that the benefits can be great--in effectiveness, in effic-&#13;
iency, and in equity, whether measured by health or by family planning. Even&#13;
for a decline in fertility, for which the project life was too short to be&#13;
evident, the results generally show that integration helps.&#13;

            Integrating family planning with health services
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Narangwal is more than the name of a
            village in Punjab, India. It has become associated with one
            of the best known and well documented field experiments in
            health care and family planning anywhere in the world. In
            that experiment, groups of villages were provided with
            combinations of services for health, family planning, and
            nutrition between 1968 and 1974. The households in each
            group were then followed through extensive data gathering.
            The World Bank has been collaborating with Johns Hopkins
            University in analyzing this rich set of data to study
            policy questions relating to systems for the delivery of
            services. Two monographs on the findings of this
            research--one dealing with population, one with
            nutrition--are forthcoming. One important question addressed
            in the population monograph is whether the integration of
            health and family planning services helps in attaining
            family planning and health objectives. This paper focuses on
            the findings on this question. The findings show that
            integration was more effective in recruiting family planning
            acceptors than was the provision of family planning alone.
            They also show that integration was more cost effective than
            separate services and more equitable in distributing family
            planning services to all socioeconomic groups.
