appropriately, one of the millennium&#13;
development goals. At the second World&#13;
Water Forum (The Hague, March 2000) it&#13;
was declared that by 201 5 the proportion of&#13;
people without access to hygienic&#13;
sanitation facilities should be halved, and&#13;
that by 2025 access to safe water and&#13;
hygienic sanitation facilities should be&#13;
available to everyone.                                                                                                  21&#13;
The challenge is to find approaches to&#13;
achieve these bold targets. At the heart of&#13;
this challenge are the questions of how to&#13;
trigger the change in traditional sanitation&#13;
practices, how to sustain the changes,&#13;
and how to scale-up successes. To achieve&#13;
such sustainable changes we need to&#13;
better understand the role of individuals,                                                            I&#13;

in this process.            ^. i _&#13;
Bangladesh, like many other similarly&#13;
placed developing countries, has been&#13;
trying to answer these questions with some          r&#13;
excellent results on the ground. The&#13;
objective of this workshop was to initiate an  1&#13;
exchange between Bangladesh and India&#13;
(with its bold Central Government-supported  1    s    -.-&#13;
Total Sanitation Campaign) to see if learning&#13;

VOICES...                          reult   i a&#13;
My visit to the villages in Bangladesh resulted in a &#13;
paradigm shift in my thinking on sanitation...No subsidies  'Y&#13;
were given and the villagers were convinced of the   -;&#13;
necessity of toilets by what could be termed as 'shock                                 '&#13;
treatment'...The villagers were very proud of their toilets,&#13;
and lost all embarrassment in showing them. They had  -&#13;
proudly put up a board stating that no person defecates in&#13;
public. Land was donated to build toilets.&#13;

Although the Government's Total Sanitation Campaign&#13;
(TSC) now includes a sizable software and IEC component&#13;
individual subsidies, albeit lower than before, continue to&#13;
form an integral part of the approach. It may well be the  ,1muj_&#13;
case that a more innovative subsidy design may be more&#13;
effective in achieving the goal of 100 percent sanitized      E&#13;
villages. International experience states that subsidies can  *                            I.&#13;
be targeted at technical assistance, awareness promotion&#13;
and local enterprise development in place of subsidized&#13;
construction. There is growing evidence from different&#13;
initiatives in the country to suggest that fiscal support&#13;
directed at local governments and communities, together                 =               ;&#13;
with motivation, might provide the answer to this complex&#13;
and vexed problem. Careful thinking on the design of such&#13;

            change : tackling the sanitation challenge
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Sanitation remains one of the biggest
            development challenges and is, appropriately, one of the
            millennium development goals. At the second World Water
            Forum (The Hague, March 2000) it was declared that by 2015
            the proportion of people without access to hygienic
            sanitation facilities should be halved, and that by 2025
            access to safe water and hygienic sanitation facilities
            should be available to everyone. The challenge is to find
            approaches to achieve these bold targets. At the heart of
            this challenge are the questions of how to trigger the
            change in traditional sanitation practices, how to sustain
            the changes, and how to scale-up successes. To achieve such
            sustainable changes we need to better understand the role of
            individuals, households, communities and governments in this
            process. Bangladesh, like many other similarly placed
            developing countries, has been trying to answer these
            questions with some excellent results on the ground.
