At IFC, our difference is our strength.&#13;
In a world full of potential entrepreneurs but risk-averse   commercial&#13;
lenders and investors, IFC fills a unique role. IFC is the only multilateral&#13;
institution that        provides both affordable capital and global experience&#13;
to private businesses in developing nations.&#13;
Our unique position generates a different way of fostering market-oriented&#13;
development. There is a difference in our       knowledge of markets and&#13;
experience in structuring transactions in developing countries. There is a difference&#13;
in the good corporate governance principles we promote. There is a difference&#13;
in the strength of our partnerships with project sponsors, local&#13;
communities, and others that benefit from the projects we finance. There is a&#13;
difference in the high environmental and social standards our projects meet.&#13;
The value we add to each transaction and advisory project  we under-&#13;
take sets us apart as a financier of business in the developing world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
RENCEI&#13;
IFC has been promoting good business practices for many years. For nearly a decade, we have&#13;
worked systematically to advance better environmental and social outcomes and stronger&#13;
corporate governance by increasing our due diligence and internal capacity in those areas.&#13;
Today, we strive to demonstrate best practices through the projects we finance and the&#13;
policies we follow.&#13;
We are focusing our efforts more strategically on projects where we can have the strongest&#13;
developmental impact. This is taking us to countries where the private sector is undeveloped&#13;
and into sectors that have not traditionally attracted private sector financing. We are&#13;
focusing especially on investments in the financial sector, which is essential to expanding access&#13;
to capital. In many cases this support results in increased financing for small and&#13;
medium enterprises. The other sectors we are targeting are infrastructure, information&#13;
and communication technologies, and social sectors such as health and education. This year&#13;
over 70 percent of our committed investments involved target sectors, and 14 percent related&#13;
to small and medium enterprises.&#13;
Building on our strengths, we are determined to become a more effective leader&#13;
of the private sector in promoting sustainable development. We are committed to showing&#13;
that a greater awareness of the risks and opportunities related to environmental, social,&#13;
and corporate governance factors can be part of a business strategy to produce better profits&#13;
through growth, improved efficiency, lower costs, increased revenues, better access to capital,&#13;
and a more positive brand image. That positive image, backed up by positive action,&#13;
can reduce the risks for companies that recognize a broader responsibility to society and&#13;
local communities.&#13;
The financial and economic viability of projects remains at the heart of our approach to&#13;
long-term sustainability. As we go forward, our staff and business partners must do more than&#13;
incorporate environmental, social, and minority investor safeguards into the private sector&#13;
projects that we finance. A sustainable approach to doing business means linking together the&#13;
strengths IFC already brings its clients, thus enabling us to deliver "the IFC difference" in a&#13;
more coherent, efficient, and innovative way.&#13;

Group, we can bring parties together to develop innovative approaches to issues&#13;
that benefit all concerned.&#13;

,- PRODUCTS AND SERVICES&#13;
INVESTMENT TOOLS&#13;
r        IFC risks its own capital by buying shares in project companies, other project entities, financial institutions, and&#13;
portfolio or private equity funds. We generally subscribe to between 5 and 20 percent of a project's equity. \XNe&#13;
will not normally hold more than a 35 percent stake and are never the single largest shareholder in a project.&#13;
EQUITY AND                   We are a long-term investor in our projects. When it comes time to sell, we prefer to exit by selling shares in&#13;
QUASI-EQUITY                 the capital markets following a public offering.&#13;
Through our quasi-equity instruments, we invest through products that have both debt and equit)y&#13;
characteristics. Some instruments, like subordinated loans and convertible debt, impose fixed-repayment&#13;
schedules. Others, such as preferred stock and income notes, do not require such rigid repayment arrangements.&#13;
We finance projects and companies through our A-loans, which are for IFC's own account. IFC does not accept&#13;
government guarantees. Maturities of A-loans generally range between 7 and 12 years at origination, but some&#13;
loans have been extended to as long as 20 years. Most IFC loans are provided in major currencies, and we are&#13;
expanding our capacity to offer local currency loans.&#13;
LOAN AND                        We carry out comprehensive due diligence before investing in anv project. Because of our extensive&#13;
INTERMEDIARY           t    lending experience in developing countries, we are uniquely qualified to evaluate the risks associated with&#13;
S    projects. We are willing to extend loans that are repaid only from the cash flow of the project, with only&#13;
limited recourse or without recourse to the sponsors.&#13;
We also make loans to intermediary banks, leasing companies, and other financial institutions through&#13;
credit lines that result in further on-lending. These credit lines are often targeted at small businesses.&#13;
X Mobilization of private sector financing in developing countries is fundamental to the fulfillment of IFCs role&#13;
as a development catalyst. We can broaden our impact by mobilizing loans from other financial institutions that&#13;
are willing to lend to projects only with our participation.&#13;
Syndicated loans, or B-loans, are the cornerstone of IFCs mobilization efforts. Through this mechanism,&#13;
MOBILIZATION                 financial institutions share fully in the commercial credit risk of projects while IFC remains the lender of record.&#13;
Participants in IFCs loans share in the advantages that IFC derives as a multilateral development institution,&#13;
including preferred access to foreign exchange. Where applicable, banks are also exempted from the&#13;
mandatory provisioning that regulatory requirements impose.&#13;
We also mobilize private capital for companies by engaging in underwriting, private placements, and&#13;
equity fund investments, which help clients gain access to international capital markets, often for the first time.&#13;
Loan and bond guarantees and standby financing allow our clients to use IFC's good credit to help them secure&#13;
financing from international capital markets.&#13;
IFC offers credit enhancement structures for debt instruments. These include partial credit guarantees, which&#13;
allow IFC to use its triple-A credit rating to help clients attract new sources of financing, reduce financing costs,&#13;
and extend maturities. Credit guarantees cover all credit risks during a specified portion of the financing term&#13;
or up to a specified capped amount and often serve to extend maturities beyond what private creditors would&#13;
otherwise provide.&#13;
GUARANTEES                  .We can extend a partial guarantee either in a local currency or in a foreign currency. The partial guarantee&#13;
AND  RISK                    in local currency benefits borrowers by providing access and sought-after maturities and in the process&#13;
MANAGEMENT                   helps develop local financial markets. In the international bond markets, a partial credit guarantee in foreign&#13;
currency helps an IFC client company establish its own name with international investors and thus assists the&#13;
client in diversifying its funding sources.&#13;
Our risk management services enable clients to access derivatives markets through IFC as an intermediary.&#13;
With IFC's currencv-hedging instruments, our clients can hedge exposure related to foreign currency borrow-&#13;
ings. With IFC's interest-rate hedges, clients can transform the nature of their borrowings (for example, fixed&#13;
rate to floating rate or vice versa). IFC's commodity price-hedging products allow clients to reduce risks&#13;
related to price volatility. We also provide risk management facilities so that clients can use hedging products&#13;
for a fixed period of time on a pre-approved basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
OTHER SERVICES&#13;
IFC advisory services are designed to improve the investment climate in member countries and the&#13;
business practices of companies in which we invest. They play an increasingly important role in the way&#13;
IFC approaches its investment activities.&#13;
We undertake a wide array of financial market advisory assignments, specializing in securities markets&#13;
and banking and credit institutions. Assignments address areas such as locnl debt market development and&#13;
ADVISORY                     capacity building at financial institutions.&#13;
SERVICES                !        The work of the Private Sector Advisory Services, jointly managed by IFC and the World Bank, covers&#13;
policy issues, sector advice, and specific transactions. Our activity in this area includes advice on competition&#13;
policy, structuring of privatization deals, and policy analysis of foreign investment issues.&#13;
Another newly created and jointly managed unit, the Small and Medium Enterprise Department, focuses&#13;
on business environment issues, capacity building, and the development of innovative financing techniques. The&#13;
IFC Corporate Governance program provides advice on practices and policies at IFC investee companies,&#13;
assistance in addressing country-specific risks, and information on promoting strong corporate governance.&#13;
Technical assistance further complements IFC's investment activities by providing advice and training to&#13;

THE IFC WAY&#13;
The demanding job IFC undertakes is making business opportunities profitable&#13;
in the world's riskiest and most uncertain markets. In many countries the&#13;
private sector is undeveloped, local or foreign partners are inexperienced, or&#13;
bus ness practices fall short of international standards. To address these needs,&#13;
we tailor our services as the situation demands. We also focus on seeing that&#13;
natural resources are used to increase national wealth on equitable social terms&#13;
while ma ntaining a healthier an nronment.&#13;
We have assembled a staff of 1,951 men    that help make their businesses operate and&#13;
and women from 130 countries with the specialist    perform in ways they could nor have achieved on&#13;
skills necessary to build relationships, appraise   their own. We can do this through the efforts of our&#13;
financial options, assess technical and environ-    various specialist departments.&#13;

AEVALUATING PERFORMANCE&#13;
Evaluation is an integral part of the IFC management process. Investment departments execute self-evaluation reports on a random sam-&#13;
ple of mature investment projects and all completed technical assistance projects. The independent Operations Evaluation Group ver-&#13;
ifies the findings. OEG contributes to corporate learning and accountability for results through annual reports and special studies,&#13;
including country evaluations, sector and thematic evaluations, and process evaluations. The cases below are derived from OEG's&#13;
latest Annual Review of IFC's Evaluation Findings, which synthesizes performance patterns, draws inferences relevant to strategy, alnd&#13;
makes recommendations to management and the Board for improving effectiveness (see p. 72 for a summary of the Annual Review).&#13;
IFC has learned to replicate lessons from successful mature projects. In one case, we financed part of trie&#13;
capital expenditure plan to rehabilitate a recently privatized water and sewerage system, Aguas Argentinas. The&#13;
project resulted in improved efficiency, lower water rates, and increased access to clean water and sewerage for&#13;
a large segment of the urban population. Capacity increased 26 percent, resulting in nearly I million new water&#13;
customers and about 400,000 additional sewerage customers in a city of 9.4 million people. Operations becamne&#13;
profitable after years of losses and subsidies.&#13;
REPLICATING                    The success of the project illustrated the importance of the commitment and flexibility of&#13;
SUCCESS                     government and project sponsors, who ensured in this case a fair and transparent regulatory structure.&#13;
We learned to look for partners with a long view who accept that the major benefits of a project accrue from&#13;
profitable operations over time.&#13;
We also found that worker cooperation and good labor relations are critical in postprivatization projects.&#13;
In this case, the company increased average salaries by 40 percent, undertook an intensive training program&#13;
for employees, designed a voluntary retirement program with worker participation, and developed an&#13;
employee ownership scheme. The result was a highly motivated, productive, and competitive work force.&#13;
(-Since not all projects are successful, we also draw lessons from those with unsatisfactory outcomes. In one such&#13;
case, we supported the upgrade of meat-processing plants intended to enhance export product quality, expand&#13;
the domestic product range, and improve hygiene standards. Operationally the project succeeded, but mar-&#13;
ket conditions and a change in management caused it to fail financially.&#13;
The company had expected small competitors to go out of business when the government&#13;
LEARNING FROM               enforced hygiene standards and tax rules. But that failed to happen, while beef consumption declined in&#13;
EXPERIENCE                  export markets.&#13;
From this experience, we learned not to underestimate competitors' strengths or the flexibility of small&#13;
operators in an environment where reforms are untested. We learned how disruptive ownership and&#13;
management changes can be during a depressed industry cycle. We also learned that we can avoid&#13;
misunderstandings by better clarifying environmental reporting expectations as part of the project appraisal&#13;
and investment negotiations.&#13;

ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY&#13;
COMPLIANCE ADVISOR/OMBUDSMAN&#13;
The Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman promotes better accountability of IFC and MIGA&#13;
management to people affected by their projects. It is an independent office, reporting&#13;
directy to the president of the World Bank Group rather than to IFC or MIGA management.&#13;
Its mandate is to assist people affected by projects by addressing complaints in a fair,&#13;
objective, and constructive manner and to enhance the social and environmental impact&#13;
of IFC and MIGA projects.&#13;
The CAO carries out its function in three ways: by    Board's decision. These recommendations were incor-&#13;

The environment for private sector investment remains difficult in&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa. Under such circumstances, IFC must find&#13;
innovative ways to support the private sector's contribution to&#13;
development. Despite economic challenges, we were able to support&#13;
private sector business opportunities in the region, especially&#13;
focusing on the financial sector, infrastructure projects, small and&#13;

The need for private enterprises to contribute to economic growth&#13;
in Asia and the Pacific is pressing. But the private sector faces a&#13;
slowing world economy, stalled economic reforms, fiscal deficits.&#13;
and restrictions on the borrowing capacity of private firms.&#13;
Although obstacles differ among countries, they all limit the&#13;
ability of the public and private sectors to bring about rapid anc&#13;

FINANCIAL REVIEW&#13;
Operating income in FY 2001 was $241 million, below the $380 million earned&#13;
in FYOO and $249 million in FY99 (operating income excludes the effects of&#13;
adopting new accounting standards for derivatives and hedging activities&#13;
for FY01; including these effects, IFC's net income totaled $345 million in&#13;
FY 2001). The Corporation's operating results in FY01 reflected some further&#13;
deterioration in portfolio performance and a higher level of loss provisioning than&#13;
in the previous year. Offsetting these negative factors on operating results&#13;
was a strong performance in liquid assets. These effects, combined with lower&#13;
realized equity portfolio income and lower loan interest collections, resulted in&#13;
a decline in the return on average net worth from 6.9 percent in FYOO to 4.1&#13;
percent in FY01.&#13;
The loan portfolio generated a net operating loss of   New investment commitments for IFC's account&#13;
$11 million in FY01 (after charges for borrowing    amounted to $2.7 billion (including $0.5 billion in&#13;
costs, nonaccruals, specific loss provisions, and admin-    signed guarantees), and an additional $1.3 billion&#13;
istrative expenses). This follows net operating income    in loan syndications were signed. The disbursed invest-&#13;

portfolios-that is, the portfolios funded from net    $10.9 billion from June 30, 2000. The Corporations&#13;
worth-recorded a net operating loss of $10 million    administrative expenses increased in FY01 in line&#13;
in FY01, compared to net operating income of$191    with approved budget funding to allow a better&#13;
million in FY00, mainly because of higher loss provi-   response to IFC's development mandate in global&#13;
sions. This included realized capital gains of $91    financial markets that continued to present signifi-&#13;
million from sales of equities as well as dividend    cant investment risks. As a share of average disbursed&#13;
receipts of $131 million (compared with $132 million    investment portfolio, total administrative expenses&#13;
and $130 million, respectively, in FY00). Net oper-    were 2.8 percent in FY01, higher than the 2.6&#13;

OPERATIONS EVALUATION REVIEW&#13;
The Operations Evaluation Group's Annual Review 2000 presents the cumulative&#13;
evaluation findings from four years of IFC investment operations. It describes&#13;
significant performance patterns among 176 randomly selected operations from&#13;
1991-94 approvals that were evaluated at early operating maturity between 1996&#13;
and 1999. The review draws implications from past performance for current strategy&#13;
and makes recommendations to management and the Board for improving IFC's&#13;
results in pursuit of its strategy.&#13;
