1.  BOGOTA AND THE URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Urban Development and Transport in Bogota&#13;
1.1   Population and Economic Context. Bogotas 6.5 million residents account for about&#13;
16% of Colombia's total population. The high growth rate of the 1960s dropped to about 3% in&#13;
the 1980s and is projected to average just over 2.5% annually during the 1990s, thus bringing the&#13;
population to about 8 million by the year 2000. Unlike many other urban areas in the region&#13;
where growth is from new births of residents, most of Bogota's population growth is fueled by&#13;
migrants responding to various "push" factors (regional guerrilla violence, climatic problems, land&#13;
availability, and, more recently violence from drug trafficking in rural areas). At about US$1,700&#13;
equivalent, GDP per capita is about 50% higher in Bogota than for Colombia as a whole. At the&#13;
macro-economic level, Bogota is a major contributor to Colombia's economy, accounting for&#13;
about 25% of the value added in manufacturing nationwide, 35% of the domestic production of&#13;
services and about 46% of the employed population among the large urban centers.&#13;
1.2   Spatial Development. The city has experienced a steady north-south expansion between the&#13;
floodplain of the Rio Bogota in the west and mountains in the east. The urbanized area grew from&#13;
about 25,000 hactares in 1982 to about 35,000 today, with a density of about 18,500 inhabitants per&#13;
kM2. Currently, the District comprises twenty local administrative entities of which nineteen are urban&#13;
and one rural. Additionally, there are twelve neighboring urban municipalities with close economic&#13;
links to the District (See map).&#13;
1.3   While local government policies of the 1980s have been somewhat successful in stemming&#13;
low-density sprawl within the administrative limits of Bogota, encroachment in neighboring&#13;
municipalities continued to occur. In both Bogota and these outlying areas, population growth&#13;
was not accompanied by sufficient expansion or strengthening of the infrastructure system so that&#13;
over the past decade it has been difficult for most municipalities to effectively enforce their land&#13;
use regulations. One feature which has helped to some extent in Bogota is the practice of&#13;
identifying and acquiring urban areas ahead of time for future street expansion. In most cases, in&#13;
spite of widespread squatting, the city has been.generally successful in gaining access to these&#13;
areas for system expansion.&#13;
1.4   To some degree, as is apparent from the shift out of the old downtown area, congestion&#13;
and a scarcity of parking space have been important factors in influencing location of settlement&#13;
and commercial activities. Most of the wealthier residents live in neighborhoods north of the&#13;
downtown area while the poorer ones live in low-income settlements in the south and northwest.&#13;
At the same time, manufacturing and commercial activities are located along the main corridors&#13;
and service jobs have moved or are being created mostly in the north and center uptown area.&#13;
This spatial incongruency between activity centers and settlements is one of the main causes of&#13;
the current transport problem which Bogota presently faces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.5   Poverty. Based on the UN definition of unsatisfied essential needs, an estimated 1.3&#13;
million residents of Bogota are poor with about 500,000 living in absolute poverty. The largest&#13;
low-income settlements are located in the hilly southern outskirts where many basic services&#13;
(water, sewerage, electricity, etc.) are lacking and many residents spend more than four hours a&#13;
day commuting to jobs, businesses and other such destinations. Residents rank inadequate&#13;
transport second only to crime in terms of their concems and priority needs.&#13;
1.6   Road Infrastructure Network and Traffic Conditions. Although there are data in&#13;
various agencies, Bogota does not have a full and complete centralized inventory of the existing&#13;
infrastructure network in terms of such factors as type, age, physical characteristics, usage, and&#13;
current condition. It is estimated that it has about 10,190 lane/km of roads. Of this, about 2,250&#13;
make up the primary network and 1,320 the secondary network, with the remaining 6,620 being&#13;
local roads. About 60% of the network system is in good condition and requires routine&#13;
maintenance, while about 40% requires extensive restoration work.&#13;
1.7   About 530,000 vehicles or about 25% of the national fleet, are registered in Bogota with&#13;
an additional 300,000 being registered in neighboring municipalities. It is estimated that about&#13;
90% of the present stock are light vehicles (cars, jeeps, pick-ups), with about 4% buses and&#13;
microbuses and about 4% trucks. Between 1991 and 1992 the number of newly-registered&#13;
vehicles grew from just under 14,900 to 20,400; in 1993 and 1994 these figures were 50,600 and&#13;
46,400 respectively, mainly because of Government relaxation of import restrictions. While&#13;
detailed statistics for the entire fleet are not available, it is estimated that the average age of the&#13;
public transport fleet in Bogota is about twenty years. Even with gasoline price at Col$ 787 (US$&#13;
0.90) per gallon, annual local gasoline sales reached 540 million gallons which was about 30% of&#13;
the national consumption. Overall, it is estimated that vehicle operating costs amount to about&#13;
2% of the GNP. Mobility is estimated at 1.4 daily motorized single trips per capita, 77% of which&#13;
are made by public transport, mostly buses. Increasing per capita income would most likely&#13;
continue to result in growth of auto ownership and use. This, combined with rising population&#13;
and commercial activity, will further strain the capacity of the existing system.&#13;
1.8   Even with existing infrastructure and a large number of vehicles, traffic flows are much&#13;
worse than these figures should indicate. Congestion is acute with peak hours extending to about&#13;
six hours per day and peak and mid-day flows being indistinguishable in some streets. The record&#13;
number of buses in Bogota (22,000) is hindered by congestion and contributes to it, partly due to&#13;
the continuous flow and partly through their "stop-on-demand" style of operations. Traffic&#13;
management has generally been inadequate. Signals are of an advanced technology but their&#13;
timing is not optimal, and the layout of many junctions could be improved. Converting some&#13;
streets to one-way during peak hours improved flows for a while but conditions are once again&#13;
becoming severely congested. Curb parking interferes with traffic capacity in many busy streets.&#13;
In 1994, the District signed a parking concession agreement for selected areas of the city. Off-&#13;
street parking space is scarce and this is not helped by price control (which was only recently&#13;
abolished) on the limited spaces available. Traffic law enforcement is inconsistent. Accident rates&#13;
are high and increasing, with an estimated 33,300 occurrences in Bogota between January and&#13;
November, 1994, a rate of about 45 per 1,000 vehicles. Pedestrians are presented with minimal&#13;
facilities and accounted for about 9% of the traffic casualties in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.9   Road Maintenance. Even with an increasingly aging system, maintenance spending has&#13;
lagged, hovering at around US$6 million per year (in 1992, maintenance spending reached a peak&#13;
of US$17 million, but subsequently fell), an amount dwarfed by the estimated US$750 million&#13;
annually spent by users on vehicle operating costs in the city and less than half the recurrent needs&#13;
for a paved network of about 5,700 lane-km. Street drainage works are poorly maintained, and&#13;
flooding on rainy days causes traffic gridlocks and damages road structures. In 1990 the local&#13;
government started a program of pothole patching (by force account and local contractors) on&#13;
arterials to arrest road decay and postpone extensive repair works. This program has had limited&#13;
success because of uneven supervision and poor execution standards and the exclusion of many&#13;
major rehabilitation works for several structurally-damaged road sections.&#13;
1.10  Public Transport. About 77% of the trips are taken in public transport facilities. A fleet&#13;
of about 11,600 buses and 10,300 minibuses (busetas, microbuses, colectivos, camionetas and&#13;
camperos) operates on 671 routes with about 90% of these trips concentrated in 14 main&#13;
corridors. All services are privately operated by about 63 companies and while they receive no&#13;
subsidies, neither do they pay for the right to the routes they service. Comfort and safety are poor&#13;
with about 50% of the fleet of public buses more than 20 years old. Although the bus system&#13;
provides extensive coverage of accessible areas at generally affordable fares it is estimated that&#13;
about 500,000 low-income residents in peripheral areas lack regular and reliable services. Some&#13;
neighborhoods cannot be reached at all by buses given the hilly characteristics and existing&#13;
equipment. In many low-income areas, transport services are intermittent and disrupted by rains.&#13;
Unlicensed pickup trucks or jeeps generally provide some substitution services at high fares&#13;
reflecting the rough operating conditions. In the central city, congestion results in low service&#13;
levels, with operating speeds below 10 kph in several corridors. It also affects the profitability of&#13;
bus operations by raising operating costs and reducing the number of daily round trips a bus can&#13;
make. Although load factors on individual trips have increased, total daily ridership per bus has&#13;
dropped 20% in the past decade to about 500 passengers.&#13;
1.11   The local government awards route rights to companies which in turn issue these to about&#13;
63 companies which are basically groupings of several thousands affiliates who are owners or&#13;
owner-drivers. In return for a monthly fee, the companies organize route assignments and&#13;
coverage with the goal of equalizing profitability of their members. In theory, the licensing&#13;
system controls entry, routes, frequencies and fares. In practice, little enforcement of license&#13;
terms is performed and companies have no difficulty in creating a new route or withdrawing from&#13;
existing service. While the system has the appearances of a deregulated one, there is really little&#13;
competition among companies since each has monopoly rights to its awarded route. The area of&#13;
competition lies among the drivers and operators who have no job security or social benefits and&#13;
whose salary depend upon the number of passengers transported, a situation which pushes them&#13;
to commit many infractions and become involved in many accidents.&#13;
1.12  In 1990, bus fares were restructured and raised in real terms to encourage fleet renewal&#13;
and improve service coverage. There is a flat fare (not related to distance) which is now 120 -&#13;
350 pesos (US$0.14-US$0.40). While the fare system has recently been simplified somewhat, it&#13;
is still very complicated to determine and enforce since there are theoretically over twenty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
different levels incorporating several factors such as age of vehicle, time, and services offered. In&#13;
general, higher fares apply for services using newer buses, night operations, and for peripheral&#13;
routes.&#13;
1.13  While the fares of the upmarket "executive" and "super-executive" buses can be changed&#13;
with relatively little objection from the District (libertad vigilada), the fares for low-income&#13;
groups are negotiated each year between the operators and the District. The local government&#13;
tries to reconcile the profit goal of the operators with affordability criteria and the need to (a)&#13;
maintain flexibility in allowing bus operators to create or adjust services; (b) keep fares at levels&#13;
encouraging fleet renewal; and (c) enforce more stringent standards for vehicles to phase out&#13;
aging stock and promote safety with less environmental hazards.&#13;
1.14  Past national economic policies have contributed to the aging of the bus fleet. Until&#13;
recently, trade restrictions resulted in a limited range of obsolete bus models being sold at high&#13;
prices. Rigidities in the financial system also made long-term credit unavailable to small&#13;
enterprises, limiting the ability of bus operators to purchase new vehicles. In 1990, the&#13;
Government dismantled non-tariff barriers on most imports, including vehicles and parts, and took&#13;
steps to allow the development of a more competitive financial sector. The Transportation Law&#13;
105 of 1993 stipulates that, among other things, cars and buses used for hire cannot be more than&#13;
twenty years old. This would result in a significant number of vehicles being withdrawn between&#13;
1995 and 2000. These reforms are expected to improve the underlying conditions and promote&#13;
long-term development of public transport services, though their full effect may take a few years&#13;
to materialize. While they have had a positive impact by providing incentives for fleet renewal, the&#13;
number of vehicles has also increased and added to current traffic and pollution problems.&#13;
1.15  The Avenida Caracas Busway. Despite the fact that a majority of residents ride buses,&#13;
most investments in the past have been dedicated to improving the flow of private automobiles.&#13;
The first major effort targeted at improving the public transport system was a busway built in&#13;
1989-90 in the southern half of the busiest bus corridor in the city, the Avenida Caracas (see&#13;
Annex 1 and map). Busways improve bus and car flows by providing exclusive tracks for each&#13;
mode. In the Avenida Caracas, this required only limited changes to the existing street&#13;
configuration. At a cost of US$ 4 million, it began operation in June 1990 and had such a&#13;
significant beneficial impact that in 1991, with the initial appraisal of the Bogota Transport&#13;
project, an 8-km Northern extension of the busway was proposed. Delays in project processing&#13;
resulted in the District constructing the extension on its own at a cost of US$ 10 million. The&#13;
busway includes four bus-only lanes and four lateral lanes for cars with left turns prohibited to&#13;
them. It carries hourly peak flows of over 22,000 passengers per direction and ranks among the&#13;
highest (for both busway and light rail system) in the world. Rush-hour bus operating speeds&#13;
have improved by 40%, to around 18 kph.&#13;
1.16  The District has been monitoring the impact of the busway. A recent evaluation identifies&#13;
operational problems stemming from operation and maintenance underfunding and staff allocation&#13;
to the unit responsible for enforcing vehicle and pedestrian traffic on the busway, and, in the&#13;
Northern section, from the absence of complementary area-wide traffic management measures.&#13;
Overall, these deficiencies have prevented the full attainment of the expected performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
objectives (in terms of vehicle speeds and passenger-carrying capacity) and produced an increase&#13;
in local accident rates by 20%. The proposed project would support selective key measures to&#13;
improve the performance of the busway and the operational unit.&#13;
1.17  Bicycle Transport. Recreational cycling is popular in Bogota and enjoys active support&#13;
from the local government. On Sundays and holidays, about 100 lane-km of major arterials are&#13;
closed to motorized traffic and used by several hundred thousand cyclists. The scheme, which has&#13;
virtually no fixed costs and requires little enforcement, has been operating successfully for over&#13;
five years. On weekdays, however, bicycle use is marginal. In the absence of segregated&#13;
bikeways or protected crossings, cycling in the chaotic Bogota traffic is dangerous. The current&#13;
mayor, who came into office in January 1995, is an avid supporter of non-motorized transport&#13;
alternatives and the proposed project will help finance studies which will examine the feasibility of&#13;
undertaking investments which would encourage increased use of such transport alternatives.&#13;
B. Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
1.18  The transport system in Colombia has gone through various institutional and policy&#13;
changes at all levels over the past decades. The current framework is the result of reforms of&#13;
1993 aimed at decentralization of the system. Until 1987, urban transport, at the national level,&#13;
was a responsibility of Colombia's Ministry of Public Works and Transport acting through its&#13;
National Transport Institute (1NTRA) which licensed and supervised urban bus and taxi services&#13;
and established their fares. Decrees 80 of 1987 and 1066 of 1988 transferred these responsibilities&#13;
to local governments and redefined INTRA's role in urban transport as that of a normative entity.&#13;
During 1993, as part of the reorganization of the transport agencies (Decree 2171), INTRA was&#13;
disbanded and its responsibilities transferred to the Ministry of Transport which today has the&#13;
role of a regulatory and normative national entity.&#13;
1.19  The Santafe de Bogota District Government (Distrito Capital or the District) now has the&#13;
primary responsibility for transport in the city (except for inter-municipal routes which is the&#13;
responsibility of the Transport Ministry). The District of Santafe de Bogota is composed of an&#13;
agglomeration of twenty entities (localidades) whose residents simultaneously elect their local&#13;
administrative boards (juntas administradoras), along with 35 representatives for the District&#13;
(Concejo) and its Mayor (Alcalde Mayor). The Mayor, for his part, appoints the local mayors,&#13;
who, with their local boards, have responsibility for ensuring compliance with the norms,&#13;
development plans, etc. for their jurisdictions. Overall responsibilities for the District lie with the&#13;
legislative branch (Concejo), the executive branch (Alcaldia) and several decentralized agencies.&#13;
The Concejo legislates by Acuerdos (agreements), which are enacted through mayoral decrees.&#13;
1.20  The 1991 Constitution established administrative autonomy for the Capital District of&#13;
Santafe de BogotA and in line with this, the Government issued a decree in July 1993, which&#13;
provisions of the Constitution made equivalent to a law - Decree 1421, Statute of BogotA -&#13;
through which the District enjoys a special status in administrative, organizational, and fiscal&#13;
terms. This provision enhances the autonomy of the District to manage, finance and implement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
programs and projects within its jurisdiction. Currently, it receives revenues which in the rest of&#13;
Colombia only accrue to the departmental governments (i.e. states) and its central administration&#13;
is subdivided in secretariats and departments which operate with funds handled by the District&#13;
Treasury (Secretaria de Hacienda). Decentralized agencies include Enterprises (Empresas),&#13;
Institutes (Instiluto*) and Funds (Fondos), all with legal character and separate budgets.&#13;
1.21   The District has comprehensive responsibilities for transport, from road construction to&#13;
traffic police and bus routes. This concentration of authority under one local body is matched in&#13;
few cities and creates a rare opportunity for an integrated management of the transport system.&#13;
Unfortunately, the District has made little use in the past of this opportunity and has exercised its&#13;
sectoral responsibilities through a number of agencies with little communication or coordination&#13;
among them and no clear overall policy-making entity in place.&#13;
1.22   There are three separate District agencies with responsibility for transport. The Urban&#13;
Development Institute (IDU) builds new roads while The Public Works Secretariat (SOP)&#13;
maintains public facilities including roads and parks and the Secretariat of Transit and Transport&#13;
(STT) has responsibility from its predecessor, DATT (the Administrative, Transport and Transit&#13;
Department) for traffic law enforcement, traffic safety and signs, driver and vehicle licensing, and&#13;
supervision of public transport. STT's investments are executed through a decentralized fund&#13;
called FONDATT (Fund for Traffic Safety and Education). Among some other entities having&#13;
sector responsibilities are the local telephone company which operates the traffic signal system&#13;
and the DAPD (District Planning Department) which defines the medium and long-term road&#13;
investment plans.&#13;
1 .23 Apart from the office of the Alcalde Mayor to which these agencies report, there has not&#13;
been any overall sector coordinating or policy entity. During the initial preparation of this project&#13;
in 1989-90, the Bank mission worked with counterpart District staff to address this problem. As&#13;
a consequence of this, an administrative reorganization plan was authorized by Acuerdo II of&#13;
1990, and was implemented through Decrees 265-267 of May 1991 with the aim of (a)&#13;
streamlining responsibilities for transport in the District; (b) establishing mechanisms and&#13;
institutional systems to better plan and integrate sector programs; and (c) strengthening the&#13;
capacity of the District for traffic management. Among other things, this plan resulted in the&#13;
elimination of DATT and the creation of STT along with a special planning subsecretariat and a&#13;
Transport Authority headed by the Mayor. This effort to achieve greater efficiency and&#13;
coordination has had limited success and a more comprehensive institutional reorganization is&#13;
currently under consideration.&#13;
1.24   Proposed reform of transport sector in the District. Since coming into office in&#13;
January 1995, the present city administration has been giving consideration to an institutional&#13;
reform the purpose of which would be to address the aforementioned coordination problems, and&#13;
to lay the foundation for a new long-term institutional framework for the transport sector in the&#13;
Capital District, so that the sector's long-term challenges can be tackled more efficiently. The&#13;
proposed reorganization would likely entail the following: (i) the creation of a single transit&#13;
authority institution for the Capital District; (ii) the liquidation, or amalgamation into this new&#13;
institution, of the current sector entities, IDU, FOSOP and STT; and (iii) the review of all current&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
functions and processes within the current sector entities, in order to formulate the functions of&#13;
the new institution with a strong propensity to contract-out specific functions to the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
1.25 While the concept is still at an early stage, initial steps have been taken by the District,&#13;
including the appointment of a transport committee, composed of prominent transport specialists,&#13;
to (a) advise the administration on sector strategy; (b) propose solutions to the transport and&#13;
transit problems; and (c) assess the appropriateness of the proposed Transit Authority. This&#13;
committee has concluded that sector planning and coordination needs improvement and it&#13;
endorses the integration of all sector functions. The District Administration has also included the&#13;
proposed restructuring of sector entities as part of its Development Plan. The detailed design of&#13;
the new institution and the overall transformation plan will now be studied in more detail by&#13;
consultants. The District is in the process of hiring a high-level consultant manager, independent&#13;
of existing and affected institutions, to coordinate and carry out the reform, including the needed&#13;
studies and subsequent activities.&#13;
1.26   This reform has still to secure the City Council's approval, a step with an uncertain&#13;
outcome, as it will likely face political resistance because of its implications in sensitive areas,&#13;
such as the severance of personnel. A fall-back position might limit the reform to strengthening&#13;
thc coordination and planning capabilities - but within the existing entities. Along with District-&#13;
Bank dialogue during supervision, the District, in its semi-annual reports, will keep the Bank fully&#13;
informed about the proposed institutional reform and its implementation, and will allow the Bank&#13;
to comment on these changes. The Bank has agreed to assist with the institutional reform&#13;
initiatives within the proposed operation, including relevant studies and future strengthening of&#13;
the new transport entity, if, and when, it is approved. In the meantime, the existing institutions&#13;
are capable of implementing the urgent bus corridors, access roads, and street maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation investments which need to move ahead. Moreover, the institutional strengthening&#13;
activities and studies proposed under the project for IDU, SOP and STT would still make a&#13;
beneficial contribution to the urban transport sector regardless of the outcome of the above&#13;
mentioned reforms (see Annex 3).&#13;
C. Performance of Sector Agencies&#13;
1.27   The Traffic and Transport Secretariat (STT). As DATT and later, STT, this entity has&#13;
placed more emphasis on routine enforcement work, licenses and other cash-generating activities&#13;
than on such areas as sector policies and planning, supervision and control of traffic and transport&#13;
in the city (see Annex 2). It is split between bloated administrative offices (current staff numbers&#13;
are 700) and an understaffed traffic police force (currently numbering about 1500) both of which&#13;
are frequently accused of corruption and related abuses. Labor rigidities exist in the lower&#13;
echelons, while politically-induced turnover is high at managerial levels and there is virtually no&#13;
professional career development system in place. The new administration is currently making&#13;
efforts aimed at raising the level and morale of the traffic police force, as well as its credibility&#13;
with the public.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
1.28  The intended effects of the 1991 reorganization were to: (a) establish STT as the lead&#13;
agency of the District for transport; (b) transfer to STT functions and organizational units&#13;
previously scattered among other agencies, such as the operation of traffic signals and the&#13;
supervision of parking lots; (c) assign to STT broad responsibilities for planning and policy&#13;
formulation, and create within STT a planning department, which will handle FONDATT; (d)&#13;
create a permanent inter-agency Transport Sector Committee, led by STT, to adopt sector&#13;
policies, steer the District's programs for transport, and approve annual budgets for traffic&#13;
management, road development and maintenance; and (e) strengthen FONDATT and expand its&#13;
scope of activities, enabling it to finance all traffic management investments of the District and to&#13;
handle technical assistance programs and policy studies for the sector. Though STT has taken&#13;
some initial steps in sector planning and the inter-agency committee has held regular coordinating&#13;
meetings, STT has not been able to assume the role envisaged in the 1991 reorganization&#13;
primarily because of strong resistance from the other sector entities to relinquish any power,&#13;
inadequate staffing in STT and the location of the Planning Secretariat low within the&#13;
organizational structure of the system so that it had little power to take actions independently.&#13;
1.29  Being an entity within the District's central administration, STT has low pay scales which&#13;
hinder its ability to recruit and retain competent professionals. Its budgeting and contracting&#13;
procedures are cumbersome and they are an obstacle to development projects.&#13;
1.30 The Traffic Safety Fund (FONDATT). Still named after STT's predecessor agency,&#13;
DATT, FONDATT was created in 1989 to address some of the above-mentioned deficiencies&#13;
(see Annex 2). Through it, STT can hire professionals either as long-term consultants or as&#13;
FONDATT staff under a better pay scale, and use more efficient procedures for project&#13;
implementation. A task-force of District professionals and consultants was assembled in 1989 to&#13;
design the Avenida Caracas busway after which it was then kept together to prepare the proposed&#13;
project. While STT has had some success as a result of the 1991 reorganization, its limited&#13;
impact on sector activities has been a factor for the current Mayor to seek more basic institutional&#13;
reforms (paras. 1.24-1.26).&#13;
1.31   The Public Works Secretariat (SOP). SOP shares many of the same administrative&#13;
weaknesses of STT. Its record for road maintenance has been poor. In the past, it has generally&#13;
executed road repairs through its own mostly unskilled workforce (currently numbering about&#13;
2,080). SOP's management and accounting systems lack the capacity to calculate full unit costs&#13;
which are excessive if overheads are factored in. Little preventive maintenance is performed and&#13;
its repair programs lack clear priorities with uneven quality of execution. Since 1989, SOP has&#13;
contracted out major rehabilitation works, and is now using force account only for patching or&#13;
resurfacing secondary roads. This policy should be continued and supported by a gradual&#13;
reduction of the workforce. An information system of road sections has been developed by&#13;
consultants but skilled staff and other resource needs have delayed its adoption and use as a&#13;
permanent tool for programming, budgeting and monitoring road maintenance. To facilitate the&#13;
budgeting and contracting of its investments, SOP established in 1990 a decentralized fund called&#13;
FOSOP, which is a legally independent entity although staffed with SOP personnel. As with the&#13;
STT fund, this is basically an attempt to use short-term devices to bypass rather than trying to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
address serious institutional problems. As part of the efforts of the current Mayor to streamline&#13;
sector institutions, FOSOP was liquidated in December 1995.&#13;
1.32  The Urban Development Institute (IDU). IDU was created in 1972 as a revolving fund&#13;
to execute infrastructure investments, including roads and bridges, and recover their costs through&#13;
betterment levies. The levies were successfully used in Bogota in the 1970s. Since then, they&#13;
have declined due to administrative logjams and a reluctance of the City Council to allow IDU to&#13;
enforce charges. During 1986-89 the city council withheld its approval of the investment plans&#13;
presented by IDU, disallowing all betterment charges except for an on-going program to pave&#13;
local streets.&#13;
1.33  In November 1990, the Bogota City Council approved a two-year plan of investments and&#13;
charges, including retroactive charges for roads executed since 1987. The Council also approved&#13;
a streamlined procedure, called "general benefit", to assess charges for road programs benefiting&#13;
large areas of the city. However, the new procedure was successfully challenged in a lower&#13;
administrative court, and was made effective only in September 1991 after its legality was upheld&#13;
by a decision of the State Council (highest administrative court). The measure was contested by&#13;
the general public and was subsequently canceled. (The ensuing deterioration of the District's&#13;
finances was a factor in the Bank's decision to cancel further processing of the project at that&#13;
time). In November 1992, under a new administration, a revised plan of betterment levies which&#13;
attempted to reduce disparities with the existing structure of property taxes was approved by the&#13;
District Council and billing was initiated in August 1993 after the approval of the new Statute for&#13;
the District. This should allow IDU to resume a more sustainable road development activity.&#13;
Early signs of the positive results of this trend are seen in the collection of about US$53 million&#13;
from betterment levies in the 1993-1994 period.&#13;
1.34 As a decentralized agency, IDU has more autonomy than STT or SOP (which are&#13;
municipal ones) in its day-to-day management. It also offers better salaries, and has been able to&#13;
retain competent professionals (total staff currently numbers about 530). However, IDU's&#13;
functions have not been critically analyzed for several years; its comparative advantage may not&#13;
reside in doing such tasks as design or census work in-house, and the number, skills mix and other&#13;
such aspects of its staff are currently under review within the present municipal administration.&#13;
1.35  The District Public Transport Enterprise (EDTU). EDTU was a transport enterprise&#13;
owned by the District with a fleet of 249 trolleybuses and 103 diesel buses. Most of the&#13;
trolleybuses were recent (1986-87), but the electricity network was in serious disrepair. Because&#13;
of poor management, undue political interference, overemployment, uneconomical routes (refused&#13;
by the private sector), frequent breakdowns and other related problems, fleet utilization dropped&#13;
to less than 25% by 1989 and EDTU's share of the city's total transit ridership was reduced to&#13;
only 0.2%. EDTU was placed in receivership by Decree 75 of 1991 and is close to being fully&#13;
liquidated. Sales of the liquidated assets are still to be finalized as is also payment of a debt which&#13;
the District owes to the national government for purchase of its buses in the 1970s. This has been&#13;
a key obstacle to further Bank processing of the loan since 1991 because the national government&#13;
(at the time) refused to guarantee this loan unless the outstanding debt issue was resolved. This&#13;
problem is now in its final stages of resolution after both parties agreed to binding arbitration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
D. Sector Investment Plans&#13;
1.36 Planning Framework. The Development Plan of the current administration identifies the&#13;
stultifying effects which an inadequate transport system has had upon the economy and&#13;
productivity of the city. Time lost in commuting and in shipping products and raw material, down&#13;
time and repair costs associated with poorly-maintained streets, pollution, losses from accidents&#13;
and fuel waste due to congested traffic are some of the results of the present situation. As part of&#13;
the strategy of the new administration to address these problems, it has proposed an approach&#13;
which emphasizes improved utilization of the existing infrastructure and greater emphasis upon&#13;
public transport systems. To this end, it is giving priority to mass transit needs in such areas as&#13;
specialized bus lanes, trunk lines, and expressways. Besides such investments, the administration&#13;
is also planning to rationalize existing bus routes, manage the assignment of new routes, withdraw&#13;
old polluting vehicles from circulation and enforce greater discipline in getting public transport&#13;
vehicles and all users to obey the rules and regulations. Other complementary areas of focus&#13;
include conservation of the existing transport infrastructure, actions aimed at achieving greater&#13;
efficiency and responsiveness through such measures as institutional reform, use of the private&#13;
sector for functions which it can perform more efficiently without impinging upon the District's&#13;
sovereignty and strengthening of the monitoring, supervision and control functions of public&#13;
sector entities.&#13;
1.37  For various reasons (for example, staff and budgetary constraints, politics, strong unions)&#13;
IDU, STT and SOP have not had a tradition of systematic short, medium and long term planning;&#13;
they tend to develop various proposals but their activities reflect a more reactive mode where&#13;
attention is given to crisis areas in an ad-hoc way. Their existing road development program for&#13;
street paving, traffic engineering and repair of arterials together amount to about US$250 million.&#13;
These proposals have yet to be ranked by order of priority or integrated into a coherent medium-&#13;
termn program. IDU's short-term investments for road development and bridges, worth about&#13;
US$90 million, are included in a three-year Plan de Obras Viales. 1993-95 approved in 1992 by&#13;
the city council. Although this plan can be sustained financially, the District's capacity to&#13;
implement it and the disruptive impact which its construction would have on the city's traffic&#13;
pattern may force an implementation schedule longer than anticipated. All District investments&#13;
are cleared with the Planning Department (DAPD) before being entered in the annual budgets. In&#13;
the past, proposals came to DAPD separately from each agency, without any prior consolidation&#13;
exercise for the sector and these took the form of wish-lists with the expectation of being reduced&#13;
significantly during the budgetary approval process. Since the overall sector framework is&#13;
generally absent and DAPD does not have the resources needed to evaluate these proposals in an&#13;
integrated way, transport planning has suffered. Some of the studies proposed under the project&#13;
would complement the proposed institutional reform measures (paras. 1.24-1.26) to address many&#13;
of these deficiencies.&#13;
1.38 Environmental Planning and Impact Assessments. The use of formal environmental&#13;
impact assessments (EIA) has been introduced only recently for District investments. In 1990 the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
District created a Department of the Environment, DAMA, to: (a) provide guidance to line&#13;
agencies to carry out EIAs for all major investments proposals in the District; and (b) prepare an&#13;
environmental management plan for Bogota and provide environmental inputs to DAPD for city&#13;
planning. At the national level, the recently-created Ministry of Environment (MinAmbiente) has&#13;
responsibility for environmental planning and it also shares responsibility for some environmental&#13;
issues in Bogota with DAMA and the Corporaci6n Autdnoma Regional de Cundinamarca&#13;
(CAR). Because EIAs for the road system are still relatively new, there is no well-developed&#13;
methodology which the District transport entities could follow. Consequently, there has been&#13;
little clarity as to what should be done, by whom, and in what manner. This issue is being&#13;
resolved through discussions among the affected agencies and a system is expected to be in place&#13;
shortly to assure that appropriate EIAs are carried out and that they would not be an obstacle to&#13;
project implementation. Assistance is being provided to DAMA by the District to facilitate&#13;
preparation of EIAs and address transport-related environmental issues.&#13;
1.39  The Metro Option. Consideration of a metro system for a city with a current population&#13;
in excess of 6 million, growing at about 3% annually, and with acute traffic congestion, has been&#13;
under discussion for more than a decade. In 1987, the national government called for turnkey&#13;
proposals to design, build and finance a metro system. Discussions were held with one&#13;
consortium for a route to the southwest but without reliable figures on ridership and demand, no&#13;
comparison of modal alternatives, and no detailed studies of the operation, fares, or integration&#13;
with bus services, the response was not positive. Under current conditions, the District as client,&#13;
and the national government as guarantor, would have to approve any metro contract. Both are&#13;
aware of the experience of Medellin, where a financing gap due to cost overruns of almost&#13;
US$1 .8 billion brought construction of the local metro to a halt in 1989 and this project is only&#13;
now limping to a close after a host of technical, financial and other problems.&#13;
1.40 In 1991, the National Planning Department (DNP) carried out a review which found a&#13;
metro project for Bogota not to be viable at that time. However, with increasing congestion and&#13;
clamour for a solution to the city's traffic problem, the District, with assistance from the national&#13;
government, again invited private sector firms to present proposals for a mass transit system to be&#13;
built and operated through concessions. The invitation was designed to elicit the widest range of&#13;
response (in terms of systems, routes, equipment, etc.) and the national government contracted&#13;
Halcrow-Fox to review, together with consultants contracted by the District, the proposals and&#13;
make its recommendations. This exercise resulted in the development of a strategy of an&#13;
integrated transport system within which there would be a North-South metro corridor in the&#13;
future with various feeder systems such as the Avenida Caracas, Calle 80, and Calle 13. As part&#13;
of the process of initiating the integrated transport system proposed in this plan, in December&#13;
1994, the District awarded a contract to Metrobus S.A., a private consortium, to design, build,&#13;
operate, administer and maintain, a four-line corridor network of about 92 km. with its own bus&#13;
fleet and support facilities. This bus system could also act as a feeder to the proposed metro.&#13;
Works are expected to get underway shortly and the service is scheduled to commence in 1998.&#13;
The International Finance Corporation is monitoring progress in this venture and has maintained&#13;
contact with Metrobus S.A.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
1.41  As indicated in the CONPES plan for 1995, the national government has agreed to help&#13;
the District to develop its integrated transport plan and is offering to finance the study of the&#13;
North-South metro corridor, along with a commitment to finance a share of the metro cost, after&#13;
the study is completed. In addition, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, JICA, under&#13;
a technical assistance program, began a study in August 1995 entitled the "Master Plan for Urban&#13;
Transport of Santafe de Bogota." This study would help to formulate a long-term master plan&#13;
and to establish an integrated sector information system. Meanwhile the new District&#13;
administration has adopted a cautious posture in committing to any investment in a new metro&#13;
system without a comprehensive evaluation of the costs involved for the population of Bogota&#13;
and a clear indication of their willingness and ability to meet the costs of the sizeable investments&#13;
required for a metro system. No Bank involvement is contemplated under the proposed project,&#13;
but depending on the findings of the aforementioned metro study, the Bank may be asked to&#13;
provide technical advice to the District Administration in evaluating possible approaches to&#13;
financing a metro system, including ones that involve a concession to private investors.&#13;
E. Pricing and Cost Recovery&#13;
1.42  Gasoline Pricing. In agreement with the covenants stipulated under the Third National&#13;
Highway Sector Loan (3453-CO), the government has instituted gradual increases in real gasoline&#13;
prices, with the aim of reaching full coverage of road costs through user charges and, at least,&#13;
achieving parity between the yearly average consumption price and the corresponding average of&#13;
the respective border prices. Progress on this matter is being monitored in the context of Loan&#13;
3453-CO.The consumer price (currently at about US$0.90 per gallon for both gasoline and diesel)&#13;
is above the border price (US$0.60 for gasoline and US$0.69 for diesel). The tax component in&#13;
the price of transport fuels is about US$0.36 equivalent per gallon. With other user charges such&#13;
as road tolls, this has been sufficient to fund the expenditures of the nationally managed highway&#13;
and rural roads system.&#13;
1.43 Local Finance. During the last decade, the District achieved a level of fiscal self-reliance&#13;
matched by few municipalities in the region. In decreasing order of importance, its main local&#13;
sources of revenues are taxes on: commerce and industry, property, beer sales, and an annual&#13;
stamp tax on cars. Transfers from the national government accounted for about 10% of revenues.&#13;
Current revenues increased in real terms by about 5% per year between 1985 and 1989 to a level&#13;
of US$217 million equivalent, while current savings grew at 9% per year to US$86 million over&#13;
the same period. However, this positive trend was not sustained in 1990, an election year, in&#13;
which savings fell to US$ 60 million, as revenues, though not expenditures, failed to keep pace&#13;
with high inflation. In 1991, the District took corrective measures to cut costs, including&#13;
workforce reductions in the solid waste company and disbanding of EDTU, and to improve&#13;
revenues, mostly through collection of overdue tax payments and the billing of betterment levies.&#13;
However failure to implement the betterment levies until August 1993 negatively affected the&#13;
District's financial performance, and further increased the financial deficit in 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
1.44  In July 1993, the national Government issued a decree establishing a special regime for the&#13;
District. Decree 1421 (see para. 1.20) reassigned various responsibilities within the District and&#13;
provided greater executive control to the Mayor. This decree also allowed the District to use a&#13;
wider range of revenue-raising instruments, such as gasoline surtaxes, road tolls, and betterment&#13;
levies. In August 1993, upon approval of the Statute, the District implemented various fiscal&#13;
reform measures such as a self-valuation system for the property tax and bi-monthly billing for the&#13;
commerce and industry tax. Collection of these taxes was also significantly strengthened by the&#13;
adoption of a stringent fiscal regime, similar to the National Tax Regime. In addition, in the case&#13;
of the property tax, a change in the method of computing the declared assessed value, together&#13;
with the new self-valuation procedures resulted in an increase in the number of taxpayers by&#13;
100,000 and an increase in revenue close to twice that of 1993, in real terms. In 1994, the solid&#13;
waste utility, which was a significant drain on municipal resources, was disbanded and the service&#13;
was entirely entrusted to the private sector. The combination of the above led to an increase in&#13;
revenue of nearly 70% in real terms and boosted savings' to US$ 250 million. This positive trend&#13;
appears to be consolidating as indicated by preliminary results up to mid-1995. A 13% surtax on&#13;
gasoline (increasing 1% annually to 15% by 1997) which would be primarily used for street&#13;
maintenance has been approved by the City Council. Encouraged by these results, and based on&#13;
medium term financial projections, the District has recently approved an ambitious investment&#13;
plan for 1995-1998. In sum, with the new Statute, the District administration has acquired the&#13;
legal basis for confronting the deterioration of its financial performance and the backlog in the&#13;
rehabilitation of the city's infrastructure. While the District is approaching its short, medium, and&#13;
long-term planning in a rational manner based on appropriate studies and clearly defined financial&#13;
sources, political pressures could lead to over-commitment of resources for long-term projects&#13;
such as the metro.&#13;
1.45  The District's savings could still be further enhanced by (a) widening the revenue base,&#13;
especially for the property tax; (b) strengthening financial management, through better fiscal&#13;
information systems and enhancing the mechanism for financial planning and budget control; (c)&#13;
reducing evasion and fraud in the collection of taxes and levies; and (d) stemming the growth of&#13;
current expenditures, mostly by scaling down the District's overdimensioned workforce and&#13;
allowing the private sector to perform many of the functions now performed by the District.&#13;
F. Issues and Strategy&#13;
1.46 The equivalent of 2% of Colombia's GDP is spent moving people and goods within&#13;
Bogota in a chaotic and inefficient manner. Congestion exacts a high human and environmental&#13;
toil and undermines the efficiency of the urban economy. The poor are worse off as they travel&#13;
longer average distances using less flexible modes. Demands on the street network will increase&#13;
as the population grows and users shift from buses to cars. Addressing these pressures through&#13;
I  Difference between current revenues and current expenditures plus debt service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
only network expansion would require larger investments than the city can afford and it promotes&#13;
a resource-inefficient pattern of urban development which encourages urban sprawl in the&#13;
environmentally sensitive surroundings of Bogota. A high priority should thus be given to&#13;
developing an effective high-volume public transport system.&#13;
1.47  While a metro system is envisaged as a long-term element in the plan to adequately&#13;
respond to the needs of residents, the short-term focus upon strategic trunk lines with busways&#13;
and parallel institutional changes to better manage the sector are key elements in the plan of the&#13;
current administration. The success of the Avenida Caracas busway (para. 1.15) also attests to&#13;
the merits of following this strategy within the framework described in this report.&#13;
1.48  Transport Strategy. The District's short and medium-term transport strategy is to (a)&#13;
restructure the institutional framework to make it more accountable and responsive to sector&#13;
needs; (b) optimize the capacity and use of existing infrastructure facilities through traffic&#13;
management and focusing on major transit corridors; (c) target new investments toward removal&#13;
of bottlenecks and improvement of access to low-income areas; (d) promote public transport by&#13;
giving buses adequate facilities including separating bus and car flows where appropriate; (e) use&#13;
normative and regulatory powers as tools to promote greater sector efficiency; and (f) promote&#13;
the participation of the private sector in concessions such as BOTs for the design, construction,&#13;
operation and maintenance of mass transit projects, parking facilities, and expressways.&#13;
1.49  Institutions. Implementing this strategy will require a strong institutional structure and&#13;
the capacity for great flexibility. The initial steps for a comprehensive restructuring and&#13;
consolidation of the District's transport agencies have already been taken (paras. 1.24-1.26). As&#13;
discussed earlier, this may also entail a redistribution of functions, including contracting several of&#13;
these functions out to the private sector.&#13;
1.50  Finance. Bogota is one of few capital cities in the world which finance their&#13;
infrastructure and local services from local revenues, without major transfers from the central&#13;
government. This self-reliance should be preserved as it promotes regional equity, avoids a large&#13;
drain on the national budget, and links the cost of urban programs closely to user charges.&#13;
However, it calls for a sustained effort of resource mobilization and a tight management of&#13;
expenditures; and in this regard, there is room for improvement in several areas. The District&#13;
needs an increased and sustainable resource base to develop, operate and maintain its&#13;
infrastructure system without neglecting urgent needs in the social sectors. The combined effects&#13;
of increased property tax collection, concessions, staff restructuring and similar measures should&#13;
assist to improve the finance and management system.&#13;
G. Bank Experience and Strategy&#13;
1.51   Although the Bank has played a major role in developing the inter-urban transport system&#13;
in Colombia (lending about US$ 887 million for 12 highway projects), until now, it has financed&#13;
no urban transport project in the country. It has also invested about US$650 million in urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
infrastructure projects, including five loans totaling US$306 million for water supply projects in&#13;
Bogota. While these projects are not directly related to the BogotA Transport project, the lessons&#13;
of PCRs for the completed projects have been taken into account. The proposed project has&#13;
been kept simple in its structure to avoid inter-institutional implementational problems. It has also&#13;
been prepared in such a way to allow for follow-up phases, should the need arise. Similarly, to&#13;
avoid counterpart funding problems, the loan is relatively small and manageable. The experience&#13;
of urban transport projects in other Latin American countries was also considered. The proposed&#13;
project is similar in design to the successful First Urban Transport Project in Brazil (Loan 1563-&#13;
BR). Lessons from sector experience in the region are that: (a) beneficiary agencies should&#13;
mobilize resources to adequately fund the operation and maintenance of project facilities; and (b)&#13;
institutional reforms critical to project objectives should take place early in the project calendar.&#13;
1.52  Bank assistance to Colombia aims to enhance the competitiveness of the productive&#13;
sectors with a greater role for local authorities and the private sector and special efforts to&#13;
alleviate poverty. In the cities, these objectives can be pursued through projects improving the&#13;
efficiency and productivity of urban systems and the delivery of basic services to low-income&#13;
communities. On-going urban infrastructure operations include a Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Sector Project (Loan 2961-CO) and a Municipal Development Project (Loan 3336-CO). Both&#13;
support a greater financial self-reliance at the municipal level and the development of local&#13;
institutions capable of efficiently operating municipal services.&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin&#13;
2.1    The Public Sector Expenditure Review of 1987 first defined a framework for possible&#13;
urban transport operations in BogotA and other Colombian cities. Subsequently, the 1993&#13;
Country Strategy Paper identified the need to address large-city congestion and included the&#13;
Project in the FY93-FY96 lending program. The proposed project was initially entered into the&#13;
Bank's lending program in June 1989, and first appraised in June 1990. A post-appraisal mission&#13;
was carried out in December 1990 after the District restructured the role of some sector agencies,&#13;
and negotiations were held in July 1991. After negotiations, the District's failure to implement the&#13;
proposed betterment levies and its deteriorating financial perfornance led the Bank and the&#13;
national government to postpone processing the project. In November 1992, the District Council&#13;
approved a new plan of betterment levies and its implementation was initiated in August 1993. In&#13;
this new context, the District and the national government requested a re-appraisal of the project&#13;
and its processing, to which the Bank agreed in light of the commitment to achieve a sound&#13;
financial performance. Further difficulties in resolving the District's debt to the GOC as well as in&#13;
obtaining council authorization for the Mayor to sign the loan, led to suspension of loan&#13;
processing for a second time. It was only in February 1995 that the loan processing resumed after&#13;
the newly-elected Mayor of Bogota requested this and a re-appraisal mission found that the above&#13;
issues had been satisfactorily resolved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.2   Transport problems in Bogota are listed by residents as the second most important area of&#13;
concern (next to crime). While the Bank has made loans to help develop the water supply and&#13;
power sectors of Bogota, it has not yet provided assistance to address the critical constraints&#13;
imposed by an inadequate transport system on the city's development and the welfare of its&#13;
residents, especially the poor. The proposed project would help the District Government to&#13;
provide basic services in an efficient and sustainable manner. The District has demonstrated its&#13;
commitment to the sector by the steps that have been taken by the current mayor to carry out an&#13;
institutional reform program, in order to establish a framework which would be better able to&#13;
address the long-term investment needs of the city in the urban transport sector. These include&#13;
initiatives to consolidate and streamline the operations of the various sector entities, privatization&#13;
of several functions and adoption of a policy aimed at promoting public mass transit modes with&#13;
strategic investments to help maximize use of existing facilities.&#13;
2.3   This operation with a subnational government will not address national transport sector&#13;
issues such as user charges and gasoline pricing, which are the object of a continuing dialogue&#13;
between the Bank and the government in the context of the Third National Highway Sector Loan&#13;
(3453-CO). However, the project is expected to have a significant demonstration effect upon&#13;
other large municipalities in the country and it could become the first phase in a broader Bank-&#13;
assisted program in the urban transport sector.&#13;
C. Objectives&#13;
2.4   The project would help finance priority investments in support of the transport strategy&#13;
and institutional reforms adopted by the District. Its objectives are to (a) improve major transport&#13;
corridors by rationalizing vehicle flows and upgrading environmental conditions for users (b)&#13;
promote the use of public transport and of non-motorized transport modes; (c) facilitate public&#13;
transport access to areas with low income population; (d) extend the life of the road&#13;
infrastructure; and (e) strengthen the District's institutions in charge of planning, managing and&#13;
maintaining the transport infrastructure.&#13;
D. Description&#13;
2.5   The project would support selected infrastructure investments. It would include the&#13;
following components: (A) traffic management and transport corridors (57% of base costs); (B)&#13;
access roads for low-income settlements (10%); (C) road maintenance (27%); and (D)&#13;
institutional support measures (6%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
2.6    Component A - Traffic Management and Transport Corridors. This component, to&#13;
be executed by IDU (Part A. 1) and FONDATT (Part A.2), would include:&#13;
A. 1   Works, equipment, and consultant services to carry out corridor subprojects,&#13;
consisting of an integrated program of least-cost investments, supported by&#13;
administrative measures, to improve transport flows (including dedicated lanes for&#13;
buses, car traffic and non-motorized transport) in major transit corridors and their&#13;
areas of influence; and&#13;
A.2   Equipment, training and consultant services to assist the entities to carry out their&#13;
mandate. The areas of focus would include: (a) a citizens education program; (b)&#13;
computers, software, equipment and vehicles for FONDATT, STT's planning&#13;
department and the busways operations unit; (c) training of the traffic police and&#13;
other transport sector professionals; (d) traffic count and transport surveys; and (e)&#13;
assistance in transport planning and policy studies covering bottlenecks in existing&#13;
road design; non-motorized transport; public transport system; parking; traffic&#13;
signals, and accident reporting and analysis.&#13;
2.7    Component B - Access Roads. This component will be executed by IDU and would&#13;
include:&#13;
B. 1   Infrastructure Investments comprising: designs, works and supervision to pave and&#13;
upgrade roads of a total length of about 30 km to improve public transport access&#13;
into low-income areas; and&#13;
B.2   Support to IDU aimed at strengthening its overall project execution capabilities&#13;
and financial planning.&#13;
2.8    Component C - Road Maintenance. SOP will execute this component which will&#13;
include:&#13;
C. 1   Road Rehabilitation works comprising: designs, civil works and supervision for a&#13;
program to repair or rebuild about 400 lane-km of arterials and secondary roads&#13;
used by public transport, including the walkways, bikeways and green areas along&#13;
the right-of-way of these roads; and&#13;
C.2   Planning, management and quality control of the rehabilitation program; development&#13;
and implementation of a pavement information system; and development of standards&#13;
and manuals for pavement design and maintenance.&#13;
2.9    Component D -Institutional Support. This component will be administered by the&#13;
Finance Secretariat (SHB), and would include:&#13;
D. I   Sectoral Technical Assistance consisting of equipment and consulting services&#13;
to assist with on-going borrower's transport sectoral reform to (a) reorganize the transport&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
authority; (b) define functional organization and participation of the private sector; (c)&#13;
implement the new sectoral organization; and (d) train borrower's professional staffing,&#13;
connection with their activities under the new system&#13;
D.2   Support to DAMA consisting of technical assistance and training to help develop and&#13;
establish local environmental guidelines for such problems as noise pollution and tire, battery&#13;
and waste oil disposal in the sector and to design and implement the required regulations.&#13;
D.3   Support to SHB in the form of equipment and professional services for&#13;
(a) auditing, monitoring and coordination of the project; (b) development&#13;
of an information system for investment budgeting and monitoring; and (c)&#13;
upgrading of the tax collection system;&#13;
E. Selection and Programming of Investments&#13;
2.10   Corridor Subprojects (Part A. 1). About 35% of the total project cost would support&#13;
investment and traffic management activities to improve traffic flows along the Calle 80 and other&#13;
corridors which IDU will select before December, 1999, based on the criteria described below.&#13;
This component includes such measures as widening of street sections, reserving two lanes in&#13;
each direction of the Calle 80 for bus traffic, signaling, remodeling ofjunctions, one-way traffic&#13;
systems, parking restrictions, modification of bus-stop systems and changes to bus routes&#13;
arrangements for traffic diversion during subproject execution. The Calle 80 works would&#13;
improve the throughput of the street system between Av. Caracas and Carrera 112. The other&#13;
subprojects would support traffic management activities and minor infrastructure works to&#13;
improve the operation of the Av. Caracas busway (para. 1.15) and other transport corridors.&#13;
Feasibility studies for the Calle 80 subproject were reviewed by the Bank during re-appraisal and&#13;
found to be satisfactory.&#13;
2.11   The selection criteria which were used for the Calle 80 and which would also be used for&#13;
the other corridors to be selected are: (a) the corridors have to support high bus passenger flows&#13;
(at least 10,000 passengers per hour); (b) each subproject should emphasize improvements of bus&#13;
and non-motorized transport flows and should have an integrated, least-cost analysis of the&#13;
corridor and its area of influence; (c) negative environmental impacts, if any, are to be addressed&#13;
by mitigation measures to be included in the subproject; and (d) the investments should present&#13;
rates of return (IERR) not less than 12%. In those cases where project works involve land&#13;
acquisition or displacement of residents and/or street vendors, such actions have to comply with&#13;
the appropriate Bank environment, resettlement and compensation policies (para 2.43 contains&#13;
greater details on this topic).&#13;
2.12  Access Roads Program (Part B.1). Under this component, existing access roads would&#13;
be upgraded to improve the accessibility of the low-income population to the public transport&#13;
system. Acceptance criteria are that each road should: (a) be targeted at improving public&#13;
transport access into existing low-income settlements; (b) use least-cost designs and pavement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
technologies; (c) include a signed agreement with the community which would undertake to&#13;
provide routine maintenance (e.g. cleaning debris and weeds) and prevent misuse of the facilities&#13;
(e.g. for storing materials, constructing structures, etc.); (d) not present substantial risks of&#13;
inducing urban encroachment in environmentally sensitive areas; and (e), not result in the&#13;
displacement or resettlement of people. IDU currently has a program to upgrade about sixty&#13;
access roads. In 1994, it upgraded thirteen of these. The April re-appraisal mission reviewed&#13;
IDU's design and plans for future access roads and suggested several engineering and&#13;
administrative measures aimed at making them more accessible and with more systematic&#13;
maintenance. IDU has incorporated these in the design and it currently has about thirteen-access&#13;
roads ready for implementation. IDU's access road program was reviewed by the Bank and&#13;
found to be acceptable based upon the selection criteria listed above.&#13;
2.13  Road Maintenance (Part C.1). Part C. I supports a three-year plan of road rehabilitation&#13;
and reconstruction works. The complete plan was reviewed by the Bank at re-appraisal, and&#13;
investments were tentatively grouped into annual programs based on road condition, giving&#13;
special priority to roads used by public transport vehicles. All rehabilitation and reconstruction&#13;
works would be carried out by private contractors.&#13;
2.14  A preliminary computerized inventory of road sections was established for project&#13;
preparation. Technical assistance will be provided to help SOP develop this inventory into a&#13;
permanent pavement management system, to be used for programming and budgeting of road&#13;
maintenance. SOP would present to the Bank each year by March 31, a maintenance program for&#13;
the following year, based on an updated inventory of road condition. Eligible expenditures under&#13;
Part C. 1 would only be those related to annual programs approved by the Bank. The first-year&#13;
programn was reviewed at re-appraisal. Acceptance criteria for subsequent annual programs&#13;
would be: (i) investment ranking based on economic priority; (ii) consistency with Component A&#13;
investments; and (iii) efficient packaging for procurement. Priority would also be given to roads&#13;
used by public transport vehicles.&#13;
2.15  Consistency of Sector Investments. The reorganization and consolidation of functions&#13;
of the sector entities is expected to improve efficiency and greatly improve coordination of sector&#13;
investments. Under the new structure, investments would be reviewed within a coherent overall&#13;
program within which clear priorities would be agreed upon and established.&#13;
2.16 Availability of Designs. IDU, with the assistance of FONDATT, will complete&#13;
engineering designs for all of its subprojects under Component A. 1 by the end of 1996 (see&#13;
Annex 6).&#13;
F. Costs and Financing&#13;
2.17  The total investment cost is estimated at US$141.0 million equivalent, including physical&#13;
and price contingencies estimated at US$22.8 million equivalent and import duties and VAT&#13;
estimated at US$16.7 million. Cost tables are presented in Annex 4 and summarized in Table II. 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
2.18  The financing plan is shown in Table 11.2. The proposed Bank loan of US$65 million&#13;
would cover about 46% of estimated investment costs, equivalent to 100% of foreign currency&#13;
costs and 14% of local costs. Partial Bank financing of local costs is proposed to maintain a Bank&#13;
financing presence in the following components with a sizable local cost component (a) the labor-&#13;
intensive access road program, which has a strong poverty focus; and (b) the institutional&#13;
development activities, to ensure that they would not be postponed in the possible event of delays&#13;
in the mobilization of counterpart funds.&#13;
2.19  Counterpart funds would be provided by the District through SIB for all four&#13;
components. IDU will be the executing agency for components Al and B, FONDATT for&#13;
component A2, SIB via SOP for component C, and SIB (individually, and through DAMA) for&#13;
component D. All the institutions would be responsible for non-eligible expenditures including&#13;
taxes and duties.&#13;

G. Implementation&#13;
2.20 Agency Responsibilities. The District would be the borrower and SHB would have&#13;
overall responsibility for project implementation. IDU would execute Part A. 1 and Component B,&#13;
FONDATT Part A.2, and SOP Component C. The District would execute Component D through&#13;
its Finance Secretariat (and through DAMA). SHB, which would house the project coordinating&#13;
unit, would be responsible for the overall administration of the project and loan. Subsidiary&#13;
agreements would be signed with SHB and the executing agencies to set forth the technical,&#13;
financial and all other responsibilities relating to implementation of the project. These subsidiary&#13;
agreements were discussed and agreed at negotiations, and formalization of these agreements&#13;
would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan. Strengthening measures are included in the&#13;
project to ensure that these agencies will have sufficient capabilities to discharge their&#13;
responsibilities under the project.&#13;
2.21   Supervision Program (Annexes 3 and 6). To ensure a timely implementation of key&#13;
project and institutional development tasks, an implementation chart has been agreed upon and&#13;
updated at project re-appraisal. It sets forth dates to start and complete the various project&#13;
components, including the studies on institutional reform, sector strengthening, and traffic&#13;
management.&#13;
2.22 Project Coordinating and Monitoring Unit. To assure the timely implementation of the&#13;
project, a small project coordinating and monitoring unit has been established within SHB (Annex&#13;
5). This unit consists of a project coordinator (who was appointed in October 1995), assisted by&#13;
two experts in project implementation, along with technical/administrative support. It will have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
resources to contract part-time assistance (i.e. specialists on legal, procurement and other support&#13;
matters when these services are required). TOR's for the two experts have been approved by the&#13;
Bank and the establishment of the unit (i.e hiring of the experts and other staff) is underway.&#13;
Maintenance of this unit will be a loan condition.&#13;
2.23 Road Maintenance. Within SOP, the planning and overall quality control of the road&#13;
maintenance program would be handled by a permanent pavement management group supported&#13;
by technical assistance under the project. This group could later become the core of the road&#13;
maintenance division in the future reorganized transport authority.&#13;
2.24  Technical Assistance. Draft terms of reference for all major studies are in the project&#13;
files, with summaries presented in Annex 3. Under the new Statute (see para. 1.20) the handling&#13;
of the technical assistance can be quickly undertaken by the respective District executing agencies&#13;
with assistance from UNDP, if required, without cumbersome processes involving approvals of&#13;
the agencies' boards of directors or the District Council. With the support of the project&#13;
coordinating unit, each institution will contract and manage the technical assistance tasks in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
H. Procurement&#13;
2.25  Procurement would be handled by (a) IDU for Part A. 1 and Component B; (b)&#13;
FONDATT for Part A.2; (c) SHB through SOP, for Component C; and (d) the District's central&#13;
administration through its Finance Secretariat (SHB) for Component D (Table II.3). A recent&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Review has concluded that Colombia's Law 80 has&#13;
implications on project executing activities, particularly with respect to the transparency and&#13;
confidentiality aspects of procurement. In view of this, the Bank's specific provisions for NCB&#13;
have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement and all procurement aspects were discussed and&#13;
confirmed at negotiations. Although the implementing agencies have ample experience in&#13;
procuring the items included in the project, to further ensure the application of the Bank's&#13;
guidelines and practices and assist the implementing agencies in these matters, the project&#13;
monitoring and coordinating unit will have resources to contract a procurement specialist (para.&#13;
2.22).&#13;
2.26 Procurement of goods and services under the proposed project will be in accordance with&#13;
the Bank Guidelines for Procurement of Goods and Works (January 1995) and Bank Guidelines&#13;
for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). Project agencies would use standard bidding&#13;
documents issued by the Bank for procurement of goods and works by International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) and the sample forms of contract for consultant services will be used for&#13;
consultants' contracts. In the case of procurement of goods and works by National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB), bidding documents that have been agreed in advance with the Bank, would be&#13;
used. Any modifications to the Bank's standard bidding documents for ICB will require the prior&#13;
review and approval of the Bank. A breakdown of civil works, goods and services for the project&#13;
to be procured by ICB, NCB and other methods is presented in Table II.3.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
2.27   ICB would be used for civil works contracts in excess of US$5 million and for goods&#13;
contracts above US$250,000. Under ICB for goods, local manufacturers would be granted a&#13;
margin of preference in accordance with Bank guidelines. NCB procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank would be used for works contracts between US$350,000 and US$5 million, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$60 million. National shopping (and international shopping for&#13;
specialized equipment) with at least three quotations would be used for goods contracts with&#13;
estimated costs less than US$50,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$0.5 million. Small&#13;
works, estimated to cost less than US$350,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$2&#13;
million, will be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations&#13;
obtained from three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation. No force account&#13;
works are included in the project. All the institutions will be responsible for non-eligible&#13;
expenditures including taxes.&#13;
2.28  To ensure economies of scale in execution and wide competition, all civil works under&#13;
Components A and C would be packaged, to the extent possible, in contracts not lower than&#13;
US$2 million. This would not apply to Component B (access roads) which involves a number of&#13;
small investments using labor-intensive technologies suitable for execution by small enterprises.&#13;
Computers and software would be packaged to the extent possible to allow ICB. Specialized&#13;
equipment (communications equipment) and vehicles would be packaged into contracts of more&#13;
than $50,000 and procured through LIB from suppliers with local service and maintenance&#13;
facilities, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million.&#13;
2.29 The Bank's prior review of procurement documentation will cover all major procurement&#13;
steps (terms of references, bidding documents, evaluation report, award recommendation and&#13;
contract) and would apply to:&#13;
&#149; All contracts procured under ICB and LIB;&#13;
a  All contracts procured under NCB for works irrespective of size, and all contracts US$0.5&#13;
million and above;&#13;
*  All terms of reference for consulting assignments;&#13;
*  All consulting services contracts provided by firms and estimated to cost US$100,000&#13;
equivalent or more;&#13;
*  All consulting services contracts provided by firms, in the case of single-source selection;&#13;
*  All consulting services contracts provided by individual consultants greater than $50,000;&#13;
*  All consulting services (including training) relating to assignments of a critical nature or&#13;
determined by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
* All amendments to consulting services contracts provided by firms which raise the total&#13;
contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or more; and&#13;
* All amendments to consulting services contracts provided by individual consultants which&#13;
raise the total contract value to US$50,000 equivalent or more;&#13;
2.30  All other procurement of goods or works will be reviewed by the Bank ex-post on a&#13;
sample basis. Thus prior review will involve about 80% of Bank-financed contracts. Civil works&#13;
of Component B (para. 2.12) have been specifically designed to be of a modest scale, suitable for&#13;
execution by small enterprises, and will be reviewed ex-post on a sample basis.&#13;
I. Disbursements&#13;
2.31   Standard disbursement profiles for the transport sector for Bank projects show&#13;
disbursement schedules of 7.5 years for the Latin America region, and 7 years in the case of&#13;
Colombia. The disbursement schedule of the proposed Bank loan has been set at six years.&#13;
However, it is expected that the actual period would be much shorter because of: (i) the modest&#13;
scale of the investment components in the proposed project compared with the annual investment&#13;
program of the implementing institutions (the project is expected to be about 2% of the 1996-&#13;
2000 investment program); (ii) the state of preparedness of the implementing agencies to carry&#13;
out the proposed activities; and (iii) the urgency of the investments proposed under the loan.&#13;
Table 11.4 and Annex 7 present the estimated disbursement schedule. The project completion&#13;
date will be June 30, 2001, with the closing date, December 31, 2001. Loan proceeds would be&#13;
disbursed against the following percentages of eligible expenditures: (a) for works 45% for Al,&#13;
B 1, and C 1; (b) 50% for goods; and (c) 1 00% for services. Eligible expenditures under Part C. I&#13;
would be only those pertaining to annual programs approved by the Bank (for road maintenance).&#13;
2.32  Disbursements for eligible expenditures (i) under civil works contracts valued below&#13;
US$1,000,000; (ii) under goods contracts below US$250,000; and (iii) underconsultant services&#13;
contracts valued at less than US$ 100,000 in the case of firms, valued at less than US$50,000 in&#13;
the case of individuals, relating to assignments of a non-critical nature as determined by the Bank,&#13;
and not involving single-source selection of firms would be made against Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). Retroactive financing not exceeding US$ 4.0 million would be provided&#13;
for eligible expenditures, civil works, engineering and consultant services for sub-project studies&#13;
and for project administration approved by the Bank and incurred between May 1, 1995 and&#13;
signing of the loan agreement. To facilitate project implementation, the District would establish,&#13;
open, and maintain a Special Account in US dollars in the Central Bank. The authorized&#13;
allocation for the Special Account would be US$ 2.5 million, which reflects the average 4-month&#13;
Bank disbursement expected. The Bank would initially deposit up to US$1.5 million upon receipt&#13;
of an initial withdrawal application. This could be later increased up to the authorized allocation,&#13;
once cumulative disbursement from the loan reach US$7 million.&#13;

J. Audits, Reports, and Monitoring&#13;
2.33  Audits. The District and its executing agencies would each maintain records and separate&#13;
project accounts for the components under its responsibility, and would have them audited&#13;
annually by independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank. The scope of the audits would&#13;
include the adequacy of the accounting systems and internal controls, the operations of the&#13;
Special Account and the reliability of SOE's as a basis for loan disbursements. Audit reports&#13;
would be provided to the Bank within four months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
2.34  Reports. The District would present to the Bank annual project reports and brief&#13;
progress updates every six months. The annual reports, to be submitted to the Bank before May&#13;
31 each year starting in 1996 a month before the annual review (see below), would (i) describe&#13;
progress of procurement, physical investments, technical assistance, and the overall pace of&#13;
project implementation (Annex 3); (ii) present actual values of agreed monitoring indicators&#13;
(Annex 6), compare them with appraisal targets and discuss differences; (iii) propose remedial&#13;
actions in case of unsatisfactory progress; (iv) present projected investments and financing needs&#13;
including counterpart funding per entity for the year the report is prepared and the following year;&#13;
and (v) describe on-going developments in the sector relevant to the project. The District would&#13;
submit an implementation completion report (ICR) to the Bank within six months after the closing&#13;
date of the loan.&#13;
2.35  Annual Reviews. On the basis of the progress and audit reports, the District and the&#13;
Bank would carry out each year by June 30 starting in 1996 a joint review of project progress,&#13;
including pace and quality of execution, investment programming and budgeting, counterpart&#13;
funding, compliance with loan covenants, and sector developments with relevance to the project.&#13;
The review would be an opportunity to discuss and finalize the annual programs and subprojects&#13;
presented for Bank approval. In case of unsatisfactory progress the reviews would lead to the&#13;
formulation of adjustments and, if necessary, remedial actions satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
K. Financial Impact&#13;
2.36  A financial projection of the District is presented in Annex 8. It shows that the District&#13;
will be able, if it maintains sound financial policies, to provide timely counterpart funding and debt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
service for the project and loan with a substantial margin left for other investments. A sensitivity&#13;
analysis performed to assess the potential impact of variations in the expected performance of&#13;
main fiscal revenues and expenditures shows that the District's financial position would remain&#13;
sound even with a 20% decrease in expected future revenues and a 20% increase in projected&#13;
expenditures for the period 1996-2000. In such an event, the District, however, would have to&#13;
sharply reduce its pace of investment.&#13;
L. Benefits&#13;
2.37  Economic Justification. The project would help to raise the productivity of the urban&#13;
economy by alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks. Substantial direct benefits will arise from&#13;
savings in travel time and vehicle operating and maintenance cost. Such savings will mainly&#13;
result from reduced street congestion, upgraded access roads to employment centers, and road&#13;
maintenance. Vehicle operating cost savings would derive mainly from improved traffic speeds&#13;
and less down time for repairs and maintenance.&#13;
2.38 While some of the non-quantified benefits would not be totally independent of the&#13;
quantified ones (e.g. less accidents reduce delays and congestions), they are significant in their&#13;
own right (i.e. pollution reduction). Long-run institutional benefits are expected to result in the&#13;
enhanced capacity of the municipal administration to manage the urban transport system. It is&#13;
also expected that as access improves, land values in the affected areas would increase, reflecting&#13;
the capital appreciation impact of project-related transport improvements and providing increased&#13;
property tax to the District.&#13;
2.39  The cost and benefits of the major components (excluding component D) of the project&#13;
have been evaluated and the results are summarized in table below. Greater details of the&#13;
economic analysis are given in Annex 9.&#13;

2.40  Poverty Impact. The project is expected to have beneficial impact on large areas of the&#13;
city; however, it is difficult to quantify distributional aspects of these benefits. Cars account for a&#13;
percentage of system costs disproportionate to the population they serve and thus tend to capture&#13;
the bulk of the benefits of most traffic management and road maintenance investments. However,&#13;
the emphasis placed on bus transport in this project ensures a more balanced distribution of&#13;
benefits. The corridor program includes road investments connecting poor areas to employment&#13;
centers, and are mainly aimed at improving public transport flows in these corridors. Maintenance&#13;
priorities have been set taking into account public transport loads. The access road program is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
targeted at low-income settlements, and would provide about 630,000 low-income residents with&#13;
easier access to the opportunities of the city. The poor would also benefit from employment&#13;
generated by project investments. Assuming that about 20% of the project cost would go toward&#13;
unskilled labor, it is estimated that about 5,000 person-years of low-income jobs would arise from&#13;
project works. It should be noted that because some of these works would have been done&#13;
without the project, not all of these jobs could be attributed to it.&#13;
M. Environmental Aspects.&#13;
2.41   Bogota is favored with strong winds, reducing the local impact of pollution generated in&#13;
the city. Nevertheless, air pollution is acute in the less ventilated center-south area, where particle&#13;
concentrations are above acceptable limits for long-term exposure. Air quality improved in the&#13;
80s, partly due to stricter enforcement of emission standards for industrial plants, and because less&#13;
solid-waste is burnt as a result of a higher collection coverage. Pollution from transport,&#13;
however, has increased. Emissions per vehicle-km are high due to low engine efficiency at the&#13;
city's altitude (2,600m), an aging bus fleet, and congestion. Dust from unpaved or broken streets&#13;
is another major pollutant.&#13;
2.42   The project would have a beneficial impact on the environment. Traffic management&#13;
investments would help relieve congestion, resulting in lower emissions of pollutants (such as&#13;
carbon monoxide, particulates, nitrogen dioxides, volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxides)&#13;
to the degree that lower vehicle emissions are not neutralized by a larger fleet use. In the Calle&#13;
80/Calle 68 corridors emissions per vehicle would be reduced by an estimated 12%, representing&#13;
a decrease in particle concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) ranging from 12 to 35 ppm at the&#13;
present level of traffic. The paving or resurfacing of roads would reduce the production of dust.&#13;
The emphasis placed on public transport in the selection of project investments would promote a&#13;
more resource-efficient model of urban development. Non-motorized transport including walking&#13;
and cycling would be promoted. The project also includes technical assistance to help the&#13;
District's Department of the Environment strengthen its operations for establishing and enforcing&#13;
proper disposal of tires, batteries and waste oil and noise abatement regulations.&#13;
2.43  Road works may have some associated adverse impact, mainly relating to quarrying for&#13;
construction materials and disposal of worksite wastes. Measures to mitigate these would be&#13;
specified in bidding documents for works. Environmental specialists have participated in the&#13;
design of project investments and in the selection of the access roads and CAR will also review&#13;
and approve environmental impact assessment studies before works begin (para 1.38). No&#13;
resettlement or displacement of residents is anticipated under the access road component since&#13;
one of the criteria for selecting such roads for paving is that there be no such displacement (para&#13;
2.12). As part of a program promoting citizen responsibility, the District is preparing a plan to&#13;
plant trees along such streets as the Av. Caracas and Calle 80. Because the Calle 80 works would&#13;
be in consolidated neighborhoods, land acquisition would be minimal along the 10 km route, as&#13;
the proposed investments consist mostly of improvements within existing right-of-ways. Still&#13;
there would be need to reach agreement with owners and tenants regarding acquisition of varying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
areas of lots to facilitate lane expansion, walkways, etc. It is expected that about 113 families&#13;
and 164 commercial operations would be affected to varying degrees. The District has prepared a&#13;
resettlement plan, Plan de Restablecimiento de Condiciones Socio-Economicas Iniciales (RCI),&#13;
which was reviewed by the Bank and found to be acceptable. A copy of the document has been&#13;
placed in the Public Information Center.&#13;
N. Risks&#13;
2.44  The main risks are possible delays in project implementation arising from (a)&#13;
reorganization of sector institutions and (b) lack of adequate counterpart funding.&#13;
2.45  The project is designed to address these risks in a number of ways. First, in an overall&#13;
context, the new administration is fully committed to the project, this being one of the priority&#13;
areas where the Mayor has already taken several key steps aimed at addressing various sector&#13;
problems. With regard to the proposed institutional reform, this is currently at an early stage with&#13;
detailed plans still to be formulated. If it is implemented, it is envisaged that this reform would&#13;
greatly benefit the long-term planning capabilities of the District in the transport sector. The&#13;
proposed reorganization is likely to draw on current staff of the existing entities to form the new&#13;
entity, and therefore core staff connected with the project may not change. Since most of the&#13;
project component would be implemented through contracts, many of the problems associated&#13;
with force-account work are not expected to arise. Under the project, technical assistance would&#13;
also be provided to the responsible agencies to perform their tasks. Project investments have been&#13;
also kept to a modest scale, so that resource demands in terms of time and counterpart funds&#13;
would not be great. Additionally, many of the TORs for such areas as traffic management and&#13;
parking system reforms are expected to be substantially completed shortly and be ready by mid-&#13;
1996. Second, with regard to funding, the District is currently working to strengthen its cadaster&#13;
system and to make its revenue base wider through more aggressive revenue enhancement&#13;
measures and upgraded technology. Annual reviews would lead to timely actions to remedy any&#13;
identified shortcomings.&#13;
3. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
3.1   Agreements obtained during negotiations were that:&#13;
(a)   The District would maintain and adequately staff the Project Coordinating Unit in SHB&#13;
(para 2.22);&#13;
(b)   The District, IDU and FONDATT will present a report by May 31, covering progress of&#13;
the project over the previous year, and will carry out, in consultation with the Bank, each year by&#13;
June 30, a review of project and sector progress, and will implement to the satisfaction of the&#13;
Bank any remedial actions recommended by the Bank during the reviews (para 2.35);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
(c)   IDU will carry out its access road component in accordance with the program accepted by&#13;
the Bank (para 2.12);&#13;
(d)   The District, via SOP, will prepare and furnish to the Bank, the proposed road&#13;
maintenance program for the following year (para 2.14);&#13;
(e)   The District can enter into contractual agreements with other entities acceptable to the&#13;
Bank for the purposes of assisting the Borrower in procurement and Technical Assistance&#13;
functions for Part D of the project (para 2.20);&#13;
(f)   With respect to works under Part C. 1 of the Project, the Borrower shall not invite bids for&#13;
the works in question unless detailed engineering works are completed and the Bank has&#13;
satisfactory evidence that no person would be adversely affected by such works or that if the&#13;
works would affect such persons, they have been provided with enforceable rights in line with&#13;
Bank resettlement/compensation policies (paras. 2.11 and 2.43); and&#13;
(g)   For works under B. 1 of the Project, the Borrower shall provide the Bank with satisfactory&#13;
evidence that no person would be adversely affected by such works or that if the works would&#13;

COLOMBIA&#13;
BOGOTA URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
BUSWAYS&#13;
1.    This annex presents a summary description of the existing Avenida Caracas busway,&#13;
the southern section of which was built during 1989-90 and its northern extension, during&#13;
1991-92. The proposed investment in this project includes measures to improve the&#13;
operational performance of this busway. Details are available in the project file.&#13;
Existing Busway&#13;
2.    The Avenida Caracas (see map) is the busiest public transport corridor in Bogota. It&#13;
connects low-income suburbs in the south to the city center and the busy uptown office and&#13;
shopping district in the center-north. In 1989-90, the District implemented a busway scheme&#13;
along the 8km southern section of the Av. Caracas. Before that, car and bus flows were mixed&#13;
and used two-directional three-lane ways separated by a large central divider. Service levels&#13;
were low with speeds of about 12kph. Space for the two new lanes was obtained from the&#13;
central divider and by reducing lane width to a minimum (2.90m for cars and 3.25m for bus&#13;
lanes). The busway comprises two lanes in each direction for the exclusive use of buses and&#13;
two lanes remain in each direction for general traffic. Bus and car lanes are physically&#13;
segregated using small rounded concrete blocks, allowing for fast removal of buses in the event&#13;
of mechanical failure or accident.&#13;
3.    The bus lanes are located in the center of the road. Island bus stops are provided at&#13;
about 450m spacing for passengers to board/alight from buses. To accommodate the high&#13;
number of buses and routes, the length of each stop is 200m. Each bus route is assigned to a&#13;
specific section of the stops, using a color code system for passenger orientation. The stops&#13;
are staggered to save space and avoid excessive concentrations of pedestrians. Passenger&#13;
access to/from stops is via pedestrian crossings controlled by signals, sometimes associated&#13;
with the traffic signals at junctions. Bus shelters and pedestrian protection fences have been&#13;
built, although some remain to be completed. The timing of traffic signals has been improved.&#13;
Signals are not bus-activated or related to bus movements, as flows are continuous and car&#13;
traffic must also be accommodated. Left turns are prohibited from the car lanes, but not at&#13;
most junctions from the bus lanes. Bus volumes in different sections of the avenue used to be&#13;
uneven, as many cross routes used the avenue for only a few blocks. An important part of the&#13;
project consisted of measures to re-assign bus routes resulting in a smoother load profile and&#13;
eliminating bottlenecks.&#13;
4.    At the maximum load points in peak hours, the busway carries about 573 buses per&#13;
hour in one direction. Flows of up to 30,000 passengers per direction at peak hour have been&#13;
measured, more than on most busways and light railways worldwide. Prior to the project, the&#13;
maximum number of passengers moved in the corridor was 19,000. Bus speed is above 20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                Annex I&#13;
kmn/hour in peak periods, compared with the original 12 kph prior to the project. In the case of&#13;
general traffic, the speed increased from 13 kph to 24 kph. This high performance level is&#13;
achieved without grade-separated crossings, as the southem section of the avenue has few&#13;
intersections and cross traffic is limited. There are, however, some intersections where the&#13;
speed decreases due to design problems.&#13;
5.    The initial appraisal of the project included an 8-km extension of the Southem busway&#13;
to the North. This subproject was constructed by the District while the project was put on&#13;
hold due to the deterioration of the finances of the municipality. At re-appraisal this&#13;
subproject was replaced by measures to improve operational efficiency at intersections and in&#13;
key areas along the entire busway and for an extension of the busway along the Calle 80.&#13;
6.    Proposed measures included in the subproject are:&#13;
(a)   reorganization of bus routes to reduce bus volumes on Av. Caracas North to&#13;
about 450 buses per hour; minibuses will be diverted to other parallel routes on&#13;
which bus stops will be organized, provided and/or rationalized;&#13;
(b)   re-configuration of the road network within the corridor, primarily by the&#13;
rationalization of one-way systems;&#13;
(c)   traffic management works on Av. Caracas North and on all other roads in the&#13;
corridor to increase the traffic efficiency through measures including (i)&#13;
junction improvements (prohibition of left tums in conjunction with the Av.&#13;
Caracas North busway, optimization of traffic signals, introduction of new&#13;
traffic signals, minor junction improvements such as channelization); (ii) on&#13;
street parking controls; (iii) minor curb realignment and road rehabilitation to&#13;
allow full road width to be brought into operation; and (iv) pedestrian facilities&#13;
(crossings and footpaths);&#13;
(d)   small scale bus terminals to permit buses to stop, wait and tum off the main&#13;
routes; and&#13;
(e)    measures to address major traffic bottlenecks, especially the Plaza Los Heroes&#13;
at the north end of the new busway, where grade separation will be&#13;
implemented.&#13;
7.    In addition, another subproject includes the construction of a busway system along&#13;
Calle 80 and complementary measures on its corridor (Calle 68 and transverse streets from&#13;
Plaza Los Heroes to Carrera 112). The traffic management measures are similar to those in (c)&#13;
above and also include the construction of one overpass in Calle 68 with Avenida Boyaca and&#13;
the reorganization of bus routes and terminals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33                                Annex I&#13;
Operation&#13;
8.       The Av. Caracas busway started to operate in June 1990. During the appraisal&#13;
mission its performance was satisfactory, although some deteroration could be observed due&#13;
to lack of follow-up measures (and, from March 1992 to April 1993, the shutting down of&#13;
traffic-light operations during day-time periods as part of national energy-savings measures).&#13;
Maintenance had also been insufficient. The experience of two years of operations confirmed&#13;
that the busway provides substantial benefits even without many complementary measures, but&#13;
that operating conditions and safety can be greatly enhanced with a permanent effort to&#13;
monitor and enforce its operating rules (such as the proper use of stops by bus driver and safe&#13;
pedestrian crossing). It was therefore decided that the District's Secretariat for Transport&#13;
would establish a permanent organizational unit to oversee the operation of busways. The unit&#13;
was legally created within STT by Decree 265 of May 1991, but its operation has been&#13;
unsatisfactory because of inadequate financial resources and lack of equipment and personnel.&#13;
Environmental Aspects.&#13;
9.    Both, operational improvements on the Av. Caracas busway and the Calle 80 will have&#13;
a generally beneficial environmental impact. A reduction of severe congestion and high levels&#13;
of vehicle exhausts has already been experienced along the Av. Caracas corridor. The project&#13;
will further relieve congestion levels along this corridor and the Calle 80/Calle 68 corridor. In&#13;
the Calle 80/Calle 68 cornidors, emissions per vehicle would be reduced by an estimated 12%,&#13;
representing a decrease in particle concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) ranging from 12 to&#13;
35 ppm at the present level of traffic.&#13;
10.   In both the Calle 80 and the Calle 68 corridors, the number of trees is presently rather&#13;
limited. The project includes measures, including planting of trees along the Calle 80 and Calle&#13;
68 corridors, to ensure a satisfactory insertion of the busways and traffic engineering&#13;
investments in the urban environment. While the measures increase the cost of the subprojects,&#13;
they are expected to improve their image with the users and residents. Experience from the&#13;
existing busways suggests that their benefits are not always sustained due to a poor perception&#13;
by users and local authorities; such measures can, therefore, be an important factor for the&#13;
long-term technical success of the busway and traffic engineering schemes.&#13;

COLOMBIA&#13;
BOGOTA URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ORGAN1ZATION OF THE SECTOR&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    As a result of the decentralization laws of 1986-88, the District of Bogota assumed&#13;
responsibility for transport, including planning, financing and execution of investments,&#13;
regulation of traffic and parking, supervision of public transport, vehicle inspection, licensing of&#13;
cars and drivers, and enforcement of traffic law. The national government formerly through its&#13;
Transport Institute (INTRA) and currently, through the Ministry of Transport, still establishes&#13;
legal standards for vehicle safety while Congress sets the maximum levels of vehicle taxation,&#13;
though it delegates the billing to the municipios. The national government also regulates inter-&#13;
municipal public transport. All other functions pertaining to the sector are now decentralized.&#13;
Before 1986, the role of District agencies in traffic management was little more than the day-&#13;
to-day execution of instructions received from central agencies such as IDTRA. As a result,&#13;
the District did not develop a strong capacity for traffic management and other related&#13;
functions and the administrative structure and staff mix of its sector agencies has been mostly&#13;
geared to routine work such as enforcement.&#13;
2.    To discharge its new functions, in 1986, the District created a Department for Traffic&#13;
and Transport (DATT) as part of its central administration. DATT was assigned responsibility&#13;
for licensing vehicles and drivers, overseeing public transport services, enforcing traffic law&#13;
through its traffic police corps, promoting road safety and drivers' education, managing the&#13;
annual vehicle safety inspections, and operating old electro-mechanical traffic light systems. To&#13;
facilitate the handling of its investments (initially for road safety and drivers' education), in&#13;
1989, DATT was complemented by a decentralized revolving fund with legal personality,&#13;
called FONDATT. FONDATT receives the revenues of traffic fines, vehicle license fees, and a&#13;
share of the annual vehicle stamp tax.&#13;
3.    Responsibilities for road development and maintenance have remained with the&#13;
District's Urban Development Institute (IDU) and Public Works Secretariat (SOP)&#13;
respectively. The operation of electronic traffic signals was left with a division of the Bogota&#13;
Telephone Company (ETB). ETB has satisfactorily maintained the equipment but has&#13;
displayed little progress in optimizing the timing of the signals. In 1992, the District and ETB&#13;
agreed to transfer the responsibility for the operation of electronic traffic signals to DATT,&#13;
but with maintenance tasks retained by ETB. The Secretariat for Internal Affairs (Secretaria&#13;
de Gobierno) was placed in charge of off-street parking. Other sector agencies include a&#13;
mixed-capital company operating inter-city transport terminals, a shell Metro Company&#13;
(created in 1985 to operate a future metro), and a trolley-bus company (EDTU) which has&#13;
since been disbanded. Each of these agencies reported directly to the Mayor, and no specific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35                                Annex 2&#13;
mechanism was put in place to ensure the consistency of their development programs or to&#13;
order investment priorities within the sector.&#13;
4.    The above led to a critical lack of coordination in sector programs, characterized by&#13;
pervasive duplication of functions, turf conflicts, and waste or retention of the information&#13;
produced by each agency, contributing to increased inefficiency in the transport system. To&#13;
address these deficiencies, the District prepared in 1989, with Bank advice and the assistance of&#13;
UNDP consultants, and started to implement in 1990, a program of institutional reforms aimed&#13;
at strengthening sector agencies and improving their operation and coordination.&#13;
The 1991 Reorganization&#13;
5.    Agreement 11 of June 1990 authorized the Mayor to reorganize sector agencies. The&#13;
reorganization was legally enacted through Decrees 265-267 of May 1991. Key measures&#13;
were to:&#13;
(a)   transform DATT into a Secretariat for Traffic and Transport (STT), giving it a&#13;
higher rank in the District's organization and allowing it to receive affiliate&#13;
institutes or enterprises; and establish STT as the lead agency for transport;&#13;
(b)    make STT the sole line agency of the District for traffic management and&#13;
public transport by transferring to it functions and organizational units&#13;
previously scattered in several agencies, including (i) the operation of traffic&#13;
lights and automated traffic count devices (transferred from the telephone&#13;
company, together with the proceeds of a traffic light surtax on vehicle&#13;
licenses); and (ii) the responsibility to oversee off-street parking (from the&#13;
Intemal Affairs Secretariat). STT has also received as affiliates the Transport&#13;
Teminals company, the bus company (EDTU), and the Metro Company, the&#13;
last two have now been almost fully liquidated;&#13;
(c)    assign to STT broad responsibilities for planning and policy formulation in the&#13;
sector. Within STT a new Planning department (at the deputy secretary level)&#13;
is to discharge these responsibilities;&#13;
(d)    integrate the programs of SOP, IDU and STT, create a Transport Sector&#13;
Coordination Committee, with powers to vet all sector programs, policies, and&#13;
annual budgets. The Committee is chaired by the Mayor, or in his absence, by&#13;
the head of STT. Other members are the chiefs of the District Planning&#13;
Department, SOP, the Finance Secretariat and IDU. STT's deputy secretary&#13;
for planning is in charge of the permanent technical secretariat of the&#13;
Committee; and&#13;
(e)    extend the scope of activity of STT's investment fund FONDATT, enabling it&#13;
to finance the whole range of traffic engineering investments, contract studies&#13;
and technical assistance, and to retain pemmanent staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                 Annex 2&#13;
6.     STT's new organization chart included two departments (Subsecretarias). The sub-&#13;
secretariat for Traffic and Transport is responsible for line activities, which are handled through&#13;
four operational units: User Relations, Public Transport, Control (traffic police), and Busway&#13;
Operations. Its organization is a streamlined version of the former structure of DATT, and it&#13;
essentially has the same functions, plus the operation of traffic lights as mentioned above.&#13;
Decrees 265-267 clearly spell out the intemal organization, objectives and specific tasks of&#13;
each unit.&#13;
7.    The new sub-secretariat for Planning has the function of preparing sector plans, policies&#13;
and projects. It should collect and maintain information, provide professional support to the&#13;
operational departments, and operate FONDATT. FONDATT's director is the Secretary of&#13;
Transport, and its deputy director STT's deputy secretary for planning. Decree 267 gave to&#13;
FONDATT functions and internal units identical to those of STT's Planning sub-secretariat'.&#13;
This allows the sub-secretariat to carry out its mainstream programs through FONDATT,&#13;
which as a decentralized agency has nimbler procedures than the District's central&#13;
administration for budgeting and contracting, and may retain highly skilled personnel for which&#13;
STT's pay scale would be unattractive.&#13;
Operational Start-up and Performance of STT&#13;
8.    The reorganization was made legally effective in May 1991 and key positions have&#13;
been filled. Though STT has taken some initial steps in sector planning and coordination,&#13;
it has not been able to assume the role envisaged in the 1991 reorganization primarily&#13;
because of strong resistance from the other sector institutions to relinquish any power,&#13;
inadequate staffing in STT and the location of the Planning Secretariat low within the&#13;
organizational structure of the system so that it has little power to take actions&#13;
independently. Also, STT focuses more on day-to-day operational (and income&#13;
generating) activities and operates on a permanently crisis-driven basis. This has&#13;
prevented STT from achieving its envisaged role as head and coordinator of the transport&#13;
sector in Bogota.&#13;
Proposed reform of transport sector in the District.&#13;
9.     Since it came into office in January 1995, the present city administration has been&#13;
giving consideration to an institutional reform in order to address the aforementioned&#13;
coordination problems, and to lay the foundation for a new long-term institutional&#13;
framework for the transport sector in the Capital District so that the sector's long-term&#13;
challenges can be tackled more efficiently. The proposed reorganization would likely&#13;
entail the following: (i) the creation of a single transit authority for the Capital District; (ii)&#13;
the liquidation, or amalgamation into this new institution, of the current sector entities,&#13;
IDU, FOSOP and STT; and (iii) the review of all current functions and processes within&#13;
the current sector entities, in order to rationalize the functions of the new institution with a&#13;
strong propensity to contract-out specific tasks to the private sector.&#13;
'The Planning sub-secretanat/FONDATT includes four Units: Planning, Progmms, Investment Budgets and&#13;
Information&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37                                 Annex 2&#13;
10.   While the concept is still at an early stage, initial steps have been taken by the&#13;
District, including the appointment of a transport committee, composed of prominent&#13;
transport specialists, to (a) advise the administration on sector strategy; (b) propose&#13;
solutions to the transport and transit problems; and (c) assess the appropriateness of the&#13;
proposed Transit Authority. This committee has concluded that sector planning and&#13;
coordination needs great improvement and it endorses the integration of all sector&#13;
functions with private sector participation to the degree possible. The District&#13;
Administration has also included the proposed restructuring of sector entities as part of its&#13;
Development Plan. The detailed design of the new institution and the overall&#13;
transformation plan will now be studied in more detail by consultants. The District is&#13;
recruiting an independent outside high level consultant manager to coordinate and carry&#13;
out the reform, including the studies and subsequent activities.&#13;
11.   This reform has still to secure the City Council's approval, a step with an uncertain&#13;
outcome, as it might face political resistance because of its implications in sensitive areas,&#13;
such as the severance of personnel. A fall-back position might limit the reform to&#13;
strengthening the coordination and planning capabilities - but within the existing entities.&#13;
The Bank has agreed to assist with the institutional reform initiatives within the proposed&#13;
operation, including relevant studies and future strengthening of the new transport entity,&#13;
if, and when, it is approved. In the meantime, the existing institutions are capable of&#13;
implementing the urgent bus corridors, access roads, and street maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation investments which need to move ahead.&#13;
Strengthening Measures&#13;
12.   The following activities are included in the Project: (i) financing of computers,&#13;
software, equipment, and vehicles for FONDATT, STT's planning department and the&#13;
busways operations unit; (ii) training of the traffic police; (iii) training of transport&#13;
professionals; and (iv) transport planning and policies studies (Annex 3); These institutional&#13;
strengthening activities and the studies proposed under the project for STT, as well as&#13;
those proposed for IDU and SOP would make a valid contribution to the urban transport&#13;
sector development in Bogota, regardless of the outcome of above-mentioned reforms.&#13;

STUDIES, TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
1.    This Annex summarizes the scope of technical assistance and training in each&#13;
component. The District has designed the technical assistance program so as to maximize the&#13;
participation of District personnel and local consultants, in order to save costs and ensure that&#13;
intemal capacities are developed. Extemal specialists will provide guidance, quality control&#13;
and training in areas for which local experience is limited.&#13;
Studies by FONDATT. (Part A.2)&#13;
2.    FONDATT will carry out studies to help the District formulate policies for traffic and&#13;
parking management and public transport, define investment priorities, and prepare feasibility&#13;
studies for area traffic management plans. The District's Transport Sector Coordination&#13;
Committee will be the steering committee for each study and will review and approve its&#13;
recommendations.&#13;

39                                Annex 3&#13;
Non-motorized Transport Study.&#13;
Objectives: To define policy measures and a medium-term investment program to&#13;
facilitate non-motorized transport, particularly bicycle transport, and to improve safety for&#13;
users.&#13;
Scope: To provide key profile of bicycle use in Bogota, including recreational and&#13;
non-recreational, and to document the effect of existing impediments such as lack of&#13;
segregated facilities or adequate crossing, aggressive driver and cyclist behavior, etc. To&#13;
define strategic routes through the city, and for each, prepare a pre-feasibility study of&#13;
investments and administrative measures to which would be required to improve the&#13;
conditions of non-motorized transport, including needed safety measures. To define&#13;
supporting measures such as regulatory framework, training needs of police or&#13;
dissemination of information. To incorporate proposed actions into a 3-4 year program,&#13;
including costs and implementation specifics.&#13;
Resources: FONDATT staff will receive support (4-5 person-months) from a&#13;
traffic engineer/planner hired internationally with experience of bikeway schemes.&#13;
Timing: Study duration is estimated at 5 months, starting by April 1996 (Annex&#13;
6).&#13;
Public Transport System Study&#13;
Objectives: To review the existing system and prepare a comprehensive public&#13;
transport policy for Bogota, including bus fares, licensing system, supervision of the&#13;
services, incentives for new, higher quality and environmentally acceptable bus services,&#13;
training to address possible deficiencies in the existing structure of the route network, and&#13;
relationships with other modes including informal transport, walking and cycling.&#13;
Scope: (i) To review the existing system, including indicators of efficiency,&#13;
financial returns from bus operation, impacts of present regulations, and on-street impacts&#13;
of present bus operations etc, to identify problems and deficiencies; (ii) analyze the broad&#13;
patterns of route distribution on the street network, identify major deficiencies (such&#13;
excess concentrations of route or coverage gaps), and propose organizational&#13;
improvements, methods and procedures for STT to address such deficiencies as needed;&#13;
(iii) analyze relationships with other modes and propose improvements; (iv) develop a bus&#13;
policy covering fares, fleet renewal policies, regulatory framework and supervision&#13;
procedures; and (v) prepare implementation policy and action plan.&#13;
Resources: (additional to FONDATT inputs). Estimated at 6 person-months of&#13;
specialists hired internationally including bus operations specialist (3 months), transport&#13;
institutions and regulations expert (1 month) and financial analyst (2 months).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                Annex 3&#13;
Timing: Study duration estimated at 10 months, starting by August 1996 (Annex&#13;
6).&#13;
Parking Plan and Policy Study.&#13;
Objectives: To establish a policy and action plan to (i) improve parking&#13;
conditions in central Bogota, (ii) reduce interference of parking with traffic flows, and (iii)&#13;
introduce the use of restrictions and pricing of parking space as a tool for car traffic&#13;
demand management.&#13;
Scope: A pilot-zone study will be used to obtain empirical information typical of&#13;
central Bogota, test the policy approach proposed, and train STT/FONDATT personnel.&#13;
It will include (1) inventory of parking space, (2) identification of conflicts with traffic, (3)&#13;
survey of parking demand (including time patterns, turnover, purposes) and&#13;
demand/supply balance, (4) review of the potential impact of parking restrictions on local&#13;
businesses (interview survey), and (5) preparation of an area parking plan. Within the&#13;
pilot zone, the study will (a) define critical areas of the city in term of parking scarcity and&#13;
conflicts with traffic; (b) review existing policies and arrangements, including pricing,&#13;
physical restrictions, and enforcement; and (c) propose adjustments of the regulatory&#13;
framework (including authorization procedures to create off-street facilities, obligations&#13;
for developers to provide parking, taxation, short-stay only zones, etc.), enforcement&#13;
(including possible use of private towing contractors), and procedures to monitor parking&#13;
conditions and to implement area parking plans.&#13;
Resources: FONDATT staff will receive support (6 person-months) from a traffic&#13;
engineer/planner hired internationally, with experience in the design and implementation of&#13;
parking management schemes.&#13;
Timing: Study duration estimated at 7 months, starting by August 1996.&#13;
Study of Traffic Accident Reporting and Analysis System&#13;
Objectives: To improve traffic accident reporting and data analysis procedures in&#13;

Resources: (additional to FONDATT/STT inputs). Estimated at 4 person-&#13;
months of a traffic safety specialist hired internationally, and 6 person-months of local&#13;
consultants including an organization specialist and a data handling specialist.&#13;
Timing: Study duration estimated at 9 months, starting by March 1996.&#13;
Training of FONDATT Personnel (Part A.2)&#13;
FONDATT personnel will receive hands-on training by participating in the above&#13;
studies, and in-house lectures or seminars will be delivered by each of the experts contracted&#13;
for the studies. In addition, self-standing training activities will include (i) a limited number of&#13;
visits abroad for key technical personnel (5 person-months of per-diem abroad in 10 person-&#13;
trips), with each trip and CV of persons travelling to be cleared with the Bank; (ii) fees and&#13;
travel (16 person-weeks, including course preparation time, and 8 international trips) of top&#13;
international experts to deliver seminars to District personnel on topics including transport&#13;
economics, traffic models, optimization of signals, bus regulations, parking management, air&#13;
pollution, environmental assessment of urban transport projects, and organization of traffic&#13;
safety; and (iii) a program of scholarships for graduate transport courses in a local university.&#13;
Training of the Traffic Police. (Part A.2)&#13;
STT has placed a strong emphasis since 1988 on elevating the technical skills of the&#13;
traffic police and restoring its credibility with the public. Actions taken include improvement of&#13;
salaries, higher qualification requirements for new hires, and training. However, the training&#13;
has consisted of ad-hoc activities and has not been sufficiently planned. The project would&#13;
support the training effort of STT by financing consultant services (16 person-month) to (i)&#13;
prepare a medium-term training plan for the traffic police force; (ii) develop a curriculum for&#13;
core in-house training programs; (iii) train STT's trainers; and (iv) monitor and advise STT for&#13;
the execution of the training plan. Funds would be provided for the production of course&#13;
materials and purchase of training aids. The training plan would be prepared by mid 1996 and&#13;
executed over a three-year period. Inputs may be secured through a twinning arrangement&#13;
with a similar institution abroad, or from a specialized school. Course topics will include (i)&#13;
basic concepts of the need for traffic regulation, the functions of the traffic police and&#13;
relationships with citizens; (ii) traffic laws and transport regulations in Bogota; (iii) traffic&#13;
control problems and techniques; and (iv) procedures for accidents including on-site&#13;
intervention, investigation and reporting.&#13;
Technical Assistance to SOP. (Part C.2)&#13;
During appraisal it was found that in order for SOP to efficiently administer the road-&#13;
maintenance component it would require technical support.&#13;
Objectives: To help SOP (i) develop and fully assimilate as a permanent tool for&#13;
pavement management, the computerized inventory of street sections in line with the&#13;
system established during project preparation, and implement the organization and&#13;
&#13;

C with appropriate quality and cost effectiveness.&#13;
Scope: The technical assistance, composed of long-term local consultants and&#13;
experts hired internationally for shorter-term assignments, will be the nucleus of a&#13;
permanent pavement management unit in SOP. Tasks will include: (i) develop the&#13;
inventory of road sections established during project preparation into an on-going&#13;
pavement information system with appropriate data bases, files and archive of road design&#13;
documents, including procedures to keep it current and to use it for planning, budgeting&#13;
and monitoring SOP's mainstream programs of road maintenance and rehabilitation; (ii)&#13;
help SOP develop appropriate technical standards, guidelines and manuals for pavement&#13;
design and maintenance; (iii) advise SOP's management on organization, financial&#13;
management, performance monitoring, book-keeping, and better monitoring of its unit&#13;
costs per activity; (iv) lead the execution and quality control of the project's maintenance&#13;
component; and (v) provide on-the-job training to SOP's personnel.&#13;
Resources: The technical assistance will include long-term assignment of a team&#13;
from a local consulting engineer firm (for a total of 8 person-years) supported by shorter&#13;
assignments by an expert in maintenance systems (12 person-month) and a management&#13;
specialist (8 person-month) hired internationally.&#13;

COLOMBIA&#13;
BOGOTA URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
SUPERVISION PROGRAM&#13;
1.    A project coordinating and monitoring unit will be constituted within SHB to supervise&#13;
and facilitate implementation of each project component through each implementing agency&#13;
and compiling progress reports for submission to the Bank. The unit will consist of a project&#13;
coordinator, adequately supported by a financial analyst and engineer and administrative staff&#13;
with on-demand services from various sector specialists. The coordinator should have proven&#13;
administrative skills and some knowledge of procurement issues to facilitate the timely&#13;
execution of the project. Each implementing agency will produce progress reports which will&#13;
be submitted to the project coordinating unit, which, in turn, will compile and submit summary&#13;
reports to the Bank.&#13;
2.    The field supervision will consist of a local consultant stationed at the World Bank&#13;
Resident Mission in Bogota. The consultant will dedicate a total of about 12 staff weeks&#13;
annually to the project. The costs of this consultant will amount to a total of about US$15,000&#13;
per year.&#13;
3.    The in-house supervision will consist of 12 staff-weeks: 8 staff-weeks for the task-&#13;
manager and 4 staff-weeks for a highway engineer (who will be responsible for procurement&#13;
and technical assistance tasks and implementation of the road maintenance plan). In addition,&#13;
an average of 5 staff-weeks per year should be allocated to specialized consultants (e.g. a&#13;
traffic management specialist and an urban transport specialist) who will assist in specific&#13;
supervision tasks. The total cost of these consultants is estimated at US$18,000 per year,&#13;
including travel expenses.&#13;
4.    In sum, the supervision plan consists of 29 staff-weeks per year, including the 12 staff-&#13;
weeks of in-house supervision. The annual extemal costs amount to about US$33,000.&#13;
5.    Audits. The District and its executing agencies would each maintain records and&#13;
separate project accounts for the components under its responsibility, and would have&#13;
them audited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank. The&#13;
scope of the audits would include the adequacy of the accounting systems and internal&#13;
controls, the operations of the Special Account and the reliability of SOE's as a basis for&#13;
loan disbursements. In addition, independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank&#13;
would audit annual financial statements of the District with the aim of determining&#13;
whether the District is in compliance with the covenants of the loan. Audit reports would&#13;
be provided to the Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47                              Annex 5&#13;
6.    Reports. The District, through the Project Coordinator, would present to the&#13;
Bank annual project reports and brief progress updates every six months. The annual&#13;
reports, to be submitted to the Bank before May 31 each year starting in 1996 a month&#13;
before the annual review (see below), would (i) describe progress of procurement,&#13;
physical investments, technical assistance, and the overall pace of project implementation;&#13;
(ii) present actual values of agreed monitoring indicators (in both project implementation&#13;
and results), compare them with appraisal targets and discuss differences; (iii) propose&#13;
remedial actions in case of unsatisfactory progress; (iv) present projected investments and&#13;
financing needs including counterpart funding per entity for the year the report is prepared&#13;
and the following year; and (v) describe on-going developments in the sector relevant to&#13;
the project. The District would submit an implementation completion report (ICR) to the&#13;
Bank within six months after the closing date of the loan.&#13;
7.    Annual Reviews. On the basis of the progress and audit reports, the District and&#13;
the Bank would carry out each year by June 30 starting in 1996 a joint review of project&#13;
progress including pace and quality of execution, investment programming and budgeting,&#13;
counterpart funding, compliance with loan covenants, and sector developments with&#13;
relevance to the project. The review would be an opportunity to discuss and finalize the&#13;
annual programs and subprojects presented for Bank approval. In case of unsatisfactory&#13;
progress the reviews would lead to the formulation of adjustments and, if necessary,&#13;
remedial actions satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;

COLOMBIA&#13;
BOGOTA URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
1.    The annual project reports will present the actual values of the following indicators,&#13;
compare them with appraisal estimates, and discuss and formulate an appropriate response&#13;
regarding any substantial differences found in this comparison.&#13;
2.    The attached implementation chart presents details on the expected rate of progress in&#13;
project implementation. As it indicates, most of the studies and design works would be&#13;
finalized in 1996 with implementation commencing shortly thereafter.&#13;
3.    Corridors. The performance of bus corfidors will be assessed by monitoring speed,&#13;
the number of public transport buses in service at rush hour, and the accident rate. Average&#13;
rush-hour speed in Calle 80 busway is at present 13kph. On completion of the proposed&#13;
investments, the speeds is projected to increase to 18 kph for buses and 22 kph for cars in Calle&#13;
80. Currently, the number of buses in peak hour is 520 in Calle 80; on completion of the&#13;
proposed investments, the number of public transport vehicles will be controlled at under 450&#13;
in Calle 80 (to facilitate smoother flow). With respect to the number of accidents that occured&#13;
in Calle 80, in 1994, this figure is expected to decrease by 20%/o in the second year after the&#13;
proposed investments have been implemented and by 40% in the third year of operation.&#13;
4.    Access Roads. Progress and beneficiary population targets are as follows:&#13;

COLOMBIA&#13;
BOGOTA URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL IMPACT&#13;
Scope and Conclusions&#13;
I.    This annex analyses the past financial performance of the local government of&#13;
Bogota, and presents projections which assess the District's future financial position and&#13;
potential contribution to the self financing of its development needs. It also assesses the&#13;
impact of the proposed Project and Loan on the District's finances, and verifies the ability&#13;
of the District to provide timely counterpart funding for project investments and to service&#13;
debt including the proposed Loan.&#13;
2.    They are based on projections prepared by the District's Finance Secretariat&#13;
(SHB). However, SHB's assumptions on the future growth of revenues and investments&#13;
have been revised downwards. Data for 1981-93 are historical, based on budget&#13;
execution reports audited by the District comptroller. Data for 1994 are based on&#13;
unaudited budget execution and data for 1995 are based on the approved budget for the&#13;
year.&#13;
3.    Annual Project investments are expected to reach a maximum of about US$ 52&#13;
million in year 1997, which is less than one-fourth of the District's investment volume&#13;
during 1994 and about 6% of the projected investment for 1997. The projection shows&#13;
that if the District adheres to a policy of active resource mobilization and controls the&#13;
growth of its current expenditures, it will be able to provide timely counterpart funding for&#13;
project investments and debt service. A sensitivity analysis performed to assess the&#13;
potential impact of variations in the expected performance of main fiscal revenues and&#13;
expenditures shows that the District's financial position would remain sound in the event&#13;
of a 20% decrease in expected future revenues and a similar increment in projected&#13;
expenditures for the period 1996-2000. In such an event the District, however would have&#13;
to sharply reduce its pace of investment.&#13;
The District's past performance&#13;
4.    The financial statement of Table I shows consolidated finances of the District. It&#13;
comprises funds which operate within its financial realm including FOSOP, FONDATT,&#13;
and IDU. It also includes the gasoline surtax. However, it excludes other proposed&#13;
incremental sources of income which such as betterment levies, National Grants or new&#13;
debt because no firm figures are yet available .&#13;
5.    In the 1980s, the District achieved a level of fiscal self-reliance matched in few&#13;
Colombian municipalities. Revenues grew in real terms by 5% per year to a level of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                               Annex 8&#13;
US$217 million equivalent by 1989. After current expenditures of US$131 million and&#13;
debt service of US$58 million, the District generated net internal funds of US$28 million&#13;
in 1989. Investments at US$86 million were up 225% in real terms from 1985.&#13;
6.    The District's financial performance deteriorated in 1990, an election year, and&#13;
further in 1991, years in which revenues, though not expenditures, failed to keep pace&#13;
with inflation. Based on statements audited by the District's comptroller, current savings&#13;
fell 30% in 1990 to US$60 million equivalent. In 1991, the net generation of funds after&#13;
debt service fell to US$0.5 million. Only 7% of that year's investments were financed&#13;
from equity. This resulted in a substantial increase of borrowings, mostly with maturities&#13;
of less than three years, and a financing gap of US$25 million by the end of 1991 which&#13;
was heavy on short-term debt.&#13;
7.    In July 1992, with the advent of a new administration, the District started to&#13;
improve its finances through better financial management and an adjustment program that&#13;
emphasized the reduction of current expenditures. In spite of its efforts, reflected in the&#13;
reduction of staff at various decentralized agencies and a substantial increase in the&#13;
registration and collection of property taxes, the 1992 statement did not show a decrease&#13;
in financing gap. During 1993 the overall situation remained the same, except for the&#13;
billing of betterment levies, which collected US$ 35 million and permitted the doubling of&#13;
investment amounts to US$ 156 million as compared with 1992 figures.&#13;
8.    Based on the decentralization policies embodied in the 1991 constitution, transfers&#13;
from the National Government to municipalities were reviewed and increased in 1993 by&#13;
Law 60. Transfers now include: (i) fiscal allocations for health and education, and (ii)&#13;
municipal transfers, mainly from nationally collected sales tax. However, increased&#13;
resources from fiscal allocations, were matched with a commensurate devolution of&#13;
spending responsibility (for education and health). Municipal transfers have been&#13;
redefined and will gradually increase by 1996 to 24.5% of the Nation's Current Revenues.&#13;
This will result in growth of the District's revenues from around US$ 81 million in 1994 to&#13;
an expected US$ 405 million in 1996.&#13;
9.    In July 1993, the National Government issued a Decree (1421) establishing a&#13;
special regime for the city "Estatuto Organico del Distrito Capitat'. This Decree&#13;
rearranged the responsibilities within the District, providing greater executive control to&#13;
the Mayor and his administration. This statute also allowed the District to use a wider&#13;
range of revenue raising instruments such as gasoline surcharges, road tolls, and&#13;
betterment levies.&#13;
10.   In 1994, based on this Statute, the District administration introduced a fiscal&#13;
reform which entailed new instruments such as a self-valuation system for the property tax&#13;
and a bi-monthly billing for the commerce and industry tax. Collection of these taxes was&#13;
also significantly strengthened by the adoption of a stringent fiscal regime similar to the&#13;
more advanced and enforced National Tributary Regime. In the case of the property tax,&#13;
under the new self-valuation procedure, 100,000 previously unregistered properties were&#13;
&#13;

57                                Annex 8&#13;
declared by the owners. This, together with an increase in the declared base-cost of&#13;
properties, resulted in revenues for 1994 close to twice those of 1993. On the expenses&#13;
side, in 1994, the solid waste utility was disbanded and the service was entirely entrusted&#13;
to the private sector. The combination of the above led to an increase in revenue and&#13;
boosted net current savings2 to US$ 200.0 million in 1994. This positive trend appears to&#13;
be consolidating as indicated by preliminary results up to mid 1995. A 13% surtax on&#13;
gasoline, which would be primarily used for street maintenance has been approved by the&#13;
District Council. This will rise by 1% annually to 15% in 1997. In sum, with the new&#13;
Statute, the District administration has acquired the legal basis for confronting the&#13;
deterioration of its financial performance and the backlog in the rehabilitation of the city's&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
The District's Financial Perspectives&#13;
11.   Encouraged by the aforementioned results, and based on medium term financial&#13;
projections, the District has recently approved an ambitious US$ 6.0 billion investment&#13;
plan for the 1995-2000 period. The District is financially responsible for about US$ 4.0&#13;
billion of this investment plan, and the rest lies within the responsibility of its decentralized&#13;
water, telecommunications, and power utilities. The financial sources for the plan indicate&#13;
that the District would finance about 60% from its current savings, an amount which is&#13;
consistent with the attached financial scenario, and the rest would come from the&#13;
combination of extra efforts, including new betterment levies, grants from the National&#13;
Government, increased internal debt and further increase in fiscal revenues. These&#13;
measures, though already defined and generally assessed as viable, still need refinement&#13;
and detailed design, and will require significant efforts to implement. For this reason they&#13;
were not considered in the base scenario shown.&#13;
12.   The attached projections are based on more conservative assumptions than those&#13;
considered by the District's financial planners. These projections present a baseline and&#13;
are primarily founded on traditional revenues and expenses, and as mentioned earlier, they&#13;
exclude proposed new revenues except for a 13% gasoline tax surcharge. The property&#13;
tax and other revenues are expected to increase in line with inflation and with the regional&#13;
GDP of Bogota which is projected to grow 1% per year in real terms. Expenditures are&#13;
projected to grow in line with inflation, reflecting the District's policy to freeze its overall&#13;
staffing level. Debt service includes (a) that of the proposed Bank Loan; (b) existing&#13;
commitments (including an IDB Loan for the Ciudad Bolivar slum upgrading project, fully&#13;
committed); and (c) future domestic borrowings, expected to be at 5-year maturities&#13;
without grace period and with an average interest rate of inflation plus ten percentage&#13;
points.&#13;
13.   For the period 1995-2000, the financial projection show that if present tendencies&#13;
in revenues and expenditures are maintained, the District will be able to significantly&#13;
increase its savings and will be able to carry out the proposed Project, service its debts and&#13;
2 Difference between current revenues, and current expenditures plus debt service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                               Annex 8&#13;
still make unprecedented contributions to investments. Current ratio by the end of the&#13;
century would be less than 0.3, an enviable condition matched in few cities. The&#13;
consolidation of this trend seems achievable, but depends mainly on the control of current&#13;
expenditures and, to some extent, on the upgrading of the District's financial management&#13;
which needs urgent modemization and improvement. To address this, the proposed&#13;
project includes a set of studies and technical assistance activities for the SHB.&#13;
14.   A sensitivity analysis was made to assess the impact of foreign exchange risk and&#13;
rates, and of variations in revenues from the main taxes and current expenditures on the&#13;
District's financial position. In regard to foreign exchange and interest risks, results&#13;
indicate that impact on the District's financial position would not be significant even in the&#13;
event of an unlikely 50% increase in both loan rates and foreign exchange. This result is in&#13;
line with the modest amount of the Loan, as compared with the total investment&#13;
prospects. On the other hand the District's financial position is quite sensitive to&#13;
variations in revenues from main taxes and expenditures. The analysis shows that in the&#13;
event of a combined 20% less revenues and 20% increase in expenditures sustained over&#13;
the period 1996 - 2000 vis-a-vis the base scenario, the District's financial position would&#13;
still remain sound but investments would be sharply reduced, and limited to earmarked&#13;
revenues and to this proposed transport project.&#13;
LDU, FONDATT and FOSOP&#13;
15.   In its beginnings in the early 1970s, [DU was envisaged as a financially self-&#13;
sustainable entity with revenues depending on the effective and timely collection of&#13;
betterment levies. IDU in the 1970s and early 1980s used to obtain 85% of its total&#13;
resources from betterment levies, and therefore has always received transfers from the&#13;
city's central government. This situation was aggravated during the period 1986-1990&#13;
when the Bogota city council did not approve charges on any major investment. After&#13;
Statute 1421 for the District was approved, and betterment levies were again permitted,&#13;
IDU finally issued a US$ 100.0 million billing in August 1993 by means of a procedure&#13;
called "general benefit" which includes charges spread across large areas of the city.&#13;
Recent revenues, all pertaining to the aforementioned billing, have been limited, adding to&#13;
not more than US$ 50.0 million, or half of the expected amount.&#13;
16.   In its recent development plan, the District has reaffirmed its commitment to&#13;
continue revitalizing the use of betterment levies as an important instrument for&#13;
sustainable road development in Bogota. IDU is therefore expected to continue with its&#13;
role of constructing large works and recovering costs through betterment levies, this time&#13;
through only billing local beneficiaries. However, it would not be realistic to expect that&#13;
all road development costs will be recovered from betterment levies. Transfers from the&#13;
District treasury will continue to be required.&#13;
17.   The revenue scenario shown in Table 1, however errs on the safe side by excluding&#13;
new revenues from betterment levies as the actual plan has not been defined. If the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59                                Annex 8&#13;
assumptions in the development plan on the evolution of betterment levies do not&#13;
materialize, road investment in the District will be constrained.&#13;
18.   FONDATT, the Traffic Safety Fund which handles the investment resources of the&#13;
District's Secretariat for Traffic and Transport (STT) was established in 1989 and its&#13;
functions and scope of activities substantially changed by Decrees in May 199 1.&#13;
FONDATT generates revenues from charges such as fines and user charges such as&#13;
license plates, vehicle inspections, etc. FONDATT's finances have been consolidated with&#13;
those of the District in Table 1.&#13;
19.   SOP, the Public Works Secretariat, will execute the investments in component C&#13;
of the project. Its road maintenance activities are not revenue-generating, and it will&#13;
operate mostly from funds transferred from the District. The District plans to dedicate&#13;
most of the gasoline surcharge to road maintenance projects. SOP's expenditures are&#13;
merged with those of the District's central administration for the purposes of this analysis.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Scope&#13;
1.    A cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate the economic impact of the&#13;
proposed project. This annex describes the set of costs and benefits that have been&#13;
considered in the economic analysis and the assumptions adopted regarding key inputs.&#13;
The costs and benefits of the proposed transport improvements are compared using the&#13;
"with" and "without" project scenario. The financial prices were converted into economic&#13;
prices by adjusting them for the impact of taxes and subsidies. In addition, the standard&#13;
conversion factor and the shadow price for unskilled labor were calculated3.&#13;
2.    The proposed project consists of four major components. The first component is&#13;
the traffic management and transport corridor program (57 percent of project costs). This&#13;
consists of an integrated program of least-cost investments, which, supported by&#13;
administrative measures, aims to improve transport flows (including public transport and&#13;
car traffic) in a major transit corridor and its area of influence. The access roads program&#13;
(representing 10 percent of project costs) seeks to improve public transport access to low-&#13;
income areas. The third component is the road maintenance program (27 percent of&#13;
project costs), to repair and/or rebuild arterials and secondary roads. The fourth&#13;
component comprises institutional support and technical assistance to improve the&#13;
capacity to manage urban transport in the Bogota Metropolitan Area (6 percent of project&#13;
costs). This TA component has not be included in the economic analysis due to problems&#13;
in estimating the benefits attributable to such investments.&#13;
3.    The three major project components have been evaluated separately as they differ&#13;
substantially in their objectives. Moreover, as discussed below, adding the different project&#13;
components together would result in a significant loss of information about the feasibility&#13;
of the sub-projects. The major benefits of the project will be operating-cost and travel-&#13;
time savings for car traffic and public transport (i.e., buses and mini-buses) for the corridor&#13;
program. The access roads program to low-income areas only measures the benefits of&#13;
operating-cost and travel-time savings for public transport. Research in 1990 by IDU&#13;
suggested that car ownership in these areas is not a significant factor. The road&#13;
maintenance program measures the benefits of operating-cost and travel-time savings for&#13;
car traffic, public transport, and road transport. The conventional cost-benefit analysis for&#13;
the three project component represents 86 percent of the total proposed investments.&#13;
3 The standard conversion factor was calculated at 0.95 on the basis of export and import data of the past&#13;
five years. The shadow price of unskilled labor was estimated at 0.95 (see: Poverty in Columbia,&#13;
World Bank).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Methodology&#13;
4.    A discount rate of 10 percent has been used to calculate the net present value of&#13;
the project. To reflect real costs and benefits, financial prices have been converted into&#13;
economic prices. The major differences between financial and economic prices involve the&#13;
impact of taxes and subsidies, and the use of shadow prices. Physical contingencies have&#13;
been included in the investment cost but price contingencies have been excluded as it has&#13;
been assumed that the prices of goods and services that will be acquired under the project&#13;
will increase in line with general inflation levels.&#13;
5.    The economic justification of the project is based on the benefits it would generate&#13;
in the form of time savings and vehicle operating cost savings. Travel time savings will&#13;
mainly result from reduced street congestion, new access roads to employment centers,&#13;
and road maintenance. Travel time savings will result from higher operating speeds which&#13;
will be translated into a reduction of the time required to make the trips. Vehicle operating&#13;
cost savings derive mainly from improved traffic speeds.&#13;
6.    In general, transport projects can hardly be economically justified without&#13;
accounting for time savings associated with improvements in transport management. The&#13;
monetary value of time is a key input in the economic analysis. The value of time is&#13;
considered a function of the wage level. In this analysis, the value of time is derived from&#13;
the income distribution of transport users, disaggregated by mode of transport and from&#13;
information on wage levels. The information on wage levels and subsequent mode of&#13;
transport was based on a survey carried out in 1990 by IDU which has subsequently been&#13;
adjusted to reflect present circumstances.&#13;
7.    The monthly wage is currently set at US$ 140. However, since a recent Bank&#13;
study showed the shadow price of the minimum wage is slightly lower at 0.95, in the&#13;
calculation of the time savings the shadow price of the minimum wage has been used.&#13;
Fringe benefits make up a substantial part of the minimum wage. They include vacation&#13;
and a thirteenth month of salary; they entail scaling the base minimum wage by a factor of&#13;
1.26 for unskilled workers and 1.23 for skilled workers. Hourly wages for each transport&#13;
mode are estimated by multiplying the individual minimum wage by the value of the&#13;
average minimum wage of each mode of transport and dividing the result by 157, which is&#13;
the assumed average number of hours worked in a given month. It is common practice in&#13;
urban transport projects to use only a proportion of the hourly wage rate to approximate&#13;
the value of time savings. Economic research indicates that trips should be valued as a&#13;
proportion of the net wage. Empirical evidence suggests that this proportion may vary&#13;
between 20 and 100 percent. In this economic analysis, a value of 30 percent has been&#13;
adopted. In the sensitivity analysis, the proportion of the hourly wage rate was varied to&#13;
assess its impact on the project's feasibility.&#13;
8.    Travel time savings are measured for each mode of transportation as the difference&#13;
between the total number of peak passenger-hours spent without the project and those&#13;
spent with the project. These peak hour estimates are converted to annual values and then&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64                               Annex 9&#13;
multiplied by the assumed value of time to obtain the monetary value of time savings. The&#13;
net change in travel time across the different transport modes is considered to be the&#13;
overall measure of travel time savings. These time savings do not include any benefits&#13;
related to generated demand. It is possible that reduced street congestion will induce&#13;
additional trips in the areas affected by the project investments. The exclusion of the&#13;
impact of generated demand will result in a conservative estimate of the total time savings&#13;
and hence results in underestimation of project benefits.&#13;
9.    The vehicle operating cost savings result from improved traffic speeds due to a&#13;
reduction of street congestion. Vehicle operating cost savings are measured for each mode&#13;
of transportation as the difference between the number of passenger-kilometers without&#13;
the project and that with the project. These estimates are subsequently being multiplied by&#13;
the assumed values of operating costs per passenger-kilometer. These vehicle operating&#13;
costs are expected to be a function of traffic speed, road conditions and type of pavement.&#13;
In the corridor program, the key variable in vehicle operating costs is traffic speed. In the&#13;
road maintenance program, vehicle operating costs are a function of changes in traffic&#13;
speed and road conditions, whereas for the access roads program traffic speed, road&#13;
conditions and type of pavement will influence the level of vehicle operating costs.&#13;
10.   The project will also produce a number of non-quantifiable benefits. The&#13;
unavailability of reliable data and difficulties of quantifying these preclude an estimation of&#13;
these benefits. They include road maintenance savings, and a reduction of externalities,&#13;
including a decrease in the incidence of traffic accidents and a reduction of air pollution.&#13;
The institutional strengthening component of the project would generate long-run&#13;
institutional benefits, because the capacity of the municipal administration, and the&#13;
environmental agency DAMA to manage urban transport will increase. Land values in the&#13;
affected areas may increase due to transport improvements.&#13;
Cost-Benefit Analysis for Corridor Program&#13;
11.   The corridor program consists of four sub-projects: institutional strengthening of&#13;
STT/FONDATT, and investment works in the Calle 80 and Avenida Caracas. The latter&#13;
comprises mainly of complementary traffic management measures to improve the recently-&#13;
constructed busway in the Avenida Caracas. Because of the difficulties in estimating the&#13;
anticipated benefits, this project sub-component has been excluded from the economic&#13;
analysis. Hence, 85 percent of the total investments of the corridor program has been&#13;
evaluated. In the "without project" situation, the proposed investments will not take place,&#13;
resulting in increasing street congestion resulting in very low traffic speeds.&#13;
12.   The evaluation of the economic viability of the corridor program includes the&#13;
benefits from vehicle operating cost and travel time savings for car traffic and public&#13;
transport. Travel time savings make up 77 percent of the benefits of the project. Savings in&#13;
vehicle operating costs make up the remaining 23 percent. The benefits of the project are&#13;
more or less equally divided between those related to car traffic (48 percent of the project&#13;
benefits) and public transport (52 percent of the project benefits).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65                               Annex 9&#13;
13.   The investment costs of this program are estimated at US$ 52.7 million in financial&#13;
prices (including physical contingencies). The incremental operation and maintenance cost&#13;
of the project consist of a traffic control system. The net present value (at r=12%) of the&#13;
project is US$ 41 million, the internal economic rate of return is 21 percent and the&#13;
benefit-cost ratio is 2.11.&#13;
14.   In the sensitivity analysis, the impact of a number of variables has been tested.&#13;
These comprise the impact of cost overruns, project delays, vehicle operating cost savings,&#13;
and value of time. Table 9.1 shows that the economic viability of the corridor project is&#13;
rather robust.&#13;

Cost-Benefit Analysis of Access Roads Program&#13;
15. The access roads program consists of investments to pave and upgrade 15 access&#13;
roads to improve transport access to and from low-income areas. These investments are&#13;
supplemented by a program to support IDU to strengthen its project-execution capabilities&#13;
and financial-planning capacity. The investment costs of this program are estimated at&#13;
US$ 11.3 million in financial prices (including physical contingencies, but excluding import&#13;
duties and taxes), of which US$ 10.8 million will be used for the construction of access&#13;
roads. In this analysis 15 access roads for which data were available and representing&#13;
about 80 percent of this project component have been evaluated. It is assumed that the&#13;
remaining 20 percent will be similar to the 15 access roads already evaluated. The&#13;
remaining investment funds will be used for increasing the institutional capacity of IDU.&#13;
The net present value of the project is US$ 1 million, the internal economic rate of return&#13;
is 12 percent and the benefit-cost ratio is 1.13.&#13;
16.   The economic evaluation of the access roads program includes the benefits from&#13;
vehicle operating cost and travel time savings of public transport only. These access roads&#13;
will be constructed in low-income areas, where car traffic is negligible. Travel time savings&#13;
make up 86 percent of the benefits, while savings in bus operating costs contribute 14&#13;
percent.&#13;
17.   The evaluation of the separate access roads shows large variances in the economic&#13;
feasibility of these roads. Some of them are not economically feasible as net benefits are&#13;
negative at a discount rate of 10 percent. This lack of feasibility seems to be mainly due to&#13;
diseconomies of scale, the very conservative transport demand estimates, and the&#13;
exclusion of some major benefits in the analysis.&#13;
18.   However, the access roads program has a very important poverty impact, as it&#13;
connects low-income areas to employment centers. At present, commuting from and to&#13;
low-income areas takes a lot of time. In the low-income settlements in the hilly southern&#13;
outskirts many residents currently spend more than four hours a day commuting to jobs,&#13;
businesses and other destinations. The access roads program would provide low-income&#13;
residents with easier access to the employment opportunities of the city. The benefits&#13;
associated with increased job opportunities have not been included in the benefit flows due&#13;
to the unavailability of reliable data. The analysis has not assessed the benefits arising from&#13;
increased land and property values in the low-income areas.&#13;
19.   In the sensitivity analysis, the impact of a number of variables has been tested.&#13;
Table 9.2 shows the estimated impact of cost overruns, project delays, vehicle operating&#13;
cost savings, and changes in value of time. The sensitivity analysis shows the importance&#13;
of time savings. A substantial reduction of the time savings will have a negative impact on&#13;
the project's viability. Significant cost overruns will have a similar impact.&#13;

Cost-Benefit Analysis for Road Maintenance Program&#13;
20.   The road maintenance program consists of investments to repair or rebuild about&#13;
395 lane-km of arterials and secondary roads used by car traffic, public transport and road&#13;
transport. These infrastructure invesLments are supplemented by an institutional&#13;
strengthening program to support SOP. This institutional strengthening program includes&#13;
the development and implementation of a pavement information system and the&#13;
development of standards and manuals for pavement design and maintenance. The&#13;
investment costs of this program are estimated at US$ 29.8 million in financial prices&#13;
(including physical contingencies, but excluding import duties and taxes), of which US$&#13;
28.9 million will be used for the repair and rebuilding of roads. The remaining investment&#13;
funds will be used for increasing the institutional capacity of SOP. The net present value of&#13;
the project is US$ 1,403 million, the internal economic rate of return is far above 50&#13;
percent and the benefit-cost ratio is 42.37; indicating that the project is extremely viable.&#13;
Because of the high IERR of the project, no sensitivity analysis has been carried out.&#13;
21. The econornic evaluation of the road maintenance program includes the benefits from&#13;
vehicle operating cost and travel time savings of car traffic and public transport, while it&#13;
also includes the vehicle operating cost savings for road transport. Travel time savings&#13;
make up 43 percent of the benefits, while savings in vehicle operating costs make up the&#13;
remaining 57 percent. About 70 percent of the benefits of this project component are&#13;
related to car traffic, another 27 percent is related to public transport and only 3 percent is&#13;
&#13;

exclusion of travel time savings of road transport.&#13;

            Colombia - Bogota Urban Transport Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Bogota Urban Transport Project will
            help finance priority investments in support of the
            transport strategy and institutional reforms adopted by the
            District. Its objectives are to: 1) improve major transport
            corridors by rationalizing vehicle flows and upgrading
            environmental conditions for users; 2) promote the use of
            public transport and of non-motorized transport modes; 3)
            facilitate public transport access to areas with low-income
            population; 4) extend the life of the road infrastructure;
            and 5) strengthen the District's institutions in charge
            of planning, managing and maintaining the transport
            infrastructure. The project will support selected
            infrastructure investments. It will include the following
            components: 1) traffic management and transport corridors;
            2) access roads for low-income settlements; 3) road
            maintenance; and 4) institutional support measures. The
            project components will also include equipment, consulting
            services, training, technical assistance, infrastructure
            investments, civil works, designs, planning, management and
            quality control.
