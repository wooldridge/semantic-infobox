&amp;#12;Part 2: How does Growth Pathways work?&#13;
Overview of diagnostic exercises&#13;
The Growth Pathways methodology includes three diagnostic exercises. Each addresses a different type of client ques-&#13;
tion and uses a different set of techniques and tools. However, all three diagnostics are organized around the Matrix model of a&#13;
cityâ&#128;&#153;s economy and together make up a holistic approach to city competitiveness. (Figure 3)&#13;

Provides an overview of the city economy focusing on changes in key economic indicators, benchmarks of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance and&#13;
enabling conditions, and an analysis of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic structure.&#13;
Why do it: The snapshot answers the question from city leaders, â&#128;&#156;How is my city doing?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
What it delivers: An overview of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s economic performance, plus two types of hypotheses: (i) constraints on city compet-&#13;
itiveness and (ii) sections of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s businesses (defined by sector, size or type of ownership) that offer growth potential or are&#13;
underperforming and thus deserve special attention.&#13;

Deep Dives&#13;
Focuses on selected industrial sectors or firm size bands and ownership types to identify their competitive potential and to identify key con-&#13;
straints.&#13;
Why do it: Our approach to city competitiveness starts from firm-level needs. Needs of firms differ across industries, firm sizes&#13;
and ownership types. Thus the most efficient interventions are sometimes those that identify and target the needs of specific busi-&#13;
ness with growth potential.&#13;
What it delivers: A focus on issues that need to be addressed to support specific types of businesses in the city.&#13;
Deep-dive diagnostics combines two analytical techniques:&#13;
1.	       In-depth prioritization â&#128;&#147; a detailed analysis of industry potential using market-research techniques.&#13;
2.	       Driving conditions benchmarking â&#128;&#147; a study of conditions that define growth in specific industries.&#13;
