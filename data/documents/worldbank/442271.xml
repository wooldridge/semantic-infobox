TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECTION A:&#13;
BACKGROUND AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
The New Integrated Pension System'&#13;
i.     Argentina reformed its national pension system in mid- 19942, when it substituted the&#13;
old pay-as-you-go system by a new mixed public/private two-pillar structure. The old system&#13;
suffered from a very high dependency ratio that was, in tum, caused by widespread evasion,&#13;
low retirement ages, and lax disability rules. Other problems were the promise of very high&#13;
indexed pensions relative to wages and the prevalence of special regimes that allowed for early&#13;
retirement and encouraged evasion. This system required an unsustainable contribution rate of&#13;
50 percent. Unable to impose such a high rate, the Government rieduced it to 21 percent and&#13;
reduced the replacement rate to half its target level, paying pensions with notes. Despite these&#13;
measures, the system ran deficits during the 1980s.&#13;
2.     The erosion of the real value of pensions prompted a barrage of lawsuits by&#13;
pensioners. In 1991, the Government recognized the past debt to pensioners and offered cash&#13;
payments with a limit of 1,580 pesos or payments with new bonds (dollars or pesos) with a&#13;
maturity of ten years. The total recognized debt amounted to 7. 5 billion pesos or 3.5 percent&#13;
of GDP.&#13;
3.     In 1994, the Government introduced a new integrated pension system. This system,&#13;
compulsory for all workers including the self-employed, has the f'ollowing structure:&#13;
(a)   The First Pillar is all public, financed by employers' contributions, earmarked&#13;
taxes and budgetary allocations. The employers' contributions are legally stipulated at&#13;
16 percent of wages, but discounts given to some sectors, and regions Ihave reduced the&#13;
average contribution to an estimated 14.7 percent.&#13;
From the Provincial Pension Reforn Adjustment Loan. August 19. 1996. (Report No. P-6967-AR)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
(b)    This pillar is responsible for three types of benefits:&#13;
(i)     a basic universal pension (PBU) equal to 27.5 percent of the average&#13;
covered wage, subject to a minimum eligibility period of 30 years and a normal&#13;
retirement age of 65 for men and 60 for women;&#13;
(ii)    a transitory compensatory pension (PC) for past contributions to the old&#13;
system, paying a pension equal to 1.5 percent of the average indexed salary of&#13;
the last 10 years of employment for every year of contribution to the old&#13;
system; and&#13;
(iii)    a pension paid to existing pensioners, also transitory.&#13;
(c)    The Second Pillar is financed by an 11 percent contribution rate by employees,&#13;
who have the option to invest it in a private pension fumd or in the national system:&#13;
(i)    the private option is a defined contribution system based on individual&#13;
capitalization accounts managed by pension funds administrators&#13;
(Admninistradoras de Fondos de Jubilaciones y Pensiones- AFJPs). The old-age&#13;
pension from this system will be in the form of 2L life annuity or scheduled&#13;
withdrawals based on the accumulated balance of each account, and will be&#13;
covered by group disability and life insurance. As of end 1995, about 5 million&#13;
workers had chosen to join one of the AFJPs, representing 55 percent of all&#13;
eligible workers and over 60 percent of affiliated workers.&#13;
(ii)    the public option is a defined-benefit' scheme. It provides a public&#13;
pension (PAP) of 0.85 percent of the average indexed monthly salary of the last&#13;
10 years of employment for every year of service to the new system, and will&#13;
also cover disability and survivorship benefits, s:imilar to those offered by the&#13;
private component.&#13;
4.       This pension system is based on one of the highest labor taxes in the world;&#13;
approximately 38% of gross salaries, compared to around 20% for the US, New Zealand and&#13;
Chile. It will require further reform to make it sustainable. For example, Government is&#13;
considering adjusting the sizes of the pillars relative to one another, and lowering the flat&#13;
pension to convert it into a safety net.&#13;
5.       Collections are carried out by the General Tax Directorate (DGI), which is undergoing&#13;
restructuring under its new General Director. Evasion is high; only 58.8 percent of potential&#13;
contributors actually pay, which the government estimates causes a deficit of some US$450&#13;
million per month.&#13;
3       Defined benefit: Specifies the amount of benefit due if participants mcet the eligibility criteria, such as age, years of work. minimum of&#13;
years under program coverage. 'The most common provide a pension based on a percentage of pre-retirement earnings. The benetits are&#13;
guaranteed, usually by govermient. and paid by a combination of current contributions ('pay.as..you-go"), accrued reserves or both. These&#13;
benefits permit transfen of income between groups (income or age). Defined contributions: Benefits depend on the contributions made, which are&#13;
inverted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
6.     Payments are administered by the National Social Security Administration (ANSeS),&#13;
which issues approximately 3.5 million payment orders per month. This will represent, for&#13;
1996, about US$15.3 billion. Inadequate granting and payment processes create a potential for&#13;
considerable distortions due to fraud and simple errors. Initial estimates by the government put&#13;
the amount of overpayment at a minimum of US$300 million per year; less conservative&#13;
estimates put the figure nearer to US$1 billion per year (the pension files are so inaccurate that&#13;
it is difficult to come up with a more precise estimate without an extensive corrective effort).&#13;
An improved administration of the public pension system is clearly indicated.&#13;
Pension Administration&#13;
7.     ANSeS is responsible for the administration of the public; component of the new&#13;
integrated pension system, covering old age, disability, widow an,d orphan funds, as well as&#13;
other social security schemes such as Farmily Allowances, the Naltional Employment Fund&#13;
(includes financing of retraining), and the administration of third party benefits such as military&#13;
and police pensions. In addition, it manages the resources of the Health Service Administration&#13;
(ANSSAL) and the National Social Security Institute for Retirees and Pensioners (INSSJP). In&#13;
all, ANSeS administers approximately 45% of the National Budget.&#13;
O.     ANSeS' operational budget is US$644 million per year. Of this, 48% represents&#13;
payments to the General Tax Directorate (DGI) and to some 80 lbanks (who handle payments).&#13;
ANSeS provides services to its clients through approximately 8,800 employees in 146 agencies&#13;
nationwide.&#13;
Status of the Pension Files&#13;
9.     In July 1995, letters were sent to 2.9 million pensioners asking for confirmation in&#13;
person of their right to receive a pension. The results were as follows:&#13;
* About 270,000 were represented by third parties. Of these, 30% were found to&#13;
have errors and irregularities.&#13;
*  About 188,000 did not come, nor did they send representatives. About 15% are&#13;
estimated to be fraudulent.&#13;
* About 316,000 people who presented themselves to the agencies had documentary&#13;
errors.&#13;
* About 391,000 people who presented themselves to the agencies had no&#13;
documentation at all.&#13;
10.     Government estimates that savings of a minimum of US$279 million per year would&#13;
result from correcting these errors. The review and correction of the errors detected requires&#13;
extensive desk-checking against scanty information, applying olcl and sometimes obsolete legal&#13;
frameworks, with site visits in many cases. This effort would be financed under the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
11.     Benefit calculations are carried out under very lax circumstances. A conservative&#13;
estimate puts at US$278 million the savings resulting verification of past grantings.&#13;
12.     An additional US$6 million per year in savings would result from tighter controls&#13;
applied to new grantings.&#13;
13.     A pilot comparison with one provincial fund (Municipality of Buenos Aires), showed&#13;
that 9,000 (14%) of the provincial pensioners received pensions from both pension funds. A&#13;
sample of 800 cases showed that 67% had incompatible pensions. A rough estimate puts the&#13;
savings for all provinces due to double pensions at approximately US$20 million per year.&#13;
14.     There are many other estimates of potential savings. However, given the number of&#13;
files to be reviewed, the lack of documentation, the incomplete merging of the previous 18&#13;
pension programs, and the lack of historical data for comparison, it is not possible to make an&#13;
accurate estimate before more substantial reviews of the files are carried out, reviews which&#13;
would be financed under the proposed project.&#13;
15.     Tentatively and conservatively, the Government has agreed to consider savings of&#13;
US$300 million per year as the absolute minimum to be obtained from the strengthening of&#13;
ANSeS.&#13;
Institutional Status of the Organization&#13;
16.     Before the creation of the National Pension System, pensions were administered by&#13;
about 20 independent organizations (e.g., Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Police and the&#13;
Army), not including provincial administrations. Each organization had different procedures for&#13;
collections, grantings and payments. as well as different benefit rules. In 1991, the National&#13;
Pension Administration (ANSeS) was created as a semi-autonomous institution, merging 18 of&#13;
these organizations. However, the different programs were inadequately merged. For all&#13;
practical purposes, ANSeS administers 18 different programs, each with its own rules,&#13;
personnel and pay scales.&#13;
17.     In 1995, ANSeS decided to carry out an in-depth diagnostic of the institution. A&#13;
consulting firm was selected, and the review of the organization, procedures and staff took&#13;
place during November/December 1995.&#13;
18.     The diagnostic found:&#13;
*  A lack of definition of the mnission of the organization&#13;
*  No long-term planning&#13;
*  No prioritization of objectives&#13;
* Poor service to cLients&#13;
* Little clarity concerning the grantings and payments processes&#13;
*  Uncoordinated and insecure automated systems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
S&#13;
* Inefficient internal organization&#13;
*  No clarity in the responsibilities of management and staff&#13;
*  No clarity in resource ailocation methods&#13;
*  An incentive scheme which did not permit rewards or sanctions&#13;
*  No internal communications&#13;
19.     The diagnostic team found that there was no shared vision of the institution and no&#13;
sense of belonging. There was no attempt to promote on merit, and criteria for promotion&#13;
were at best unclear and at worst passive (seniority, obedience, adherence to the letter of&#13;
instructions). Management had no clear objectives, a vague definition of its responsibilities (the&#13;
same is true for staff), very little information for control and no performance indicators,&#13;
resulting in a clear absence of accountability.&#13;
20.     The functional orientation of the organizational structure was detrimental to&#13;
coordinated effort. For example, an upgrade of agencies requirinlg infrastructure&#13;
improvements, new systems and training of personnel, would be carried out independently by&#13;
three different departments, with at best a loss of synergy, and at worst conflicting activities.&#13;
21.     ANSeS has cultural values based on stability and compliance with form. In the&#13;
absence of a policy for administration and human resources, with no performance measurement&#13;
and with an incentive system based on obscure criteria, salary distortions and low motivation&#13;
have resulted in low morale and endemic corruption. There are fiew highly qualified, and little&#13;
use is made of office equipment.&#13;
22.     The administrative and accounting systems are inadequate. Although about USS300&#13;
million is spent on the administration of ANSeS, no one is sure how this money is spent. There&#13;
is no system of cost centers and no way of evaluating the efficierncy of any area, nor are there&#13;
incentives to use resources efficiently. This results in cases like the following:&#13;
*  The child care center has one employee for every 3 children.&#13;
*  Janitorial services cost an average of US$5,200 each month for every 1000 m2.&#13;
Market rates are closer to $2,000.&#13;
* ANSeS rents many of its locales - yet at the same time it owns numerous empty&#13;
buildings. In Buenos Aires, 20.3% of ANSeS' available office space (123,000 mn2) is&#13;
on "loan" (free) to other state entities; 9 5%  is unused, and 14.2%/0 is misused for&#13;
archiving. A review of space use could save ANSeS about US$5 rnillion a year.&#13;
US$23 million is spent per year in improving the infrastructure. There is no&#13;
measure of effectiveness of this effort, except for the dilapidated state of existing&#13;
buildings, which do not show the effects of this large amount.&#13;
* The number of staff is unknown; although estimated at 8,800. Of these, 279 were&#13;
found in the accounting database (i.e., being paid) but not in the Human Resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
database (i.e., no record of what they do). Another 134 staff were found who&#13;
belonged to no recognizable unit.&#13;
23.     ANSeS' critical Systems and Processes were found to be confusing and inadequate.&#13;
ANSeS staff still apply the original 18 different legal frameworics, there are no clear processes&#13;
and no uniformity on decision criteria (e.g., for awards or disputes), and there are multiple&#13;
systems operating on several databases without control mechanisms.&#13;
24.     The award process has no controls. There are at least four ways to create an illegal&#13;
benefit: for example, upon the death of a person, it is possible to modify the database to&#13;
include a partner (spouse, sibling, child, etc.). There are also no post-award verifications, even&#13;
of the amounts awarded. A total of 340,000 updates are made to the database each month,&#13;
representing an average of US$360 million per year. There is no automated verification, and&#13;
data input has been calculated to have an error rate of 40 percent. The databases do not&#13;
contain sufficient information on past payments, and so pensions are estimated only roughly.&#13;
25.     The payment process is equally unchecked. The banks charge US$90 million per year&#13;
for payments, but there is no control over the length of time or of accuracy. Every month an&#13;
estimated 70,000 payments are not cashed, but no follow-up is carried out. All payment orders&#13;
are printed, even though the vast majority are repetitive and electronic payment orders could&#13;
easily be used. Perhaps the most striking example of the lack of attention to the payment&#13;
process is given by one detail: unlike normal practice, the payment system always rounds up&#13;
centavos to the nearest peso, costing ANSeS a totally unnecessary US$6 million each year.&#13;
26.     Twenty agencies were surveyed. The confusing procedures and lack of information&#13;
are reflected in the length of time taken for grantings and payments. For example,&#13;
Payment of Ordinary Pension:     average 14 days, maximum 302&#13;
Pension due to death of kin:     average 6 days, maximum 90&#13;
Invalidity pension:              average 20 days, maximum 302.&#13;
27.     These numbers reflect several visits by clients to the agencies. Each visit takes on&#13;
average 5.5 hours, and is very uncomfortable as there are only seats for 25 percent of the&#13;
(mostly elderly) clients. Moreover, agencies are very crowded, with an average of one client&#13;
for every square meter.&#13;
28.     To put these numbers into perspective, in Australia (admittedly a well-run social&#13;
security administration), 80% of all invalidity pensions are paid vvithin 2 days, 95% of all&#13;
clients are seen by an agent within 20 minutes (even if without an appointment) or 10 minutes&#13;
(if with an appointment).&#13;
29.     There were many more findings of this nature by the diagnostics team.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
ANSeS Reform Strategy&#13;
30.     The current senior ANSeS management has begun its mandate intent upon&#13;
establishing its credibility and that of ANSeS through a number of targeted early activities&#13;
aimed at achieving quick. tangible and, more important, visible successes. In addition to&#13;
establishing its credibility, they have also sought to create a positive momentum for change&#13;
which would allow it, among other things, to attract badly needed senior management and&#13;
technical talent.&#13;
31.     To this effect, ANSeS has begun the process of establishing a clear vision for the&#13;
organization and establishing effective lines of authority and accountability, with the assistance&#13;
of a consulting firm. Steps were taken to identify key staff who can be counted on to change&#13;
the culture of the organization and to define the new processes and procedures necessary to&#13;
reengineer the entire operation. Efforts are underway to restructure ANSeS, review the&#13;
accounting and management information system (carried out following Bank procedures, with&#13;
a view to retroactive financing), and strengthen internal auditing, as well as to detect and&#13;
correct defective procedures and processes and to establish security and program safeguards.&#13;
32.     The reform is being implemented in two phases. The first or "Emergency" phase was&#13;
aimed at achieving the necessary level of control over the institution by end-1996. The second&#13;
is the more in-depth "Transformation" phase, which the proposed project supports.&#13;
33.     Early activities included:&#13;
3 Carrying out the in-depth diagnostic of ANSeS referred to above, to identify major&#13;
problems and areas of mismanagement and corruption.&#13;
* Defining the mission of ANSeS, by identifying ANSeS' present and future clients,&#13;
defining the products and services which ANSeS will provide, and determining the&#13;
level of service to be provided.&#13;
* Assuming the direction of the entity, including the need to: (i) define responsibilities&#13;
for managers and external advisors; (ii) emphasize internal auditing; (iii) strengthen&#13;
the legal area; and (iv) develop basic managemeni: and control tools.&#13;
* Identifying and recruiting new managers, both within and outside the organization.&#13;
&#149; Defining and implementing an internal communications campaign, which included&#13;
the definition and implementation of a new ANSeS logo and colors.&#13;
* Taking over the computer center. This area in particular was identified as the major&#13;
center of corruption within ANSeS. Given the ease with which sabotage in this area&#13;
would cause ANSeS to immediately stop processing pensions, and the uproar that&#13;
this would cause, there was need for a carefully designed and executed, and secret&#13;
operation. The design of the operation and the infiltration of the computer center&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
took several months and required the help of an international consulting firm. At&#13;
the same time, federal police investigated a number of contracts and suspected&#13;
contacts. Eventually, ANSeS staff, accompanied by a large number of police&#13;
agents, successfully accomplished the "hostile takeover" of the computer center,&#13;
making copies of all archives and systems. Several ex-computer center managers&#13;
have been accused of fraud and are being tried.&#13;
34.     These activities, carried out during project preparation, will be financed retroactively&#13;
from government counterpart funds shortly after project effectiveness. The government has&#13;
agreed to deposit an amount sufficient to cover the retroactive financing as well as the first&#13;
year's counterpart expenditures within three months after project effectiveness.&#13;
Provincial Pension Funds&#13;
35.     On August 12, 1993, the National Government agreed to accept the transfer of the&#13;
Provincial Pension Funds (PPFs) and absorb them into the National Pension System,&#13;
admninistered by the National Social Security Administration (ANSeS).&#13;
36.     Preliminary studies show that the PPFs have higher average contributions and&#13;
benefits than the national system, as well as lower requirements to obtain these benefits. After&#13;
the expected transfer over the next three years of 22 Provinces and one Municipality (Buenos&#13;
Aires), the increase in the number of affiliates at the national level would be approximately&#13;
600,000 individuals (8 percent), and the increase in payments approximately US$4.2 billion&#13;
(27 percent). In addition, administrative errors, fraud and corruption have been determined to&#13;
be substantially higher than in the national system. For example, pensions for invalidity&#13;
comprise in some cases about 20 percent of all pensions. A normal rate would be closer to 4&#13;
percent. A first review of benefit amounts shows a considerable proportion of unexplained&#13;
increases (e.g., one case in which the amount went from US$160 to US$2000).&#13;
37.     The transfer of these systems must therefore be cairried out carefully and&#13;
progressively, simplifying processes and cleaning up files. To this effect, a special Transfer Unit&#13;
has been created within ANSeS, with a mandate to carry out: and manage all activities related&#13;
to the absorption of the PPFs.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
38.     The objectives of this project are to assist ANSeS in improving its institutional&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness along modern management principles in order to: (a) reduce&#13;
instances of improper pension payment; (b) improve the quality of its client services; and (c)&#13;
absorb the administration of the provincial pension fiinds.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
39.     Many attempts at institutional strengthening have suffered from a failure to recognize&#13;
the severe organizational disfunctions at the base of the institution's weakness. By focusing on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
a limited number of key areas, or by failing to address managernent and incentive issues, early&#13;
successes have failed to ensure sustainability. Recognizing this., the proposed project addresses&#13;
the immediate issues of deficit reduction, low quality of client services and the absorption of&#13;
the provincial pension funds through three straightforward components. The fourth component&#13;
addresses institutional issues, centered around the premise that all the main processes of the&#13;
organization must be redesigned completely and concurrently around a shared vision, clearly&#13;
enunciated business processes, coherent management structures and appropriately motivated&#13;
human resources. In addition, the proposed strengthening is predicated on the notion that&#13;
sustainability can only be achieved if the entire culture, structures and premises of the&#13;
organization are refocused to its new goals through the systermatic use of change management&#13;
and facilitation tools and techniques.&#13;
40.     However, the re-inventing of an institution and refocussing of its culture require&#13;
long-term, sustained efforts, beyond the scope of this project. Such a change may take&#13;
upwards of ten years and sustained political will, and would require detailed long-term&#13;
implementation plans which the institution (and most likely no institution in this situation and&#13;
context) cannot prepare at present.&#13;
41.     Rather than attempting to put together a workplan with extremely flexible terms, this&#13;
project limits its scope to a first phase in which efforts are concentrated on putting the house in&#13;
order and laying the groundwork for future change.&#13;
42.     Clearly the proposed project cannot assure sustainability, but it will substantially&#13;
facilitate it. A revised ANSeS, with clear goals and incentives, an interim organizational&#13;
structure, cleaner databases and more efficient procedures, with errors eliminated and fraud&#13;
under control, trained personnel, and an administration conversant with modern techniques of&#13;
management and in change management will permit the full reengineering of its processes&#13;
which ANSeS requires, in a second phase of reform.&#13;
43.     The project will finance technical assistance, consulting firms and the acquisition of&#13;
computer equipment, through four components:&#13;
*  Fraud and Error Control&#13;
Activities in this component aim to reduce inappropriate disbursements due&#13;
to fraud and error by cleaning up existing files, setting up a Fraud Control&#13;
Unit, and agreeing on joint evasion programs with the General Tax&#13;
Directorate.&#13;
Improvement of Client Service Quality&#13;
Agencies will be reorganized to provide one-stop, full service "points of&#13;
sale", and will be provided with new processes and systems, trained&#13;
personnel, and an upgraded infrastructure.&#13;
* Provincial Pension Fund Transfer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
The Provincial Pension Funds of up to 22 provinces will be absorbed into&#13;
the national system after a verification of its files and elimination of errors&#13;
and fraud.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Activities in support of an efficient organization will consist of the&#13;
introduction of a new organizational structure, management techniques,&#13;
incentive system, as well as central monitoring and control and back-office&#13;
operations such as maintaining the central database.&#13;
44.     Project coordination and administration will to a large extent be the responsibility of&#13;
ANSeS management (see attached Resolution by the Ministry of Labor), assisted by two&#13;
consultants financed by the project and an external procurement agent.&#13;
Component I: Fraud and Error Control&#13;
45.     To reduce future errors, ANSeS is engaged in the improvement of its Granting and&#13;
Payment processes and systems, to introduce better monitoring and accounting mechanisms. In&#13;
the second phase of its reform, these processes and systems will be redesigned to conform to&#13;
the new decentralized concepts introduced, as well as making them more transparent, more&#13;
effective, and less costly to operate and maintain.&#13;
46.     In addition to this on-going review of existing systems, ANSeS needs to carry out&#13;
two important activities:&#13;
(a)    a review of its beneficiary files (see results of diagnostic, above); and&#13;
(b)    creation of a Fraud Control Unit, which with Internal Audit will help&#13;
prevent future fraud.&#13;
47.     ANSeS needs to review and clean up its beneficiary files, which at present are the&#13;
cause of the largest identifiable erroneous disbursements. To this effect, a pilot exercise will&#13;
concentrate on one province (about 20,000 cases) and define the methodology for review,&#13;
develop the performance criteria for the work and for its control, calculate the cost/benefit cut-&#13;
off points, validate the methodologies and carry out the review. Based on the results of this&#13;
pilot, upwards of 400,000 files will be reviewed. Some of these files will require personal&#13;
verification. The file audits will therefore be followed up by on-site verification. Some 300,000&#13;
cases have already been identified as requiring site verification. Draft terms for the file review&#13;
have been prepared and can be found in the Project Files.&#13;
48.     The review of the files will be done in portions of approximately 100,000 files, not&#13;
counting the pilot of 20,000. It is not possible at this time to estimate precisely the cost of&#13;
review of each portion, as it depends on the degree of accuracy required, which will vary&#13;
according to findings in each portion, the learning curve of the consultants and staff employed&#13;
(not necessarily the same group throughout, in particular when dealing with on-site verification&#13;
in the provinces and with the review of invalidity claims, which require medical analysis). A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
cost-effectiveness analysis would therefore be carried out at the end of each phase, to permnit&#13;
fine-tuning of the review methodology.&#13;
49.     To prevent the continuation of the prevalent fraudulent practices, a Fraud Control&#13;
Unit will be set up, along the lines of the Inspectorate General in the US. Initial activities&#13;
include the definition of the unit, its mission, objectives, performance indicators and skill mix&#13;
required, among others, and the preparation of prevention, detection and monitoring&#13;
mechanisms, including detection algorithms and the use of cross-referencing with other&#13;
institutions' databases (e.g., DGI, Civil Register, death certificates, etc.).&#13;
Component II: Improvement of Client Service Quality&#13;
50.     To improve services, ANSeS is implementing one-stop point-of-sale with its&#13;
agencies, offering all the services needed by the customer. To do this ANSeS has to devolve&#13;
responsibility for pension grantings, interpretations of the legal framework, and modifications&#13;
of customer data to the agencies. This in tum requires a revision of the granting and payment&#13;
processes to simplify them and automate them in a decentralized mode, using interconnected&#13;
information systems running on a "client-server" architecture, and at the same time introduce&#13;
monitoring and control mechanisms at headquarters. This approach follows the "normative and&#13;
supervisory centralization, operative decentralization" approach of the Second Reform of the&#13;
State and of many modern institutions.&#13;
51.     To implement the Full Service Agency (Unidades de Asistencia Integral, UTDAI), a&#13;
service strategy will be developed, personnel and managemeni: of the agenciies will be trained,&#13;
and the offices refurbished and provided with new computer equipment. These agencies will be&#13;
of one of three forms, depending on clientele. The "typical" UDAI will have approximately 60&#13;
people; the "minimal" LTDAI will have 5 people (including the manager), and the "mobile"&#13;
UJDAI, which will concentrate on people unable to come to the agencies, will consist of a&#13;
vehicle, one driver and two staff. Other ways of providing services are being considered, such&#13;
as using the telephone and the postal services.&#13;
52.     Full services require full and correct information, which in turn will require:&#13;
*  Structural reorganization of ANSeS' operations (i.e., revision of granting&#13;
and payment processes);&#13;
*  Unified guidelines for grantings, awards and modifications of pensions;&#13;
*  New definitions of functions and performance indicators at staff and&#13;
management level;&#13;
*  Introduction of incentive systems rewarding good performance;&#13;
*  Training of managers and staff (at headquarters and in agencies);&#13;
*  Central monitoring and auditing; and&#13;
*  An error-free database, and secure and efficient automated systems&#13;
providing access to all the customer's information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
53.     The operations of the UDAI will be supported from headquarters by several&#13;
Directorates, which will need to be strengthened (see Component IV, Institutional&#13;
Strengthening, below): Administration (procurement); Finance (Accounting. Budgeting and&#13;
Treasury); Information Systems (all automated systems and telecommunications);&#13;
Communications (information dissemination); Human Resources (selection. traning and&#13;
planning); Legal (simplification of frameworks and interpretation of difficult cases); and&#13;
Internal Audit.&#13;
54.     Work has already started on this component; ten UDAIs are in the process of being&#13;
constituted, and about 170,000 pending cases have been processed. There is at present no&#13;
granting backlog.&#13;
55.     Not included in this project is a complementary and necessary infrastructure&#13;
development exercise being carried out by ANSeS. Its main objective is to redesign the&#13;
location and physical structure of the agencies to make themr of easier access and use by the&#13;
client (and staff). In some cases new buildings will have to be rented or built; for example,&#13;
when a new clientele is brought into ANSeS (i.e., the Provincial Pension Funds). Other&#13;
objectives of this exercise are to establish a new headquarters building (in process), centralize&#13;
the archives, and re-evaluate infrastructure requirements and assets. More information on this&#13;
activity can be found in the Project Files, including plans for the new UDAIs.&#13;
Component mU: Provincial Pension Fund Transfer&#13;
56.     Ten provinces have already agreed formally to the transfer (Salta, Tucuman,&#13;
Mendoza, San Juan, Santiago del Estero, Catamarca, Rio Negro, Jujuy and La Rioja, plus the&#13;
Municipality of Buenos Aires, considered a province). It is expected that almost all the&#13;
provinces will eventually agree.&#13;
57.     The transfer of these systems must therefore be carried out carefully and&#13;
progressively, simplifying processes and cleaning up files. To this effect, a special Transfer Unit&#13;
has been created within ANSeS, with a mandate to carry out and manage all activities related&#13;
to the absorption of the PPFs.&#13;
58.     The absorption of the provincial pension funds will entail a transition process during&#13;
which these funds will be processed independently. Before full absorption into the national&#13;
system, all provincial pension files will have to be reviewed.&#13;
59.     During this process, technical assistance will be provided to assist ANSeS staff to&#13;
process payments under different provincial pension rules, as pensions granted before 1995 will&#13;
continue to operate under the original provincial rules. After ANSeS' critical pension processes&#13;
have been extensively overhauled, the pension files will be merged with the national system's.&#13;
Component IV: Institutional Strengthening&#13;
60.     The organization, structure and management processes of ANSeS have been&#13;
diagnosed as insufficient and ineffective. Furthermore, they are totally incompatible with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
emerging vision, which requires introducing private sector management practices, processes&#13;
and systems, resulting in an ANSeS which has:&#13;
*  A formal and informal organization aligned with ANSeS' objectives.&#13;
*  An error-free database, secure and efficient automated systems.&#13;
&#149;  Unified guidelines for grantings, awards and modifications of pensions.&#13;
* A high level of control and accountability, and delegation of authority and&#13;
responsibility.&#13;
*  An incentive system designed to reward performance.&#13;
* Trained and motivated staff.&#13;
* One-stop agencies offering all the services needed by the customer.&#13;
61.     Efforts will focus on introducing a culture based on service and accountability, and&#13;
on building ANSeS' capacity for analysis, planning, budgeting, process accounting, and&#13;
monitoring. The change program will also focus on the management of human resources and&#13;
on ways to improve the productivity of ANSeS' workforce. Incentive and motivation systems&#13;
will be overhauled, combining performance measurements with financial incentives, and backed&#13;
by a comprehensive skills inventory and training program.&#13;
62.     Initial activities in this area, to be financed through counterpart funds released to&#13;
ANSeS by the Ministry of Economy towards the beginning of' 1997, consist of the initial&#13;
diagnostic and proposals for the revision of critical processes and file verification, as well as&#13;
the design of the Full Service Agencies. Most importantly, the vision of ANSeS was defined,&#13;
and the value analysis of all activities has already begun.&#13;
63.     Changes in senior management have been a common source of disruption in technical&#13;
assistance projects. To help prevent this, a Steering Committee has been constituted. This&#13;
Committee, chaired by the Secretary of Social Security and composed of specialists in&#13;
management and social security, will review and approve the semi-annual progress reports and&#13;
workplans presented by the National Director, providing continuity in the case of a change in&#13;
senior management and thereby further reducing the chance of possible disruption in project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
64.     Management of change, especially a comprehensive organizational and cultural&#13;
change as envisaged for ANSeS, requires special skills in management not usually found in&#13;
institutions in either the public or the private sector. As mentioned before, an effort is being&#13;
made to attract managers to lead the ANSeS reform process. These managers will receive&#13;
training in modern management techniques as well as that subset of management known as&#13;
change management.&#13;
65.     A network of change facilitation teams, workgroups and committees is being&#13;
established to promote participation and insure that the full range of activities required to&#13;
manage change is undertaken in a systematic and timely fashion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
66.     Senior management also seeks to increase its internal credibility and achieve&#13;
employee commitment through a sustained communication effort and through the introduction&#13;
of significant changes such as performance pay and accountability regimes. The&#13;
communications process has already begun, with a new internal communications policy, an&#13;
institutional magazine, and documentation and presentations to staff on the reforn objectives&#13;
and strategy.&#13;
67.     An important part of the institutional strengthening will be the introduction of inter-&#13;
institutional contracts between ANSeS units, both for goal-setting and performance evaluation&#13;
and for the hiring of services from internal and external providers. Training is a prime example&#13;
of the hiring of services. While some very specialized training may be offered within the&#13;
organization, it is expected that most of the training will be competitively bid in the private&#13;
sector. Another example is informatics, in which both hardware and software is likely to be&#13;
provided by third parties.&#13;
68.     The Finance and Administrative sub-directorate has deteriorated perhaps more than&#13;
other areas of ANSeS; little financial management information is available for decision-making.&#13;
Efforts will be made to strengthen this area through a review of procedures, development of&#13;
management information systems, and training. In particular, the following activities would be&#13;
carried out:&#13;
* Design and implementation of a Management Information System&#13;
* Revision of the budget system&#13;
- Renegotiation of all service contracts&#13;
-- Revision of the accounting system&#13;
- Revision of the procurement system&#13;
* Recreation of the Human Resources Database.&#13;
69.     The work to be done in inforrnatics is very large, basically a realignment of the&#13;
Informatics Directorate towards a service orientation. The quality of its in-house informatics&#13;
resources and its outsourcing capabilities would be improved. A user requirement identification&#13;
and a client/user integrated planning capacity would be created, as well as the planning and&#13;
implementation of a world class multi-tier network which will require the re-development of&#13;
all major systems and the introduction of modern telecommunications.&#13;
70.     Activities in this area will take place in three phases:&#13;
*  Short-term activities aimed at ensuring that current operations are maintained at&#13;
their present level and that short-term actions such as backlogs and cleanups are&#13;
resolved.&#13;
*  Intermediate activities intended to maximize the usefulness of current informatics&#13;
resources while the long-term strategy is being developed, and&#13;
*  A long-term strategy, which will be based on detailed client and business process&#13;
requirements, using appropriate technological solutions. This strategy will develop&#13;
operational, administrative and management information systems aimed at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
processing and delivering the information required, on time, within specifications, in&#13;
the appropriate formats and in the most user-friendly environment. In addition, a&#13;
migration plan will be implemented to take all data in its intermediate form to the&#13;
final Consolidated Database version.&#13;
71.     Most of this very large effort is already being carried out by ANSeS. The proposed&#13;
project would help the develop new informatics policies, reengineer the Informatics&#13;
Directorate, and provide training and procurement assistance.&#13;
72.     The satisfactory development of human resources in ANSeS has been hindered by the&#13;
lack of flexibility in current legislation, and by the application of outmoded management&#13;
principles emphasizing form over function. The absence of rewards or sanctions for&#13;
performance and the lack of targeted training are only two of the conditions which have led&#13;
ANSeS to its present situation of lack of managerial and staff accountability, demoralization&#13;
and low skill levels.&#13;
73.     It is therefore necessary to:&#13;
3  Define a new Incentive Policy for management and staff, based on&#13;
performance&#13;
*  Obtain a more flexible labor agreement;&#13;
*  Define a new policy for the selection and promotion of personnel;&#13;
*  Define a new policy for the identification of training needs, provision of&#13;
training and measurement of results;&#13;
* Define internal search criteria and prepare a search plan;&#13;
* Carry out a skills inventory;&#13;
*  Prepare and implement a Training Plan; and&#13;
*  Develop a Human Resource Information System.&#13;
74.     In addition, senior management is planning the introduction of carefully targeted&#13;
training aimed at enhancing staff capacity in critical processes&#13;
Project Administration&#13;
75.     The project will be coordinated by ANSeS' management. To assist them in the&#13;
administration of activities financed by the Bank, an administrative unit has been established, in&#13;
charge of procurement and accounting, and of ensuring that EBank procedures are followed. An&#13;
experienced administrator (five years of direct experience with the Bank, IDB, UJNDP and the&#13;
UN Office for Project Services - UN/OPS) has been identified and hired part-time by ANSeS.&#13;
After effectiveness the administrator, as well as an experienced accountant (not yet identified.&#13;
but the same profile is required), will be financed by the Bankc. ANSeS line staff will comprise&#13;
the remainder of the unit.&#13;
76.     A project accounting and monitoring system is already in place (transferred from&#13;
another Bank project), the Bank would finance its upgrade to set it in line with the latest Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
requirements for monitonrng, accounting and auditing. An outline progress report has been&#13;
agreed (in draft Terms of Reference for project auditing in the 1project files).&#13;
77.     Thus, by financing a small number of experienced staff (two) and putting in place a&#13;
monitoring and accounting system, project administration costs would be minimized. By using&#13;
line staff for the remainder of the unit, institutionalization of project administration skills is&#13;
facilitated.&#13;
Other Expenses: External Administration&#13;
78.     ANSeS is considering entering into an external administration agreement with a UN&#13;
organization. This type of agreement is frequent in Argentina because:&#13;
*  Under the existing law, only staff of Secretary of State rank can contract in the&#13;
name of the State; all others must do so personally. This exposes the great majority&#13;
of National Directors and Project Coordinators to being sued, which, given the&#13;
amount of litigation in Argentina, is common. As a consequence, most National&#13;
Directors and Project Coordinators are loath to assume this responsibility.&#13;
-  It also permits the government to eliminate paying value-added taxes as counterpart&#13;
for consultants and goods. On this argument alone, such an agreement, which costs&#13;
3-5 percent of the total project, is worth considering, as the value-added tax stands&#13;
today at 21 percent.&#13;
79.     The Bank would finance this agreement.&#13;
80.     Project audits would be financed by ANSeS. Draft Terms of Reference for project&#13;
auditing can be found in the project files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
SECTION B:&#13;
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Agencies Involved&#13;
1.    The National Social Secunrtv Administration (ANSeS) will be the executing agency for&#13;
this project, and will be responsible for providing counterpart ftnds. The Executive Director of&#13;
ANSeS will be project's National Director. The Ministry of Economy will provide US$20 million&#13;
for counterpart financing. The first installment, of US$ 10 million, will cover preparatory activities&#13;
already carried out and counterpart expenditures for the first year of implementation. Further&#13;
installments of US$4 million, US$4 million and US$2 rnillion will be made before the end of the&#13;
first, second and third years of implementation, respectively.&#13;
Project Execution&#13;
2.    The proposed project would be completed in four years The completion date is December&#13;
31, 2000, and the Closing Date is June 30, 2001. The National Director will be responsible for&#13;
project execution as planned, within time and budget, and with ensuring compliance with all Loan&#13;
Agreements. Bank requirements for accounting, administration and procurement procedures will&#13;
be the responsibility of the Project Administration Unit (see below).&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.    Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised January and August&#13;
1996). The bulk of the procurement of goods consists of computer equipment and software for an&#13;
estimated USS3.4 million equivalent which will be acquired in packages of not less than USS 350,000&#13;
equivalent each by International Competitive Bidding (1CB). No National Competitive Bidding is&#13;
contemplated. Miscellaneous computer equipment and software and office and photocopying&#13;
equipment required for project implementation and administration, will be acquired by National&#13;
Shopping by price comparisons of at least three quotations, in packages valued at less than&#13;
USS50,000, up to an aggregate of US$500,000 over the life of the project.&#13;
4.    Consulting services will be contracted in accordance with the Guidelinesfor the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August&#13;
1981). Out of the total loan amount. USS16.2 million is allocated for consulting services. To the&#13;
extent possible, the Borrower would employ consulting firms in preference to individual&#13;
consultants for the provision of consulting services to the Project. Individual consultants would be&#13;
financed out of the loan only with the prior written approval of the Bank on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
5.    Standard contracts, based on the Bank-issued Standard Form of Contracts, and procurement&#13;
documentation, based on Bank Standard Bidding Documents, modified as necessary for the purposes&#13;
of the project, were agreed with the Government (and the procurement agency where appropriate)&#13;
during Negotiations. Agreement was also obtained on formats for the technical specifications in the&#13;
case of goods; terms of reference (including objectives, activities, results, performance indicators, and&#13;
estimated breakdown of costs) and the use of the Bank's standard Letter of Invitation, for consulting&#13;
services.&#13;

Bank Prior Review&#13;
6.    Prior review by the Bank will be exercised for:&#13;
* All goods procured through ICB and consultant contracts under US$100,000&#13;
equivalent (in the case of consulting firms) and uncder US$50,000 (in the case of&#13;
individual consultants); however, in all cases the Bank would exercise review of terms&#13;
of reference for individual consultants or firms.&#13;
7.    All contracts would be subject to post-review sampling during supervision missions.&#13;
Current arrangements assure that the substantive aspects of 90 percent of contracts will be&#13;
reviewed ex-ante by the Bank.&#13;
Disbursements and Special Account&#13;
8.    The Borrower's financial administration regulations have been reviewed in the context of&#13;
previous projects and have been found acceptable for use with a Special Account.&#13;
9.    Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made against 100 percent' of all activities&#13;
identified for Bank financing, exclusive of taxes. The Government is considering entering into an&#13;
agreement with a UN agency for the administration of the project and procurement of goods, following&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank, for an aggregate amount of US$16 million. The remainder, US$4&#13;
million, would be disbursed using a Special Account in US dollars, with an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$250,000 equivalent, for an estimated four months of average disbursements.&#13;
10.   The Special Account would be established in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
The National Social Security Administration would be entitled to make periodic withdrawals from&#13;
the Special Account for eligible expenditures upon request from the National Project Director at&#13;
the exchange rate applicable on the day such account is debited. The Bank would replenish the&#13;
Special Account for the amount of withdrawals for eligible expenditures at the request of the&#13;
Borrower.&#13;
11.   Disbursements would be made on the basis of Statemenits of Expenditure (SOE) for goods&#13;
contracts procured as allowed under national shopping procedures, as well as consultants'&#13;
contracts not subject to prior review. The documentation for these expenditures would be&#13;
consolidated and maintained by the Project Administration Unit (PAU), and made available for&#13;
the required audit as well as to Bank staff during supervision missions. All other expenditures&#13;
would also be fully documented, and copies of contracts woulcl be sent to the Bank. Applications&#13;
for direct payment and special commitments may be submitted to the Bank provided they are for&#13;
amounts equivalent to at least 20 percent of the Authorized Allocation of the Special Account.&#13;
Agreement on the use of the Special Account and Statements of Expenditure were obtained at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
Accounting and Audits&#13;
12.   The Project Administration Unit will upgrade their exislting project accounting and&#13;
performance monitoring system. The formats of the reports produced were agreed during&#13;
Only if procured through a tax-exempt procurement agency; otherwise disbursements will be made against 82 percent of the&#13;
cost of these activities, to take into account the current Argentine VAT of2l percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Negotiations. The accounting system will facilitate the monitoring of the project's financial&#13;
information to ensure that all project expenditures and commitments are consistent with the -&#13;
project's agreed allocations, including their expenditure categories. The accounting system will&#13;
provide information to the government on the project's financial progress.&#13;
13.   Annual Audits of the project accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, will be&#13;
perforrned in accordance with appropriate auditing principles applied by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank (draft terms of reference for auditors can be found in the project files).&#13;
The auditors will: (a) audit the Special Account, SOEs and summary sheets; (b) audit&#13;
procurement procedures to report on their compliance with no-objections and Bank procedures&#13;
and guidelines; (c) apply auditing standards and procedures satisfactory to the Bank which&#13;
conform to generally accepted auditing practices; (d) carry out their auditing work in a timely&#13;
manner - an audit report will be presented to the Bank no later than April 30, four months after&#13;
the end of the fiscal year; and (e) render an audit opinion or provide reasons why such an opinion&#13;
cannot be rendered.&#13;
Project Administration&#13;
14.   The Project Administration Unit (PAU) will be headed by a project administrator, and&#13;
composed of a senior and a junior accountant, a senior and a junior procurement specialist, two&#13;
admninistrative assistants and a junior assistant. The project administrator and senior accountant&#13;
will be financed by the project, and should have over three years' substantive experience with&#13;
Bank procedures and external administration agency procedures. The remaining staff will be&#13;
selected from counterpart personnel, and given formal and on-the-job training.&#13;
15.   The PAU will report to the Project General Coordinator. Its responsibilities will be to:&#13;
* monitor the execution and evaluation of project activities,&#13;
* monitor the availability of funds from all financing sources,&#13;
* manage and keep records of all procurement operations, ensuring compliance with&#13;
Bank guidelines,&#13;
* monitor compliance with legal covenants,&#13;
* maintain records for all activities,&#13;
* manage contracting of technical assistance and consulting services under the project&#13;
* prepare the semi-annual progress reports and ensure their submission to the Bank on&#13;
time,&#13;
* ensure the timely preparation of the annual audit reports (including SOEs and&#13;
accounts), and&#13;
* prepare relevant portions of the Implementation Completion Report at the close of the&#13;
project.&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
16.   The National Director through the project administrator will be responsible for monitoring&#13;
project implementation activities as described in the Project Implementation Plan. Annual Action&#13;
Plans will be prepared, describing in detail the activities, personnel responsible for their execution,&#13;
how the performance of the various activities will be measured and by whom, and other&#13;
information necessary for the execution of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
The National Director will formally present a Semi-Annual Progress Report to a Steering&#13;
Committee, chaired by the Secretary of Social Security in the Ministry of Labor. This report will&#13;
provide financial and procurement information on project execution as well as performance&#13;
indicators to date (input, output, outcome and impact) as described in the last Annual Action&#13;
Plan. The Steering Committee will review and approve the Progress Report, including proposed&#13;
new Annual Action Plans. These plans will be agreed with the Bank during project supervision in&#13;
September of each year. Agreement on the outline of the semi-annual progress report was&#13;
obtained during Negotiations.&#13;

17.   A Mid-Term Review will be carried out jointly by the B3ank and ANSeS during the March&#13;
1999 supervision mission, to measure project progress and impact and agree on activities for the&#13;
remainder of the project. This review would also serve as an opportunity to assess the need and&#13;
feasibility for a potential follow-up technical assistance loan. This condition was agreed at&#13;
Negotiations. The Mid-term review will provide a formal opportunity for the Bank to assess&#13;
covenant compliance by the Borrower and ANSeS with regard to the Project, an opportunity&#13;
which the Bank nevertheless will have at all other times as well pursuant to the General&#13;
Conditions incorporated in the Loan Agreement for this Project.&#13;
18.   An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be submitted to the Bank after project&#13;
completion and no later than six months after the Loan Closing Date. Included in the ICR will be&#13;
an assessment of the execution of the project, costs and benefits derived, the performance of the&#13;
Borrower, the World Bank and other agencies involved in their respective obligations and&#13;
accomplishments, and lessons learned.&#13;

ADplication of Lessons Learned in Technical Assistance Proiects'&#13;
Unfavorable Governance Conditions:&#13;
Unhelpful institutional environment              Management is of particular attention to ANSeS. Three out of 4 managers at the Directorate level are newly&#13;
Lack of managers; functions not aligned with     hired, through head-hunters and advertisements, from the private sector; out of 8 senior managers in the next&#13;
objectives; unwieldy organizational structure and  rank, 4 have been hired, 2 ratified in their posts, 2 posts are vacant. At the third level, 29 out of 42 managers&#13;
procedures.                                      have been hired or selected from within the organization; the other posts are vacant&#13;
A new structure according to newly agreed objectives has been defined and is being implemented. All&#13;
procedures are being reviewed to facilitate operationality and accountability.&#13;
Systemic problems:                               The recently-begun Second Reform of the State is addressing basic legal impediments to the introduction of&#13;
Inadequate incentives and struclures.            better incentives and structures. This project will finance their revision within ANSeS.&#13;
Lack of Ownership:&#13;
Supplier-driven objectives                       To a certain extent this is true, as there is a (very natural) tendency for Borrowers to concentrate in the here&#13;
and now and leave longer term planning and issues of sustainability for later. The Bank's role in helping the&#13;
client to focus on the latter is very important in this context.&#13;

beneficiaries in project design stages.&#13;
ANeedfor a Champion                              This is crucial in this type of IDTA. A champion is in place now, but given the numerous government changes&#13;
in the past months, and the intense pressure to which champions are subjected, their continuity is always&#13;
doubtfuil. To dcal with this risk, tlhrece lines of action are considered:&#13;
(a) The position of General Manager was created, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer.&#13;
The General Manager is a hand-picked second champion.&#13;
(b) The CEO will report periodically to a Steering Committee chaired by the Subsecretary of Social&#13;
Security, which approves the semi-annual plans submitted to the Bank and will provide continuity in&#13;
case of a change in champions.&#13;
(c) In the event of a total change, and given the importance of the champion to implementation, the&#13;
Bank will reserve the right to cancel the loan if it considers that the replacements are not willing or&#13;
able to continue implementation as planned.&#13;
Dependency syndrome                              At present there is a recognized dependency on consulting firms. Institutionalization will be a goal of all&#13;
future activities, measured by outcome indicators.&#13;

Shortcomings of the project mnodel                Future activities are highly dependent on the results of initial activities. For cxample, only after tlie review of&#13;
the first 20,000 or so files will enough information be available to carry out a cost/benefit analysis on the&#13;
scope of this exercise. To err on the side of caution, only 500,000 files are scheduled for review in this stage.&#13;
However, it is strongly felt that at least 1,000,000 files will eventually have to be reviewed. During the mid-&#13;
term review, the need for a follow-on project will be studied&#13;
Too little focus on capacity use vs. capacity     intensive use of own staff is planned, and a comprehensive training program will be implemented.&#13;
building.&#13;
Ioo maniy unpriorilized objectives and components    The scope of the project is limited to one agency; priorities are set and revised by a project committee&#13;
composed of the agency's senior management.&#13;
Absence of appropriate performance indicators.     A Key Objectives and Performance Indicators Table has been prepared and can be found in the Techinical&#13;
Annex (page 31).&#13;
Too much or too little design flexibility         The implementation is designed to take into account the necd for flexibility as implementation proceeds. The&#13;
annual Plan of Action agreed with the Bank, as well as the mid-term review (see above) are designed to&#13;
preclude excessivC flexibility. &#13;

Rent-seeking permitted                            A Fraud Control Unit will be formed to fight corruption.&#13;
Unsuitable expatriate experts; underuse or overuse    To minimize damage, expatriate consultants will be hired for short periods of time and their terms of&#13;
of local consultants                             reference will request results instead of defining functions. To preclude overuse of local consultants, only two&#13;
local individual consultants are planned (project administrator and project accountant). Given the healthy&#13;
state of Argentina's consulting industry and the prevalent strong desire to utilize local consultants, underuse&#13;
is not an issue.&#13;
Inadequate monitoring, evaluation and             Terms of reference have already been issued to request offers for a financial management system; a financial&#13;
accountability.                                   information system will be implemented through this project; internal contracts and a service orientation will&#13;
introduce evaluation and accountability.&#13;
Inadequate change/closure of nonperforming        Performance indicators will assist in identifying slow performing components; a decision on their&#13;
components; slow response to new opportunities.   continuation will be formally made during supervision missions, but can be made at any other time if&#13;
necessary. As to the second, the fact that there is no separately -financed Project Coordination or&#13;
Implementation Unit (since senior managers are responsible for project execution) ensures that issues will not&#13;
be ignored by the agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Supplier Shortcomings:&#13;
Insufficiently experienced staff              As mentioned above, managers will be trained and also supported by an experienced project administrator.&#13;
All other activities will be carried out by consulting firms with a mandate to institutionalize their activities.&#13;
Inadequate supervision and management oversight   A management information system will assist the Project Implementation Team, lcd by ANSeS' General&#13;
Manager. Monthly reports on project implementation by activity will be reviewed by the Team.&#13;
Inadequate monitoring and evaluation, and     Agreement with the Bank on annual Work Plans and Targets is a loan condition. Responsibilities for&#13;
accountability                                monitoring and evaluation are part of the Project Implementation Team's terms of reference.&#13;
Suipplier tYing of T,i and poor donor coordination    No other donors arc involved.&#13;

            Technical Assistance Project

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the National Pension
            Administration Technical Assistance Project are to assist
            the National Social Security Administration (ANSeS) in
            improving its institutional efficiency and effectiveness
            along modern management principles in order to (1) reduce
            instances of improper pension payment, (2) improve the
            quality of its client services, and (3) absorb the
            administration of the provincial pension funds. The project
            will be implemented over a four-year period. It will finance
            technical assistance, consulting firms and the acquisition
            of computer equipment, through five components. Activities
            in the fraud and error component aim to reduce unwarranted
            disbursements by desk-checking existing paper files,
            carrying out on-site visits, and updating the beneficiary
            database. The second component aims to reorganize agencies
            to provide one-stop, full-service points of sale, while the
            remaining components focus on institutional strengthening
            which introduces a new organizational structure, management
            techniques, and incentives linked to performance; on project
            administration with key personnel and accounting and
            monitoring systems Bank-financed; and lastly, on the
            absorption into the national system of 22 provincial pension
            funds, after their files are verified and screened for
            errors and fraud.
