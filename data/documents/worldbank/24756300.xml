                                                         Empirical evidence has been found for both theories. However, literature reviews conclude that the first effect â&#128;&#148; the â&#128;&#156;self-&#13;

                                                     (2007) find that firms are more productive before they start exporting compared to those that will not export. Furthermore, once&#13;
                                                     firms start exporting, they typically continue exporting.&#13;

                                                         Seminal models by Melitz (2003) and Bernard and others (2003) have introduced effective competition in domestic markets&#13;
                                                     as the mechanism through which more productive firms enter the markets, and through which the most productive competitors&#13;
                                                     win additional market share. This contributes to an increase in aggregate productivity levels and higher exports.&#13;

                                                         Finally, the empirical literature shows that domestic competition is also an important driver of firm-level productivityâ&#128;&#148; even&#13;

            Export competitiveness: Why Domestic Market
            Competition Matters
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This review of the empirical literature
            shows that industries with more intense domestic competition
            will export more. Competition law enforcement can be traced
            to export performance and is complementary to trade reforms.
            Pro-competition market regulation that reduces restrictions
            and promotes competition, where it is viable, is an
            important determinant for trade. The elimination of barriers
            to entry and rivalry, and a level playing field in upstream
            sectors contributes to export competitiveness in downstream
            manufacturing sectors. In some sectors, effective
            competition policy can directly lower trade costs.
