            Reinventing government in New Zealand - how
            core government functions benefited from market-type measurement
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the early 1990s, the New Zealand
            government started publishing a balance sheet and operating
            statement, using private sector accounting and reporting.
            These reports --the first such sovereign accounts anywhere--
            typify reforms instituted across government trading
            operating, departments, and other public entities to improve
            performance and accountability. This note reviews the more
            recent reforms arising from the accounts, highlighting some
            of the underlying ideas that may have applications in other countries.
