Utility partnerships with small-scale providers (SSPs) are becoming increasingly important as&#13;
utilities struggle to serve a growing population and the poor in particular. This article explores a&#13;
delegated management approach as one type of partnership and introduces a case study from&#13;

&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
Although the DMM in Nyalenda is&#13;
targeted to low-income consumers&#13;
and is on a smaller scale than&#13;
many other delegated management&#13;
arrangements in the water sector,&#13;
the critical principles for success&#13;
remain the same. These principles&#13;
include: (a) transparency in the&#13;
bidding process; (b) clear contractual&#13;
arrangements; and (c) the right&#13;
financial incentives for all parties. The&#13;
Nyalenda experiment shows that the&#13;
model has clear merits, as has been&#13;
demonstrated in other contexts such&#13;
as Manila in the Philippines, where the&#13;
utility is privately run (Inocencio 2001).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Kisumu, the approach has given&#13;
the water company the confidence&#13;
to move into a low-income area and&#13;
formalize services. It has also helped&#13;
the company to reduce non-revenue&#13;
water6 and improve the quality and&#13;
affordability of services to the poor&#13;
in a financially viable manner. The&#13;
overriding lesson from the Kisumu&#13;
case is that the utility must commit&#13;
to transfer the existing customers,&#13;
eliminate illegal connections, and&#13;
invest and take the lead in community&#13;
outreach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The results to date are very&#13;
encouraging, but the full benefits of&#13;
the delegated management model in&#13;
Kisumu will only be seen when all the&#13;
consumers are served through the            Master Operators undergoing hands-on training&#13;
MO lines. The DMM should be scaled&#13;
up in Kisumu and it could well be&#13;
replicated in other countries that have&#13;
a supportive policy framework and                                                        6Although billing efficiency has improved overall in&#13;

            Improving water utility services through
            delegated management :  lessons from the utility and
            small-scale providers in Kisumu, Kenya
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This field note describes a successful
            technical and management approach for providing safe and
            affordable water to the informal settlements of Kisumu,
            Kenya's third largest city. In this approach, this is
            one of many delegated management models; the water utility
            sells bulk water to community contractors, who then sell it
            to households or kiosk vendors. The main water service
            provider offers contractors, termed 'master
            operators' (MOs), a bulk supply tariff. In turn, the
            master operators are responsible for minor maintenance, such
            as the repair of small leaks, and the management of customer
            interfaces. The results to date are very encouraging, but
            the full benefits of the delegated management model in
            Kisumu will only be seen when all the consumers are served
            through the MO lines. The delegated management model (DMM)
            should be scaled up in Kisumu and it could well be
            replicated in other countries that have a supportive policy
            framework and adequate supply of water.
