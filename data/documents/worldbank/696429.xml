REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA&#13;
ENERGY EFFICIENCY / HOUSING PILOT PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                Republic of Lithuania&#13;
Implementing Agency:     Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD), Ministry of&#13;
Finance, and the municipalities of Vilnius and Kaunas (possibly others).&#13;
Beneficiaries:           Homeowners and homeowvners' associations, participating municipalities,&#13;
participating commercial banks, MCUD, construction industry.&#13;
Poverty Category:        Not applicable.&#13;
IBRD Loan Amount:        US$10.0 million&#13;
Loan Terms:              Payable in twenty years, including five years of grace, at standard LIBOR-&#13;
based variable interest rate for US dollar single currency loans with an&#13;
expected disbursement period of four years.&#13;
Commnitment Fee:         0.75% on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less&#13;
any waiver.&#13;
Onlending Terms:         The onlending terms are designed in a manner consistent with the pilot nature&#13;
of the operation, so as to ensure that the project's expected demonstration&#13;
effects and the economic externalities will be achieved. They will be&#13;
reviewed and revised as appropriate at regular intervals throughout&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(i) For residential energy efficiency rehabilitations - from the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF) through participating commercial banks to homeownersI&#13;
associations and individual homeowners in local currency for three to ten&#13;
years maturity at fixed rates, with Government assuming the foreign&#13;
exchange risk. The banks would: (a) bear full credit risk for lending to&#13;
owners of single family homes and individual apartments, and charge an&#13;
agreed spread; and (b) bear no risk for lending to homeowners' associations&#13;
for which they would receive an administrative fee for service based on&#13;
disbursed and collected funds (during project implementation, commercial&#13;
banks will be given the option to switch to full or partial credit-risk bearing&#13;
for lending to homeowners' associations). Funds will be onlent, for the first&#13;
six months of project implementation, at an interest rate of 15% (consumer&#13;
rate) which is expected to provide an incentive for homeowners to participate&#13;
in the project. The size of the Government contribution will depend on the&#13;
difference between an applicable market reference rate and the consumer&#13;
rate. The onlending terms will be reviewed and adjusted semi-annually based&#13;
on market rates and borrower acceptance. For transparency, beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
will be notified regularly of the market reference rate and the Government&#13;
contribution received.&#13;
(ii) For energy efficiency rehabilitation of schools - from MOF to&#13;
municipalities on the same terms as the Bank loan to the Republic of&#13;
Lithuania.&#13;
Project Objectives:        This project is a pilot or demonstration effort that aims to: (i) support private&#13;
initiative to improve residential energy efficiency; (ii) support public&#13;
initiatives in improving energy efficiency in schools; and (iii) support the&#13;
implementation of Government policies to sustain the privatization of&#13;
housing, enabling increased private initiative in housing maintenance in&#13;
general. The project will: (a) promote and facilitate energy efficiency&#13;
rehabilitation of buildings, introducing technically and economically&#13;
attractive packages of measures which are affordable to a broad range of&#13;
citizens; (b) promote private initiative in housing and energy efficiency&#13;
through supporting the organization of homeowners into functioning&#13;
associations able to take charge of their buildings and housing maintenance;&#13;
(c) support municipalities in the energy efficiency rehabilitation of schools&#13;
for demonstration purposes, (d) develop the use of private energy consultants&#13;
for housing retrofits, and (e) introduce the commercial banking sector to the&#13;
concept of long-term lending for housing and housing improvements.&#13;
Project Description:       The proposed project would consist of the following three components: (a) credit,&#13;
through commercial banks, for residential energy efficiency rehabilitation, with&#13;
incentives for homeowners to encourage participation; (b) energy efficiency&#13;
rehabilitation of schools in selected municipalities; and (c) institutional&#13;
strengthening, to be achieved through substantial technical assistance to address&#13;
key issues with all relevant stakeholders, including homeowners and their&#13;
associations, commercial banks, and contractors and energy efficiency&#13;
consultants. As part of the institutional strengthening, several policy studies&#13;
will be undertaken to develop recommendations for government policy&#13;
regarding assistance to the housing sector and a detailed action plan to&#13;
refocus and target the existing assistance to the neediest in society.&#13;
Project Benefits:          The main benefit of this pilot project lies in its focus on private initiative in&#13;
housing, encouraging individuals and groups of citizens to take charge of&#13;
their housing assets, something still very new in former Soviet Union (FSU)&#13;
countries. Supporting individuals to participate in homeowners' associations&#13;
is expected to improve and sustain the privatization of housing, and the&#13;
citizens' approach and commitment to democratic decision-making processes&#13;
and organizations. While these benefits are hard to quantify, the project's&#13;
quantifiable benefits, evaluated based on resource savings to the economy,&#13;
are expected to be substantial, as demonstrated in an economic rate of return&#13;
of approximately 26%. Other non-quantifiable benefits lie in the project's&#13;
demand side focus which is expected to increase awareness among citizens of&#13;
their ability to change consumption patterns and conserve energy. This&#13;
would, provide, over time, an incentive for the energy supply side to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ill -&#13;
undertake system rehabilitations, and reduce the reliance on imported fuel&#13;
with related reduction in air pollution. Other benefits include learning by the&#13;
banking sector about long-term lending to the retail market, some local&#13;
employment generation, introducing competitive bidding procedures in the&#13;
selection of contractors, and potential development of new construction&#13;
methods and building materials. The experiences of this pilot project will&#13;
form the foundation for a larger program in the sector. Energy efficiency&#13;
rehabilitation of schools will have a demonstration and informational effect.&#13;
Also, through this pilot project, organizational, technical and financial&#13;
mechanisms will be tested that may work in other FSU countries as well.&#13;
Project Riskr:             Since this is the first pilot project in the sector supported by the Bank,&#13;
various quantifiable and non-quantifiable risks exist that may endanger&#13;
successful project implementation. Quantifiable risks relate to incentives: (a)&#13;
that the Government will not adjust heating tariffs and/or existing heating&#13;
subsidy programs appropriately, and hence make the cash flow of&#13;
investments not sufficiently attractive to individual households; (b) that&#13;
energy savings have been overestimated; (c) that the costs for the&#13;
rehabilitation measures rise significantly; and (d) that interest rates may raise&#13;
so as to deem the project-specific Government contribution unsustainable.&#13;
Given the severe Government budget constraints, it is unlikely, however, that&#13;
the Government would not adjust heating tariffs to full cost recovery,&#13;
similarly, heating subsidies would be expected to be directed to low income&#13;
households only. The relationship between market interest rate and the level&#13;
of the project-specific Government contribution will be reviewed semi-&#13;
annually and adjusted as necessary so as to maintain viability of the project.&#13;
Even in the worst case, sensitivity analysis has shown that economic rates of&#13;
return are unlikely to fall below 10%. Other risks, specifically related to the&#13;
institutional and behavioral environment within which the project will be&#13;
implemented are that: (a) the organizational capabilities of homeowners and&#13;
their associations are overestimated; (b) too few households will be able or&#13;
villing to participate; and; (c) homeowners' associations may not be able to&#13;
fulfill the role of borrowers and significant payment arrears will occur. To&#13;
mitigate these risks, a test and learning activity was undertaken as part of&#13;
project preparation with four homeowners' associations which provided valu-&#13;
able information for project design and for the design of a comprehensive as-&#13;
sistance package for homeowners and their associations. The scope of the&#13;
project has been kept relatively small which will facilitate implementation of&#13;
the technical assistance components. The risk of deficiencies in the enforce-&#13;
ment of loan repayments will be reduced through project eligibility criteria,&#13;
and by having the loans managed by commercial banks.&#13;
Public Participation:      Potential beneficiaries of the project were involved in its design through the&#13;
test program with four homeowners' associations (apartment buildings)&#13;
providing information regarding affordability aspects, perceptions and views&#13;
about their housing, and the need for assistance to their associations.&#13;
Continued participation is ensured by the project design under which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
homeowners, through their associations and assisted by consultants, will&#13;
themselves identify and determine the work to be undertaken in their&#13;
buildings, organize necessary decision-making processes, arrange for&#13;
financing, carry out the procurement of works, and participate in the&#13;
monitoring of energy efficiency impacts. The project coordination unit&#13;
(PCU) in the Housing Credit Foundation (HCF) will arrange for active&#13;
assistance to the beneficiaries, before-and-after-beneficiary assessments, and&#13;
launch public information programs based on the experiences of this pilot&#13;
project.&#13;
Environmental Aspects:     The project is expected to have a beneficial envirownental impact through&#13;
conservation of energy resources and a concomitant reduction in the by-&#13;
products of fuel combustion. Although these benefits are not expected to&#13;
be large, due to the limited resources available and the pilot nature of the&#13;
operation, a significant multiplier effect is to be expected in the medium&#13;
term. A project-specific risk mitigation procedure has been designed for&#13;
identification, handling and disposal of hazardous material that might be&#13;
encountered during renovation works. The project has been rated as&#13;
environmental screening category B.&#13;
Poverty Aspects:           Even though the project will have no direct impact in alleviating poverty,&#13;
credits provided through the project will be the only source of funds available&#13;
to low income households for energy efficiency rehabilitations. Rising energy&#13;
prices affect the poor particularly harshly and any savings will particularly&#13;
benefit them. A policy reform study will focus on a reorientation of existing&#13;
housing subsidies to provide greater benefit to neediest groups. The project&#13;
will also institute a tracking mechanism and closely monitor actual impact&#13;
and experiences.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return:   Overall economic rate of return of approximately 26%.&#13;

I.  SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
A.     THE COUNTRY AND ITS RECENT ECoNOMiC DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
1.1     When independence was regained, Lithuania inherited an economy that was relatively well&#13;
developed in comparison with other countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU). Since then, the&#13;
Government has been engaged in a massive effort to transform the centrally planned economy into a&#13;
market oriented economy. Substantial progress in the transition to a market economy has been&#13;
made, most notably in the areas of price     Box 1: Country Profie&#13;
reform, privatization and trade reform. After   Lithuania is the southernmost and largest Baltic country&#13;

1991 and 1993, real GDP turned around in     percent of its population of 3.7 million are of Lithuani-&#13;

by about 1.5 percent.' The decline in output   Vilnius. Lithuania lies on the eastern shore of the Baltic&#13;
has not led to a rapid increase in open      Sea and borders Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east,&#13;
unemployment; enterprises have relied        and Poland and Russia's Kaliningrad region to the&#13;
increasingly on unpaid leave and shorter     south. Lithuania has a variety of natural resources but&#13;
working hours. Real wages declined           no significant domestic source for its sizable fuel needs.&#13;
dramatically, although they have recently    The climate is cold, with a mean temperature of about&#13;
begun to recover. With the establishment of   0° Centigrade (32 degrees Fahrenheit) during a long&#13;
a currency board in April 1994, the national    heating season, lasting from mid October to mid April.&#13;
currency, the Litas, which was introduced in June/July 1993, has been fixed at an initially&#13;
undervalued exchange rate (1:4 to the US$). Inflation has slowed down over the past three years&#13;
(1 993: 410 %; 1994: 72 %; 1995: 39% 2) yet remains relatively high. Economic recovery continued&#13;
in 1995&#13;
1.2     Lithuania's economic reform program has been supported by two stand-by agreements&#13;
with the IMF (October 1992 and October 1993) and a US$ 60 million Rehabilitation Loan from the&#13;
Bank which became effective in October 1992. Bank projects amounting to US$ 160.5 million have&#13;
been approved for Lithuania, US$ 60.5 million of which have been disbursed.&#13;
B.     THE ENERGY AND HEAT1NG SECTOR IN LrTHUANIA&#13;
Energv Sector Background&#13;
1.3     Although poor in primary energy sources, Lithuania was chosen by Soviet planners as a&#13;
regional energy production center because of the country's high technical competence. The legacy&#13;
of this policy, in addition to a highly energy-intensive economy, is an energy industry with the&#13;
capacity to supply a region substantially larger than the country itself, yet with a nearly total&#13;
dependence on imported fuels and vulnerability to supply disruptions from the FSU. The sector is&#13;
further characterized by inefficient energy production and consumption, and high reliance on a&#13;
nuclear power generation plant. Import prices for gas and crude oil are negotiated between&#13;
suppliers and buyers, have been increasing dramatically, and are now close to world market levels.&#13;
I      The Lithuanian Government's published national accounts are recognized to underestimate GDP, as they do not&#13;
fully capture the rapidly growing private economy nor the parallel economy.&#13;
2      For 1993,1994 and 1995 (IMF). IMF projections are: 1996: 23%; 1997: 20%; 1998: 15%; 1999: 11%, 2000:&#13;
9%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
With the important exception of heating, energy prices in Lithuania generally reflect full cost&#13;
recovery. In the case of residential heating, it is estimated that about 60%-70% of the cost is&#13;
recovered from consumers.&#13;
1.4      Energy consumption in Lithuania includes a share of 20%  for space and domestic water&#13;
heating, which for urban households and commercial users is generated and delivered mostly by&#13;
district heating (DH) companies. The rather high share of energy consumption used for space&#13;
heating is attributable to inefficiencies on both the supply and demand sides of the system. Because&#13;
of overall district heating system inefficiencies, reductions in demand would theoretically permit&#13;
greatly reduced fuel consumption at central boilers. However, impediments in the supply system&#13;
must be overcome for this benefit to be fully realized. Inefficiencies on the supply side derive from&#13;
the organization of the energy sector in general as well as from technical problems with design,&#13;
installation, and operations and maintenance. While these are being addressed (see paras. 1.16 and&#13;
1.22) they are complemented by demand side activities such as this Energy Efficiency/Housing Pilot&#13;
project.&#13;
Residential Heating&#13;
1.5      The supply side for residential heating is characterized by a general reliance on inefficient&#13;
DH systems that are overwhelmingly - about 70% - based on heat-only boilers. The Lithuanian&#13;
Power Corporation (LPC)3 estimates that 60% to 80% of urban households are connected to the DH&#13;
systems. Others are on "block" and individual heating systems. As in most other Soviet-designed&#13;
systems, consumers in buildings connected to the DH system cannot control temperature and flow&#13;
into their respective buildings' sub-stations and the DH and block systems' design limit the&#13;
feasibility of metering consumption individually (per dwelling unit).&#13;
1.6      On the demand side, the thermal efficiency of housing is very low by European standards.&#13;
The most recent Soviet norms (1984-1987) permitted heat transmission values more than twice&#13;
those of Germany and Great Britain, and about five times those of Sweden for the same period.&#13;
Pre-1979 Soviet norms were considerably less demanding. In addition, detailed design and&#13;
installation of building assemblies could not always in practice meet the established norms, and&#13;
performance has continued to deteriorate over time because of poor or absent maintenance. The&#13;
result is a high energy intensity for space heating in Lithuanian residential buildings (in 1990,&#13;
roughly 200 KJ/sqm/degree-day, compared to 130 in the USA and 80 in Sweden). Seriously under-&#13;
heated apartments and wide thermal imbalances between different parts of the same building&#13;
threaten occupant health. According to a survey conducted in spring 1995, 43% of households&#13;
considered their apartments cold during the winter of 1994/95. One out of four households used&#13;
supplementary heating equipment to compensate for low temperatures provided by the district&#13;
heating networks (normally maximum 18° Centigrade, or 64 degrees Fahrenheit); electrical space&#13;
heaters are most popular. Rising subsidies to the district heating sector (2.4% of the national&#13;
budget in 1995) are putting increasing pressure on Government resources.&#13;
3      Production and distribution of electricity and heat is the responsibility of LPC which has a monopoly in the&#13;
energy sector in Lithuania. Until November 1995, LPC operated under the name Lithuanian State Power System (LSPS).&#13;
In an attempt to break up the inherited LPC monopoly in the energy sector following independence, the Government&#13;
separated the distribution and district heating companies from LPC. However, true financial separation was never&#13;
complete!y implemented and these activities were re-consolidated under LPC in the third quarter of 1993. Although LPC&#13;
is now a separate legal entity, its managerial and financial independence is limited as the MOE has explicit powers over&#13;
its operations, such as fixing its annual income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.7      Consumer Prices. Heating and hot water tariffs are established by the Energy Pricing&#13;
Committee and are based on a progressive system involving the floor area per apartment and the&#13;
number of persons in the household respectively. Recovery of heating costs from households is&#13;
currently estimated to be about 60%-70% of total costs. Further tariff increases are planned, with&#13;
the aim of raising revenues up to full cost recovery by 1997. Prices increased by more than 40% in&#13;
real terms in autumn 1995 (from 1.15 LT/sqm to 2.40 LT/sqm). As heat prices rise to meet&#13;
economic levels, the thermal inefficiency of Lithuanian buildings is creating affordability problems&#13;
for consumers. In 1994, an estimated 35,000 Lithuanian households (approximately 3.7% of all&#13;
households) failed to pay their heating bills. However, it is estimated that only one quarter of those&#13;
households could not afford to pay their bills, while others deliberately withheld payment for&#13;
'tactical' reasons (for more details, see Annex 1). In general, however, the payment performance&#13;
of private households appears to be relatively good. Arrears are mainly associated with the heating&#13;
season, as households generally pay their outstanding bills during the summer months. According&#13;
to a survey conducted in spring 1995, households dedicate, over one year, a rather high portion, on&#13;
average 11 %, of their monthly income to energy expenditures; in the winter this figure increases to&#13;
15%. In 1996, this portion of the monthly income is estimated to be about 17% and 23%&#13;
respectively, and expected to increase to about 22% and 27% respectively as the DH companies&#13;
move to full cost recovery in the near future.&#13;
1 .8     Potential for and interest in housing energy efficiency initiatives is large in Lithuania and&#13;
favored by the Govermnent's progressively conservative energy pricing policy. According to a&#13;
household survey conducted in spring 1995, public attitudes towards energy savings activities are&#13;
positive among the majority of urban households, largely irrespective of income or socio-economic&#13;
grouping (see Annex 1). Most households already engage in some kind of energy saving behavior.&#13;
They turn off the lights in unoccupied rooms (about 90% of the households) and perceive that&#13;
insulating their homes will reduce their energy bills (about 60% of the respondents). People both&#13;
believe that insulation would reduce their heating bill and would like to insulate their homes (about&#13;
75 % of surveyed households agreed with both statements). Yet, more than half of the respondents&#13;
did not know how to save energy or where they could get advice on energy saving matters. In&#13;
general, richer households appear to be better informed about energy savings possibilities.&#13;
However, larger insulation or energy efficiency rehabilitation measures - e.g. the rehabilitation of&#13;
an apartment building's heating system - appear unthinkable to most (see also. para. 1.13 below).&#13;
1.9      Subsidies for residential heating. The Government has established an indirect subsidy&#13;
program to reduce the burden of heat and hot water costs for needy households, subject to certain&#13;
eligibility criteria. Heat billings that exceed 15% of household income (and, in addition, hot water&#13;
billings that exceed 5% of household income) can be deducted from the bill and not paid; district&#13;
heating companies may claim reimbursement for the difference from the respective municipality (see&#13;
Anniex 2 for details of design and operation of the subsidy). Approximately 30% of urban&#13;
households are estimated to be eligible for this subsidy.4 While the heating subsidy has certain&#13;
advantages - it ensures the use of the implicit income transfer for the purpose it has been assigned&#13;
and the transaction costs involved in its administration are minimal - there are several serious flaws&#13;
4      According to a representative household survey conducted during spring 1995 about 8% of urban households&#13;
benefited from this program during the heating season 1994/1995. Official data on the number of households eligible for&#13;
the program during the heating season 1995/1996, when higher tariffs came into effect, are not yet available. Information&#13;
collected from the Vilnius DH company and the Vilnius municipality suggests that during October through December,&#13;
1995, more than 1/3 of all households in Vilnius were eligible for the subsidy and received, effectively, an average of 23&#13;
LT/month.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
in its design and operation: (a) it appears to benefit a population group much larger than that&#13;
comprising poor households, as municipalities have no means of verifying the correctness of income&#13;
statements on which eligibility depends; (b) it excludes most of the rural population - where poverty&#13;
indices are higher - as well as owners of single family homes since it only applies to dwellings&#13;
connected to the DH system or to local boilers that operate with metered natural gas; (c) it is&#13;
suspected that the district heating companies may in many cases not be able to claim reimbursement&#13;
from the municipalities and will have to absorb the cost of the subsidy themselves; and (d) as it&#13;
operates on a percentage basis it may remove, to some extent, the incentive for eligible households&#13;
to save energy. Irrespective of the subsidy, however, households are likely to be interested in&#13;
energy savings measures, given the unclear future of the heating subsidy itself and the use of&#13;
supplementary energy sources which are not eligible for the subsidy.&#13;
1.10     Technologies, materials and contracting for energy conservation. Practical farniliarity&#13;
with new energy conservation methods, materials and devices is embryonic in Lithuania but is&#13;
growing. Theoretical knowledge is substantial, however, and provides a good base for rapid&#13;
development of practical, marketable solutions. Engineering practice, developed under the Soviet&#13;
system where norms were prescriptive, needs some further development before it is comparable to&#13;
that of Western Europe, where architects and engineers are more used to meeting performance&#13;
specifications. Although new to the field, several local companies are eager to install energy-&#13;
related materials and devices. Foreign companies are beginning to be active and are seeking&#13;
partnerships with Lithuanian companies, and a large number of local agents for foreign building&#13;
materials are registered with Government. Local manufacturing of European and American&#13;
materials under license and assemblies is beginning, and some local enterprises are endeavoring to&#13;
compete by developing their own materials, at much lower prices. Several foreign suppliers are&#13;
training local companies in the selection and installation of their products. These private sector&#13;
activities are already beginning to change the approach to energy technology in Lithuania.&#13;
C.    THE HOUSING SECTOR IN LITHUANIA&#13;
1.11     Ownership and maintenance. Privatization of housing has been a very successful process&#13;
in Lithuania, but has created new responsibilities that homeowners have had difficulty meeting. By&#13;
1995, 87% of the total stock of dwellings had been transferred to private owners; in urban areas,&#13;
the share of private ownership exceeds 90%. Of these privatized dwellings, more than 80% are&#13;
apartments in multi-family buildings where the new ownership situation has created severe problems&#13;
for the organization of housing maintenance and improvements. Apartment owners now jointly&#13;
own and share responsibility for comnmon areas such as the basement, the central heating system,&#13;
the staircase, and the roof. Very little maintenance or improvement activities take place as neither&#13;
habit nor law obliges homeowners to take charge of their joint property. In the midst of low or&#13;
falling incomes, rising energy prices have directed the attention of many homeowners to residential&#13;
energy efficiency improvements in their apartments, such as simple window stripping or balcony&#13;
glazing.&#13;
1.12     Collective activities among homeowners (through building level homeowners'&#13;
associations) have become the only means for undertaking certain crucial improvements or larger&#13;
maintenance work in common areas of apartment buildings such as the renovation of the heating&#13;
system, or the repair of windows, staircases and roof. Indeed, homeowners' associations have,&#13;
since 1991, been formed in some buildings for the purpose of organizing small maintenance&#13;
activities (e.g. staircase cleaning) and repairs. While the general attitude towards homeowners'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
associations appears very positive, at present only about 10% of all homeowners are actually&#13;
organized in such associations. The majority of homeowners still relies solely on municipal housing&#13;
maintenance companies which only perform very limited services, corresponding to a small monthly&#13;
fee.&#13;
1.13     Major repair or maintenance work in apartment buildings is hardly ever undertaken at&#13;
the moment, not even where homeowners' associations are established and have taken over the&#13;
organization of housing maintenance. The reasons for this have to do with the legal framework&#13;
within which the associations operate and which, until recently, did not encourage maintenance; to&#13;
change this the Law on Homeowners' Associations was passed by parliament only in spring 1995&#13;
(see para. 1. 19 below). Also, and equally important, collectively planned building improvements -&#13;
in contrast to simple maintenance - still appear unthinkable to most homeowners. Detailed&#13;
beneficiary studies (see Annex 1) have shown that the reluctance to undertake such activities stems&#13;
from the fact that: (a) homeowners would need to learn to plan and undertake improvements by&#13;
themselves rather than rely on the municipality or some state agency, as they did for many years;&#13;
(b) homeowners in apartment buildings would have to organize collective decision-making within&#13;
the building, through their associations; and (c) the lack of reliable information on all aspects of&#13;
housing maintenance and financing, and the misunderstanding or misinterpretation of existing&#13;
information, have made many households risk-averse and hinders cooperation among them. In&#13;
addition, homeowners lack financial means and access to long-term financing to make such&#13;
improvements affordable and attractive.&#13;
1.14     Adequacy of the housing stock. Creating an appropriate framework for housing&#13;
improvements and maintenance in order to achieve greater energy efficiency and to set the right&#13;
incentives is crucial in the Lithuanian context since the housing stock is badly maintained to begin with&#13;
and limited in relation to the overall demand. Owing to poor maintenance or inadequate repairs, each&#13;
year more of the housing stock becomes unusable. The remaining housing stock is hardly sufficient for&#13;
the existing population. The average urban apartment is 53.4 sqm in area and is inhabited by 2.9&#13;
individuals. Often, two or more households share the same flat (for details, see Annex 1). New&#13;
construction activity has fallen dramatically (see para. I in Section B of Annex 3): prior to&#13;
independence, the construction industry in Lithuania included nearly 300 construction and assembly&#13;
firms that employed up to 12 percent of the nation's labor force and generated about 20% of total&#13;
GNP. By 1993, however, employment in the sector had dropped to less than 5% of the labor force&#13;
and the contribution to GNP had fallen to 7.4 %. Meanwhile, private funds are scarce and long term&#13;
credits for construction are unavailable, apart from limited Government programs.&#13;
I.15     Distortions in the housing market. Transactions in the slowly emerging rental and housing&#13;
market are still rare, and homeowners appear to have little sense of the economic value of their property.&#13;
Income differentials between the households within any particular apartment building are unusually high&#13;
as the housing allocation system during Soviet times functioned according to queues or wait lists rather&#13;
than price-determined demand. To date, residential mobility has been too limited to have created an&#13;
economically efficient allocation of housing, i.e. such that the quality and the size of an apartment or a&#13;
house corresponds to the preference or the income of the owner. While Government initiatives, assisted&#13;
by donor support (see para. 1.21), are slowly emerging, so far, the absence of an effective urban&#13;
cadastre and mortgage system have impeded interactions otherwise typical of a housing market, such as&#13;
active involvement of the banking sector, and the availability of funds for construction and home buying&#13;
or renovation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
D.    GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS&#13;
1.16     Strategy in the energy sector. The Ministry of Energy (MOE) is currently the primary&#13;
policy-making and regulatory body for the energy sector. Based on the National Energy Strategy&#13;
(July, 1993, by Government with EU Phare assistance), the Conference Communique on the&#13;
Restructuring of the Lithuania Energy Sector (November, 1993), the Bank's Energy Sector Review&#13;
(May, 1994), and the Public Investment Conference (May, 1995), the objectives agreed upon with&#13;
the Lithuanian authorites encompass: (a) security of energy supply through regional cooperation&#13;
and development of alternative indigenous sources; (b) economic sustainability of sector reform,&#13;
through private sector development and market discipline, cost recovery, and incentives for&#13;
conservation; and (c) energy efficiency and environmental protection, through improvement of&#13;
thermal energy efficiency and other measures.&#13;
1.17     Initiatives in residential heating. Complementing its supply side efforts, the&#13;
Government, through the Ministry of Energy, has recently begun to formulate a strategy for&#13;
improving energy efficiency on the demand side, and to draft policies directed specifically at&#13;
improving heating efficiency in housing. Initiatives include promotion of building-level heat meter&#13;
installations - with 80% of the equipment cost being subsidized by the Government - and&#13;
corresponding billing for heat according to actual consumption. Other incentives include discounts&#13;
on heating bills for upgrades of building-level heating equipment. It is estimated that about 50% of&#13;
Lithuania's urban households have installed building heat meters to date; anecdotal evidence&#13;
suggests that this has led to increased consumer awareness, and in some cases direct intervention by&#13;
building owners to reduce the flow from the DH system by controlling substation valves manually.&#13;
1I.18    Policies fostering private initiative in the housing sector. Following the early and extensive&#13;
privatization, the Government has taken a number of measures to foster private initiative in the sector.&#13;
The Homeowners' Association Law (see para 1. 19 below) is an important first step in this direction, as&#13;
was the establishment, in 1994, of the Credit Fund for Renovation and Insulation of Houses and&#13;
Apartments (CFRI) that was managed through an interministerial conimittee to allocate funds for the&#13;
support of energy efficiency and housing maintenance. The CFRI was recently reorganized as the&#13;
'Housing Credit Foundation' (HCF) and is currently the only source of long-term lending for such&#13;
activities in Lithuania. However, until July 1995, the Fund Decree required households to mortgage&#13;
their apartments when borrowing for residential rehabilitation. As a consequence, homeowners'&#13;
associations were not able to get access to these funds as it proved impossible for an association to&#13;
convince each and every homeowner in a building to mortgage his/her apartment. In order to make&#13;
lending for energy efficiency improvements feasible for homeowners' associations, the Fund Decree&#13;
was modified in August 1995 with respect to the requirement that borrowers mortgage their&#13;
property when taking a loan. Now, borrowing is possible without mortgaging, however at a higher&#13;
interest rate. For FY 1996, LT 16 million (representing 0.26% of the central Government budget) was&#13;
assigned to CFRI (now: HCF) in the national budget of which LT 6 million has been allocated to&#13;
support the construction and insulation industry. As part of this effort, the Ministry of Construction&#13;
and Urban Development (MCUD) is engaged in distributing information to private households&#13;
concerning the opportunities for residential energy efficiency improvements, including newspaper&#13;
articles, te;,vision programs, other publications, and seminars by foreign consultants in energy&#13;
efficiency technology, funded by bilateral donors.&#13;
I.19     The frameworkfor collective action in multi-family buildings. To correct the perceived&#13;
deficiencies of the privatization law with respect to building maintenance, the Parliament, in February&#13;
1995, adopted the Homeowners' Association Law (Bendrija Law). In May 1995 corresponding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
implementation regulations were passed. The law enshrines the homeowners' association (HOA) as the&#13;
single future institution to take care of housing maintenance and all management issues related to&#13;
common areas within multi-family buildings. The association is given the right to levy charges on all&#13;
homeowners in the building, be they members of the association or not, for the purpose of financing&#13;
maintenance and repair work agreed to by a majority of association members. In order to establish an&#13;
association, only 50% of the apartment owners in a building have to be present and come to a&#13;
majority decision (if the quorum is not obtained, only 25% have to be present at a meeting two&#13;
weeks later). Thereafter, decisions on building maintenance are taken at association meetings,&#13;
requiring a quorum of 50% of members (or 25% two weeks later) and a simple majority of those&#13;
present. Homeowners, whether or not they are members, have to settle all accounts with the&#13;
association before selling their apartmnent unless they are insolvent in wvhich case wvhen selling his/her&#13;
apartment, the accounts must be settled by the new owner. Whether or not membership in the&#13;
association is compulsory or automatic appears unclear in the law. However, according to the&#13;
Lithuanian Constitution, forced membership in an association is not permitted in Lithuania. MCUD&#13;
and MOF are investigating the relationship between the Bendrija Law and the Constitution in this&#13;
respect. At negotiations, it was agreed that a legal opinion would be provided to the Bank from a&#13;
lawyer in MOF or MCUD stating that, in their opinion, the HOA Law does not conflict with&#13;
Article 35 of the Constitution so as to adversely affect project implementation, and setting out the&#13;
legal arguments upon which this opinion is based. It was also agreed that, if necessary, the&#13;
eligibility criteria for participating HOAs could be amended, as required, or the Governrment could&#13;
raise the question before the Constitutional Court.&#13;
1.20     Policies fostering new construction. Since 1992, Lithuania has had a Government programn&#13;
of subsidized construction financing called "Bustas" (Housing) program which is a replacement of a&#13;
program that during FSU times provided long term loans for the establishment of housing cooperatives.&#13;
Loans are currently given at 8% interest rate (5% up to 1995), for 25 years, with 3 years of grace, to&#13;
cover 80%-90% of the investments. The program is expensive to society as it is covering the gap&#13;
between 8% (or lower) and the market interest rate which, for short-term loans, currently varies between&#13;
20% and 30%. In 1994, the total housing production in Lithuania was 8,000 dwellings, including 1,700&#13;
single family homes, of which 60% were financed through the "Bustas" program. The subsidies are&#13;
paid from the General Support Fund (Resolution 272 of April 19, 1993) formed from revenues from&#13;
privatization of housing, sale of land, sale of municipal dwelling premises, and sale of dwellings&#13;
belonging to enterprises and state funds. The budget impact of the "Bustas" program amounts to&#13;
approximately 3.4% of the state (central Government) budget. However, the Government intends to&#13;
reorient the scope and targeting of "Bustas". As of 1995, loans are only provided for the completion of&#13;
unfinished apartment buildings. In the future, the program may be re-oriented towards social housing.&#13;
The Energy Efficiency/Housing Pilot Project will address these issues through its Institutional&#13;
Strengthening component (see paras. 2.9 and 2.11).&#13;
1.21     Donor activities. EU Phare and several bilateral donors are actively encouraging energy&#13;
efficiency policies and programs in the housing sector. The Energy Agency in the Ministry of&#13;
Energy has opened an Energy Information Center in Vilnius, partly funded by EU Phare, to&#13;
disseminate information and provide advice on energy efficiency, and there are plans to establish an&#13;
energy fund for lending to industry for energy efficiency improvements at the end of 1996. The&#13;
German and Nordic Governments have financed renovation and insulation of a few apartment&#13;
buildings for demonstration purposes, and Denmark is considering support for residential energy&#13;
efficiency through export credits. MOE also works with EU Thermie in a program of information&#13;
dissemination. However, resources devoted to this program are limited. On the energy supply&#13;
side, local boilers have been upgraded in various municipalities with bilateral funding from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Denmark and Sweden. A land registration system is being developed with bilateral assistance from&#13;
Sweden. Surveying of the whole country is expected to be completed in five years. EU Phare and&#13;
USAID support Government efforts to improve the mortgage system.&#13;
E.    BANK STRATEGY AND EXPERIENCE&#13;
1.22     Bank strategy and projects. Restoring the immediate financial viability of the energy&#13;
sector, and achieving major efficiency gains through commercialization, institutional reform and,&#13;
where feasible, privatization, are the two principal objectives of Bank strategy in the energy sector,&#13;
as recommended in the Bank's Energy Sector Review (May, 1994), informally updated in May&#13;
1995. Up to now, Bank energy-related projects in preparation or underway have concentrated on&#13;
the supply side: the Power Rehabilitation Project (US$26.4 million, effective since November 1995,&#13;
for rehabilitation of the electricity system), the Klaipeda Geothermal Demonstration Project&#13;
(US$5.9 million Bank loan and US$6.9 GEF Grant, not yet effective, for demonstrating the&#13;
feasibility of developing Lithuanian geothermal resources in supplying heat to DH systems), and a&#13;
Heating Efficiency Project (scheduled for FY 1999, for rehabilitation of DH distribution systems in&#13;
selected cities, pending decentralization of DH companies). These supply-side projects focus on&#13;
rehabilitating parts of the existing thermal generation, electricity transmission and district heating&#13;
systems in order to increase the efficiency of energy use, among other objectives. Other Bank&#13;
projects in Lithuania include a recently completed US$60 million Rehabilitation Loan, a US$7&#13;
million Klaipeda Environment Loan, a US$25 million Enterprise &amp; Financial Sector Loan, a&#13;
US$6.2 Siauliai Environment Loan (not yet effective), and a US$30 Private Agriculture&#13;
Development Loan (not yet effective). Implementation experience to date is limited largely to the&#13;
Rehabilitation Loan.&#13;
1.23     Bank experience in the housing sector is limited in FSU countries. No Bank-financed&#13;
project focusing on affordable energy efficiency rehabilitation by homeowners has been implemented to&#13;
date in the sector. A proposed Russia Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project (Loan No. 4012) will&#13;
address energy efficiency in residential buildings divested from formerly public enterprises that have&#13;
been privatized or corporatized, but the apartments and houses are not owned by private households&#13;
in this case. Work on residential energy efficiency improvement has also been undertaken in the&#13;
preparation phase of a proposed Estonia Housing Finance Development Project. A Slovenia&#13;
Environment Project (Loan No. 8853) promotes lending to individual households to replace old&#13;
heating systems with more enviromnentally-friendly equipment. Here, environmental concerns were the&#13;
overriding reason for designing terms and conditions for final beneficiaries adequate to stimulate&#13;
demand. A significant number of bilaterally-financed pilot projects have been carried out in the Baltics&#13;
during the last few years, demonstrating energy efficiency measures that have payback periods of less&#13;
than 5 years and achieve energy savings in apartment buildings of more than 30%.&#13;
1.24    Generally, the Bank's experience shows that performance in the housing sector depends on&#13;
appropriate pricing, an enabling regulatory structure, and the early involvement of various stakeholders.&#13;
The Poland Housing Project (Loan No. 3499) highlighted the importance of appropriate&#13;
institutional, legal and banking arrangements. Bank studies in Russia and Hungary noted that, in&#13;
countries that have achieved reasonable economic stabilization (e.g. Lithuania), developing housing&#13;
markets provides significant benefits for the entire economy and helps to revive economic activity in a&#13;
decentralized fashion.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

F.     RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.25      A kev to addressing the most pressing problems in the housing sector in Lithuania in&#13;
general. and in residential energy consumption in particular, will be to encourage households to&#13;
actively assume greater responsibility for their dwellings. Offering homeowners access to credit.&#13;
adequate technical assistance and appropriate incentives can provide the initial learning experience&#13;
that is needed in order to encourage private initiative to assume responsibility for residential energy&#13;
efficiencv improvements and housing maintenance. It would complement the Bank's efforts to&#13;
sustain supply side policies as demand side energy efficiency improvements would ease the&#13;
implementation of supply side price adjustments. Fostering private initiative in order to improve&#13;
residential energy efficiency and, through this, housing maintenance and improvements, is an area&#13;
that has been neglected by other donors and investors due to the social issues mentioned above and&#13;
the conmplexitv of the necessary institutional reform. It appears therefore an appropriate niche for a&#13;
first Bank-financed pilot project in the housing sector.&#13;
1.26      Directly  or indirectly, this project addresses all four development priorities formulated in&#13;
the Country Assistance Strategy for Lithuania, as discussed by the Executive Directors during the&#13;
presentation of the Klaipeda Environment Project on December 8, 1994 (Bank Report No. 13677-&#13;
LT):&#13;
(a) Maintenance and development of physical infrastructure: Although housing represents only a&#13;
limitcd part of Lithuania's physical infrastructure, it has a very important social dimension that is&#13;
critical In transition economies Despite the sector's need for maintenance and development.&#13;
Governmcnt resources are hardly available. Thus, stimulating private initiative in housing will be&#13;
thc k-ey for improving it. While homeowners have no experience in assuming responsibility for&#13;
their d\eclhngs. thc opportunity to improve residential energy efficiency, and to save on their&#13;
cncrgn bill, w ll allow them to learn about, and change their attitudes towards, private initiative in&#13;
housing in genieral and the efficient use of energy in particular. Without intervention, this process&#13;
is likcl\ to be delayed and buildings will further deteriorate, making future investments in&#13;
maintenance and rchabilitation more costlv. Through public information activities that are part&#13;
of this projcct, the opportunity to learn about the tangible pay-off of private initiative in housing&#13;
w.-ill be given to an audience much larger than the direct beneficiaries and a critical demonstration&#13;
cffect \%ill havc been created.&#13;
(b) IReorientation ol/the energy sector to achieve greater energy efficiency: The project's demand&#13;
side orentation will complement the Bank's efforts to assist the GOL in reforming the supply&#13;
side (see para 1 22). Using a grass-roots approach, the project will raise awareness of the scope&#13;
for energy efficiency improvements, thereby increasing public support for improving efficiency in&#13;
the production units as well as in the distribution networks. Furthermore, stimulating demand&#13;
side energy efficiency improvements will facilitate the introduction of full cost-recovery, for&#13;
heating, which is an essential part of the policy reform needed in the energy sector.&#13;
(c) Incentives tbr private sector development. The proposed project will foster energy efficiency&#13;
activities on a small scale, the size of each credit being limited by a building's inhabitants' ability&#13;
to pay back a loan. As associations are expected to undertake investments suited to their&#13;
members' incomes, most rehabilitation measures will be relatively small. Small and medium&#13;
sized enterprises will gain access to a new set of customers as homeowners' associations get&#13;
access to funds for financing engineering and construction products and services. At the same&#13;
time, training activities undertaken and supported by the proposed project will reduce information&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
asymmetry and perceived risks of contracting in the markets for housing rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance, as well as energy efficiency engineering.&#13;
(d! Reform of the financial sector. Lending for residential energy efficiency improvements under the&#13;
proposed project will make use of qualified commercial banks. Banks interested in participating&#13;
in the project view their participation as an introduction to the concept of, and the practical issues&#13;
involved in, long-tern lending for housing in general, and in lending to homeowners' associations&#13;
in particular. As homeowners' associations are expected to become one of the major clients for&#13;
borrowing for housing rehabilitation, and given the degree of privatization in the housing sector,&#13;
the proposed project will support and speed up the financial sector's involvement in this sector.&#13;

II.  THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    PROJECT GENESIS&#13;
2. 1    The Government of Lithuania requested, in autumn of 1994, Bank assistance in the&#13;
preparation of a project addressing demand side energy efficiency issues and regards this project as a&#13;
priority. Project preparation was carried out jointly with the Ministry of Construction and Urban&#13;
Development (MCUD) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Other Government agencies, such as the&#13;
Ministry of Energy, District Heating companies and various municipalities were consulted. A social&#13;
assessment was undertaken, based on a survey of 2,000 households in spring 1995, also, a test activity&#13;
with four homeowners' associations was undertaken during summer and fall of 1995. Hearings and&#13;
meetings were held with homeowners and municipal officials in various cities. Discussions were held&#13;
with a number of institutions in the commercial banking sector. For demonstration purposes, energy&#13;
efficiency rehabilitations of schools were included in the project, and the municipalities of Vilnius and&#13;
Kaunas were selected due to their size, commitment to the objectives, and financial capacity.&#13;
B.    OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.2     This project is a pilot and demonstration effort that aims to: (i) support and enable private&#13;
initiative to improve residential energy efficiency; (ii) support public initiative in improving energy&#13;
efficiency in schools; and (iii) support the implementation of Government policies to sustain the&#13;
privatization of housing, enabling increased private initiative in housing maintenance in general. These&#13;
objectives will be achieved through:&#13;
(a) promoting and facilitating energy efficiency rehabilitation of residential buildings, by providing&#13;
loans for technically and economically attractive packages of measures which are affordable to a&#13;
broad range of citizens;&#13;
(b) promoting private initiative in housing and energy efficiency, by supporting the organization of&#13;
homeowners into functioning associations able to take charge of their buildings and housing&#13;
maintenance functions;&#13;
(c) supporting municipalities in the energy efficiency rehabilitation of schools for demonstration&#13;
purposes;&#13;
(d) developing the use of private energy consultants for housing retrofits; and&#13;
(e) introducing the commercial banking sector to the concept of long-term lending for housing and&#13;
housing improvements.&#13;
2.3     The project is a pilot effort since it is still unclear which institutional and financial&#13;
mechanisms and energy investments will prove to be most successful in achieving the aforementioned&#13;
objectives. Foremost, the willingness and ability of homeowners to take charge of their property needs&#13;
to be explored, including the specific needs for assistance, training, and public information. Secondly,&#13;
the functioning of homeowners' associations as viable partners in the housing market is as of yet&#13;
unknown. In particular, collateral and enforcement mechanisms that are involved in lending to&#13;
homeowners' associations need to be tested. Thirdly, and from a more technical point of view, the pilot&#13;
project is expected to demonstrate which energy efficiency improvements will generate the highest&#13;
savings under the specific Lithuanian conditions. Also, arrangements necessary for a credit facility for&#13;
long term lending to homeowners and their associations, administered through the commercial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
banking sector, will be tested. Testing the instruments and arrangements in these four areas, the pilot&#13;
would lay the foundation for potential future operations which would involve strengthening of., among&#13;
others, a housing finance system, property rights and land registration systems, housing&#13;
maintenance services, building codes, and the construction and building materials industries.&#13;
2.4     The project also is a demonstration effort since the changes in the behavior of homeowners&#13;
that will be required for successfully reforming the housing sector in Lithuania will have to involve an&#13;
extensive leaming process. Given the widespread mistrust towards available information, learning from&#13;
examples wvill be most effective. The project will generate such examples and thereby reliable&#13;
information about the experiences of those who have - on a trial basis - taken charge of their buildings&#13;
and implemented energy efficiency measures. Additional information on the amount of energy that can&#13;
be saved through rehabilitation measures will be generated through upgrading selected school buildings&#13;
and carefully monitoring energy consumption. The extent of the unclarities in the housing market, the&#13;
lack of reliable information on energy savings, and the significance of both for the behavior of&#13;
homeowners, were confirmed by a test activity that was undertaken during project preparation (see for&#13;
more details on the test activity, and the lessons learned, Annex I -B) .&#13;
C.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.5     The proposed project would consist of the following three components:&#13;
(a) credit for residential energy efficiency rehabilitation, with incentives for homeowners to&#13;
encourage participation;&#13;
(b) energy efficiency rehabilitation of schools in selected municipalities;&#13;
(c) institutional development and strengthening, to be achieved through technical assistance that will&#13;
(i) facilitate project implementation, including setting up advisory centers for homeowners and&#13;
homeowners' associations, and (ii) support further policy reform in demand side energy use and&#13;
the energy and housing sectors in general.&#13;
Component I: Residential Energry Efficiency Rehabilitation (US$ 15.4 million of which Bank loan&#13;
US$ 8.2 million)&#13;
2.6     The project will channel US$13.8 million (excluding borrower downpayments) through&#13;
commercial banks to approximately 200 - 300 homeowners' associations in multi-family dwellings,&#13;
corresponding to an estimated 14,000 homeowners, for residential energy efficiency improvements (e.g.&#13;
installation of new heating devices, rehabilitation of roofs and windows, and installation of additional&#13;
insulation). For demonstration purposes, single family homeowners will also be eligible as borrowers.&#13;
The share of investments in single family homes would, however, initially be limited to 10% of the&#13;
amount directed towards residential energy efficiency improvements. Individual apartment owners will&#13;
be eligible as borrowers only if the association in their building has taken a loan for rehabilitation of&#13;
common areas. Investments for which a loan can be taken will have to be directly related to energy&#13;
conservation. Repairs associated with the correction of urgent structural defects, such as deteriorating&#13;
roofs, will also be supported when related to energy savings measures. Investments are expected to be&#13;
of three types: (a) mechanical infrastructure (e.g. heating equipment, pipes); (b) minor&#13;
repair/refurbishing work such as window and door repair and tightening; and (c) major construction&#13;
works such as roof, external insulation and new windows. Investments per apartment building are&#13;
expected to range from US$20,000 to US$ 150,000. The range of expected cost per dwelling unit is&#13;
from US$ 100 to $3,000. Packages of eligible measures are expected to result in a reduction of energy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
consumption by up to 50%. (See Annex 3 for technical details, estimated savings and payback times).&#13;
They are of the type already undertaken in Lithuania and tested in Lithuania and elsewhere. Local&#13;
consultants and contractors will carry out most of the design and construction work with technical&#13;
assistance targeted at strengthening areas relating to energy efficiency analysis and design, as well as&#13;
competitive procurement and management of civil works. The allocation of project funds between the&#13;
three project components, as well as the portion allocated for single family homes, would be adjusted&#13;
during project implementation subject to agreement between the Government and the Bank. Eligibility&#13;
criteria for borrowers and investments (sub-projects) eligible for financing under the project were&#13;
discussed during negotiations and are included in Annex 7; they will also be referred to in the Operating&#13;
Procedures (OP). A condition for loan effectiveness is that final Operating Procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank have been adopted by the Government (see in para. 6.2(d)).&#13;
2.7     Incentivesfor homeowners to participate. Rising energy bills and the continuing decay of&#13;
residential buildings constitute an important incentive for homeowners to undertake rehabilitation of&#13;
their buildings, Yet, detailed beneficiary studies conclude that an incentive in the form of a transitional&#13;
Government contribution to the repayments of the loans will be required during the beginning of project&#13;
implementation. The surveys suggest that even though homeowners are very interested in energy&#13;
savings measures they have not yet engaged in such activities due to the substantial transaction costs&#13;
involved in organizing such collective actions, and the social learning cost of moving from a 50-year&#13;
tradition of relying on the Government to take care of housing. Mistrust and apprehension among&#13;
households concerning the reliability of available information, including information about the technical&#13;
and financial feasibility of solutions (i.e., energy savings to be expected from specific rehabilitation&#13;
measures), future energy costs, banking institutions, and borrower interest rates, increase their perceived&#13;
risk of such activities. While setting transparent financial incentives for homeowners and their&#13;
associations to engage in energy efficiency rehabilitation, these activities will have to be accompanied&#13;
bv a significant public information program (see para. 2.10(c)). Justification of the Government&#13;
contribution itself (described in para. 3.14; also see Annex 4), and its size, will be reconsidered semi-&#13;
annually during project implementation.&#13;
Component If: Energy Efficiency Rehabilitation of Schoolss (US$ 2.3 million of which Bank loan&#13;
US$ 1.8 million)&#13;
2 8     The project will channel US$2.3 million to selected municipalities (including contributions of&#13;
municipalities) for energy efficiency rehabilitation in 10-15 school buildings in those municipalities,&#13;
through onlending by the Ministry of Finance to the respective local governments. These investments&#13;
will be directly related to energy conservation, and may include related repairs to correct urgent&#13;
structural defects in the buildings, such as deteriorating roofs. Eligible measures are of the type already&#13;
tested in Lithuania and elsewhere. Local consultants and contractors will carry out most of the design&#13;
and construction work, with technical assistance targeted at strengthening areas relating to energy&#13;
efficiency analysis and design, as well as competitive procurement and management of civil works. The&#13;
average expected cost per building is $200,000 (see Annex 3 for technical details). The Municipalities&#13;
of Vilnius and Kaunas have been selected by the Government for this demonstration component because&#13;
of their size, willingness to support the project objectives, and their financial capacity.&#13;
5      Hospitals were also considered but were not included since this would have added implementation complexity to&#13;
the project (under central or district government jurisdiction).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Component III: Institutional Strengthening and Technical Assistance (US$ 2.9 million)&#13;
2.9     The project will provide an investment of US$2.9 million to support institutional development&#13;
in two areas and institutional strengthening in several others through specifically designed technical&#13;
assistance components (see Annex 5 for more details)'&#13;
(a) Organizational supportfor homeowners and homeowners 'associations may be provided&#13;
through advisory centers that will be established initially in two major cities (Vilnius, Kaunas).&#13;
Through these centers, homeowners and their associations will have access to organizational,&#13;
legal, financial and informational advice needed to form and operate functioning associations.&#13;
The centers will bc run and organized through local Associations of Homeowners 'Associations&#13;
(AHA) which are already in the process of being established, and which will be supported to&#13;
continue to do so through the provision of Technical Assistance. These centers will initially be&#13;
project-financed but will be set up so that they can evolve into self-supporting non-profit&#13;
organizations, based on membership contributions and fee-for-service arrangements.&#13;
(b) Technical and engineering advice will be provided to homeowners and their associations who&#13;
considler energy efficiency rehabilitation of their homes. Such advice will initially be available on&#13;
an ad-hoc basis and should later be arranged through advisory centers as described under (a).&#13;
The provision of adequate advice to homeowners and homeowners' associations, in&#13;
organizational and financial matters as well as concerning technical and engineering issues, will&#13;
be a dated covenant in the loan agreement, specifying that the Government will have to provide&#13;
evidence for the provision of such support by May 1, 1997 (see para. 6. I(e)).&#13;
2.10      Further institutional strengthening will be needed in order to: (a) support project&#13;
implementation, and (b) facilitate policy reform in key areas such as housing policy and the redirection&#13;
of housing subsidies to the needy (see para. 2.12). Activities to be financed for project implementation&#13;
include:&#13;
(a) technical monitoring of energy savings;&#13;
(b) before and after beneficiary assessment;&#13;
(c) public information programs regarding housing management and the merits of energy&#13;
efficiency/conservation, incorporating results and insights from (a) and (b);&#13;
(d) assistance to participating commercial banks regarding their evaluation of energy efficiency&#13;
rehabilitation proposals, and training in long-term lending for these and other interested banks;&#13;
(e) support of the local consulting, construction and building materials industries through training for&#13;
Lithuanian energy consultants (new technologies, new methodologies, relationships with&#13;
manufacturers, contractors, clients),&#13;
(f)  operational costs of the project implementation unit.&#13;
2.11     Policy studies. Recommendations for future Government assistance to the housing sector,&#13;
and an action plan to refocus and target the existing assistance to the neediest in society, will be&#13;
provided through detailed policy studies as part of technical assistance. These studies will address three&#13;
related policy areas: (a) Government assistance to the housing sector in general; (b) the existing&#13;
residential heating subsidy program; and (c) promotion of energy efficiency rehabilitation of residential&#13;
buildings. The three components may be undertaken as separate but coordinated studies. Finalizing&#13;
these studies is a dated covenant in the Loan Agreement, specifying October 1, 1997 as the completion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
date for components (a) and (b)(see para. 6.1(g)) and October 1, 1998 as completion date for&#13;
component (c) (see para. 6. 1(h)).&#13;
2.12      Study component (a) is expected to: (i) define the needs of different groups in the society in&#13;
terms of housing support and housing finance instruments, with particular emphasis on low income&#13;
households; (ii) assess the strengths and weaknesses of housing finance mechanisms in the private sector&#13;
and the corresponding prospects in the medium term; (iii) evaluate the existing Government subsidy and&#13;
assistance programs to the housing sector, in particular the "Bustas" program, in terms of impact on&#13;
beneficiaries and budgetary implications; (iv) define and evaluate different possible approaches for&#13;
Government to meet the needs of the poorest groups in the society regarding housing, taking into&#13;
consideration general social security policy and budgetary implications; (v) recommend appropriate&#13;
policies and strategies for Government assistance program(s) in the housing sector, with particular&#13;
emphasis on financial assistance programs and social housing; and (vi) define a detailed action plan for&#13;
the implementation of the recommended policy and strategies, including organizational, financial and&#13;
legal requirements, in particular a long-term action plan to redirect Government assistance in the&#13;
housing sector to the neediest in the society.&#13;
2.13      Study component (b) will include: (i) a review of the existing residential heating subsidy&#13;
program as heating tariffs increase, in particular its targeting, budgetary implications, and impact on&#13;
incentives for energy conservation; and (ii) formulation of recommendations for change. Through study&#13;
component (c) regarding residential energy efficiency, the consultant is expected to: (i) formulate&#13;
possible policies for a larger program for the promotion of energy efficiency rehabilitation, including&#13;
policies for institutional mechanisms; (ii) prepare a strategy for future Government assistance, if any,&#13;
for residential energy efficiency rehabilitation, and a strategy for the eventual phase out of the revolving&#13;
fund (RF) established under this project (see para. 3.16) and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU).&#13;
2.14      In addition, the participating municipalities will, with consulting assistance, each undertake a&#13;
study of their housing maintenance organizations with recommendations to be discussed and agreed with&#13;
the Bank, including options to reorient, reorganize, and/or privatize these maintenance operations.&#13;
Finalizing these studies will be a dated covenant in the Loan Agreement, specifying October 1, 1997 as&#13;
the completion date for the studies (see para. 6.1 (i)).&#13;

III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A.    PROJECT COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.1     Total project cost is estimated to be US$ 20.6 million equivalent, including applicable local&#13;
taxes and duties. The project costs are summarized in Table 3.1 (all estimates are in US dollar million&#13;
equivalcnts). Base costs are shown in September 1995 prices. As the loan would be considered a sector&#13;
or subsector loan, physical contingencies are not calculated. Price contingencies have been estimated&#13;
using Bank international inflation estimates which are as follows: 1996: 3.3%; 1997: 2.3%; 1998:&#13;
2.5%. 1998 -2001: 2.5% p.a..&#13;

B.    FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.2     A Bank loan of US$10.0 million will finance 49% of total project cost, or 81% of the foreign&#13;
costs and 23% of local costs. The loan will be repayable in 20 years including a 5 years grace period,&#13;
at standard LIBOR-based variable interest rate for US dollar single currency loans in annuity method.&#13;
The loan. US$ 10 million, will be onlent for the residential and school rehabilitation components of the&#13;
project. The loan will finance: (a) 53% of the residential rehabilitation component; and (b) 78% of the&#13;
school rehabilitation component. The loan is not expected to finance any institutional development and&#13;
technical assistance. Should grant financing from bilateral or other multilateral sources not be sufficient&#13;
for financing of the foreign costs of this component, Bank funds may be reallocated to the component,&#13;
as required. Government has been seeking grant financing for institutional development and technical&#13;
assistance but the specific sources of financing have yet to be confirmed (see Annex 5). Grant financing&#13;
of US$2.0 million has already been informally committed by the Governments of Denmark, Sweden and&#13;
the Netherlands (see Annex 5), and is therefore included as donor contribution. If and when additional&#13;
grant financing is forthcoming, the corresponding amount of Government financing will be reallocated&#13;
to the housing rehabilitation component. The financing plan is presented in Table 3.2.&#13;

3.3     Counterpart funds will be provided by the Government of Lithuania, participating&#13;
muricipalities, and private households. Private households will finance a minimum of 10% of the costs&#13;
of the housing rehabilitation component (US$ 1.6 million) in the form of downpayments for&#13;
rehabilitation work. In-kind contributions would be accepted as downpayment if they consist of goods&#13;
or works directly related to an investment proposal, e.g., drawings for building rehabilitation measures&#13;
paid for by the borrower not earlier than six months prior to presenting the proposal to a participating&#13;
bank. Municipalities will finance 20% of the costs of the school rehabilitation component (US$0 5&#13;
million). Government counterpart funds (US$6.5 million) represent an average of about US$1.6 million&#13;
per year over the project life of four years. All applicable taxes and duties related to the project Xwill bc&#13;
financed by counterpart funds. Total taxes are estimated to be US$3.5 million (18% VAT and 1 0%&#13;
customs duty on imported heating equipment and insulation material).&#13;
C.    ONLENDING ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.4     The Republic of Lithuania will be the Borrower. For onlending for the Residential&#13;
Rehabilitation Component, the Government will, with each commercial bank that will be a participating&#13;
financial institution (PFI), enter into an umbrella subsidiary loan agreement. This agreement wvill be&#13;
applicable to each individual sub-loan the banks then make under the credit line. The credit risk on sub-&#13;
loans to homeowners' associations would be borne by the Government, while the credit risk on sub-&#13;
loans to owners of single family homes and individual apartments, for which regular mortgage security&#13;
can be provided, would be borne by the onlending bank.&#13;
Onlending to Commercial Banks&#13;
3.5     The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will onlend Bank funds, together with the Government&#13;
counterpart contribution, to participating commercial banks in local currency, bearing the foreign&#13;
exchange risk, for three to ten years maturity at fixed rates (corresponding to approved sub-loans). As&#13;
an incentive for homeowners to participate, funds will be onlent, for the first six months of project&#13;
implementation, to commercial banks so as to keep the cost of borrowing for homeowners at a level&#13;
equivalent to an interest rate of 15% (consumer rate) (see paras. 3.14 and 3.15). The size of the&#13;
Government contribution to the program will depend on the difference between market interest rates and&#13;
the lower pilot consumer rate. While currently no reference market rates for long-term lending are&#13;
available, an approximation of market interest rates will be determined, in order to monitor the&#13;
Government contribution, every six months, and be defined as the average of the rates of Government&#13;
Treasury Bills, with the longest maturity available issued over the previous six months6, plus five&#13;
6      Mid-January 1996, the rate for one month T-bills was 26.7% while three month T-bills were sold at 28.5'.&#13;
Mid-May 1996, the average three month T-bill rate was 18.8%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
percent (market reference rate). Due to the differences in risk-bearing (see para. 3.4) funds will be&#13;
onlent to qualified commercial banks at the following rates: (a) for onlending to homeowners'&#13;
associations, the consumer rate (initially 15%); and (b) for onlending to owners of single family homes&#13;
and individual apartments, the consumer rate less a maximum spread to be agreed between the&#13;
Government and the banks, and approved by the Bank (initially the spread is expected to be 4%).&#13;
3.6     Ministry of Finance will make a provision out of counterpart funds for the amount of the&#13;
Government contribution, i.e. for the difference between the market reference rate and the consumer&#13;
rate. The difference between the market reference rate and the Government's cost of funds is expected&#13;
to cover administrative costs, Government contribution, credit risk, and a premium for foreign currency&#13;
risk. In order to ensure that final borrowers are aware of the level of Government contribution received&#13;
throughout the loan term, they will regularly be notified by the banks about: (a) the market reference&#13;
rate which would be applicable to the loan if no Government contribution was provided (the market&#13;
reference rate at the time of loan approval); and (b) the current market reference rate, i.e. the reference&#13;
rate applicable to new loans as of the date of notification. The Loan Agreement will contain a dated&#13;
covenant specifying that, based on market rates and borrower acceptance, Government will review, and&#13;
agree with the Bank on, the appropriateness of the formula for determining the onlending rate on or&#13;
before March 3 1, 1997, and semi-annually thereafter (see para. 6.1(d)).&#13;
Onlending to Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations&#13;
3.7     The banks will onlend funds in local currency to all final beneficiaries at the consumer rate.&#13;
For lending to homeowners' associations, banks would initially bear no credit risk and be paid a fee of&#13;
1% of disbursed funds, and 3% on collections of principal and interest, at the time funds are received.&#13;
This fee structure would correspond to a spread of about 0. 8% and is considered, based on discussions&#13;
with potential participating commercial banks, adequate incentive by these banks to participate in the&#13;
program. As securitv for lending to homeowners' associations, the banks (as collection agents) would&#13;
rely on provisions in the Homeowners' Association Law. The Subsidiary Loan Agreements will require&#13;
the banks, in cases of non-repayment, to pursue the available legal remedies so that the enforcement&#13;
procedures under the existing legal framework can be tested. They will, however, be reimbursed for&#13;
enforcement costs up to a predefined level. The banks would bear full credit risk for lending to owners&#13;
of single family homes and individual apartments, with the property as security, and charge a spread up&#13;
to an agreed level (see para. 3.5). The reflows from loan repayments may be used for additional&#13;
onlending by the Government to the banks as a revolving fund, after provisions for foreign currency risk&#13;
with respect to repayments to the Bank (see Annex 6). At annual reviews, participating commercial&#13;
banks will be given the option to switch to full or partial credit-risk bearing for lending to homeowners'&#13;
associations. Holding a mid-term review will be a dated covenant in the Loan Agreement (see para.&#13;
6.1(j)).&#13;
3.8     The onlending to homeowners' associations would rely on the existing provisions of the&#13;
Homeowners' Association Law. Under this law, an association has the right to levy charges on all its&#13;
members based on majority decisions taken by the association. In the case of default by a homeowner,&#13;
the association may avail itself of the remedies available under the Civil Code and the Civil Code&#13;
Procedures, i.e. the association can take a homeowner to court for foreclosure and eviction, if required.&#13;
Upon the bankruptcy of the owner of an apartment, the amounts owed to a homeowners' association are&#13;
by law transferred to a new owner upon the sale of an apartment, i.e. the unpaid debt obligation passes&#13;
with the property. The banks and the Government will be given, through the sub-loan agreements, a&#13;
contractual right of subrogation, i.e. in case of payment default the bank and the Government shall have&#13;
the right to assume the association's right to collect from its members and enforce its rights through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
courts. Lending to owners of single family homes and individual apartments for energy efficiency&#13;
rehabilitation will be undertaken with the borrowers mortgaging their interest in their property.&#13;
3.9     Homeowners' associations would be offered two optional loan instruments, a straight annuity&#13;
loan and an instrument designed with graduated payments. The latter would be more affordable for low&#13;
income households in apartment buildings as it would result in slight negative amortizations during the&#13;
first few years of loan repayment, i.e., slightly lower payments than the interest charged during these&#13;
years. The amortizations would be positive in real terms, however. The loans would be at fixed rate,&#13;
with a maturity of 3 to 10 years, paid monthly, and with no grace period. Borrowers would be required&#13;
to pay a minimum of 10% downpayment. For lending to owners of single family homes and individual&#13;
apartments, a straight annuity loan instrument would be applied. Signed Subsidiary Loan Agreement,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, between the Ministry of Finance and at least one commercial bank, will be a&#13;
condition for effectiveness (see para. 6.2(a)).&#13;
Onlending to Municipalities&#13;
3.10     For the School Rehabilitation Component, the Republic of Lithuania will, through the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, onlend funds to selected municipalities at the same terms as the Bank loan to the&#13;
Republic of Lithuania, i.e. twenty years maturity with five years of grace at standard LIBOR-based&#13;
variable interest rate in US dollars. The foreign exchange risk and the commitment fee on the loan from&#13;
the Bank will be borne by the municipalities. The reflows of loan repayments from the municipalities&#13;
will be used by the Republic of Lithuania to repay the loan to the Bank.&#13;
D.    COST RECOVERY, AFFORDABILITY, AND PRICING&#13;
3.11     Cost and cost recovery. The cost of the particular investments in an apartment building will&#13;
vary depending on the decision taken by each homeowners' association, based on its members' interest&#13;
in energy efficiency rehabilitation, on their household incomes, and on the rehabilitation needs in each&#13;
individual building. Costs and expected energy savings will vary significantly depending on size,&#13;
design, and condition of the particular building. Based on studies of a range of typical buildings and&#13;
test activities (see para. 2 in Annex 12), preliminary cost estimates for expected renovation packages&#13;
range from about LT 400 (US$ 100) per apartment for basic measures in large buildings, to about LT&#13;
12,000 (US$3,000) per apartment for comprehensive packages in smaller buildings. However, it is not&#13;
expected that more than LT 2,000 - 6,000 (US$500 - US$1,500) per apartment will be borrowed as the&#13;
homeowners' financial resources are limited and larger investment packages tend to result in&#13;
comparatively lower energy savings (see also Annex 12).7 For the school rehabilitation component,&#13;
projected debt service requirements are not expected to have a significant impact on the finances of the&#13;
participating municipalities. Loan repayments will start in the sixth year after loan effectiveness and&#13;
are estimated to be less than 0.2% of the 1995 budget expenditures in Vilnius and less than 0.3% in&#13;
Kaunas.&#13;
3.12     Cash-flow and affordability. The financial rates of return of all rehabilitation measures are&#13;
positive, assuming that heat tariffs will be adjusted to full cost-recovery by autumn 1997 (see para. 5.6&#13;
and Annex 12). Some investment packages with low initial cost and rapid payback time will generate&#13;
immediate positive cash-flows. In some other cases, however, investing in energy efficiency&#13;
rehabilitation may result in negative cash-flows in the beginning, as heating tariffs have not yet been&#13;
7      Typical renovation measures for energy efficiency improvements and their expected savings are discussed in&#13;
para. 5.4 and described in more detail in Annex 3 and Annex 12, together with estimated costs as of September 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
adjusted to a full cost recovery level.' This will be felt particularly in small buildings with high&#13;
investment needs and by the poorest households in such buildings. Affordability analysis assuming&#13;
investments ranging from LT 1200 (US$300) to LT 6400 (US$ 1,600) per apartment, with financing at&#13;
33% interest (example market rate), 10% downpayment, and graduated payments, indicates that low&#13;
income households (monthly incomes at about LT 430 or US$108 - estimated to be around the 10th&#13;
percentile) would, f.)r several investment packages, have to allocate more than 10% of their income to&#13;
monthly loan payments.9 Only for households with average income of over LT 1,000 or US$250 (30th&#13;
percentile and above) would loan payments for a typical investment package represent less than 5% of&#13;
their monthly income. Several measures and requirements will be applied in order to limit the risk of&#13;
unaffordable payments that may be asked of (poorer) homeowners by a majority in their homeowners'&#13;
association (see para. 4.10).&#13;
3.13      Consumer acceptance. Hearings and qualitative interviews with households willing to and&#13;
already engaged in collective activities for energy efficiency improvements indicated that interest rates&#13;
of, at maximum, 15% would be considered acceptable (see Annex 1-C). The reluctance to borrow at&#13;
any higher rate is due to serious psychological barriers among Lithuanian citizens that will have to be&#13;
overcome in order to engage homeowners' associations in borrowing for residential energy efficiency&#13;
improvements. These barriers arise from the social learning cost of moving from a 50 year tradition of&#13;
relying on the Government to take care of housing, from the view that the buildings are poorly built and&#13;
maintained due to Government neglect in the past, and from widespread mistrust and apprehension&#13;
among households conceming the correctness of available information, including information about the&#13;
technical and financial feasibility of solutions, future energy costs, and banking institutions. These&#13;
barriers are further aggravated by the substantial transaction costs involved in organizing collective&#13;
activities within homeowners' associations. Exposure to the Soviet system wherein official lending was&#13;
available at 5% interest, has made high interest rates unacceptable to many Lithuanians, regardless of&#13;
affordability.&#13;
3.14      Proposed Government contribution. In order to provide an incentive to homeowners to form&#13;
associations and to apply for loans for rehabilitation investments, the onlending arrangement involves a&#13;
Government contribution (see para. 3.5) in the form of an identifiable "matching grant" to the&#13;
borrowers' (homeowners' associations or individual homeowners) loan repayments. The size of this&#13;
contributions would be indicated in their loan statements issued by the bank. A monthly contribution or&#13;
grant is preferred over an "up-front" investment grant since it addresses the Government's contention&#13;
that the Government contribution and its precise amount should be evident to program beneficiaries&#13;
throughout the life of the loan. A general Government contribution is preferred over a means-tested one&#13;
due to the necessity of providing strong incentives for all homeowners to participate in the program.&#13;
The Government contribution would be funded from Government counterpart funds. A market lending&#13;
rate of 33 %, for example, would initially imply an overall Government contribution level of 44% of&#13;
market based loan repayments. As savings on heating bills are proven and borrower experience and&#13;
confidence improves, the Government contribution will be adjusted, depending on the market rate and&#13;
borrower acceptance. As inflation, and thus the market interest rate declines, the Government&#13;
8      Assuming that heating tariffs will be adjusted to full cost recovery by autumn 1997, all eligible investment&#13;
packages will result in positive financial rates of return (see Section 5 and Annex 12).&#13;
9      For low income households, the existing government subsidy program for residential heating may decrease the&#13;
incentive to undertake rehabilitation measures as they do not - or only partially - benefit from the induced savings (see&#13;
para 1.9 and Annex 2 for details of the operation of this subsidy program).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
contribution would be expected to decline over the life of the project.'° Semi-annual reviews of the level&#13;
of Government contribution, and thereby the effective cost/interest rate to borrowers, will be a dated&#13;
covenant in the Loan Agreement, specifying that the first such review would be held on or before March&#13;
31, 1997 (see para. 6. 1 (d)).&#13;
3.15      By providing a transitional Government contribution, the program will support the&#13;
Government's policy of energy conservation, and over time reduce the psychological barriers mentioned&#13;
above such that it can eventually be phased out. Since all Government counterpart funds will be part of&#13;
the existing annual budget allocation to the housing sector, this contribution will not be an addition to&#13;
but rather a reallocation of existing subsidies. In order to support a future consolidation and&#13;
reorientation of Government assistance programs in the sector in general, technical assistance will be&#13;
provided for a study of Government housing assistance programs. It will result in a specific action plan&#13;
to refocus and target this and other Government housing assistance programs towards the neediest in the&#13;
society (social housing) (see also para. 2.12). Finalizing this study will be a dated covenant in the Loan&#13;
Agreement, specifying October 1, 1997 as the completion date (see para. 6.1 (g)).&#13;
E.     FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS FOR A REVOLVING FUND&#13;
3.16      Under the proposed project, Government funds and the Bank loan would provide a total of&#13;
about US$13.8 million for energy efficiency rehabilitations of about 200-300 private apartment&#13;
buildings and some single family homes and individual apartments. In order to increase the impact of&#13;
this pilot project to meet a greater part of the projected financial needs for residential rehabilitation, the&#13;
lending for residential energy efficiency improvements will function as a revolving fund (RF) in local&#13;
currency. Funds will be channeled through commercial banks. Sources of funds include: (a)&#13;
disbursement of the Bank loan and Government contribution for the residential rehabilitations during the&#13;
project implementation period 1996-1999; and (b) reflow of loans which have shorter maturity than the&#13;
Bank loa.l. The funds generated would be used to finance: (a) the Government's loan repayment&#13;
contributions; (b) debt servicing of the full Bank loan including the portion used to finance RF and&#13;
project administration; (c) additional loans to support residential energy efficiency rehabilitation&#13;
projects; (d) credit and exchange gains/losses; and (e) institutional development and technical assistance&#13;
sub-components, as required.&#13;
3.17      Proforma projections of the RF and assumptions used for the projections are provided in&#13;
Annex 6. The model indicates that, if operated to the fullest extent, the RF would be financially&#13;
sustainabNe for about ten years. During this period, the revolving mechanism would allow the RF to&#13;
provide loans up to a total of about LT 128 million, or LT 68 million in 1995 terms, after servicing the&#13;
Bank loan over the full 20 year period, and providing all Government contributions to loan repayments&#13;
for loans given during the 10 year period. Project technical assistance will address policies for&#13;
Government's future involvement in the housing sector, which will include the development of a strategy&#13;
for redirecting or phasing out this RF (see para. 2.13). Developing such a strategy will be a dated&#13;
covenant in the Loan Agreement, specifying October 1, 1997 as the completion date for such strategy&#13;
(see para. 6.1 (g)).&#13;
'0     To ensure continuing clarity to the borrowers, the loan instrument and periodic payment documentation would&#13;
state the fixed market reference rate for the loan and the corresponding loan repayment amount, the Government&#13;
contribution, and the resulting net payment from the homeowners' association. Information would also be provided&#13;
regarding the current market reference rate and the level of Government contribution for new loans for comparison&#13;
purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.1     The institutions directly involved in implementing the project will be: (a) the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF), (b) the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that will be part of the Housing Credit&#13;
Foundation (HCF), a legal entity founded by the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development&#13;
(MCUD), (c) participating conmmercial banks, (d) participating municipalities, and (e) participating&#13;
homeowners' associations and individual home owners. The implementation arrangements are designed&#13;
to make best possible use of existing institutional capacity, provide for focused project implementation,&#13;
and be transitional in nature.&#13;
The Ministry of Finance&#13;
4.2     The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be responsible for onlending to participating commercial&#13;
banks for residential energy efficiency improvements, and to participating municipalities for school&#13;
rehabilitation. It will handle all disbursement transactions to commercial banks and municipalities (see&#13;
para. 4.34). MOF will appoint a part-time Disbursement Officer to handle the disbursements for&#13;
onlending to PFs and municipalities, and a full-time Implementation Officer for other project related&#13;
matters. Adequate staffing of these functions in MOF is a covenant in the Loan Agreement (see para.&#13;
6. 1 (a)). Government will enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with each participating bank and&#13;
municipality. Signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement acceptable to the Bank will be a condition for&#13;
disbursement to any participating commercial bank or municipality (see paras. 6.3(a) and 6.3(b)).&#13;
The Proiect Coordination Unit (PCU) in the Housing Credit Foundation (HCF)&#13;
4.3     Administration and coordination of the project, and implementation and coordination of the&#13;
institutional development and technical assistance component of the project, will be the responsibility of&#13;
a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCU will be a unit in the Housing Credit Foundation (HCF),&#13;
an independent non-profit legal entity that has recently been established by MCUD in order to&#13;
coordinate and administer loans and activities aimed at supporting energy efficiency rehabilitations.'"&#13;
The PCU within the HCF will engage solely in project implementation activities and not in direct&#13;
onlending. Financing for the new entity will be provided out of Government funds. MOF will enter into&#13;
an Implementation Agreement with the Foundation regarding the project implementation and&#13;
coordination activities to be performed. Signing of an Implementation Agreement acceptable to the&#13;
Bank will be a condition for loan effectiveness (see para. 6.2(c)).&#13;
4.4     Functions of the PCU The main functions of the PCU will be: (a) to manage and coordinate&#13;
the various TA components, in particular assistance and advice provided to homeowners, their&#13;
associations, and commercial banks, and thereby support and oversee project implementation; (b) to&#13;
identify funding for and contract out the services under the TA; (c) to produce consolidated management&#13;
accounts and reports to the Bank for the project, including the onlending activities on the basis of&#13;
information provided by MOF and participating commercial banks related to disbursement of sub-loans,&#13;
and on the basis of reports provided by TA consultants; (d) to advise and assist municipalities in the&#13;
procurement of works and services for the energy efficiency rehabilitation of schools, and ensure that&#13;
11     The Lithuanian word 'Fondas' can be translated either as 'Fund' or as 'Foundation'. As the entity founded by&#13;
MCUD has no lending or direct financing mission with respect to housing projects, to translate 'Fondas' as 'Foundation'&#13;
is considered more appropriate here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Bank guidelines are followed. (Procurement of works for residential rehabilitations will be undertaken&#13;
by the final borrowers, having access to technical advice). The PCU will provide a "ruling" on the&#13;
eligibility of particular loan applications presented to a participating commercial bank, should a bank&#13;
choose to submit such applications for interpretation due to uncertainty regarding their eligibility under&#13;
the project. The PCU will closely cooperate with MOF staff engaged in disbursing funds to commercial&#13;
banks and municipalities, as outlined in the Implementation Agreement. The PCU will further liaise&#13;
with involved Lithuanian institutions, ministries and donor agencies. Other MCUD units will continue&#13;
to perform certain information and consultation activities in the area of housing improvements,&#13;
supporting and compiementing the activities of the PCU, as appropnate.&#13;
4.5     Partners for Technical Assistance. Activities related to Institutional Strengthening, through&#13;
the provision of Technical Assistance as described in paras. 2.9, 2.10 and 2. 11, will be contracted out&#13;
and undertaken in close cooperation with relevant existing institutions and agencies. Support for&#13;
homeowners and homeowners' associations will be provided through existing Associations of&#13;
Homeowners' Associations, where appropriate. Advice on energy savings possibilities will be&#13;
coordinated with tl,e Energy Information Center of the Lithuanian Energy Agency in MOE. Assistance&#13;
to energy consultants and small contractors/construction firms will be organized in close cooperation&#13;
with MCUD and relevant associations. A training program regarding long term lending, particularly&#13;
lending to the housing sector, will be arranged through or in cooperation with an existing Bank Training&#13;
Institute within the Association of Commercial Banks (see Annex 5 for a summary of the various&#13;
technical assistance components).&#13;
4.6     Staffing and Organization of the PCU. The PCU will initially consist of a minimum of four&#13;
staff, including a manager, a TA coordinator, an implementation officer and an accounting/reporting&#13;
officer. Government has already appointed a PCU manager and a TA coordinator. The operating costs&#13;
of the PCU will be financed out of Government funds. MOF will exchange with the PCU periodic&#13;
management reports and account information for consolidated project reporting, as specified in the&#13;
Implementation Agreement. A project launch workshop will be held after the approval by the Bank's&#13;
Board, later in 1996. The workshop would combine training for the PCU staff with information for and&#13;
discussions with relevant stakeholders, as appropriate. Evidence satisfactory to the Bank that the PCU&#13;
is appropriately staffed is a condition for loan effectiveness (see para. 6.2 (b)).&#13;
4.7     The Board of the Foundation. According to Lithuanian legislation on non-profit legal&#13;
entities, the Housing Credit Foundation will have a Board. This Board will be chaired by a secretary of&#13;
MCUD and be composed of representatives of relevant Government mninistries (MOF, MCUD, MOE)&#13;
and other agencies with no potential conflict of interest. It is expected that this will ensure strong&#13;
interministerial coordination for the project, particularly between MOF, MCUD, MOE and Bank of&#13;
Lithuania. The Board will be responsible in particular for: (a) Government policy decisions related to&#13;
the project; and (b) coordination with other ministries regarding financing and promotion of residential&#13;
energy efficiency. The Board will replace the board of the Credit Fund for Renovation and&#13;
Rehabilitation (CFRI), the predecessor of the new legal entity that has functioned as an inter-ministerial&#13;
committee since 1994, under the authority of MOF (see para. 1.18). Quarterly meetings of the HCF&#13;
Board to review the implementation of the project is required as a covenant in the Loan Agreements (see&#13;
para. 6.1(1)). Prior to negotiations a modified draft Decree No. 1209, acceptable to the Bank, was&#13;
passcd by Government for the transfer of the previous Credit Fund for Rehabilitation and Insulation&#13;
(CFRI) to the Housing Credit Foundation (HCF).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Financial Intermediation (Commercial Banks)&#13;
4-8     The financial intermediaries will be eligible commercial banks. In order to limit the risk for&#13;
the Govcrnment, participating banks will be selected based on the same critcria as those uscd for the&#13;
Bank's financial sector operation in Lithuania, including having an acceptable audit report, providing a&#13;
Certificate of Compliance from the Bank of Lithuania (BOL), and comply ing with various financial&#13;
requirements (see Annex 7). Three Lithuanian banks are expected to be qualified according to these&#13;
criteria, two of them have. at this stage, agreed to bc financial intcrmediarics for the prolcct ThcN v i!l&#13;
play a key role in channeling loan funds, including project appraisal based on spccific cligibility criteria&#13;
and collection of payments from beneficiaries.&#13;
Participating Homeowners' Associations and Individual Homeowners&#13;
4.9      The main focus of the credit program will be lending to homeowners' associations Loans&#13;
may also be made to qualified oivners of single family homes as well as to individual apartment owners.&#13;
However, individual apartment owners would be eligible as borrowers only if the association in thcir&#13;
building would have taken a loan regarding common areas. Eligibility criteria for borrowers qualified to&#13;
apply for a loan, and criteria for eligible investments (sub-projects), are included as Annex 7. As this is&#13;
an entirely demand driven project, homeowners and homeowners' associations xwill have to come&#13;
forward themselves and apply for loans. The financing available for residential energy efficiency&#13;
rehabilitations (see Table 3.1 in Section 3) is expected to cover lending to an estimated number of 200-&#13;
300 homeovners associations, corresponding to about 14,000 apartmcnt owners. and additional ow\ners&#13;
of single famllv homes and apartments. Homeowners and homeowners associations will themselves be&#13;
responsible for implementing their respective investments, including procurement and supervision of&#13;
works, based on guidelines provided by the PCU. Advice and consulting services will be available&#13;
through advisory centers and other technical assistance arrangements (see para. 2 9).&#13;
4.10     Household incomes vary considerably within any particular building, and low-income&#13;
households are found in virtually all buildings. These households could be placed in a vulnerable&#13;
position if majoritv decisions in their association commit them to repayments that exceed their means&#13;
The following measures and requirements will be applied in order to limit the risk of unaffordable&#13;
payment demands: (a) careful assessment of the energy savings estimates of individual loan applications&#13;
by the banks, with the banks being provided access to technical expertise, as required, through projcct&#13;
technical assistance, (b) for loans resulting in monthly repayments which, added to the heating costs,&#13;
exceed the nation-wide standard heating tariff per m2, a requirement for a 2/3 majority in favor of the&#13;
loan at a general meeting of the homeowners' association; and (c) for loans resulting in monthly&#13;
repayments which, added to the heating cost, exceed twice the nation-wide standard heating tariff per m-&#13;
at the time of the decision, a requirement that all apartment owners (not just association members)&#13;
would have voted in favor of such a loan. In addition, homeowners' associations will be encouraged.&#13;
through the project infornation program, to take into account individual households' ability to pay in&#13;
deciding on investment amounts, and in allocating the proposed Government loan repayment&#13;
contribution among apartment owners. In order to enhance overall loan collectibility from homeowners'&#13;
associations additional requirements will be applied: (a) an up-front downpayment requirement from&#13;
the borrower of 10% of the investment amount; and (b) confirmed good payment record on the part of&#13;
the borrower for all utilities. Evidence satisfactory to the Bank, that Operating Procedures (including&#13;
eligibility criteria) acceptable to the Bank have been adopted is a condition for loan effectiveness (see&#13;
para. 6.2 (d)).&#13;
4.11     The generation and distribution of reliable inforrnation on the affordability of energy savings&#13;
investments will be an important part of the program. Therefore, all participating homeowners and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
homeowncrs' associations will be involved in an extensive monitoring program that encompasses&#13;
technical and financial aspects of the investments as well as social and organizational aspects of the&#13;
implementing energy savings measures through homeowners' associations. The results of the&#13;
monitoring activities will be made available to the general public through a wide-ranging public&#13;
information program. Further surveys will be conducted in order to assess changes in attitudes and&#13;
behavior of homeowners with respect to residential energy efficiency rehabilitations such that the&#13;
ongoing program (e.g. advice provided, Government contribution to loan repayment) can be adjusted&#13;
accordingly (see also paras. 4.21, 4.22, and 4.23).&#13;
4.12     During negotiations, the Government agreed to maintain policies and procedures adequate to&#13;
enable it to monitor and evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the carrying out of the project and the&#13;
achievement of its objectives (see para. 6.1 (c)). By June 1, 1998 (or one and a half year after loan&#13;
effectiveness) Government will undertake a comprehensive mid-tenn review of the project and refine the&#13;
design together with the Bank, as appropriate (see para. 6.1 (j)).&#13;
Participating Municipalities for Schools Component&#13;
4.13     Participating municipalities will initially be the municipalities of Vilnius and Kaunas. Each&#13;
municipality would implement their school rehabilitation program, estimated to comprise civil works on&#13;
three to eight schools per municipality depending on the size of the investments in individual buildings.&#13;
Implementation would be carried out through the existing organizational structure of the respective&#13;
municipality with assistance from the PCU.&#13;
Legal Arrangements&#13;
4.14     The onlending arrangements for the Residential Energy Efficiency Rehabilitation Component&#13;
would be documented as follows:&#13;
(a) The Government of Lithuania would, through the Ministry of Finance enter into Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreements, approved by the Bank, with participating commercial banks. The Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreements will, among other things, establish the use of funds and the eligibility criteria for end&#13;
borrowers, on-lending terms and conditions between the Government and the bank, terms and&#13;
conditions for onlending by the banks to end borrowers, arrangements for the project-specific&#13;
Government contribution, and loan effectiveness conditions. Signing of Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreements with at least one commercial bank, satisfactory to the Bank, will be a condition for&#13;
loan effectiveness (see para. 6.2(a)). Signing of additional subsidiary loan agreements will be a&#13;
condition of disbursement of funds for onlending to those banks (see para. 6.3(b)).&#13;
(b) Participating commercial banks would enter into Sub-loan Agreements with homeowners'&#13;
associations and individual home owners. The sub-loan agreements will, among other things,&#13;
establish the loan amount, the use of funds, and terms and conditions, including applicability and&#13;
arrangements for the Government contribution (see para. 3.14). Prior to negotiations,&#13;
Government submitted a draft model sub-loan agreement between banks and borrowers, to the&#13;
Bank for review.&#13;
4.15     The onlending arrangement for the Energy Efficiency Rehabilitation of schools would be as&#13;
follows: The Republic of Lithuania (Ministry of Finance) would enter into a Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement, approved by the Bank, with each participating municipality. The Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreements will establish, among other things, the loan anount for the municipality, the use of funds,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
on-lending terms and conditions, and loan effectiveness conditions, if any. Signing of the Subsidiary&#13;
Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, with a project municipality will be a condition of&#13;
disbursement for the funds to be on-lent to that municipality (see para. 6.3(a)).&#13;
4.16     The Republic of Lithuania (Ministry of Finance) would enter into an Implementation&#13;
Agreement, approved by he Bank, with the Housing Credit Foundation, which will establish, among&#13;
other things, project implementation and coordination responsibilities, use of project and donor funds for&#13;
technical assistance activities, and accounting and reporting requirements. Signing of the&#13;
Implementation Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, with the Housing Credit Foundation will be a&#13;
condition for loan effectiveness (see para. 6.2(c)).&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
4.17     The Borrower's project implementation plan (PIP) was discussed during negotiations. It&#13;
includes arrangements for the timely provision of all necessary inputs, adequate staffing of the PCU,&#13;
key activities and estimated time-table of implementation, technical assistance, implementation of&#13;
adequate financial management procedures, specification of the monitoring and evaluation system to be&#13;
applied, performance indicators and implementation of other operational procedures required for&#13;
effective project execution.&#13;
4.18     In addition to the PIP, the Borrower is defining Operating Procedures (OP) for the project&#13;
implementation activities containing more detailed guidelines to the PCU and other organizations&#13;
involved in implementing the agreements reached with the Government. Evidence satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, that Operating Procedures acceptable to the Bank have been adopted will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness (see para. 6.2(d)).&#13;
B.    SUPERVISION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.19     Project emphasis on monitoring and evaluation. As the project is a pilot, one of its&#13;
objectives is to draw lessons from implementation. This applies in particular to project areas that&#13;
involve: (a) reducing energy consumption through affordable rehabilitation packages; (b) promoting&#13;
self-management of apartment buildings regarding individual and group activities; (c) commercial banks&#13;
as financial intermediaries, and (d) subsidy and affordability aspects. Project monitoring will&#13;
systematically gather data that can be used to measure progress in meeting the project objectives and to&#13;
identify problems that impede progress. The monitoring programs will thus ultimately serve both the&#13;
ongoing monitoring needs of project management and the periodic stocktaking and evaluation needs of&#13;
various stakeholders to ensure replicability of the program. Performance indicators for technical and&#13;
social monitoring as well as project monitoring are described in Annex 8. Agreements were reached on&#13;
the performance indicators for all project objectives at negotiations (see para. 6. I(c)).&#13;
4.20      Technical monitoring and evaluation. The project will support a range of technical&#13;
interventions that will be chosen by the homeowners through their homeowners' associations. The&#13;
technologies of these energy-saving interventions is evolving and local capacity is expanding. This fluid&#13;
environment calls for careful monitoring of project inputs and impacts. Monitoring of technical aspects&#13;
will include: (i) energy consumption records for each building that is retrofitted, including baseline data,&#13;
and the costs to owners; (ii) perceived comfort improvements on the part of owners; (iii) technological&#13;
advances introduced or utilized; and (iv) progress in training consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
4.21      Social and institutional monitoring and evaluation. Social and institutional monitoring&#13;
during the implementation of the project will be more intense than normal project monitoring for several&#13;
reasons. First, the project offers the opportunity to learn and apply lessons quickly for the design of a&#13;
larger, nationwide program. Second, systematic social monitoring will provide a rich database for&#13;
impact evaluation and strong data for attribution. Finally, systematic social and institutional monitoring&#13;
will in itself constitute a powerful participatory mechanism. In particular, the beneficiary-focus of the&#13;
monitoring will provide a mirror through which other stakeholders can assess their performance in&#13;
meeting project objectives, identify areas to improve and specify ways to make the improvements, such&#13;
as procedural changes, pcrsonnel training, or other.&#13;
4.22      Project performance monitoring, supervision and evaluation. Project monitoring will be&#13;
the responsibility of the PCU, contracting out most of these functions, as appropriate. Separate studies&#13;
to monitor issues related to energy savings, affordability, construction/building material industry, etc&#13;
may also be commnissioned by the PCU. The PCU will furnish the Bank with reports on a regular basis&#13;
including: (i) quarterly progress and financial management reports (on a monthly basis upon request);&#13;
(iH) audited project accounts kept by the PCU and MOF, and audited annual financial statements of the&#13;
Housing Credit Foundation within six months after each financial year; and (iii) additional information&#13;
that the Bank may request from time to time. Audited financial statements of participating banks will&#13;
also be provided annually. Reporting requirements, and supervision schedule were confirmed at&#13;
negotiations (para. 6.1 (k)).&#13;
4.23      Performance will be monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis by the Bank. In addition,&#13;
the Government and the Bank will have annual reviews to exchange views on the status of project&#13;
implementation, particularly regarding: (a) the performance of participating banks, MOF, and the PCU&#13;
in project implementation procedures agreed with the Bank, and (b) adjustments in the project that may&#13;
be required to improve implementation of its objectives, including allocation of financing between the&#13;
project components. Indicators will track the progress of lending and physical works, the impact on&#13;
energy use and costs to the consumer, and experiences by project participants. Agreement was reached&#13;
at negotiations on annual reviews (para. 6.1 (f)) and on the performance indicators for all project&#13;
objectives (para. 6.1 (c) and Annex 8).&#13;
4.24      A mid-term review will be carried out about a year and a half after project effectiveness. A&#13;
thorough project evaluation will be undertaken at that stage to determine if project design,&#13;
implementation arrangements, or terms and conditions should be revised in order better to meet the&#13;
needs. In particular, evaluation will be performed regarding the effectiveness of the advisory services to&#13;
homeowners' associations and the performance of participating banks. Final project evaluation will be&#13;
undertaken after project completion.&#13;
4.25      As this is the first Bank-supported investment loan in the sector, and given the pilot&#13;
characteristics of the project, the project is expected to require a significant supervision effort.&#13;
Therefore, it is planned that about 25 staff weeks of effort for the first year and about 15 staff weeks in&#13;
each of the following three years would be required for supervision. A detailed supervision plan is&#13;
attached as Annex 9. The supervision schedule was confirmed at negotiations (see para. 6. 1 (k)).&#13;
C.   PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.26      Lithuania has a tradition of a capable construction industry. It is adjusting effectively to the&#13;
structural changes of economic transition and the resulting new market conditions by privatizing and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
downsizing. New small companies are entering the market to meet the demand for small-scale private&#13;
construction and renovation. Both local and imported materials are readily available in Lithuania, and&#13;
there are no restrictions on the import or use of foreign construction materials as long as they meet the&#13;
standards of the exporting country and Lithuanian environmental standards. Design and construction&#13;
professionals are readily available, and Government is promoting competitive bidding (for details on the&#13;
industry, see Annex 3). Because of the limited size of contracts and their geographical distribution, all&#13;
civil works under the project is expected to be undertaken by local contractors.&#13;
4.27     Since Lithuania does not have a long tradition of competitive bidding for procurement of&#13;
public goods and services, a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) is not required at this&#13;
stage. A Country Procurement Note (CPN) dated May, 1995, was prepared, which established that the&#13;
Government has started to introduce forms of competitive bidding.&#13;
4.28     Small works - procurement for residential energy efficiency rehabilitation. Procurement&#13;
for residential energy efficiency rehabilitation will be undertaken by the concerned homeowners'&#13;
associations and homeowners respectively up to an estimated amount of US$15.4 million. under sub-&#13;
loans provided by PFIs. The cost of civil works for individual contracts is expected to range from&#13;
approximately US$5,000 to US$150,000 with an estimated average of US$80,000 per expected&#13;
contract. They shall be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of written&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified contractors. Procurement advice provided by consultants in&#13;
advisory centers established under the project, will be available for sub-borrowers upon request. The&#13;
current list of contractors registered with MCUD will be provided to sub-borrowers. The project team&#13;
noted that the existing procedures for registration of contractors, which is performed on a continuing&#13;
basis, would be satisfactory for the requirements of the project. MCUD will periodically advertise in&#13;
local newspapers to seek applications from interested contractors. Contractors will be evaluated based&#13;
on criteria acceptable to the Bank, including experience, technical capability and financial capability. A&#13;
maximum contracting capacity of the contractors will be assigned by specialty, and continuously&#13;
monitored and updated. The Bank would review and give no objection to decisions to award contracts&#13;
regarding procurement by the first two homeowners' associations and the first two single family home&#13;
owners (sub-borrowers) for each participating bank. Although not envisaged for residential&#13;
rehabilitation, should there be any contracts valued at above US$250,000, these would also be subject&#13;
to prior review by the Bank. Further details on the procurement arrangements are included in Annex 11.&#13;
4.29     Civil works - procurement for energy efficiency rehabilitation of schools. Procurement of&#13;
civil works financed under the Bank loan for the schools in participating municipalities will be&#13;
undertaken by the coticemed municipality and in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;
The works will be procured under NCB on the basis of local advertisement. For contracts valued at less&#13;
than US$400,000, up to an aggregate of US$2.1 million (including counterpart funds), the Bank's&#13;
Regional NCB Samnple Bidding Documents for procurement of small works will be used, as&#13;
supplemented or modified with the approval of the Bank. Even though these contracts are small and&#13;
may not attract foreign bidders, foreign contractors will not be excluded from participation.&#13;
Procurement advice will be provided by staff in the PCU with procurement experience from previous&#13;
Bank operations. Works estimated to cost US$50,000 equivalent or less per contract up to an aggregate&#13;
amount estimated not to exceed US$500,000 will be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of written quotations obtained from three qualified contractors. There are no&#13;
contracts valued at above US$400,000 envisaged in this project. The prior review threshold for civil&#13;
works for rehabilitation of schools would be US$250,000 except that the Bank will review and give no&#13;
objection to decisions to award contracts for the first two contracts by each participating municipality.&#13;
All contracts above this prior review threshold will be subject to the Bank's prior review procedures.&#13;

N.B.F.: Not Bank-Financed. Bilateral grant and/or Government counterpart funds (US$2.9 million).&#13;
4.30       Procurement of technical assistance funded by parallel bilateral or other donor financing&#13;
will follow the donor's procurement procedures. Technical assistance is not expected to require&#13;
financing by the Bank. Should it become necessary for procurement of technical assistance or other&#13;
consultant services to be financed by the Bank, such procurement would follow the Bank's Guidelines&#13;
for Use of Consultants (August 1981). Such consulting services estimated not to exceed US$200,000&#13;
would be related to the rehabilitation of schools. All terms of reference regardless of contract value&#13;
would be subject to the Bank's prior review. In addition, prior review by the Bank will be required for&#13;
all consulting contracts with firms valued at US$100,000 and above, and all contracts with individuals&#13;
valued at US$50,000 or above.&#13;
4.31       The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4. 1  a detailed description is&#13;
provided in Annex 1 1. Implementation arrangements are explained in Section IV.A. Quarterly progress&#13;
reports will be submitted to the Bank as described in para. 4.22. A project launch workshop will be&#13;
held in September, 1996. Procurement arrangements were confirmed at negotiations (see para 6. 1 (k)).&#13;
D.      DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.32       Disbursenicnts will be administered by the Ministry of Finance, for onlending to commercial&#13;
banks, and to municipalities for rehabilitation of schools (see table 4.2 for Disbursement Categories).&#13;
Residential energy efficiency rehabilitation disbursements to suppliers of works or services to their bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
accounts in Lithuania or elsewhere would be made by the participating bank providing the loan, being&#13;
provided funds from MOF. Disbursements, for the energy efficiency rehabilitation of schools. to&#13;
suppliers of works or services to their bank accounts in Lithuania or elsewhere would be made by MOF&#13;
Disbursements to suppliers of technical assistance services would be made by the PCU, being provided&#13;
funds from MOF. Since the project seeks to encourage small and medium-size contractors for local&#13;
rehabilitation works, it is important that contractors and consultants be paid promptly for services&#13;
rendered.&#13;
4.33     Disbursements for civil works and consultant contracts will be made on the basis of certified&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) detailing the individual transactions, should the Borrower decide to&#13;
make disbursements to participating banks or pay certain contracts with Governnent funds before being&#13;
reimbursed from the Bank. The documentation to support these expenditures would be retained by&#13;
MOF for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last&#13;
disbursement was made. This documentation would be made available for review to auditors and the&#13;
Bank upon request. Full documentation would be required for withdrawal applications: (a) for ex-&#13;
penditures on civil works contracts over US$250,000; and (b) for consultant contracts, to consulting&#13;
firms above US$ 100,000, and to individual consultants above US$50,000. Minimum size of appli-&#13;
cations for payments directly from the loan account and issuance of special commitments would amount&#13;
to 20% of the authorized allocation to the Special Account, or US$160,000 (see. para. 4.35) All other&#13;
disbursements would be against full standard documentation as described in the World Bank's Dis-&#13;
bursement Handbook.. Disbursement arrangements were confirmed at negotiations (see para. 6. 1 (k)).&#13;

schedule shown in Arniex 10, and summarized below, over a period of four years. No standard&#13;
disbursement profile exists for energy or housing projects in Lithuania or in the region. The project is&#13;
expected to be completed by June 30, 2000 with a Closing Date of December 31, 2000. The Bank loan&#13;
of US$ 10.0 million is estimated to be disbursed as follows:&#13;

4.35     To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower may establish a Special Account (SA) in&#13;
US$ in a foreign commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's&#13;
share of expenditures. The Special Account would be managed by MOF. The Authorized Allocation&#13;
would be US$ 800,000, representing about four months of estimated average expenditures made&#13;
through the Special Account. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation to the Special&#13;
Account would be limited to US$ 400,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the loan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
have reached the level of US$ 1,000,000, the initial allocation may be increased up to the Authorized&#13;
Allocation of US$ 800,000 by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Applications for&#13;
replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has&#13;
been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow&#13;
the standard Bank procedure as described in Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank&#13;
statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all&#13;
replenishment requests.&#13;
E.    ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT&#13;
4.36     Accounting. The Borrower will be responsible for appropriate accounting and auditing of&#13;
the project, for reporting of the use of project funds, and for ensuring that audits of financial statements&#13;
and reports are submitted to the Bank. The PCU on behalf of the Borrower, and in collaboration with&#13;
the MOF, PFIs, and participating municipalities, will establish appropriate accounting systems to&#13;
provide information on the sources and uses of funds in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Project&#13;
accounts; including the Special Account, would be maintained according to international accounting&#13;
standards in four categories: (a) in the MOF, for the onlending to commercial banks; (b) in the MOF,&#13;
for the onlending to municipalities for rehabilitation of schools; (c) in the PCU, for consultant services&#13;
for institutional development and technical assistance, and for project operating expenditures; and (d) in&#13;
PFIs, for sub-loans with supporting procurement and disbursement documentation. The PCU will have&#13;
the overall responsibility for project coordination and consolidated project reporting. To ensure the&#13;
accountability for project funds, MOF, PCU, PFIs and participating municipalities will: (a) maintain&#13;
records of receipts and disbursement of all funds used for the project, (b) maintain internal controls to&#13;
ensure that receipts and payments are accurately recorded on a timely basis, and that assets and&#13;
liabilities are adequately controlled; (c) report on the use of funds; (d) facilitate verification of these&#13;
reports by independent auditors; and (e) provide all information, as required, to PCU for reporting&#13;
purposes. MOF will maintain documentation supporting disbursement requests made through SOEs.&#13;
MOF, PCU and participating municipalities will maintain accounts for project funds separately from&#13;
any other existing accounts. Participating commercial banks will maintain accounts for loans financed&#13;
by project funds separately from any other existing accounts.&#13;
4.37     Auditing. The PCU will also be responsible, on behalf of the Borrower, and in close&#13;
collaboration with the MOF, PFIs, and participating municipalities, for submitting to the Bank annual&#13;
audits no later than six months after the end of each financial year (Lithuania's financial year is January&#13;
I - December 31) of project accounts kept at the PCU, the MOF, and PFIs, as well as audited annual&#13;
financial statements of the Housing Credit Foundation with accompanied management letters with&#13;
recommendations. The audits will be performed by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
according to standards acceptable to the Bank, and under terms of reference also satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank. The audits would be carried out in accordance with intemational standards and be undertaken by&#13;
auditors qualified for the task. The audits will include the project accounts and related financial&#13;
management procedures, bank accounts, and a separate opinion on the SOEs and the SA. In addition,&#13;
audited financial statements of participating banks will also be provided annually to the Bank no later&#13;
than six months after the close of each financial year. The PFI audits will include a certification that the&#13;
bank continues tc be in compliance with the eligibility criteria for participation in the project.&#13;
Accounting and reporting arrangements were confirmed during negotiations (see para 6.1 (k)).&#13;

V.  ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A.     IMPACT ANALYSIS&#13;
5.1     The project will have a positive impact for the economy in general as well as for its most&#13;
direct beneficiaries. The economic analysis presented here distinguishes between quantifiable and non-&#13;
quantifiable benefits and then goes on to analyze risks associated with the project that may, at least in&#13;
part, prevent the expected benefits to emerge. The project's main benefits lie in its focus on&#13;
encouraging individuals and groups of citizens to assume responsibility for their housing assets,&#13;
something still very new in FSU countries. While these benefits are hard to quantify, the project's&#13;
quantifiable benefits are expected to be substantial as demonstrated in an economic rate of return of&#13;
approximately 26% (see para. 5.7).&#13;
Non-guantifiable Impact&#13;
5.2     The project's non-quantifiable benefits lie in its incentives and support for individuals to form&#13;
homeowners' associations and to participate in their activities. This is expected to improve and sustain&#13;
the privatization of housing and the citizens' approach and commitment to democratic decision-making&#13;
processes and organizations. Other non-quantifiable benefits from the project include: (a) support for&#13;
the reorientation of the energy sector through increasing consumer awareness and activity; (b) private&#13;
sector development as small and medium sized enterprises gain access to training and to a new set of&#13;
customers; and (c) extension of services in the financial sector (see also para. 1.26). It may also be&#13;
expected that there will be an impact on technological change, development and marketing of locally&#13;
produced building materials, mechanical equipment and insulation materials. Through the project,&#13;
organizational, technical and financial mechanisms for intervention in developing the housing market&#13;
will be tested and the experiences of this pilot project are expected to form the foundation for a larger&#13;
program in the sector.&#13;
Quantifiable Impact&#13;
5.3     The project's main quantifiable benefits consist of energy savings. While no other&#13;
quantifiable benefits have been evaluated for the analysis presented here these may derive from the&#13;
improvement in the building stock, increased comfort and health for the inhabitants, or environmental&#13;
improvements. Also, additional resource savings and reductions of homeowners' expenditure for heat&#13;
may result from a decreasing need for supplementary heating. About 16% of households in urban areas&#13;
are estimated to use additional heat systems, such as electric heaters, to complement the insufficient&#13;
temperatures provided by the DH system (see Annex I for a survey on consumer behavior and&#13;
attitudes). With better insulation households will no longer have to use these devices. The resulting&#13;
savings have not been evaluated, however, as the information on the frequency of the use of&#13;
supplementary heat is insufficient. In addition, homeowners will benefit from an increase in the value of&#13;
their apartment as a consequence of their investments. This increase would enter the calculation of the&#13;
financial rate of return as an additional benefit only as far as the increase is not derived from the lower&#13;
energy bill but from lower maintenance cost and reduced occurrence of leaks and other damage that may&#13;
arise due to insufficient heating and insulation.'2 Neither those nor other, tangible or intangible benefits,&#13;
have been quantified for the analysis below (for a summary of the evaluation of the savings, both for the&#13;
economy as a whole and for homeowners undertaking investmnents, see Tables 4 and 5 in Annex 12).&#13;
12     The quantification of the increase in value is difficult because real estate markets are only beginning to function&#13;
in Lithuania.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
5.4      Energy savings, for the economy as a whole, are evaluated as resource savings only, as they&#13;
occur in the reduction in the economy's consumption of natural gas, mazut and other fossil fuels that are&#13;
imported.3 For the individual homeowners who invest in energy efficiency measures, benefits are&#13;
evaluated through savings on their heating bill. As the project takes a program approach, the exact&#13;
extent and type of investments that will be financed cannot be determined ex ante. The analysis&#13;
presented here is based on technical assessments of a number of examples, 14 apartment buildings, one&#13;
single family home and one school (details of the analysis can by found in Annex 12). These examples&#13;
have been weighted according to their representativity for the Lithuanian housing stock. The economic&#13;
and financial returns have been calculated, based on these examples, using certain behavioral and&#13;
economic assumptions discussed below.&#13;
5.5      Assumptions concern foremost the choice and composition of energy efficiency measures. As&#13;
the objective of this project is to pilot, and better understand, the functioning of a demand-side program&#13;
that is based on private initiative, homeowners will not be required to undertake any specific measures,&#13;
e.g. only those measures that would affect heat consumption most14. Since homeowners' financial&#13;
resources arc limited, it is, however, assumed that all homeowners will opt for rehabilitation measures&#13;
that result at least in some energy savings. Thus, the 'packages' of investments that, for simplicity&#13;
reasons, form the basis for the analysis presented here, all contain temperature control valves as the&#13;
minimum measure necessary to achieve energy savings. Three 'packages' were assumed (A, B, and C)&#13;
combining various measures at varying cost and varying impact intensity on heat consumption (see&#13;
Tables I and 2 in Annex 12). In comparison to package A, packages B and C involve additional&#13;
rehabilitation measures with lower pay-offs in terms of energy savings. Such measures may be chosen&#13;
by homeowners and homeowners' associations for reasons other than only to save energy, e.g. the wish&#13;
or the necessity to improve and maintain the building envelope at the same time. Therefore, it is&#13;
assumed that, even though package A would result in the highest returns, only 60% of the buildings will&#13;
be rehabilitated with this package, 30% with package B, and 10% with package C (see also para. 5.15&#13;
below). As no particular measure will be mandatory, however, some homeowners in seriously&#13;
underheated buildings may still choose to invest in rehabilitation measures that would only raise indoor&#13;
temperatures and not save energy (e.g. only improving insulation, without installing temperature control&#13;
vaives). The effects of such choices on the calculated project returns are evaluated in the sensitivity&#13;
anialysis below.&#13;
5.6      Other assumptions concern the investments, in particular their amount and timing and the&#13;
prices of different measures. It is assumed that 6% of the investments will take place in year 1, 27% in&#13;
year 2, 32% in year 3, and 35% in year 4. The exact shares of foreign and local materials cannot be&#13;
determined ex ante. Most materials are now available in Lithuania, at lower prices than comparable&#13;
forcign materials. Prices of capital goods as well as heat tariffs are those of October 1995 (heating&#13;
season 1995/1996). While prices of capital goods are assumed constant in real terms, heat tariffs are&#13;
assumed to increase to reach full cost-recovery level before the heating season 1997/1998 and to be&#13;
constant in real terms thereafter.&#13;
13     Fuel savings resulting from investments under this project will not be large, since the total loan amount is&#13;
relatively small - corresponding to the pilot character of the project - and will result in energy efficiency rehabilitations for&#13;
relatively few buildings in Lithuania (approximately 250 apartment buildings and 12 schools).&#13;
14     Homeowners and their associations will be required, however, to install building-level heat-meters if these do&#13;
not exist already as otherwise monitoring of energy savings would not be possible and the project's intended&#13;
demonstration effect could not be achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
5.7       Quantifying energy savings, expected to arise under the stated assumptions, results for the&#13;
whole project in an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 25.9% and in a Financial Rate of Return (FRR)&#13;
of 3 1.2% (see Table 5. I).15 The economic rate of return is lower than the financial rate of return since&#13;
the economic evaluation does not take into account externalities and captures only savings in variable&#13;
fuel costs. Only in the long term, or with a considerably bigger investment, would savings in other&#13;
variable costs and in capital costs materialize (see para. 12, Annex 12). Taking into account such long-&#13;
term effects as well as the demonstration effect associated with the activities financed by the project,&#13;
and the associated externalities (see paras. 1.26 and 5.1), would further increase the calculated ERR.&#13;

* The assumptions for this Base Case are: Costs and energy savings according to technical assessments, heat tariffs to reach&#13;
full cost recovery level by the end of 1997, investment according to assumptions in Annex 12, paras. 1-3.&#13;
B.      PROJECT RISKS&#13;
5.8      Various quantifiable and non-quantifiable risks exist that may endanger successful project&#13;
implementation. Those risks, the likelihood of their occurrence, appropriate mitigation measures, and&#13;
an analysis of their impact on the expected project returns, are discussed below. Quantifiable risks&#13;
relate to incentives: (a) that the Government will not adjust energy prices and/or existing heating subsidy&#13;
programs appropriately, and hence make the cash flow of investments not sufficiently attractive to&#13;
individual households; (b) that energy savings have been overestimated; (c) that the costs for the&#13;
rehabilitation measures rise significantly; and (d) that interest rates may raise so as to deem the project-&#13;
specific Government contribution unsustainable. Other risks, specifically related to the institutional and&#13;
behavioral environment of project implementation are hard to quantify. These risks are: (a) the&#13;
organizational capabilitics of homeowners and their associations are overestimated, (b) too few&#13;
households will be able or willing to participate; and (c) within the given legal franework, homeowners'&#13;
associations may not be able to fulfill the role of borrowers and significant payment arrears will occur&#13;
(see para. 3.8).&#13;
Likelihood of Risks and Mitigation Measures&#13;
5.9      The likelihood of situations to occur that may risk project success, and appropriate mitigation&#13;
measures, vary substantially with the respective situation. For example, it is considered unlikely that,&#13;
given the current budget situation, the Government would not adjust energy prices appropriately and&#13;
increase heating prices to full cost recovery level. Ongoing Government discussions with the Bank,&#13;
is      The RRs for the complete investment component for apartment buildings were computed as a weighted average&#13;
of the RRs for the fourteen assessed buildings, assuming a distribution of 60:30:10 between packages A, B and C, and&#13;
weighted according to the building types' relative importance with respect to the overall urban structures (see Table 6 in&#13;
Annex 12 for the weightings which correspond to the prevalence of particular building types in urban areas in Lithuania).&#13;
The RRs calculated for investments in single family homes are generally much lower than those calculated for investments&#13;
in apartment buildings. For the calculation of the overall project RRs, the average RRs of the three investment&#13;
components (apartment buildings, single family homes, schools) were weighted according to the allocation of project&#13;
funds (see Table 3.1 in Section 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
concerning the possibi!ity of a Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL), and with the IMF, indicate a strong&#13;
political commitment to raising heating tariffs to full cost recovery.&#13;
5.10      The existing heating subsidy program, if not adjusted by the Government, may indeed&#13;
constitute a negative incentive for households, discouraging them from investments in residential energy&#13;
efficiencN rehabilitation, as it is tied to households' income and not to their expenditure for heating (see&#13;
Annex 2) However. households' expectations concerning the future of the subsidy and the development&#13;
of their ow%n income are likely to mitigate most of the effect of this negative incentive. Only about 10%&#13;
of households arc estimated to have no interest in investing in improvements as a result of the heating&#13;
subsidy. As the proposed project would provide financing only for about 200-300 buildings, the&#13;
negative incentive for this particular group is not likely to endanger overall successful project&#13;
implementation. Also, the project's institution building component entails the provision for a detailed&#13;
studv of Government policies in the sector that should lead to a redirection of the subsidy to low income&#13;
households only (see para 2.1 1).&#13;
5. I1     Dramatic changes in the market interest rate could deem the project-specific Government&#13;
contribution unsustainable. The Government contribution will be financed out of project funds; its size&#13;
is linked to the diffecrence between an initially fixed level of cost to the borrower (15%) and the average&#13;
of Government Treasury Bill rates'6 with the longest maturity available, issued over the previous six&#13;
months, plus five percent. If interest rates were to rise excessively, as could happen if the current,&#13;
difficult situation in the financial sector was not dealt with successfully, the project-specific Government&#13;
contribution would become more and more costly and the total amount needed to finance it would&#13;
increase Initially this would only shorten the lifetime of the Revolving Fund, as described in paras.&#13;
3.16 and 3.17. and the number of investments that can be undertaken would be more limited. While this&#13;
will not affect the calculated economic rate of return, higher than expected interest rates mav reach a&#13;
level at Nvhich the Government contribution in the form defined for the project (see para. 3.14) would&#13;
not be sustainable  In this case, the level of contribution would be reviewed with the Government and,&#13;
as appropriate, the effective cost of borrowing would be raised in accordance with changes in market&#13;
rates and inflation so as to maintain the project's viability to the economy as a whole.&#13;
5. 12     A test and learning activity was undertaken, as part of project preparation, in order to&#13;
mitigate implementation risks as they may emerge in relation to the organizational capabilities of&#13;
homeowners and their associations, their willingness to participate, and their ability to fulfill the role of&#13;
borrowers This tcst activity included assisting selected homeowners' associations through the&#13;
organizational, borrowing, and rehabilitation process involved in residential energy efficiency&#13;
rehabilitations. On the basis of this test program appropriate technical assistance components were&#13;
designed such as advisory centers and other support to homeowners' associations. As the scope of the&#13;
project has been kept relatively small, and the implementation arrangements are relatively simple,&#13;
technical assistance can be provided to address key issues with all relevant stakeholders (see Annex 5).&#13;
5.13      Amongst the implementation risks mentioned, the risk that homeowners associations will not&#13;
be able to fulfill the role of borrowers, and that consequently commercial banks will allow payment&#13;
arrears to occur, has in particular been considered carefully. Therefore, the project design gives&#13;
attention to reducing the risk of deficiencies in loan repayment by ensuring that: (a) households are&#13;
correctly advised not to undertake investments whose repayments exceed their means to repay; (b)&#13;
banks are able to correctly assess expected energy savings in loan applications presented to them, and&#13;
i6     Mid-January 1996, the rate for one month T-bills was 26.7% while three month T-bills were sold at 28.5%.&#13;
Mid-May 1996. the average three month T-bill rate was 18.8%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
(c) households are given positive incentives to continue repaying their loans. Technical assistance&#13;
provided to homeowners' associations will allow homeowners to develop informed decisions about the&#13;
most desirable investments, on the basis of careful assessments of cost and potential energy savings.&#13;
Eligibility requirements that link the size of an investment to the degree of consensus within any given&#13;
association will protect poorer households from being forced - possibly by richer neighbors - into&#13;
commitments that may exceed their means. Commercial banks will receive assistance for the appraisal&#13;
of loan applications in order to be able to correctly assess expected energy savings. As an indication of&#13;
homeowners' sincerity with respect to loan repayment, they will be required to provide themselves, up-&#13;
front, a downpayment arnounting to 10% of their total investment. A further indication will be provided&#13;
through the requirement that associations may not have outstanding utility arrears (see eligibility criteria&#13;
in Annex 7). The monthly Government contribution to households' loan repayments that will, for a&#13;
transitory period, as a 'matching grant' reduce the costs of the loan to the homeowners to an effective&#13;
interest rate of 15%, is expected to be an important positive incentive for continuing loan repayment. It&#13;
will be made visible to homeowners through their account statements which the association will be&#13;
required to distribute to all homeowners- Incentives/penalties through the heating billing mechanism are&#13;
not considered feasible or appropriate as the loans will be provided through commercial banks which,&#13;
for the enforcement of loan repayments, would have to rely on usual collection procedures in lending&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
5.14     The conditions under which commercial banks will act as Government's agents in the&#13;
onlending program are designed such that banks are not only obligated, by contract, to corroborate but&#13;
also have a financial interest in the timely collection of loan repayments. Part of the court cost to&#13;
commercial banks from initiating court procedures against a defaulting association will be reimbursed&#13;
out of project funds. It should be noted, however, that the payment performance among private&#13;
households with respect to heating bills appears to be relatively good. While the district heating&#13;
companies note high payment arrears during winter months, households usually pay their outstanding&#13;
bills during the summer months.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.15     The project risks taken into account in the sensitivity analysis include: (a) heat tariffs not&#13;
being adjusted by the Government to full cost recovery as assumed; (b) lower than expected energy&#13;
savings resulting from investments; and (c) higher than expected costs for labor and materials. Overall,&#13;
RRs generated by the project will remain well above the 15% level for most of the simulated changes in&#13;
parameters while the variations differ, depending on whether investments are undertaken in apartment&#13;
buildings, single family homes, or schools (for details of the sensitivity analysis, see Tables 8 and 9 in&#13;
Annex 12). If heat tariffs would continue to be set at a level at which cost recovery is only about 60%,&#13;
the FRR would fall from 31% to 18% while the ERR would remain unchanged. However, even at a&#13;
FRR of 18% most investments would still be attractive enough as to not endanger overall project&#13;
iniplementation.&#13;
5.16     While project returns will fall as a consequence of achieving less than expected energy&#13;
savings, the degree by which they fall will depend on the reason for which less savings were achieved.&#13;
Actual energy savings could be below the originally assumed level due to: (a) technical reasons (e.g.&#13;
particular building materials may not generate expected benefits); (b) more beneficiaries opting for&#13;
investment measures that affect heat consumption less (e.g. all beneficiaries might opt for package B);&#13;
or (c) beneficiaries opting to increase indoor temperatures rather than to reduce their energy&#13;
consumption. If, due to technical reasons, actual energy savings achieved were only 75% of what has&#13;
been originally assumed then project returns (ERR) would drop to 18%. If savings achieved were only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
50% of what has been assumed, project returns would drop to 10%. If more beneficiaries than&#13;
originally assumed were to decide to invest in rehabilitation measures with relatively lower payoffs,&#13;
including measures with a longer payback time, the rates of return would be reduced to 19% (package B&#13;
only). If only 75% of the originally assumed resource savings were achieved because beneficiaries&#13;
chose to use some of their investments for measures that do not generate any energy savings but only&#13;
increase their comfort, then project returns would drop, too. However, while any other such reduction&#13;
in savings would reduce the ERR to 18%, in this case this decrease would be less substantial, as raising&#13;
the comfort level would gencrate extra, additional economic benefits which are not included in this&#13;
figure. Such additional benefits from increasing homeowners' comfort level would result from the&#13;
substitution of supplemental heaters - as homeowners are able to raise indoor temperatures with heat&#13;
from the DH system and do not need the supplements any more - and from improvements in occupants'&#13;
health.&#13;

5. 17    An increase in costs for labor and materials does not affect the project's viability as much as&#13;
decreases in energy savings since (a) costs occur in initial periods only while savings are achieved over&#13;
the entire project life, and (b) each unit of cost generates several units of savings. A cost increase of&#13;
50% would decrease total project returns (ERR) from 26% to 15%, while the same percentage decrease&#13;
in savings would cause the ERR to drop from 26% to 10%.&#13;
C.    PARTICIPATION AND SUSTAINABILITY OF IMPACT&#13;
5.18     Project sustainability will crucially depend on various aspects of institutional reform and,&#13;
therefore, on the commitment of Government agencies and political decision makers to implement such&#13;
reforms. Commitment on the Government's side to the project is strong at present. MCUD and MOF&#13;
have been involved extensively in project preparation, demonstrating a high level of project ownership.&#13;
5.19     Project sustainability is also supported through the participatory approach taken by various&#13;
project preparation activities and by the project design. Direct beneficiaries of the project were involved&#13;
in project preparation during a 1995 test program which influenced project design, in particular as&#13;
regards affordability aspects and the need for assistance to homeowners' associations (see Annex l-B).&#13;
Continued direct participation is ensured since the homeowners, through their associations, will&#13;
themselves identify and determine the work to be undertaken in their buildings, develop the necessary&#13;
decision making processes, arrange for financing, carry out the procurement of works, and participate in&#13;
the monitoring of energy efficiency impacts. The PCU will arrange for active assistance to the&#13;
beneficiaries, monitor closely progress and impact, and launch public information programs based on&#13;
the experiences gained during this pilot project.&#13;
D.    DISTRIBUTION OF IMPACT&#13;
5.20     Individuals and groups positively affected by the project. The project will have a direct&#13;
positive impact on the living standards of those approximately 14,000 households that live in buildings&#13;
in which energy efficiency improvements are expected to be implemented. These households will enjoy&#13;
lower energy bills, a better and healthier indoor environment as well as improvements in the value of&#13;
their assets. At the same time, they will learn about issues involved in privately organized and&#13;
implemented housing maintenance, an experience that should enable them to function more effectively&#13;
as the housing market develops. In the medium term, an indeterminate number of households will&#13;
likewise benefit from being informed about the experiences of the project and will be in a better position&#13;
to avail themselves of long term funds that by then may be available from other public or private&#13;
sources. Other 'winners' will include contractors and consultants benefiting from contracts generated&#13;
through the project as well as from training provided through the technical assistance program. As&#13;
approximately 90% of Lithuanian households own their houses or apartments, largely irrespective of&#13;
income groups, no socio-economic group will be excluded from these medium-term benefits; however,&#13;
affordability may pose a constraint for the poorest households to participate.&#13;
5.21     Individuals or institutions who may be adversely affected by the project include (a) those&#13;
individuals in apartment buildings who may, over time, relocate because they cannot afford the loan&#13;
repayments determnined by a majority in their homeowners' association, or because they do not want to&#13;
pay them; and (b) the district heating companies that will lose some revenues, though to a very limited&#13;
extent. In the former case, homeowners may have to sell their apartments and move to buildings where&#13;
monthly charges are lower. In the latter case, the effect is likely to provide a positive incentive for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
DH companies to operate more effectively and to improve the efficiency of production and delivery of&#13;
heat.&#13;
E.    FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
5.22     Counterpart funds required from the Government for the proposed project are about US$6.5&#13;
million over the four year project implementation period. This would be a redirection of existing budget&#13;
resources for the housing sector. The annual Government contributions to the project represent less&#13;
than 0.3% of the 1996 Central Government budget.&#13;
5.23     Contriblitions from the Government and proceeds of the Bank loan for the rehabilitation of&#13;
residential housing totaling about US$13.8 million will be set up as a revolving fund. Proforma&#13;
projections indicate that the Fund would provide loans totaling about LT 128 Million or LT 68 Million&#13;
in 1995 terms, over a ten year period, after deduction of all debt service of the Bank loan and&#13;
Government contributions matching loan re-payments by final borrowers (see Annex 6).&#13;
F.    POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
5.24     The project will have no direct impact on the poor as a group, however, credits provided&#13;
through the project will be the only source of funds available to low income households for&#13;
improving the thernial efficiency of their homes. Rising energy prices affect the poor particularly&#13;
harshly and any savings are the more to their benefit. Affordability analysis shows that low&#13;
monthly repayments are achievable to most households by limiting renovation measures to the ones&#13;
with high payback, financed by medium to long term loans being shared with many other&#13;
households. In order to ensure that the project will in particular benefit homeowners in apartment&#13;
buildings, the share of the Bank loan that can be used for lending to individual homeowners (of&#13;
apartments or single family homes) will initially be restricted to 10%. To limit the risk of&#13;
unreasonable payment demands being inflicted on low income households through majority decision&#13;
by the homeowners' association in their building, various mitigation measures would be applied&#13;
(see para 4.10). In addition, homeowners' associations will be encouraged to take into account&#13;
individual households' ability to pay in allocating the proposed government loan repayment&#13;
contribution among apartment owners.&#13;
5.25     Some of the poor households among those eligible for the Governments' heating subsidy&#13;
program may be negatively affected by their homeowners' association's decision to invest in energy&#13;
efficiency rehabilitation. While these households may not benefit from any energy savings achieved&#13;
through an investment - under the heating subsidy program they do not pay any heat billing exceeding&#13;
15% of their income - they will still have to bear the cost for the investment. Quantitative and&#13;
qualitative analysis suggests, however, that only a very limited number of households may be in a&#13;
position in which modest investments in energy efficiency may inflict additional hardship (see Annex 2,&#13;
para. 9). Indeed, a test-activity undertaken as part of project preparation demonstrated that keeping an&#13;
investment small will result in loan repayments which are affordable even to the very poor (see Annex&#13;
1-B, para. 12). The project will institute a tracking mechanism and closely monitor actual impact&#13;
and experiences. Policy reform features of the project - i.e. financial assistance for specialized&#13;
stu'dies leading to specific action programs - will, among other things, encourage a reorientation of&#13;
existing housing subsidies to provide greater benefit to neediest groups.&#13;
&#13;

G.     ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
5.26      The project is expected to have a beneficial environmental impact through conservation of&#13;
energy resources and a concomitant reduction in the byproducts of fuel combustion. Although these&#13;
environmental benefits are not expected to be large due to the limited resources available and the pilot&#13;
nature of the operation, a significant multiplier effect is to be expected in the medium term. The modi-&#13;
fications of existing buildings are not expected to require, during the implementation of the works, re-&#13;
location of residents. All investments would have to comply fully and be consistent with Government&#13;
and Bank environmental policies and conditions. The project environrental review concluded that the&#13;
Bank's and the Government's primary concern would be asbestos that may be encountered in the form&#13;
of pipe insulation in older buildings for which the following mitigation plan has been designed.&#13;
5.27      A two-step environmental risk mitigation procedure would be applied for each sub-project,&#13;
as required, to address asbestos pipe insulation encountered in rehabilitation works financed under the&#13;
project, namely (a) identification, and (b) handling and disposal. Identification of asbestos will be&#13;
effected through a process whereby the sub-borrowers' consultants will be required to certify the&#13;
absence or presence of asbestos in each sub-project. Local inspectors from the State Labor Inspectorate&#13;
would be available to support the consultants when there is doubt.'7 Handling and disposal: Where&#13;
asbestos is certified to be present, the respective contractor will be required, as per specifications in the&#13;
civil works contract with the sub-borrower, to submit a plan for handling and disposal of the asbestos."8&#13;
Existing asbestos removal procedures used by Lithuanian district heating companies (adopted in 199 1)&#13;
have been reviewed and found to be adequate to meet mitigation requirements for handling and disposal.&#13;
The contractor's plan must be approved by the sub-borrower. Guidance will be provided by the State&#13;
Labor Inspectorate or the Municipal Center for Public Health, as required. Lithuanian national norms&#13;
and Public Health and Occupational Safety and Health procedures for asbestos handling are being&#13;
developed by a Government task force, and are expected to be established by 1997.&#13;
5.28      The consulting assistance to sub-borrowers for preparation of sub-project investment&#13;
proposals, which would include identification of hazardous material and any other environmental&#13;
concems, would be funded by the project technical assistance component through bilateral grants&#13;
exceeding US$0.5 million. Potential environmental concerns will also be addressed in training&#13;
programs for these consultants (see para. 2.1 0(e)). Assurances would be sought from Government to&#13;
ensure TA quality and corresponding fallback financing, should sufficient grant financing not be&#13;
forthcoming. Potential issues identified would be addressed by the civil works contractor, and would&#13;
consequently be paid for through such contracts. The project would be coordinated with demand side&#13;
energy conservation programs of the Lithuanian Energy Agency and related activities financed by the&#13;
EU. The project has been rated as environmental screening category B (for further details, see Annex&#13;
13).&#13;
11     In case a sub-borrower would choose not to use the consulting services made available under the project, the&#13;
participating bank appraising such loan application will be required to undertake the corresponding environmental&#13;
investigation by a consultant also made available under the project.&#13;
is     A corresponding procedure would also apply should any other hazardous material or environmental concerns be&#13;
identified related to the residential rehabilitations by the sub-borrower or the consultant.&#13;

- 43 -                                Annex I&#13;
1.  SOCIAL ASSESSMEENT&#13;
1.  A social assessment was conducted to ascertain the level of demand for the project, to&#13;
determine likely impact on beneficiaries, and to understand the roles, responsibilities, strengths and&#13;
weaknesses of various project stakeholders. The social assessment consisted of two major&#13;
activities: (a) a survey of 2007 households, conducted in Vilnius, the capital city, and Kaunas, the&#13;
second largest city in Lithuania, investigating energy consumption patterns, living standards,&#13;
attitudes towards housing and maintenance, and the organizational capacities of homeowners'&#13;
associations; and (b) a test-activity launched by MCUD involving assistance to four homeowners'&#13;
associations in buildings where energy efficiency improvements were considered and planned and&#13;
where implementation was initiated, supported by qualitative interviews of households and&#13;
homeowners' association leaders and by systematic participant observation by a team of social-&#13;
scientists.&#13;
A. HOUSEHOLD ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ATTITUDE&#13;
Survey Design&#13;
1.  Field work for the survey was carried out from January to May 1995, strategically focusing on&#13;
two cities, Vilnius and Kaunas. About 607 buildings were involved; 2007 interviews were&#13;
conducted; and 94 homeowners' associations were visited. Interviews were conducted using a&#13;
questionnaire especially designed for this task. Random sampling was applied to the sample frame&#13;
of the household survey. The building-strata resulted from cross-combinations of: (i) three&#13;
construction periods (before 1957, 1958-1983, and after 1984); (ii) six types of building materials&#13;
(brick, concrete, panel, karkas, wood, and other); and (iii) seven height categories (individual&#13;
houses, 1-2 storey apartment buildings, 3-4 storey, 5-8 story, 9-11 storey, 12-15 storey, and 16&#13;
storey apartment buildings).&#13;
Housing and Privatization&#13;
2.  The large majority of the households live in apartment-buildings (85%) or in multi-family&#13;
houses (5 %). Only 5% of the households live in single-family houses, although this figure rises to&#13;
9% in Kaunas against 2% in Vilnius. Due to insufficient housing, 6% of the households surveyed&#13;
live in communal dwclliigs (or dormitories) where they share the kitchen and the bathroom with&#13;
other households.&#13;
3.  Ninety-four percent of the households surveyed reported to own their home. The incidence of&#13;
home ownership amongst pensioners is particularly high (97%). Even families living in dormitories&#13;
received privatization vouchers and now most of them own their room(s). Residential mobility has&#13;
grown as a consequence of the privatization program. While a third of the households have been&#13;
living in the same home for the last 20 years, one household out of two has been living in the same&#13;
home for the last 10 years, and one household out of four has moved home in the last five years.&#13;
Amongst pensioners, however, more than 56% have lived in their home for more than 20 years and&#13;
nearly 80% for more than 10 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -                                Annex 1&#13;
Energy Use and Energy Efficiency Rehabilitation&#13;
4.  About 95% of the homes are heated with a central heating system. Either the central heating&#13;
system is connected to a district heating network (92% of homes) or the building operates its own&#13;
boiler (8% of the homes). Individual boilers are mostly found in individual houses and 1-2 floor&#13;
apartment buildings. Three out of four households entirely depend on central heating and do not&#13;
use an additional heating system. Electricity is widely used for supplementary heat by the&#13;
remaining 25 %. Additional heat is almost exclusively used to cope with a deficient main heating&#13;
system, either where the level of heat is insufficient (for 48% of the households during the heating&#13;
season) or when the collective central heating system is shut down (happens to 46% of the&#13;
households during the heating season, and to 92% outside the heating season). Pensioners are&#13;
much less likely to use supplementary heat (12%), and only 8% use electrical heaters for this&#13;
purpose.&#13;
5.  Although half of the households are satisfied with the heating system and enjoy a comfortable&#13;
heat level (51 %), quite a large number of households considered their apartment cold during the&#13;
winter 1994/1995 (43%). Households connected to a central heating system are much more likely&#13;
to be dissatisfied with their heating system than households connected to piped gas (20% of the&#13;
households connected to a central heating system are very satisfied with the heating system, while&#13;
this opinion is voiced by 55.5% of households which use piped gas for heating). Approximately&#13;
one quarter of all households express strong discontent regarding their heating system.&#13;
6.  People own their apartments, but few have yet carried out major repair work to improve the&#13;
thermal resistance of either the building or their own apartment. It is common for households to&#13;
carry out temporary winter insulation work, such as window insulation with plastic film (about 75 %&#13;
of the households) or door insulation (about 50%). Balcony glazing is very popular, and one&#13;
household out of four who has a balcony has glazed it in the last five years. Major work, such as&#13;
renovation of the heating system, is unthinkable for the majority of the people due to the involved&#13;
cost.&#13;
Household Incomes and Expenditure for Energy&#13;
7.  The data support the commonly held belief that in Lithuania, as in many other Eastern&#13;
European countries, income groups are randomly scattered across apartment buildings, irrespective&#13;
of an apartment buildings' quality. Also, the data do not show any significant relationship between&#13;
a household's income and the state of the heating system in the household's building.&#13;
8.  On an annual basis, households devote on average 1 1 % of their monthly income to energy&#13;
expenditure (electricity, heating, hot water, gas, etc.); in the winter this figure raises to 15%.&#13;
Network fuels represent 90% of the energy bill. Although the energy bill increases with income,&#13;
the financial burden is not distributed with equity among households. Low income households bear&#13;
a relatively higher burden than any other income groups. Energy bills absorb at least 20% of their&#13;
monthly income and up to 26% during the winter months. Meanwhile, for the high income&#13;
households the energy bill never exceeds 22% of their income during the winter month, and drops&#13;
to a maximum of 15% on an annual basis.&#13;
9.  On average, due to their higher energy consumption, households living in individual houses&#13;
spend more to meet their energy requirements than their counterparts living in apartment buildings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -                                 Annex I&#13;
The former pay, on average, 60% more than the latter. People living in brick houses have a&#13;
particular high energy bill. The smaller the building, in general, the higher the energy bill per sqm.&#13;
10.  Although a large majority of consumers admit that they have financial problems to pay their&#13;
energy bills (73%) only half of them agree that they would consume less if prices were higher.&#13;
More generally, they say that it will be impossible to pay more (87%). However, the statement that&#13;
'it would be impossible to pay if prices were higher' should be interpreted with caution as it is&#13;
supported also by about half of the respondents in the highest income quartile for whom the heating&#13;
bill does not regularly exceed 2% of their income. The social program aimed at providing financial&#13;
support to low-income families is perceived as inefficient by almost 90% of the households.&#13;
Indeed, nearly 60% of households in the lowest income quartile admit having financial problems&#13;
paying their energy bills, among pensioners the share of households expressing this opinion rises to&#13;
80%.&#13;
Attitudes towards and Knowledge about Energy Saving&#13;
11.  There are mixed opinions about energy savings actions. Fifty-five percent of the households&#13;
do not agree that 'energy saving is a waste of time' (the rest agrees or has no opinion). Most&#13;
people think that they would reduce their energy bill if they could save energy. On the other hand,&#13;
80% of al; surveyed households estimate that their energy consumption has already reached a&#13;
minimal level, and that a reduction in the level of consumption would inflict a hardship on their&#13;
families. Interestingly enough, the attitude that reducing the energy consumption would be a&#13;
hardship is most widespread amongst households who are content with their heating systems (a&#13;
result which suggests that answers provided to the question whether saving energy would be a&#13;
hardship should be interpreted with caution). Also, households who admit having 'financial&#13;
problems paying their heating bills' are more likely than other households to state their wish for a&#13;
home heat meter (on average this is stated by half the respondents). This appears to imply that as&#13;
households feel the burden of their energy bill they would try to save energy, in order to save on&#13;
their bill; nonetheless they may not find themselves in a comfortable situation as a result (since they&#13;
consider themselves already having reached a minimal level). Pensioners, on the other hand, are&#13;
the group least likely to express a wish for a home heat meter even though the share of respondents&#13;
amongst pensioners who expressed wanting to have one is still close to 50%.&#13;
12.  About half of the respondents did not know how to save energy or where they could get&#13;
advice on energy saving issues. However, not knowing how to go about it does not appear to&#13;
imply a negative attitude towards energy savings in general. Setting up an information center or a&#13;
building demonstration project was seen as somewhat useful (14% and 15%), although people think&#13;
that television is the best medium for conveying information about insulation issues (48%). In&#13;
general, richer households tend to be better informed about how to save energy (67% in the lowest&#13;
quartile said they did not know how to save energy, while this was stated by only 45 % in highest&#13;
quartile).&#13;
13.  Most households do engage in some kinds of energy saving behavior. They turn off the&#13;
lights in unoccupied rooms (about 90% of the households) and perceive that insulating their homes&#13;
will reduce their energy bills (about 60%). Nevertheless, there is a general feeling of&#13;
powerlessness as higher energy prices are perceived as a "bad fate".&#13;
14.  People both believe that insulation would reduce their heating bill and would like to insulate&#13;
their homes (about 75 % of surveyed households agreed with both statements). Indeed, more than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -                                Annex 1&#13;
40% of the respondents had indeed spent more than 15 LT over the last year on insulating their&#13;
home, e.g. through windowstripping, glazing, etc. Households appear to invest less in insulation if&#13;
they are convinced that there is no way they can regulate the heat level in their apartment or&#13;
building. The interest in insulating one's home is most prevalent amongst those who either own&#13;
their apartments/houses or belong to co-operatives even though the interest is also very strong&#13;
amongst households living on premises that belong to the municipality or a private landlord (about&#13;
65%).&#13;
15.  Insulating one's home appears to be less interesting, however, for households occupying&#13;
large apartments or houses, nonetheless occupants of larger flats and houses appear better informed&#13;
about energy savings possibilities. Consequently, there does not seem to be a relationship between&#13;
whether a household is well informed about insulation and whether it would like to insulate its&#13;
home. It should be noted that the interest in insulating one's home only varies slightly amongst&#13;
income groups in general (72% in lower income groups and 78% in higher income groups).&#13;
However, 'having problems paying one's bill' is a statement that appears strongly related to the&#13;
wish to insulate one's home.&#13;
Attitudes towards Homeowners' Associations&#13;
16.  More than half of all households strongly believe that a homeowners' association would be&#13;
useful, a statement with which only 7% 'strongly disagree'. Attitudes towards the importance of&#13;
homeowners' associations appear to be only slightly influenced by the level of education and by&#13;
income. While 54% of household heads that are university level graduates agreed that 'an&#13;
association would be useful', this opinion was only shared by 49% of household heads with only&#13;
elementary school education and by 37% of household heads with uncompleted secondary&#13;
education. Gender or age appear not to influence attitudes towards associations.&#13;
17.  Homeowners' associations were reported to exist in the buildings of 12% of the surveyed&#13;
households. The incidence of associations is highest amongst households living in apartments&#13;
owned by a private landlord and amongst households owning their homes (less so in municipal&#13;
owned houses). In nearly all cases where a homeowners' association exists, housing maintenance is&#13;
also organized by the association. Homeowners in buildings with an association appear to be better&#13;
informed than on average about energy savings and have more positive attitudes towards energy&#13;
savings activities.&#13;
B. RESULTS OF A TEST ACTIVITY&#13;
Motivation for the Test Activity&#13;
1.  MCUD launched a test activity during project preparation in order to understand the needs and&#13;
capabilities of homeowners associations, particularly within the context of improving energy efficiency&#13;
in their buildings. The purpose of the activity was to learn about homeowners associations by enabling&#13;
selected associations to undertake more substantive energy efficiency improvements. MCUD staff,&#13;
working with local and international consultants, helped four associations go through a process through&#13;
which they would borrow money from banks to implement energy efficiency measures. MCUD staff&#13;
and technical consultants provided direct assistance to the associations through the many steps in the&#13;
process, including: (i) inviting the associations to take the loan; (ii) obtaining a mandate from&#13;
association members, (iii) gathering technical and procedural information; (iv) preparing a proposal that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -                                  Annex I&#13;
identified options and their respective costs and benefits; (v) choosing a course of action and inviting&#13;
bids from contractors; (vi) selecting a bid; (vii) negotiating with contractors; (viii) negotiating with&#13;
commercial banks; and (ix) overseeing the construction and installation. Meanwhile, social scientists&#13;
and field assistants closely observed the process, complemented by two phases of qualitative&#13;
interviews. The objective of the observation was to learn about the internal dynamics of the&#13;
associations, their strengths and weaknesses, their needs and experiences, and their interactions with&#13;
outside organizations.&#13;
2.  The four associations were selected to participate in the test on the basis of their demonstrated&#13;
interest in energy cfficiency improvements and their organizational strength, thus they represent&#13;
"champion" associations. The multi-faceted support and observation yielded valuable information&#13;
regarding the capabilities and needs of these four homeowners associations, as well as more general&#13;
lessons that informed the design of the project.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
3.  Four principal interaction and observation methods were used in the test activity: official&#13;
consultation; expert advice and assistance; respondent interviews; and participant observation. The&#13;
four approaches complemented each other and, to some degree, also produced synergy amongst&#13;
each other. In particular, the participant observation activity was the one that most effectively&#13;
captured dynamics, assessed impact and identified gaps and needs.&#13;
4.  Official Consultation. The MCUD officially implemented the test activity. Both formally and&#13;
informally, officials of the MCUD maintained contacts with leaders of the four homeowners'&#13;
associations throughout the test activity, from the earliest inquiries regarding the level of interest in&#13;
participating in the activity through the later stage of negotiating loans through the participating&#13;
banks. Official contacts ranged from the Deputy Minister level to working technical levels, all of&#13;
whom were actively interested in the activity and conmmitted to moving it forward. MCUD officials&#13;
set participation rules and patterns, provided information regarding rights and procedures, and&#13;
played an advocacy role in their offices. Their active involvement revealed the extent to which&#13;
procedures and parameters were evolving during the activity itself, thus complicating the&#13;
consultation role. The involvement of MCUD staff also strengthened its awareness of the paucity&#13;
of information available and the key role of MCUD in information flows.&#13;
5.  Expert Advice and Assistance. External consultants worked in three stages on the test&#13;
activity. During the first stage, energy efficiency measurements and tests were conducted in&#13;
buildings of participating homeowners' associations and others. These were designed to provide&#13;
baseline data from which to assess the impact of improvement measures. At a second stage,&#13;
consultants devised energy efficiency and conservation measures (including cost and cost-savings&#13;
data) for specific buildings, including the four participating associations, discussed the&#13;
recommendations with associations and participated in discussions that lead to individual association&#13;
decisions regarding how to proceed; and prepared bidding documents to enable the associations to&#13;
tender for the works. In a third stage, consultants developed operational procedures for project&#13;
implementation, based on observations of various association meetings, and discussions with&#13;
officials and other stakeholders. The consultants infused the test activity with technical&#13;
information, provided insights into ways to prepare the information for homeowners, homeowners'&#13;
associations and officials, and ways to use the information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                                 Annex I&#13;
6.  Respondent Interviews. Two types of interviews were conducted in order to understand the&#13;
nature of the involvement of homeowners' association in each building, to ascertain the socio-&#13;
economic status of homeowners in the test buildings, and explore the attitudes toward a number of&#13;
issues that related to the project. First, a socio-economic survey was administered to a random&#13;
sample of 8-10 households in each building in a multi-step process. The first phase, undertaken at&#13;
the first stage of contact, focused on perceptions and information about the homeowners'&#13;
association, energy-saving, housing, pilot activities, banks, borrowing, and interest rates. The&#13;
second stage was a qualitative follow-up interview both to elaborate responses to the first stage and&#13;
to identify any changes in attitude regarding such things as the performance of the association, the&#13;
flow of information, and attitudes toward energy-saving, banks and other issues. In addition,&#13;
homeowners' association leaders were interviewed to learn more about the specific activities of the&#13;
associations, participation patterns of homeowners, institutional issues regarding the association and&#13;
the proposed project, and to obtain inputs regarding the needs of the association that might be met&#13;
through the project.&#13;
7.  Participant Observation. A local consultant followed every step of the test activity as a&#13;
participant observer. She attended board and general assembly meetings of the homeowners&#13;
associations, and meetings between the association and outside groups, particularly technical&#13;
consultants, banks and contractors, keeping notes and reporting on both the content and dynamics&#13;
of the meetings. Where possible, the consultant also arranged meetings to promote communication&#13;
and facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of information. Consistent with the role of&#13;
participant observer, the consultant became a ubiquitous attendee, acting primarily as catalyst and&#13;
institutional memory, but also taking an active advocacy role when appropriate. In addition to the&#13;
meetings, she conducted the qualitative household interviews and continually updated the&#13;
association leader data, recording changes in attitude and behavior, as well as perceived changes in&#13;
status.&#13;
Associations and Steps Observed&#13;
8.  Four associations participated in the test activity, each of which is unique, presenting special&#13;
challenges and special opportunities to learn about the diversity of homeowners' associations. A&#13;
brief comparison of the four associations is shown in Table 1, below.&#13;
Table 1: Participating Associations&#13;

9.  Only two of the four pilot associations finally took a loan and modernized the heating&#13;
equipment in its house. The other two were upheld in their internal decision making, as well as in&#13;
their decision making about whether or not to eventually take a loan, by general communication&#13;
problems and by overall fear and hesitation towards committing themselves to the burden of a loan.&#13;
Fear and hesitation, however, do not appear to have been related to the income situation of the&#13;
association members. Indeed, the members of the associations which eventually took a loan had, on&#13;
average, lower incomes than the members in the other associations. However, leadership and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -                                 Annex I&#13;
communication were rated highest in these association and appear to have contributed decisively to&#13;
its success in obtaining a loan and undertaking energy efficiency rehabilitations (see also para. 12&#13;
below).&#13;
10.  The associations differ in a number of dimensions, but the most critical dimensions related to&#13;
the project appear to be the following:&#13;
* prior experience: former cooperatives converted to homeowners' associations already have an&#13;
organizational advantage;&#13;
* leadership: some leaders take a directive stance, others actively engage members in decision-&#13;
making; the latter are most effective in introducing new ideas, such as preparing members to&#13;
take credit for common investments;&#13;
* resources: families with higher incomes are better prepared to invest in the buildings, as the&#13;
relative impact on family income will be smaller than it would be for poorer families; yet&#13;
resources are not the most decisive influence on whether or not an association eventually takes a&#13;
loan;&#13;
*  information: people are hungry for information; those that feel they have access, via their leaders or&#13;
otherwise, are more predisposed to participate in the program.&#13;
Lessons from the Test Activity&#13;
11. The most important result of the test activity is an understanding of the tremendous transaction&#13;
costs to homeowners associations of their attempts to improve energy efficiency under current&#13;
conditions. Even with the direct intervention of high Government officials in the concemed sector, the&#13;
activity consumed a significant amount of time, much of which must be eliminated if a demand driven&#13;
program is extended nationwide. Under existing arrangements, very few homeowners' association&#13;
leaders would have the time or the energy required to participate in such a program without assistance,&#13;
given their need both to get and evaluate information and to satisfy the questions and allay the fears of&#13;
their members. In addition, six other important lessons emerged from the test activity that must be&#13;
taken into account during project implementation:&#13;
(a)    homeowners' associations vary greatly in the strength, function, experience, and openness of&#13;
their members and leaders, for the most part, they need basic capacity building inputs;&#13;
(b)    homeowners have considerable interest in improving energy efficiency, but they know little&#13;
about technical options, costs, credit and credit conditions;&#13;
(c)    despite the huge need, homeowners' associations have little access to information about&#13;
renovation and miaintenance;&#13;
(d)    many homeowners are anxious about indebtedness and credit; although some of the anxiety may&#13;
be dispelled by access to good information, positive experiences will also be necessary;&#13;
(e)    while the concept of interest rates in general appears well understood, there is consensus that&#13;
interest rates of 15%, in a Government program, were 'outrageously high' yet just about the&#13;
maximum affordable.&#13;
(f)    individual homeowners and homeowners' associations are dependent on authorities and&#13;
contractors for information, yet mistrustful of them. Thus there is considerable demand for&#13;
independent advice.&#13;
12. Another important lesson from the test activity is that even very poor households are able to&#13;
afford borrowing for energy efficiency improvements if the size of the investments is kept moderate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -                                 Annex 1&#13;
One of the pilot associations demonstrated this by, in the course of the test-activity, taking a loan&#13;
amounting to approximately USD 100 per apartment owner. The association could cover the payments&#13;
for the loan through a 0.25 LT/sqm fee that had formerly been charged by the municipal maintenance&#13;
company - before the association decided to cancel the contract with the company as the maintenance&#13;
activities perfonred had been minimal. Therefore, without actually 'feeling' that they are paying extra&#13;
for the re-payment of the loan, individual homeowners yet benefit from the improvement in the house. It&#13;
should be noted that about half of the households of this particular association are eligible for the&#13;
heating subsidy described in Annex 2 (see also Annex 4 for more information on affordability).&#13;
Project Implications&#13;
13.  From the lessons learned from the test activities, four important implications emerged that will be&#13;
taken into account during project implementation:&#13;
(a)    It is essential to produce and disseminate clear, simple and complete information to&#13;
homeowners' associations and homeowners regarding technical options for energy savings&#13;
available to them and procedures for obtaining both advice and credit;&#13;
(b)    To gain the confidence of homeowners, and thus to accelerate the process of improving energy&#13;
efficiency' in housing, the operation of the program must be simple, transparent and fair,&#13;
providing open access to information and resources without favoritism, bureaucratic hindrances&#13;
or exaggerated expectations"&#13;
(c)    Homeowners' associations should be encouraged to help each other learn from their experiences&#13;
and articulate their needs by creating an association of homeowners associations.&#13;
14.  Through advisory centers or other mechanisms, such as an association of associations,&#13;
homeowners and homeowners' associations could be provided with independent information and advice,&#13;
as well as training in both technical and management areas. This can serve to empower them both&#13;
individually and collectively to manage their affairs and protect their interests. If successful, the centers&#13;
could be expected to be self-sustaining over time. Meanwhile, the example of homeowners' associations&#13;
that participate in the program will serve as a stimulus to homeowners in other buildings to establish&#13;
associations and will encourage officials and others to promote the further development of homeowners'&#13;
associations as active elements in a strong civil society.&#13;

2. EFFECTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEATING SUBSIDY&#13;
A.    DESIGN OF THE HEATING SUBSIDY&#13;
1.  The Lithuanian Government established, in 1994, an indirect subsidy program to reduce the&#13;
burden of heat and hot water costs on needy households (the latest Decree regulating the subsidy is&#13;
Decree No. 998 of 7/20/95). Heat billings that exceed 15% of household income (and hot water&#13;
billings that exceed 5 % of household income) can be deducted from the bill and not paid, for which&#13;
the district heating companies may claim reimbursement from the municipality.' Eligibility for and&#13;
size of the subsidy are established according to income, socio-economic classifications, heating&#13;
system, household size and the size of the apartment/living space:&#13;
(a)    Household income. The household income is assessed by the municipal social care&#13;
centers, on the basis of income information on all household members provided by the&#13;
applicant. Municipalities have no means of assessing the correctness of the information&#13;
provided. In theory, they could undertake spot-checks of applicants, yet limited&#13;
personnel does not allow for such assessments.&#13;
(b)    Eligible groups. The subsidy program specifies a detailed list of "low income families"&#13;
that are eligible for an exemption from paying more than 15% of their income towards&#13;
their heating bill. These comprise families in which spouse(s) are: (i) are regularly&#13;
employed, (ii) unemployed due to pursuing education, not finding a job (being registered&#13;
as unemployed), due to medical conditions or disability, or due to medical conditions or&#13;
disability of a family member who needs to be nursed, (iii) pensioners, old or disabled,&#13;
(iv) employed or unemployed, and the other one is unemployed due to pregnancy,&#13;
maternity leave (up to three years for only child, up to 8 years, if there are three&#13;
children undcr 16, or when there is no day care center or when the child's health&#13;
requires nursing), or a combination of maternity leave with farming of more than 2&#13;
hectares of land.&#13;
(c)    Size of living space and size of household. The size of the living space which to heat&#13;
may be subsidized depends upon household size and specific socioeconomic&#13;
characteristics. Normally, billings for heating 20 sqm per household member are&#13;
eligible for the subsidy, whenever a household member is disabled or a pensioner the&#13;
number of sqm rises to 30 sqm for this household member. Single inhabitants of&#13;
apartments are eligible for a subsidy for heating 36 sqm per person. In addition, 15 sqm&#13;
may be added respectively for heating kitchen/bathroom/etc.&#13;
(d)    Heating systems. Only households who live in dwellings connected to the DH system&#13;
and/or local boilers operating on metered natural gas are eligible for the heating subsidy.&#13;
B.    OPERATION OF SUBSIDY&#13;
2.  The number of eligible households has increased greatly between the heating seasons of&#13;
1994/1995 and 1995/1996. According to a representative household survey conducted during spring&#13;
1995 about 8% of urban households benefit from this program. For the heating season 1995/1996,&#13;
1     The cost of hot water is subsidized under the same decree, according to similar procedures. If the bill for hot&#13;
water exceeds 5% of a household's income then the billing above this threshold does not have to be paid by the&#13;
household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                                 Annex 2&#13;
no official data on the number of households eligible is available as of yet. Information collected&#13;
from the Vilnius DH company and the Vilnius municipality appears to imply that, during&#13;
October/November/December 1995 more than 1/3 of all households in Vilnius were eligible for the&#13;
subsidy and received, effectively, on average 23 LT/month as a subsidy to their heating bill.&#13;
3.  The increase in the number of eligible households may be attributed to a combination of the&#13;
following three factors: (a) prices of residential heat were increased, in summer 1995, from LT&#13;
1. 12/sqm to LT 2.40/sqm in nominal terms, (b) outside temperatures in November/December 1995&#13;
were relatively low in comparison to the previous year, and therefore heating bills were higher, (c)&#13;
there is anecdotal evidence that the extent to which firms tend to underdeclare wages paid to their&#13;
employees has increased over the last year. This assertion is supported by the Vilnius&#13;
municipality's observation, that between 60% - 70% of all eligible applicants for the heating&#13;
subsidy were employed by the private sector, nonetheless wages in the private sector tend to be&#13;
higher than Government wages.&#13;
4.  While the heating subsidy has certain advantages - it ensures the use of the implicit income&#13;
transfer for the purpose it has been assigned and the transaction costs involved in its administration&#13;
are minimal - there are several serious flaws in its design and operation: (a) it appears to benefit a&#13;
population group much larger than the actual poor as municipalities have no means to control the&#13;
correctness of income statements on which eligibility depends, (b) it excludes most of the rural&#13;
population - where poverty indices are higher - as it only applies to dwellings connected to the DH&#13;
system or to local boilers that operate with metered natural gas, (c) it is suspected that the district&#13;
heating companies may in many cases simply have to absorb the cost of the subsidy themselves, and&#13;
(d) as it operates on a percentage basis it removes the incentive for eligible households to save&#13;
energy.&#13;
C.    ELIGIBILITY ACCORDING TO DWEELING SIZE&#13;
5.  The amount by which a household's heating bill is subsidized is limited by the size of its&#13;
dwelling (see above). This restriction is reasonable given the assumption that poor households live&#13;
in smaller apartments and also considering budgetary restrictions for the financing of the subsidy.&#13;
Indeed, the survey undertaken in spring 1995 indicates that there is a positive relationship between&#13;
household income and living area in sqm. Poor households live on less space: The income group&#13;
of &lt; 240 LT had a living space of 28 sqm (total area: 43 sqm), while those in the 900 LT or above&#13;
income group had a living space of 46 sqm (68 sqm).&#13;
6.  However, as eligibility is calculated according to household member per sqm of dwelling, the&#13;
less members a poor household has the higher the likelihood that it does not fully benefit from the&#13;
subsidy. The survey referred to above indicates indeed that 48.2% of the lowest income households&#13;
(&lt; 240 LT) belong to the group of households with the largest living area per household member&#13;
(more than 26.7 sqm/person), nonetheless in this group there is relatively little space for the whole&#13;
household. Apparently, poor households have a tendency to live on large space per person. This is&#13;
in line with information available from real estate agents in Lithuania that 1-2 room apartments are&#13;
bought and sold at considerably higher sqm.-prices than 3-4 room apartments. It appears likely that&#13;
large apartments tend to be owned by pensioners; under the soviet system this group, then still part&#13;
of a larger famnily, had access to large apartments. Given the low mobility in housing, pensioners&#13;
have remained in their premises even if most other family members have moved out (see also&#13;
Annex 1 on attitudes towards housing and energy efficiency).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -                                   Annex 2&#13;
7.  The data available suggest therefore that at least half of all poor households do have to pay&#13;
more than 15% of their income for heating. Any amount paid for heating by a household exceeding&#13;
the 15% benchrrark therefore is paid for heating the part of a dwelling that is not eligible for the&#13;
subsidy. It is this other 'rest' that may constitute an incentive to invest in energy savings,&#13;
irrespective of the existing subsidy, and that may compensate also the poor household for its&#13;
investment by providing scope for savings.&#13;
D.     RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HEATING SUBSIDY AND THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
8.  The success of the proposed project is affected by the current heating subsidy in two ways:&#13;
(a)    Households who fully benefit from the subsidy have little incentive to invest in energy&#13;
efficiency savings, given that whatever they spend on energy above 15% of their income&#13;
is paid for by the municipality. However, the subsidy's effect on the motivation for&#13;
saving energy will depend on (i) the degree by which a households' bill is subsidized (if&#13;
a household spends 15.5% or 16% of its income on heating, chances to reduce the bill&#13;
down to 14% and thereby to actually save on the bill are much higher in comparison to a&#13;
household who spends 30% of its income on heating2; the same rationale applies to&#13;
households who only partially benefit from the subsidy as their dwelling space is too&#13;
large, as described under section C); and (b) the household's expectations with respect to&#13;
its future income and the future of the heating subsidy (if a household expects that its&#13;
income will increase over time then it can assume to loose its eligibility; if a household&#13;
expects the Government to abolish the heating subsidy, or to raise the threshold, then&#13;
investing in energy efficiency rehabilitation would be reasonable irrespecitve of its&#13;
current eligibility for the subsidy).&#13;
(b)    There is a real possibility that poor households are adversely affected by a decision of&#13;
their building's homeowners' association to invest in energy savings. Poor households&#13;
who are eligible for the heating subsidy may not - if their actual bill substantially&#13;
exceeds 15 % of their income - benefit from the energy savings derived from the&#13;
investment at all, yet they will have to contribute nonetheless to the repayment of a loan&#13;
taken to finance the investment.&#13;
9.  The data available only allows rough estimates of the size of the population that may belong to&#13;
the group described under 8(b). As noted above, evidence from the city of Vilnius suggests that,&#13;
during the heating season 1995/1996 the number of households eligible for the subsidy amounted to&#13;
more than 1/3. However, not all those eligible for the heating subsidy appear to belong to the&#13;
poorest households of society. The municipal social care center estimates that about 60% - 70% of&#13;
these households had household members employed by private firms. The widespread anecdotal&#13;
evidence on wage-certification fraud (firms declare low wages in order to circumvent having to pay&#13;
wage taxes) suggests that the percentage of real poor among these 33 % (of the population eligible&#13;
for the subsidy) is likely to be as low as 30%. Therefore, about 10% of all households may find&#13;
themselves in a situation where there are energy efficiency rehabilitation investments undertaken in&#13;
their buildings from which they do not benefit immediately, and which they will find difficult to&#13;
finance given their limited resources. As income groups are scattered across buildings, these&#13;
2      There is no data available about the distribution of expenditure for heating - above the threshold of 15% - but&#13;
the survey data available suggests that the degree by which the threshold is exceeded cannot be too large.&#13;
&#13;

households may easily find themselves representing only a minority in a homeowners' association&#13;
that discusses investing in energy efficiency rehabilitation. In order to protect poor households&#13;
from situations in which unreasonably high loan repayments are imposed onto them under the&#13;
project, investment size will be linked to unanimity of decision among homeowners within any&#13;
given association (see also Annex 4 on affordability).&#13;

3. TECHNICAL DETAILS&#13;
A. PROJECT COMPONENTS, EXPECTED SAVINGS AND COST&#13;
1.  The project will be directed towards thermal energy saving improvements for residential and&#13;
selected school buildings. The thermal inefficiencies found in these buildings follow typical patterns&#13;
for most of the structures built under former Soviet design norms.&#13;
2.  Residential energy saving improvements will be undertaken by homeowners' associations&#13;
(HOA) on behalf of members, and are expected to occur primarily in multi-family residential&#13;
structures. Some loans may also be provided for single-family houses. Credits for school&#13;
improvements will be channeled through municipal authorities to agencies responsible for the&#13;
management and maintenance of school buildings.&#13;
Eligible measures&#13;
3.  Project support for selected buildings will be limited to the implementation of physical&#13;
improvements that reduce the buildings' consumption of energy for space heating at a given comfort&#13;
level and for the production and distribution of domestic hot water. However, in cases where&#13;
serious structural problems exist, urgent repairs that do not have primarily energy-saving purposes&#13;
can be justified where necessary to protect the structural integrity of the building and thereby the&#13;
thermal efficiency investments, such as roof reconstruction and joint/crack repairs.&#13;
4.  Typical inefficiencies that are eligible for corrective measures include low thermal resistance&#13;
values for the building envelope assemblies (e.g. walls, roofs and windows), excessive cold weather&#13;
ventilation volumes, absence of building-level temperature and balancing controls, and general&#13;
deterioration of mechanical and building assemblies, such as windows and pipes. In addition to the&#13;
above-mentioned weaknesses, the absence of controls for heat and hot water consumption at the&#13;
consumer interface, as well as the absence of metering, contributes significantly to waste as there is&#13;
no incentive to conserve. Measures that permit user control have the potential of affecting&#13;
consumer behavior and will be eligible.&#13;
5.  Since the correction of all the faults of a building would not be financially feasible under&#13;
current circumstances, priorities will have to be determined in each case. For schools, the choice of&#13;
measures will be made by local officials according to municipal technical and budgetary&#13;
requirements. For residential structures, priorities will be determined by building owners according&#13;
to the particular social, economic and physical circumstances of each building. Engineering&#13;
evaluation listing potential improvements fitting each structure's technical requirements and&#13;
providing economic estimates will be carried out by consultants for the owners. Thus each building&#13;
will have an investment package tailored to its particular needs, with measures selected from a list&#13;
of technically evaluated measures.&#13;
Project Preparation Studies&#13;
6.  During project preparation, the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD)&#13;
obtained grants to undertake technical investigations of the physical status of a number of apartment&#13;
buildings, hospitals and schools and analyze options for improvement. Two consulting firms were&#13;
assigned to evaluate a total of 14 apartment buildings, one school and one hospital. Technical&#13;
analysis comprised evaluation of the state of the building envelope (roof, external walls, basement,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56-                                  Annex 3&#13;
and general structural and interior condition) and the heating system within the building (incoming&#13;
District Heating pipes and domestic hot water pipes, building substation, distribution of heating&#13;
water, radiators, temperature control, etc.). Options for investments in the building envelope and&#13;
heating system for each building to improve energy efficiency were proposed and described - where&#13;
possible after discussions with the HOA, and evaluated on the basis of concrete estimates of the&#13;
local cost of materials and equipment. Energy-saving measures were assembled in efficient&#13;
packages suited to the building needs, with possible alternatives that can be added to or deducted&#13;
from the base package.&#13;
Expected Energy Savings&#13;
7.  Potential energy savings were calculated for the case study buildings. In some cases, where&#13;
teniperatures have in recent years been low due to reduced output from the DH systems, potential&#13;
energy savings were calculated for both the "normal" (18 C) and the low (about 13 C) final room&#13;
temiiperatures. Data from the preparation studies indicate reductions of energy consumption of&#13;
about 20(% for basic packages, 30-40% for medium-size packages and as high as 50% in some cases&#13;
where all possible measures are taken. Actual savings will depend on the scope of measures selected&#13;
by the owners. Minimum interventions indicate savings of about 25%. Payback times for the&#13;
energy savings part of the investments range from as low as two years, to as much as 25 years for&#13;
measures assemb'ed together in a single package.&#13;
Expected Investment Packages&#13;
8.  It is expected that priority decisions will be made by the owners according to perceived&#13;
immediate economic and environmental (comfort) impacts. The ranking of measures by payback&#13;
period is generally uncomplicated so the investment packages that will be chosen are fairly&#13;
predictable. For example, since immediate savings and comfort can be obtained at relatively low&#13;
cost by reducing air infi:tration through windows and doors, and since virtually all buildings suffer&#13;
from such weaknesses, it is expected that window and door refurbishing and weather-stripping will&#13;
be a basic measure chosen by nearly all borrowers.&#13;
9.  Other basic measures will include substation improvements such as building temperature&#13;
control with motorized flow control valves, heat system balancing and heat exchangers for the space&#13;
heating and domestic hot water systems, as well as basement and attic pipe insulation. Building-&#13;
level heat meters will be a prerequisite for participation in the program. If a heat meter is not&#13;
already installed in a proposed building, the owner will be obliged to include one in any basic&#13;
investment package. Building temperature controllers will be necessary in order to derive heat bill&#13;
savings from building envelope improvements. Such controllers affect the flow of water in the DH&#13;
sv stem. and in large quantities (more than 20% - 30% of buildings connected to each system) would&#13;
disrupt overall system performance. However, the scope of the project is too limited for this&#13;
proportion to be reached. In addtion, DH companies have the right to review sub-station&#13;
improvements through the existing permit process.&#13;
10.  Because of their higher cost per unit of energy saved and consequent longer payback&#13;
periods. less common investments are expected to include major building envelope improvements -&#13;
e.g. roof and wall insulation - and new windows. However, since many buildings have badly&#13;
deteriorated roofs that would qualify for urgent repairs under the project, new roof assemblies that&#13;
fix immediate problems (such as leaking), ensure a long period of low maintenance costs, and at the&#13;
same time provide superior insulation are expected to be part of loan packages where affordable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -                                 Annex 3&#13;
'i. New sloped roof structures built over existing flat roofs are considered desirable to avoid the&#13;
long-term maintenance problems associated with flat roofs. Such assemblies would be considered&#13;
fully justified by energy-saving. The cost of such assemblies may be similar to a flat roof of equally&#13;
low maintenance needs and long life expectancy. Some HOAs may choose to invest in a new&#13;
sloped roof, and some may wish to solve a roof problem in the short term by choosing shorter-lived&#13;
low-specification flat roof repairs. In either case, insulation should be installed during the repair&#13;
process. A few HOAs are interested in building new sloped roofs raised to include additional&#13;
apartments on the old roof level. It is argued that the sale of such apartments could help cover the&#13;
cost of other improvements in the building. In the event that an HOA chooses this option, the loan&#13;
would cover the cost of a new sloped roof structure with insulation, but not the incremental cost of&#13;
raising this structure and enclosing/finishing the apartment space.&#13;
12.  Table 1 below gives a general description and total energy use data for two buildings&#13;
evaluated in the case studies, chosen because they are representative. The buildings, measures and&#13;
categories are the same as those used to calculate project economic analysis and affordability. (See&#13;
Annex 12, Economic Analysis, for a discussion of economic rationale pertaining to these measures.)&#13;
The following tables list the measures typically expected to be implemented by homeowners,&#13;
packaged into three prioritized categories, with costs and estimated financial pay-back times for&#13;
typical large and small buildings. Tables 2 and 3 provide cost and energy savings data from the&#13;
studies for the two representative buildings.&#13;

case studies, preliminary cost estimates for the expected packages range from about Litas 350 per&#13;
apartment unit for basic measures (in large buildings), to Litas 10,500 (in small buildings) for&#13;
complete packages covering all evaluated energy improvement interventions. In some cases with&#13;
low initial cost and rapid payback time, the incremental cost per month to amortize the loan is&#13;
estimated to be covered by the cash energy savings. However, assumed "before and after" room&#13;
temperatures, heat consumption measurement and tariff calculation, and consumer behavior all&#13;
influence the calculation of such estimates.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
14.   The implementation of technical activities will ensure full participation of beneficiaries and&#13;
follow transparent and competitive procurement procedures.&#13;
15.   Design. Physical design/engineering will be done in two stages: evaluation of the building&#13;
and its needs, along with schematic design, will be accomplished by local consultants under close&#13;
supervision of foreign consultants with expertise in energy-saving analysis and design, provided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                                       Annex 3&#13;
through Technical Assistance. Preliminary and final design will be developed by the local&#13;
consultant with foreign consultant guidance as needed.&#13;
16.   Construction. The construction industry has excess capacity, is adapting to market forces&#13;
and virtually all construction enterprises are operating without State support. Project construction&#13;
will be undertaken by local firms of varying sizes in order to expand the participation of small&#13;
enterprises, as well as to provide the mix of skills necessary for the range of work required to&#13;
implement the project. It is expected that there will be good opportunities for small new firms able&#13;
to implement measures that are labor-intensive and that require a certain degree of skill such as&#13;
refurbishing of windows.&#13;
17.   Supervision and commissioning. Supervision of construction for design intent will be carried&#13;
out by the HOA's consultant. Governmental construction permit procedures will ensure that&#13;
building and public safety regulations are observed. In addition, it is expected that the participating&#13;
commercial lending institutions will use their own inspection procedures for certification of&#13;
payments from the loan. In addition, the Procect Coordination Unit (PCU) may assist in inspecting&#13;
installations for integrity of energy conservation performance.&#13;
B. CAPACITIES OF THE LITHUANIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY&#13;
1.   Constructionfirms. Prior to independence, the construction industry in Lithuania included&#13;
nearly 300 construction and assembly firms that employed up to 12 percent of the nation's labor&#13;
force and generated about 20% of total GNP. During 1991-93, however, employment in the sector&#13;
dropped to less than 5 % of the labor force and the contribution to GNP fell to 7.4%. After reaching&#13;
a nadir in 1993, the Lithuanian construction industry has begun to adjust to the structural changes&#13;
of economic transition and the resulting new market conditions by privatizing and downsizing. The&#13;
problem of overcapacity is being addressed, but not yet resolved. The export of Lithuanian&#13;
expertise and labor has softened the impact of reduced construction activity at home (foreign work&#13;
in the FSU increased by 30% after independence, and represented about 16% of the industry's 1993&#13;
domestic volume).' According to the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development, 98% of&#13;
construction and building materials industries are privatized [1994]. Most of these are not ready to&#13;
compete and survive under the current changing market conditions, and significant restructuring is&#13;
expected to occur in the industry over the next five years.  Encouraged by favorable tax treatment3&#13;
small companies are entering the market to meet the demand for small-scale private construction,&#13;
alterations, and repairs.&#13;
2.   Building Materials, Distribution and Retailing. The building materials industry's production&#13;
has also dropped since 1990, but not as much as construction activity, thanks largely to exports,&#13;
which actually increased after 1990. However, the impact of superior imported materials and&#13;
I       While over 5,000 firms are now registered with the Ministry of Economy as construction firms, this number is&#13;
thought to be highly inflated. A more likely number is 550-600 active firms, plus self-employed journeymen working on&#13;
an opportunity basis. The majority are privatized joint-stock companies. Proprietorships and foreign joint ventures&#13;
represent a very small part of the whole. The nature of Lithuania's privatized joint-stock companies is similar to that of&#13;
other FSU countries.&#13;
2       The impact of such restructuring will be felt primarily by the companies that are too large, inefficient and&#13;
focused on single technologies to compete for the small-scale construction and rehabilitation projects that will constitute&#13;
the thrust of market demand for the next several years.&#13;
Firms with fewer than 50 employees pay 50% of the rate paid by larger firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                                        Annex 3&#13;
methods is being felt, as Lithuanian production systems and design are outdated. While the&#13;
industry is trying to modernize, sufficient financing for needed capital investment is unavailable.&#13;
Both local and imported materials are readily available in Lithuania, and there are no restrictions on&#13;
the import or use of foreign construction materials as long as they meet the standards of the&#13;
exporting country. Local industry produces the basic products of cement, lime, wood, glass, clay,&#13;
metals, and plastics.4 Wood windows and doors are made in Lithuania, and the production of&#13;
mineral wool insulation is expected to start soon. The construction materials and supplies&#13;
distribution system has not yet developed in Lithuania. For all practical purposes wholesale trade&#13;
does not exist.5&#13;
3.   Design Firms and Labor. Lithuania has an abundance of trained and experienced architects&#13;
and engineers, but no system of regulation and licensing. Most are still to be found in large "design&#13;
institutes" that formerly were state entities, and many individuals moonlight as private consultants.&#13;
The construction labor force is well-trained and sufficient to support currently projected increases in&#13;
construction activity . Lithuania has a well-developed training program for construction trades, and&#13;
enrollment is deemed sufficient to fulfill skilled labor requirements in the near future. Design and&#13;
construction professionals are also readily available, according to industry managers.&#13;
4.   Technology and Equipment. In Lithuania, construction materials and methods, and the&#13;
concomitant problems, are typical of FSU countries: brick and concrete are the main structural&#13;
materials, with large panel pre-cast concrete being the most common for buildings built in the last&#13;
20 years. The effect of this single system approach on the construction industry is to make it more&#13;
rigid and less flexible in adapting to new demands of varying scale and of competition in the&#13;
market. Light wood or steel frame construction is likely to become more popular. It is felt that the&#13;
strongest part of the housing market will be for low-rise, detached or high-density row housing.&#13;
The heavy equipment in the inventories of large firms in Lithuania exceeds any current or projected&#13;
industry need. Some of this is stockpiled abroad in other FSU countries, but the surplus is still&#13;
clear. This equipment is generally quite old, however, often dating to the '50's and '60's. In the&#13;
near future, the industry will face the need to replace much of its equipment. However, equipment&#13;
rental firms are being established and construction firms frequently borrow equipment from each&#13;
other.&#13;
5.   Procurement systems and experience. Although experience is limited, Government seeks to&#13;
promote competitive bidding and has instituted procedures for public procurement following&#13;
methods acceptable to the Bank. The legal structure for the system is in place, and Bank standard&#13;
documents are accepted. The private sector has also begun to use competitive procurement&#13;
methods.&#13;
4       Controls on imported materials are expected to increase as current review and revision of standards and norms&#13;
rogresses.&#13;
Although over 700 building materials wholesalers are listed with the Ministry of Economy, they are thought to&#13;
be mainly manufacturers and foreign product representatives. Contractors are obliged to overstock in order to maintain&#13;
needed materials levels (many operate their own retail outlets in conjunction with their construction activities). Foreign&#13;
materials and supplies are readily imported and available, at import duties ranging from 10 to 25%, in addition to 18%&#13;
VAT. Better quality and appearance have made imported products popular to the broader public in spite of being two to&#13;
three times more expensive. However, prices for imports are falling as foreign manufacturers started to avoid&#13;
intermediary local companies and come directly into the market. Increased competition from foreign imports has forced&#13;
some local producers to shut down or reduce production.&#13;
6       About 120,000 jobs in construction were lost since 1990. While many workers have been absorbed in other&#13;
areas, former workers can be considered as a part of the available labor pool.&#13;

C. AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY-RELATED BUILDING MATERIALS&#13;
1.  Loose insulation for attics is manufactured in Lithuania and is inexpensive. High density&#13;
mineral wool insulation for roofs is not made in Lithuania, but joint ventures between Lithuanian&#13;
and Nordic companies will soon meet anticipated increase in demand. External wall insulation,&#13;
because of the high cost of imported materials and continuing low energy pricing, is not expected to&#13;
be demanded in significant quantities in the near future. Lithuanian firms have little experience in&#13;
the fabrication of external insulation, but a few are in the process of importing this know-how or&#13;
creating new local products that are significantly cheaper than imported ones, a step that might have&#13;
the effect of increasing demand.&#13;
2.  Windows and doors manufactured under former Soviet conditions and standards are among the&#13;
weakest links in building energy conservation. Where new windows and doors are necessary,&#13;
imported PVC or wood units are unaffordable. However, local production of European type has&#13;
begun, and the products are significantly cheaper than the imports. While heating system equipment&#13;
- including exchangers, pumps, valves and electronic controls - is mostly available locally or from&#13;
Russia, Lithuanians are turning towards more technologically sound imported products. Local&#13;
companies can be expected to improve their participation in the market by adapting modern&#13;
technologies to their production as well as through joint ventures with foreign producers. System&#13;
quality and range of choice of equipment will improve through this process.&#13;

4. AFFORDABILITY AND SUBSIDY ANALYSIS&#13;
Onlending Terms to Ultimate Borrowers and Affordability&#13;
1.  As described in Section III-C and in Annex 6, proceeds of the project would be onlent, in local&#13;
currency, to the final borrowers (homeowners and homeowners' associations) through commercial&#13;
banks. Terms would be determined as follows and are subject to adjustments as experience is being&#13;
gained:&#13;
(a)    Loan amount: Up to 90% of investment. Minimum downpayment of 10%.&#13;
(b)    Maturity: From 3 up to 10 years and in all cases no more than the length of the expected&#13;
payback period (size of loan divided by estimated annual savings in energy cost).&#13;
(c)    Repayment method Graduated payment method, currently assumed at a graduation rate of&#13;
12% p.a. (or average inflation rate for the next decade). At this rate, payments would&#13;
basically be maintained in real terms. For a 10 year loan, this method yields negative&#13;
amortization in the first three to four years. For loans with maturity of six years or less, all&#13;
amortization would be positive.&#13;
(d)    Interest rate: Proceeds from the project would be onlent from the revolving fund (see&#13;
Annex 6) through commercial banks at the prevailing rate.&#13;
2.  Affordability is difficult to determine based on available data and knowledge. Official income&#13;
data does not provide the full picture of resources available to households. Household income has&#13;
fluctuated greatly during the past year. There is little 'rule of thumb' to indicate what is considered&#13;
to be affordable (such as housing expenditures as share of income) in the context of Lithuania.&#13;
However, examining ten case studies in the cities of Vilnius, Kaunas and Alytus which involve&#13;
investments ranging from LT 400 to LT 6400 per apartment for various renovation packages (Table&#13;
1), it is evident that loans for certain renovations would have significant financial burden on&#13;
households with low income.&#13;
3.  Of particular concern is the potential impact of borrowing for those who are currently&#13;
qualified for the government's subsidy for residential heating and hot water. As monthly loan&#13;
payment would be offset by less saving in energy cost for these apartment owners (part of the&#13;
savings will be reaped by the government in terms of reduced subsidy on utilities) the incentive for&#13;
them to renovate for energy efficiency is lower than for their neighbors in the same building. This&#13;
might cause two types of problems: poor households may be forced to participate because they are&#13;
usually a minority; or households currently enjoying subsidies will be blocking otherwise good&#13;
measures to improve energy efficiency because they see themselves benefiting less by comparison.&#13;
However, this is not expected to affect a significant portion of the population. This matter will be&#13;
closely monitored and studied during the initial year of project implementation. In the longer term,&#13;
it will be addressed through the rationalization and consolidation of the social safety net system, and&#13;
the rationalization of household spending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                                 Annex 4&#13;
Subsidy&#13;
4.  In addition to potential difficulties faced by households in meeting their monthly payments if&#13;
no subsidy is to be provided, detailed beneficiary studies revealed apprehension towards taking a&#13;
loan, even if affordable, because of the substantial transaction costs involved in organizing such&#13;
collective actions, and the social learning cost of moving from a 50 year tradition of relying on the&#13;
Government to take care of housing. Hence, an initial incentive in the form of a subsidy is required&#13;
during initial project implementation. Mistrust and apprehension amongst households concerning&#13;
the correctness of available information, including information on energy savings to be expected&#13;
from specific rehabilitation measures, increases their perceived risk of such activities. Qualitative&#13;
interviews with households willing to and already engaged in collective activities for energy&#13;
efficiency improvements indicate that interest rates of, at maximum, 15% would be considered&#13;
acceptable (see Annex 1-C). A tradition of receiving benefits for free and government loans at 5%&#13;
or 8% appears to have created resistance against loans at interest rates higher than 15%. From&#13;
currently available data, a subsidy which will yield an effective interest of 15% seems appropriate&#13;
for the first year of project implementation. This would place most households at a comfortable&#13;
position of spending less than 2-3% of their income for comprehensive renovation packages. It is&#13;
expected that the subsidy level will be reviewed semi-annually to take into account the changes in&#13;
people's attitude to borrow for cost effective energy saving measures, and market interest rates.&#13;
Over time this general subsidy will be phased out or reoriented to the neediest.&#13;
5.  Subsidies will be provided on a month to month basis in the form of reduced payment&#13;
obligation. All borrowers in good standing will be eligible. Although administratively this is more&#13;
cumbersome than a lump sum subsidy at the time of investment, the matching payment method will&#13;
have the added advantage of making the subsidy evident to program beneficiaries throughout the life&#13;
of the loan.&#13;
6.  Using data from five case studies, the financial burden on poor households including single&#13;
pensioners with no other sources of income and those in the three lowest income deciles is&#13;
examined and presented in Table 2 and Figures 1-4. The Figures show percentages of household&#13;
income that would have to be spent on servicing the debt for energy efficiency renovations under&#13;
the following four discrete situations: (1) with Government subsidy and with the full benefit of&#13;
energy savings; (2) with Government subsidy but without any benefit of energy savings; (3) with no&#13;
Government subsidy but with full benefit of energy savings; and (4) with neither subsidy nor&#13;
benefit of energy savings. This is obviously a simplification of real life situations where many&#13;
households in these income categories are eligible for some but not the full heating and hot water&#13;
subsidies (i.e. most cases lie between Figures I and 2 with repayment subsidies, and between&#13;
Figures 3 and 4 without repayment subsidies).&#13;
7.  As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, with Government subsidies in loan repayment, even the very&#13;
poor households will be able to afford the very modest packages (cases la and 2a). This holds true&#13;
even in cases in which part of the savings will benefit the Government as a reduction in heating&#13;
subsidies. With the exception of the poorest 10%, many basic packages (such as 5b and 9b) are&#13;
within the reach of low income households. As demonstrated in Figures 3 and 4 , most households&#13;
in low income groups would not be able to afford the basic packages (cases Sb, 9b and 10) without&#13;
Government subsidies. For the project to gain acceptance by the majority of the population at the&#13;
outset, subsidies on repayment appear to be well justified.&#13;

6. FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS FOR A REVOLVING FUND&#13;
1. Under the proposed project, the Government of Lithuania (GOL) and the Bank loan would&#13;
provide a total of about US$13.8 million for the rehabilitation of private homes to improve thermal&#13;
efficiency. In order to increase the impact of this pilot project to meet a greater part of the&#13;
projected financial needs for rehabilitation of private homes, loans for Residential Energy&#13;
Efficiency Improvements will function as a revolving fund in local currency.&#13;
2. Proforma projections of the revolving fund (RF) and assumptions used for the projections are&#13;
provided below. The model indicates that the RF would be financially sustainable for about ten&#13;
years. During this period, the revolving mechanism would allow it to provide loans up to a total of&#13;
about 128 million Litas (or 68 million Litas in 1995 terms) after servicing the Bank loan over the&#13;
full 20 year period, and providing all applicable subsidies to borrowers during the ten year period.&#13;
Technical assistance to be provided under the project will include the development of a strategy for&#13;
redirecting or phasing out of the RF.&#13;
Sources of Funds&#13;
3. Bank Loan - US$8.2 million will be passed on from the MOF, through the RF, to commercial&#13;
banks to provide loans to homeowners. Funds will be passed on to the RF in local currency. The&#13;
Bank loan is to be disbursed over eight semesters starting July 1996.&#13;
4. Government Contribution - US$5.6 million will be provided directly to the RF and in local&#13;
currency over seven senmesters starting July 1996.&#13;
5. Repavment of Loans - Monthly payments to be made by borrowers (interest and principal) will&#13;
be collected by participating commercial banks and paid into the RF. For lending to owners of&#13;
single family home and individual apartments, the commercial banks will bear the full credit risks&#13;
and include a 4% spread to cover such risks. For lending to HOAs, the funds will be onlent&#13;
through commercial banks with 100% government guarantee at the outset. Accordingly, the&#13;
commercial banks will process the loans (appraisal, negotiation, disbursement and collection) on a&#13;
fee for service basis. Specifically, the banks will be paid a I % fee on funds disbursed (to cover&#13;
cost of loan processing up to and including the cost of disbursing the funds), and a 3% fee on&#13;
funds collected from HOAs (to cover loan servicing costs). The commercial banks will have the&#13;
option to take on all or part of the credit risk over time. The spread and fee structure will be re-&#13;
negotiated periodically to reflect changed circumstances. Graduated payment method (at 12% p.a.)&#13;
may be used to improve affordability in the initial year(s) and maintain monthly payment more or&#13;
less level in real terms. 60%, 30% and 10% of funds are expected to be passed on as ten-year, six-&#13;
year and three-year loans respectively, reflecting roughly the different payback periods of various&#13;
types of investments.&#13;

Uses of Funds&#13;
6.  Repayment of Bank Loan - MOF will be responsible for servicing the full Bank loan including&#13;
the US$1.8 portion onlent to municipalities for the renovation of schools. However, out of the RF&#13;
account, the portion of the loan has to be serviced that covers loans to home owners and HOAs,&#13;
cost to establish and operate the Project Coordination Unit, cost to cover the annual audit as&#13;
required by the Bank, as well as activities under the technical assistance and institutional&#13;
development components not financed through grants.&#13;
7.  Government Subsidies - Government subsidy will be financed out of the RF with the&#13;
objectives to improve affordability, reduce risk avert behavior, and encourage participation (see&#13;
Annex I and Annex 4 on willingness to pay and affordability). All borrowers in good standing will&#13;
be eligible for the subsidy which will be presented as a reduction in monthly payments. At the&#13;
beginning of the project, the level of subsidy will be set so as to give the borrowers a cost&#13;
corresponding to a loan interest of 15%. As of January 1996, subsidy for 10, 6 and 3 year loans&#13;
are estimated to be 51 %, 37% and 22% of total payment. This represents the difference in monthly&#13;
payment between an estimated market rate of 33 % (T-bill at 28 % plus I % for the Ministry of&#13;
Finance to cover administrative costs for the RF and credit risks for lending to banks, plus 4%&#13;
spread to cover cost and credit risk for lending to home owners and HOAs) and 15 %. The subsidy&#13;
level will be reviewed and determined periodically.&#13;
8.  Loans Processed through Commercial Banks - Funds after payment of all applicable&#13;
Governmnent subsidies and debt servicing obligations will be available for lending through&#13;
commercial banks.&#13;
General Assunptions&#13;
9.  The following general assumptions are the basis of the calcuations for the Fund:&#13;
(a)    Domestic inflation rate: 20% for 1996, 15% for 1997, and 10% for 1998 and thereafter.&#13;
(b)    Exchange rate: As of January 1996, the local currency is officially pegged to the USD at 4&#13;
Litas per Dollar. All loan proceeds would be passed on in Litas to the Fund, commercial&#13;
banks, and ultimate borrowers. MOF would bear the full exchange risks associated with&#13;
the Bank loan in Dollars. Based on the projected international and domestic inflation rates,&#13;
a reserve will be included in the RF to cover possible fluctuations in the exchange rate&#13;
between the Dollar and the Lita.&#13;
(c)    Downpavment: 10% for all loans to homeowners and HOAs.&#13;

8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
A. CONCEPTS OF MONITORING AND MEASURING&#13;
1.  In most projects, project monitoring is primarily a management tool used to obtain information&#13;
about implementation progress and impact that can be used to overcome problems and bottlenecks.&#13;
to identify new opportunities and challenges, to incorporate lessons from experience into ongoing&#13;
operations, and to assess the relative success of the overall project and its components in meeting its&#13;
objectives. These objectives are of particular relevance for the proposed Energy&#13;
Efficiency/Housing Pilot project, as it is fundamentally designed to develop the capacity of&#13;
individuals and institutions to assume ownership of project activities and outcomes. By definition,&#13;
such projects as this are designed and implemented based on very limited knowledge and&#13;
experience. Even if desired outcomes and impact are clear and easily defined, implementation&#13;
approaches are well articulated and structured, and implementation mechanisms appear to be&#13;
acceptable to various stakeholders, the project itself offers the first test of the validity and&#13;
compatibility of project concepts. The project itself is also the principal source of new information&#13;
that can be used to refine or reject project concepts and generate new, more appropriate ones.&#13;
Thus, in this type of project, monitoring for learning is even more important than monitoring for&#13;
assessment.&#13;
Monitoring Objectives and Project Context&#13;
2.  The institutional context of the proposed project is both a major challenge and a major&#13;
opportunity. The impact of the project will depend on the successful creation of new institutions,&#13;
redefinition of existing institutions, and both the creation and modification of relationships between&#13;
old and new institutions. The project will involve a matrix of institutions from the public and&#13;
private sectors, NGOs and civil society. Target beneficiaries are homeowners, who participate in&#13;
the project through new homeowners' associations. These will ultimately be served by a new&#13;
advocacy/service entity, an association of homeowners' associations. The Ministry of Construction&#13;
and Urban Development (MCUD) will play catalytic and oversight roles to set, oversee and&#13;
implement new housing sector policies. Banks will serve new clients in new ways, as will&#13;
contractors.&#13;
3.  Similarly, relationships will change. Currently, most interactions between institutions, and&#13;
between institutions and individuals are hierarchical, ad hoc, and monopolistic, manifesting strong&#13;
patron/client arrangements. Through the project, relationships between institutions and individuals&#13;
in the housing sector will become more transparent, accountable and systematic, based on supplier/&#13;
consumer partnerships that reflect both vested interests and interdependencies, as well as informed&#13;
choice. Project monitoring will track the creation and reorientation of institutions and relationships,&#13;
and the impact of such changes on project implementation and the lives of intended beneficiaries.&#13;
4.  Under the proposed project there are eight specific project objectives to monitor, one&#13;
anticipated impact and one condition for effective implementation. The objectives are measurable&#13;
outcomes to which specific project interventions are directed:&#13;
(a)    Reduction in heating cost for homeowners&#13;
(b)    Strengthened self-management in buildings (homeowners' associations)&#13;
(c)    Increased access for homeowners to technical information&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -                                 Annex 8&#13;
(d)    Information on energy to be saved through energy efficiency rehabilitation in schools&#13;
(e)    Reduced transaction costs for credit and residential improvements&#13;
(f)    Increased client orientation (amongst banks, officials, contractors, consultants)&#13;
(g)    Increased transparency in credit and contracting (through standardization and accountability)&#13;
(h)    Increased private sector contractor demand and quality.&#13;
5.  Energy saving investments may not be affordable to all residents in some buildings. If the&#13;
majority of homeowners in their building nevertheless wants to invest in energy efficiency&#13;
improvements, some homeowners may choose to relocate to more affordable accommodations. An&#13;
indirect impact of the project may thus be:&#13;
(a)    Market-based residential readjustment&#13;
6.  Finally, effective implementation of the project will require increased coordination among a&#13;
number of institutional stakeholders, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Construction&#13;
and Urban Development, Ministry of Energy, municipalities, banks, contractors, and others. A&#13;
project implementation mechanism that should be monitored is therefore:&#13;
(a)    Increased coordination among housing-related institutions.&#13;
Project Monitoring Overview&#13;
7.  Project monitoring will systematically gather data that can be used to measure changes in the&#13;
areas listed above, as well as to identify problems that impede progress. The monitoring program&#13;
will thus serve both the ongoing monitoring needs of project management and the periodic&#13;
stocktaking and evaluation needs of various stakeholders. Above all, the approach will provide a&#13;
practical learning tool to aid in the design of a larger follow-on project.&#13;
8.  Monitoring techniques will include household socio-economic surveys, participant observation&#13;
and simple, unobtrusive record-keeping. The monitoring will involve a range of stakeholders both&#13;
as subjects and recipients of the data. Basic institutional monitoring will occur throughout the&#13;
project period, expanding in coverage as project activities increase in number and location.&#13;
Household and impact monitoring will be conducted on a rolling basis, including new stakeholders&#13;
when they are drawn into the project and maintaining contact thereafter.&#13;
9.  Monitoring will be managed by staff in the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), utilizing three&#13;
primary mechanisms: first, participating institutions, which will periodically provide information&#13;
regarding their operations; second, staff in the PCU who will be responsible for most of the&#13;
qualitative data-gathering and follow-up to obtain standard records from various institutions, as well&#13;
as analysis and reporting; and third, a part-time survey team will be engaged to conduct household&#13;
surveys in buildings as they join the program (Baseline Survey), as well as periodic follow-up&#13;
surveys to obtain information about different processes and to assess satisfaction levels and impact.&#13;
These Milestone Surveys will be conducted at the time the loan is requested, when it is granted,&#13;
when tendering is compieted and when the work is completed. The team can be mobilized from&#13;
Universities or one of the local research firms. The head of the survey team, who serves as a&#13;
technical advisor to the PCU, will prepare data gathering and analysis strategies, mobilize interview&#13;
teams, enter and process the data, and analyze results. Questionnaires will be simple, standardized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -                                 Annex 8&#13;
instruments that can be used repeatedly, both capturing new entrants in the program and&#13;
establishing periodic follow-up interviews to use comparatively to assess impact and identify trends.&#13;
Monitoring Project Objectives and Anticipated Outcomes&#13;
10.  This section describes in more detail the anticipated specific objectives and outcomes of the&#13;
project and how they will be monitored. Each will be described in terms of the stakeholders to be&#13;
affected, the dimension observed, indicator to be monitored, data source, data collection method&#13;
and the frequency and timing of data-gathering.&#13;
11.  Reduce Heating Cost. The most tangible benefit of the project should be a decrease in&#13;
heating use and the reduction of heating costs to homeowners, individually and collectively, and to&#13;
school administrations. The indicator is the amount of heat obtained during the winter months,&#13;
shown in heating bills. The data can be obtained routinely from schools and from Homeowners'&#13;
associations, as well as a sample of homeowners in large buildings. Data should be gathered at the&#13;
beginning of involvement in the project, as part of the baseline interview, and collected quarterly&#13;
thereafter. Homeowner sampling should be strategic, to assess the relative impact on low floors&#13;
and high floors, and from exposed and relatively unexposed areas, if appropriate. The data should&#13;
be prepared for annual comparisons on a building-by-building basis, as well as on the basis of&#13;
location and household vs. Association changes, adjusted for tariff increases, as they occur, as well&#13;
as the relative severity of the weather.&#13;
12.  Strengthen Self-Management. The project will strengthen homeowners' associations directly,&#13;
by providing information, management advice and technical support, and indirectly by providing&#13;
the opportunity to fulfill maintenance and upgrading responsibilities. Monitoring will focus on the&#13;
homeowners' associations, based on the qualitative inputs of involved PCU staff, as well as&#13;
quantitative indicators. Through periodic contacts, PCU staff will chart changes in the structure&#13;
and function of associations, looking at patterns of membership on the association board (is&#13;
membership opening up?), communication patterns between the board and households (is the flow&#13;
of information back and forth between board members and households increasing in quantity and&#13;
quality?), increase or decrease of responsibilities (does the association have new responsibilities or&#13;
has it reduced its work load?), and levels of satisfaction (do homeowners have more confidence in&#13;
the board?). The number of indicators is expected to expand during early project stages and then&#13;
decrease, as some are found to be more robust than others. PCU staff will draft a brief annual&#13;
report on each association, as well as identify trends that emerge from a comparative analysis of&#13;
associations over time.&#13;
13.  Once an association takes a loan through the project, and the work is completed, the strength&#13;
of an association can be measured by two indicators: increasing investment--taking a second or&#13;
third loan; and enforcing cost recovery. On an annual basis, the Liaison Officer will report on the&#13;
number of associations that take a second loan and changes in the average time lapsed between first&#13;
and subsequent loans, both of which are indicators of the confidence and effectiveness of&#13;
associations; and the level of cost recovery achieved, which is an indicator of the strength of the&#13;
association. We would expect to see the number of multiple loans increase over time, the time&#13;
between loans decrease, and cost recovery levels increase.&#13;
14.  Increase Access to Technical Information. Participating banks, the Ministry of Construction&#13;
and Urban Development and the Homeowners' association Advisory Services will each prepare and&#13;
disseminate technical material that is intended to help associations make investment decisions and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                                   Annex 8&#13;
plan and implement the investment process. On an annual basis, each institution will provide data&#13;
to the Liaison Officer regarding the number of flyers, brochures, booklets and the like that it&#13;
produces, as well as the number it disseminates and patterns of dissemination. On the consumer&#13;
side, data will also be gathered regarding the extent to which publications reach associations and&#13;
households. Each association that expresses an interest in the program will be asked to complete a&#13;
Baseline Survey, one element of which will focus on the number and types of publications available&#13;
to the association. Similarly, sample households who will also be interviewed at the same time will&#13;
be asked about their familiarity with technical materials. These data will be reported on an annual&#13;
basis, in aggregate. In addition, a before-and-after comparison will be made within each&#13;
association, comparing the level of information available at first contact compared to the level upon&#13;
completion of the work, and identifying sources of the materials. The association and household&#13;
surveys are expected both to stimulate demand for technical materials and to indicate changes in&#13;
access to the materials over time.&#13;
15.  Reduce Transaction Costs. Improved procedures and increased access to information should&#13;
speed up three processes which are currently either very lengthy, uncertain or risky: deciding to&#13;
invest in improvements; obtaining the loan; and completing the work satisfactorily. In each case,&#13;
the focus is on the costs incurred by associations, either direct cost or indirect losses of time. The&#13;
prime indicators are the amount of time and direct cost required at three points in the process. The&#13;
Liaison Officer will request each association to record major events and provide data to answer&#13;
three questions:&#13;
(a)    how much time elapsed between the association's initial inquiry about the program and the&#13;
decision to proceed with a specific investment program?&#13;
(b)    how much time elapsed between the association's decision to invest and the bank's decision&#13;
to grant a loan, how many steps were required and what direct and indirect costs were&#13;
involved in going through the steps of the program?&#13;
(c)    how much time elapsed between approval of the loan and completion of the work?&#13;
16.  Data will be aggregated and reported on an annual basis to identify changing patterns in each&#13;
of the three discrete areas, as well as in the overall process.&#13;
17.  Establish a Client-Centered Orientation in Participating Institutions. If the project is&#13;
successful, homeowners' associations and other institutions will develop new perceptions and new&#13;
interaction patterns. Associations will see the other institutions (the Ministry, banks, consultants&#13;
and contractors) as partners and collaborators, rather than unapproachable or predatory&#13;
organizations; and the institutions will see the associations as clients whose interests and rights are&#13;
to be protected and respected, because of mutual interest. Data in this regard will relate primarily&#13;
to levels of satisfaction from the point of view of the associations. The initial Baseline Survey for&#13;
each participating association will assess perceptions regarding the responsiveness, effectiveness and&#13;
accessibility of each of the institutions. Subsequent Milestone Surveys, executed for each&#13;
association at points of making the decision, obtaining the loan and completing the work will also&#13;
assess satisfaction. A satisfaction profile will be developed for each association, which will be&#13;
aggregated and compared, to identify annual trends, as well as satisfaction levels with each&#13;
institution. A simple satisfaction scale will be developed to permit comparisons over time. These&#13;
data will be supplemented and embellished by qualitative data obtained in periodic inquiries by the&#13;
Liaison Officer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                                 Annex 8&#13;
18.  Increase Standardization. Transparency and Accountability. As part of their participation in&#13;
the project, institutions will be required to develop simple, clear procedures for completing their&#13;
tasks. The Ministry will establish clear, simple guidelines for participation; banks will prepare&#13;
standardized loan application forms that are clear, intelligible and self-explanatory; contractors will&#13;
prepare equally clear and simple proposals, cost estimates and accounting procedures. Each of&#13;
these institutions is also expected to improve the quality of their guidelines, applications, proposals&#13;
and other forms and formats, as they gain experience and obtain feedback. The PCU will maintain&#13;
contacts with each institution to provide feedback and record changes in procedures or forms.&#13;
These will be reported on an annual basis, indicating the numbers and types of modifications&#13;
introduced during the year. Follow-up surveys and qualitative inquiries by the PCU will document&#13;
changes in the amount of time required to fill in various forms and review proposals, for example,&#13;
as well as the perceived ease of doing so. This will be reported informally as ideas for&#13;
improvements emerge and more formally on an annual basis, with specific recommendations for&#13;
each participating institution.&#13;
19.  Increase Private Sector Contractor Demand and Ouality. Homeowners' associations are&#13;
expected to constitute a significant demand for contractors through the project, and their individual&#13;
and collective demands are expected to improve the quality of the work that is done. The principal&#13;
indicators of success are increased volume of work and increased levels of satisfaction. On an&#13;
annual basis, participating contractors will inform the PCU of the amount of work obtained through&#13;
the project. This information will be verified by associations and reported in an annual report that&#13;
compares the number of contractors involved and the volume of business over time. At the&#13;
completion of each job, associations and homeowners will be surveyed to determine their relative&#13;
satisfaction with the work that has been done, as well as to highlight problems that occurred and the&#13;
response of the contractors. This data will also be aggregated by the PCU, supplemented by&#13;
informal discussions and inquiries, and reported annually to determine trends and identify areas of&#13;
that need attention.&#13;
20.  Market-based Residential Readiustment. The privatization of housing in Lithuania has&#13;
resulted in a number of misalignments between family size and housing size and increasingly, as&#13;
energy prices have risen precipitously, growing disparities between heating costs and ability to pay.&#13;
Although associations and individuals have apparently helped each other overcome the impact of&#13;
such misalignments, the investments made by homeowners' associations through the project,&#13;
combined with strict cost-recovery requirements, may over-extend these informal buffering&#13;
mechanisms, making it necessary for some families to find more affordable housing. In order to&#13;
monitor the situation, and to prepare mitigation plans, if appropriate, a PCU Officer will keep track&#13;
of household movement and interview each household to ascertain reasons for moving, the causal&#13;
sequence, destination, and particular issues that arose in the decision to move as well as the process&#13;
of relocation and relative conditions in the new site. This issue will be reported annually,&#13;
identifying causes, procedures and concerns, as well as identifying promising areas of intervention,&#13;
if appropriate, to ease the transition.&#13;
21.  Increased Coordination Among Participating Institutions. Experience to date has&#13;
demonstrated how critical it is for participating institutions to coordinate their efforts and harmonize&#13;
their approaches in order to meet the needs of homeowners efficiently and effectively, as well as to&#13;
meet their own needs. Although the project implementation structure offers a mechanism to&#13;
facilitate coordination and harmonization, the issue will also be monitored more specifically on an&#13;
annual basis. Each participant will prepare an annual report that describes their coordination efforts&#13;
and identifies points in the interface between that institution and others that needs attention. Each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84-                                     Annex 8&#13;
institution (the Ministry, banks, contractors, homeowners advisory services, and the Association of&#13;
Homeowners' associations) will establish its own method for gathering ideas and reporting. At the&#13;
same time, on a semi-annual basis, the Liaison Officer will contact homeowners' associations to&#13;
identify weaknesses in coordination mechanisms and areas of slippage, as well as recommended&#13;
actions to be taken. This semi-annual report will provide feedback both to the project as a whole&#13;
and to participating institutions.&#13;

11. DETAILED PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
1.  All civil works and consulting services to be financed with Bank loan funds will be procured&#13;
in accordance with the relevant Bank procurement guidelines. The Project Procurement Plan&#13;
(attached) details procurement packages, mode of procurement and schedules. Procurement of&#13;
bilateral or donor financed components of the project will follow the bilateral donor's procurement&#13;
procedures.&#13;
Rehabilitation and Renovation of Apartment Buildings and Apartments/Single Family Homes&#13;
2.  Procurement for each privately-owned multifamily building and single family home&#13;
participating in the project will be undertaken by the concerned homeowners' association (HOA) or&#13;
homeowner, according to the World Bank's guidelines for procurement for loans through financial&#13;
intermediaries to the private sector. The cost of civil works for individual contracts will mostly&#13;
range from approximately US$5,000 to US$150,000. They shall be procured under lump sum,&#13;
fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of written quotations obtained from three qualified&#13;
contractors.&#13;
3.  The energy savings improvements for multifamily apartment buildings and apartments/single&#13;
family homes will be procured as civil works only; goods will be procured by contractors under the&#13;
civil works contracts. Such contracts may include: (a) supply and installation of equipment (heat&#13;
exchangers for heating system and domestic hot water, automatic control systems, temperature&#13;
control equipment such as pressure regulators, flow rate regulators, mechanical valves governed by&#13;
temperature sensors, water flow meters, balancing valves, circulating pumps, thermostatic radiator&#13;
valves, prefabricated substation equipment, etc.); (b) supply and installation of goods (windows,&#13;
construction materials such as roofing and insulation, etc.); and (c) installation and construction&#13;
works (e.g. tightening of windows, doors, sealing of wall joints, refurbishing of windows, doors,&#13;
insulation and renovation of roof or construction of new roof including pitched roof, insulation of&#13;
walls, fine tuning of heating system, etc.).&#13;
4.  The residential component is expected to cover approximately 200-300 multifamily apartment&#13;
buildings and single/dual family homes. This is expected to involve about 300-500 short term&#13;
single responsibility contracts for a total amount of about US$15.4 million. Sub-borrowers will&#13;
decide whether to assemble the work into one or more contract packages, e.g., by category of&#13;
work, such as mechanical systems, and major or minor building improvements. The contracts are&#13;
expected to take about 3 to 6 weeks for completion from the day of commencement of works,&#13;
however, some imported equipment and materials would have a maximum lead time of 4 weeks.&#13;
Construction of a new roof could take up to 2 months.&#13;
5.  On the basis of current experience in Lithuania, the expected contracts are deemed to be too&#13;
small and scattered both geographically and over time (4 years) to interest foreign contractors&#13;
unless they are already established in Lithuania, but international firms would not be precluded&#13;
from participation. As private sector entities, homeowners and homeowners' associations will&#13;
select contractors. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will in collaboration with the Ministry for&#13;
Construction and Urban Development (MCUD) provide sub-borrowers with a list of contractors&#13;
registered with MCUD under an existing contractor registration/certification process. The objective&#13;
of the list will be to maximize competition while protecting the consumer, and to ensure that new,&#13;
small firms satisfying predefined criteria will be given opportunities to compete for civil works&#13;
financed by the project. Contractors will be reviewed according to customary civil works standards&#13;
&#13;

regarding experience, technical and financial capability, payment terms and guarantees.&#13;
Homeowners and homeowners' associations will be able to obtain guidance from energy consultants&#13;
on the best procedures for their particular investments. The participating commercial banks will&#13;
review and approve: (a) the contractors selected by the homeowner or homeowners' association&#13;
prior to issuance of the written invitation to quote; and (b) the proposed decision to award contract,&#13;
prior to execution.&#13;
Rehabilitation and Renovation of Schools&#13;
6.  For the schools component, procurement of works and services for energy saving&#13;
improvements financed under the Bank loan for up to 20 schools in selected municipalities will be&#13;
undertaken by the respective municipality in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
The civil works (including equipment, goods and installation and construction services ) will be&#13;
similar to those detailed in paragraph 3 above for multi-family apartment buildings. Contracts&#13;
numbering 15 to 30 at a cost ranging from US$50,000 to US$400,000 will be awarded on the basis&#13;
of NCB and by using the Bank's Regional NCB Sample Bidding Documents for Small Works, as&#13;
modified with the Bank's approval. Municipalities will decide whether to assemble the work into&#13;
one or more contract packages, e.g., by category of work mentioned in paragraph 4 above. Works&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent shall be procured under lump sum, fixed price&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of written quotations obtained from three qualified contractors in&#13;
response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works,&#13;
including basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to&#13;
the Bank, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who&#13;
offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources&#13;
to successfully complete the contract. On the basis of current experience in Lithuania, these&#13;
contracts are deemed to be too small and scattered both geographically and over time (3 years) to&#13;
interest foreign contractors unless they are already established in Lithuania, but international firms&#13;
would not be precluded from participation.&#13;
7.  Each municipality will undertake its own procurement. A commission in each municipality&#13;
will advertise the tender, evaluate bids and make recommendation for award of contracts. Contract&#13;
awards will be made to the bidder substantially responsive to the bidding document and who offers&#13;
the lowest evaluated cost to the municipality. Municipal housing maintenance companies (about 24&#13;
such companies exist in Vilnius) cannot participate in the Bank-financed procurement as they are&#13;
not legally and financially autonomous and do not operate under commercial law.&#13;
8.  The Ministry of Economy has prepared a draft "Law on State Procurement" which will be&#13;
introduced in Parliament and possibly enacted into law in 1996. Present Government regulations&#13;
permit the use of the Bank's Guidelines and Standard Bidding Documents for public procurement&#13;
made with Bank financing.&#13;

12. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. FRAMEWORK FOR CALCULATION OF ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN&#13;
1.   Economic analysis was carried out to examine the viability of individual investments and their&#13;
consequences for the economy as a whole. The main tangible benefit consists of energy savings.&#13;
Other tangible benefits are the improvement in the building stock, increased comfort and health for the&#13;
inhabitants, environmental improvements and intangibles as discussed above. For the economy as a&#13;
whole, tangible benefits will derive from resource savings, evaluated as the reduction in the economy's&#13;
consumption of natural gas, mazut and other fossil fuels that are imported.' For the individual&#13;
homeowners who invest in energy efficiency rehabilitation, benefits will derive from savings on their&#13;
heating bill, the amount of which will vary in size according to specific 'package' chosen by them.2&#13;

2.   Which specific measures will be undertaken in any particular building will depend on the decision&#13;
of the respective homeowner(s) and therefore on their preferences and incomes. The analysis&#13;
presented here is based on technical assessments of 14 apartment buildings, one single-family home&#13;
and one school. For the purpose of the following analysis, three 'packages' were assumed (A, B, and&#13;
C) which combine various measures as follows: A= Heat Meter + Temperature Control + Heat&#13;
System  Balancing + Stair Case Improvement + Pipe Insulation; B= A+ Basement Insulation +&#13;
Window Improvement; C= A+ Basement Insulation + Roof Insulation + Window Change (see&#13;
examples in Table 1 and Table 2). These packages require, per apartment, investments of LT 350 to&#13;
I       Fuel savings resulting from investments under this project will not be large, since the total loan amount is relatively&#13;
small - corresponding to the pilot character of the project - and will result in energy efficiency rehabilitations for relatively&#13;
few buildings in Lithuania (approximately 250 apartment buildings and 12 schools).&#13;
2        Alternatively, higher comfort could be achieved with the same heat bill as before. In this case, savings will derive&#13;
from a reduction in the use of additional heating systems. About 16% of households in urban areas currently use additional&#13;
heaters such as electric heaters to complement the insufficient temperatures provided by the DH system (see Annex 1 for a&#13;
survey on consumer behavior and attitudes). With better insulation households will no longer have to use these devices.&#13;
resulting in (possibly even additional) energy savings.&#13;

LT 6,000 in large buildings (60-100 apartments) and LT 670 to LT 10,500 in small buildings (12-40&#13;
apartments). Rehabilitation measures in single-family homes will most likely be more expensive (e.g.&#13;
between LT 10,000 and 40,000). Further technical details can be found in Annex 3.&#13;
3.   About $13.9 million will be available to invest in energy conservation measures in apartment&#13;
buildings, all of them supplied by district heat (DH). A maximum of 10% of $15.4 million available&#13;
for the residential rehabilitation component can be lent to owners of single-family homes. For the&#13;
renovation of school buildings an amount of $2.3 million is allocated. It is assumed that the loan will&#13;
be disbursed within 4 years (1997-2000).&#13;

4.   The project costs consist of the equipment for building renovation plus labor cost for installment.&#13;
Since investment decisions are made by individual homeowners and their associations the exact amount&#13;
and timing of investment cannot be determined with certainty. For the base case, it is assumed that&#13;
60% of households will opt for package A, 30% for package B and 10% for package C. With respect&#13;
to the timing of the investment, it is assumed that 6% of investment will take place in year 1, 27% in&#13;
year 2, 32 % in year 3, and 35 % in year 4. The exact shares of foreign and local components cannot&#13;
be determined ex ante. Most materials are now available in Lithuania, at lower prices than comparable&#13;
foreign materials. Prices of capital goods as well as heat tariffs are as of October 1995 (heating season&#13;
1995/1996). While prices of capital goods are assumed constant in real terms, heat tariffs are assumed&#13;
to increase to reach full cost-recovery level before the heating season 1997/1998 and to be constant in&#13;
real terms thereafter.&#13;
5.   Energy savings constitute the main tangible benefit and are the basis on which the economic&#13;
analysis has been conducted. As a consequence of their investment, homeowners will also benefit from&#13;
an increase in the value of their apartment. This increase would enter the calculation of the financial&#13;
rate of return as an additional benefit as far as the increase is not derived from the lower energy bill&#13;
but from lower maintenance cost and reduced occurrence of leaks and other damage that may arise due&#13;
&#13;

to insufficient heating and insulation.3 Other benefits are increased comfort and health for the&#13;
inhabitants, environmental improvements and intangibles such as the stimulation of private initiative in&#13;
housing and maintenance in general, support for the private sector building industry and contributions&#13;
to the creation of a market for long-term loans. Neither those nor other, tangible or intangible&#13;
benefits, have been quantified for the analysis below as the rates of return that were calculated solely&#13;
on the basis of energy savings are already substantial.&#13;
(a)    Savingsfor the economy: In this project, energy savings are calculated as resource savings for&#13;
the economy as a whole. Energy efficiency improvements would translate into savings for the&#13;
economy primarily through reduced consumption of natural gas, mazut and other fossil fuels&#13;
that need not be imported. De facto, fuel savings resulting from investments under this project&#13;
will not be large, since the total loan amount is relatively small - corresponding to the pilot&#13;
character of the project - and will result in energy efficiency rehabilitation's for relatively few&#13;
buildings in Lithuainia (approximately 200 apartment buildings and 10-20 schools). Additional&#13;
energy savings will arise from a reduction in the use of additional heating systems which are&#13;
currently employed by about 16% of urban households in order to increase levels of comfort.&#13;
With better insulation households will no longer have to use these devices and will therefore be&#13;
able to save energy. Unfortunately, information on the magnitude of energy used by those&#13;
additional heating devices does not exist; therefore savings could not be quantified.&#13;
(b)    Savings for homeowners: For the individual homeowners investment in energy efficiency&#13;
rehabilitation will result in financial savings, the magnitude of which will vary in size&#13;
according to the specific 'packages'. After energy efficiency rehabilitations have been&#13;
undertaken, homeowners will pay less for the same comfort level. Alternatively, higher&#13;
comfort could be achieved with the same heat bill as before. Investment in energy efficiency&#13;
will also increase the market value of the apartment by lowering maintenance cost, reducing&#13;
the occurrence of leaks, and other damage due to insufficient heating and insulation. The&#13;
quantification of the increase in value has not been attempted here due to the thinness of the&#13;
real estate market in Lithuania.&#13;
Evaluation of Benefits&#13;
6.   Energy savings achieved through the proposed project have been calculated on the basis of a&#13;
reduction in (a) the cost of delivering energy due to falling demand, and (b) the heat billings received&#13;
by homeowners from their respective suppliers (see also para. 9 below).&#13;
(a)    The reduction in the costfor the delivery of heat has been valued on the basis of the variable&#13;
fuel cost of the district heating system, natural gas and mazut and on the basis of natural gas&#13;
prices for single-family homes. The border prices of these two fuels are very close to world&#13;
market prices, $90/1000m3 for gas and $96/ton for mazut.4 Taking into account conversion&#13;
efficiency, fuel mix in the district heating system and losses in the district heating transmission&#13;
and distribution system of about 25 percent, the average heat cost is $17.2 per gcal, equivalent&#13;
to LTO.08 per kWh (see Table 3). It should be noted that, in the long-term, when heat demand&#13;
decreases due to energy savings, not only variable fuel costs will decline, but also the need to&#13;
3      The quantification of the increase in value is difficult because real estate markets are only beginning to function in&#13;
Lithuania. It may be possible, however, to impute the value of a renovated apartment by taking into account its reduced&#13;
energy and maintenance expenditures.&#13;

account in the analysis, but is dealt with in the sensitivity analysis as a higher value of heat.&#13;
For single-family homes heated directly with natural gas, the relevant opportunity cost is the&#13;
border price of natural gas (see row 2 in Table 5); for a long-term perspective, capital cost for&#13;
the rehabilitation of the distribution networks would have to be added.&#13;

(b)     The reduction in the billing for heating is calculated separating between billings for apartment&#13;
buildings and schools and billings for single family homes. Apartment buildings and schools&#13;
are overwhelmingly connected to district heat. For the financial analysis, energy savings have&#13;
been valued with the applicable district heating tariff. Assuming a 60% level of cost recovery&#13;
in the 1995/96 heating season, and an increase in heat tariffs to the full cost level within the&#13;
next three years, will lead to heat tariffs as in the first two rows of Table 4. Since the&#13;
economic cost of delivered heat (third row) only includes variable elements for the reasons&#13;
stated above, it is below the financial, full cost tariff.&#13;

Single-family homes in Lithuania use various fuels: in Vilnius and Kaunas, heating with natural&#13;
gas has the biggest market share with about 40%. Although households may use other fuels&#13;
such as electricity or fuelwood at the same time, for the purpose of this analysis, heat savings&#13;
of single-family homeowners were valued at natural gas cost. For the financial analysis, it is&#13;
based on the tariff of LT 0.05/kWh. Currently, this does not cover the distribution cost. As&#13;
with district heat, it is assumed that a full cost tariff, equal to 0.067 LT/kWh, will be charged&#13;
starting in 1998 (see Table 5).&#13;

Rates of Return&#13;
7.   For the purpose of assessing the profitability of energy efficiency rehabilitation investments, 14&#13;
apartment buildings, one single-family home and one school were carefully assessed. For each&#13;
building the measures proposed by the respective homeowners' association or the owners were&#13;
evaluated and ranked according to their payback.&#13;
8.   Net benefits have been calculated comparing cash flows with and without the project. For the&#13;
financial analysis it is assumed that district heating tariffs will increase to the expected cost recovery&#13;
level of LT 0. 119/kWh from the current level of LT 0.072/kWh within the next three years, resulting&#13;
in rising costs to the individual household (see Table 4). The same assumption was made for the case&#13;
of the single-family; prices for natural gas are assumed to be charged at full cost recovery level of LT&#13;
0.0668 by 1998 (see Table 5). For the economic analysis, a VAT of 18% was deducted from the cost&#13;
of works and goods. Import duties ranging between 10% and 15% were not included. Energy savings&#13;
for the economy were valued with the opportunity costs of energy, primarily natural gas and mazut for&#13;
the generation of district heat and natural gas for heating of single-family homes (see para. 6 (a)&#13;
above).&#13;

9.   For each building type, investments were grouped into packages A, B, and C and Rates of Return&#13;
(RRs) were calculated for "mixed" packages. The economic RRs calculated for rehabilitation measures&#13;
in the various buildings vary according to building in a range from 2% to 56%, given the above stated&#13;
assumptions. The RRs for the entire investment for energy efficiency rehabilitations in apartment&#13;
buildings were computed as a weighted average of the individual building type RRs (see Table 6 for&#13;
the weightings).&#13;
10.   For the calculation of the overall project RRs, the average RRs of the three investment&#13;
components were weighted, according to the allocation of project funds (see Table 2.1 in Section 2).&#13;
Quantifying only the expected energy savings results, under the stated assumptions, results in a&#13;
Financial Rate of Return (FRR) for the whole project of 31.2% and an Economic Rate of Return (ERR)&#13;
for the whole project of 25.9%. The difference between the economic rate of return and the financial rate&#13;
of return is very small since the economic valuation captures only savings in variable fuel costs. Only in the&#13;
long-terrn or with a considerable bigger investment would savings in other variable costs and in capital cost&#13;
materialize. Those long-term effects as well as the demonstration effect associated with the activities&#13;

* The assumptions for the Base Case are: Equipment cost and energy savings according to technical assessments, heat tariffs&#13;
to reach full cost recovery level by the end of 1997, and equipment quantity according to assumptions in para. 2&#13;
Project Risks and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
11.  The project risks taken into account in the sensitivity analysis include: (a) heat tariffs; (b)&#13;
magnitude of energy savings; (c) cost for labor and materials; and (d) implementation risks. The&#13;
Government plans to increase the tariffs to full cost recovery level by the end of 1997. If this level is&#13;
not reached or later eroded by inflation, investment payback time and financial rate of return (FRR)&#13;
will be negatively affected, whereas the economic rate of return (ERR) will remain unchanged as&#13;
resource cas, and not heat tariffs, are the basis for the calcuation of savings to the economy (see Tables&#13;
8 and 9). The magnituted of savings may be higher or lower than envisaged, depending on the types&#13;
of investments undertaken by homeowners. The exact composition of the investment packages is&#13;
uncertain and can only be confirmed during project implementation. The choice of any specific&#13;
investment package will determine the investment cost as well as the resulting energy savings. The&#13;
magnitude of savings may also be higher or lower than envisaged as, while the design of buildings is&#13;
more or less uniform and design values are well known, in reality building materials and construction&#13;
are not always according to design. Cost for labor and materials may be different to current estimates&#13;
since building renovation, especially with a view towards improving energy efficiency, is a novelty in&#13;
Eastern Europe and, therefore, cost estimates for local materials and skilled local labor are uncertain.&#13;
Finally, the behavior of inhabitants has a big impact on the ultimate realization of energy savings.&#13;
Compared to the current situation with some apartments heated at below normal heat levels, the&#13;
inhabitants of a renovated building may decide to increase temperatures rather than save energy. All&#13;
of these factors may result in achieving less or more savings than assumed in the analysis and could&#13;
negatively impact on the project's rate of return.&#13;
12.  Overall, Rates of Return generated by the project remain well above the 15% threshold for most&#13;
of the simulated changes in parameters (for results of the sensitivity analysis, see Tables 8 and 9). An&#13;
increase in equipment cost does not appear to affect the project's viability as much as decreases in&#13;
energy savings: A cost increase of 50% would decrease total project returns (ERR) from 26% to 15%.&#13;
If actual energy savings were below the originally assumed level (50% less) then project returns (ERR)&#13;
drop to only 10%. If households would decide to invest in more expensive packages, including&#13;
measures with a longer payback time, the rates of return would also be reduced.&#13;
(a)    Apartment buildings: As can be seen from Tables 8 and 9, an increase in equipment cost of&#13;
20% will decrease rates of return to 25%  and 20% for FRR and ERR, respectively. If heat&#13;
tariffs were to remain fixed, and therfore not to rise to full cost recovery, this would reduce&#13;
the FRR significantly but still leave it at 18%. Lower than expected energy savings would&#13;
have the most dramatic effect on the viability of the project. If energy savings were 50%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                                  Annex 12&#13;
lower than expected, FRR and ERR would be reduced to 13% and 10%, respectively. If&#13;
households would decide to invest in more expensive packages, including measures with a&#13;
longer payback time, rates of return would also be reduced. E.g. if only packages C were&#13;
chosen, the rates of return would drop to 9% for the FRR and 5% for the ERR. The results of&#13;
the sensitivity analysis for the rehabilitation of schools are similar to those presented for the&#13;
apartment buildings.&#13;
(b)    Single-family homes: Rehabilitation investment in these small buildings is both more expensive&#13;
and less profitable than in bigger apartment buildings and schools. The type of rehabilitation&#13;
investment and the resulting energy savings depend critically on the state of the efficiency of&#13;
the existing heat generation equipment. If the boiler has a low efficiency (as in this case),&#13;
rehabilitation measures have higher returns than in the case of a higher efficiency boiler. Rates&#13;
of return are much lower than the project average under all scenarios. The assessment of the&#13;
scope for energy savings in each individual building - which is to be part of every investment&#13;
proposal - is therefore of particular importance for single-family homes. Unless it can be&#13;
demonstrated that residential energy efficiency improvements will result in energy savings&#13;
significantly higher than assumed for this analysis, the share of investments in single-family&#13;
homes should not exceed 10% of the total lending volume.&#13;
13.  Iniclusion of long-term resource cost savings: If, in the long-term, rehabilitation in buildings&#13;
would result in substantial energy savings, this would have an impact on resource savings for the&#13;
economy. Variable cost savings other than fuel could be realized (e.g., O&amp;M, pumping, water&#13;
treatment), and both district heating and natural gas networks would need less rehabilitation and&#13;
replacement investment, and fewer heat generation plants would have to be rehabilitated. This would&#13;
increase the value of energy savings by about 20% for buildings heated with district heat and about&#13;
40% for natural gas, resulting in economic cost of delivered heat and gas, respectively, of 0.1 LT/kWh&#13;
and 0.067 LT/kWh. This, in turn, would significantly increase the economic rates of return, from an&#13;
average of 26% to 32%. Especially the single-family home component would benefit more than&#13;
doubling to 14%, compared to the base case.&#13;

13. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW&#13;
I    The Bank has determined that this project is a category "B" project for purposes of&#13;
environmental analysis. As a category "B" project, a limited analysis of specific environmental&#13;
impacts is required, but not a full environmental impact assessment (EIA). The project will finance&#13;
energy efficiency improvements for existing buildings only, and will therefore not involve new&#13;
construction except for the installation of new roofs, mechanical equipment and, in possibly a few&#13;
cases, new external wall insulation. No changes in land use, increased ground cover, alteration of&#13;
existing land form, vegetation or water systems, and no increases in residential density, will be&#13;
supported by the project. The Bank's Environmental Assessment Sourcebook' does not cover&#13;
environmental assessment of this situation, except indirectly insofar as (a) public health and safety&#13;
issues are present in any project involving construction. and (b) disposal of construction debris.&#13;
2.   Authority in Lithuania for environmental assessment of industrial and non-industrial&#13;
construction projects is with the Ministry of Environment's Division for Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment Control. Procedures of this office give it the authority to review the overall project, but&#13;
will not examine each sub-project individually. No formal environmental impact assessment (EIA)&#13;
is required under Lithuanian law for this project. Discussions indicate that this office welcomes the&#13;
project for its significant environmental benefits, and anticipates no negative impacts. According to&#13;
the Chief of the Division, their primary interest in the project will be to help publicize it in order to&#13;
broaden its impact as much as possible.&#13;
Environmental Benefits&#13;
3.      The environmental benefits of the project include: (a) reducing waste of non-renewable fuel&#13;
resources, particularly of fossil fuels, but also of nuclear-generated electric energy currently used to&#13;
supplement space heating; (b) a concomitant reduction in air pollutants'; and c) improving public&#13;
health by improving the control of residential ambient air and domestic hot water temperatures and&#13;
supply (including overheating), and reducing interior drafts and condensation. In addition, public&#13;
information/education, periodic energy audits, and homeowner association participation are&#13;
expected to help rationalize consumer behavior with regard to energy conservation and thereby&#13;
enhance long-term sustainability.&#13;
Potential Adverse Environmental Impacts&#13;
4.   The Bank has identified potentially hazardous building materials as the only environmental&#13;
issue needing to be addressed. This risk has two aspects: (a) the potential for disturbing hazardous&#13;
materials during the course of renovating existing buildings and the need for their safe handling and&#13;
disposal, and (b) the potential for improper use of new hazardous building materials. In this&#13;
EnvironmentalAssessmenr Sourcebook, 1991: Vol. II.&#13;
2       The pilot nature of the project and its resulting limited scale mean that pollutant reduction will be very limited. It&#13;
is the sustained application of energy conservation measures, in which this project is a first step--and the matching&#13;
pollutant reduction--that can lead in the longer term to measurable reductions. Atmospheric emissions reductions will&#13;
include nitrogen oxides (NO.), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CD2), from reduced consumption of natural gas&#13;
and fuel oil. A lower demand for supplemental space heating will reduce the use of electric space heaters, which in turn&#13;
will reduce demand for electric power, and pollutant/safety issues associated with generation. It also reduces the public&#13;
safety hazards associated with the use of ovens and stoves for supplemental space heating.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                                   Annex 13&#13;
regard, the Bank's and Government's primary concern involves asbestos insulation found on&#13;
existing piping in some older buildings. According to the Lithuanian State Public Health&#13;
("Hygiene") Center (PHC), lead-based paint is not a concern since its use has been restricted to&#13;
exterior, primarily marine, applications for several decades, and is not listed as a public health&#13;
problem by Lithuanian authorities. Mitigation of asbestos risk is discussed below.&#13;
5.   Lithuanian law provides for the certification of all building materials. Testing and certification&#13;
is the responsibility primarily of the PHC, but also includes government agencies for certain&#13;
specialized testing, suchi as fire hazard. Without certification, materials cannot be imported,&#13;
produced or transported in Lithuania.&#13;
6.  Indoor environmliental changes are not considered to be risks requiring mitigation. Where&#13;
existing (usually excessive) air infiltration is to be reduced through energy-saving measures,&#13;
technical specifications will ensure the possibility of ventilation adequate to maintain indoor air&#13;
quality (one-half to one air changes per hour). Disruption due to construction work will be&#13;
controlled by the owners and their consultants, as they will have client control over the contractor.&#13;
Local officers of the State Labor Inspectorate have the authority to oversee construction works on&#13;
behalf of laborers.&#13;
Asbestos&#13;
7.   Because of Lithuania's established certification program, which adequately covers the use of&#13;
potentially hazardous materials, the installation of new materials under the project will not present&#13;
hazard risks. The use of asbestos has been strictly regulated since 1993, and at present is restricted&#13;
under Lithuanian law to use in the manufacture of painted cement-asbestos roofing tiles and&#13;
underground water and drainage piping and wire conduits. According to Lithuanian public and&#13;
occupational health authorities, however, asbestos may be encountered in the form of pipe&#13;
insulation in older buildings. Site inspections by the project team confirm this. Risks are therefore&#13;
limited to the disturbance of existing asbestos that might require disposal when building heating&#13;
equipment is upgraded. Health risks encountered because of disturbed asbestos are considered to be&#13;
restricted primarily to construction workers. With proper handling and disposal, danger to building&#13;
tenants and the general public is not expected.&#13;
Plan for Asbestos Risk Mitigation&#13;
8.   Based on the potential risks outlined above, the project team has determined that a two-step&#13;
environmental risk mitigation procedure is required for the project to address asbestos pipe&#13;
insulation encountered in rehabilitation works financed under the project, namely identification and&#13;
handlinig and disposal.&#13;
9.  Identification of asbestos in the project will be effected through a process of certification by&#13;
owners' consultants, backed up by district labor inspection offices. Under this procedure, the&#13;
consultant will be required to certify the absence or presence of asbestos in each project; local&#13;
inspectors from the State Labor Inspectorate will support the consultants when there is doubt.&#13;
10.  Handlinig and disposal: Lithuania's Occupational Safety and Health regulations are in&#13;
transition and procedures covering asbestos handling have not yet been drafted. The only asbestos&#13;
procedures in place in the country at this time are those being used by district heating companies,&#13;
and are based on former Soviet norms. These have been reviewed and found to be adequate to meet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -                                 Annex 13&#13;
mitigationi requirements for handling and disposal. Where asbestos is certified to be present, the&#13;
respective contractor will be required through the civil works contract with the client to submit a&#13;
plan for handling and disposal of asbestos. The contractor's plan must be approved by the client,&#13;
based on Guidance will be provided by the Labor Inspectorate or the Municipal Center for Public&#13;
Health, as required. Institutional arrangements for this mitigation plan, including evaluation criteria&#13;
and methods to be applied during project supervision, will be finalized at Negotiations. Lithuanian&#13;
national norms and Public Health and Occupational Safety and Health procedures for asbestos&#13;
handlinig are being developed by a Government task force, and are expected to be established by&#13;
1997.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Energy Efficiency/Housing Pilot
            Project is a pilot and demonstration effort that aims to:
            (1) support and enable private initiative to improve
            residential energy efficiency; (2) support public initiative
            in improving energy efficiency in schools; and (3) support
            the implementation of Government policies to sustain the
            privatization of housing, enabling increased private
            initiative in housing maintenance in general. The project
            will consist of the following three components: (1) credit
            for residential energy efficiency rehabilitation, with
            incentives for homeowners to encourage participation; (2)
            energy efficiency rehabilitation of schools in selected
            municipalities; and (3) institutional development and
            strengthening, to be achieved through technical assistance
            that will: (a) facilitate project implementation, including
            setting up advisory centers for homeowners and homeowners
            associations, and (b) support further policy reform in
            demand side energy use and the energy and housing sectors in general.
