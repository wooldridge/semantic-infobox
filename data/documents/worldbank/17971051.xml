clifficultiea whiah were aare to u:iM after t1w war.&#13;
&amp;#12;     Oae of the permanent JDUibera of that   CJZ'O\IP   waa Lox'd&#13;
lCaynea, and I know very well that he, at that ti.IM, waa al-&#13;
ready very mueh interested in the aettin9 ap of an internation-&#13;
al bank. I heard later, when we vero in Waahin9ton, there&#13;
also vaa a group of people working on the Bank but the financial&#13;
expertâ&#128;¢ who came to Waahington were not yet conaulted on thia&#13;
point. But it waa always very 11lUGh in the ailld_ of the Ameri-&#13;
can Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Oa So, even in 1M3 you were awan of the fact that a bank&#13;
plan waa being diacuaaed but you had not yet a. .n any ckafta.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
de Iongha That â&#128;¢a perfectly true. Lol'cl X.ynea at that tiM&#13;
struggled very much with the idea of how the bank ahould be&#13;
financed, and I r._mber that ay friend, Dr. ..yen, and I&#13;
often bad diacuaaiona with X.ynea to that effect. I alao&#13;
beard, although I ayaelf waa not on that trip, that when the&#13;
Britiah caâ&#128;¢ over dtar1q the war, in '44, for the Bretton&#13;
WoocSa Conference, Xeynea had a draft with him on which there&#13;
were diacuaaiona every daf with the variotaa    ~pceaentativea        of&#13;
the govern.enta who   ~e   going to Bretton Woods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Qa I woader if yoa could tell a little bit about the Bretton&#13;
Wooda Confeceaoe itaelf.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
de Iongha Yea, Bretton   wooa,   of aourae, waa a very intereating&#13;
affau beeauH, although all the tiM, at       ~tiaal        aa.aata,&#13;
varioua interaational plana were diaeuaeed and even iaple. .nted.,&#13;
it had never been done on aucb a big acale aa waa the aaae in&#13;
Bretton Wooda.&#13;
&amp;#12;       8aw, of coarae, I'll ltait myaelf here to the Intâ&#128;¢r-&#13;
national Bank, and 1 may cite a few probl... that would         COM&#13;
&#13;
up. One of them waa the amount of money that coulâ&#128;¢ poaaibly&#13;
be raised in relationahip to the ea?ital of the Bank. The&#13;
original idea, if I'm well informed, of the united Stat8a,&#13;
waa that the amount stMauld be tuee timu the capital. 'fbia&#13;
waa con.idered to be very little by aoae_ of the foreip par-&#13;
ticipantâ&#128;¢, and I remember that the Poliah aallber... aaid to&#13;
. . that he had been thinking of aeven tiaea the capital.&#13;
       Of aourae, a gnat many of theae people didn't realise&#13;
how difficult it would be to 9et 8\J.Gh aaounta frOIIl the aarket&#13;
and whether the lllUket would look at tbe Bank aa a 90in9 aad&#13;
aafe concern. 'l'be Dutch delegation, atudyift9 the varioua q11etaa&#13;
of a number of -IIbera, caM to a very conaervative and, in the&#13;
opinion of aome of our c:olleaguea, a very disappointing con-&#13;
clusion, tba t one   CCM~lcln â&#128;¢ t   go futber than thi:H-quartera&#13;
of the capital. hvertheleaa, , . diacuaaecl thia Mtter with&#13;
the Britiah, aacl the Brlâ&#128;¢iab r1Â«)bt away vot very much in-&#13;
tereatecl. 'fbay cabled Lon4on and the renlt waa that the&#13;
Britiah tbeaaelvea tbou9ht that no         Â·~   tbaa 100 per cent o!&#13;
the capital could be taken up in the         â&#128;¢rnt.&#13;
       Tbat ia exaetl:r what happened. And ao, l think, that waa&#13;
the beat nault to be hacl, beeauae if it hacl beea three tbea&#13;
or â&#128;¢â&#128;¢vea tU.a t.M impxoeaaion in the aarket ce.-tainly WO\llcl&#13;
have been   diaaa~oua.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Qa   Bow did the Dutch bit upon the fi9ue ot         t~tera&#13;
&#13;
at the time?&#13;
&#13;
de Ionqba Aa you know, the capitalisation of the Bank ia aueh&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                de !Oft9h - 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
tbat 20 per ceat of the capital ia paid in by the Mmbera&#13;
( 2 per cent in gold and 18 per cent in their owa curenay) ,&#13;
while, for the remaining 80 per cent, they remain liable.&#13;
Thereby, theM 80 per c:ent aerve as a guarantee for the bcmd-&#13;
boldera. Well, so what we did vas juat to look at na.a of the&#13;
participatin9 .-.bera to form an opinion OD the aolvency&#13;
of auch countries, or at leaat on the iapceaai~ they would&#13;
malca on the market as reliable guarantora.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: In otber words, the Dutch felt that tbree-quartera of tbe&#13;
total capital       a~criptions       were aubacriptiona tbat tbe&#13;
Bank could really count on aa backift9 for ita bonda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
de longha &amp;xactly, tbatâ&#128;¢a what it vaa.&#13;
     However, in practice, the Dutch aad the Britiah proved&#13;
not conservative enough. I may tell aa an anecdote that wben&#13;
I later got into the aervice of the International Bank aa              ita&#13;
treaaurer and left the 9overnment aervice of the . .therlanda&#13;
Baat Indiea, a cUnner waa offered to â&#128;¢            by the iaatld. ilgqbouae&#13;
of the Hetherlanda In41ea gove&amp;"DMnt bona at wbiah tbey&#13;
invited a       n~       of other big 1aauift9 houaea. t'bere 1ils&#13;

be aaid to . . , when I told hill that the aaxiau of debta&#13;
outaaaa4t.at' would be equal to the capital, tbat that vaa far&#13;
too   ~~UCb ~   aDd that in praotice the public woulda â&#128;¢ t IMay aon&#13;
bonda than tbe amout that correaponded vitb the American&#13;
and the Canadian guazoan       t...   In fact, even tba t aaount baa not&#13;
been &amp;'eacbed yet. I alvaya thiDk it rather unaain9 that we&#13;
conaidered ouraelvea ao highlY conaervative1            OD   the contrary,&#13;
&amp;#12; we   wen fazo too optilliatic:.   It baa alwaya zo... ined a diaap-&#13;
pointmant fozo me that even after the vecy aucaeaaful operationâ&#128;¢&#13;
 of the lntezonational Bank actually the â&#128;¢rket ia only impzoeaaed&#13;
 by the 9uaranteea of the United ltatea plua canada and doean't&#13;
 aeem to take iato account the enoJ:mOUa value of the aaaeta&#13;
 of the Bank,. which the Bank baa, and 4aan' t Â·take into ac:c0\1nt&#13;
either that up to the â&#128;¢c:aent I'â&#128;¢ apealcing now, AufJWit, 1961,&#13;

fall of 1946.Â·&#13;

&#13;
de Iongb a    That â&#128;¢ a ri9ht.   I badn â&#128;¢ t beard of it before, and ao the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              de I0119h - 6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
fil'at tbin9 X did waa to go to Mr. Meyer, who waa a lao very&#13;
much aatoniabed by what Mr. Stanley had aaid. aut, aa I ean&#13;
aay now in 1961, Mr. Stanley ia atill right.&#13;
        When I went to the meeting in Savannah -       where the Bank&#13;
and i'und were founded -- one of the treat aontrov.raiea there&#13;
waa the queation of the executive directora, whether the&#13;
executive directorâ&#128;¢ ahould be a body aittinv. permanently,&#13;
would be in aeaaion permanently, all year rouftc.t., or would Â·con-&#13;
a tat of people, letâ&#128;¢a aay, very hivh officiala, of the varioua&#13;
governments who would      COI88   to Waahington, let 'a aay, once&#13;
every two JDOAtba., which with the air conaeationa would have&#13;
been quite poaaible.&#13;
     The fight waa eapec:ially aboQt the Pund, and I aa aay-&#13;
ing now, in the light of history, that it would have been ia-&#13;
poaaible for the l'und, where c.teaiaiona have to be taken at&#13;
very abort notice, and which deal moatly with matterâ&#128;¢ of&#13;
policy, to have a board of di.rectora which ia not alwaya&#13;
arou.n4.&#13;
        Xn the matter of the lnteZ"DAtional Baftk, I think it llitht&#13;
bave been poaaible that hi9b officials of Mllber governMnta&#13;
would   c~    over, let â&#128;¢a aay, onere eve.ry two aoatha, and â&#128;¢ke&#13;
policy cleciaioaa and then go back, au it WO\Ild even have&#13;

reaideat execNt&amp;ive direc:tora W011ld haM to 9et that infor-&#13;
mation by wiR     0&amp;' by   frequent via ita h - .&#13;
     Aa it tuned out, in the l'ud, the executive direetora&#13;
are far aon ccncemed with all aorta of pa-obl... of daily&#13;
aaana9ement than in the Bank. And I may aar hen that I â&#128;¢ve&#13;
alwaya regretted very muah that the relationahip between the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                              de IOft9h â&#128;¢ 7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bank aa4 the Fund waa not aore intt.ate.        It ia my own feelinq&#13;
that thia ia cauaed by the totally different poaition of the&#13;
executive directorâ&#128;¢ in the Bank and the l'lmd.       '-'he executive&#13;
direotora of the Bank are aore to be craapared with execnative&#13;
d~ectora     of a big company vbo deal with policy matterâ&#128;¢ and,&#13;
of aourae, one doeanâ&#128;¢t deal with aach polioy.mattera every&#13;
day.     'l'herefore, the poaition of lbe preaidant of the Bank&#13;
ia rather different frca the poaitiâ&#128;¢ of the        tene~al    â&#128;¢nater&#13;
of the l'llnci.&#13;
       Well, that' a how it baa tone.   I rather r8C)nt that it baa&#13;
gone that way becauae, after all, tbe two iaatitutiona deal&#13;
in principle with queatioaa, althOGgb they are different, tbat&#13;
have very auab aimilarity.     I atill hope that tbia aituatioa,&#13;
which baa I think already beec:a. aueh better, will a till&#13;
improve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Qa     Bow uout at the at.aff levela waa there in the early daya&#13;
aonaiderable contact betweea the     ~aeaEeb    ataffa of the Fund&#13;
and the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
de IOft9ht    Yea, there alwaya waa, lNt to ay Iliad not enCNgh.&#13;
Wbea, at the end of ay ear. .r --    I waa an executive direc-&#13;
tor of the aank aa well aa of the l'taad -      and the 1'\md built&#13;
ita new bai14iftf, I pa-opoae4 in the board that the aank and&#13;
the Pud would have a lUMuoca, the â&#128;¢ - lWMthroca, ao that&#13;
would facilitate people having lanch togetber aa4 a. .iat a&#13;
lot of each other, I waa alwaya     aOI'~   that thia p&amp;-opoaal waa&#13;
not acc::epted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Qa   Wbat waa the reaction to tbia propoeal?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          de   Iongh - 8&#13;
&#13;
de IoftfilU Well, I don 1 t know. I couldn 1 t preaa it too ach&#13;
becauae I had the impreaaion that it would be a little bit&#13;
too delicate, but it ia a proof of ay theais that the inter-&#13;
courae between the two institutions could be much better. Still,&#13;
I won't say that there are no contacta at all. On the con-&#13;
trary, I â&#128;¢m aware - and you â&#128;¢re a peaking about the research&#13;
department -- that especially the research people are quite&#13;
cloae.&#13;
&#13;
Qa But the managements of the two have been or9ani&amp;ed differently&#13;
and therefore it baa been difficult for the preaident of tbe&#13;
Bank in particular to have a oloae relationahip with the&#13;
managing director of the Puftd.&#13;
&#13;
de Iongba That's right. I think that's tbe case.&#13;
&#13;
Qâ&#128;¢ You were talking about tbe Savannah Conference aa a point&#13;
where thia becaae something of an isaue. Is there any more&#13;
you can say about tbe Savannah Conference in thia connection?&#13;
&#13;
de Iongha I -Y aay as I apeak about thia, that for the&#13;
~ric:u repreaentative, IIU"ry White, thia whole matter of&#13;
&#13;
permauat execative directors had become very important. Of&#13;
c:ouâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢   the 1'\lDd in ita present fora waa m.oatly the 14ea of&#13;
White, wbilA the clearing unioa waa the foal which Lord&#13;
Jteynea bad pJ:eferred. Keynes loat out here, an4 I thought&#13;
that a r-ark that lldrzoy Wbite aade at tbe confezoenc:e waa&#13;
very ill advised. JCeynea defended the atanclpoint that the&#13;
executive dizoeatora would only come from time to time at zoegular&#13;

doing 1111cb the aame aort. of work in the Bank that they were&#13;
doing in the Pund?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
de longha     Well, I don't think that at that        t~          that aituation&#13;
waa ao clear to all of th_, and l pel'aonally don â&#128;¢ t r...._&#13;
bezo very JaUCh about the diacuaaiona.        I do ~miMr Pund - t -&#13;

the general mana9er of the F\lftd vaa to be a         DOD~rican           that&#13;
â&#128;¢ant that the preaident of the Bank would be an. AMI'iaan.&#13;
Or rather, one    â&#128;¢r   aay it the other     way   arounch         it waa aoaâ&#128;¢&#13;
aide~      to be wiae that the preaident of the Bank voald be&#13;
an AMrican beaauae of the fact that at that ao.ent the&#13;
United Statea waa the only country frc:. vbieh the money could&#13;
ccae.     The JllOftey would have to be niaed in tl'le country&#13;
itaelf.     And it vaa natually the idea with vhieh, I think,&#13;
everybody apeed, that it would lMI        bet~      fOl'    th~   relatione&#13;
with that aoney Mrket that the head of the Intenational&#13;
Bank would be an    ~... icllan.   Ancl I tmink that J'l'&amp;cttift baa ahcwn&#13;
that 'hat waa . - ri9ht attittade to take.           h t while the&#13;
AMrieaa Govemment bacl wanted the head of the 8&amp;nlc to be&#13;
an   ~.leaa,    that didn â&#128;¢ t ...n that they had a-.oae awailaltle&#13;
right awsy.     lo, it laatsd â&#128;¢ little tiM, and then then waa&#13;
a aort. of interill â&#128;¢olution that Ill'. lllltra', a hi9hly napected&#13;
and capable banker, would become ita head.&#13;
        Hr. Meyer said right froa the bet'innin9 that be vouldD' t&#13;
atay very loDCJ, becauae he waan â&#128;¢ t ao YOWl9.             It   â&#128;¢r   be all to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   de !Oilfh .. 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the 9oed that thingâ&#128;¢ developed a little bit alowly.               There&#13;
ia nothiDg worae for an international inatitation to have&#13;
to atart working before it baa a toed ccyaniaation.                  I   r ...mber,&#13;
for inatance, ia the tJJmaA oqaniaation, which had by ita&#13;
very natue to atart WOJ:kinc) rivht away, the orpnintion aufâ&#128;¢&#13;

I think;     *Â· Meyer tried to clo aDd did.&#13;
         But, alao 1 another difficult poiat waa how to get the&#13;
people.      'lbe lntezuational Bank waa a very new inatUtationr it&#13;
waa a thiDCJ tbat had never exiated befue.             And ao 1 vbat tHy&#13;
did waa to g-et people who had had           a cez.otain experience ill life&#13;
in the financial field to acae an4 work at the Bank, a0111etiaea&#13;
even temporarily.         'lbat waâ&#128;¢ l'eally the I'Haon I c. . to the&#13;
BaDlc.     I think S aaid I waa alternate exec\ltive director both&#13;
fOI' the l'und and the Bank.         I've been a financial aan, a bankâ&#128;¢l';&#13;
all my life' I had bad experience in the Bethu'laDda Baat&#13;
inc.U.ea in exohaft9â&#128;¢ controla, and ao tbatâ&#128;¢a why they called on&#13;

      'fbey ealled on ay friend, HI'. Riat, who alao waa an&#13;
alt_...t.e execnative diHCtOJ: to be the head of the reaeal'ch&#13;

CheateJJ IIOLaia, who waa the first veaeral ct0\Ul8el, a veey&#13;
able lawyer frOID. Hew YoS'k.       And I think it waa alao MaLain&#13;
who alwaya W&amp;mle4 one ahould be very, ve17 aueful in aettint&#13;
up prec:eclents.    The Bank, being an intei'Dational os-vaniaatton,&#13;
made in that and other vaya ita own lawa, and he vaa&#13;
reaponaible for ...1D9 to it that waa an orderly p&amp;'OCedue.&#13;

&#13;
      lo a-epcu:t.a that the Bank 4idn â&#128;¢ t wor'k faat enough are to&#13;
my aiad ufounded.        If the Bank bad baaten.ed into the field,&#13;
aa acme people wanted it to do, I think it would have atarted&#13;
by being miatruated by the 11011ey IIU"ket and it would bave&#13;
ruahed to deoiaiona Which          afte~           would have proved to be&#13;
in the WOJ\9.&#13;

&#13;
to be -.ken up. I reaember when I waa still alternate executive&#13;
direetor that I was pr-ent at the . . .ti119 when sCM execu-&#13;
tive dil:'ecton wanted the treaaunr to Ht up a ayatem by&#13;
which the ten billion dollars, which they tboutht they had,&#13;
would be distributed over the Mmbera. 'l'hey thought there vaa&#13;
such a tremencloua need for .110ney that there would be a rush Oil&#13;
the bank â&#128;¢ a aaaets and that it would beÂ· nee. .aary to â&#128;¢lee cer-&#13;
tain quotas for everybody aacot:dinq to their needa. 'l'his would&#13;
have been totally unrealistic beeauae thia ia not a give-&#13;
away operation, the Bank baa to finanee certain needa of the&#13;
eounu-1.. and the countries have to show what they al!'e worth&#13;
but they .also have to abow f.- what the aoney ia uceaaary.&#13;
      I donâ&#128;¢t   remember now which applioat1ona came in but&#13;
what we alwaya joked about waa that when an application              OllM&#13;
&#13;
in in the be9irmin9 of the davelopaent staqe, it was moatly loÂ»&#13;
soo million dollarâ&#128;¢. Tbe next thinv then , . . to aalu well,&#13;
what clo you want the 500 million dollars fOl', becauae i f the&#13;
BaDk ia to - â&#128;¢ a loan it wants to be sure that ita IIOftey 1a&#13;

11108tly, one didn â&#128;¢ t get IIUCh in.for.ation al:toat tbat.&#13;
    I think I ahould firat att:eaa that the          ~     of the Bank&#13;

401\e befOJ:"e. And ao, when the firat loan -            about -- that was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  . . lonth- 14&#13;

Q: I wonder if I could aak a quick queatioa about thia quota&#13;
concept. Did all the exeeutive directorâ&#128;¢ auppe.t the idea fo~&#13;
                                                                 '&#13;
a while that the         ~un48   of the Baak   ahou~d be.   allocated in acme&#13;
sort of a geographic quota ayatem?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
de Iongha Well .. 1 think the idea really a._ moatly f r - loath&#13;
American cOUDtriâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ and tbia vaa quite ~atandable beaauae&#13;
the South American countriea badn â&#128;¢ t bad direct loaHa flraa the&#13;
war and they were afraid -- and one can have a f . .lin9 for thd -&#13;
that the amountâ&#128;¢ that would have to go into BU%opean recon-&#13;
struction loans would be ao bit tbat not enaugh 110ney would&#13;
remain for the underdeveloped cOtmtriea. And they alao rea-&#13;
lised that aaeb requeata would ca.. a little later, and                  t~&#13;
&#13;
when tM requeata c - the aoney aitht be gone. But tbe reaaon&#13;
l quoted thia diacuaaion waa eapeeially to show that nobody&#13;
haC! much idea oa how the money would be coming aDd how necea-&#13;
HI'J' it waa to ueate an ataoaphen of tnat. and to create&#13;
a Ml'ket.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Qa De ,._ recall how the American executive direetu felt about&#13;
the quota     pro~al?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
de IoDCJhs Well., if I remember well -            of cwr... it 419â&#128;¢ into&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
his 8Q9pation about the limitation on the ability of the Bank&#13;
to borrow, if any, had really considered that the Baak had&#13;
considerably leaa that 10 billion dollara available to leftcl.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
de Iongha     Yea.   J think, thwvb, that the diaauaaiona about&#13;

        . . .idea, it would be the Bank's policy that it abcNld&#13;
prepan. a . .rut for tbe borrowi119 countries, and while             ~i9bt&#13;

also later, money marketa in Bnglan4, in Bolland and in&#13;

&#13;

de Ionvba     It would be cheaper and it would be_ also an&#13;

&amp;#12;a.   Juat . . . . . tter of curioaity, as far as personalities&#13;
are concerned, do you suppose the fact that Mr. tiat was&#13;
himaelf a Frenchman had any influence in his own particular&#13;
arguments in that case?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ds 101'19h*    Well, it may be that the :.c,giaa:i. l'rench mind of&#13;
Jb:. lliat made bill briD9 foa:th the arvUMnta which, of coua:ae,&#13;
had theia: value.     On the otbe&amp;- hand, I coraaider it acluded&#13;
that  *Â· Jtiat WCNld have used these a&amp;-CJUMnta in favor of the&#13;
French because be ia a rrencbaan. I think one of the ,reateat&#13;
acbiev-nta of the Bank baa been that nationality aa such&#13;
played no role at all.       Of courH everybody bz'ouvht with hila&#13;
the special vi&amp;"tuea and faults of hia own nationality, but&#13;
that is a different thing.          I haven't seen in any aift9lâ&#128;¢&#13;
instance any staff ..-be&amp;- who used this as an influence&#13;
against his better     jlld~Jant,   ataiDat the purpoaea of the Bank&#13;
jut because he was of the debtoa:a nationality.          It baa often&#13;
been just the coatruy, because aa a _,... of a certain nation&#13;
underatanda hie country well, be could far more easily detect&#13;
the Ilia takes they JB&amp;I.     I have fro. tiM to tiM heard the&#13;
a~t           that â&#128;¢ - countryâ&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ ccaplain that when a -.ber of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Qa   ltill, I auppoae, the point in the c:aH of the l'rench loan&#13;
was that tbe l'rench Government officialâ&#128;¢ involved felt that&#13;

waa more inclined pceaibly than otherwiae to aupport thie&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
      I personally thought that thia miqht be a very qood&#13;
occaaion in teating out the -.y the Polea run their eaoncay,&#13;
the amount waa too amall to do any harm and it miqht do a&#13;
lot of good to Burope by increaaift9 the amount c:tf coal to be&#13;
put at ita diapoaal.        An., I donâ&#128;¢t think that Mr. McCloy aa,.,&#13;
thia differently, but the American government evidently waa&#13;
againat the whole transaction, and eo nothinq eame of it.&#13;
I still think it might' have been an experiment that would&#13;
have given   U8;   â&#128;¢â&#128;¢pecially thrOUCJh end-ue aupeniaion, eontaets&#13;
with the Polâ&#128;¢â&#128;¢ and a bettel:' uderstandinv. !'he Poles then&#13;
were offended and they left the International Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Qa   Do you know in what way the American CJovernment â&#128;¢nifeaaed&#13;
ita diaaqreement with the idea of making the loan to the Polea?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
de lonqha    Well, I think they followed the nocmal aouree of&#13;
telliD9 their exeeutive 4U.CtoÂ¥ to voce apintat             it~   and that,&#13;
of courae ~ was the ead of 1 t.      One couldl'l â&#128;¢ t anc! even didn â&#128;¢ t&#13;
want to artue with it.        Row, I'm only aayi119 thia beeauae that&#13;
waa my iapa:ession.     l may be wroncJ then, althO\lfb I don't â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Qa   Do yo.a know of any other oocasicms in the early days of&#13;
the laDk when a MJiber&#13;
apiaat a partinlar loan?&#13;

de IODCJhâ&#128;¢   Well, it baa bec01118 padltally a habit in the Bank&#13;
that the way   â&#128;¢mbe~:   governmentâ&#128;¢ brlntr tbeae thinp to the&#13;
notice of the board and of the management is not tb%ouqb fightâ&#128;¢&#13;
ing in board . . . tin9s.    'lheae thingâ&#128;¢ an nther dealt with by&#13;
&amp;#12;4iacuaiona, and I think that the aeentary of the Bank playa&#13;
a very uaeful role in diaauaaing thinva with the executive directora 1&#13;
who have a great truat in him, tellint hila when acaething ia&#13;
brewing and enabling him to briJl9 it to the attention of the&#13;
pr4tai.dent.    And that I think haa workecl ao well in the bank&#13;
aeetiDga that there have nevezo been any difficultiu, and if&#13;
an exeautive director, or rather bia country~ doeanâ&#128;¢t like a&#13;
certain loan becauae they have no politieal ayapatby for the&#13;
bol:rower, then the director, in the aaea I bave a..n, had to&#13;
qne that the International Bank ia an iDtenatioaal â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢titu-&#13;
tion, that it baa to look at a loan frca tbe aide of ita&#13;
econoaiea, and then be â&#128;¢Y jut uaent hiuelf froa the boa#d&#13;
. . .tin9a or when p:eaent uatain frt.ft votin9.     In fact, tl,e&#13;
votillf in the Bank alwaya goea in a      ~y   irtfonaal way, ao that&#13;
it'a not even neceaaary to aay     â&#128;¢x   vote againat it", but one&#13;
may aak to have it noted in the lli.Dutea if ou abataina.&#13;

     However, then came a furioua cable froa Brazil aayiag&#13;
that. they had heard that Spaniah would be an official laJ1911Ate,&#13;

it waa decided that that votald be too mach and ao aa not to&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In August 1961, Daniel Crena de Longh
            was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives
            oral history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure
            at the Bank from 1946 to 1955, Mr. de Longh worked in the
            following areas: as alternate executive director
            representing the Netherlands and the Union of South Africa
            (1946); as treasure of the World Bank (1946-1952); and as
            executive director representing the Netherlands, Israel, and
            Yugoslavia (1953-1955). His transcript addresses his
            contribution in discussion of the financial difficulties of
            the American treasury (1943), the savannah conference
            (1946), and the importance of end-use supervision
            elaborating on the first loan of the World Bank to France.
            He discusses in detail the World Bank finances, such as
            portfolio sales, bonds, guarantees, and the opening up of
            several new money markets outside the United States. He
            discusses the policy of recruiting domestic and
            international World Bank staff, the advantage of the trainee
            system, and also discusses salary structure and promotion at
            the World Bank.
