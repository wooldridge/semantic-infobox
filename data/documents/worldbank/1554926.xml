ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper first examines the changing size distribution of industry&#13;
in developing countries by region and over time, and, by reference to firm-&#13;
level surveys, it discusses the underlying causes. The importance of markets&#13;
generated by the growth of agriculture and rural incomes for the regional&#13;
development of industry, both small and large scale, is noted. Second, it&#13;
discusses the entrepreneurship issue, arguing that while small and large firms&#13;
alike are highly responsive to the growth of markets, the measured entre-&#13;
preneurial response is neither as full nor as efficient as is desirable. The&#13;
third and last part discusses small industry programs and their relation to&#13;
development policy. Financing and extension programs are considered in&#13;
detail, and there is a discussion of the risks involved. Some parallels with&#13;
agricultural credit are discussed, in particular the default problem and the&#13;
problems associated with concessionary finance. It is also argued that small&#13;
industries--and, by implication, the programs intended to support them--would&#13;
stand to benefit from more efficient (and also more labor demanding) policies&#13;
towards agriculture and industry.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
The role of small industries in the development process has been the&#13;
subject of a large number of studies over the past 30 years. The reasons for&#13;
the interest are familiar, and can be stated briefly. Although large industry&#13;
has absorbed huge shares of total investment, it still accounts for small&#13;
shares of industrial employment in all but a few countries now in advanced&#13;
stages of industrialization. It is also concentrated in metropolitan areas.&#13;
In contrast, household (or "cottage") industries and small workshops and&#13;
factories account for appreciably larger shares of recorded industrial&#13;
employment, are more labor intensive in aggregate, and more widely dispersed&#13;
in provincial towns and cities. Case histories of medium and larger sized&#13;
firms have also suggested that much of the growth of employment in large&#13;
industry is due to the expansion of previously small firms through the size&#13;
distribution. For these and other reasons it is argued that a shift of&#13;
investment towards small industry would both improve earnings opportunities&#13;
for a larger share of the labor force and encourage regional industrial&#13;
development.l/ In a large measure, these arguments have been accepted, and in&#13;
most developing countries, governments have introduced special programs of&#13;
support--for example in the form of small industry finance, extension and&#13;
advisory services, infrastructure,and programs for the training of managers&#13;
and workers.&#13;
It is surprising, given the apparent commitment towards developing&#13;
small industries, that little is known about how the various programs adopted&#13;
have worked out in practice. In general terms it can be said that they have&#13;
often proved to be administratively costly and to have exposed the financial&#13;
intermediaries involved to significant risks. But beyond this, the&#13;
information available is not concrete and, in addition, both the designs of&#13;
the programs and what has been achieved vary greatly.&#13;
Furthermore, it is clear that the prevailing economic policies of&#13;
many developing countries stand in direct contradiction to interventions to&#13;
assist small industries, and necessarily limit what such interventions can be&#13;
1/ For recent reviews see World Bank (1978a, 1978b). Of the many earlier&#13;
studies on the subject the following have become standard: Hoselitz (1959),&#13;
Staley and Morse (1966), Dhar and Lydall (1960), Berna (1960), and Shinohara&#13;
(1968) on Japan. See also Kilby (1962) on Nigeria, Aubrey (1951) and United&#13;
Nations (1969). China's experience with small rural industries has also&#13;
attracted a lot of attention; see e.g., Sigurdson (1978), Perkins and others&#13;
(1979) and Riskin (1978). Further references will be cited below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

expected ta achieve. 1/ In the first place, the tariffs and investment&#13;
incentives in many countries were expressly intended to foster the development&#13;
of large-scale industry, often on a capital intensive basis, and continue to&#13;
do so. Administrative controls on interest rates and the borrowings and&#13;
lendings of the organized financial sector have worked in the same direction&#13;
by making it profitable for the intermediaries to lend only to large (often&#13;
foreign-owned) concerns and to a small minority of influential small borrowers&#13;
of good standing. Even where finance has been made available for small&#13;
industry, it has again found its way, as in agriculture, mainly to influential&#13;
borrowers of good standing, attracted by the concessionary rates associated&#13;
with the programs. Policies towards agriculture, apart from suffering&#13;
themselves from the huge shift of investment towards large industry, have&#13;
similarly had adverse effects. By restricting the growth of rural incomes&#13;
over large regions, they must also have restricted the growth of the markets&#13;
for the products of mostly small-scale, local industry.&#13;
It is tempting to argue, therefore, that unless the general structure&#13;
of economic policies is more appropriate in some first-best sense, there is&#13;
little that can be accomplished in the way of direct interventions to solve&#13;
particular problems--such as interventions to improve the supply of skilled&#13;
labor, infrastructural services and finance to small industry. This would,&#13;
however, be too extreme a view of the options open. As Landes (1969)&#13;
remarked, no economic and social system has ever been pushed to its logical&#13;
limits, and the weight of the evidence is that it is possible for incomes to&#13;
rise in spite of contradictions in structure. 2/ It is only when the&#13;
contradictions are overwhelming that we might expect, in the present case,&#13;
small industry programs to be serving no useful purpose0 But the point&#13;
remains that it is not possible to assess the effectiveness of small industry&#13;
programs without first assessing how small industries are affected by the&#13;
general structure of development policy0&#13;
The above considerations lead us to raise three groups of questions:&#13;
(1) What is the ex post evidence on the effectiveness of&#13;
small industry' programs? What lessons have emerged?&#13;
1/ On the incidence of development policies on small and large-scale&#13;
activities, it is difficult to think of better reviews than the essays of&#13;
Myint (1971, Chapter 14) on dualism, and Shaw (1973, Chapter 1) on financial&#13;
repression0 See also McKinnon (1973) and Leff (1976)o These studies do not&#13;
discuss the effects of the agricultural strategy on industrial development,&#13;
for which reference should be made to Johnston and Kilby (1975), Mellor&#13;
(1976), and perhaps also Leiserson's and my study (1980).&#13;

(2) How are small industries--and, by implication, the programs&#13;
intended to assist them--affected by the general structure of&#13;
policies towards agriculture and industry?&#13;
(3) How far would the programs be needed if these policies were&#13;
better chosen? Would it still be necessary to intervene in the&#13;
capital markets, for example, if interest rates were allowed to&#13;
rise to cost- and risk-reflecting levels? Would the risks&#13;
involved extinguish the institutions interest in the markets,&#13;
as recent research on uncertainty in economics would suggest?&#13;
In brief, why intervene?&#13;
These questions are taken up in Part III. But before this, it is&#13;
necessary to consider two other issues.&#13;
The first of these is considered in Part I, and concerns our still-&#13;
limited understanding of the role of small industries in the industrialization&#13;
process. It is over 15 years since Staley and Morse reviewed the available&#13;
information on small industries in developing countries, and made some cross-&#13;
country comparisons. Several household- and firm-level surveys have appeared&#13;
since then, and there have been a number of studies (cited below) drawing on&#13;
more recent census and survey data. Part I attempts to review this material,&#13;
and to assess what is known about the changing size structure of industry by&#13;
region and over time. Its aim is purely descriptive.&#13;
The second issue concerns the efficiency of entrepreneurship in&#13;
developing countries, and is discussed in Part II. A common theme of the&#13;
studies reviewed in Part I is that both small and large firms are highly&#13;
responsive to the opportunities provided by market growth. With respect to&#13;
small firms, this is especially--though not exclusively--observable in those&#13;
agricultural regions in which rural incomes are rising, since the dispersion&#13;
of the product and labor markets and the costs of transport also favor a&#13;
correspondingly dispersed pattern of production in small-scale activities over&#13;
a long period. As noted, there is also evidence of some firms expanding&#13;
through the size distribution. Such changes are apparently taking place&#13;
notwithstanding the often exceedingly poor backgrounds of the proprietors, and&#13;
their disadvantages with respect to industrial incentives policies noted&#13;
above. In these respects, the tacit assumption of many studies on industrial&#13;
development, that entrepreneurship is in highly elastic supply, is&#13;
supported. But the additional assumption that entrepreneurship can be ignored&#13;
in the design of industrial development policies is not supported. In the&#13;
first place, firm-level studies have pointed to appreciable technical or&#13;
managerial inefficiencies in small industries, concluding that programs to&#13;
address these (as with those in agriculture) can be as important as price&#13;
incentives in raising output. Secondly, practically all available studies of&#13;
the measured entrepreneurial response are based on biased sampling&#13;
procedures: they have considered only those members of the labor force who&#13;
have established successful firms. Examination of the circumstances of those&#13;
who are not part of this response, or even of those whose firms failed, leads&#13;
to less complacent assumptions about entrepreneurship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
As noted, Part III considers programs of support for small&#13;
industry. These programs are generally made up of several quite different&#13;
elements, each of which could be subjects of book-length treatments. Hence it&#13;
is necessary to be selective. In this paper, only finance and the supporting&#13;
extension services are considered. In terms of resources committed, these are&#13;
the main elements in most small industry programs--though training and infra-&#13;
structure should arguably receive equal or greater weight.&#13;
It will be seen that the financing of small industry is bedeviled by&#13;
the same problems, though to a lesser degree, as those that afflict the&#13;
finance of small-holder agriculture, as one might gather from remarks made&#13;
earlier0 Although experiences vary, these are high default rates and, as&#13;
noted above, concessionary finance attracting well-to-do borrowers who do not&#13;
need the support of the programs0 Administrative controls on financial inter-&#13;
mediation also extinguish any interest on the part of the private intermedi-&#13;
aries in entering the market0&#13;
Many economists have argued that these problems would be greatly&#13;
reduced if the institutions were allowed to charge cost- and risk-reflecting&#13;
interest rates0 It is sometimes argued, further, that this would be suf-&#13;
ficient to attract the private intermediaries into lending to small industries&#13;
and, if that is the case, there would be little need for public interventions&#13;
in the capital markets 0 It will be argued that a relaxation of controls--and&#13;
on interst rates in particular--would indeed be a step forward, but in itself&#13;
not sufficient to achieve an efficient allocation of financial resources&#13;
between large and small industry0 There are several reasons for this and&#13;
which are elaborated on in Part III: evidence of risk-avoidance by the staff&#13;
of the financial institutions, beyond the point determined by economic&#13;
efficiency; the external costs that high interest rates impose on potentially&#13;
low-risk borrowers; and political reactions to sizeable differentials in&#13;
interest rates between large and small borrowers0 These factors loom large in&#13;
developing countries at the present time, given that the financial insti-&#13;
tutions are highly adapted to meeting the demands of a small number of large&#13;
and influential borrowers, and ill-adapted to meeting those of a large number&#13;
of small borrowers0 It is difficult to see a major shift of policy occurring,&#13;
except over an exceedingly long period of time, without inducements such as&#13;
risk-sharing programs between the public and private sectors, and without the&#13;
mandatory involvement of the public banks in the task0 This conclusion is, I&#13;
believe, obvious to administrators and to those involved in industrial&#13;
finance, though less obvious to many economists who write on the subject, so&#13;
this section is addressed to them0&#13;
A somewhat separate issue connected with small industry programs&#13;
arises from differing perceptions of the employment problem in developing&#13;
countries. The programs are seen by many of those involved in policy-making&#13;
as a means of reducing unemployment0 Very often, further controls are placed&#13;
on the (concessionary) finance made available by the programs, such as that it&#13;
may only be used for "job-creating" projects, for fixed asset finance in firms&#13;
expanding the number employed, and so on0 By reference to recent surveys on&#13;
employment in developing countries, it will be argued that such controls&#13;
unnecessarily limit the capacity of the programs to improve earnings&#13;
opportunities0 This discussion forms the middle section of Part III; the last&#13;
section deals with the complementarities between movements to what most&#13;
economists would agree are more efficient (and also more labor demanding)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
policies in general, and specific interventions to assist small industry.&#13;
In order to define the issues for study, it has been necessary in&#13;
this introduction to anticipate several conclusions reached below. The&#13;
conclusions that are presented in Part IV are, therefore, limited to a&#13;
recapitulation of the main points made and noting some outstanding issues.&#13;
&#13;

I.   CHANGES IN THE SIZE STRUCTURE OF INDUSTRY BY REGION AND OVER TIME&#13;
In the course of industrial growth, the composition of manufacturing&#13;
activities, when classified according to scale, appears to pass through three&#13;
phases:&#13;
(1) A phase in which household manufacturing is predominant, accounting for&#13;
one-half to three-quarters or more of total manufacturing employment;&#13;
(2) A phase in which small workshops and factories emerge at a comparatively&#13;
rapid rate, and act to displace household manufacturing in several&#13;
sectors; and&#13;
(3) A phase in which large-scale production becomes predominant, displacing&#13;
the remaining household manufacturing activities and a large share--&#13;
though not the whole--of workshop and small factory production. This&#13;
phase is partly a product of the second, since the recorded growth of&#13;
output and employment in large-scale manufacturing can be divided into:&#13;
(a) the growth of once small firms through the size structure, and (b)&#13;
the expansion of already large domestic and foreign concerns.&#13;
This section presents some statistical material on these trends, and discusses&#13;
the underlying causes.&#13;
It is apparent that none of the phases are distinct, and in fact&#13;
there is considerable overlap between the three. Furthermore, the changes&#13;
differ greatly between sectors, and even between regions within the same&#13;
country, as it is hoped the following analysis makes clear. However, the&#13;
classification is useful for making some distinctions that are necessary for&#13;
thinking about policy. Programs that may be apropriate for one phase because&#13;
there is a sufficient demand for the services offered (e.g., for fixed-term&#13;
finance, industrial estates and subcontracting exchanges during phase 2 and&#13;
afterwards) may be less appropriate earlier because there is not. This is an&#13;
obvious point, perhaps, but one that is often missed in the design of the&#13;
programs. The plan below is to examine the trends in aggregate first and then&#13;
highlight some differences between industries and regions.&#13;
The above phases are familiar from the historical studies of the now&#13;
industrialized countries. 1/ Hoselitz used this material in his remarkably&#13;
prescient article in 1959, to which Livingstone (1980) rightly continues to&#13;
draw our attention. But it is now possible to say something additional by&#13;
drawing on the various censuses and studies that appeared in the 1960s and 70s&#13;
for the developing countries.&#13;
1/ See e.g., Parker (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Aggregate Data: Sources and Limitations&#13;
Table 1 provides some recent evidence on employment in manufacturing&#13;
at a single point in time for fifteen countries. Following other writers, the&#13;
types and scales of activity have been divided into three groups: large&#13;
establishments, employing 100 workers or more; small establishments, employing&#13;
less than 100 workers; and household manufacturing. 1/ The last item is&#13;
estimated in the usual way as a residual, which is the difference between&#13;
manufacturing employment recorded in the labor force surveys (which cover all&#13;
types and scales of activity) and the establishment surveys (which only cover&#13;
workshops and factories above a certain size). For brevity, these groups are&#13;
referred to as large factories (or large firms, where a firm has 100 or more&#13;
workers), small factories (or firms), and household manufacturing&#13;
respectively.&#13;
The' precise choice of the dividing line between these groups is&#13;
unavoidably arbitrary. It is important, of course, that the conclusions to be&#13;
drawn from the analysis would not change with another (equally arbitrary)&#13;
choice, which I believe is the case below. Staley and Morse (1966, Chapter 1)&#13;
proposed a much more detailed classification in which household manufacturing&#13;
would be divided into five groups and factory production into three (small,&#13;
medium and large). The former would include, for example, subsistence&#13;
manufacturing, artisans working in the home, artisans with workshops, and&#13;
industrial home-work paid for in wages or by piece under the "putting out"&#13;
system. But apart from the difficulties of obtaining evidence in this detail,&#13;
some useful insights are provided by the more aggregate figures shown.&#13;
The countries have been ranked in order of their "levels of&#13;
industrialization" as measured by the percentage of GDP from outside&#13;
agriculture. Where this measure is close for two or more countries, within&#13;
the bounds of measurement error, they have been ranked in order of their per&#13;
capita incomes. Exceptions are India and Indonesia, since oil revenues give&#13;
the latter an unusually high ranking in terms of both measures; on other&#13;
measures India is considered to be more industrialized. 2/&#13;
To complement this cross-section evidence, Table 2 shows recent&#13;
trends in the size structure of manufacturing in six developing countries.&#13;
Following the example of Hoselitz (1959), some historical data for two&#13;
1/ Sometimes called "cottage industries." Both terms in some respects are&#13;
misnomers, since they include activities undertaken away from the dwellings&#13;
(e.g., carpentry, smithing). Alternative terms such as "informal" sector&#13;
industries are no more illuminating, however.&#13;
2/ Hughes (1980, Chapter 1) uses the share of manufacturing in commodity&#13;
production as a measure of industrialization. Her ranking is close to that&#13;
given above.&#13;

e/   The Indian Census data define household manufacturing in a way that&#13;
makes comparisons with other countries difficult. Establishments&#13;
employing up to 20 workers without power, or up to 10 workers with power,&#13;
using "mainly" household labor may be classified as "household"&#13;
manufacturers; the above table has put all units with over 10 workers,&#13;
whether household or non-household, in the establishment columns. The&#13;
establishment data shown are based on the average of two estimates&#13;
provided by Mazumdar.&#13;

The limitations and inconsistencies in the employment data are&#13;
familiar, and need little additional comment. 1/ Under-enumeration of&#13;
household employment is common in all countries, but particularly in Africa,&#13;
where it is reportedly as high as 40% in some countries.2/ The reference&#13;
periods for the surveys vary greatly, as do sampling procedures. In rural&#13;
areas, the larger share of manufacturing employment is an off-farm, part-time&#13;
activity that peaks in the slack season; hence measurements of its extent are&#13;
highly sensitive both to the timing of the surveys and to how employment is&#13;
defined. It is impossible to reconcile the series precisely, but it is&#13;
believed that the inconsistencies are not such as to obscure the changes&#13;
taking place.&#13;
To facilitate interpretations of the data, figure 2 summarizes the&#13;
changes in the size structure of industry over time schematically and&#13;
indicates roughly where each country is currently placed. The ordinates&#13;
represent the share of each scale of activity in total manufacturing&#13;
employment, and the horizontal axes represent time. The heights and slopes of&#13;
the curves differ between each country for a number of reasons, including&#13;
differences in the industrialization policies followed and the pace of&#13;
industrialization. It is the occurrences of certain points of inflexion and,&#13;
with respect to employment in small firms, an eventual peaking and then a&#13;
decline in the employment shares that countries have so far had in common as&#13;
industrialization proceeded, and it is this that gives the curves similar&#13;
shapes across countries.&#13;
The correspondence between the curves shown in Figure 2 and those&#13;
based on the historical data in Figure 1 for Japan is clear. A similar&#13;
pattern can be seen in the cross-section data in Table 1, except perhaps for&#13;
the African countries, in which under-enumeration of household employment may&#13;
also have led to too high an estimate of the shares of employment in both&#13;
small and large factories. Of the four countries identified as being in one&#13;
part or another of the second phase (India, Philippines, Colombia and Turkey)&#13;
each but Colombia shows a high rate of growth of employment in small factories&#13;
(Table 2). Taiwan and Korea are now leaving the second phase, with the shares&#13;
of employment in small factories seemingly having peaked at a much lower level&#13;
than occurred in Japan (Table 2).&#13;
What factors explain these trends and changes? Consider each phase&#13;
in turn.&#13;
1/ Value added data are even more unreliable than employment data, and for&#13;
household manufacturing are rarely available. For this reason there was no&#13;
option but to concentrate on employment for studying changes in the size&#13;

The Predominance of Household Manufacturing Over Long Periods.&#13;
There is little that is not familiar to be said about the&#13;
predominance and then the gradual decline, over long periods, of household&#13;
manufacturing. 1/. With the exception of developing countries in advanced&#13;
stages of the industrialization process, the majority of people recorded as&#13;
being in this form of employment are in low income, agricultural&#13;
regions. 2/ It comprises village industries - smiths, shoemakers, garment-&#13;
makers, handicrafts, masons, carpenters, builders, various crop processing&#13;
activities and so on - and the subsistence-level, off-farm activities of&#13;
peasant households. 3/. For the most part, their function is to provide&#13;
rudimentary inputs and processing services to agriculture and to cater for the&#13;
non-food needs of the rural population. They seem to differ little from the&#13;
cottage industries that "persisted in one corner of Europe or another up&#13;
through the nineteenth century" and which changed slowly or were displaced&#13;
gradually under the influence of a steady growth of markets. 4/.&#13;
In the earlier studies of small industries, household manufacturing&#13;
was commonly dismissed as a tradition bound, low income and economically&#13;
backward activity, offering few possibilities for raising incomes. For this&#13;
reason it was sometimes proposed that small industry programs should&#13;
concentrate on "modern" small industry only, i.e. on workshops and factories&#13;
above a certain size, say 10 to 20 workers. But later studies questioned this&#13;
view, and noted in addition that household manufacturing is too important a&#13;
source of income and employment, over a long period, to be neglected in the&#13;
design of development policy. Norcliffe and Freeman (1980, p. 508-9), drawing&#13;
on field survey data in Kenya, remark that "only a small range of 'tradional'&#13;
activities is practiced by the rural non-farm sector. In reality a very wide&#13;
range of activities is present, including not only most of [those types&#13;
of] activities carried on by the urban informal sector, but also a variety of&#13;
resource based and agro-processing activities. Traditional craft industries&#13;
are also practiced, but the majority should not be regarded as traditional.&#13;
1/ See especially Staley and Morse, op. cit., Chapters 2 to 4, for some lucid&#13;
descriptions of these activities in developing countries.&#13;
2/ In India, roughly three quarters of household manufacturing employment is&#13;
rural, in East and West Africa probably well over three quarters, in Colombia&#13;
and the Philippines over half, and in Korea roughly two-fifths. See the&#13;
references noted in Tables 1 and 2 plus Anderson and Leiserson (1980)&#13;
3/ For a detailed breakdown of rural manufacturing employment in three&#13;
African countries, see Chuta and Leidholm (1976) on Sierra Leone; Mueller and&#13;
Zevering (1970) on Nigeria; Norcliffee and Freeman (1980), Kuruneri (1977),&#13;
and Williams and McClintock (1981), all on Kenya. See Shetty (1963) on India.&#13;
4/ Parker, op. cit. pp. 43-45.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Further, it is now apparent that many of the activities are capable of&#13;
elementary modernization with the introduction of diesel engines and the&#13;
electrification of rural areas 1/, e.g. through motive power for crop&#13;
processing on a small scale, and for the manufacture of garments, farm&#13;
implements, building materials, furniture and so on.&#13;
In fact, the rates of transition from household to factory-based&#13;
manufacturing differ greatly between sectors, and in some activities household&#13;
employment may be rising in both relative and absolute terms when&#13;
industrialization is proceding rapidly. To illustrate this point, Table 3&#13;
presents data for three manufacturing sectors in the Philippines. Each sector&#13;
either once was or now is a significant source of employment in households.&#13;
In food processing, household activities declined rapidly in the 1960's and&#13;
1970's as a consequence of mechanization in the processing of the country's&#13;
two principal crops, rice and corn. Household or "backyard" employment in the&#13;
light engineering industries, on the other hand, increased enormously in&#13;
response to demand, as can be seen from the middle rows of the table, and&#13;
accounted for much of the growth of the urban informal sector - and also for&#13;
much of the recorded growth of manufacturing employment overall. In clothing&#13;
and footwear, employment in household activities was sustained at a high&#13;
level, we believe, by the "putting-out" of work in the garments and embroidery&#13;
industries, activities undertaken mostly by women as a secondary source of&#13;
family income. However "strong" the aggregate trends might be, therefore,&#13;
significant differences can be observed between particular sectors.&#13;
Differences are also apparent between activities in the so-called&#13;
urban informal sector, in which household manufacturing may be growing while&#13;
its rural counterpart is declining. Again, it is necessary to disaggregate to&#13;
understand the changes taking place, since the diversity of manufacturing&#13;
activities within urban areas precludes easy generalization, and it is&#13;
necessary to accept several elements in any explanation of its origins and&#13;
growth. 2/ Some activities are secondary source of income, undertaken by&#13;
1/ See the World Bank (1975) paper on rural electrification, which discusses&#13;
the growth of demand from household and commercial users in village&#13;
communities; many of the latter are small enterprises. Myint (1971) remarks&#13;
that "the growth of small industries (in Japan) was greatly facilitated by&#13;
access to cheap electric power - a reduction in dualism in the supply of&#13;
public economic services."&#13;
2/ See e.g. Mazumdar (1976) on the urban informal sector. Also Anderson and&#13;

women and maintained under the "putting out" system. 1/ Other are low-&#13;
income, near-subsistence activities undertaken to provide for the households&#13;
of the urban, informal sector itself. A minority hire labor and provide a&#13;
point of entry for migrant workers to the urban labor market. For others, it&#13;
is a high-income activity, serving high growth urban markets and providing&#13;
earnings levels exceeding those obtained by skilled labor in the formal&#13;
sector. 2/ Finally, for those intending to establish small or larger firms,&#13;
"backyard" manufacturing is a natural starting point, if only to minimize&#13;
overheads and reduce risks while the product and its market are being&#13;
developed.&#13;
Practically all the points so far made are neatly encapsulated in&#13;
Kenneth King's study of Kenya's informal machine makers. It might be useful&#13;
to quote some findings 3/&#13;
"It is not ... sufficient to describe it [the informal&#13;
sector] as merely a flock of artisans making poor-&#13;
quality goods for Kenya's majority of poor people ...&#13;
the informal sector has not been involved with the&#13;
same limited line of goods from the start ... a number&#13;
of artisans have begun to edge their way into devising&#13;
machines of their own, to facilitate certain&#13;
processes, and to enable them to make new products ...&#13;
The main reason for hesitating about any imminent fall&#13;
in the range of wages and income available in the&#13;
informal sector is the spread of these entrepreneurs&#13;
geographically into even the smallest towns of Kenya,&#13;
and the concurrent spread of the range of items&#13;
produced ... Even if we acknowledge the critical&#13;
connections between the sorts of goods and services&#13;
produced in these spreading frontiers of the informal&#13;
sector and the changing structure of the larger scale&#13;
local and foreign enterprise in Kenya, its operation&#13;
does at least promise to bring to the vast majority of&#13;
poorer homes in Kenya a wider range of very cheap&#13;
household items than they have possessed in the past&#13;
... the operations of [the] informal machine makers&#13;
... [have] the hallmark of improvisation that is so&#13;
conspicuously absent from so much foregin production&#13;
in Kenya."&#13;
1/ The "putting out" of work was also prevalent at one time in Europe and&#13;
Japan, though most writers emphasize its importance in rural areas. Shinohara&#13;
(1966) and Landes (1969 p. 190).&#13;

More recent studies, therefore, have drawn attention to heterogeneity&#13;
of household or cottage industries, and pointed to the role of some of these&#13;
activities in providing earnings opportunities over a long period of the&#13;
development process. Labels such as "tradition-bound" or even "low income and&#13;
declining" were sometimes apt - but more frequently too sweeping and&#13;
misleading. This conclusion is perhaps platitudinous, but was often missed in&#13;
earlier studies.&#13;
The Emergence of Small Factories and Firms&#13;
Inspecting the historical data for the industrialized countries,&#13;
Hoselitz noted: 1/ "Of greater interest than the ... decline of dwarf&#13;
[household] industries is the divergent development of small industry&#13;
employing six to forty-nine persons, in Germany and Japan. In Germany the&#13;
proportion of the labor force in small industry increased from 18.6 per cent&#13;
in 1882 to 25 per cent in 1907, and thereafter began to decline ... Japanese&#13;
industry [as can be seen in Figure 1 above] shows the rather unusual feature&#13;
of smaller plants growing faster than larger ones in a period of rising&#13;
prosperity".&#13;
However, it now seems that this feature is not unusual for developing&#13;
countries, as noted above in connection with Tables 1 and 2 (see especially&#13;
Biswajit Banerjee's data for Uttar Pradesh, and the figures for the&#13;
Philippines). Staley and Morse have made the same point. 2/ Similarly&#13;
Ranadev Banerji's (1978) study of manufacturing industries at the two-digit&#13;
level reveal high percentages of employment in small factories in developing&#13;
countries. Banerji's estimates are summarized in Table 4:3/&#13;

First note the still high share (52%) of employment provided by small&#13;
factories in developing countries, which squares with the estimates given&#13;
above in Tables 1 and 2. Second, note its high concentration (70%) in "light"&#13;
industries relative to that found in the high income countries. The gradual&#13;
shift towards heavy industry as industrialization proceeds is also reflected&#13;
in the growth elasticities for the products of heavy industry. 4/&#13;
What explains the comparatively rapid emergence of small firms - over&#13;
quite a long period - before their share in total industrial activity begins&#13;
to decline in favor of large firms? The trend is somewhat surprising in the&#13;
light of the overwhelming preference for large industry in the&#13;
industrialization policies prevailing in most developing countries. Three&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
reasons have been put forward 1/, none of which, so far as I am aware, have&#13;
been subject to quantitative analysis.&#13;
First recall that the process occurs when the majority of the labor&#13;
force are still in the rural areas and towns. Hence in conditions where&#13;
agricultural output and rural incomes are rising, the newly created markets&#13;
for consumer and capital goods (the latter as an input to agriculture) are&#13;
highly dispersed. Infrastructure and transport services in these areas are&#13;
also poor, and the difficulties of reaching the markets necessitates a&#13;
fragmented pattern of production in small scale units.2/ Further growth in&#13;
rural incomes and improvements in infrastructure broadens the markets and&#13;
permit an increasing degree of entry by large scale. But for many categories&#13;
of consumer and capital goods industries, the transport and marketing costs&#13;
between town and city remain high - though continue to fall - over a long&#13;
period. It is during this period that local manufacturing on a small scale&#13;
appears to be the more efficient alternative, and elsewhere we have used the&#13;
argument to explain the high rates of growth of mostly small-scale&#13;
manufacturing activities in regions where outputs and incomes in agriculture&#13;
are rising. 3/&#13;
Staley and Morse make the same argument with reference to the&#13;
following types of industries that are thought to hold "advantages of&#13;
location" for small scale production so long as transport costs remain high:&#13;
industries processing a dispersed raw material, and which reduce transport&#13;
costs by reducing the weight, bulk and handling difficulty at source; other&#13;
products that are heavy or bulky; products that are perishable and that must&#13;
be refrigerated during transport, transported quickly, or otherwise consumed&#13;
locally; and service and repair industries which by their nature must be&#13;
locally based. Examples: meat and dairy, preserves, canning, and the&#13;
processing of most food crops; furniture,sawmilling and wood products;&#13;
concrete blocks, pipes, bricks and other building materials.&#13;
These arguments are similar to those used in location theory to&#13;
explain the cost advantages of multi-plant operations of firms in the&#13;
industrialized countries. 4/ Suppose F (Q) represents the average costs of&#13;
production in a large firm, where Q is the size of its total market; F (Q) is&#13;
taken to decline with Q, i.e. with the total scale of production. In&#13;
producing for a small regional market of size q, with q being small relative&#13;
to Q, the total costs would be qF(Q) + RTq, where R is the average distance&#13;
between the factory and the market and T the unit transport costs. For a&#13;
1/ By Staley and Morse op. cit.&#13;
2/ Anderson and Leiserson (1980)&#13;
3/ Ibid, and Anderson and Khambata (1981).&#13;
4/ For a discussion, see Hay and Morris (1979) pp. 50-57.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
small local firm the costs would be a function of q (f (q) say). Hence so&#13;
long as transport costs outweigh the differences in production costs, F(Q) -&#13;
f(q), small local firms would hold the advantage.&#13;
It might be asked, therefore, why do not large firms set up branches&#13;
so as to circumvent T and compete with local producers? The answer is, of&#13;
course, that they eventually do, though the process appears to be gradual. In&#13;
part,this is because significant expenditures are required to establish the&#13;
branches, to acquire knowledge of local markets and to train local labor.&#13;
Local firms are highly adapted to the last two tasks; and in provinces&#13;
experiencing a rise in incomes and agricultural output, they have been found&#13;
to be highly responsive to the markets so generated. The study by Child and&#13;
Kaneda (1975) of makers of diesel-powered tubewell pumpsets in the Pakistan&#13;
Punjab provides a very good, and not an isolated example. 1/&#13;
Comparisons of the economic efficiencies of small and large firms&#13;
rarely examine these questions of location critically, though ignoring them&#13;
could seriously bias the results. Suppose, for example, the observations for&#13;
some small firms are significantly above the (least-cost) isoquant drawn&#13;
through the observations of the most efficient firms of an industry, all of&#13;
which, we assume, turn out to be of large scale. If the former are serving&#13;
the provincial markets that the latter have ignored on account of high&#13;
transport and marketing costs, it would be wrong to infer that they are&#13;
technically inefficient in Farrell½s (1975) sense of the term since presumably&#13;
the costs to large firms of producing for those markets would become&#13;
singificantly higher if they attempted to reach them before the&#13;
infrastructure, and also the size of the markets, had developed&#13;
significantly. The bias can be avoided by grouping firms according to&#13;
location or by comparing only those firms in the same location. In both cases&#13;
valuable insights can still be obtained, e.g. on relative technical or&#13;
managerial efficiency, but in the latter an important issue remains ignored.&#13;
A second explanation for the emergence of small firms relates to a&#13;
different set of activities,namely those in which subcontracting or local&#13;
assembly is common. 2/ Examples are to be found in a variety of machine-stop&#13;
activities, forging, foundry work, agricultural tools and equipment and&#13;
various capital goods industries. Cartillier (1975) provides examples in the&#13;
Indian state of Tamil Nadu of subcontracting in the production of electrically&#13;
powered tubewell pumpsets. The Japanese experience in promoting&#13;
subcontracting has also attracted considerable attention on the literature on&#13;
small industry 3/; but other cases are worth noting. In a survey of small&#13;
industries in India, Van der Veen (1973) noted "the pronounced commerical&#13;
1/ See also Anderson and Leiserson, op. cit.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
orientation of ... very small industrial units. These units are tightly&#13;
linked to the rest of the industrial economy of Gujarat State. They exhibit&#13;
strong forward linkages to other urban unregistered sector industrial units&#13;
and strong backward linkages to the entire industrial sector. The assumption&#13;
that (they) ... display only weak linkages to the rest of the industrial&#13;
economy is not supported."&#13;
Various reasons have been put forward to explain the extent and&#13;
growth of subcontracting. One is that it improves capacity utilization for&#13;
those parts of the process where the work is irregular or where the job cannot&#13;
be standardized ("job" orders). Another, which the Japanese political&#13;
economists, have stressed is that it enables large firms to avoid labor&#13;
problems during recessions 1/. It is politically easier to reduce orders than&#13;
to lay-off workers when demand falls.    Lastly, it also enables large firms to&#13;
avoid paying uniformly high wages under trade union pressure on all stages of&#13;
the production process. (Wages are significantly lower in small than in large&#13;
firms in developing countries, even allowing for age and skill&#13;
differentials. 2/)&#13;
A third explanation for the extent and growth of small firms in&#13;
developing countries, as in the now industrialized countries, is applied to&#13;
yet another distinct group of activities. They are put under the heading of "&#13;
differentiated products having low scale economies, and products serving small&#13;
total markets". 3/ Staley and Morse listed a variety of tailoring and&#13;
garments industries under this heading, plus speciality foods and handicrafts&#13;
industries. Also included might be "innovative activities" in which the&#13;
markets are still being established.&#13;
It is difficult to ascertain how far, in quantitative terms, each of&#13;
these "advantages" explains the apparently high rates of emergence of small&#13;
firms at a particular phase of the industrialization process - though the fact&#13;
of their emergence seems no longer doubted. There has been little advance&#13;
over what Staley and Morse and Shinohara (reviewing the Japanese literature)&#13;
had to say in the mid-1960s. For Korea, Ho (1980) recently followed the&#13;
classification of Staley and Morse, and attempted to identify all 5-digit&#13;
level industries which, on inspection, might be thought to hold one or more of&#13;
the above listed advantages for small-scale production. In each industry&#13;
chosen, small firms accounted for 50% or more of the total employment. His&#13;
results are summarized in Table 5 I have added the figures on small firm&#13;
employment in all other industries under the heading "no obvious advantage:"&#13;

Recall from Table 2 that Korea is in a phase where large firms are&#13;
increasingly dominating industrial production. Although much has been made of&#13;
the rapid growth of Korea's manufactured exports during and since the period&#13;
shown, Sen (1980) has suggested than much of her industrial growth has, in&#13;
fact, stemmed from the growth of domestic markets. This together with&#13;
improvements in infrastructure helps to explain the relative decline of small&#13;
firms previously having advantages of location. Ho remarks that "a number of&#13;
important industries in these categories in 1968 were no longer dominated by&#13;
small plants in 1975 .... small plant's share of employment in coal briquettes&#13;
was 80 per cent in 1968 and 49 per cent in 1975; in vegetable oils and fats,&#13;
it was 86 per cent in 1968 and 25 per cent in 1975; in bakery goods, it was 56&#13;
per cent in 1968 and 25 per cent in 1975. Apparently, improved transport&#13;
facilities and a greater concentration of population in large cities such as&#13;
Seoul, Busan, and Daegu permitted large enterprises to emerge and reduced&#13;
small establishments to a subordinate position."1/&#13;
One uncontroversial conclusion to be drawn from Ho's analysis is that&#13;
the composition of small-scale industries is in a continual state of change.&#13;
The various advantages described may hold over long periods, and may be&#13;
important, for example, in establishing a regional industrial base, drawing on&#13;
the markets generated by agricultural growth. Several authors have suggested&#13;
that this is the case, including Ho (1979) in an ealier analysis of rural&#13;
industries in Taiwan. 2/ But the advantages do not hold indefinitely, and any&#13;
further growth must be increasingly in competition with large scale (as is&#13;
also clear from the bottom row of the above table). As will now be seen, a&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

significant source of this competition probably arises from the growth of&#13;
small firms.&#13;
Eventual Predominance of Large Firms.&#13;
Several factors explain the eventual predominace of large firms in&#13;
advanced stages of industrialization: economies of scale with respect to&#13;
plant; economies of scale with respect to management and marketing; possibly&#13;
superior technical and management efficiency; preferential access to&#13;
supporting infrastructure services and external finance; and concessionary&#13;
finance along with investment incentives and tariff structures that in theory&#13;
are neutral between large and small scale, but in practice favor large&#13;
scale. It is beyond the scope of this paper to review these factors, on which&#13;
reference must be made to the standard texts. 1/ Instead, the following&#13;
question is discussed: to what extent is the increase in output and employment&#13;
that is recorded in large industry due to the expansion of previously small&#13;
firms through the size structure?&#13;
There has in fact been a lop-sided emphasis on the process of small&#13;
firm expansion in the small industry programs of many developing countries; by&#13;
tacitly identifying successful industrial entrepreneurship with those who have&#13;
established large corporations,they have sought to provide fixed capital and&#13;
supporting services to encourage enterprise expansion. Such policies overlook&#13;
the point that manufacturing activity in practically all countries is also&#13;
carried on by a large number of people who demand only those services that&#13;
will enable them to run their business efficiently on a small scale; the large&#13;
majority do not seek to expand their business. Nevertheless, a small minority&#13;
do, and significantly change the size structure of industry. Hoselitz&#13;
remarked that    ..... the small cottage and handicrafts establishments are&#13;
exceedingly vulnerable, and many of them disappeared altogether in the course&#13;
of time. Yet a sizeable number (in Europe and Japan)... did develop into&#13;
small and medium sized factories, and this process appears to be of special&#13;
importance in under-developed countries. Though it is well-known that in the&#13;
course of European industrial development the participation of craftsmen was&#13;
significant, and in some countries, indeed, indispensable, we know little&#13;
about the actual relative weight which may be assigned to the gradual&#13;
evolution of small handicrafts shops into medium and ultimately into large&#13;
plants".2/&#13;
1/ E.g. Hay and Morris, op. cit.&#13;
2/ Op. cit., p. 208 in Livingston (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
We still know little about the relative weights. The most concrete&#13;
source of evidence is provided by firm-level surveys, of which a large number&#13;
are now available on the origins and growth of firms in developing&#13;
countries.l/ The conclusions are familiar: firms practically always begin as&#13;
very small entities, with low amounts of capital drawn from the savings of the&#13;
owner or borrowings from friends and relatives; initial levels of employment&#13;
are low, typically less than a dozen, though the figure varies with the nature&#13;
of the business; the social and occupational backgrounds of the owners vary&#13;
greatly; and the firms that expand into medium or large scale activities do so&#13;
contiually or in steps. Expansion can be very fast for some firms, though the&#13;
growth rates appear as broadly distributed as their final sizes. 2/&#13;
It is difficult, however, to gross-up from these firm level surveys&#13;
to determine the precise contribution of small-firm expansion to the growth of&#13;
employment that is recorded under large industries. The source of the&#13;
difficulty is that industrial surveys usually publish information only on&#13;
establishments, not on firms, and consequently it is not possible to&#13;
distinguish between employment increases due to (a) firms that have&#13;
"graduated" into the large-firm category, (b) the branch expansion of already&#13;
large firms, and (c) increases in the average size of existing large&#13;
establishments. But it is possible to indicate what additional information is&#13;
needed, and suggest some orders of magnitude.&#13;
Table 6 gives the growth rates in the numbers of manufacturing&#13;
establishemnts according to size of establishment for six countries. (Note&#13;
the growing activity throughout the size distributions). Consider the largest&#13;
group. We need to determine how much of the increase in employment in this&#13;
group is due to the emergence of new, large establishments and how much is due&#13;
to the expansion of those already in the group. To make an estimate,&#13;
information is required on two quantities: the average size of the new&#13;
1/ See e.g. the papers and references in Kilby (1971) which provide a good&#13;
reading list of surveys done up to then, together with a review of what they&#13;
have to say on entrepreneurship. We have already cited the surveys of&#13;
Cartillier, Child and Kaneda, and Chuta and Leidholm. Some recent surveys&#13;
were undertaken by Mrs. Fajardo and myself in the Philippines and are&#13;
reporoted in Anderson and Khambata (1981a). Ho (1979) reviews a survey&#13;
undertaken by the Citizen's National Bank in Korea in 1971-73. My colleagues&#13;
in the World Bank, Mariluz Cortez and Messrs, Page and Mazumdar are in the&#13;
midst of reporting on some more recent survey work in Colombia and India.&#13;
2/ See table 5. In commenting on this section, Page noted some exceptions,&#13;
and remarked that the expansion of firms also depends on the policy&#13;
environment: " In Egypt, Yugoslavia and many African countries small firms do&#13;
not appear to grow through the size of distribution."&#13;
&#13;

establishments relative to the group average, and the fraction of new&#13;
establishments that have expanded into the group.l/&#13;
The average size of establishments graduating into the largest group,&#13;
relative to the group average, may well be greater or less than unity. On the&#13;
one hand it might be expected that firms newly graduating into the larger size&#13;
group would initially occupy its smaller "slots". But this is at variance&#13;
with the evidence available. Table 7 shows some interview data for India and&#13;
the Philippines from which it appears that even quite young firms may be among&#13;
1/ Let E, A and N represent the values of employment, average size of&#13;
establishment and number of establishments in the upper size group. Then&#13;
E = A.N.&#13;
and    AE   = AA.N.   +   A.AN&#13;
Let (1-f) be the share of the increase in N attributable to small firms&#13;
entering the upper size group so that f is the share due to the expansion of&#13;
already large firms. As noted in the text, the average size of establishments&#13;
may differ between new and already large firms; denote the averages by An and&#13;
Ae respectively, such that&#13;
AAN      A   (1-f) AN   +  A    f. AN&#13;
Substituting into the previous expression and dividing through by E gives:&#13;
4E      AA     Ae      AN       An          AN&#13;
E       A+A       .f.  N]+A        (-)      N&#13;
The bracketed expression on the RHS represents the rate of growth of&#13;
employment due to expansion of firms that were already large, before the&#13;
change AE; denote this by ge. The second term represents the rate of growth&#13;
of employment due to the entry of previously small firms into the upper size&#13;
group.  Denote   AE/E by g, AN/N by gN, and A n/A by an, and we have the&#13;
g  =   ge  +  an (1-f) gN&#13;
The contribution of newly graduating, previously small firms to the growth of&#13;
employment recorded in "large" industry is then an (l-f)gN/g. 100%. Values of&#13;
g can be found from table 2, and of gn from table 6.&#13;

the largest; there is no evidence to suggest that they occupy the smaller&#13;
slots, and they are probably responsible for much of the change taking place&#13;
within large industry.    In addition, large firms often contract.    In his&#13;
sample of 52 firms in Madras, Berna found that 1/ "most of (the) thriteen&#13;
oldest firms ... give every appearance of having reached the limit of their&#13;
growth. Seven of them are definitely in trouble and faced with prospects of&#13;
decline, or are already declining. Berry and Pinell-Siles (1979) provide&#13;
evidence on the contraction and growth of large firms in Colombia, again&#13;
revealing that contraction out of the largest size group is quite common.&#13;
The fraction of new large establishments in the group belonging to&#13;
already large corporations, as opposed to the fraction belonging to those&#13;
graduating into it, is an unknown quantity It doubtlessly varies between&#13;
countries, though it is difficult to obtain information that would provide a&#13;
reliable estimate. For the Philippines a rough estimate of the fraction was&#13;
made, based on inspection of the establishment listings and the trade journals&#13;
to ascertain the structure of ownership of industry 2/; it came to around&#13;
half.&#13;
Suppose, however, simply to convey a point, we take the value of the&#13;
fraction to be 0.5, the average size of the newly graduating large firms&#13;
relative to those already in the large scale group to be unity, and see what&#13;
is implied. Using the data in Tables 2 and 4, the shares in employment&#13;
expansion in the large industry group, attributable to the growth of small&#13;
firms through the size distribution, would then be 3/: Korea 40%, Taiwan 53%,&#13;
Turkey 45%, Colombia 70%, Philippines 42%, and India 67%.     If f were higher,&#13;
say 0.75, or'a] lower, say 0.5, these estimates would then be halved, ranging&#13;
from 20% for Korea to 35% for Colombia. The contribution of small firm&#13;
expansion to the development of large industry could therefore be&#13;
appreciable. However, its precise significance will remain unknown until&#13;
better data are forthcoming.&#13;

Summary&#13;
To sum up the argument so far, employment in household manufacturing&#13;
was seen to decline first in relative and then in absolute terms as&#13;
industrialization proceeds. This observation is neither new nor surprising,&#13;
but those who have studied the nature and composition of household&#13;
manufacturing have shown that the aggregate trends conceal the extra-ordinary&#13;
diversity of these activities and of the changes taking place. Many&#13;
activities contribute appreciably to incomes and employment, and may expand&#13;
rapidly in some high growth engineering and consumer goods industries. In&#13;
these respcts, as King noted 1/ "recent research has been correct to note the&#13;
side effect of informal activity upon raising the standard of living of&#13;
peasant (and presumably urban) families."&#13;
As regards small workshops and factories, the available evidence&#13;
suggests that they emerge rapidly in response to the growth of markets - at&#13;
least in periods before industrialization is in an advanced phase. Although&#13;
more evidence and analysis is required to improve our understanding of the&#13;
factors involved, the markets generated by agricultural growth, in regions&#13;
where the labor force is predominantly rural, is probably the main&#13;
explanation, together with the conditions of infrastructure and transport in&#13;
those regions. This implies, of course, that the nature of the agricultural&#13;
development strategy is exceedingly important in determining both the size and&#13;
the regional distributions of industrial development; further material on this&#13;
theme is disccused in Part III.&#13;
While large scale industry eventually predominates as indus-&#13;
trialization proceeds, much of its growth appears to be rooted in the&#13;
expansion of once small firms through the size distribution. The evidence on&#13;
this, however, is not as forthcoming as one would wish; there is still much to&#13;
be ascertained, for instance, about the extent of ownership of manufacturing&#13;
establishments by already large domestic and foreign corporations. That the&#13;
contribution of the growth of small firms to the development of large industry&#13;
becomes appreciable, however, as industrialization proceeds, is not disputed&#13;
by those who have studied the origins of firms. If this conclusion is&#13;
correct, it is all the more remarkable given the exceedingly unequal ways in&#13;
which industrialization and financial policies have favored large-scale in&#13;
most developing countries; the material on this subject is also considered in&#13;
Part III.&#13;

II THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP ISSUE&#13;
The above evidence would seem to suggest that entrepreurship, or the&#13;
lack of it, is proving not to be a constraint on the growth of developing&#13;
countries. In a recent review Leff (1979) summed up this position as follows:&#13;
"... pessimism about entrepreneurship in LDCs was caused by a serious&#13;
identification problem.    Absence of entrepreneurship in earlier periods was&#13;
generally attributed to deficiencies in the supply of entrepreneurship due to&#13;
alleged socio-cultural rigidities. In the postwar (and increasingly post-&#13;
colonial) period, however, structural changes occurred, notably with more&#13;
buoyant aggregate demand and heightened government support for development.&#13;
With these new conditions generating a sharp rightward shift in the demand&#13;
schedule for entrepreneurship, the supply response has been sufficiently&#13;
elastic to permit the high rates of economic development that we have&#13;
observed." For this reason, entrepreneurship is held to be a "slack&#13;
variable." 1/ But the important qualification is added that its supply is&#13;
concentrated among a small "group" of industrialist-cum-bankers, who are a&#13;
product of inherited wealth, connections with government, and monopoly profits&#13;
made possible by concessionary finance and the structure of tariffs and import&#13;
controls. It is thus suggested that development can be promoted with the&#13;
"standard tools" of the economist, which appear to include "oligopoly theory&#13;
for the distortions created by the Groups, and monopoly theory for state&#13;
enterprises," and more generally, efforts to bring prices into alingment with&#13;
opportunity costs.&#13;
Measured in terms of the numbers of people having established small&#13;
or large firms in developing countries, in regions of market growth, the&#13;
evidence supports Leff's conclusions regarding the elastic supply of&#13;
entrepreneurship. It is also indisputable that the bulk of financial&#13;
resources and an array of concessionary policies have been concentrated on a&#13;
small group." But it is necessary to qualify these conclusions in two&#13;
respects; in the second of these it will be seen that Leff's review provides&#13;
us with a useful springboard for further analysis, and it is not the intention&#13;
to dispute his central conclusion regarding the elasticity of the&#13;
entrepreneurial response, but rather to raise questions about its efficiency.&#13;
First, it is apparent that the response is not confined to a small&#13;
group, as the evidence in Part I shows. The group theory does not receive&#13;
support, in this respect, from studies of the origins and growth of small and&#13;
1/ The term "slack variable" originates in Linear Programming, and indicates&#13;
the existence of a non-binding constraint. A slack variable is the difference&#13;
between the amount of a resource that is actually available and the amount&#13;
that is actually used - in the above case, in the optimum economic policy. In&#13;
principle all non-binding constraints can be ignored in the search for an&#13;
optimum policy if it is known in advance that they are non-binding, i.e. if&#13;
more resources than will be neded are available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
large firms. It is more correct to argue that a small minority of mostly&#13;
large firms benefit from preferential incentive and financial policies, but&#13;
that the response of smaller ones - outside the "group" - to the growth of&#13;
markets has nevertheless been highly elastic. The emergence and growth of&#13;
small industries discussed in Part I suggests this argument, but more concrete&#13;
evidence is provided in numerous surveys on the backgrounds of people who have&#13;
established either small or large firms in developing countries. Over twenty&#13;
years ago Berna concluded that 1/&#13;
"The most striking point which emerges from&#13;
the preceding case studies [of medium scale&#13;
industries in Madras] is the extremely varied&#13;
background of the entreprenurs who have&#13;
organized the enterprises under study. It is&#13;
evident that entry into industry is open to&#13;
persons of very different social standing and&#13;
economic position. This finding is somewhat&#13;
unexpected in one of the less developed&#13;
regions of a country where traditional&#13;
occupations and caste play an important part&#13;
in determining economic status ... It has not&#13;
been possible to correlate entrepreneurs'&#13;
performance with social or economic&#13;
background. Enterprising and capable&#13;
industrialists are found in all groups."&#13;
Surveys in several other countries since then have reached similar&#13;
conclusions, 2/and the biographical sketches provided by Berna and in later&#13;
studies do not support the view that industrial entrepreneurship is found&#13;
predominantly among the privileged, though economic policies have undoubtedly&#13;
favored the latter.&#13;
Second, the supply response among all groups in neither as full nor&#13;
as efficient as it might be. 3/ Direct evidence on this point is provided in&#13;
1/ Berna (1960).&#13;
2/ See Kilby (1966 and 1971).    There are interesting parallels also with&#13;
historical studies of entrepreneurship in the industrial revolution. Payne&#13;
(1974) quotes Ashton who showed that "the pioneer industrialists' came from&#13;
every social class and from all parts of the country."&#13;
3/ Or as Dhar and Lydall (1960, p. 28) argued, "while there is evidence of a&#13;
shortage of efficient entrepreneurs, especially those capable of running&#13;
medium and large enterprises, there is no overall shortage."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
studies of "technical" inefficiencies in firms, in the sense of the term&#13;
originally defined by Farrell (1975).1/ LeCraw (1979) has provided recent&#13;
evidence on the differing levels of technical efficiency in 400 firms in&#13;
Thailand together with a comment on studies in several other countries; it&#13;
provides convincing evidence of the scope for increasing the efficiency of&#13;
entrepreneurial services in developing countries by other than - or rather in&#13;
conjunction with - the "standard tools" of the economist. A related argument&#13;
is that of Leibenstein (1966, 1978) on the "X" inefficiencies that arise in&#13;
the industrialization process. It will be recalled that these are the&#13;
inefficiencies that are thought to arise from the observed non-cost minimizing&#13;
behavior of firms, and from differences in objectives between owners and&#13;
workers in the firms. They can, in a sense, be seen as a particular source of&#13;
"technical" inefficiency, and we shall consider Leibenstein's arguments&#13;
further below.&#13;
Apart from inefficiencies in firms actually existing, it is important&#13;
not to overlook those factors that preclude many people from establishing&#13;
firms at all. Examples are inadequacies in the provision of education and&#13;
training, and in the supply of capital. They are aspects of the so called&#13;
"barriers to entry" argument, and remind us of the point that practically all&#13;
the economists' observations on entrepreneurship have been based on&#13;
questionable sampling procedures: they have considered only successful&#13;
cases. There is comparatively little known about those who attempted but did&#13;
not succeed, or about those who might well have succeeded, but were not in a&#13;
position to contemplate the attempt.&#13;
Let us consider these issues further; that is, issues related to&#13;
(i) the efficiency of firms actually existing, or that actually existed but&#13;
failed, and (ii) barriers-to-entry. The conclusion to emerge is that it is&#13;
appropriate not to treat entrepreneurship as a "slack variable," but rather to&#13;
examine what constraints and inefficiencies might exist in its supply, and how&#13;
1/ Recall from Farrell's article that economic efficiency can be divided into&#13;
two components:&#13;
(1) Technical efficiency, which measures how close a firm is to cost-&#13;
minimizing behavior for a given level of output; it is measured&#13;
at a constant set of factor proportions; and&#13;
(2) Price efficiency, which measures how close a firm's choice of inputs&#13;
is to the optimum choice for given factor prices.&#13;
Thus (1) measures how close a firm is to its isoquant, and (2) how close it is&#13;
to the optimum point on the isoquant. We shall use the term technical&#13;
efficiency in Farrell's sense. The term economic efficiency embraces (1) and&#13;
(2) plus an additional factor, namely the efficiency of prices (i.e. the&#13;
correspondence between the prices and opportunity costs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
they might be addressed in the interest of improving employment and earnings&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
To begin, the term entrepreneurship is too broad to be useful, except&#13;
as a subject heading for papers and abstracts. As it stands it cannot be&#13;
defined precisely enough in a manner that lends itself to measurement, and in&#13;
practice definitions have varied greatly between authors. 1/ If however we&#13;
follow Kilby 2/ and see it not as a homogenous, binary variable that is either&#13;
"present" or "absent" in developing countries, but as a generic term embracing&#13;
several attributes and functions of those who start up, run, expand or even&#13;
contract businesses, the possibilities for measurement and analysis become&#13;
clearer.&#13;
It is convenient to distinguish between those functions related to&#13;
the making of investment decisions to establish or expand a business, and&#13;
those related to the running of the business after the investments are&#13;
installed. If we examine Kilby's list of the functions of an entrepreneur,&#13;
the following can be classified on the investment side 3/: identifying market&#13;
opportunities (novel or imitative), developing and introducing the method of&#13;
production, overseeing the installation of the investments, and dealing with&#13;
the public bureacracy (concessions, licences). The following can be&#13;
classified on the management side: the time spent on marketing and procuring&#13;
inputs; on customer and supplier relations; on procuring and managing finance;&#13;
on recruiting, training and managing workers; on various aspects of&#13;
maintenance and production control; on searching for ways of reducing costs&#13;
and improving products and production methods; and, in management as in&#13;
ivestment decisions, dealing with the public bureacracy (taxes, licences,&#13;
factory safety, labor laws etc).&#13;
Leibenstein distinguished between two types of entrepreneurship, and&#13;
which appear to be closely related to the above classification of investment&#13;
and management functions. 4/ The first was the "innovational entrepreneurship&#13;
necessary to create (or carry on) an enterprise where not all the markets are&#13;
well established ... or in which the relevant parts of the production function&#13;
are not completely known." The second is the "routine entrepreneurship" of&#13;
managing an established concern. But the two are not independent, since those&#13;
who set up or expand a business must be prescient of the subsequent management&#13;
1/ E.g. Baumol excludes the management functions of an entrepreneur,&#13;
Leibenstein includes them. Leff chose not to discuss them. For a discussion&#13;
of what earlier writers have meant by the term see Kilby's book. Op. cit.&#13;

tasks. Moreover, particularly in smaller businesses, they may have to provide&#13;
or direct the management of the business themselves, and a failure to do so&#13;
efficiently may lead to a failure of the business, however innovative and&#13;
well-conceived the investment. Hence there seems no good reason for&#13;
concentrating on one aspect more than another when considering the efficiency&#13;
of the entrepreneurial response.&#13;
In general terms it might be argued that people are likely to&#13;
establish or expand a business if the expected present value of private&#13;
returns exceeds the expected present value of private costs perceived by the&#13;
owner. For this argument to be approximately true, however, it is necessary&#13;
to take a broad view of costs and returns. The most obvious factor&#13;
influencing the investment decision, it would seem, is expected profits, which&#13;
we might write as:&#13;
(i)           Expected present value of sales minus the sum&#13;
of material costs,the costs of hired labor,&#13;
and the costs of working and fixed capital;&#13;
since practically all owners put significant&#13;
shares of their own savings into their&#13;
business, the capital costs include the&#13;
earnings stream expected if these savings were&#13;
invested elsewhere.&#13;
But for most people, expected profits alone would not be the only factor&#13;
entering the investment decision. In small firms most proprietors must commit&#13;
a substantial share - often the whole - of their working hours to the running&#13;
of the business. Hence the earnings in and the desireability of alternative&#13;
forms of employment will be considered too. In addition, expectations of&#13;
profits would not be unconditional (in the statistician's sense of the&#13;
term). The profits that are expected if the business succeeded need to be&#13;
weighed against the losses and all the attendant personal costs that might&#13;
arise if it did not. These considerations point to four other factors&#13;
entering the investment decision, and reveal that the investment is likely to&#13;
be undertaken if the expected profits (assuming the business does not fail) is&#13;
greater than the sum of 1/&#13;
(ii)          the earnings expected from alternative forms&#13;
of employment (or from not expanding the&#13;
business). These are presumably related to&#13;
the level and trends of wages in related&#13;
occupations, or to incomes in alternative&#13;
1/ Both John Page and Peter Kilby commented that while this classification is&#13;
not incorrent, it is a bit unconventional since one would normally include&#13;
(ii) and (iv) in the expected profit streams. I agree with this, and have&#13;
retained the classification only in order to identify the various elements&#13;
bearing on the decision in more detail.&#13;

forms of self-employment; the decision to&#13;
establish a small firm, for example, is&#13;
sometimes less a matter entrepreneurship in&#13;
the sense of Leibenstein's first definition&#13;
(given above) than it is a product of poor&#13;
employment opportunities;&#13;
(iii)         the inputed value of running one's own (or a&#13;
larger) business as against working for others&#13;
(or running a smaller business). This&#13;
represents a subjective adjustment on the part&#13;
of the owner to (ii); it is apparently&#13;
influenced by attitudes and values acquired&#13;
during youth or in response to political and&#13;
social circumstances 1/;&#13;
(iv)          the expected financial losses if the business&#13;
(or the investment) fails. This represents an&#13;
objective or certainty-equivalent measure of&#13;
risk; and&#13;
(v)           the inputed cost of risk-taking, in addition&#13;
to any losses expected under (iv); this term&#13;
represents an additional loading for possible&#13;
departures from risk-neutral behavior.&#13;
In a large company, (i) and (ii) and (iv) may be estimated&#13;
explicitly, more or less on the lines recommended in the standard texts on the&#13;
analysis and finance of capital projects 2/ with the other factors being&#13;
weighed in committee or at board.   In small firms, accountants, if accountants&#13;
are used, may encourage some estimate of (i), and in practice may be prepared&#13;
to help in making the estimates and to advise on other matters such as are&#13;
listed under (ii) to (v). But in the majority of firms, they are not&#13;
considered explicitly. The above classification is intended simply highlight&#13;
those factors that appear to be important in business decisions, and to&#13;
identify potential sources of inefficiency in the decisions actually observed.&#13;
The classification applies in principle both to the establishment of&#13;
new and to the expansion of existing firms. But in practice there are&#13;
important differences of degree between the two cases. In particular, the&#13;
uncertainties and difficulties involved in the former are appreciably greater:&#13;
in general, there is a substantial commitment of family savings, the markets&#13;
and the returns to the investment are highly uncertain, the present form of&#13;
employment will have to be given up, the products and the methods of&#13;

production still have to be proven, and the proprietor may have little&#13;
experience in the hiring, training and the management of labor. Hence&#13;
departures between expectations and what can be realized in practice may be&#13;
much greater in the former case, and it is not surprising to find higher&#13;
failure rates among new businesses. In contrast, those expanding a going&#13;
concern will have addressed many of these problems, and the decision to expand&#13;
is generally based on an already established and growing market for the firm's&#13;
products.&#13;
Inspecting each term in turn, it is possible to identify several&#13;
instances in which economic inefficiencies might arise. First, there are&#13;
those that are external to small firms; they arise from policies and programs&#13;
outside any firm's control, and have attracted considerable attention in the&#13;
literature on industrial and agricultural development. They will be&#13;
considered further in Part III, but to list them briefly: - (a) The aggegate&#13;
demand for manufactured goods may be lower than is economically desirable:&#13;
e.g. on account of deficiencies in macro-economic policy, or in agricultural&#13;
regions in which a bimodal development strategy is being pursued. 1/ (b) The&#13;
prices of products and factors may depart from their efficiency values: e.g.&#13;
on account of the structure of industrial tariff and investment incentives&#13;
policies. (c) The absence of institutions to reduce or insure against risks&#13;
may lead to investments not being made even when expected discounted revenues&#13;
exceed expected discounted costs. 2/ (d) Information services on markets,&#13;
supplies or more generally on the state and prospects of business activity may&#13;
be under-developed, leading to broad departures between expectations and&#13;
realizations. (e) The firms may, and generally do, encounter inefficiencies&#13;
in the supply of inputs, e.g. in the supply of infrastructure services and&#13;
finance.&#13;
The instances that have received more attention in the literature on&#13;
small industry, however, are those related to the internal inefficiency of the&#13;
firms themselves, in the choice and scaling of the investments, and in the&#13;
running of business. Numerous reports on firm-level surveys are available on&#13;
this subject, which it is impracticable to review here. For our present&#13;
purposes it is sufficient to quote and comment on some of their findings.&#13;
Among the most commonly discussed deficiencies of small firms in&#13;
developing countries is the lack of an accounting base for the planning and&#13;
management of the business. This is partly due, no doubt, to the point that&#13;
the accounting profession itself is undeveloped in most countries and can&#13;
offer satisfactory services to only a small number of firms. Even in&#13;
countries where they are available, however, they are little used and seem&#13;

only to be turned to when the payment of taxes can no longer be avoided, or&#13;
when a bank loan is required and it is the bank's policy not to lend unless&#13;
audited statements are available. Ho (1980, p. 83), for instance, notes that&#13;
less than one third of firms with 20-49 workers in Korea practice double entry&#13;
book-keeping, and less than one half have any recognisable form of record-&#13;
keeping at all. Mrs Khambata and I noted a similar situation in the&#13;
Philippines, where much of the work of the extension and advisory service is&#13;
being addressed to this problem. 1/ If anything, small firms in Korea and the&#13;
Philippines are better in this respect than most developing countries. Page&#13;
(1979), p. 29) notes that, in Africa,"surveys of small firms universally find&#13;
that the majority of entrepreneurs fail to keep even rudimentary financial&#13;
records. The quality and extent of book-keeping efforts appear to improve&#13;
with size of firm, but even for those firms maintaining some form of&#13;
accounting system the records are frequently deficient and not regularly&#13;
consulted as a management tool"&#13;
Hence a valuable means for the monitoring and control of a business&#13;
is not widely used, or even recognized, reducing the owner's capacity both to&#13;
manage existing investments efficiently and to anticipate the future costs and&#13;
yields of new investments. This might not be important for minor investments,&#13;
but it is if significant additions to buildings, equipment and hired labor are&#13;
being contemplated. Moreover, the lack of attention to accounting and record-&#13;
keeping is symptomatic of several other problems that may arise as a business&#13;
expands. Consider two steps in the expansion of a business.&#13;
The first is what Hoselitz described as "the crucial step in ... the&#13;
attainment of a plant size exceeding that of the dwarf [household]&#13;
enterprise." 2/ As noted earlier, several surveys have shown that the large&#13;
majority of firms begin as "dwarf" enterprises, in which production is&#13;
undertaken by family members, often part time by the principal income earner&#13;
(so that an alternative source of income is available), and on the premises of&#13;
the household (so that overheads are negligible). In addition, products are&#13;
made in small amounts and often to order; relatively little capital is tied up&#13;
in inventories and accounts receivable; and the costs and returns of the&#13;
enterprise may not be separated from the household budget. All these factors&#13;
change significantly if it is decided to set up a small workshop or factory,&#13;
say with ten to twenty employees. Labor has to be hired and trained, with all&#13;
the attendant problems ofmanaging worker relationships; fixed overhead costs&#13;
and inventories rise significantly; the alternative source of income is given&#13;
up; working capital is required to finance inventories, work in progress and&#13;
accounts receivable, amounting to 50 - 70 per cent of the asset structure of&#13;
most small industries 3/; and separate and well-kept accounts become highly&#13;

- 41 -&#13;
desirable for the management and control of the business. It is presumably&#13;
the new kinds of skills required to handle such changes that leads Leibenstein&#13;
to the view that significant X-inefficiencies arise in the transition from&#13;
family to non-family forms of commercial activity. It is certainly not&#13;
difficult to imagine inefficiencies of one form or another arising, or that&#13;
they account for a significant fraction of the reportedly high failure rates&#13;
among small businesses.&#13;
The second step is one in which the firm may expand into a yet larger&#13;
entity of, say, twenty to fifty workers or more. In this step, overheads, the&#13;
demand for working capital and the dependence on hired labor all grow more or&#13;
less pari pasu with the size of the firm, and in themselves introduce no&#13;
change of structure, as in the first step. Where structural changes do occur,&#13;
however, is in the organization and management of the business. On this, it&#13;
is difficult to improve on the following observations of the Bolton Report on&#13;
Small Firms in Britain (1971), which one frequently hears expressed - in&#13;
astoningshingly similar terms - by extensionists and other working in&#13;
association with small industries in developing countries: 1/&#13;
"One of the outstanding characteristics of the&#13;
small firm is the simplicity of its management&#13;
structure. The typical small firm is directly&#13;
managed by its owners, who themselves take&#13;
nearly all important decisions and probably&#13;
oversee their execution as well . . . This&#13;
direct dependence on the proprietor in every&#13;
facet of running the business is the source of&#13;
most of the strengths, and many of the&#13;
weaknesses, of small firms. It accounts, for&#13;
example, for the rapidity with which decisions&#13;
can be taken ... On the other hand, the skills&#13;
and experience of any one man are necessarily&#13;
limited. The majority of small firm&#13;
proprietors have no professional or other&#13;
formal qualifications and only a tiny minority&#13;
have specific qualifications in management.&#13;
They run their business on the basis of their&#13;
experience and commonsense. This may be very&#13;
effective so long as the scale of the firm's&#13;
activities remains small enough for one to&#13;
control them all effectively, and so long as&#13;
no serious crisis overwhelms his pragmatic&#13;
management. Either of these eventualities,&#13;
however - significant growth or a need to&#13;
consider drastic changes in the firm's policy&#13;
- is likely to reveal a need for certain&#13;
I/ Op. cit., p. 112.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
specialist skills which are most unlikely to&#13;
be found within the average small firm."&#13;
It is easy to overstate the advantages of introducing formally&#13;
acquired management and accounting skills into an expanding businesses, either&#13;
through training, though hiring the people with the requisite skills, or&#13;
simply through contracting some of the work out (as is common with&#13;
accounting). Furthermore, while shortcomings in one aspect of a business&#13;
(e.g. in its accounting procedures) may deprive it of access to other services&#13;
(e.g. to finance from the commercial and development banks), they may still&#13;
not inhibit its successful expansion.   Numerous biographies and case studies&#13;
are available on successful entrepreneurs who developed their business&#13;
independently, and indeed were noted for it. Businesses are also observed to&#13;
"mushroom" in response to market growth whether or not they are supported by&#13;
the organized financial sector, or whether or not their owners acquired the&#13;
necessary management skills. But this argument ignores the issue of economic&#13;
efficiency, and also the demands of firms that do seek the means and the&#13;
services that would enable them to improve their prospects. While biographies&#13;
provide a source of inspiration, by their nature they are about exceptional&#13;
people, and do not provide a scientifically representative sample. Evsey&#13;
Domar (1968) remarked that "for every business hero who has caught the&#13;
scholar's eye, there must be scores of others who have lost their shirts," and&#13;
appealed for hypotheses to be tested on evidence drawn from successes and&#13;
failures.&#13;
Domar's criticism also applies to the large majority of case studies&#13;
of small and large firms in developing countries. By studying only businesses&#13;
actually exsiting, they provide a blinkered view of the sources and efficiency&#13;
of entrepreneurship. It is interesting to see the same criticism raised with&#13;
respect to historical studies of entrepreneurship in the industrialized&#13;
countries, for example by Payne (1974) in Britain: ". . . it is becoming&#13;
increasingly clear that earlier assessments of the entrepreneur ... have&#13;
reflected a biased sample. If nothing else, there is a possibility that the&#13;
majority of records that have been located and 'worked' ... are predominantly&#13;
those of concerns that were sufficiently successful to have created conditions&#13;
favorable for untypical longevity" 1/&#13;
Nevertheless, within these limited samples, most observers argue that&#13;
there is a serious and enduring technical efficiency problem in the lower size&#13;
ranges. It is unnecessary to review this literature here since several&#13;
admirable reviews are already available, e.g. by Kilby, Page, and LeCraw. 2/&#13;
1/  Op. cit., pp. 30-31.   On p. 33 Payne adds that ".... the names that have&#13;
become famous ... were not typical entrepreneurs. The majority of them&#13;
conducted their operations on a scale much greater than their less well-known&#13;
competitors."&#13;

economists and sociologists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43   -&#13;
Kilby-s review covers studies undertaken in several countries over a long&#13;
period; the following are his own observations on entrepreneurship in&#13;
Nigeria 1/&#13;
"Although there has been some improvement over&#13;
a twenty-year period with accumulated&#13;
experience and rising levels of&#13;
entrepreneurial education, the problem remains&#13;
a crippling bottleneck to industrialization&#13;
based on indigenous entrepreneurial resources&#13;
... In the baking industry the writer&#13;
documented the loss of three-quarters of&#13;
potential profits to raw materials wastage,&#13;
damaging of bread during baking, and extensive&#13;
employee pilferage. Lawrence Okigbo found&#13;
that over half of Nigeria's sawmills were&#13;
operating at less than 50 per cent efficiency&#13;
during the hours in which they were in use;&#13;
and Harris and Rowe report that, combining&#13;
efficiency with hours utilized, 'most Nigerian&#13;
sawmills are producing only 10 to 10 per cent&#13;
of the lumber that the installed machines are&#13;
capable of producing.' Comparable magnitudes&#13;
of underutilization were found in the rubber&#13;
creping industry.&#13;
"The factors which lie behind such poor&#13;
performance are, on the production side,&#13;
failure to regularly maintain equipment,&#13;
inadequate co-ordination of raw material&#13;
pruchases with product orders, a&#13;
disinclination to utilize written records for&#13;
purposes of control, and the absence of&#13;
conscientious supervision in the workplace."&#13;
A survey of engineering units in Howrah came up with almost identical&#13;
conclusions: "139 out of the 200 units have no organization for production,&#13;
purchases, sales, accounts and auditing ... only 15 have regular auditing&#13;
arrangements. The organization of sales and purchases is even more deplorable&#13;
... Much of the task of organization is thus left to the owner/manager to&#13;
manage as best he can" (Banerji, 1964, p. 75). These were firms with 60&#13;
employees each on average, often working without technical or other&#13;
supervision except that provided by the owners themselves. It is added that&#13;
(p. 76-77) "the haphazard way in which [the units] have been allowed to grow&#13;
cannot escape notice. We have already commented on poor factory space. This&#13;
1/ Op. cit., 1971, pp. 30-31.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
is made worse by the haphazard layout of machines and the absence of any&#13;
systematic storage space for raw materials and finished parts which are strewn&#13;
all over the place. It is often difficult to walk without stumbling on them."&#13;
In his survey of the literature on Africa, Page noted: 1/ "There is&#13;
a tendency for more successful firms to be over-capitalized, particularly to&#13;
maintain excessive stocks of raw materials ... Investment in equipment is&#13;
similarly excessive or misdirected in a significant number of firms." Mrs.&#13;
Khambata and I reported a similar tendency for small firms to over-invest in&#13;
the course of expansion in the Philippines. 2/    Our observations were based on&#13;
an ex post study of small industry investments financed through the private&#13;
and public banks; two thirds of those financed had over-estimated their&#13;
initial sales levels by more than 100%, and in consequence were saddled with&#13;
excess capacity, high overheads and dangers of bankruptcy; in fact, many did&#13;
go bankrupt.&#13;
More formal estimates of technical inefficiency are provided in the&#13;
econometric studies of LeCraw (cited above) and Page (1980), both of whom&#13;
refer to the earlier work of Pack (1974, 1976), Bergsman (1974) and others.&#13;
Examining firm-level data on the wood and furniture industry in Ghana, Page&#13;
attempted to identify the variables that might explain why the costs of some&#13;
firms are significantly higher than others. He concludes that 3/ "variations&#13;
in managerial effort and ability are significant factors in explaining a&#13;
firm's position relative to the industry production frontier. Technical&#13;
inefficiency is not simply a reflection of differences in the physical&#13;
environment and errors of measurement and specification. It also reflects the&#13;
important influence of an excluded variable, management, from the production&#13;
function .... efforts to increase the level of education of managers with&#13;
regard to technical aspects of the production process, more intensive&#13;
supervision of labor, and policies designed to increase the utilization of&#13;
installed capacity should yield benefits in terms of improved economic&#13;
performance and reduced social costs." Using ex ante data (that is to say,&#13;
projected sales and costs) for a sample of firms in Thailand, LeCraw also&#13;
found significant inefficiencies arising from the uncertainties associated&#13;
with various technologies. For this reason, his policy suggestions include 4/&#13;
"more extensive information for prospective investors on appropriate&#13;
technology and training for managers, engineers and workers in its use." Both&#13;
Page and LeCraw suggest that the overall gains from reducing technical&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
inefficiencies may be comparable to those that would arise from the&#13;
elimination of factor and product price distortions in many countries. 1/&#13;
All the studies so far cited have drawn on interviews with firms&#13;
still exsiting. Very few have attempted to compare successes with failures&#13;
among the owners of small (or large) firms. They examine only existing firms&#13;
that are by and large successful. In this sense they have over-estimated&#13;
entrepreneurial efficiency. A noteworthy exception is a study by Itao (1980),&#13;
who actually made the attempt. His results show a strong and negative&#13;
association between bankruptcy rates and the adoption of rudimentary but&#13;
professionally recognized management and accounting practices in small firms.&#13;
Apart from comparing successful with unsuccessful entrepreneurs, it&#13;
is also necessary to compare both with members of the labor force who do not&#13;
establish businesses. The latter include those who do not so out of personal&#13;
preference, and those who cannot contemplate the attempt because they lack the&#13;
initial capital or the necessary education and experience. The available&#13;
surveys of small industries are not very helpful in addressing this issue, for&#13;
the reasons given earlier, but even a cursory inspection of the evidence is&#13;
sufficient to indicate its importance.&#13;
The point is often made for example that the initial capital&#13;
requirements of setting up a small firm are small. Initial investments in the&#13;
range $500 to $5000 in today's prices are not untypical in developing&#13;
countries. 2/ These figures, however, neglect working capital requirements to&#13;
pay wage labor, to meet family needs and to pay for materials while the&#13;
business is becoming established, a point made over twenty years ago by Sen&#13;
(1958). But if we multiply the figures by two or three to allow for working&#13;
capital, the amounts would still be small by the standards of a Western&#13;
observer or of those in the upper income groups in developing countries.&#13;
Furthermore, surveys have repeatedly revealed a remarkable ingenuity among the&#13;
owners of small firms to economize on capital costs by renovating second-hand&#13;
equipment or by making the equipment themselves (e.g. Banerji, 1964). In&#13;
consequence it is often suggested that capital is not a "barrier to entry"&#13;
into small business. 3/ This conclusion, however, does not rest an objective&#13;
1/ Most developing countries, in fact, have accepted that technical&#13;
Tnefficiencies exist in small (and in large) firms for some time, and have&#13;
introduced advisory, extension and management training programs to address the&#13;
problem. See e.g. World Bank (1978b, Chapter 4). As noted in Part III, these&#13;
programs vary greatly in approach, and what is now needed is a comparative&#13;
analysis of how they are working out.&#13;
2/ See e.g. Barna, Kilby (1965 and 1971) and Anderson and Khamabata, cited&#13;
earlier.&#13;
3/  It should be emphasized that this is not suggested in the papers cited&#13;
above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

analysis. The initial investments, however small they may appear to those&#13;
interpreting the survey results, range from several months to several years of&#13;
the family incomes of the majority of the labor force, and in some cases may&#13;
exceed a lifetime's income. This is not to suggest, of course, that simply&#13;
making credit available in small amounts would lead to a "mushrooming" of&#13;
small firms. Given all the other factors that are referred to as being&#13;
important for eliciting an entrepreneurial response - the growth of local&#13;
markets, factor and product price distortions that do not make the businesses&#13;
unprofitable, and the availability of infrastructural and educational services&#13;
- this is most unlikely. But it is to suggest that, where such factors are&#13;
not unfavorable, inefficiencies in the supply of capital will lead to&#13;
inefficiencies in the response.&#13;
Similarly, it was noted earlier that people with poor eduations, and&#13;
having had little or no formal training, often succeed in establishing&#13;
profitable firms. Many case studies are available in the surveys of small&#13;
industries cited above. However much one might admire such people it does not&#13;
follow that a lack of education and training is not a "barrier" for others.&#13;
Thus if we examine Itao's sample of firms in the Philippines, over 80 per cent&#13;
of the owners had completed secondary or higher education (the percentage did&#13;
not differ significantly between businesses that had gone bankrupt, and&#13;
businesses still operating) as compared with 40 per cent for the labor force&#13;
as a whole. Similarly, Berna's sample of medium scale firms included several&#13;
owners with the most humble and poorly educated backgrounds; 1/ but as a whole&#13;
they were much better educated than the mass of the Indian labor force at the&#13;
time of the study. These remarks are of course not sufficient to reveal the&#13;
precise significance of education in entrepreneurship; the information&#13;
required for a formal multi-variate analysis are not readily available; but&#13;
they do suggest that its significance cannot be assessed unless one considers&#13;
a broader sample, to ascertain the circumstances and backgrounds of those who&#13;
are not part of the measured entrepreneurial response.&#13;
To sum up, regions of rapid market growth have so far generated a&#13;
remarkable entrepreneurial response in developing countries. But the response&#13;
is neither as full nor as efficient as it could be, and in this sense it is&#13;
wrong to regard entrepreneurship as a slack variable, i.e. as a variable that&#13;
can be ignored by those involved with development policy. It is not as full&#13;
because a large share of the labor force lack the background and the income&#13;
even to contemplate setting up small firms and expanding them; this point has&#13;
been missed by practically all available surveys of small and large firms&#13;
because they have concentrated only on those people who became successful&#13;
entrepreneurs, and did not consider the rest of the labor force. That it is&#13;
not as efficient as it could be becomes clear once one considers the elements&#13;
of the entrepreneurial function is more detail, on both the investment and the&#13;
1/ Op. cit., Chapter III.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
operating sides of a business. This conclusion has been supported by&#13;
empirical studies of technical efficiency, and by those who have observed the&#13;
workings of small and large firms. All this is in addition to inefficiencies&#13;
in the capital markets, in the structure of industrial incentives, and in&#13;
policies towards agriculture, each of which may greatly hamper the&#13;
entrepreneurial response in developing countries. We now turn to these&#13;
issues. The implication is that growth could be significantly greater than&#13;
has been experienced so far; in this respect our conclusion is even more&#13;
optimistic than Leff's.&#13;

III SMALL INDUSTRY PROGRAMS AND THEIR RELATION TO DEVELOPMENT POLICY&#13;
Small industry programs in developing countries may include several&#13;
or all of the following elements: the provision of short-and long-term&#13;
finance; industrial extension and advisory services; management training; -&#13;
vocational training; specialized trading and technical services (common in,&#13;
but not confined to, handicrafts); various measures to promote sub-&#13;
contracting; and infrastructure services and industrial estates. In broad&#13;
terms these programs are intended to address a number of issues that were&#13;
referred to above, e.g. regarding technical inefficiency and deficiencies that&#13;
are thought to arise in the supply of financial and other services. They have&#13;
been introduced in a large number of countries. Their designs also vary&#13;
greatly, as one can infer from a huge and diverse literature on the&#13;
subject. 1/&#13;
There is, in fact, little that is new to be said on what kinds of&#13;
programs to pursue and how to design and implement them. The literature and&#13;
the files of the various ministries and development institutions involved are&#13;
replete with guidelines and recommendations, often dating back over 20 or more&#13;
years. Practically all of this material is ex ante in that it is concerned&#13;
with the preparation of the programs and what they were expected to achieve.&#13;
It served a necessary purpose in the 1950's and 1960's when the programs were&#13;
being introduced.&#13;
The following presents an ex post analysis of small industry&#13;
financing programs, drawing on project experience in several countries, and&#13;
noting some parallels with agricultural credit. Since extension services are&#13;
a necessary adjunct to these programs, some comments are also added on&#13;
these. For those interested in other ex post studies covering other aspects&#13;
of small industry development, reference should be made to the work of Kilby&#13;
on industrial centers in Kenya 2/, and of Somesekhara (1975) and Alexander&#13;
(1963) on industrial estates in India.&#13;
As noted in the introduction, a broader issue than the precise&#13;
design of the programs themselves is how the efficiency of the programs is&#13;
affected by the structure of development policy in general. In all, there are&#13;
three aspects to this issue, and which are to be considered below. The first&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
relates to financial intermediation, and is discussed in the section dealing&#13;
with small industry finance; it is how the supply of finance is affected by&#13;
the prevailing administrative controls on interest rates and the borrowing and&#13;
lending of financial intermediaries. The other two relate to industrial&#13;
incentives and to policies towards agriculture.&#13;
Financing Programs&#13;
Small industries in developing countries have little access to the&#13;
resources of the organized financial sector. Some small firms receive&#13;
finance, but in practice they belong to a small minority of owners of good-&#13;
standing, already having access to the financial sector and who arguably do&#13;
not need to support of special financing programs. Economists with&#13;
substantially different perspective on the subject of development have&#13;
converged on the same conclusion as to the apparent cause. In his review of&#13;
the role of market mechanisms and planning in the development process, Myint&#13;
(1971) cites Myrdal to sum up both the cause and the cure. 1/ "The way to&#13;
gradually break dfown dualism in the credit market would seem to be, first to&#13;
increase interest rates substantially in the organized market and second, to&#13;
decrease or eliminate the subsidies involved in public lending to the&#13;
traditional sector.... If credits in the traditional sector were placed on a&#13;
business basis, so that the volume of credit could be expanded without cost to&#13;
society, the state could more seriously compete with the usurious&#13;
moneylenders, and the average interest rate would eventually be lowered.....&#13;
It is worth noting that in Japan,where the rural and small scale industrial&#13;
sectors are much more integrated (more than half of all agricultural credit is&#13;
provided by financing institutions), interest differentials are much smaller:&#13;
on the average, interest rates are lower in the traditional sector, but&#13;
considerably higher in the full organized sector than in India and Pakistan."&#13;
As we have argued elsewhere, however, this arrangement in itself&#13;
would not be sufficient to achieve an efficient allocation of financial&#13;
resources between large and small industries. 2/ Instead we have argued for a&#13;
policy in which:&#13;
(a) interest rates would reflect the estimated&#13;
costs of lending to low-risk small firms; and&#13;
in which&#13;
(b) the losses incurred while the institutions&#13;
are developing the screening procedures to&#13;
identify low risk firms, and also the&#13;
procedures to maintain repayment discipline,&#13;
would be absorbed by the financing programs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5Q -&#13;
The former could be accomplished by relaxing administrative controls&#13;
on the level and structure of interest rates. But given the initially high&#13;
risks and administrative costs involved in lending to large numbers of small&#13;
industries, the financial intermediaries must either face the political&#13;
problems of either charging exceedingly high interest rates or accepting&#13;
significant losses over a long-period. Both are likely to be resisted, and&#13;
hence the importance of (b). An explicit assumption in this policy is that&#13;
both the risks and the administrative costs would decline to comparatively low&#13;
levels once the intermediaries have developed the capacity and the screening&#13;
procedures to lend to small industry. Let us elaborate further on these&#13;
points.&#13;
First consider the initial magnitude of the risks and what these&#13;
would imply for a risk-reflecting interest rate policy. Let p denote the&#13;
fraction of the total principal and interest owing on the loans that it is&#13;
expected will not be repaid. If r denotes the interest payment per unit of&#13;
principal, then the total principal and interest expected to be recovered,per&#13;
unit of principal, is (1 - p) (1 + r). Similarly let i be the interest&#13;
payment on raising resources and "a the administrative costs of handling the&#13;
loans, each again being expressed per unit of principal loaned. Then for&#13;
lending to show positive expected profits it is necessary that&#13;
(1l-p)    (1 + r)   &gt;   (1 + i)   +  a&#13;
or                        r     &gt;   (i + a + p) / (1 - p)       (1)&#13;
Note that this expression applies to term-loans if the interest&#13;
rates are specified for the maturity of the loans; e.g. if the loans are for n&#13;
years on average then r and (i + a) would be n-year interest rates. (The&#13;
quantities r, i and a are also nominal, and would have to be deflated if it is&#13;
desired to work in real terms). However, it is sufficient to consider the&#13;
case of short-term loans.&#13;
Reports on existing lending programs for small industry reveal that&#13;
p varies greatly between one program and another; we have noted instances&#13;
where it was less than 10%, and others 60% or more. 1/ Bottomley (1975)&#13;
reports similarly wide variations in the default rates on agricultural&#13;
credit. It is instructive to consider three examples, say values of p = 0.1,&#13;
0.2 and 0.5 respectively, and see what the above formula implies. In real&#13;
terms, i might be around 5% for developing countries at the present time,&#13;
allowing for the costs of borrowing and providing for reserves. The&#13;
administrative costs vary appreciably, but in round numbers a = 5%       is not&#13;
untypical. 2/ Putting these figures into the above formula gives: -&#13;
1/ Anderson and Khambata, op. cit,., 1981a, Chapters 2 and 3.&#13;
2/ See e.g. Saito and Villanueva (1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
r  =   (0.05  +  0.05  +  0.1)   /  0.9  =  22%;&#13;
r  =   (0.05  +  0.05  +  0.2)   /  0.8  =  37%; and&#13;
r  =   (0.05  +  0.05  +  0.5)   /  0.5  =  120%&#13;
In contrast, the r for larger firms, or for small firms with established&#13;
credit ratings, for whom values of p = 0.02 or less and a = 0.02 or less are&#13;
typical, would be around 9%.&#13;
On the basis of current experience, therefore, the commercial rates&#13;
of the financing institutions would have to rise, at first glance, to the&#13;
"usurious" levels of informal sector lenders if they were to expect a&#13;
profit. The reason is that the interest payments of those who actually repay&#13;
the loans must cover the lost principal and the lost interest on those who do&#13;
not. Hence the force of Rothschild and Stiglitz's argument that "high-risk&#13;
individuals cause and externality: the low-risk individuals are worse off than&#13;
they would be in the absence of high risk individuals". 1/&#13;
It is apparent that if interest rates began to rise to such levels,&#13;
they would extinguish any interest on the part of the institutions in meeting&#13;
the demand - quite apart from the political problems of introducing sizeable&#13;
differentials between large and small borrowers. First, high interest rates&#13;
would cause many would-be borrowers with projects having expected returns&#13;
appreciably above the opportunity costs of capital to cut back on or ignore&#13;
the possibilities of investment entirely; the institutions may, in addition,&#13;
rightly or wrongly, believe that few projects with such high returns could be&#13;
found, and would not be prepared to attempt to identify them. Such arguments&#13;
are fimiliar from the paper by Akerlof (1970) on the market for "lemons".     It&#13;
is only when the institutions have accumulated information and lending&#13;
experience over a long period that this is unlikely to happen. Stiglitz and&#13;
Weiss (1981) have made the additional point that as interest rates rise the&#13;
risks become greater because they attract the riskier and deter the more&#13;
conservative borrowers; in addition, contingency margins on existing projects&#13;
would be greatly reduced. As interest rates rise beyond a certain point,&#13;
therefore, expected revenues decline on account of the rise in p, and there is&#13;
the possibility that the interest rate chosen would not clear the market; that&#13;
is we are still left with a system of administered credit.&#13;
An alternative would be for the institutions to accept losses for a&#13;
period in the expectation of satisfactory returns in the long-run. But this&#13;
option in precluded for two reasons. First, the acute lack of reliable&#13;
information on small industries in developing countries leads to significant&#13;
differences of perception as to the long-run profitability of lending to&#13;
them. Information on the sectoral and regional distributions of small&#13;
industrial activities is exceedingly poor, and the apparent growth of such&#13;
activities in certain phases of the industrialization process is neither&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
widely appreciated nor its causes understood by those responsible for&#13;
policy. Until recently, there was some theoretical support for the view that&#13;
in modernizing agricultural regions, small industrial activity would decline&#13;
as infrastructure improvements and the growth of markets favoured external,&#13;
large scale manufacturing._1/ In Part I it was suggested that the opposite&#13;
was the case over a particular phase of the industrialization process - though&#13;
this view too was qualified on account of the poor quality of information&#13;
available. Hence it would not be surprising if expectations of profits&#13;
differed greatly (and were often lower) than what more information might show&#13;
could be realized. In fact, to address the information problem it is&#13;
sometimes suggested that the advisory and extension services could be involved&#13;
in the task of monitoring trends and changes in the nature of small industrial&#13;
activity.&#13;
Second, there is the problem posed by the attitudes of institutions&#13;
to risk, and the apparent divergence between the objective functions of the&#13;
financial institutions and the objective function suggested by economic&#13;
analysis. When risks are high this divergence is important. The managers&#13;
involved in administering the programs are exceedingly reluctant to report&#13;
significant losses in the portfolios for which they are responsible, even if,&#13;
as lending and screening procedures are improved, those portfolios are&#13;
eventually expected to be profitable. Ghandi (1977) has summed up this&#13;
situation well in remarking that, for any large institution, "given a&#13;
situation where the benefits of risk-taking do not accrue directly to&#13;
managers, but the potential costs of criticism under failure are very real, it&#13;
is no wonder that safety is so often sought in orthodoxy and in following&#13;
precedent... The crucial importance of examining the objective functions of&#13;
the institutions to be influenced, and of devising schemes consistent with&#13;
these functions, cannot be overstressed."2/&#13;
The practical effect, therefore, of simply removing administrative&#13;
controls would be for institutions not to lend rather than charge high&#13;
interest rates, on the one hand, or face significant short-run losses in the&#13;
uncertain expectation of long-run profits on the other. The above mentioned&#13;
externality then takes the form of potentially low risk and efficient&#13;
investments in small industry being excluded from access to institutional&#13;
finance entirely. For this reason there seems no option but to require the&#13;
involvement of the public banks in lending to small industry, and to encourage&#13;
the involvement of the private banks through various risk-guarantee and&#13;
rediscounting schemes. This argument is widely accepted by those involved in&#13;
industrial finance 3/, but tends to be overlooked in the economists arguments&#13;
1/ As in the paper by Hymer and Resnik (1969). For a later discussion, see&#13;
Leidholm (1973) and Anderson and Leiserson (1980).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

for an elimination of concessionary finance. Consequently, it seemed&#13;
desirable to bring the arguments up-to-date.&#13;
Three issues remain: how are moral hazards associated with the risk-&#13;
guarantee schemes to be avoided? what interest rates are appropriate? and can&#13;
the risks and administrative costs, as assumed above, be expected to&#13;
decline? Consider each in turn.&#13;
Moral hazards arise from the possibility of the financing&#13;
institutions passing on the losses to the government, under the guarantees&#13;
agreed upon, rather than attempting to improve procedures and reduce the&#13;
losses over time as intended by the programs. The way this is sometimes&#13;
avoided is as follows. The institution is expected to make good a certain&#13;
percentage of losses due to default, so that there is always an incentive to&#13;
reduce losses. The permitted spreads (e.g. in the rediscounting facilities)&#13;
are such, however, as to make lending profitable, given the expected losses,&#13;
and thus tempt the instituion into the program. As losses decline, therefore,&#13;
the spreads offer increasingly generous profits. Furthermore, as they&#13;
decline, there is the prospect of lending profitably out of resources raised&#13;
through deposits and private borrowings.&#13;
As regards the interest on lending, in the limiting case the optimum&#13;
rate, from an economic point of view, can be shown to converge on the&#13;
following value 1/&#13;
1/ See Anderson and Khambata, op. cit., (1981b). Briefly, it is derived as&#13;
follows" -&#13;
Let Q be the total volume of lending, and (l-p) Q = q be the portion going&#13;
to "good" projects. Also let B (q) the willingness of the proposers of these&#13;
projects to pay principal plus interest, which we take to be a measure of&#13;
benefits; the expected rates of return on the projects will be greater than or&#13;
equal to the rate of interest charged, r. Hence the willingess to repay&#13;
principal plus interest on a marginal amount dq will be (l+r), from which it&#13;
follows that dB/ dq = (l+r). The net benefits are:&#13;
B(q) - (1 + i + a )Q&#13;
Differentiating through with respect to Q (the first term implicitly) gives:&#13;
(1 + r)    [ (l-p)  -  QdP/dQ ] - (l+i+a) - Qda/dQ&#13;
Setting this equal to zero gives the marginal conditions, from which the&#13;
interest rates to be charged for an economic optimum is&#13;
r  =  i+ a + p + Qda/dQ    +  Q dp/dQ&#13;
1 - p - Qdp/dQ&#13;
The terms Qda/dQ and Qdp/dQ are both negative, and represent the benefits of&#13;
reductions in administrative costs and risks respectively, from a marginal&#13;
increase in lending. The learing curves might be represented, for instance,&#13;
by: -&#13;
- bQ&#13;
p = p* + p** e&#13;
where b is a constant, (p* + p**) represent the intial risk levels, and p* the&#13;
lower limit of the risks; p* would correspond to the "natural" risks of&#13;
lending to low risk borrowers. Analogous remarks apply to a*. The larger the&#13;
value of Q, the closer r tends to expression (2) in the text.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 54 _&#13;
* *&#13;
r     i+ a   +   p                   (2)&#13;
1 - p&#13;
where p* represents the (low) expected default rates attributable to the&#13;
"natural" risk of financing low risk borrowers, and a* the (low)&#13;
administrative costs, also of financing low risk borrowers. To gauge from the&#13;
records of the financial intermediaries, p* is typically 2% or less, but may&#13;
be higher for long-term loans. In practice, (2) implies interest rates only&#13;
moderately higher than those that would apply in lending on a commercial basis&#13;
to large borrowers. As noted earlier, it is unlikely in any case that large&#13;
differentials between small and large borrowers would be tolerated&#13;
politically.&#13;
The intuitive explanation for (2) is as follows. The right hand&#13;
side represents the marginal costs of lending to those categories of borrowers&#13;
that it is desirable to finance, namely those intending to repay the loans,&#13;
and with projects in which the expected rates of return are above the&#13;
opportunity costs of capital. As noted earlier, it is the initial&#13;
difficulties of distinguishing between these borrowers and the "lemons" that&#13;
drive the imputed interest rates up to the levels implied by (1), which is a&#13;
strictly financial criterion. With the accumulation of information and&#13;
experience as lending procedes, however, there is an increasing likelihood of&#13;
"good" projects being financed, and it is the external benefits of this&#13;
process that provides the economic justification for setting interest rates&#13;
below those determined by purely financial considerations. 1/&#13;
Extension Services and The Demand for Credit: A Comment.&#13;
The development of screening procedures within the financial&#13;
institutions is only one of several difficulties in meeting the demand for&#13;
credit, and many developments external to the institutions are required for an&#13;
efficiently functioning financial system. As Ghandhi observed in a study of&#13;
financing institutions in Sri Lanka, "there are no widely acceptable and&#13;
reliable credit rating agencies so that the data on credit risk, pooled and&#13;
systematized from a variety of sources, are not available. In addition, other&#13;
than the public joint stock companies and possibly some of the larger private&#13;
companies, customers rarely maintain accounts in a form, style and accuracy&#13;
which would give outsiders an accurate picture of their operations. Finally,&#13;
the problems of monitoring loans are very great, and expensive in terms of&#13;
qualified manpower, so that banks seek to simplify operations and reduce costs&#13;
and risks by recourse to easily identifiable security." 2/ However, even this&#13;
simplification is precluded in most countries by the absence of legally&#13;
acceptable documentation on assets held. Falsification of documents related&#13;
to ownership, as of accounts, is not uncommon, making them worthless for&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
purposes of loan appraisal and security. Finally, the exceedingly poor&#13;
backgrounds and educations of many small business proprietors may make them&#13;
reluctant to seek institutional credit, or add greatly to the transactions&#13;
costs that they and the institutions face if such credit is sought.&#13;
For these reasons an extension program is an indispensible element&#13;
in the financing of small industry, even if the loans are to be offered on a&#13;
commercial basis. They are required so long as the institutional and legal&#13;
framework for an efficient functioning of the financial sector is under-&#13;
developed, and so long as the transactions costs remain a serious obstacle.&#13;
They are intended to improve documentation, and to absorb part of the&#13;
transactions costs faced by both the borrowers and the lending institutions.&#13;
It is obvious that they cannot be expected to undertake the whole task, say,&#13;
of improving accounting procedures within small industries or the quality of&#13;
documentation on assets; but by disseminating information on what is required&#13;
and by acting as referral services for the specialized agencies, they may&#13;
greatly facilitate the process. 1/&#13;
In economic terms, the justification for these types of services&#13;
runs as follows. Without them, small industries are restricted to self-&#13;
finance and high cost borrowings from the informal sector. Projects with&#13;
rates of return above the marginal cost of capital raised by the organized&#13;
financial sector thus remain unfinanced. With the services, the economic,&#13;
benefits are two-fold: a savings in cost for those activities that would&#13;
otherwise use the high-cost alternative, and additional economic output from&#13;
those projects that otherwise would not have been undertaken. Advisory&#13;
services run in parallel with extension are intended to provide a third source&#13;
of benefit. This is to address the sources of technical inefficiency&#13;
discussed in Part II. In the more familiar terms of cost-benefit analysis,&#13;
the first two benefits correspond to a fall in the marginal cost schedule for&#13;
the supply of capital, and the third to an outward movement of the marginal&#13;
efficiency of capital schedule. (Figure 3). It is necessary to compare these&#13;
with the costs of the services provided when undertaking an economic&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
It is obvious that the justification of the programs depends on the&#13;
extent of the demand for credit in that the larger the demand the more&#13;
desirable it is to introduce the financing and extension services. In this&#13;
connection the point is often made that small industries are either&#13;
financially self-sufficient or are able to turn to trade credits and other&#13;
informal channels. There is an irony here in that, for reasons discussed at&#13;
length above, they have no option but rely on these resources. However, the&#13;
point remains that the demand for institutional credit may be small, and&#13;
raises the question of the size of the "market" for the services provided by&#13;
small industry programs. Furthermore, financial self-sufficiency and a&#13;

reliance on informal borrowings are not without advantages. With reference to&#13;
concessionary finance in industrial development centers in Kenya, King&#13;
remarked that the bulk of machinery so financed:&#13;
"is far beyond the range of the&#13;
enterprising and successful workers in&#13;
the informal sector of the economy. And&#13;
this is not merely that they do not own&#13;
workshops to which electricity can be&#13;
brought (indeed there are a sizeable&#13;
number who have power available in their&#13;
premises, but still cannot afford to put&#13;
anything at the end of the cables); it is&#13;
that even the hand operated imported&#13;
machinery is beyond the sort of cash that&#13;
petty entrepreneurs are likely to have in&#13;
the hand at any one time ... the style of&#13;
machines associated with the centers is&#13;
so capital intensive that the previous&#13;
suggestion for bringing entrepreneurs to&#13;
these places .... seems unlikely to be&#13;
effective."In contrast, "Given the&#13;
practical exclusion of the vast bulk of&#13;
informal operators from the world of&#13;
loans, it is not surprising that a number&#13;
of artisans have begun to edge their way&#13;
into devising machines of their own, to&#13;
facilitate certain processes, and to&#13;
enable them to make new products ....&#13;
their training and lack of resources have&#13;
made improvisation a virtue." 1/&#13;
Such observations reveal, however, not the absence of demand, but a&#13;
failure of concessionary finance to meet it. Since both fixed and working&#13;
capital are indispensible elements in any business activity, the issue is not&#13;
whether the demand for finance "exists," but what are the most efficient&#13;
channels of supply. On this, it is apparent that the answer differs greatly&#13;
between industries and on the precise scale of (small scale) activity. On the&#13;
latter, recall that small industries may range from artisanal and household&#13;
enterprises employing one or two workers; to small workshops and factories&#13;
with significant fixed and short-term assets, employing 10 to 20; to larger&#13;
entities with up to 50 or more. Yet all but a small minority are excluded&#13;
from access to institutional finance. While informal sources may be ideal for&#13;
small borrowings of short maturity, they cannot be expected to serve, e.g.,&#13;
the demands for term-loans in the larger (small) firms. To take another&#13;
example, in the cloth and garments industries the demands are greater for&#13;
working than for fixed capital, and, given the nature of the product, are most&#13;
1/ King, op. cit., p. 25.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 58 _&#13;
frequently met through trade credits. In other industries (e.g. in&#13;
engineering) small firms may have to offer rather than receive trade credits&#13;
as can be seen from the high proportions of working capital tied up in&#13;
accounts receiveable 1/; in addition, their demands for fixed capital are&#13;
greater, and for both reasons may seek supporting finance from the commercial&#13;
and development banks.&#13;
What is required, therefore, is responsiveness from all channels,&#13;
and not an exclusive reliance on one or the other. For this reason, small&#13;
industry financing and extension prograras to address the risk and structural&#13;
problems described above are a desirable element in industrial development&#13;
policies in those regions where there is a significant demand for the&#13;
services.&#13;
Small Industry Programs and the Employment Issue&#13;
As noted in the introduction, the renewed interest in small industry&#13;
in developing countries stems largely from the widespread concern over&#13;
unemployment. Practically all reports on the subject in recent years appeal&#13;
to the greater labor intensity of small firms and, on this account, to the&#13;
importance of channelling a greater share of investment towards them.&#13;
Although there is some ambiguity as to whether, within narrowly defined&#13;
sectors, small firms are more labor intensive than large firms, the former are&#13;
more concentrated in the labor intensive industrial sectors. 2/ Hence it&#13;
remains that, by increasing the possibilities for investment Tn small firms,&#13;
the financing programs discussed above are relevant to the aim of reducing the&#13;
capital intensity of industry overall since they implicitly favor the more&#13;
labor intensive industrial sectors.&#13;
What is more questionable about the programs, however, is the&#13;
tendency in many countries to support only those firms that are "creating&#13;
jobs." This is revealed, for instance, in a preference for financing fixed&#13;
over working capital, and for financing enterprises that are expanding&#13;
employment over those seeking modernization without such expansion.&#13;
Furthermore, projects with high incremental capital-labor ratios are commonly&#13;
rejected on the grounds that insufficient jobs are being "created" by the&#13;
investments.&#13;
Such conditions place an unnecessary constraint on what the programs&#13;
might otherwise accomplish. Furthermore, they can be observed both to work&#13;
against the aims of improving employment opportunities and to increase the&#13;
risks of financing small industry.   Consider first the employment issue, which&#13;
1/ See e.g. Kennett (1979), Shetty (1963) and Banerji (1963).&#13;
2/ See Ho (1980), Berry and Pinell-Siles (1979) and Anderson and Khambata&#13;
(1981a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
can be dealt with briefly by reference to the findings of those who have&#13;
surveyed a huge literature on the subject. 1/&#13;
The most general finding is that the issue relates less to the lack&#13;
of employment than to the conditions of employment for the large majority of&#13;
the labor force, as was the case historically in the now industrialized&#13;
countries. The conditions include long working hours; exceedingly low&#13;
remuneration and commensurately low labor productivities; poor health and&#13;
safety standards; and generally a lack of purpose in the work other than its&#13;
being an exceedingly arduous means of subsistence. In fact, reviews of the&#13;
admittedly poor evidence available frequently reveal low levels of&#13;
unemployment, though the situation varies between countries. Inspecting the&#13;
evidence for fourteen countries, Gregory (1980) notes "First, in no country&#13;
has there been an unambiguous increase in open employment; and second, it is&#13;
difficult to discern any definite trend in the course of unemployment". 2/&#13;
This finding is not surprising given the absence of systems of&#13;
compensation for unemployment in developing countries. In this situation, as&#13;
Stewart put it, being unemployed cannot be "afforded" by the large majority of&#13;
the labor force 3/, who have no option but to resort to long hours of arduous&#13;
and unpleasant work in wage and family labor in which the earnings are driven&#13;
down, by the prevailing labor demand and supply conditions, to and below&#13;
subsistence levels. Hence Stewart's conclusion that the employment issue that&#13;
has been identified by labor economists is one of "relatively low income work"&#13;
which "bears no relationship to the original concept of unemployment.&#13;
Analytic (and policy) confusion is created by the use of the term with the&#13;
implicit assumption that the cure for the problem as with the cure for Western&#13;
employment, is the creation of jobs. The obvious cure for low productivity is&#13;
not the creation of more jobs, but improvements in productivity." 4/&#13;
If this conclusion is accepted, then it follows that the right&#13;
projects to support are those generating a satisfactory return to the&#13;
investments - whether or not an expansion of employment or of fixed assets is&#13;
involved. There is a qualification to this argument in that, from an economic&#13;
point of view, it is the social not the private returns that are relevant; but&#13;
this does not undermine the point that the programs need to be responsive to a&#13;
wider class of demands, e.g. for working capital finance, or for term loans to&#13;
raise labor productivity in various ways. As shown in Part I, an appreciable&#13;
number of small firms in developing countries do seek to expand output and&#13;
employment; insofar as the programs address the constraints on the supply of&#13;
finance to facilitate the expansion of these firms, they are responsive to the&#13;
employment issue discussed above. However, a larger number of firms invest to&#13;
raise output and labor productivity necessarily without increasing employment,&#13;
and may even eliminate it in the low-productivity, low wage, and also more&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
60 -&#13;
labor-intensive activities - particularly if the situation arises where real&#13;
wages are rising. Excluding these types of investments from a program, as&#13;
with the exclusion of working capital finance,necessarily limits its scope in&#13;
addressing the employment issue.&#13;
It was also noted that the sorts of loan conditions mentioned above&#13;
increase the risks of finance. The most conspicuous cases of this arise where&#13;
the finance of working capital and of trading firms are excluded from the&#13;
programs. As many have argued, there are several reasons why working capital&#13;
finance is inherently less risky to supply: there are fewer market&#13;
uncertainties about the investment, and indeed the demand is often related to&#13;
firm job orders; it relates to current and more proven operations of the&#13;
business; the borrower generally requires access to it regularly, enters into&#13;
a continuing business relationship with the bank, and thus becomes more&#13;
familiar with and to the branch staff; and given the need for subsequent loans&#13;
the incentive to repay current loans is greater. This is of course not to&#13;
argue for the other extreme - avoiding long-term finance - but rather for a&#13;
better balance between the two where one or the other is currently avoided.&#13;
As regards trading firms, apart from being important sources of output and&#13;
employment in themselves, they provide relatively low risk conduits for the&#13;
supply of working capital to small industry.&#13;
To sum up, small industry financing programs and their supporting&#13;
advisory and extension services are addressing an important constraint on the&#13;
efficient flow of financial resources to industry. But the frequent practice&#13;
of imposing restrictions on the types of activities and assets to be financed&#13;
needlessly impairs their effectiveness in addressing the employment issue.&#13;
Policies Towards Agriculture and Industry.&#13;
In discussions on small industry programs, the point is often made&#13;
that the aims of improving employment opportunities could best be met through&#13;
an appropriate choice of industrial tariffs and investment incentives, and&#13;
through a broadly based development of agriculture. These are, of course,&#13;
among the principal instruments at a government's disposal for raising output&#13;
and the demand for labor. However, as the preceding analysis has sought to&#13;
show, small industry programs are not intended to be an alternative to more&#13;
desirable policies towards agriculture, or towards raising output and the&#13;
demand for labor in industry; instead, they are intended to serve a&#13;
complementary purpose by addressing specific sources of market failure that&#13;
would, indeed, limit the effectiveness of such policies. In the present paper&#13;
we have considered only one source of market failure, namely that arising in&#13;
the capital markets; and it is clear that interventions to address this&#13;
problem become more relevant the less the prevailing policies depress output&#13;
and incomes in small scale activities. But the point does raise the issue&#13;
that what small industry programs can accomplish depends greatly on the nature&#13;
of policies towards agriculture and industry.&#13;
The evidence now available suggests, in fact, that in most countries&#13;
small industries would stand to gain appreciably from the reforms now widely&#13;
proposed for these policies. Consider first the programs proposed for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
broadly based development of agriculture. 1/ The design of these programs&#13;
must of necessity vary with the political and the initial economic and social&#13;
conditions of a region and with the capacity of institutions to implement&#13;
programs of varying "intensity" and coverage. But in general terms they have&#13;
the common aim of raising output in small-farmer agriculture through&#13;
addressing the issue of land tenure, improving cropping practices and seed-&#13;
fertilizer varieties in both rain fed and irrigated areas, extending&#13;
irrigation, improving infrastructure, and providing the supporting credit and&#13;
extension services. At one time it was argued that such investments in&#13;
agriculture would provide little stimulous to industrial development through&#13;
"linkage effects," or alternatively, would generate demands for externally but&#13;
not locally manufactured goods. But these arguments have not stood up to&#13;
empirical analysis. 2/ First, they under-estimated both the income&#13;
elasticities of demand for non-food goods and services in rural areas, and the&#13;
capacity of such investments to raise rural incomes. Second, it has become&#13;
apparent that the types and quantities of goods demanded by the large majority&#13;
of the population in rural areas and towns can be met through local small-&#13;
scale production, as noted in Part I. Third, the tasks of modernizing and&#13;
maintaining output in agriculture itself were shown to generate a broad range&#13;
of demands for processing services and locally manufactured inputs. For these&#13;
reasons, small industry programs extending out to agricultural provinces are&#13;
seen in the studies just cited to be an economically desirable adjunct to&#13;
agricultural development programs. 3/&#13;
Consider next the long-standing proposals to eliminate non-tariff&#13;
barriers against imported manufactured goods, to reduce and make more uniform&#13;
existing tariffs, and to eliminate concessional finance to industry. 4/ As&#13;
noted in the introduction, and as has been thoroughly documented in the&#13;
references cited, the prevailing policies of industrialization in the large&#13;
majority of developing countries were expressly intended to foster the&#13;
development of large scale industry, notwithstanding the evidence that small-&#13;
scale industry would continue to provide the bulk of industrial employment&#13;
over long periods. Hence it is almost tautological to argue that a shift&#13;
towards more neutral policies would benefit small-scale industries (and thus&#13;
make the programs intended to assist them more effective). But it might be&#13;
useful to sum up why; there are at least three reasons.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

First, the proposals mentioned would neutralize what has perhaps&#13;
been the main side effect of the policies, which is the huge shift of&#13;
investment away from agriculture into industry. Given an improvement in the&#13;
domestic-of-trade for agriculture's products, and a rise in investment in&#13;
agriculture, rural incomes should rise -and with this the demands in the&#13;
provincial markets for manufactured goods. As we have seen, small industries&#13;
in particular are highly dependent on - and responsive to - these markets.&#13;
Second, the available evidence from the countries that have followed these&#13;
proposals, when contrasted with the evidence from those that have not, has&#13;
confirmed the theoretical predictions of a more rapid growth of both domestic&#13;
and export markets; both small - and also large - industry have been shown to&#13;
gain from this.&#13;
Third, they would reduce what Myint aptly described as "the&#13;
glaringly unequal terms on which capital funds, foreign exchange and economic&#13;
services provided by government are made available to the two types of&#13;
manufacturing industry...These policies may be said to protect the larger-&#13;
scale modern factories not only from foreign competition but also from the&#13;
domestic competion of the small-scale economic units. Thus it would seem&#13;
reasonable to expect that a reduction in the unequal access to scarce economic&#13;
inputs between the larger-scale and small economic units would make the latter&#13;
more competitive and increase their share of economic output, thereby&#13;
raisingthe proportion of labor to capital employed in the manufacturing sector&#13;
as a whole." 1/ It is hard to improve on this statement. Much of this paper&#13;
has in fact been concerned with the difficulties of providing small industry&#13;
with more equal access to economic inputs, and pointed to the likely gains.&#13;

IV CONCLUSIONS&#13;
When considered in terms of their contribution to employment and&#13;
earnings, the continuing interest in small industries, among those concerned&#13;
with development policy, seems justified. Indeed, the issues ahead no longer&#13;
relate to the "singificance" of small industries but to the effects of various&#13;
policies and programs upon them. Over long periods of the industrialization&#13;
process, employment in household manufacturing, and in small workshops and&#13;
factories, far outweighs that that is (or that could be) provided by large&#13;
industry, notwithstanding the huge concentration of investment and of&#13;
supporting services on the latter over the past twenty to thirty years.&#13;
Part I reviewed the main reasons for this and outlined the changes taking&#13;
place. Since a short summing up was provided at the end, no further comments&#13;
are necessary here.&#13;
The conclusions to the analysis on entrepreneurship, in Part II,&#13;
have also been summed up previously. Suffice it to recall that while the&#13;
entrepreneurial response to market growth is highly elastic, according to the&#13;
available evidence, the managerial or "X" inefficiencies associated with the&#13;
response are appreciable, and most of those who have studied the subject have&#13;
supported the idea of training and advisory programs to address the problem.&#13;
In fact, many countries have such programs.&#13;
Turning to programs of support for small industries,several issues&#13;
arise. The most general one, as noted variously above,concerns the shortage&#13;
of ex post evaluations of the many programs that have been undertaken in&#13;
developing countries.   Even particular aspects of these programs, such as the&#13;
provision of training and advisory services, vary greatly in approach between&#13;
one country and another, and it is obvious that there would be much to be&#13;
learned from a comparison of the experiences of different countries. In&#13;
Part III, an attempt was made to examine finance and extension, based on&#13;
project work in several countries. Large gaps in our knowledge remain,&#13;
however, e.g. with respect to infrastructure and management and worker-&#13;
training programs, to mention three.&#13;
With respect to small industry finance, several parallels with the&#13;
findings of those who have studied agricultural credit were noted.&#13;
Principally, the much discussed risks of the owners of small industries&#13;
defaulting on loans are often proving to be real. In fact, the default rates&#13;
are high enough in some programs to raise the most fundamental questions about&#13;
the economic desirability of the continuance of those programs as they are&#13;
presently designed.&#13;
Consessionary finance, for example, has been the general rule,&#13;
attracting - and for the most part going to - influential borrowers of good&#13;
standing. Since these borrowers are, in theory, low risk, it is hard to avoid&#13;
the conclusion that concessionary finance, with its attendant administrative&#13;
controls, invites loose banking practices and aggravates the risks. Hence the&#13;
commonplace argument for cost and risk-reflecting interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 64 -&#13;
While higher interest rates than now prevail would be desirable,&#13;
however, we have argued that this alone would not secure an efficient flow of&#13;
institutional finance to potentially low-risk borrowers currently denied&#13;
access to it. There are several reasons for this, which at the risk of&#13;
repetition we might state once more: -&#13;
(i)    Risk reflecting interest rates would be far&#13;
higher than is commonly supposed until the&#13;
financial instituions are fully adapted to&#13;
the task of lending to large numbers of&#13;
small borrowers. Even if they were&#13;
politically tolerable, which is unlikely to&#13;
be the case, they would probably extinguish&#13;
or greatly reduce the market.&#13;
(ii)   They would also impose an appreciable&#13;
external cost on potentially low risk&#13;
borrowers with sound and efficient&#13;
projects.&#13;
(iii)  An efficiently functioning financial system&#13;
requires the development of an accounting&#13;
base among the borrowers, both small and&#13;
large,legally acceptable documentaion of&#13;
assets held, legally developed procedures&#13;
for handling foreclosures and maintaining&#13;
repayment discipline, and developed&#13;
insurance markets. In each of these&#13;
respects, the deficiencies that exist in&#13;
developing countries are conspicuous, and&#13;
require a number of measures in addition to&#13;
a proper management of interest rate&#13;
policies.&#13;
(iv)   While there is evidence that the risks&#13;
decline if and as information and&#13;
experience are accumulated within the&#13;
institutions, this takes place over periods&#13;
that are not short,on account of (iii)&#13;
among other reaons. Thus assessments of&#13;
the profitability of lending to small&#13;
industry require long time horizons,&#13;
increasing the uncertainties further, and&#13;
leading to differing perspectives between&#13;
the public and private sectors as to the&#13;
desirability of starting a lending program.&#13;
(v)    There are reasons for believing that, when&#13;
risks arise appreciably, the objective&#13;
functions of the financial institutions are&#13;
different from that dictated by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 65 -&#13;
interests of economic efficiency;&#13;
specifically, there is evidence of risk-&#13;
avoidance.&#13;
As long as these problems remain significant the conclusion is&#13;
unavoidable that a transformation of the financial institutions policies will&#13;
nof take place - except over an exceedingly long period - without risk-&#13;
guarantee programs and the involvement of the public banks. It is&#13;
nevertheless clear that the financing programs would function better if they&#13;
were accompanied by a relaxation of administrative controls on interest rate&#13;
policies and the borrowings and lendings of financial intermediaries. Under&#13;
these circumstances the interest rates would rise to levels that would roughly&#13;
reflect the costs of raising resources and lending to low-risk borrowers.&#13;
This argument is not new. But it is strengthened, it is hoped, by the&#13;
evidence presented in the text and by reference to recent research on&#13;
uncertainty in economics.&#13;
The small industry programs themselves are also accompanied by&#13;
administrative controls in many countries, e.g. in terms of the types of firms&#13;
and assets to be financed. Ostensibly, they were intended to encourage the&#13;
intermediaries only to finance "job creating" projects, and have led to, among&#13;
other things, the much discussed neglect of working capital finance and to the&#13;
exclusion of firms seeking to raise output without necessarily expanding&#13;
employment. Again, we have argued that such controls both increase the risks&#13;
of the programs and reduce their capacity to improve employment&#13;
opportunties. For more detail, the reader must be referred back to the&#13;
discussion of the employment issue in Part III.&#13;
It is sometimes argued that if leading sector policies were more&#13;
appropriately chosen, direct interventions to assist small industries would&#13;
not be necessary. Under leading sector policies are included tariffs,&#13;
investment incentives and policies towards agriculture. As we argued in&#13;
Part III, however, this is a fundamentally wrong way of interpreting the&#13;
purposes of small industry programs. Properly considered, these programs are&#13;
not intended to be an alternative, but instead to address specific sources of&#13;
market failure (e.g. in the capital markets) and of inefficiency (e.g.&#13;
management or   X  inefficiency) that would limit the effectiveness of a&#13;
movement towards more desirable leading sector policies. Equally, it is true&#13;
that small industries would stand to gain from the long-standing proposals for&#13;
a reform of these policies -in particular from a more labor demanding&#13;
structure of industrial incentives and tariffs, and from a more broadly-based&#13;
growth of agiculture. For this reason it was concluded that the more&#13;
efficient (and also the more labor demanding) the leading sector policies, the&#13;
more efficient the small industry programs are likely to be. This conclusion&#13;
is, I believe, generally applicable.&#13;

            Small industry in developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper first examines the changing
            size distribution of industry in developing countries by
            region and over time, and, by reference to firm-level
            surveys, it discusses the underlying causes. The importance
            of markets generated by the growth of agriculture and rural
            incomes for the regional development of industry, both
            small- and large-scale, is noted. Second, it discusses the
            entrepreneurship issue, arguing that while small and large
            firms alike are highly responsive to the growth of markets,
            the measured entrepreneurial response is neither as full nor
            as efficient as is desirable. The third and last part
            discusses small industry programs and their relation to
            development policy. Financing and extension programs are
            considered in detail, and there is a discussion of the risks
            involved. Some parallels with agricultural credit are
            discussed. It is also argued that small industries would
            stand to benefit from more efficient policies towards
            agriculture and industry.
