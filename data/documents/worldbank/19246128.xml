Administration Arrangement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Arrangement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;

including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset&#13;

Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;

Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;

exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;

Arrangement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right&#13;
to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Arrangements of all Donors and which would thereafter be&#13;

Administration Arrangements or from new Donors under new Administration Arrangements.&#13;
