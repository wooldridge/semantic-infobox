FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development.     Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report.    The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning  programs.    They  include   several country and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis and research, and on reports of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.       The&#13;
papers   are   the  work   of   individuals   and  the   views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and  development   issues  among   students  and  practitioners   of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
The first of the two papers in this report describes and&#13;
provides representations of the patterns of rapid fertility and rapid&#13;
mortality decline in developing countries. Rapid mortality decline in&#13;
represented by a logistic equation for increase in life expectancy at&#13;
birth estimated from World Bank data for the 14 developing countries&#13;
with the most rapid declines between 1950 and 1980. Rapid fertility&#13;
decline, for 11 selected developing countries, is shown to be adequately&#13;
represented by a linear decline in the total fertility rate of about&#13;
0.22 points a year. This decline is assumed to end at replacement&#13;
level. Comparisons are made between projections incorporating rapid&#13;
declines and the World Bank standard projections. These comparisons&#13;
confirm the rapidity of the declines given by the models; demonstrate&#13;
that growth in developing countries into the next century will continue&#13;
to be substantial even with rapid fertility decline; and show that rapid&#13;
mortality decline increases growth much less than rapid fertility&#13;
decline reduces it.&#13;
The second of these two papers concerns the linkage between&#13;
fertility and mortality transition. Some effect of mortality decline on&#13;
fertility decline is widely posited, and behavioral evidence exists to&#13;
support particular linkages. Using World Bank data, an attempt is made&#13;
to link the timing of fertility transition to levels of life expectancy&#13;
at birth. Transition is defined to start in the year that total&#13;
fertility begins a five-year drop of at least 0.7 points. Most&#13;
countries that have started transition, by this criterion, had life&#13;
expectancies of at least 53 at the start, though they did not show&#13;
particularly rapid mortality declines. Apparent exceptions to a&#13;
threshold of 53 are considered, leading to the observations that social&#13;
disorganization must be ruled out before considering a fertility decline&#13;
as transitional; that Argentina and Uruguay are exceptional and follow&#13;
the divergent European pattern of fertility decline at lower life&#13;
expectancy levels; and that China and Indonesia were close to the&#13;
threshold, but whether or not they met it cannot be conclusively&#13;
determined. It is also demonstrated that attaining the mortality&#13;
threshold may be necessary but is not sufficient: many years after,&#13;
some countries had still not started fertility transition.&#13;
Acknowledgments&#13;
Some data for these papers were obtained from Kenneth Hill and&#13;
Nicholas Prescott. Bryan Boulier and Kenneth Hill both provided advice&#13;
and comments, and useful comments were also received from others. The&#13;
projections were run by Kathy Fleischer and Suleikha Patel, using a&#13;
package developed for the World Bank by Kenneth Hill. Lynna SyCip&#13;
assisted with the figures, and Banjonglak Duangrat prepared the document.&#13;

PATTERNS AND PROJECTIONS FOR RAPID FERTILITY AND MORTALITY DECLINE&#13;
Consensus among demographers would probably be possible on a few&#13;
developing countries that have achieved rapid fertility decline, as well as on&#13;
a few that have achieved rapid mortality decline. Consensus on a proper&#13;
definition for rapid decline in either demographic parameter is more elusive,&#13;
however. This paper attempts to provide some precise definitions. As&#13;
standards against which to assess the performance of specific countries, or as&#13;
descriptions of alternative, probably desirable future demographic paths,&#13;
definitions of rapid fertility and rapid mortality decline should have varied&#13;
uses.&#13;
Patterns of demographic change in developing countries will be&#13;
examined, relying heavily, though not exclusively, on World Bank data, and&#13;
attempts will be made to represent rapid decline patterns. Projections using&#13;
these representations of rapid decline will then be shown for major regions of&#13;
the developing world.&#13;
RAPID MORTALITY DECLINE&#13;
Mortality decline will be represented by changes in life expectancy&#13;
at birth. Decline might also be represented by changes in infant and child&#13;
mortality or in particular life table measures, like survival to age 10.&#13;
However, life expectancy for different countries and years is more readily&#13;
available from World Bank files, and constitutes a convenient single measure.&#13;
These steps will be followed in developing a pattern for rapid&#13;
mortality decline. First, an attempt will be made to develop a pattern for&#13;
standard mortality decline, essentially representing the recent collective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
experience of developing countries. Second, this standard will be used in&#13;
identifying countries, and particular periods for specific countries, with&#13;
rapid mortality decline. Third, a model that represents these rapid-decline&#13;
countries and periods will be estimated.&#13;
Representit)g standard mortality decline&#13;
A curve representing the time trend for life expectancy at birth (et,&#13;
where t stands for some calendar year) should be generally S-shaped, showing&#13;
an initial gradually accelerating improvement followed by an eventual&#13;
deceleration as high life expectancy levels are reached. Palloni observes&#13;
that the trend for France, England and Wales, and Sweden resembles a logistic&#13;
curve "with a rather flat curvature. By contrast, he finds the time trend&#13;
for several Latin American countries--Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Nicaragua,&#13;
and Mexico--also has a logistic shape, but with a sharper curvature, i.e., "a&#13;
steeper rise at the beginning and a somewhat less smooth flattening at the&#13;
end" (Palloni, 1981:628).&#13;
Another approach to determining the time trend in life expectancy has&#13;
been taken by the World Bank (Vu, 1983). Using estimates provided by the&#13;
United Nations, the changes in female life expectancies from 1965-69 to 1975-&#13;
79 were regressed on the initial 1965-69 life expectancies. This was done&#13;
separately for two groups of countries: those with a female primary school&#13;
enrollment percentage under 70 and those with such a percentage of 70 or&#13;
more. Developed countries were included in the second group. For the first&#13;
(low female education) group, the estimated equation was&#13;
et+10 - et = 1.7023 + .021254 et + .00080871 et2             (1)&#13;
with R2 = 0.09. Countries in this group had initial life expectancies between&#13;
37.5 and 53.0. For the second (high female education) group, the equation was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3-&#13;
et+10 - et = -10.324 + .62331 e - .0061859 e 2                (2)&#13;
t                ~~~~~t         t&#13;
with R2 = 0.55. Countries in this group had initial life expectancies between&#13;
40.5 and 77.0, though relatively few were below 50. Year-by-year increments&#13;
were obtained from these equations for projection purposes by dividing by&#13;
10. For intermediate and higher life expectancy levels, particularly beyond&#13;
60, (1) is inadequate and (2) recommended instead. If (2) is used for&#13;
projections, it should be noted that annual increments become negative as et&#13;
approaches 80.&#13;
To obtain a time path from these equations, a 130-year series for et&#13;
was generated using (1), until e approached 50, and then switching to (2). At&#13;
the point of switching, the two curves come quite close together. In this&#13;
series et rises from 36 to 79. Logistic curves of the form&#13;
et = k+                                                       (3)&#13;
1 + exp&#13;
were fit to this series, assuming an upper bound (k0+k) of 82.5 years. This&#13;
asymptote was selected to allow et to rise beyond presently observed levels,&#13;
although (2) does not indicate they will. Several lower asymptotes (k0)&#13;
between 0 and 30 were tried. The parameters for the most satisfactory&#13;
equation are given in the first line (numbered equation 4) of Table 1. The&#13;
value of a is arbitrary; it is set here (and in all subsequent equations) to&#13;
make et=30 when t=0.&#13;
This curve was compared to World Bank data for developing countries&#13;
for 1950-80. Although (1) and (2) were based on female life expectancies, (4)&#13;
was applied to combined male and female expectancies. (Appendix A discusses&#13;
estimating sex-specific life expectancies.) It comes close to predicting&#13;
decadal changes in life expectancy. Somewhat smaller change than actually took&#13;
place is predicted between 1950 and 1960, but about as much change as actually&#13;
occurred is predicted between 1960 and 1970 and between 1970 and 1980. Since&#13;

Note: Asymptotic standard errors are in parentheses.&#13;
(1) and (2) were estimated for the later period, this is to be expected. In&#13;
addition, however, (4) predicts slightly faster change at low life expectancy&#13;
levels than actually took place, and slightly slower change at high levels.&#13;
The mean differences are small, none of them being as large as their standard&#13;
errors. Nevertheless, an attempt at a closer approximation was made.&#13;
The procedure was this. Solving (3) for t gives an expression that&#13;
can be substituted back into an equation similar to (3) for et+c, to give&#13;
e    = kk (k0+k-e ) exp bc  + (k0+k) (et-ko)                 (5)&#13;
t+c        (k0+k-et) exp     + (et-k.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
The parameters ko, k, and b can be estimated from this equation. The&#13;
procedure used was the multivariate secant method (Ralston and Jennrich, 1979)&#13;
and the data were the same World Bank data for developing countries on life&#13;
expectancy for both sexes combined. The restriction was imposed that ko+k=80,&#13;
an upper bound slightly below that used earlier, which seems to fit the&#13;
data better.&#13;
Table 1 gives several estimates of the parameters. The first set of&#13;
estimates (6) comes from 1950s data, the others from 1960s and 1970s data&#13;
combined. For the first two sets of estimates, five-year changes in life&#13;
expectancy were used. That is, for (7), et was taken to be the life&#13;
expectancy for 1960, 1965, 1970, or 1975, and et+c the respective life&#13;
expectancy for 1965, 1970, 1975, or 1980. In this case, therefore, the total&#13;
number of observations was four times the number of countries. For the third&#13;
set of estimates (8), single-year changes in et between 1960 and 1980 were&#13;
used. In this case, each country provided 20 observations. For the last set&#13;
of estimates (9), five-year and one-year change data were combined, without&#13;
weighting.&#13;
The estimates for the 1950s diverge from the other estimates,&#13;
indicating a faster rise in expectation of life, even at relatively low&#13;
levels. The other three sets of estimates are all much closer together. The&#13;
smoothing procedures that have been applied to the World Bank data presumably&#13;
affect one-year changes more than five-year changes. Therefore the second set&#13;
of estimates (7), based on five-year changes between 1960 and 1980, was chosen&#13;
as probably more reliable. In contrast to (4), (7) has a higher lower bound,&#13;
implying slower initial growth in et, but a steeper slope thereafter.&#13;
The appropriateness of the logistic shape is indicated in Figure 1,&#13;
where five-year change in e is plotted against the initial level for each&#13;

because of the complications that would be introduced was not attempted&#13;
here. Other plots indicate that the residuals from the curve are slightly&#13;
greater, in the absolute, at low et levels, suggesting either greater&#13;
variability in performance at these levels or greater instability in mortality&#13;
estimates. The correlation between the absolute residuals and the starting et&#13;
was negative though small, indicating a minor problem that will be of further&#13;
concern below.&#13;
Comparisons of the predictions from (7) with the experience of&#13;
developing countries are provided in Tables 2 and 3. As expected, observed&#13;
decadal changes are greater than those predicted by (7) during the 1950s in&#13;
practically all groups, though the advantage is minimal for countries that&#13;
started with life expectancies of 60 or more. For the 1960s, observed gains&#13;
are slighter greater than predicted, and for the 1970s, slightly smaller.&#13;
Across regions (Table 3), decadal patterns are similar but not identical. All&#13;
regions outperformed the standard in the 1950s, but the Middle East and North&#13;
Africa had the smallest gain.   In the 1960s and 1970s, however, the Middle&#13;
East and North Africa gained more relative to the standard than any other&#13;
region.  The other regions showed minimal gains relative to the standard in&#13;
the 1960s, except for South Asia, which lost ground. In the 1970s, all&#13;
regions, except the Middle East and North Africa, failed to come up to the&#13;
standard.&#13;

Identifying rapid mortality decline&#13;
Countries with rapid mortality decline were selected with reference&#13;
to the standard given in (7). This was accomplished by solving (5) for b, a&#13;
parameter whose absolute value is proportional to the rapidity of change.&#13;
With the values of ko and k from (7), b could be estimated for any two&#13;
successive values of et separated by a specified number of years.&#13;
By this method, b was estimated for all developing countries from&#13;
life expectancies in 1950 and 1980. Table 4 lists, in order under Group A,&#13;
the 29 countries for which b was at least 0.01 smaller than the standard b of&#13;
-0.038895. This list is heavily weighted toward high-mortality countries,&#13;
because of the somewhat greater variability in performance at high mortality&#13;
levels. There is reason to be skeptical of observations at these levels: few&#13;
reliable data actually exist. Eight African countries in the rapid decline&#13;
group in fact have identical values of et for 1950, probably because&#13;
individual country data are not available.&#13;
Since, by 1981, only Afghanistan and Somalia still had expectations&#13;
of life below 40 (World Bank, 1983), mortality experience below this level is&#13;
of little current relevance. Therefore a second selection of countries was&#13;
made, excluding all observations of life expectancies of 40 or below. If the&#13;
et for 1950 for a given country exceeded 40, the same b, for 1950-80, was&#13;
taken as in the previous step. If not, b was estimated from the first&#13;
observation of et that exceeded 40 and the et for 1980. In this case, if et&#13;
did not exceed 40 up to 1970, the country was eliminated from consideration.&#13;
The rapid-decline countries selected by this procedure, a smaller group of 14&#13;
countries with b at least 0.01 smaller than the standard b, are also listed in&#13;
Table 4, under Group B.&#13;

To determine whether rapid decline was generally sustained in these&#13;
countries, or whether rapid decline alternated with slower decline, b was&#13;
calculated for successive five-year periods, and its value correlated across&#13;
pairs of successive periods, across pairs of periods separated by one&#13;
intervening period, across pairs of periods separated by two intervening&#13;
periods, and so on. Table 5 shows that values of b for successive periods are&#13;
highly positively correlated, values for two periods separated by one&#13;
intervening period essentially uncorrelated, and values for periods that are&#13;
further separated are all negatively correlated. The implication is that&#13;
periods of very rapid mortality decline, in which a country outperforms all&#13;
others, generally last at least 10 years but no more than 15 years, and are&#13;
succeeded by periods of slower decline, when a country falls behind other&#13;
leaders, though it may still have rapid change relative to the average for all&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
The fastest 15-year mortality declines achieved by the Group B&#13;
countries are given in Table 4. These declines are always considerably faster&#13;
than those for the entire 30-year period, which is consistent with the idea&#13;
that decline speeds up and slows down in 10-year to 15-year cycles.&#13;
Estimating a rapid-decline pattern&#13;
Three estimates of the parameters for a logistic equation&#13;
representing rapid decline, based on the experience of Group A and Group B&#13;
countries, aLre given in Table 6. Five-year changes in et were taken as the&#13;
basis for the estimates in each case, following the procedure described above&#13;
for estimating the standard decline pattern. For Group B, alternative&#13;
estimates are reported using only those portions of each country's experience&#13;
which represent its most rapid 15-year mortality decline.&#13;

equation, for Group B, shows a slightly faster rise in et than (10), for Group&#13;
A, though from a slightly higher minimum et level. Selecting the 15-year&#13;
periods with fastest declines produces an even steeper slope in (12). The&#13;

Group B results are preferable to those for Group A, because of the better&#13;
data. Between (11) and (12), the choice depends on what assumptions one&#13;
wishes to make. If the pattern of alternate speeding up and slowing down of&#13;
mortality decline is assumed to be normal and inevitable, (11) is the better&#13;
choice: although more rapid decline than that indicated by this equation may&#13;
be possible at certain periods, this must be balanced by slower decline later&#13;
on. If one assumes, on the other hand, that the slowing down of mortality&#13;
decline is not an intrinsic part of the pattern and can be avoided by careful&#13;
planning, then one might prefer (12). For current purposes, (11) will be&#13;
adopted.&#13;
Comparison with other data&#13;
Better series on life expectancy than the World Bank data are&#13;
unfortunately rare. From Hill's (1984) attempt to collect such information,&#13;
useful data could be extracted for only five, mainly small and&#13;
unrepresentative, developing countries or territories: Jamaica, Mauritius,&#13;
Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka, and Trinidad and Tobago. All these countries are&#13;
recognized as having had some success, in particular periods, in bringing down&#13;
mortality. However, only Trinidad and Tobago had sufficiently sustained rapid&#13;
decline over 30 years (in the World Bank series) to be included in Table 4.&#13;
For each of these countries, between two and five data points are&#13;
available from Hill for various years between 1950 and 1976. Between&#13;
successive points it is possible to calculate the speed of change in life&#13;
expectancy, as represented by the b parameter, assuming standard mortality&#13;
decline (7). This can then be compared with the b parameters for rapid-&#13;
decline countries in Table 4. The speed of change in these five countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
fell within the range represented in Table 4 in roughly half the cases, below&#13;
the range the rest of the time. In only one case was mortality change even&#13;
more rapid than for the countries and periods in Table 4. This was for Puerto&#13;
Rico between 1950 and 1955, a fairly short period; estimating change in Puerto&#13;
Rico over a longer period, such as 1950 to 1960, would bring the b coefficient&#13;
back within the range.&#13;
This comparison suggests that selecting rapid-decline periods from&#13;
the data for these five countries would lead to a rapid-decline model at least&#13;
roughly similar to that estimated from the Bank data. Figure 3 shows an&#13;
alternative comparison. Life expectancies for the five countries are plotted&#13;
against the estimated curves for standard decline (7) and rapid decline&#13;
(11). The horizontal axis is adjusted so that both estimated curves provide&#13;
life expectancies of 50 in year 0, and the years for each country are adjusted&#13;
so that the first data point in each case lies on the rapid-decline curve.&#13;
Although particular countries outperformed the rapid decline pattern at&#13;
points, generally in the 1950s, over the entire periods for which they have&#13;
data most of them performed less well. This is consistent with the fact that&#13;
only one of them was chosen as a rapid-decline country based on Bank data.&#13;
The relative rapidity of mortality decline in the 1950s, and the&#13;
pattern of alternate speeding up and slowing down of mortality decline, are at&#13;
least consistent with these meager data. The data also remind us that the&#13;
rapid mortality decline pattern represented here is not meant to be the&#13;
fastest on record, and could conceivably be exceeded by particular countries&#13;
in the short run.&#13;

RAPID FERTILITY DECLINE&#13;
Rapid fertility decline will be represented by changes in the total&#13;
fertility rate (TFR). Other fertility measures, like the crude birth rate and&#13;
the net reproduction rate, might be used instead; however, TFR has the&#13;
advantage of being sufficiently refined to exclude age structure while also&#13;
being widely available.&#13;
Describing the pattern of rapid decline in TFR involved these&#13;
steps: selecting developing countries where fertility fell rapidly; studying&#13;
the patterns in TFR over time in these countries; and representing these&#13;
patterns methematically.&#13;
Selection of countries&#13;
A decline over five years of at least 0.7 points in a country's TFR&#13;
is a good indicator of the start of fertility transition (as the following&#13;
paper shows). A steeper drop, of 1.0 points in five years, was taken to&#13;
indicate rapid fertility decline.&#13;
Applying this criterion to data in the World Bank files led to the&#13;
initial identification of 24 countries or territories that experienced such&#13;
declines betweeen 1950 and 1980. Two of these (Cape Verde and Kampuchea) were&#13;
excluded because the fertility decline was due to social disorganization&#13;
rather than fertility transition. Four others (the Dominican Republic,&#13;
Grenada, the Philippines, and American Samoa) were excluded because they&#13;
showed no TFRs below 4.5 up to 1980; only the early stages of transition could&#13;
be observed in these cases. No adequate data covering a sufficiently long&#13;
period--other than the World Bank data--could be found for seven others:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Guadeloupe, Guam, Guyana, Jamaica, Lebanon, Malaysia (where the incorporation&#13;
of Sabah and Sarawak disrupted the series), and Martinique. Although the&#13;
World Bank data were used in initially identifying countries, the smoothing&#13;
and interpolation procedures applied to these data, as well as the&#13;
availability of other sources, argued against exclusive reliance on them.&#13;
The remaining 11 countries or territories were China, Colombia, Costa&#13;
Rica, Cuba, Hong Kong, Mauritius, Reunion, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and&#13;
Trinidad. TFRs for these countries for different years were drawn from&#13;
several sources, including reports of the Committee on Population and&#13;
Demography of the National Academy of Sciences and a U.S. Census Bureau (1979)&#13;
report which summarizes national fertility rates from different publications&#13;
(see Appendix B for rates and sources). The TFR estimates drawn from these&#13;
sources are generally year-by-year estimates covering as few as 10 years or as&#13;
many as 20 years; for a few countries there are gaps in the series. For&#13;
comparison, South Korea and Chile, two countries with slightly slower&#13;
fertility declines (their greatest five-year TFR declines exceed 0.7 but do&#13;
not reach 1.0) will also be considered.&#13;
Trends in total fertility&#13;
Figure 4 shows the trends in TFR in each country or territory. The&#13;
plots have been shifted horizontally so that the lines are as nearly coincident&#13;
as possible. (How this was done is discussed below.) Except for a few points&#13;
at the begirning of some series (before fertility decline starts) and a few&#13;
points at the end (when fertility ceases to decline and may even rise temporarily)&#13;
the trends In TFR are roughly linear in each country. The Colombia data had&#13;
been smoothed, and some smoothing of the other data cannot be excluded.&#13;

Where the series go back far enough, predecline TFR levels are shown to&#13;
vary. They were as low as 5.1 to 5.2 in Chile, but as high as 7.5 in China (a&#13;
peak reflecting a rebound from low points reached during the Great Leap&#13;
Forward and its aftermath). Relatively low predecline levels are shown for&#13;
South Korea (5.3 to 6.0) and Mauritius (5.9 to 6.2), relatively high levels&#13;
for Reunion (6.2 to 6.8) and Thailand (6.2 to 6.9). An even greater spread in&#13;
predecline levels may be observed among countries that have not started&#13;
fertility transition. For instance, Gabon--where fertility transition has&#13;
clearly not started--has a TFR that varies between 4.1 and 4.5. No attempt&#13;
will be made to represent these predecline levels by any kind of average;&#13;
instead, a uniform path will be described along which fertility falls,&#13;
regardless of the point from which it starts.&#13;
Stalls after fertility decline has begun require more careful&#13;
identification. Define a stall by a rule of three: at least three years of&#13;
constant or rising TFR or a total rise in TFR of at least 0.3 points. Then&#13;
about half of these countries show a stall. Smaller reversals in the downward&#13;
trend in TFR do occur in these series, but they almost all involve rises of&#13;
0.1 or less and interfere with the trend for only one year, and thus are&#13;
substantially shorter and slighter than regular stalls. The most notable such&#13;
ministall is that for Korea. After dropping steeply from 4.6 to 4.3 in one&#13;
year, TFR holds at 4.4 for two years before at least another decade of&#13;
declines. This partly explains why the decline in Korea appears relatively&#13;
slow. Other ministalls may of course be nothing more than estimation errors.&#13;
The regular stalls defined by the rule of three start generally&#13;
around 15 years, but in one case as few as 10 years, after the start of&#13;
fertility decline. TFR at the point at which the stall starts varies from 3.7&#13;
in Costa Rica down to 2.5 in China. The other three cases with stalls are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Trinidad and Tobago (3.4), Mauritius (3.0), and Taiwan (2.7). From this low&#13;
point, fertility may rise immediately or stay constant for a while, but the&#13;
eventual rebound is always at least 0.3 and as much as 0.5 points. All but&#13;
one of these stalls take place near the end of the data series for that&#13;
country. Only Trinidad and Tobago has data to show renewed decline, at a&#13;
slightly slower pace, after a stall.&#13;
The reasons for stalls in fertility decline are believed to vary from&#13;
case to case (Gendell, 1984). In China, an increase in marriages following&#13;
relaxation of marriage controls may have been responsible. In Taiwan, the&#13;
preference for sons is often cited as a key reason. Another instance of&#13;
stalled decline, in Sri Lanka, has been partly attributed to failures in&#13;
delivering contraceptive and abortive services and partly to increased&#13;
marriages. One broad hypothesis that is consistent with the variety of&#13;
explanations for different countries is that stalled fertility decline results&#13;
from the playing out of the initial impulse that generated the decline,&#13;
whether this was a family planning program, particular socioeconomic changes,&#13;
or some combination of factors. This impulse is gradually overwhelmed by&#13;
diverse other forces that are held in check while the decline is more&#13;
vigorous.&#13;
For present purposes, there are too few data from which to model a&#13;
stall and the eventual resumption of fertility decline. Instead of attempting&#13;
to do this, it will be assumed that a decline progresses unhampered, as would&#13;
presumably be the case if a country were able to continually rejuvenate the&#13;
programs and social forces that produce a decline. When more data are&#13;
available, it might be desirable to build a stall into the model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Regressions by country&#13;
To determine the pace of decline in each country, the points at the&#13;
beginning prior to decline and at the end after decline stalled were&#13;
eliminated, and linear regressions of TFR on time run in each country. R2 for&#13;
these regressions was 0.95 or above, except for Reunion, where it was 0.89.&#13;
Table 7 gives the slopes from these regressions and the number of&#13;
years it would take for TFR to drop by 1.0 points at each rate. Mauritius&#13;
shows the fastest decline: TFR falls by 1.0 points every three years.&#13;
Reunion and China are not far behind. The median is roughly four years for a&#13;
fall in TFR of 1.0 points. Chile and South Korea clearly had slower-paced&#13;
declines than the other countries; they needed more than six years on average&#13;
for TFR to fall by 1.0 points.&#13;
Including a quadratic term in the equations generally does not&#13;
improve the fit. The quadratic term is significant only in Reunion, where a&#13;
more gradual decline at the outset may be noted.&#13;
Regressions across countries&#13;
The data for all countries (excluding Chile and South Korea) were&#13;
pooled. To accomplish this, it was first assumed that the average country in&#13;
this group started in year 0 with a TFR of 7.5, and that TFR dropped by 0.25&#13;
points (the median decline in the country regressions) every year&#13;
thereafter. TFR at the midpoint of the data series for each country was&#13;
located on this average line, and the dates for this and all the other points&#13;
in the series adjusted accordingly.&#13;

Regressions were then run to predict TFR from year, ignoring points&#13;
prior to the decline as well as points representing stalls in decline. The&#13;
linear and quadratic equations, and an equation using natural logs, were:&#13;
TFR = 7.164  - .2164 year,    R2 = 0.94                   (13)&#13;
(0.564)  (.0041)&#13;
TFR = 7.224  - .2284 year   + .0004789 yea2,    R2 = 0.94&#13;
(0.101)  (.0173)        (.0006737)&#13;
TFR = 8.550  - 1.7171 ln (year),    R2 = 0.78&#13;
(0.1727) (0.0704)&#13;
Standard errors are given in parentheses beneath each equation.   The quadratic&#13;
term is not significant. The simple linear representation appears&#13;
appropriate. In this model, it takes 4.6 years for TFR to fall by one point,&#13;
or 17 years for a transition from a TFR of 6.0 to a TFR of 2.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

The end of fertility decline&#13;
If total fertility is not to hit zero and fall below it, transitional&#13;
decline has to be halted or become much more gradual at some point. An&#13;
appropriate stopping point is difficult to select. Some countries show&#13;
fertility rates falling below replacement level. In this sample, Cuba falls&#13;
to 1.6 and Singapore to 1.9, and neither shows any tendency to stop&#13;
declining. Others show decline ending, and rates holding constant for long&#13;
periods, above replacement: in Uruguay, for instance, total fertility stayed&#13;
between 2.7 and 3.0 between 1950 and 1980. Subsequent fluctuations after&#13;
transitional decline has stopped cannot be excluded, but cannot be predicted&#13;
either within the scope of this exercise.&#13;
As a provisional solution, it will be assumed that transitional&#13;
decline stops exactly at the replacement level, and stays at that level&#13;
thereafter. It is unlikely that this will happen in any given country, but in&#13;
the long run, and in the aggregate, the replacement level permits continued&#13;
societal survival given finite resources, and therefore has intuitive appeal.&#13;
Replacement requires a TFR of about 2.3 when female expectation of life at&#13;
birth is 65, slightly above the 1980 level for upper middle income&#13;
countries. Since expectation of life can be expected to rise beyond 65, a&#13;
further, much slower decline in TFR should be built into the model.&#13;
The TFR required to provide replacement can be determined for a&#13;
stable population under certain assumptions. Given a sex ratio at birth of&#13;
1.05, a mean age at childbearing of 28, and a Coale-Demeny West mortality&#13;
pattern, replacement TFR is closely approximated by the equation:&#13;
TFR = 7.0231 - .11967 eF + .00072143 (eF)2                  (14)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
where eF stands for female life expectancy. The equation holds at least&#13;
between eF levels of 65 and 77.5; when eF reaches 83, increments to TFR become&#13;
positive by this equation. Replacement TFRs from this equation can be assumed to&#13;
supersede those calculated from (13) as soon as they exceed them, More complex&#13;
procedures that take into account differences in mean age at childbearing, the&#13;
sex ratio, and similar factors are also possible, but will not be discussed&#13;
here.&#13;
It was earlier noted that countries may join the rapid fertility&#13;
decline line at different points. Presumably they may also exit from it at&#13;
different points, rather than at the replacement level represented here.&#13;
A logistic alternative&#13;
A possible alternative to a linear model to replacement is a&#13;
declining logistic curve, represented, for instance, by (3) above, with b&#13;
being positive. Assuming that k (the distance TFR falls from its initial&#13;
maximum) and ko (the lowest level it reaches) are fixed a priori at k* and ko&#13;
respectively, the logistic equation can be rewritten as&#13;
In (     k*       1) = a + bt&#13;
TFR -k&#13;
The parameters a and b were estimated from the cross-national data using this&#13;
equation (again leaving out points prior to and subsequent to the major&#13;
fertility decline), with k0* = 2.06 (the replacement value corresponding to a&#13;
female life expectancy of about 82) and k* = 5.44 (to allow TFR to start at a&#13;
maximum of 7.5). R2 for the linear equation was 0.91. The alternative&#13;
logistic model is, therefore:&#13;
TFR = 2.06 +              5.44                            (15)&#13;
ex-2.4480 + .22061 (year)             (5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
This model has both advantages and disadvantages. Unlike the linear&#13;
model to replacement, it allows a more gradual start and a more gradual end to&#13;
the fertility transition. However, there is no evidence in these series of a&#13;
gradual start (except for Reunion) or of a gradual end (apart from stalls,&#13;
which involve temporary rises in TFR that neither model captures). Further-&#13;
more, comparison of (15) with (13) shows that (15) implies slighter slower&#13;
decline early in the transition and slightly faster decline later. There is&#13;
no evidence to support such a pattern. Within-country regressions almost all&#13;
show linear slopes. The logistic model also implies slower decline when a&#13;
country starts its transition at a lower fertility level. Again, the limited&#13;
evidence for the few countries considered here does not support this: across&#13;
countries slopes are not related to the starting TFR. These differences&#13;
between (15) and (13) are small, however, and it is also possible that some of&#13;
the fertility series used here have been previously smoothed, and therefore&#13;
necessarily favor the linear model. In any case, the logistic curve, although&#13;
presented here as an alternative, has no clear advantages over the simpler&#13;
linear model to replacement, which will therefore be used to represent rapid&#13;
decline.&#13;
Linkage with mortality decline&#13;
This pattern for fertility has been defined independently of the&#13;
pattern for rapid mortality decline. It may be argued, however, that one&#13;
depends on the other. the following paper does make this argument, though in&#13;
a particular restricted form. The question may be asked, therefore, whether&#13;
the rapid fertility declines represented in Figure 4 were in fact linked to&#13;
similar rapid mortality declines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Of the 22 countries which show rapid fertility decline by the&#13;
criterion used here (including those not included in the analysis because of&#13;
limited data or little transition), five also appear on the list of 14 rapid&#13;
mortality decline countries (Group B). The overlap is only modest.&#13;
The speed of mortality decline in the periods covered by the&#13;
fertility transition data may be examined. Using the World Bank mortality&#13;
data and assuming a logistic increase in life expectancy as defined by (7),&#13;
the parameter b was calculated for change in life expectancy over the&#13;
fertility transition period.   In order, from the most rapid to the least rapid&#13;
mortality declines, the results were:&#13;
China          -.143                Taiwan         -.044&#13;
Costa Rica     -.055                Reunion        -.044&#13;
Hong Kong      -.048                Singapore      -.039&#13;
Cuba           -.047                Colombia       -.039&#13;
Trinidad                            Thailand       -.037&#13;
and Tobago   -.046                Mauritius      -.023&#13;
Considerable range in the speed of mortality decline is evident. China&#13;
performed exceptionally well, its decline in the specific period exceeding&#13;
that of the rapid mortality decline countries in Table 4. Mauritius, on the&#13;
other hand, had little change in life expectancies, the coefficient falling&#13;
well below that in the standard mortality decline pattern (7). The speed of&#13;
decline in all the other countries fell within the range specified by the&#13;
standard mortality decline (7) and rapid mortality decline (11) patterns.&#13;
Rapid fertility decline therefore appears consistent with either&#13;
rapid or standard mortality decline, though probably not, except in rare&#13;
cases, with substandard mortality decline. The following paper argues that&#13;
the speed of mortality decline may be less important for fertility transition&#13;
than initial mortality levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

PROJECTIONS UNDER RAPID DECLINE&#13;
The rapid fertility and rapid mortality decline patterns are not&#13;
meant to represent the speediest declines recorded. Instead, each represents&#13;
the collective experience of about a dozen countries with exceptional&#13;
demographic change. Desirable as such declines may be, they may or may not be&#13;
possible for other countries, or even for the same countries in the future.&#13;
The possibility of such declines and the cost of achieving them will not be&#13;
investigated here. What is of interest, instead, is what such declines would&#13;
imply for populations in the developing world.&#13;
The rapid decline patterns will be applied to individual developing&#13;
countries, and some demographic consequences up to the year 2100 reported for&#13;
the five major developing regions: sub-Saharan Africa, stretching from&#13;
Mauritania and the Sudan to South Africa; the Middle East and North Africa,&#13;
covering, among other countries, Iran, Israel, Turkey, and Cyprus; South Asia,&#13;
from Afghanistan to Burma; East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific, excluding&#13;
Japan, Australia, and New Zealand; and Latin America and the Caribbean,&#13;
including such territories as Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, and Martinique.&#13;
Comparisons will be made with World Bank projections for the same regions,&#13;
which will be referred to here as the standard projections (Vu, 1983; Demeny,&#13;
1984).&#13;
Separate comparisons will also be made between rapid fertility&#13;
decline and the demographic goals officially adopted by some governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Procedure&#13;
The Bank's standard projections use a modified cohort-component&#13;
method to simulate the future demographic effects of various fertility,&#13;
mortality, aLnd migration assumptions. Births in each successive five-year&#13;
period are calculated by applying a schedule of age-specific fertility rates,&#13;
scaled to agree with the given total fertility rate, to the female population&#13;
for the period. These births enter the population as the youngest cohort; the&#13;
size of each cohort as it ages then depends on assumed mortality conditions.&#13;
The future path for fertility is based on the experience of those&#13;
countries for which judgments regarding the future year of reaching&#13;
replacement fertility could be made with some confidence. The assumed year of&#13;
reaching replacement in these cases was regressed on several predictors:&#13;
current total fertility rate; the change in this rate over the previous ten&#13;
years; proportion of couples using contraception; and female life expectancy&#13;
at birth. The estimated equation was used to assign each country a&#13;
replacement year, constrained to fall between 2000 and 2050. Curves were then&#13;
fitted for the course of fertility up to the replacement year, chosen to&#13;
provide early accelerating decline (in some cases after a few years of&#13;
constant fertility), followed by decelerating decline as replacement is&#13;
reached. In most cases, fertility is then assumed to remain at replacement.&#13;
The future path for mortality is based on expected increments in&#13;
female life expectancy, which depend on the level of life expectancy already&#13;
reached (equations (1) and (2) above). Migration assumptions were entered in&#13;
the form of number of net migrants, by age and sex, in each five-year period;&#13;
the age distribution of migrants was obtained from a model based on their&#13;
overall sex ratio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
The rapid decline projections used the same methodology and the same&#13;
computer program as the standard projections, varying only the fertility and&#13;
mortality assumptions. Migration assumptions were identical to those in the&#13;
standard projections. Separate projections were prepared assuming (a) rapid&#13;
fertility decline only, with mortality decline following the pattern of the&#13;
standard projection; (b) rapid mortality decline only, with fertility&#13;
following the standard pattern; and (c) both rapid fertility and rapid&#13;
mortality decline. The program handles replacement directly, calculating the&#13;
necessary TFR to give a net reproduction rate of 1.0. This option was used in&#13;
place of the procedure for estimating replacement TFR outlined above.&#13;
Each of the projections was run country by country, with very small&#13;
countries and territories in each region usually aggregated into a single&#13;
artificial country, and totals and averages by region calculated as necessary.&#13;
Fertility and mortality assumptions&#13;
Figure 5 compares the total fertility rates assumed in the standard&#13;
projection and in the rapid fertility decline projection. (Table 8 provides&#13;
specific numbers for some years.) The standard projection assumes monotonic&#13;
decline in fertility in three regions: the Middle East and North Africa,&#13;
South Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. For sub-Saharan Africa, an&#13;
initial slight increase in fertility is assumed, with no regionwide fall until&#13;
1995. Once it begins, however, fertility decline is assumed to be quite&#13;
rapid; around 2010, TFR in sub-Saharan Africa is falling by 0.17 points a&#13;
year, as contrasted with a constant 0.22 points a year (until individual&#13;
countries begin to reach replacement) in the rapid fertility decline&#13;
projection. For East and Southeast Asia, fertility is lower than in any other&#13;

region because of low rates in China. Chinese fertility is assumed to dip&#13;
below replacement, and then to rise toward it.&#13;
The rapid decline patterns diverge in assuming earlier and steeper&#13;
declines in every region, except in East and Southeast Asia. (Because below-&#13;
replacement fertility, as in the China projection, is not allowed in the rapid&#13;
decline model, fertility for East and Southeast Asia is actually higher in the&#13;
standard projection than in the rapid fertility decline projection until&#13;
1995.) In every region, substantial declines ending close to replacement&#13;
levels all take place within 25 years, and subsequent declines are all much&#13;
more gradual. Thus the rapid fertility decline projection for sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, for instance, differs from the standard projection--and is very likely&#13;
less realistic--in not allowing a pause before decline begins. Differences&#13;
like this in timing of decline are probably as critical as the speed of&#13;
decline. Fertility differences between regions largely disappear--TFRs are&#13;
equal, to one decimal place--by 2040 in the rapid decline projection; in the&#13;
standard projection, they disappear five years later.&#13;
Figure 6 provides similar comparisons for mortality decline. All the&#13;
curves are smooth in this case; no special adjustments have been made. For&#13;
each region, the rapid mortality decline projection assumes a faster rise in&#13;
life expectancy than the standard projection.   Life expectancy rises as much&#13;
as seven years in some decades under rapid mortality decline, but never as&#13;
much as five years a decade in the standard projection. By 2000, life&#13;
expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa would be 59 under the standard projection, 64&#13;
under the rapid mortality decline projection. In South Asia, life expectancy&#13;
by 2000 would be either 61 or 67.&#13;
In the standard projection, life expectancies of 75, typical of&#13;
industrial market economies today, are reached as early as 2025 (in Latin&#13;

America and the Caribbean) or as late as 2065 (in South Asia). In the rapid&#13;
fertility decline projection, this level is reached between 2005 and 2030.&#13;
The regions maintain their relative positions throughout in the rapid&#13;
mortality decline projection, and by about 2090 regional differences&#13;
disappear: life expectancies are equal at 80. In the standard projection,&#13;
some reversals of position among the regions appear over time, and differences&#13;
persist well beyond the projection period.&#13;
Population growth&#13;
The implications for population size of the alternative projections&#13;
are shown in Figure 7 (see also Table 8). China has been separated from the&#13;
rest of East and Southeast Asia in this figure.&#13;
From 3,298 million in 1980, the population of all the current&#13;
developing countries as a whole would increase 255 percent to 8,400 million in&#13;
2050 in the standard projection, and 113 percent from that date to 2100,&#13;
reaching 9,464 million. In the rapid fertility decline projection, the&#13;
increases are not as large though still substantial, to 6,636 million in 2050&#13;
and 7,020 million in 2100. Given rapid fertility decline instead of the&#13;
standard projection, the developing-world population would therefore be only&#13;
79 percent of what it would otherwise be in 2050, and only 74 percent in&#13;
2100. Rapid mortality decline would mean slightly faster growth, but not much&#13;
faster: by 2050, the developing world population would instead be 107 percent&#13;
of the standard projection, and, by 2100, 106 percent of the standard. With&#13;
both rapid fertility and rapid mortality decline assumed, population size is&#13;
slightly above that when only rapid fertility decline is assumed (105 percent&#13;
in 2050, 103 percent in 2100).&#13;

Figure 7 shows that these patterns are consistent across regions:&#13;
rapid ferti'Lity decline means substantially slower growth; rapid mortality&#13;
decline means only slightly faster growth; and rapid mortality decline has a&#13;
marginally smaller effect when fertility declines rapidly than when it does&#13;
not. The magnitude of the effect of rapid declines does vary across regions,&#13;
however. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected: rapid fertility decline&#13;
means a population about 50 percent smaller than the standard projection by&#13;
2050, and rapid mortality decline a population about 10 percent larger. For&#13;
Latin America and the Caribbean and for East and Southeast Asia (excluding&#13;
China), on the other hand, rapid fertility decline implies a 15 percent&#13;
smaller population by 2050, rapid mortality decline a 3 percent larger&#13;
population.&#13;
Growth rate comparisons are instructive. In the standard projection,&#13;
the developlng world as a whole has its growth rate fall to 2.0 percent around&#13;
1990, to 1.0 percent around 2030, and to 0.1 percent around 2085. In the&#13;
rapid fertiLity decline projection, these growth rates are attained&#13;
increasingly earlier: 2.0 percent a little after 1985, 1.0 percent around&#13;
2015, and 0.1 percent around 2065. East and Southeast Asia attain these&#13;
growth rates in roughly the same period as the developing world as a whole.&#13;
For the Middile East and North Africa, there is some delay, and for sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, the delay is considerable--growth is above 2.0 percent up to 2025 in the&#13;
standard decline projection, almost up to 2000 in the rapid decline projection.&#13;
One consequence of these regional differences is a changing share of&#13;
the population in sub-Saharan Africa. In the standard projection, this region&#13;
has 12 percent of the developing-world population in 1980, 24 percent in 2050,&#13;
and 26 percent in 2100. In the rapid fertility decline projection, the&#13;
increase is much smaller, to 16 percent in both 2050 and 2100. In both&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
projections, the share of every other region (excluding China) in the&#13;
developing world population varies over time by no more than 2 percentage&#13;
points.&#13;
The effect of rapid fertility decline is cumulative. For each&#13;
region, as the projection period lengthens, the rapid fertility decline&#13;
population becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of the standard&#13;
projection. This trend is most marked in the first 50 years or so of the&#13;
projection period. Rapid mortality decline similarly means that the projected&#13;
population increasingly diverges from the standard, until maximum divergence&#13;
is reached after roughly 90 years.&#13;
Figure 8 shows the standard and rapid fertility decline projections&#13;
for the nine largest developing countries, after China. These countries are&#13;
projected to take varying periods to reach replacement: for instance,&#13;
Bangladesh takes 55 years in the standard projection, 18 years under rapid&#13;
fertility decline; Thailand takes 30 years in the standard projection, 6 under&#13;
rapid decline.&#13;
The only sub-Saharan country included, Nigeria, shows the fastest&#13;
projected population increase. In the standard projection, population by 2050&#13;
is five-and-one-half times the 1980 population, moving Nigeria from sixth to&#13;
third in size in the developing world, behind India and China. Bangladesh and&#13;
Pakistan are not far behind: population would quadruple in Bangladesh, almost&#13;
quadruple in Pakistan. Rapid fertility decline would have greater effect (or,&#13;
alternatively, standard decline would produce less change) in these three&#13;
countries than in the others. With rapid fertility decline, population in&#13;
Nigeria in 2050 would be 52 percent of what it would be in the standard&#13;
projection, in Bangladesh and Pakistan about 60 percent. Population in the&#13;
other countries would fall to between 81 and 87 percent of the standard.&#13;

Note may be made, finally, of the effects of rapid decline on the&#13;
dependency burden. The burden is greatest, among these nine countries, in&#13;
Nigeria, where the 1980 dependency ratio is 99. The ratio reaches 104 by 1995&#13;
in the standard projection. Given rapid fertility decline, the ratio would be&#13;
much lower at 86. For 2010, the contrast is between a dependency ratio of 90,&#13;
in the standard projection, and 50, in the rapid fertility decline&#13;
projection. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, the effect of rapid fertility decline&#13;
on the dependency ratio is less extreme, but still large. For most of the&#13;
other countries, dependency ratios are over ten points lower by 2000 under&#13;
rapid fertility decline than in the standard projection. Around 2030, in most&#13;
cases, the rapid fertility decline projection begins to give higher dependency&#13;
ratios than the standard projection.&#13;
Demographic goals&#13;
Data assembled by Prescott (1984; World Bank, 1984) on official&#13;
demographic targets can be compared with projected fertility rates. Eight&#13;
developing countries have targets expressed as particular crude birth rates to&#13;
be attained some time between 1986 and 2001; four others have targets&#13;
expressed as total fertility rates (Indonesia has both). For four more&#13;
countries, Prescott estimated total fertility rates from targets expressed in&#13;
different terms: Bangladesh and Jamaica want to reach a net reproduction rate&#13;
of 1 in 2000, Ghana seeks a growth rate of 2.0 percent by 2000, and Uganda a&#13;
growth rate of 2.6 percent by 1995.&#13;
In every case, the targets require lower fertility by some future&#13;
date than the standard projections would give, even though the standard&#13;
projections effectively assume that countries will make appropriate efforts in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

family planning. In most cases, the targets also require at least as much if&#13;
not more decline than the rapid fertility decline projections. The targeted&#13;
decline, from 1982 to the target year, may be expressed as a percentage of the&#13;
expected decline in the rapid decline model (Table 9). This percentage is&#13;
greater than 100 for eight countries, equal to 100 for five, and less than 100&#13;
for only three countries. Mexico and Thailand, which have experienced very&#13;
rapid diffusion of contraception, have particularly amibitious targets, 180&#13;
percent and 167 percent respectively of the declines expected in the rapid&#13;
decline model. Pakistan, with much less success to date, is almost as&#13;
ambitious at 150 percent. Uganda and Tunisia, at the other extreme, have&#13;
targeted only 74 and 86 percent, respectively, of what rapid fertility decline&#13;
would produce--probably wisely, in the case of Uganda.&#13;
A final comparison may be made for China, which has targeted a&#13;
population of 1.2 billion by 2000. This is equal to the standard projection,&#13;
which gives 1.196 billion by this date, and virtually equal to the rapid&#13;
fertility decline projection, which gives 1.266 billion.&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
Rapid mortality decline has been given quantitative representation,&#13;
in this paper, by selecting 14 developing countries that showed exceptionally&#13;
sharp declines between 1950 and 1980 and estimating a logistic equation (11)&#13;
to represent changes in life expectancy in these countries. Rapid fertility&#13;
decline has been represented, similarly, by selecting 11 countries with sharp&#13;
drops in fertility and estimating a linear equation (13) for the total&#13;
fertility rate. In this representation, it is assumed that rapid fertility&#13;
decline can start at any level and will continue until replacement level is&#13;
reached.&#13;

Projections were run using total fertility rates and life&#13;
expectancies estimated from these rapid decline models. In comparison with&#13;
World Bank projections, these projections clearly show accelerated changes in&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
fertility and mortality. This provides some support for labeling these&#13;
representations of fertility and mortality decline as rapid, and also&#13;
demonstrates that World Bank projections involve intermediate rather than&#13;
extreme assumptions.&#13;
Since the rapid fertility decline model does not allow below-&#13;
replacement fertility, however, the projections for China are inconsistent.&#13;
The World Bank projection, which assumes that Chinese fertility will stay&#13;
below replacement for a while, show lower fertility rates, for a period, than&#13;
the rapid fertility decline projection. This points to a problem with the&#13;
rapid fertility decline model, one that also applies to the World Bank&#13;
projections for other countries and is not easy to resolve. The assumption&#13;
that fertility will eventually settle and stay constant at replacement level&#13;
does not seem supported by the experience of developed countries (Demeny,&#13;
1984), nor by the experience of some developing countries where fertility has&#13;
fallen even further. However, fertility fluctuations close to replacement can&#13;
only be modeled with some knowledge of short-term economic and social trends,&#13;
and such knowledge is obviously unavailable.&#13;
In the rapid fertility decline projections, decline is assumed to&#13;
start immediately. The appropriateness of this assumption may be questioned,&#13;
especially for sub-Saharan Africa. The rapid decline model indicates how&#13;
total fertility will decline, but not when it will. The following paper makes&#13;
some observations about this question.&#13;
With rapid fertility decline, the developing-world population would&#13;
double, from 3.3 to 6.6 billion, between 1980 and 2050. In the World Bank&#13;
projections, however, the increase would be greater, to 8.4 billion in 2050.&#13;
Rapid fertility decline would make a large difference, but would not prevent&#13;
considerable growth. Rapid mortality decline would increase growth, but its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
effect would be small by comparison, and would be even smaller given&#13;
simultaneous rapid fertility decline. Barring catastrophe or significant&#13;
innovations in fertility control that go well beyond any current experience,&#13;
much larger developing-world populations appear inevitable.&#13;
Half of the developing countries with numerical demographic goals in&#13;
fact seek faster declines that those represented by the rapid fertility&#13;
decline model. Such extremely rapid declines appear unlikely from past&#13;
experience, but the fact that such goals have been chosen testifies to&#13;
government perceptions that expected population growth poses considerable&#13;
problems.&#13;

APPENDIX A&#13;
Estimating male and female life expectancies&#13;
For some projection purposes, female or male expectations of life&#13;
rather than total (male and female combined) expectations of life are more&#13;
convenient. The Coale-Demeny life tables, which provide matched tables for&#13;
men and women, can be used to obtain sex-specific expectations of life. To&#13;
avoid having to refer to the tables continually, the patterns can be reduced&#13;
to formulas. It will be assumed that West model life tables apply, and beyond&#13;
female life expectancies of 62.5 this assumption is adequate. (Taking North&#13;
model life tables instead would produce similar results.) In the West model&#13;
life tables, the difference between female and male life expectancy increases&#13;
from 2.71 years to 3.97 years between levels 9 and 21, and then decreases to&#13;
3.35 years by level 25. These changes are roughly linear, except for one&#13;
unusual, and probably inaccurate, dip in the female-male difference between&#13;
levels 12 and 13. With the assumption of a sex ratio at birth of 1.05, the&#13;
relation between female and total life expectancies was determined through&#13;
linear regression to be&#13;
eF = .4704 + 1.023 eT&#13;
when eT is under 68, and&#13;
eF = 4.191 + .9688 eT&#13;
when eT is 68 or more. Male life expectancies, if desired, are then simply&#13;
M   2.05 e  - e&#13;
1.05&#13;
If actual differences between male and female life expectancies at the initial&#13;
year should be taken into account, a slightly different procedure may be&#13;
used. Assume first that, whatever the initial gap between eF and eM, this gap&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
gradually converges to that specified by the equations above. It is&#13;
convenient to specify that the gap is exactly equal to that specified by these&#13;
equations when eT reaches 68, assuming it is initially below that, or 79,&#13;
assuming it is initially 68 or above. It is convenient also to assume that&#13;
the gap chainges linearly until eT reaches either 68 or 79. At this point the&#13;
gap should equal either 4 years (for 68) or 3.3702 years (for 79), and after&#13;
this it should simply follow the path specified by the second equation. From&#13;
these assumptions, one can estimate paths for eF and eM by estimating the year&#13;
in which el will reach 68 or 79, estimating the necessary annual changes in&#13;
the gap, and calculating the resultant sex-specific life expectancies. Note&#13;
that, if eMI is substantially above eF and eT is just under 68 or 79--a&#13;
combination of circumstances that is quite unlikely--it is possible by these&#13;
procedure to have eM falling just before eT reaches 68 or 79.&#13;

MORTALITY THRESHOLDS FOR FERTILITY TRANSITION&#13;
In the classic view of the demographic transition, a decline in&#13;
mortality in a given country in the course of development is eventually&#13;
matched by a later decline in fertility, until a rough balance is reached&#13;
around the replacement level. It is sometimes inferred from this assumed&#13;
association that mortality decline has some causal influence on fertility&#13;
decline.&#13;
This paper briefly reviews the evidence for such an association,&#13;
which includes microlevel studies of the mechanisms by which fertility&#13;
responds to mortality and national and cross-national studies of associated&#13;
levels of mortality and fertility. The doubts that have been raised about&#13;
this association will be noted, and then some analysis will be reported of the&#13;
temporal association using World Bank data on developing countries for 1950-&#13;
80.&#13;
PREVIOUS STUDIES&#13;
That fertility and mortality are somehow interdependent may appear&#13;
evident, since the consequences of one parameter changing while the other&#13;
remains constant are dramatic. An illustration at the household level is&#13;
useful. If the total fertility rate stays constant at 7.0 while expectation&#13;
of life at birth rises from 25 to 75, the number of children surviving to age&#13;
20, for the average couple, would more than double, going from 3.21 to 6.85&#13;
(Bongaarts and Menken, 1983). It is reasonable to expect that such a&#13;
significant change would require major readjustments within each household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Both biological and behavioral links have been proposed between&#13;
mortality and fertility.&#13;
O    At the biological level, lower infant mortality rates (which account&#13;
for a substantial portion of the typical mortality decline) should lengthen&#13;
interbirth Lntervals, because an infant death brings an early end to the&#13;
period of postpartum infecundability.&#13;
o    Longer child survival may reduce the need for parents to "replace"&#13;
any children of their own who have died through additional births.&#13;
O    Longer survival, as parents perceive it to spread within the&#13;
community, may reduce their motivation to "hoard" extra children as a&#13;
guarantee against possible deaths.&#13;
O    Longer survival should decrease the cost per surviving child but&#13;
increase the cost per birth, with uncertain effect. It may also change the&#13;
way parents relate to their children, increasing their emotional investment in&#13;
each one and their concern with "child quality," thereby increasing the&#13;
propensity to favor smaller families.&#13;
These four mechanisms may be supplemented by two explanations for an&#13;
association between mortality and fertility that do not imply causal&#13;
mechanisms triggered by mortality decline.&#13;
o    Given the integration of many family planning programs with health&#13;
service delivery, falling mortality and falling fertility may have interlinked&#13;
sources. If such integrated programs are more successful than nonintegrated&#13;
programs, such an association would be strengthened.&#13;
O    In scarcity situations where high fertility may be a severe burden,&#13;
high infant and child mortality might reflect either deliberate infanticide or&#13;
infanticide through neglect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Much better evidence exists on the first two of these links than on&#13;
the others. The biological effect can be observed among women who have never&#13;
used contraception. A neonatal death shortens the birth interval by 3.2 to&#13;
6.0 months, and a postneonatal death by 1.7 to 3.8 months (Cochrane and&#13;
Zachariah, 1983:6). The effect of an infant death should be greater the&#13;
longer the period typically devoted to full breastfeeding.&#13;
The replacement effect has also been observed in a number of&#13;
studies: in Taiwan, for instance, an infant death leads to a desire for an&#13;
additional number of children varying from 0.07 to 0.60 (Heer and Wu, 1975,&#13;
1978). These numbers indicate desired replacement; those who actually succeed&#13;
in replacing lost children may be fewer. Together, the biological effect and&#13;
the replacement effect mean that a fall in mortality of one child per family&#13;
implies a fall in fertility of between 0.14 births (in Sri Lanka) and 0.81&#13;
births (in Syria) (Cochrane and Zachariah, 1983:iii; cf. Trussell and Olson,&#13;
1983).&#13;
The next two links depend on parents' responses to subjective&#13;
probabilities of survival for their children. These probabilities originate&#13;
in perceptions of survival levels in the community at large or within narrowly&#13;
defined social groups. Studies of the effect of perceived levels of child&#13;
survival are equivocal: a Taiwan study shows some fertility response in the&#13;
predicted direction after individual-level variables are controlled, but a&#13;
Guatemalan study does not (Heer and Wu, 1975, 1978; Pebley and others,&#13;
1979). The actual level of child survival in the community did make the&#13;
expected difference in contraceptive use in one study in Egypt (Rizk and&#13;
others, 1980).&#13;
For the last two explanations for a mortality-fertility link there is&#13;
little hard evidence. Although the effect of integrated programs in producing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
a link sounds plausible, such programs are relatively recent and still&#13;
limited, and their consequences so far not fully explored. On the reverse&#13;
effect of high fertility on infanticide there is some speculation and&#13;
anecdotal evidence (Scrimshaw, 1978, 1983). More tellingly, some inferences&#13;
can be drawn from historical European patterns and literary works to indicate&#13;
that child abandonment was a common practice (van de Walle and Knodel, 1980).&#13;
Given that some of these mechanisms are supported by evidence, one&#13;
would expect: to find a reasonably consistent link between mortality and&#13;
fertility patterns. Cross-national studies in fact usually find such a link,&#13;
though not in all circumstances. Across most developing countries, some&#13;
association appears, but not at high levels of development (Richards, 1983).&#13;
For instance, Gregory and Campbell (1976) find that fertility and mortality&#13;
are positively related only across populations that are less than 80 percent&#13;
urban. Similarly, Entwisle and Winegarden (1981) confirm a positive&#13;
relationship up to a life expectancy of about 53 years (see also Chenery and&#13;
Syrquin, 1977; Oeschli and Kirk, 1975).&#13;
Also using cross-sectional data, Tsui and Bogue (1978) find that&#13;
fertility does relate to infant mortality levels seven years before. The lag&#13;
structure is also evident in time series studies for Puerto Rico and Taiwan.&#13;
In Puerto Rico, a positive association appears between the crude death rate,&#13;
lagged three and four years, and fertility (Nerlove and Schultz, 1970). In&#13;
Taiwan, a consistent positive relationship is found between child mortality,&#13;
lagged three years, and fertility, especially among older women (Schultz,&#13;
1973). Using five- and seven-year differences, Hermalin (1978) also finds&#13;
that change in child mortality five years earlier relates to change in&#13;
fertility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Whether fertility responds, in these studies, to mortality itself or&#13;
to the health conditions or levels of morbidity that are closely associated&#13;
with it cannot be determined.&#13;
Skepticism about the link between mortality decline and fertility&#13;
decline has come from a different quarter. Reviewing the experience of the&#13;
fertility transition in Germany, Knodel (1974) found earlier fertility&#13;
declines in administrative areas with higher infant mortality. Knodel and van&#13;
de Walle (1979), in an influential paper, generalize this finding to other&#13;
European countries, showing that significant fertility decline (a fall in&#13;
marital fertility of at least 10 percent) started at widely varying levels of&#13;
infant mortality, from 69 in Ireland (in 1929) to 250 in Hungary (about&#13;
1890). In most cases, child mortality did begin to decline before fertility,&#13;
but the lags were highly variable and some countries showed infant mortality&#13;
starting its decline after or at the same time as fertility decline.&#13;
Knodel and van de Walle (1979:224) believe that the same variability&#13;
in the relationship between mortality decline and fertility decline exists in&#13;
the developing countries: "Significantly, in most countries of the world&#13;
today infant mortality has fallen substantially. There is little evidence&#13;
that this fall has been sufficient in itself to initiate a drop in the birth&#13;
rate." They tabulate fertility decline and infant mortality levels for only&#13;
four countries (Costa Rica, Taiwan, Chile, and Thailand) but appear to be&#13;
generalizing from broader knowledge of developing countries.&#13;
The argument to this point can be summarized as follows. Evidence&#13;
exists to substantiate biological as well as some behavioral links between&#13;
infant and child mortality and fertility. Good cross-national evidence and&#13;
some time series evidence for specific countries also exist that show that&#13;
mortality levels are related to fertility levels, most likely with a few years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
lag. However, the initiation of fertility decline showed no relationship to&#13;
mortality level in the European experience, and, it has been argued, shows no&#13;
relationship either in developing countries today.&#13;
The object of this exercise is to attempt to confirm or disconfirm&#13;
the link between mortality decline and fertility transition across developing&#13;
countries. Microlevel research favors such an effect; lower mortality could&#13;
reduce the hoarding response or change fertility preferences. Such an effect&#13;
is essentially aggregate and difficult to observe at the individual level,&#13;
however. Consequently the focus here will be exclusively cross-national.&#13;
DATA AND METHOD&#13;
The mortality and fertility data to be used are drawn from World Bank&#13;
files (as of mid-1983). Mortality is indexed by the expectation of life at&#13;
birth (eo) for men and women combined. Given Knodel and van de Walle's&#13;
observations about the differences in the decline pattern for infant and for&#13;
child mortaLity in Europe, eO should be safer to use as a summary measure than&#13;
either of these. The fertility indicator will be the total fertility rate&#13;
(TFR).&#13;
The World Bank files provide year-by-year estimates of TFR and eO for&#13;
the majority of the 124 countries and territories covered here. For a dozen&#13;
countries, TFR is available at five or fewer points, and for another ten&#13;
countries TFR is missing for a few years, usually at the beginning or at the&#13;
end of the series. There are similar but not identical gaps in the mortality&#13;
series. Particular countries are therefore left out where appropriate below.&#13;
The analysis involves three steps: (a) identifying appropriate&#13;
criteria for the start of a fertility transition; (b) determining mortality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
levels and trends in those countries with established fertility declines; and&#13;
(c) determining the fertility trends that follow such mortality patterns.&#13;
The World Bank estimates are derived by interpolation from five-year&#13;
average TFRs, mostly obtained from the U.N. Population Division. The&#13;
Population Division, in turn, draws on official estimates as well as various&#13;
governmental and academic sources and adjusts their figures for consistency&#13;
with other figures on population size and age-sex structure (United Nations,&#13;
1982). The World Bank estimates, therefore, do not correspond directly to&#13;
estimates from census, survey, or registration data, though they are&#13;
ultimately based on them.&#13;
These data clearly have serious limitations. For a given country,&#13;
they may be based on only a few reliable figures, and smoothing and&#13;
interpolation provide the rest. It is unwise to put total credence in them.&#13;
An additional step therefore will be to examine other data sources, especially&#13;
for countries that appear anomalous.&#13;
RESULTS&#13;
Identifying the start of a fertility transition&#13;
A fertility transition is understood here as a significant, one-time&#13;
decline in fertility from relatively high premodern levels to levels close to&#13;
replacement, brought about largely through a substantial increase in marital&#13;
fertility regulation, and usually accompanying socioeconomic development or&#13;
modernization. Not every fertility decline should be considered part of a&#13;
transition process. To distinguish a transitional from a nontransitional&#13;
decline, the size of the decline wilL be used, as well as the fertility level&#13;
eventually attained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
A fertility transition will be identified from either (1) a sizable&#13;
fall in the total fertility rate over any five-year period, or (2) a country's&#13;
attaining a low TFR. Choosing five years as the period across which to&#13;
measure declines in TFR allows one to observe fertility transitions that&#13;
started as late as 1975, but no later. For transitions too gradual to be&#13;
picked up from five-year changes, the second criterion--having attained a low&#13;
total fertility rate--should often apply.&#13;
Knodel and van de Walle identified the start of a fertility&#13;
transition in European countries as that point from which marital fertility&#13;
(measured by Coale's Ig index) started a fall of at least 10 percent. This&#13;
criterion is more useful historically than in the present context. For&#13;
contemporaneous societies the point from which a 10 percent decline should be&#13;
measured is less clear, given pretransition fluctuations in fertility.&#13;
Furthermore, with data covering a much shorter span than the historical&#13;
record, this criterion could shorten the useful period of observation.&#13;
Finally, the Ig index is not generally available across developing&#13;
countries. TFRs, by contrast, include the effects of changes in marital&#13;
patterns. Since fertility transition in developing countries today, in&#13;
contrast to the European transitions, typically includes some delay in age at&#13;
marriage (Smith, 1980; Bongaarts, 1982), taking marriage pattern changes into&#13;
account is appropriate. The Knodel-van de Walle criterion implies that, at&#13;
initially lower fertility levels, a smaller fall in rates should be sufficient&#13;
to identify fertility transition. However, some study of TFR patterns in&#13;
developing countries (in the preceding paper) suggests that they fall in&#13;
roughly linear fashion in the critical phase at the start of a fertility&#13;
transition. Thus the first criterion used here involves the absolute fall in&#13;
TFR rather than a percentage change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Table 1 shows the countries that would be identified as having&#13;
started a fertility transition using alternative criteria: five-year falls in&#13;
TFR of at least 1.0, 0.7, and 0.5 points, and having attained a TFR below 4.5,&#13;
5.0, and 5.5. The majority of countries appear in one of the two extreme&#13;
groups: 61 have no observable decline by any criterion and 20 show&#13;
unmistakable decline by the most stringent combined criteria.&#13;
Should the intermediate groups be considered to have started a&#13;
fertility transition? Some case can be made for fertility transition in most&#13;
of the countries in which TFR fell by at least 0.7. This cutoff effectively&#13;
excludes all countries with TFRs above 5.5. Countries with TFR falls of only&#13;
0.5 are somewhat more doubtful: some may be considered to have started&#13;
fertility transitions, some not. (Setting an intermediate level, a TFR fall&#13;
of 0.6, would not improve the situation, since Pakistan and Paraguay would&#13;
still be included.)&#13;
There are however 10 countries with TFRs below 4.5 for which a TFR&#13;
fall of 0.7 was not observed. For three of these--Argentina, Uruguay, and&#13;
Gabon (which requires further comment below)--TFR was already below 4.5 in&#13;
1950, and any TFR fall of this magnitude probably took place before that&#13;
date. For four others, data were sufficient to observe a low level but too&#13;
scanty to observe a fall in TFR. Three cases (North Korea, Panama, Sri Lanka)&#13;
remain that represent declines too slow for sizeable five-year changes to&#13;
appear.&#13;
To determine whether fertility decline had actually taken place in&#13;
these three cases, other data were consulted. The Bank data for North Korea&#13;
are largely extrapolations; no other data are available from which to confirm&#13;
any fertility decline. In Panama, the decline was probably not as gradual as&#13;
the Bank estimates suggest. A recent reevaluation (Medica, 1979) suggests&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
that fertility was relatively constant until about 1970, and that a fairly&#13;
rapid decline in TFR (meeting the criterion for a rapid decline) occurred&#13;
thereafter. The Bank series extends this decline back over the 1960s,&#13;
explaining why it appears so gradual. A fertility transition is widely&#13;
recognized to be under way in Sri Lanka. Several sources cited by the U.S.&#13;
Bureau of the Census (1979) give similar estimates for the 1960s, confirming&#13;
the gradual decline in this decade. For the 1970s data are more sparse, but&#13;
where they exist they indicate a sharper fall in TFR than the Bank estimates,&#13;
down to 3.7 in 1974, for instance, in contrast to 4.1 in the Bank series. It&#13;
is possible, therefore, that transitional fertility decline in Sri Lanka did&#13;
not start before the later 1960s, but did meet the criterion for at least a&#13;
moderate decline. Where data are available, therefore, countries with TFRs&#13;
below 4.5 do appear to have started fertility transition.&#13;
The temporal relation between a fall in TFR and reaching a TFR of 4.5&#13;
should be noted. Among 20 countries, 65 percent attained a TFR below 4.5&#13;
between 6 and 10 years after TFR began to fall rapidly (by at least 1.0). The&#13;
median lag was 7 years. Among eight other countries whose TFR fell at least&#13;
0.7 but less than 1.0, the lag was more variable, but the median lag was&#13;
almost the same, at 6.5 years.&#13;
From this information, alternative criteria were chosen for the year&#13;
in which a fertility decline associated with fertility transition started.&#13;
(1) A "substantial" decline is defined to have started in the first year in&#13;
which TFR began a five-year fall of at least 1.0 points. (2) A "moderate"&#13;
decline is defined to have started in the first year in which TFR began a&#13;
five-year fall of at least 0.7 points. A moderate decline almost always&#13;
predates a substantial decline by one to five years (Taiwan being an&#13;
exception, with a gap of eight years), but does not guarantee that a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
substantial decline will follow. (3) Those countries with TFRs below 4.5 are&#13;
also said to have gone through some part of a fertility transition. As an&#13;
approximation, where neither "substantial" nor "moderate" TFR falls could be&#13;
observed, their declines were assumed to have started seven years before this&#13;
fertility level was reached, and to have been "gradual." (The three countries&#13;
in this category for which data were available in the Bank series showed five-&#13;
year TFR faLls from this date of 0.6 or 0.5.)&#13;
The criteria of TFR declines of 0.7 and 1.0 effectively straddle the&#13;
Knodel-van de Walle criterion of a 10 percent decline in marital fertility&#13;
(Ig). Though the TFR criteria both exceed 10 percent of the average starting&#13;
TFR, unlike Ig declines TFR declines include marriage pattern changes.&#13;
Specific cornparisons can be made for the four developing countries Knodel and&#13;
van de Walle cite. For Costa Rica, they date the start of fertility&#13;
transition from 1962, which is exactly the date at which a substantial TFR&#13;
decline of 1.0 starts. A TFR decline of 0.7 starts one year earlier, in&#13;
1961. For Taiwan, a moderate TFR decline starts in 1957, a 10 percent decline&#13;
in Ig starts in 1963, and a substantial TFR decline starts in 1965. For&#13;
Chile, a moderate TFR decline starts in 1961 and a 10 percent Ig decline in&#13;
1964; no substantial TFR decline is identified. For Thailand, finally, a&#13;
moderate TFR decline starts in 1968, a 10 percent decline in Ig around 1970,&#13;
and a substantial TFR decline in 1972. The starting dates for TFR declines in&#13;
each country bracket the dates identified by the Knodel-van de Walle&#13;
criterion, coming quite close.&#13;
Examination of Table 1 suggests several cases that are misidentified&#13;
as having started a fertility transition: Gabon and Kampuchea, certainly, and&#13;
probably also Cape Verde. To avoid introducing any bias, these cases were not&#13;
excluded; they will be discussed among the special cases below.&#13;

mean year in which substantial fertility declines were observed to start, and&#13;
1975 is the last year in which any fertility decline could have been observed&#13;
to start in these data). Finally, Table 3 also shows the rise in eO over the&#13;
five years preceding the start of fertility decline and over the ten preceding&#13;
years.&#13;
The changes in eO prior to fertility decline are not dramatic. The&#13;
five-year rise is almost identical to the rise among countries with no&#13;
fertility decline, and the ten-year rise only slightly higher among the&#13;
countries with fertility decline.&#13;
On the other hand, mortality levels are substantially different&#13;
between the decline and nondecline groups. Expectation of life is much higher&#13;
in countries which have experienced fertility decline. Means are at least ten&#13;
years above those for nondecline countries. This gap is not narrowed by going&#13;
back five years or ten years. Figure 1 clearly demonstrates the distinction&#13;
between the groups with and without decline. The bulk of each decline group&#13;
is clearly separated from the bulk of each nondecline group by a boundary&#13;
somewhere between an eO of 50 and 55, the boundary falling as one goes farther&#13;
back in time. Only outliers overlap between decline and nondecline groups.&#13;
The outliers in the decline groups deserve some attention. Among&#13;
countries with substantial fertility declines, only Kampuchea and Cape Verde&#13;

started their declines with eos below 56. In both of these cases, there is&#13;
doubt about whether fertility transition has in fact started (as is discussed&#13;
further below). For moderate fertility declines (including those for&#13;
countries which also show substantial fertility declines), the minimum eO at&#13;
the start is 53, with, once again, Kampuchea and Cape Verde as exceptions.&#13;
For the five countries with data in the gradual-decline group, the minimum is&#13;
even higher at 61, with no exceptions.&#13;
An eO of 53 may therefore be taken as a threshold below which no&#13;
fertility transition has started. This life expectancy corresponds to an&#13;
infant mortality rate ranging from 90 to 130, depending on the model life&#13;
table used; the Coale and Demeny West model and the new U.N. General pattern&#13;
would place infant mortality in the 100-105 range. Ignoring Kampuchea and&#13;
Cape Verde, a threshold also appears for five years before the fertility&#13;
transition (eO at least 50, though Tunisia was 0.2 years below) and for ten&#13;
years before (eO at least 47). These thresholds are to some extent&#13;
independent, in the sense that meeting one does not guarantee that the next&#13;
will be met. To illustrate, it was noted from the same data that five years&#13;
after first reaching an eO of 50, only 60 percent of developing countries had&#13;
progressed to an eO of 53. For substantial fertility declines, higher&#13;
thresholds appear (respectively, 56, 53, and 49).&#13;
Special cases&#13;
Several countries require special attention. Kampuchea and Cape&#13;
Verde show apparent declines at high mortality levels. Cabon appears to have&#13;
much lower Eertility than is usually observed in a country with high&#13;
mortality. China, Argentina, Uruguay, and several small countries have no&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
mortality data in the Bank series for the years preceding fertility decline.&#13;
And Indonesia is an interesting case showing no transitional fertility decline&#13;
before 1976 by the criteria used here, despite other evidence.&#13;
Gabon will be considered together with Kampuchea and Cape Verde as an&#13;
apparent exception to the threshold requirement. In each of these cases,&#13;
there is serious question as to whether fertility transition has in fact&#13;
started. For Gabon, the low estimates of fertility appear valid. Fertility&#13;
is believed to have been low for several decades, at least, because of a high&#13;
level of subfecundity in the population (Republique Gabonaise Service de&#13;
Statistique, 1960-61; Languillat, 1978). For Kampuchea, low fertility (around&#13;
3.5 in the late 1970s) was associated with a period of considerable internal&#13;
turmoil after the takeover by the Khmer Rouge. Fertility is estimated to have&#13;
decreased sharply at the same time that mortality rose sharply; both rebounded&#13;
after a few years. Thus fertility decline is largely attributable to&#13;
temporary, extremely adverse conditions. Fertility levels in Cape Verde,&#13;
similarly, appear to be the result of rather special conditions. Famines have&#13;
periodically depressed fertility. In the early 1970s the crude birth rate&#13;
fell by 25 percent, largely because of heavy male outmigration. After&#13;
independence in 1975 and the return of many male inhabitants, the crude birth&#13;
rate returned almost to previous levels (Diaz-Briquets, 1983). With a TFR&#13;
estimated to be around 6, Cape Verde apparently has not started transitional&#13;
fertility decline. None of these cases, therefore, is a valid exception to&#13;
the threshold hypothesis.&#13;
Two of the largest developing countries, China and Indonesia, deserve&#13;
special attention. The Bank series suggests substantial fertility decline for&#13;
China beginning in 1954. What is being picked up here, however, is a&#13;
precipitate fall in fertility, especially in 1959-61, associated with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Great Leap F'orward and with famine. Fertility returned to and even exceeded&#13;
previous levels in the following years, reaching a peak of 7.5 in 1963, and&#13;
then beginning a remarkable and rapid decline to 2.5 by 1980 (Hill, 1983;&#13;
Coale, 1984). The start of fertility transition should probably be dated not&#13;
from 1954 ncr from the peak year of 1963, but from some time in the mid to&#13;
late 1960s, when mortality had receded from the crisis levels of 1959-61. By&#13;
the mid-1960s, expectation of life was still slightly below 45, but it was&#13;
rising rapidly, and by 1970 was close to 55.&#13;
For Indonesia, the Bank series shows no fertility decline, by the&#13;
criteria used here, up to 1975. Estimates of TFR for particular years given&#13;
by McNicoll and Singarimbun (1983) largely correspond to the Bank series, but&#13;
their estimate for the later 1970s is slightly lower. It is 4.7 for 1976-79,&#13;
as contrasted to 4.9 to 4.6 over the same period in the Bank estimates.&#13;
Although this difference is small, it is just sufficient to translate the&#13;
fertility decline from around 1972 into a moderate decline. This is&#13;
consistent with the date for the start of the family planning program on the&#13;
central islands of Java and Bali, which has had much widely recognized&#13;
success. Initiated in 1969, the program was "seriously underway" only in 1971&#13;
(Hull and others, 1977). Expectation of life in the mid-1970s was estimated&#13;
at about 50 (Indonesia Panel, 1982); the Bank series gives 49 for 1972, a few&#13;
years below the threshold. For both China and Indonesia, therefore, life&#13;
expectancy was close to the threshold when fertility transition began, and was&#13;
rising rapidly, but it is not possible to say definitely that the threshold&#13;
was met.&#13;
Several small countries or territories that have started fertility&#13;
transition have incomplete mortality data. The available data from other&#13;
sources uniformly indicate that mortality was in fact at low levels when the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
transition started. Prior to or within a few years of the start of fertility&#13;
decline, eO exceeded 60 in American Samoa, Grenada, and Samoa (U.N.&#13;
Demographic Yearbook, various years). This was also true for the Bahamas; the&#13;
decline there probably started much earlier than 1970, but even ten years&#13;
before that eO had already passed 60. For Guam, no eos are available, but&#13;
crude death rates below 6.0 were reported for the early 1960s at the start of&#13;
fertility decline. No data have been located for Macao.&#13;
Since the Bank series begins with 1950, mortality data are not&#13;
available for Argentina and Uruguay at the time their fertility began to&#13;
decline. These declines actually started several decades previously; both&#13;
countries have recorded relatively low levels of fertility for some time, and&#13;
both are in the late stages of transition. Data before 1950 are available&#13;
only for Argentina (de Lattes and de Lattes, 1975), and only for selected&#13;
years (1869, 1895, 1914, and 1947). Fertility was probably highest for the&#13;
country as a whole in the 1880s, a time when life expectancy was about 33&#13;
years. The national estimate is heavily influenced, however, by the Buenos&#13;
Aires area; in all other areas, the highest fertility rates (of the years&#13;
available) are recorded for 1914, when life expectancy was about 48.5 years&#13;
for the country as a whole. Since 1950, fertility in Argentina has continued&#13;
a slow decline, while fertility in Uruguay has fluctuated with little apparent&#13;
trend in the range of 2.7 to 3.0. Because of the early date for the fertility&#13;
decline, Argentina (and Uruguay, which probably followed a similar pattern,&#13;
and possibly Cuba, where fertility decline started in the 1920s) resembles&#13;
developed more than other developing countries. The likelihood is strong that&#13;
these declines started when mortality was higher, as did those in many&#13;
European countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
Three main implications may be drawn from this review of selected&#13;
cases. First, the criteria for transitional fertility decline have one&#13;
important limitation: they fail to exclude nontransitional, catastrophic&#13;
declines that result from natural disasters or severe social disorganization&#13;
(including substantial outmigration in smaller societies). Adding the&#13;
requirement that TFR does not rise substantially later would probably&#13;
eliminate such cases. Second, China might be an exception to the threshold&#13;
requirement, though just barely. Fertility decline paralleled extremely&#13;
rapid mortalLty decline, and could have started a couple of years before the&#13;
mortality threshold was met. Indonesia similarly might have started a&#13;
fertility transition slightly earlier than would be expected. Third,&#13;
Argentina and Uruguay are special cases with very early declines, as early as&#13;
and possibly earlier than such European countries as Spain (1918) and Ireland&#13;
(1929). Argentina and Uruguay also follow the European pattern in having&#13;
started their declines at higher mortality levels.&#13;
Fertility effects of mortality decline&#13;
Figure 1 suggests that some countries that reach an eO of 53 may be&#13;
delayed in starting a fertility transition. To confirm this, and to determine&#13;
what the lag is like, consideration will now be given to fertility trends&#13;
after a country reaches this level of eo, as well as after it reaches an eo of&#13;
56 (the minimum for a substantial fertility decline) and, for comparison,&#13;
higher e0s of 60 and 65.&#13;
Table 3 shows the proportion of countries that embark on fertility&#13;
decline (whether substantial, moderate, or gradual) within particular&#13;
intervals after attaining each specified mortality level. These proportions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
were calculated year by year, and aggregated where necessary, taking into&#13;
account the number of countries that must be left out each year because their&#13;
fertility series end (see Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 1980:11-16). The&#13;
estimated survivor functions (proportions of countries that have not started a&#13;
fertility transition up to particular intervals) are plotted in Figure 2.&#13;
A few countries experienced fertility decline before eO reached the&#13;
specified levels. Where an eO of 53 was specified, these countries were&#13;
Kampuchea and Cape Verde, as noted above. Where a high eO of 65 was&#13;
specified, over half had begun fertility decline beforehand. It is equally&#13;
notable, however, that 48 percent had not. Fertility decline came sooner&#13;
after a country attained higher rather than lower levels of eo, as one would&#13;
expect. Within 10 years of attaining an eO of 53, 39 percent had started a&#13;
fertility decline, in contrast to 58 percent for an eO of 56. Nevertheless,&#13;
up to 20 years after having attained any of the specified eO levels, a few&#13;
countries (10 to 16 percent) still had not initiated a fertility transition.&#13;
It was noted earlier that countries that experience fertility decline&#13;
already had lower mortality several years before the decline started. To&#13;
determine whether experience prior to attaining an eO of 53 might account for&#13;
some of the delay in starting a fertility transition, countries were divided&#13;
into two groups: those whose eO five years before reaching 53 was at 50 or&#13;
below, and those whose eO five years before was above 50. Survivor functions&#13;
for these two groups--for up to 10 years, since at longer intervals numbers of&#13;
cases become quite small--were inconclusive. The 50-and-below group (with&#13;
only nine countries initially) had an early advantage but was overtaken by the&#13;
above-50 group. In estimates extended to 20 years, the above-50 group had a&#13;
surprisingly high proportion of cases, 38 percent, with no fertility decline&#13;
to that point.&#13;

Similar survivor functions were plotted for countries that were at or&#13;
below an eO of 53 five years before reaching an e0 of 56. In this case the&#13;
results were clearer. Having had a lower mortality level previously did&#13;
appear to hasten fertility decline: after 10 years, 86 percent of the above-&#13;
53 group as opposed to 57 percent of the 53-and-below group had started&#13;
fertility transition. Nevertheless, a previous low mortality level was not a&#13;
guarantee of fertility decline.&#13;
Survivor functions by continent, from a starting eO of 53, are&#13;
plotted in Figure 3. The longest lag before fertility decline starts appeared&#13;
in Latin America and the Caribbean. For Asia and the Pacific, and for Africa&#13;
and the Middle East too (where most of the decline has taken place in the&#13;
Middle East or in island countries), a somewhat faster pace was evident.&#13;
After 10 years, only 23 percent of the Latin American and Caribbean countries&#13;
had started fertility decline, in contrast to 47 percent in Africa and the&#13;
Middle East and 69 percent in Asia and the Pacific.&#13;
The impression that the lag is getting shorter over time is&#13;
reinforced in Figure 4, which shows survivor functions for two groups: those&#13;
that attained an eO of 53 in the 1950s and those that attained this eO in the&#13;
1960s. Fertility decline appeared to occur sooner in the 1960s cohort than in&#13;
the 1950s cohort.&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
No fertility transition has been observed to start in any developing&#13;
country until expectation of life at birth had stayed above 50 for at least&#13;
five years and finally reached at least 53. China and Indonesia come close to&#13;
meeting the threshold of 53; it is not certain whether or not they are&#13;

exceptions. The rapidity of mortality decline appears to be less important&#13;
than staying at or above these eO levels (except possibly in China and&#13;
Indonesia). An eO of 53 thus has been, in the recent past, almost always a&#13;
necessary condition for fertility transition, and an eO of 56 a necessary&#13;
condition for a rapid transition. The thresholds apply at the national level;&#13;
whether fertility decline is possible in particular regions in a country at&#13;
higher mortality levels has not been determined.&#13;
In addition, it is clear that reaching either of these mortality&#13;
levels is not a sufficient condition for fertility transition, since many&#13;
countries have not started a fertility transition even as much as 20 years&#13;
after. The analysis here has been strictly bivariate, involving only&#13;
mortality and fertility, but that does not invalidate the identification of&#13;
necessary thresholds. It might, however, explain the failure to identify&#13;
sufficient thresholds for fertility transition. It is possible that factors&#13;
like education, urbanization, and contraceptive availability also have to&#13;
attain particular levels, individually or in combination, before transition&#13;
starts.&#13;
The threshold levels of e0 are higher than the levels for roughly three-&#13;
fourths of the reported European cases at the time their fertility transitions&#13;
started (Knodel and van de Walle, 1979:221). This important distinction&#13;
between the historical transitions and contemporary transitions in developing&#13;
countries is perhaps too easy to explain, since there are so many differences&#13;
between the two situations. Given that mortality is falling at lower levels&#13;
of development today (Davis, 1956; Preston, 1975), the contrast might be&#13;
accounted for if fertility decline were mainly responsive to development&#13;
levels, and only indirectly to mortality. In addition, European levels of&#13;
infant and child mortality may reflect much deliberate abandonment or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
"infanticide by neglect" (van de Walle and Knodel, 1980). Purged of these&#13;
cases, "'true' levels could possibly have been lower.&#13;
If most countries were above the eO thresholds of 53 or 56 today, the&#13;
thresholds would be essentially irrelevant. This is not the case, however.&#13;
The majority of countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia had eos below&#13;
53 in 1983, as did an assortment of countries in other regions, such as&#13;
Bolivia, Laos, and both Yemens.&#13;
Once the threshold is crossed, what determines how soon fertility&#13;
decline takes place? This question has not been explored in depth here. It&#13;
does appear, however, that fertility decline is taking place more quickly&#13;
after the threshold mortality levels are reached in Asia and the&#13;
Middle East than in Latin America, and in more recent decades than in earlier&#13;
ones.&#13;
From the perspective of demographic policy, the link between&#13;
mortality recduction and population growth has often appeared problematic.&#13;
That mortality reduction contributes to fertility decline has sometimes been&#13;
used as a justification for concern with reducing mortality in countries&#13;
facing rapid population growth. However, the microlevel studies discussed&#13;
earlier show that the fertility response to mortality is relatively weak. A&#13;
child death is never fully replaced: the level of replacement is almost&#13;
always below 0.5 and is typically around 0.25. Trussell and Olson (1983:392)&#13;
can argue, therefore: "These estimates left health programs far from&#13;
exonerated of the charge that, despite being socially desirable in their own&#13;
right, their demographic consequences were deleterious."&#13;
If one ignores the contribution of reduced mortality to population&#13;
growth and focuses only on its fertility consequences, the case for mortality&#13;
reduction is not greatly advanced. It does not appear to be a cost-effective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
approach to fertility control. This can be determined if one accepts a number&#13;
of heroic assumptions, especially about the cost of averting deaths. Such&#13;
cost estimates vary considerably: Cochrane and Zachariah (1983:24) report&#13;
costs per death averted ranging from $7.75 in a prenatal nutrition program in&#13;
Narangwal, India, and $24 in a mass vaccination program (for BCG) in Morocco,&#13;
up to $1,100 in the same vaccination program (when polio vaccine was&#13;
considered) and $6,357 also for polio vaccination in Kenya. Disease patterns&#13;
and the health and environmental situation vary greatly across developing&#13;
countries, and widely divergent estimates like these should be expected.&#13;
Taking $250 as the average cost per averted death, Cochrane and Zachariah show&#13;
that, in almost all of the 16 countries with a family planning program they&#13;
consider, the program averts births more cheaply than measures to reduce&#13;
mortality. The cost per birth averted is on the order of ten times as great&#13;
from a health program alone than from a family planning program. The link&#13;
between mortality and fertility at the individual level is not strong enough&#13;
to allow the resultant fertility reduction to compensate for additional growth&#13;
due to mortality reduction. Partly because the relationship is weak, health&#13;
programs appear to be an inefficient approach to fertility control.&#13;
The analysis reported here, however, throws a different light on the&#13;
issue. If mortality must fall below some threshold before fertility declines,&#13;
then what it adds to population growth is an unavoidable price that must be&#13;
paid if lower fertility is ever to be reached. Beyond the threshold this&#13;
argument does not apply, and the contribution to growth of further mortality&#13;
decline may have to be carefully weighed.&#13;
It does not necessarily follow that efforts at fertility control&#13;
should be put off until the mortality threshold is crossed. Putting a family&#13;
planning program in place can take time, resources, and political effort, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
having one ready ahead of time may ensure a quicker fertility transition once&#13;
mortality is sufficiently low. One should not, however, expect too much of a&#13;
family planning program until that time.&#13;
Is it conceivable that the threshold may change or even disappear,&#13;
with advances in biomedical and social technologies for fertility control or&#13;
with changies in the pattern of societal development? Answering this question&#13;
requires some understanding of the mechanisms underlying the threshold.&#13;
Possible mechanisms linking mortality to fertility were discussed earlier, but&#13;
the specific reasons for a threshold have not been investigated here, so that&#13;
a satisfaczory answer to the question cannot be provided. If the threshold&#13;
exists because some level of personal and family security, represented by a&#13;
higher life expectancy, is essential before individuals attempt to control&#13;
fertility, then a more serious threat to security from excessive population&#13;
growth might conceivably lower the threshold. However, if the threshold&#13;
exists because of the links between development and lower mortality, on the&#13;
one hand, and development and lower fertility, on the other, then it may be&#13;
more likely that the threshold will actually rise, as it has in comparison to&#13;
the European experience. Regardless of movement in the threshold, there&#13;
certainly is scope for reducing the lag between reaching satisfactory eO&#13;
levels and starting a fertility transition, a lag which does in fact appear to&#13;
be shrinking.&#13;

            Fertility and mortality transition :
            patterns, projections and interdependence
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The first of the two papers in this
            report describes and provides representations of the
            patterns of rapid fertility and rapid mortality decline in
            developing countries. Rapid mortality decline is represented
            by a logistic equation for increase in life expectancy at
            birth estimated from World Bank data for the 14 developing
            countries with the most rapid declines between 1950 and
            1980. Rapid fertility decline, for 11 selected developing
            countries, is shown to be adequately represented by a linear
            decline in the total fertility rate of about 0.22 points a
            year. The second of these two papers concerns the linkage
            between fertility and mortality transition. Some effect of
            mortality decline on fertility decline is widely posted, and
            behavioral evidence exists to support particular linkages.
            Using World Bank data, an attempt is made to link the timing
            of fertility transition to levels of life expectancy at
            birth. Transition is defined to start in the year that total
            fertility begins a five-year drop of at least 0.7 points.
