                           I. COUNTRYBACKGROUNDANDSTRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
A. CountryBackground&#13;
&#13;
1.    Buildingan effective state - that can provide security and services to the people, while protecting&#13;
their rights - has been at the heart o f the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. At the end o f 2001, after&#13;
nearly a quarter century o f wars and civil strife the political systemhad largely collapsed. While many o f&#13;
the formal structures and some o fthe traditional practices o f public administration remainedinplace, they&#13;
lacked the human, financial and physical resources to do their job, particularly in a modem context. The&#13;
new government faced enormous challenges in restoring security, talung charge o f running the country,&#13;
building consensus across various political factions and rebuilding the very limited capacity o f the state.&#13;
Inthis context, remarkable progresshas beenmade inrestoring institutions of governance and laying the&#13;
basis for a strong economic recovery inorder to improve livelihoods.&#13;
&#13;
2.    On the political front, achievements have been signifcant: A new Constitution was adopted in&#13;
January 2004 and Afghans actively participatedinelections for their first democratically elected President&#13;
(former Chairman o f the Afghan Transitional Administration, Hamid Karzai) in December 2004.&#13;
Elections for the Wolesi Jirgu (lower house o f the National Assembly) and for provincial councils took&#13;
place in September 2005. Female turnout in both elections was around 40 percent o f the total electorate&#13;
and more than a quarter o f Wolesi Jirgu members are female. The inauguration o f the National&#13;
Assembly inDecember 2005 markedthe formal conclusion o fthe Bonnpolitical transition process.&#13;
&#13;
3.    Afghanistan's economy has recovered stronglyfrom a state of collapse at the end of the Taliban&#13;
rule. The real value o f non-opium Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 29 percent in 2002/03,&#13;
16 percent in 2003/04, 8 percent in 2004/05, and 14 percent in 2005/06. This solid performance was&#13;
supported by the government's sound macroeconomic polices. Afghanistan has successfully completed&#13;
all quarterly reviews under the IMF Staff-Monitored Program and the first review o f the Poverty&#13;
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program. Monetary policy has been restrained, supported by the&#13;
adherence to strong fiscal discipline and a no-overdraft rule that prohibits Central Bank financing o f the&#13;
deficit. Inflation i s decelerating with year-on-year inflation declining to 5.2 percent in September 2006&#13;
(compared to 16percent in2004/05).&#13;
&#13;
4.    Despite the solid economic recovery and sound macroeconomicpolicies,progress in development&#13;
remains patchy across the country. Continued security problems are encountered almost daily by the&#13;
Afghan population and by aid workers. Sustaining gains in development outcomes, particularly in health&#13;
and education, i s challengmg in this regard gwen the inability o f government and donor agencies to&#13;
access various communities.        The opium economy, accounting for around a quarter o f total (drug-&#13;
inclusive) GDP, remains Afghanistan's leading economic activity, and a key contributor to insecurity,&#13;
undermining the institution-building process, and distorting economic activity. As more donor resources&#13;
come on to the core budget    - akey objective o f Government - there are pressures on government agencies&#13;
to quickly deliver results on the ground, requiring significant increases in management and&#13;
implementation capacity. Inthe context of enormous needs, weak capacity and increasing insecurity in&#13;
many areas, a sense o f frustration is emerging at the ability o f the government to make public institutions&#13;
relevant to the lives o f ordinary Afghans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. GovernmentPublicAdministrationReformFramework&#13;
&#13;
5.    The Government's Public Administration Reform (PAR) Framework, as reflected in Afghanistan's&#13;
Interim National Development Strategy (I-ANDS)l has as its goal the establishment o f strong state&#13;
institutions at central and subnational levels capable of achieving measurable improvements in the&#13;
delivery o f services and the protection o f rights of all Afghans. The PAR Framework flows from the I-&#13;
ANDs which envisions a well functioningand affordable administration that is small and focused on core&#13;
functions. It's elements can be summarized as:&#13;
&#13;
         Establishing a well-performing, merit-based civil service;&#13;
         Strengthening the structure o f Government: line ministries and sub-national administration; and&#13;
     0   Buildinginstitutions o fpublic accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.    PAR i s necessarily a long term agenda, requiring sustained changes in institutional and individual&#13;
n o m s and behavior. Nevertheless, the Government has responsibility to achieve the benchmarks for&#13;
PAR set under the Afghanistan Compact (Box 1) and demonstrate specific results by the end o f 2010.&#13;
The PAR Framework is intended to guide and coordinate the Government and development partner&#13;
interventions duringthe rest o fthe Compact period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Box 1: Afghanistan Compact Benchmarks for Public Administration Reform&#13;
&#13;
          2.1.1   By 1389 (end-2010): Government machinery (including the number o f ministries) will be&#13;
          restructured and rationalized to ensure a fiscally sustainable public administration; the civil service&#13;
          commission will be strengthened; and civil service functions will be reformed to reflect core&#13;
          functions and responsibilities.&#13;
          2.1.2 A clear and transparent national appointments mechanism will be established within6 months,&#13;
          applied within 12 months, and fully implemented within 24 months for all senior level appointments&#13;
          to the central government and the judiciary, as well as for provincial governors, chiefs o f police,&#13;
          district administrators and provincial heads o f security.&#13;
&#13;
          2.1.3 By end-2006, a review o f the number o f administrative units and their boundaries will be&#13;
          undertakenwith the aim o f contributing to fiscal sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
          2.1.4 By end-2006, in furtherance o f the work of the civil service commission, merit-based&#13;
          appointments, vetting procedures and performance-based reviews will be undertaken for civil service&#13;
          positions at all levels o f government, including central government, the judiciary and police, and&#13;
          requisite support will be provided to build the capacity o f the civil service to function effectively.&#13;
          Annual performance-based reviews will be undertaken for all senior staff (Grade 2 and above)&#13;
          starting by end-2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.    To date PAR efforts have mainly focused on establishing a well-performing, merit-based civil&#13;
service, under the leadership o f the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission&#13;
(IARCSC). Buildinga capable civil service will continue to be the major thrust o f the PAR Framework;&#13;
but good service delivery requires more than competent civil servants. The structures o f many&#13;
Government organizations that employ these officials have become informal and need updatingto be able&#13;
to respond to the functions that these organizations are meant to deliver. Meanwhile, interactions between&#13;
central ministriesand sub-national administration are sometimes weak, thus raising the need to examine if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
`The Government completed its Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy (I-ANDs)andpresented it,&#13;
together with the Afghanistan Compact to the international community inBerlin inJanuary 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
more functions can be delegated to provincial and district governments. Thus the second element of the&#13;
Framework will be to strengthenline ministries and sub-national administration.&#13;
&#13;
8.    Taken together, these two elements will produce an effective civil service workmg within an&#13;
efficient Government structure, but is still missing a critical piece: the Government's accountability to its&#13;
citizens. Some o f the checks and balances on government will come from the National Assembly and&#13;
from the judiciary. The public and media will also have a role inmonitoring Government's performance&#13;
and holding it accountable. Thus, building institutions of public accountability is the third element of&#13;
thePAR Framework.&#13;
&#13;
C. AchievementsinCivilService ManagementandRemainingAgenda for Reform.&#13;
&#13;
9.    Continuingreforms and capacity buildingwithin the civil service i s at the core o f the Government's&#13;
Public Administration Reform Framework. The Government has made considerable progress over the&#13;
last 5 years inputtinginplace the basis for a modem civil service inAfghanistan (Table 1below). This&#13;
has included: (i)the establishment o f the IARCSC through the IARCSC Decree and the&#13;
operationalization o f its departments; (ii) approval o f a new Civil Service Law; (iii)some progress in&#13;
functional audits leading to proposals for new structures o f key ministries and agencies at the central level&#13;
- through the Priority Reform and Restructuring; (iv) initial policy work on a new pay and grade&#13;
structure; (v) progress on the development o f a new methodology and framework for reform and&#13;
restructuring; and, (vi) progress inmerit based recruitment for both senior andjunior level civil servants.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Critical to the government's early reform strategy was the Priority Reform and Restructuring&#13;
(PRR) program, begun in 2003. PRR enabled the staff o f ministries/agencies, or those in selected&#13;
departments undertahng particular key functions, to be placed on an interim additional allowance for a&#13;
fixed term inreturn for undertahng a reform and restructuring process. The initial objective o f the PRR&#13;
was to restore administrative capacity in key departments based on the combination o f (i)careful&#13;
restructuring o f such units including revisions o f organizational structure and job descriptions (ii)&#13;
selection o f key staff through an open and competitive process, and (iii) increases through an interim&#13;
                                                                            pay&#13;
allowance system so as to attract qualified staff into government. PRR was considered an interim&#13;
measure to prepare the way for the introduction o f a new grade and pay structure for the civil service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   Oversight o f PAR       Cabinet Sub Committee andPAR Steering Committee established.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.      Inorder to build upon this experience and strengthen the performance of the civil service, the&#13;
Government recognizes that it will have to address a number o f organizational and systemic capacity&#13;
constraints relatedto civil service management.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Incomplete Reorganization o f Line Ministries.           Progress has been made in many ministries,&#13;
under PRR, inputting inplace a basic revised structure for their organization and undertakmg some merit&#13;
based recruitment. This work, however, i s incomplete. As a result o f a lack o f time, insufficient internal&#13;
capacity and technical assistance, many PRR proposals lacked proper strategic analysis o f missions and&#13;
functions particularly in relation to their overall service delivery objectives. Although a "whole of&#13;
ministry" approach was adopted around November 2004, restructuring of functions did not allow for all&#13;
departments to work as an integrated whole, especially those located at provincial and district levels.&#13;
Inadequate attention to the establishment o f HR departments undermined effective recruitment since&#13;
staffing plans that specified numbers, job descriptions, grade-levels and qualifications o f staff needed in&#13;
new structures, were not sufficiently finalized. Proposals did not specify any monitorable indicators -&#13;
either o f process or outcomes, and once proposals were prepared most ministries lacked the capability or&#13;
resources to actually implement reforms.&#13;
&#13;
13.      The Government i s now revising its administrative reform framework to take account o f the&#13;
lessons learned under PRR shifting the focus away from previous asymmetric and department-centered&#13;
reforms to more comprehensive reforms involving entire ministries (centre to sub-national) with a&#13;
stronger focus on monitoring service delivery results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14.     Comuleting the Regulatory Framework for Sound Civil Service Management. The Civil Service&#13;
Law, approved by Cabinet in August 2005, outlines the structure and functions o f the IARCSC and&#13;
provides the basic law covering the organization o f the Afghan civil service. It also lays the foundation&#13;
for a merit-based and professionally managed civil service.         Within this legal structure, technical&#13;
assistance funded by the ADB and from IDA'SEPAP I1supported the drafting of priority regulations&#13;
including Appointments and Appeals Regulations, Performance Appraisal and Pay &amp; Grading&#13;
Regulations. Remaining regulations now need to be drafted including on job classification, promotions,&#13;
redeployment and retrenchment, attendance, contract employees, pensions, and termination, to complete&#13;
the regulatory environment for the management of civil servants. Ultimately all o f these regulations and&#13;
the procedures for applying themneedto be collatedinan integrated HR operations manual, and HR staff&#13;
ineach agency o fthe public sector needsto betrained to apply this "manual".&#13;
&#13;
15.     Inadequate Human Resource Management Capacity in Line Ministries. The implementation o f&#13;
key HR policies and procedures i s dependent on the effective dissemination o f these policies to qualified&#13;
staff located in reasonably functioning HR units within line ministries. HR units in Ministries and&#13;
government agencies have been primarily concerned with personnel administration and record keeping.&#13;
The Civil Service L a w now requires Ministries, agencies, provincial and district offices to assume the full&#13;
range o fhumanresources functions, includingthe collection o f critical employee information. Assistance&#13;
under EPAP I1set out a theoretical organizational structure for HR units within line ministries and a&#13;
training schedule in all aspects o f HRpolicies, procedure and regulations for the estimated 1025 HR staff&#13;
plusapproximately 1000line managers across the civil service.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Building Credibility o f the Merit Based Pnnciple in Appointments. Merit based appointments,&#13;
along with a fair and reliable arbitration mechanism, is the cornerstone o f the government's civil service&#13;
reform strategy.    In Afghanistan, the Appointments Board (AB) is responsible for ensuring that&#13;
appointments are made according to open, merit-based and competitive principles, as set out in the Civil&#13;
Service Law and for making senior appointments (Grade Two and above). The AB has made significant&#13;
progress towards establishing a merit based appointments system. To a large extent, there i s fair and open&#13;
competition with appointments made on merit. Nevertheless, the gains made are fragile and there i s a&#13;
need to address a widely held perception that the process for senior appointments i s unfair or even&#13;
corrupt. There i s also a need to shift focus from quantitative targets to the quality and transparency of&#13;
appointments. Under EPAP 11a plan for improving the qualitative and quantitative performance o f the&#13;
AB was prepared.      In addition, as part of IDA'Swork program on anti corruption, a vulnerability&#13;
assessment was conducted o f merit based appointments. As a result, the AB has adopted an action plan to&#13;
improve the quality and transparency o f the various stages o f the appointments process as well as address&#13;
weaknesses and vulnerabilities.&#13;
&#13;
17.     Poor Pay and Incentives for Recruitment, Retention Performance o f Staff. Implementation o f a&#13;
new pay and grade policy to replace the ad hoc utilization o f interim additional allowances under PRR i s&#13;
crucial to the Government's efforts to attract and retain qualified staff and to reduce incentives for&#13;
corruption within the civil service. With support funded under EPAP 11, an 8-grade structure has been&#13;
designed. New pay scales attached to these grades (with a minimumsalary o f $80 and maximum o f $800)&#13;
are being discussed by Cabinet, along with a sequenced implementationplan involving regrading senior&#13;
positions (Grades 1 and 2) first, followed by junior grades on a ministry-by-ministry basis.&#13;
Complementary policies and processes for severance, early retirement, and pensions linked to the P&amp;G&#13;
policy would be developed. Suitable good governance processes and safeguards would be built into the&#13;
reform for the implementationo fthe new P&amp;G system.&#13;
&#13;
18.     MonitorinP and Oversight.        The capacity o f the IARCSC to manage and facilitate the&#13;
implementation o f critical civil service reforms has steadily increased since its establishment in June&#13;
2003, but remains weak. Inparticular its capacity to provide strategic oversight, coordinate and monitor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the civil service reform program and to implement corrective measures in a timely manner needs to be&#13;
improved.    Broader government oversight also suffered when the Ministerial Advisory Committee&#13;
(MAC) was disbandedinAugust 2005. The Government has adopted a set o fmonitorable indicators for&#13;
the civil service reform effort, inline with the I-ANDs Benchmarks, and the IARCSC i s strengthening its&#13;
capacity to undertake monitoring and communicating against these benchmarks. In addition, a recently&#13;
establishedPAR Steering Committee will provide greater oversight o fthe various PAR initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
D. Government Strategy&#13;
&#13;
19.      Building on experiences over the last 5 years, and taking into account the remaining reform&#13;
agenda, the IARCSC has now prepared a costed Civil Service Implementation Plan - including actions&#13;
required and related timeline - for achieving the relevant PAR benchmarks of the Afghanistan Compact&#13;
over the remaining timeframe (20 10).&#13;
&#13;
20.      The cost o fthe ImplementationPlan i s baseduponthose elements inthe PAR Framework that are&#13;
well advanced inpreparation -particularly inthe area o f establishing a well performing merit based civil&#13;
service and strengthening the structures o f line ministries. As other elements o f the PAR Framework are&#13;
developed the overall reform implementationplan and costing will be updated. The investments required&#13;
to implement this plan have been costed at approximately $80.7 million over three years2. Together with&#13;
the set o f actionable and monitorable indicators that have been agreed with Government, this Plan&#13;
constitutes a realistic path for bringingabout some changes incivil service management and performance,&#13;
and trachng progress along the way.&#13;
&#13;
21.      Donors are now coming to agreement to align their support to civil service reform, to the&#13;
Government's program as reflected inthe PAR framework, the costed ImplementationPlan, andthe set of&#13;
monitorable indicators. Some donors have expressed a preference for channeling support to the reform&#13;
program through the World Bank-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund(ARTF).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
A. Bank's InterimStrategy&#13;
&#13;
22.      The proposed project directly underpins the objectives o f the World Bank's updated Interim&#13;
Strategy Note (ISN) 2006 for Afghanistan. Enhanced capacity and accountability within government are&#13;
critical to achieving development outcomes. "Developing the capacity of the state" is one o f the two&#13;
broad overlapping objectives set out in the ISN, with specific attention to developing human (education,&#13;
civil service etc) and financial capacity. Most specifically, under the broad state building theme, the&#13;
Bank's I S N focuses attention on achieving results under three strategic pillars one o f which is to: Build&#13;
the capacity of the state and its accountability to its citizens to ensure theprovision of services that are&#13;
affordable, accessibleand of adequate quality.&#13;
&#13;
23.      This project makes a specific contribution to the broader state building agenda which is at the&#13;
heart of the ISN, through continuing systemic administrative reforms withm the civil service and&#13;
strengthening the humanresource management capacity o f Government.&#13;
&#13;

B. IDA'SPreviousInvolvementinPublicAdministration Reform&#13;
&#13;
24.    IDA has supported a series o f projects (Table 2) aiming to buildcapacity within government in&#13;
key common functions, namely financial management, procurement, audit and human resource&#13;
management. These areaswere considered essential to demonstrate government capacity to manage donor&#13;
resources effectively for reconstruction purposes.&#13;

&#13;
25.    Early assistance focused on the provision o f emergency capacity in critical fiduciary areas.&#13;
Because o f the emergency nature o f this assistance, broader institutional development and capacity&#13;
buildingactivities didnot proceedas quickly as expectations grew inthisregard.&#13;
&#13;
26.    The Second Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP 11) also provided funds for the&#13;
government's emerging Public Administration Reform program. The purpose was to lay the basis for&#13;
broad based civil service reform directed at increasing the efficiency with which services are delivered to&#13;
the public. These funds supported activities to strengthen the core functions o f the IARCSC to support&#13;
the Pnority Reform and Restructuring process (PRR) and other critical activities in the PAR program,&#13;
including laying out the legislative agenda and strengthening merit based appointments procedures.&#13;

       The government will needto engage external advisers inkey fiduciary areas for as long as it takes&#13;
       to buildsufficient capacity incore public administration areas even ifthose advisers become&#13;

&#13;
C. Rationalefor IDA's InvolvementinPublicAdministration&#13;
&#13;
28.     Public administration reform is essential to rebuilding the state, institutionalizing improved&#13;
governance and combating, what is perceived to be, a growing corruption problem.            Strengthening&#13;
administrative capacity within government directly underpins the government's I-ANDs,promotes use o f&#13;
government systems over time and more specifically supports effective management o f IDA's portfolio.&#13;
Without a medium term strategy to buildcore capacities inline ministries, Afghanistan is likely to remain&#13;
dependent on international technical assistance and/or donor funds flowing outside the government's core&#13;
budget for some time.&#13;
&#13;
29.     The proposed project is one element o f a wider public administration reform agenda that has been&#13;
developed by the government, with IDA support, to address these medium term issues.&#13;
&#13;
   0    IDA'Sanalytical work is assisting the Government to define priorities and programs in Public&#13;
       Administration Reform. This will include work on: the evolution o f subnational governance&#13;
        over time, and strengtheninginstitutions o f accountability.&#13;
        As part o f defining work programs under this broader PAR framework, IDA has assisted the&#13;
        government in defining a realistic implementationplan for undertaking civil service reforms in&#13;
        line with compact benchmarks.&#13;
   0    IDA, with other donor support, is assisting the government develop its anticorruption strategy&#13;
        and identifying opportunities to limit the vulnerability to corruption, including in public&#13;
        administration reform;&#13;
        The IDA Programmatic Supportfor Institution Building (Box 2) series o f Development Policy&#13;
        Loans supports the achievement o f critical reforms in public financial management and public&#13;
        administration reform;&#13;
   0    A proposed IDA Public Financial Management Reform project is being agreed to support the&#13;
        strengthening o f financial management, procurement and audit practices throughout government;&#13;
        The ARTF financed Management Capacity Program i s supporting the interim buying-in o f&#13;
        Afghan consultants into civil service positions to manage core common function departments&#13;
        while broader capacity buildingefforts take hold.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     8&#13;

I                                           Box 2: Linkage with PSIB Series&#13;
&#13;
 Institution-building i s at the core o f the objectives o f the PSIBs and significant achievements have been made&#13;
 under PSIB Iand 11, which are fiuther advanced inthe proposed PSIB 111.The program supports improvements in&#13;
 the public resource management legal framework; specifically civil service, procurement and financial&#13;
 management laws were enacted. The PSIB series specifically supported the gazetting o f the Civil Service Law, a&#13;
 Code o f Conduct for government beneficiaries and approval o f the PRR decree. Beyond the change in the&#13;
 regulatory framework, the program supported reforms in organizational restructuring, merit based appointments,&#13;
 budget management processes and budget execution.&#13;
&#13;
 A prior action for PSIB I11is the adoption by the PAR Steering Committee o f a costed implementation plan for&#13;
 civil service reforms, along with an actionable monitoring framework. The plan reflects priorities within the&#13;
 Government's PAR Framework and five pillar strategy as prepared inNovember 2005. Inaddition, the adoption&#13;
 o f an Action Planto approve the performance o f the Civil Service Appointments Boardis a further PSIBIII trigger.&#13;
&#13;
 The CSR project will directly support the enhancement o f these institutional reforms by taking forward the work&#13;
 on the regulatory framework, especially inpay and grading, the application o f merit based recruitment principles&#13;
 through the Appointment Boards Action plan, and the monitoring and evaluation required to ensure results are&#13;
 achieved from donor investments inthe Government's Implementation Plan&#13;
&#13;
30.       The IDA Civil Service Reformproject complements the above activities by strengthening human&#13;
resource management practices throughout government - through addressing the regulatory framework,&#13;
organizational basis and capacity buildingneeds surrounding better management o f personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      111. THE PROPOSEDPROJECT&#13;
&#13;
A. Project Objective&#13;
&#13;
31.       The proposed IDA CSR project supports the implementation o f critical interventions in the&#13;
Government's PAR Framework and Civil Service ImplementationPlan. The project builds on the lessons&#13;
learned from earlier involvement in public administration reform in Afghanistan and elsewhere.&#13;
Specifically, the project recognizes that sustaining reforms in public administration, and particularly as&#13;
they relate to public sector employment practices, takes time. Reforms need to be flexible to wider&#13;
decision-malung on the role o f the state and attitudes concerning the nature o fpublic service.&#13;
&#13;
32.       With this focus, the main development objective for this project i s that across the time frame o f&#13;
the project, (by 2011), a significant proportion o f service delivery ministries will be performing their&#13;
functions to an acceptable level and can be held accountable for the use of public resources. This will&#13;
have resulted from core ministries having been reorganized according to functions and civil servants&#13;
being managed according to clear rules and procedures.&#13;
&#13;
33.       Indicators o f the progress inmeetingthe development objective would include, among others,&#13;
&#13;
                     The number of service delivery ministriesthat are reporting on progress toward&#13;
                     achieving their sectoral objectives, and the use o fresources for those purposes.&#13;
                     The proportion o f civil service appointments based on merit, and the rigor o fthe merit-&#13;
                     based appointments process.&#13;
                     The consistency o f application o f the Civil Service Law and regulations to the&#13;
                     management o f civil servants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             0      The extent to which LARCSC i s coordinating donor support for civil service reform,&#13;
                    and monitoring and reportingo fthe approved civil service reformimplementationplan&#13;
&#13;
34.      The proposed IDA project has been prepared in line with the Government's implementationplan&#13;
and complementary to expected support from other donors.                 Some o f the activities within the&#13;
Government's implementation plan, and within the proposed IDA project, could be scaled up as further&#13;
fundingbecomes available from the ARTF or other donors.&#13;
&#13;
B. ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
35.      The project is comprised o f three components designed to strengthen civil service organization&#13;
and management, including: organizational reforms in line ministries; merit based human resource&#13;
management policies andpractices; and PAR Oversight and Monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
36.      T h s i s primarily a technical assistance project. Attracting quality technical assistance to&#13;
Afghanistan has been a costly and mixed experience. There are several lessons learned for going forward.&#13;
&#13;
    0    Combining international specialists with nationaljunior specialists who can conduct day to day&#13;
         liaison with counterpart civil servants (and reduce requirement for long term advisers);&#13;
    0    Physically locating all specialists (international and national) with civil servant counterparts;&#13;
    0    Utilizing the Program Coordination Department to ensure coordination o f technical assistance&#13;
         activities under the project;&#13;
    0    Ensuringdedicated counterparts are identified - even if recruited in the short term through the&#13;
         Management Capacity Program;&#13;
    0    Ensuring TOR and work plans for technical advisers - both national and international -&#13;
         emphasize the importance o f capacity transfer;&#13;
    0    High-level technical oversight and monitoring o f TA outputs, including capacity transfer, to be&#13;
         reviewed quarterly by the PAR Steering Committee&#13;
&#13;
i. COMPONENT1.ORGANIZATIONALREFORMSWITHINCOREMINISTRIES.                              ($8.4 MILLION)&#13;
&#13;
37.      This component will provide support to a number o f core ministries to improve service delivery&#13;
throughrestructuring organization to meet functions; directed by a ministry-determinedprocess.&#13;
&#13;
38.      This will support the Compact benchmark 2.1.1 By end-2010 the Government machinery will be&#13;
restructured and rationalized to ensure a fiscally sustainable public administration; ..... civil service&#13;
functions will be reformed to reflect corefunctions and responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
39.      Activities taken up under this component will result in a number o f core ministries being able to&#13;
perform their sector specific functions more effectively, and with greater transparency for the use of&#13;
public resources. More specifically assistance will be providedto the following two subcomponents.&#13;
&#13;
(a)      Line Ministry Reorganization. Buildingon the experiences under PRR, the project will provide&#13;
technical assistance, training and limited equipment support to core ministries as they take charge o f their&#13;
own reorganization efforts. At the end o f the project period, line ministries, whose reorganization has&#13;
been supported by this Component, will be functioning systematically according to their own work&#13;
programs, instead o f undertaking ad hoc activities responding to donor demands. They will be able to&#13;
justify to Cabinet and Parliament the use o f public and donor resources. Some o f the steps towards this&#13;
end will be:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Preparing the ministry's three year strategic program including articulating the specific sectoral&#13;
        deliverables and means o fmonitoring;&#13;
        Consolidating results o f PRR and completing the restructuring o f non PRR'd departments&#13;
        including at subnational levels;&#13;
        Recruiting staff corresponding to the new structure and applying enhanced HR policies and&#13;
        procedures to the ministryas a whole -includingnew grade structures;&#13;
        Identifying funding gaps inthe ministry'sstrategic planand coordinatingdonor support for those;&#13;
        Producing an annual performance report for Cabinet and Parliament that specifies progress in&#13;
         achievingresults.&#13;
&#13;
40.      While ministryrestructuring will address core technical service functions, establishing common&#13;
functions such as finance, administration, and human resource management, i s equally important. Each&#13;
ministrymay set upa ReformImplementationManagement Unit(RIMU)to leadits restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Determination o f which ministies are supported under the project will be finalized in&#13;
consultation with the Government, (through the PAR Steering Committee) according to agreed criteria.&#13;
These criteria are likely to include: relative importance o f the ministry's work in terms o f service&#13;
delivery and national interest; leverage over financial and humanresources; commitment to undertakmga&#13;
real reform demonstrated by, progress already made under PRR; existence of a clear vision; some&#13;
monitoring o f performance/results; and, intent to invest (with donor support) in a major reform o f its&#13;
technical or service delivery activities. Under this grant, 4-5 ministries should be able to be supported.&#13;
 Support for other ministries would be provided by other donors andor ARTF in line with guidance&#13;
providedby the IARCSC. (Estimated Cost $7.Im)&#13;
&#13;
 (b)    IARCSC Facilitation and Coordination, The component will support technical assistance and&#13;
capacity building for the IARCSC to facilitate reforms across line ministries, ensuring consistency in&#13;
approach. This will involve developing common re-organization templates and best practice guidance,&#13;
and coordinating the efforts in selected ministries. It is expected that the IARCSC would enter into an&#13;
agreement with the relevant ministrywhich would specify the resources to be provided and the results the&#13;
ministryexpected to achieve with those resources. The emphasis will be on the IARCSC facilitation and&#13;
coordination o f reforms, not implementing the reforms themselves.            The PAR Implementation&#13;
Department o f the IARCSC will be supported with technical assistance to guide this program to sufficient&#13;
 standards. (Estimated cost $1.3m)&#13;
&#13;
ii. COMPONENT2.IMPLEMENTATIONOFMERIT                 BASEDHUMAN     RESOURCEMANAGEMENT&#13;
REFORMSINGOVERNMENT             ($8.7 MILLION)&#13;
&#13;
42.      This component will support the establishment and implementation across government o f modem&#13;
merit based HRpolicies and practices.&#13;
&#13;
43.      It will specifically support achievement o f Compact Benchmark 2.1.4:By end-2010, in&#13;
furtherance of the work of the civil service commission, merit-based appointments, vetting procedures&#13;
andperformance-based reviews will be undertakenfor civil servicepositions at all levels of government,&#13;
including central government ... Annual peflormance-based reviews will be undertaken for all senior&#13;
staff(grade 2 and above) starting by end-2007&#13;
&#13;
44.     As a result o f activities supportedunderthis component, a critical mass o fthe civil service will be&#13;
managed, predictably and consistently, according to updated civil service management rules and&#13;
procedures. This will have resulted from implementing a modem grading structure and pay levels; merit-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
based appointments and vetting procedures undertaken across the civil service; annual performance-based&#13;
reviews undertaken for all senior staff; and training to implement the policies throughout government.&#13;
&#13;
45.     More specificallyassistance will be providedthrough three sub components:&#13;
&#13;
(a)     Establishing and extending HR policies and practices to line ministries. This will involve&#13;
preparation o f remaining regulations and development o f procedures under the civil service law.&#13;
Technical assistance will be providedto line ministries inthe establishment o f HR departments, including&#13;
their functions, size, job descriptions and competencies; and in the application o f new HR policies and&#13;
procedures. As this i s done, an extensive program o f training and mentoring will be provided for the&#13;
estimated 2000 HR staff and line managers in revised human resource management procedures. This&#13;
program o f training may be conducted inconjunctionwith the Civil Service Training Institute with a view&#13;
to malung HR Management a core module o f civil service training. Support will also be provided for&#13;
finalization o f a pension reform policy. Assistance will be provided to the Human Resources Policy&#13;
Department o fthe IARCSC to carry out this program to sufficient standards. (Estimated Cost $3.5m).&#13;
&#13;
(b)     Strengthening the Appointments Procedures, according to the agreed action plan, so that merit&#13;
based recruitment for senior positions proceeds according to publicly agreed standards and targets and so&#13;
that monitoring o f appointments at junior levels i s improved; and strengthen the Appeals Board'to ensure&#13;
effective conduct o f appeals, including those likely to arise fi-om the pay and grading reform. (Estimated&#13;
Cost $1.4m)&#13;
&#13;
(c)     Implementing the government's pay and grade reform in line with fiscal parameters and&#13;
ministry implementation readiness. This will involve: undertalung a sustained communications plan&#13;
(funded under component 3 o f this project) inorder to buildunderstanding o f the new reform; re-grading&#13;
senior management positions onto the new 8 grade structure; developing procedures and guidance for&#13;
regrading and reassessing level 3 and below positions, and supporting this in line ministries; and&#13;
oversight, quality control andmonitoring o fprocess. (Estimated Cost $3.8m)&#13;
&#13;
iii.COMPONENT3.OVERSIGHTANDMONITORINGTHEPARPROGRAM($3.3MILLION).&#13;
                                                        OF&#13;
&#13;
46.     This component o fthe project will support the IARCSC incarrying out its stewardship role under&#13;
the Civil Service Law to "lead, regulate, formulate and implement structure policies of the public&#13;
administration system" (Article 5).&#13;
&#13;
47.     As a result o f support provided under this project the Government should have in place a fully&#13;
funded, regularly monitored and well coordinated and communicated Civil Service Reform program.&#13;
Assistance under the project will support two related sub components.&#13;
&#13;
(a)     Program Coordination and Management.                 The PAR framework and Civil Service&#13;
Implementation Plan provide an opportunity for greater coordination o f donor support. The Program&#13;
Coordination Department (PCD) o f the IARCSC i s responsible for coordinating donor responses in&#13;
support o fthe Government's civil service reformprogram. Assistance will be provided to enable the PCD&#13;
to take charge o f coordinating donor investments around this agreed framework and implementation plan.&#13;
The PCD will be responsible for translating the priority needs o f Government into investment programs&#13;
that could be submitted to ARTF, or other sources, for funding. With respect to IDA and other donor&#13;
financed projects, the PCD would also ensure coordination across technical assistance providers as well&#13;
as adherence to grant agreements, identify bottlenecks interms o f implementation and suggest solutions.&#13;
The project will provide technical assistance inprogram management and donor relations in addition to&#13;
financial management and procurement to support these tasks. (Estimated Cost $1.6m)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)     Monitoring and Evaluation, and Communication. Strengthening monitoring o f outcomes o f&#13;
civil service reform efforts and reporting regularly to the executive, to Parliament and to the wider&#13;
community is critical for managing expectations and building support for such reforms. The government&#13;
has adopted a set of actionable indicators for monitoring progress in Afghanistan's civil service reform&#13;
program. These complement the ongoing monitoring o fbenchmarks under the I-ANDs.&#13;
&#13;
48.     The Administrative Reform Secretariat o f the IARCSC i s responsible for developing policy&#13;
relating to public administration reform, communicating this across government and to the public, and&#13;
monitoring the implementation o f administrative reform activities. Assistance will be provided to enable&#13;
the A R S to periodically monitor and evaluate progress on civil service reforms, identify lessons learned,&#13;
support informed decision makmg and identify areas where changes in direction are needed. It will also&#13;
support ARS' efforts in guiding line ministries with establishing clear monitoring indicators. The M&amp;E&#13;
outputs should be used to build a stronger understanding by political representatives and senior officials,&#13;
including the Office o f the President, o f the role o f PAR. Assistance will also be provided to conduct a&#13;
clear communication strategy and outreach program to policy makers and key stakeholders (Estimated&#13;
Cost $1.7m)&#13;
&#13;
49.     Cost Estimates. The cost estimated for each component is based upon the level o f work&#13;
estimated to be needed in specific areas and the expected effort required to complete certain tasks.&#13;
Experience under earlier operations has also provided a guide to unit rates on contracts.&#13;

          IV.    PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION AND OVERSIGHT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
A. ImplementationArrangements&#13;
&#13;
50.     The CSR project will be implemented over a period o f 48 months, under the following&#13;
arrangements&#13;
&#13;
Governanceand Management Structure&#13;
&#13;
5 1.    The project would be implemented under the authority o f the Independent Administrative Reform&#13;
and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC). The responsibility would be delegated to the Chairman o f the&#13;
IARCSC. Oversight o f the program would be provided by the PAR Steering Committee comprising&#13;
senior representatives o f the IARCSC, the Ministry o f Finance, the Office o f the President and other&#13;
ministries as required, to maintain focus on results, good communications and a consolidated view o f the&#13;
programand to discuss and recommend any necessary policy and regulatory improvements.&#13;
&#13;
52.     Coordinationo fthe various activities under the project would be the responsibility o f the Program&#13;
Coordination Department (PCD).        The specific role o f the PCD would be to plan, coordinate, and&#13;
monitor, in liaison with the Director General o f the Civil Service Management Department and the&#13;
Director o f the ARS, the overall project work program and the achievement o f its intended results. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
would be responsible for ensuring that all requirements under the grant agreement are met with regard to&#13;
timely reporting and progress monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
Specific ImplementationArrangementsfor Project Components&#13;
&#13;
53.     Each       responsible for implementing a component and sub-component would establish its own&#13;
daily implementation arrangements (and are further outlined in the annexes). The PCD Director would&#13;
convene periodic meetings o f these working level authorities to identify and resolve implementation&#13;
issues that were outside the scope o ftheir individual authorities.&#13;
&#13;
54.     The PCD would be the focal point for organizing procurement under the project although setting&#13;
technical specifications, terms o f reference and qualifications o f prospective contractors would be shared&#13;
with the relevant departments within IARCSC. With the relevant employing departments, which would&#13;
supervise the technical performance o f contractors, the PCD would also be the focal point for&#13;
administering these technical assistance contracts and for compiling and managing payments in liaison&#13;
with the Finance Department o f the IARCSC, accounting for disbursements o f project funds and for&#13;
conducting any subsequent component and sub-component procurement. The PCD would prepare project-&#13;
wide financial reporting from the project accounts maintained in the SDU and be responsible for&#13;
responding to project audits. They will work closely with the finance department inthis regard.&#13;
&#13;
55.     The PCD would also coordinate establishing priorities for selecting the line ministries to be&#13;
assisted under the promam, with guidance from the PAR Steering Committee. These assessments would&#13;
include a technical assessment (by the PAR Implementation Department and the HR Department) o f the&#13;
readiness o f the respective line ministry to undertake further restructuring activities, as well as an&#13;
assessmento f the value o f improving HR capacity inthe context o f the importance o f the ministry/agency&#13;
with regardto budget and staffmanagement responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
56.     Component 1 would be managed by the PAR Implementation Department o f the IARCSC.&#13;
Resources under this component, dedicated for line ministry reform would effectively be passed on to&#13;
selected line ministries through an agreement between the ministry and the IARCSC. This agreement&#13;
would set out the level o f resources and assistance that the project would provide to the ministry and the&#13;
results'expected from the ministry in return. Component 2 would be managed by the Human Resources&#13;
Policy Department o f the IARCSC.         Component 3 activities would effectively be managed by the&#13;
Administrative Reform Secretariat and the ProgramCoordination Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Coordination with Other Donors and the Public Financial ManagementProject&#13;
&#13;
57.     The project i s being closely coordinated with the efforts o f other donors. The Program&#13;
Coordination Department o f the IARCSC will facilitate coordination o f donor activities and investments&#13;
around the Civil Service Implementation Plan. In this regard, it will hold regular program reviews and&#13;
support the submission o f proposals for funding for additional activities to donors andor ARTF, as&#13;
required. It will also ensure coordination across technical assistance providers, and along with the A R S ,&#13;
consistency in approach. Several other donors such as EC, DfID, UNDP, USAID and ADB already have&#13;
funds committed to undertake organizational and institutional reforms within key line ministries, in line&#13;
with guidance developedunder this project.&#13;
&#13;
58.     The project will closely coordinate with the reforms under the PFM project.             Support for&#13;
reorganizing common functions within key line ministries and strengthening the application of HR&#13;
practices will directly support the efforts within the PFM project to transfer financial management and&#13;
procurement responsibilities steadily to lineministriesand agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ProcurementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
59.     With donor assistance, Afghanistan has made considerable efforts to establish the Legal and&#13;
Regulatory Framework for procurement during the last five years. A new Procurement Law, reflecting&#13;
best international practice in public procurement, was enacted in November 2005 replacing the earlier&#13;
Procurement Regulations. The Afghanistan Procurement Regulations and Procedures are awaiting&#13;
clearance from the Ministryo f Justice and the Cabinet o f Ministers. A Special Procurement Commission&#13;
will be operational inApril 2007, and will be responsible to review the contract award recommendations&#13;
for contracts exceeding US$ 500,000. A Manual o f Procedures for Procurement Appeal and Review has&#13;
been prepared and the system will begin to be operational by April 2007. Afghanistan specific&#13;
biddinglproposal documents will be prepared by December 2007. Bidding opportunities for all major&#13;
contracts and the contract awards are published on the ARDS website under the Ministry of Economy.&#13;
ARDS-PU i s currently issuing the bidding documents to all the potential bidders electronically free o f&#13;
charge. The above actions will increase the transparency and the confidence ofthe business community.&#13;
&#13;
60.     Much still needs to be completed to improve dissemination o f the new Law, Regulations,&#13;
Procedures and Appeals mechanism throughout government and with the business community. An IDA-&#13;
funded technical assistance project i s in place to carry out an intensive and extensive capacity building&#13;
program.    Action will be simultaneously taken to develop procurement proficient personnel in line&#13;
ministries, with an accreditation system. Inaddition, the Government i s seelung opportunities to get civil&#13;
society involved inproviding oversight inthe adherence to transparency inthe process.&#13;
&#13;
61.     Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (dated May 2004) and revised in October 2006.; "Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (dated M a y 2004)and revised in&#13;
October 2006.; and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement. The Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents, Requests for Proposals, and Forms o f Consultant Contract will be used. In case o f&#13;
conflictkontradictionbetween the Bank's procurement procedures and any national rules and regulations,&#13;
the Bank's procurementprocedureswill take precedence.&#13;
&#13;
62.     Most o f the procurement under the project will be for the provision o f technical assistance&#13;
through firmshndividuals. ARDS-PU will assist IARCSC to carry out procurement o f major consultancies&#13;
includinghighvalue individual assignments and all goods following ICB/NCB procedures. IARCSC will&#13;
provide technical inputsinpreparation o f TORs/specifications and take the lead in carrying out technical&#13;
evaluations. The Director (Finance and Administration) o f IARCSC will be responsible for procurement&#13;
o f small value goods contracts following Shopping and Direct Contracting procedures. A summary o f&#13;
procurement methods i s given in Annex IV. The Program Coordination Department (PCD) would be&#13;
responsible for contract administration, and with the user section, shall monitor compliance with terms o f&#13;
reference etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financia1Management Arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
63.     A Public Financial Management (PFM) performance rating system has recently been developed&#13;
for Afghanistan by the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency partnership&#13;
program, which includes the World Bank, IMF,EC, and other agencies. Afghanistan's ratings against the&#13;
PFM performance indicators portray a public sector where financial resources are, by and large, being&#13;
used for their intended purposes as authorized by a budget that i s processed with transparency and has&#13;
contributed to aggregate fiscal discipline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64.      Financial management and audit functions for the proposed project will be undertaken through&#13;
the agents contracted under the Public Administration Capacity Building project. This i s the primary&#13;
instrument for continuing to strengthen the fiduciary measures put inplace for ensuring transparency and&#13;
accountability o f funds provided by the Bank and other donors. Under these contracts, two advisers-&#13;
Financial Management and Audit-are        responsible for worhng with the government and line ministries&#13;
to carry out these core functions. The Financial Management Adviser (FMA) i s responsible for helping&#13;
the M o F maintain the accounts for all public expenditures, including IDA-financed projects and for&#13;
buildingcapacity within government offices for these functions.&#13;
&#13;
65.      At the project level, financial management will be coordinated by the Program Coordination&#13;
Department (PCD) o f the IARCSC, inliaisonwith the Finance Department o f the IARCSC.&#13;
&#13;
66.      A Financial Management Specialist will be recruited at the IARCSC with responsibility for&#13;
financial management activities o f the project, which will include processing o f consultants and suppliers&#13;
invoices for payments i.e. preparation o f M-16 forms (payment orders), maintaining relevant accounting&#13;
records, preparation o f required monthly, quarterly and annual reports, coordination with other&#13;
component implementing entities to ensure that adequate financial management requirements are met,&#13;
liaising with SDU to ensure that the Designated Account i s replenished as at when due andbe responsible&#13;
for responding to project audits.&#13;
&#13;
67.      Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be prepared by the IARCSC's accounting unit.&#13;
Consolidated project reports will be prepared, reviewed, and approved by the MoF, supported by the&#13;
FMA. A Designated Account (DA), will be opened at Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB, Central Bank). The&#13;
DA will be maintained by the MoF. Withdrawal applications for replenishment will be submitted&#13;
monthly. Financialmanagement arrangements for the project are detailed inAnnex V.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
68.      Fund Flows: Fund management for the Project will follow existing procedures. As with all&#13;
public expenditures, all payments under the project will be routed through MoF. The FM Adviser will&#13;
assist the M o F in executing and recording project payments. Inkeeping with current practices for other&#13;
projects inAfghanistan, the DA will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) inthe Treasury&#13;
Department, MoF. Requests for payments from DA funds will be made to the SDU by IARCSC. In&#13;
addition to payments from DA funds, IARCSC can also request the SDU to make direct payments to&#13;
consultants or consulting firms, and special commitments for contracts covered by letters o f credit. Such&#13;
requests will follow World Bank procedures.             All withdrawal applications to IDA, including&#13;
replenishment, reimbursement, and direct payment applications, will be prepared and submitted by MoF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
69.     Accounting and Reporting: A Financial Management Manual will be prepared by IARCSC&#13;
documenting the financial management arrangements for the project. The manual will outline guidelines&#13;
for project activities including specific requirements for each component implementing entity, and&#13;
establish a project financial management system inaccordance with standard Afghan government policies&#13;
and procedures. This will include use of the Chart o f Accounts developed by the Treasury to record&#13;
project expenditure. Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in MoF, through the SDU and&#13;
supported by the FMA. Consolidated Project Financial Statements will be prepared for all sources and&#13;
uses o fproject expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
70.     Disbursement Method: Disbursements from the IDA grant will be made in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Disbursement Handbook for World Bank Clients (May 2006)using advances, reimbursement,&#13;
direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments including records (source documentation) or&#13;
against reports (statements o f expenditures), as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
71.      The Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, i s responsible for auditing the accounts o f all&#13;
IDA-financed projects. Annual audited project financial statements will be submitted within six months&#13;
o fthe close o f GOA'Sfiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
B. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
72.      Responsibility for assuringthat the results o f the project are achieved would be vested inthe PAR&#13;
Steering Committee, which reports to the GOA on all matters related to the reform o f public&#13;
administration. The results framework including component-by-component progress benchmarks is given&#13;
inAnnex 11.&#13;
&#13;
73.      Operationally, the IARCSC has responsibility for developing monitoring and evaluations o f PAR&#13;
performance that would extend to the project results. It i s also responsible for providing the PAR Steering&#13;
Committee with diagnosis o f issues, analysis o f options for resolving them, and recommended courses o f&#13;
action. The IARCSC i s organized to perform this function through its Administration Reform Secretariat&#13;
(ARS) which reports to the Chairman o f the IARCSC. The ARS includes a Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Department that would conduct the daily work requiredto meet the IARCSC's responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
74.      The ARS/M&amp;E Department is adequately staffed in terms o f numbers and grades o f personnel,&#13;
and its mandate and lines of reporting are clear. It is, however, operationally weak and inexperienced. It&#13;
has received assistance in becoming familiar with the concepts and terminology o f monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and provided some ad hoc evaluations o f selected issues. It has not, however, conducted a&#13;
cross-agency exercise o f the type required by the current project (use o f a data collection instrument&#13;
designed to generate comparable data across agencies; collection and compilation o f other sources o f&#13;
administrative data and intelligence as part o f a "stock-talung; performing interpretation o f data against&#13;
expectations and rating results; drawing conclusions and presenting options for bridging gaps between&#13;
results and expectations).&#13;
&#13;
75.      The project itself would provide consultant services to work in the ARS/M&amp;E Department to&#13;
support three successive annual reviews o f this type. The residual would be templates, tested processes&#13;
and protocols that could be replicated.&#13;
&#13;
76.      The ARS/M&amp;E Department would also collaborate with the Human Resource Management&#13;
(HRM) Department and the PAR ImplementationDepartment to develop individual methodologies for&#13;
monitoring their specific results so that these can be readily employed for management as well as annual&#13;
results monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
C. Benefitsand Risks&#13;
&#13;
77.      The project will support the Government's efforts to build a solid foundation for a professional,&#13;
capable and results-oriented civil service. Successful implementation o f the project will provide greater&#13;
confidence to the Afghan public and donors that, over time, capacity can be built within Afghan&#13;
institutions to deliver results in an effective and accountable manner. The project, addresses specific&#13;
weaknesses in the overall management o f the civil service and aims to leverage funds where there i s&#13;
likely to be maximum retum interms o f management o f resources on the ground. There are significant&#13;
risksto the project as described below, and summarized inthe table at the bottom o f this section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78.         Thefragilepolitical environment i s a major risk factor which poses uncertainties with regardto&#13;
the ability o f government to stay on course with a difficult reform process. Public administration reform&#13;
i s inherently a long term process requiring not only changes in formal rules, but also cultural norms and&#13;
values, which are significantly harder to shift.      In Afghanistan, political commitment to the reform&#13;
process is weak and the overall context      -o f fluid political alliances - i s not particularly conducive to&#13;
successful reform. To partially address these risks, IDA i s assisting the government in further developing&#13;
its PAR framework which, among other things, will help strengthen accountability and broader&#13;
understanding ofthe needfor such reforms.&#13;
&#13;
79.         Weak oversight and uncoordinated donor behavior has at times undermined objectives. The&#13;
provision of assistance to the Public Administration Reform agenda has been uncoordinated and o f low&#13;
quality in the context o f poorly defined reform agendas and coordination mechanisms.                Since the&#13;
Ministerial Advisory Committee stopped meeting inAugust 2005, wider government oversight has been&#13;
l a c l n g - leading to a sense of vacuum and a perception that little o f substance i s talung place. Donors&#13;
and government are now coming to agreement on: a common framework for public administration&#13;
reform; a clear plan for implementing key civil service elements o f this framework; a set o f monitorable&#13;
indicators to show progress towards the Compact goals, and (eventually) the impact o freforms on service&#13;
delivery. These factors would provide the basis for a more programmatic allocation o f resources from&#13;
donors to support government inthis area, possibly funded through ARTF.&#13;
&#13;
80.        Some elements of the reform agenda are technically dqficult to undertake. Government has set&#13;
itself an ambitious timetable for rolling out a new pay and grade structure while wishing to preserve the&#13;
principles o f administrative reform and merit based appointments underpinning this. There i s a risk that,&#13;
without due attention to capacity, quality and supportive reforms in the areas o f pensions and severance,&#13;
these reforms could simply lead to a more expensive government with little improvements in service&#13;
delivery. To mitigate these risks, Government will (i)      carefully sequence reforms (starting with senior&#13;
levels, establishing first key management functions, and beginning with ministries with a proven capacity&#13;
to implement reform); and (ii)      monitor, evaluate, and communicate about the reform. There are few&#13;
technical alternatives at this point to addressing the need for a new pay and grade structure. The project&#13;
provides technical assistance to guide the process and minimize risks inthis regard.&#13;
&#13;
81.        Implementation capacity is weak. Capacity to manage a complex andpolitically sensitive reform&#13;
program i s severely limited. Both the IARCSC and line ministries ability to absorb and implement new&#13;
reforms i s limited. A review o f options for the evolution o f the IARCSC, in light o f its wide- ranging&#13;
responsibilities for policy, implementation and monitoring o f reforms, i s being undertaken. In addition,&#13;
the project will directly support the completion o freforms within the relevant departments inthe IARCSC&#13;
so they can satisfactorily perform their responsibilities. Other initiatives such as the Management&#13;
Capacity Program, will provide temporary implementationsupport inkey areas.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D. Grant ConditionsandCovenants&#13;
&#13;
82.      Standard requirements covering organization and staffing, management arrangements, provisions&#13;
for procurement and financial management will suffice. However, receipt by IDA o f evidence o f a Pay&#13;
and Grade Policy in form and substance satisfactory to IDA, would be a disbursement condition for Sub&#13;
component 2 (c) o f the Project, related to implementation o fthe Government's pay and grade policy.&#13;
&#13;
83.     Inaddition, IARCSC shall, byno later than 31August, 2007, engage the services ofa financial&#13;
management specialist under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association to be responsible for&#13;
overall financial management o f the Project. The IARCSC shall also prepare both an Operations Manual&#13;
and a FinancialManagement Manual, ina manner satisfactory to IDA, by 31August, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
84.     The International Development Association General Conditions for Credits and Grants", dated&#13;
July 1, 2005 (as amended through October 15, 2006) apply to the project. There are no effectiveness&#13;
conditions for the project. Standardeffectivenessrequirements under the General Conditions will apply.&#13;
&#13;
E. Environmentand Social Safeguards.&#13;
&#13;
86.     The Project has been assigned Category "C" for environment. No environmental impacts are&#13;
expectedto arise as a result o fProject implementation. The Project will not involve any acquisition o f&#13;
land or displacement o fpopulation.&#13;

                    ANNEX 111. DESCRIPTIONOF COMPONENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A. Descriptionof Component1:OrganizationalReformswithin CoreMinistries($8.4m).&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.    Structuring government organizations to follow their functions has been important in Afghanistan&#13;
because structures had become very informal during the conflict years. There was little clarity about the&#13;
functions o f ministries and agencies, and even less about their constituent units. Administrative practices&#13;
from different legal regimes coexisted, and ad hoc administrative changes had been introduced by some&#13;
ministries to deliver quick results. There was need to evaluate whether the staffing and supervision&#13;
structure was consistent with the level o f decision-making and each o f the ministry'sfunctions.&#13;
&#13;
Compacttarget andtimeline&#13;
&#13;
2.    On this subject the Compact states: By end-2010 the Government machinery will be restructured&#13;
and rationalized to ensure afiscally sustainable public administration; .....civil servicefunctions will be&#13;
reformed to reflect corefunctions and responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
Achievementsto date&#13;
&#13;
3.    The principle vehicle for restructuring and rationalizing individual government organizations has&#13;
been the Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) Program. Its objective was to stimulate modest,&#13;
targeted incremental reform o f key functions within government departments and agencies (World Bank,&#13;
2004). The PRR process allowed staff o f selected departments o f ministries or entire ministries to be&#13;
placedon an elevated pay scale for a fixed term in exchange for restructuring. PRR status was granted on&#13;
the basis o f the quality o f the proposed strategy and the implementation plan. Staff placed on PRR scale&#13;
hadto have demonstrated a track record o f competence and be recruited through a competitive process.&#13;
&#13;
4.    PRR enabled ministries to begin a basic reform process.            PRR Stage 2 proposals have been&#13;
approved for 24 o f 44 ministries/agencies (entire structure) and a further 8 out o f 44 have been partially&#13;
approved (for key departments) covering approximately 44,000 positions. Over 9000 o f these posts have&#13;
been filled utilizing competitive merit based procedures including more than 1500at senior levels.&#13;
&#13;
5.    This agenda, however, is incomplete. As a result o f a lack o ftime, insufficient internal capacity and&#13;
insufficient technical assistance, many PRR proposals lacked proper strategic analysis o f key missions&#13;
and functions o f ministries particularly inrelation to their overall service delivery objectives. Although a&#13;
"whole o f ministry" approach was adopted around November 2004, restructuring o f functions did not&#13;
allow for all departments to work as an integrated whole, including those located at provincial and district&#13;
levels. Inadequate attention to establishing HR departments, meant that recruitment to new positions was&#13;
not adequately undertaken inthe absence o f staffing plans that specified numbers, job descriptions, grade-&#13;
levels and qualifications o f staff needed in new structures. Proposals did not specify any monitorable&#13;
indicators - either o f process or outcomes, and once proposals were prepared most ministries lacked the&#13;
capability or resources to actually implement reforms.&#13;
&#13;
6.    The Government i s now revising its administrative reform framework to take account o f the lessons&#13;
learned under PRR shifting the focus away from previous asymmetric and department-centeredreforms to&#13;
more comprehensive refoms involving entire ministries (centre to sub-national) with a stronger focus on&#13;
monitoring service delivery results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Proposed Assistance.&#13;
&#13;
7.    The project will provide technical assistance, training and limited equipment to core ministries as&#13;
they take charge o f their own reorganization efforts. At the end o f the project period, line ministries,&#13;
whose reorganization has been supported by this Component, will be functioning systematically&#13;
according to their own work programs, instead o f undertalung ad hoc activities responding to donor&#13;
demands. They will be able tojustify to Cabinet and Parliament the use o fpublic and donor resources.&#13;
&#13;
8.    The project will support selected core ministries as they take charge o f their own reorganization&#13;
efforts ina post-PRR environment. A particular focus would be placedon improving the organization and&#13;
performance o f functions common to all public agencies (including administration, human resource&#13;
management, financial management and procurement, and ifrelevant, development and administration o f&#13;
regulations). With the assistance made available through the component, a typical recipient agency would&#13;
complete the following tasks, through their Reform ImplementationManagement Unit (RIMU).&#13;
&#13;
         Preparing the ministry's three year strategic program including articulating the specific sectoral&#13;
         deliverables and means o fmonitoring;&#13;
         Consolidating results o f PRR and completing the restructuring o f non PRR'd departments&#13;
         including at subnational levels;&#13;
         Recruiting staff corresponding to the new structure and applying enhanced HR policies and&#13;
         procedures to the ministryas a whole -includingnew grade structures;&#13;
         Identifying funding gaps inthe ministry's strategc plan and obtaining coordinated donor support&#13;
         for those;&#13;
         Producing an annual performance report for Cabinet and Parliament, that specifies progress in&#13;
         achieving results.&#13;
&#13;
9.    As a result of these activities, ministries or agencies would have developed a hospitable&#13;
organizational environment for absorbing specialist functional and sector-specific development&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Resources: The grant would finance:&#13;
&#13;
         Technical assistance to ministries and agencies for specific institutional and organizational&#13;
         improvements. This would be in the form o f a small team of international and locally recruited&#13;
         specialists with competencies in, (i)  organization o fpublic sector administration and management&#13;
         (ii)institutional development, (iii)  organization of human resource management departments. As&#13;
         organizational structures are developed, the nature o f the technical assistance may change with a&#13;
         need for more specialist inputs to identify service improvement opportunities. Some funds are&#13;
         available for supporting equipment and training. It i s expectedthat the average ministrywould be&#13;
         allocated up to 60 person months o f international technical assistance over a 36 month period and&#13;
         60 person months o fnationaltechnical assistance costing approximately $2.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
         The cost o f additional assistance to the IARCSC PAR Implementation Department to guide&#13;
         ministries and agencies, and to provide quality control and consistency between the restructuring&#13;
         efforts being carried out. Competencies would include organization o f public sector&#13;
         administration and management. It i s expected that up to 32 person months o f international and&#13;
         60 person months o f national technical assistance would be required. These experts may also&#13;
         assist smaller ministries as part o ftheir ministry-specific teams&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11.     Onthis basis, 4-5 ministries could be supported, depending on the level o f effort requiredineach&#13;
ministry. The specific ministries to be selected will be determined on the basis o f criteria agreed to&#13;
between IDA and the Government.&#13;

B. Descriptionof Component2. ImplementationofMeritBasedHumanResourceManagement&#13;
     PoliciesandPracticesinGovernment ($8.7 million)&#13;
&#13;
12.     The Civil Service Law, approved by Cabinet inAugust 2005, outlines the structure and functions&#13;
o f the IARCSC and provides the legal framework for a reformed, merit-based and professionally&#13;
managed Afghan civil service. Implementationo f the Civil Service Law i s central to the Government's&#13;
Interim National Development Strategy (I-ANDs) and Compact between the government and&#13;
international community. Benchmark 2.1.4, although ambitious, i s a target that both the Government and&#13;
International Community have collectively committedto achieving:&#13;
&#13;
        2.1.4: By end-2010, in furtherance of the work of the civil service commission, merit-based&#13;
        appointments, vetting procedures and peformance-based reviews will be undertaken for civil&#13;
        service positions at all levels of government, including central government ... Annual&#13;
        performance-based reviews will be undertakenfor all senior stafl(grade 2 and above) starting by&#13;
        end-2007&#13;
&#13;
13.     This component comprises three critical activities: (i)HR policies, procedures and training; (ii)&#13;
senior appointments andappeals; and (iii)   pay and grading reform.&#13;
&#13;
SUBCOMPONENT 2.1 HUMAN           RESOURCEPOLICIES,PROCEDURESAND TRAINING&#13;
&#13;
14.     Regulatory Framework. Technical assistance funded by the ADB and IDA'SSecond Emergency&#13;
Public Administration Project supported the Human Resources Policy Department (HRPD) to draft&#13;
priority regulations including Appointments Regulation, Appeals Regulation, Performance Appraisal&#13;
Regulation and Pay &amp; Grading Regulation. These draft regulations were based upon generally accepted&#13;
best practice inHR, alignedto meet Afghanistan's specific needs and conditions. They are currently under&#13;
review by an inter-ministerial committee and are expected to be finalized and submitted for Cabinet&#13;
approval by the end o f SY 1385 (21 March 2007).&#13;
&#13;
15.     Other key regulations, procedures, guidelines, forms etc also need to be drafted including on&#13;
vetting o f candidates, job classification, promotions, transfers, redeployment and retrenchment,&#13;
attendance, contract employees, pensions, and termination. Some will require further technical work and&#13;
policy decisions. Technical assistance will be providedunder the project to support:&#13;

          Establishment and implementation o f a simple monitoring mechanism to review progress on&#13;
          implementationo f key HR policies including at sub-national level.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Establishing and Extending HR Policies and Practices to Line Ministries. The implementation&#13;
o f key HR policies and procedures i s dependent on the effective dissemination o f these policies to&#13;
qualified staff located inreasonably functioning HR units within line ministries. HR units in Ministries&#13;
and government agencies have been primarily concerned with personnel administration and record&#13;
keeping, rather than the management o f human resources within a performance management framework.&#13;
The Civil Service Law requires Ministries, agencies, provincial and district offices to take on the full&#13;
range o f human resource management functions, including recruitment, job classification, performance&#13;
assessment inaddition to basic personnel management processes. A proposed organizational structure for&#13;
HRunits within line ministrieshas been developed alongwith a training schedule for the estimated 1025&#13;
HR staff expected to be needed, plusrelevant line managers, inall aspects o fHRpolicies, procedure and&#13;
regulations.&#13;
&#13;
17.     Assistance under this component will support the HRPD in finalizing a structure and related&#13;
staffing competencies for HR departments in ministries and agencies. Advice and guidance will be&#13;
provided to ministries and agencies on the establishment o f the new HR structure identifying where&#13;
further resources might be needed to support implementation. Once the new HR structure has been&#13;
established then related training on the new HR policies and procedures can be provided along with any&#13;
supporting equipment.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The earlier training needs assessment for HR staff o fministries and agencies will be updated with&#13;
assistance under this component, specifying the full program o f HRM training along with the proposed&#13;
training plan, location, methodology, calendar and budget. It will examine the possibilityo f utilizing the&#13;
Civil Service Training Institute in conducting the training and having HR management established as a&#13;
core module o f its program, with specified competencies determined for HRManagers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.     Once the Government has approved the training needs assessment, technical assistance under this&#13;
project will coordinate and oversee a sustained program o f training (in conjunction with the Civil Service&#13;
Training Institute if possible) for the estimated 1000 new HR managers that will be required and 1000&#13;
line managers. The earlier training needs assessment suggested a training schedule of 18 days - in six 3&#13;
day sessions across two years - would be required to cover all necessary procedures and standards under&#13;
the Law. The training needs assessment.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Information on civil servants. One o f the key tasks o f HR units in ministries should be the&#13;
collection and maintenance o f a consistent set o f information on employees that could ultimately be&#13;
centralized and linked to payroll. Bringing consistency into the methodology for collecting employee&#13;
informationi s becomingurgent inthe context o f implementation o f a new pay and grade reform.&#13;
&#13;
21.     IDA'SEPAPI1funded the design o f a simple M S Access database at the IARCSC to inputbasic&#13;
informationreceivedfrom ministries on current civil servants. However, information on employees is not&#13;
systematically received and remains inconsistent. A study i s currently being funded through a separate&#13;
IDA project to devise a new process to ensure consistency across government and provision o f the&#13;
requiredinformation centrally to IARCSC's Human Resource Policy Department (HRPD).&#13;
&#13;
22.     This project will provide limited assistance to the IARCSC to oversee the implementation o f this&#13;
new process. In parallel, the IARCSC will seek funding from other donors for development and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementation of a fully fledged IT system over time which would support and automate the&#13;
mechanisms o f HR management.&#13;
&#13;
23.       Pensions Reform. The pension system in Afghanistan faces serious financial and operational&#13;
challenges. Payments are made on an ad hoc basis largely from the central budget, records are paper-&#13;
based, information technology applications are non-existent, administrative capacity o f current staff i s&#13;
low and the overall operation is non-transparent. As the pension benefit i s directly related to the last&#13;
wage, the new pay and grading reform within the civil service may seriously impact outstanding pension&#13;
liabilities. Significant reforms are required for the establishment o f a modem pensions system. Analytical&#13;
work by the World Bank suggests the reformwill be limited largely to parametric changes inthe existing&#13;
provisions. Implementation o f the parametric reform, rationalization o f operations, and upgrading o f&#13;
infrastructure will require substantive resources and capacity. This project will support technical&#13;
assistance for up to 12 person months to finalize the pension policy parameters and an action plan to&#13;
implement a pensionreform and modernizationprogramthroughout government.&#13;
&#13;
24.       Strengthening of HRPD. The Human Resources Policy Department (HRPD) is responsible for&#13;
overseeing the development o f HRpolicies and facilitating their implementation across the Civil Service.&#13;
However, its capacity i s weak and it is unable to effectively fulfill its functions. A comprehensive&#13;
functional review under IDA'SEPAP IIwas carried out of the HRPD in February 2006 and provided&#13;
recommendations on structure, staffing and training. The report also highlighted the need for the&#13;
development o f a strategic business plan and individual performance targets with progress towards their&#13;
achievement evaluated on a frequent basis. The project will support the strengthening o f the HRPD in&#13;
order that it can lead on the critical humanresource management activities under its mandate.&#13;
&#13;
25.       In addition, it is important that improvements in HR capacity and practices are monitored and&#13;
reported on regularly. The project will support the development o f a benchmarking and monitoring&#13;
system that will permit the HRPD to verify that new HR systems and practices are being properly&#13;
implemented with due attention to reasonable standards set by the government.&#13;
&#13;
SUB-COMPONENT 2.2 SENIOR APPOINTMENTS AND APPEALS&#13;
&#13;
26.       Senior Appointments. Senior appointments based on merit i s one o f the Cornerstones o f the Civil&#13;
Service Reform program in Afghanistan and i s central to strengthening the managerial capacity of the&#13;
civil service. Inthis regard, an Appointments Board (AB)and an Appeals Board were established inmid-&#13;
2003. The Appointments Board identifies and recommends the recruitment, appointment, promotion,&#13;
transfer, retirements, pension payment and other personal matters o f high-ranking civil servants for the&#13;
approval o f the President and monitors the appointments in line ministries o f junior positions. The&#13;
Appeals Board i s responsible for hearing appeals fiom civil servants who consider they have been&#13;
disciplinedunfairly.&#13;
&#13;
27.       Appointments based on patronage, political influence and ethnic preferences were the general and&#13;
accepted way in which appointments were traditionally made to the Afghan civil service. Against this&#13;
backdrop, achievements in senior merit-based appointments have been significant. Over 1400 senior&#13;
appointments have been made and over 7200junior appointments have been monitored by the AB; senior&#13;
appointments are being made in line with set procedures; several training workshops have been held on&#13;
criteria-based assessment; and a system for weekly business reporting has been established.&#13;
&#13;
28.       There i s a concern regarding the fragility o f some o f the gains made. A World Bank-funded&#13;
independent assessment o f the senior appointments process was conducted in December 2006. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recommends that greater emphasis now be placed on the quality o f the assessmentprocess rather than the&#13;
number o f appointments made. In addition, as part o f IDA'S work program on anti corruption, a&#13;
vulnerability assessment was conducted o f merit based appointments. In line with the recommendations&#13;
arising from these two reviews, the AB has adopted a comprehensive action plan to buildon the progress&#13;
to date which it intends to implement over the next three years. Specific improvements relate to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0    Robust andtransparent procedures at all stages o fthe appointments;&#13;
     0    On the job mentoring and specific training for AB staff e.g. on interview techniques, criteria-&#13;
          based selection, etc;&#13;
     0    Establishment o f an internal monitoring mechanism to allow quantitative and qualitative review&#13;
          o f processes and outcomes inmerit-based appointments;&#13;
          Implementationo f a country-wide communication campaign.&#13;
&#13;
29.      Improvements in the appointments process are a high priority for the IARCSC. This i s&#13;
particularly the case gven the backlog it faces in appointments o f around 840 positions and the expected&#13;
increase o f senior appointments in line with implementation o f pay and grade reform. Technical&#13;
assistance under the project will support:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0     Implementation o f AB'S Action Plan to improve processes, outcomes and monitoring o f&#13;
           appointments;&#13;
     0     Development and implementation o f measures to encourage gender equality and ethnic balance&#13;
           inthe senior civilservice;&#13;
     0     Development and delivery o f a `continuous learning' program for Commissioners,&#13;
           Establishment o f internal monitoring mechanisms (for quantitative and qualitative evaluation o f&#13;
           process and outcome o fmerit-based appointments).&#13;
&#13;
30.     Appeals. Since the establishment o f the Appeals Board in mid-2003, procedures have been&#13;
developed and are being implemented and the Board has received and successfully dealt with 279&#13;
appeals. It appears to function well. However, little external assistance has been provided to support the&#13;
Appeals Board and there i s a need to review these procedures and introduce simple appeals mechanisms&#13;
at Ministry level given that the expected increase in gnevances with the progressive implementation o f&#13;
pay and grading reform. Technical assistance will support:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0     Development and implementation o f a performance improvement plan for the Appeals Board&#13;
           and appeals process throughout government, setting specific service standards with regard to&#13;
           timeliness and customer satisfaction;&#13;
     0     Introduction of a simple appeals mechanism (including structure and guidelines) in individual&#13;
           ministriesand agencies, and regionalIARCSC offices;&#13;
     0     A simple monitoringmechanism for appeals settled at ministryand sub-national levels;&#13;
     0     Reporting (preparing regular reports and briefings as required for President, Cabinet Committee&#13;
           on PAR, Cabinet, Administrative Reform Secretariat, donors, etc).&#13;
&#13;
SUB-COMPONENT2.3 PAY AND GRADINGREFORM.&#13;
&#13;
31.     Afghanistan's civil service pay scales have been unrevised during the conflict years, while a few&#13;
across the board allowances (mainly food) had lowered the compression ratio to 1.01. The existing 13-&#13;
grades and corresponding pay scales emphasized longevity rather than competence and responsibility in&#13;
promotions. The grades were applied randomly and inequitably across ministries for similar functions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32.     The government is inthe process o f agreeing on a new grade pay structure. The new pay scale i s&#13;
designed with an assumed distribution across 8 grades, with new pay scales attached to these grades (with&#13;
a minimumsalary o f $80 and maximum o f $800). The sequence o f introducing the new pay scales withm&#13;
Government has been partially identified. Those appointed through merit to the new grades 1 and 2 will&#13;
be paid first. This will be followed by regrading positions below these managerial grades on a ministry-&#13;
by-ministrybasis. Complementary policies and processes for severance, early retirement, and pensions&#13;
linked to the P&amp;G policy would be developed. Suitable good governance processes would be built into&#13;
the reform for the implementation o f the new P&amp;G system. A comprehensive communications strategy&#13;
would be developed to informkey stakeholders o f the process and benefits ofthe P&amp;G reforms.&#13;
&#13;
33.     Support under the Project.-The project would finance the regrading o f a large segment o f the&#13;
280,000 existing public sector non-uniformed employees from the grades that they now hold into new&#13;
positions with corresponding responsibilities under the 8-gradeh2 pay point system.&#13;
&#13;
34.     The project would finance the re-alignment o f positions and incumbents, as rapidly as possible,&#13;
while respectingtwo conditions:&#13;
&#13;
             First, thefiscal envelope establishedunder the agreedMTFF which permits a 10%increase&#13;
             inwage bill (attributed to re-grading) inthe current fiscal year- 2007; and 30% increases in&#13;
             the wage bill in each o f the next 3 fiscal years. The current plan is to gwe priority to&#13;
             positions which would become "managerial" under the new system (Levels 1 and 2), which&#13;
             accounts for approximately 6,000 positions. The actual sequencing of ministries and agencies&#13;
             to be re-graded at the levels o f 3 and below would be made by the PAR Steering Committee.&#13;
&#13;
             Second, to make a successful re-assignment of staff to a newly graded position would&#13;
             require adequatejob descriptions and accountabilities, and qualifications established for&#13;
             each position and credible information on the incumbent. Progress has been made under the&#13;
             PRR in modernizing various ministerial and agencies' organizational structures that has&#13;
             reduced (although not entirely) duplication and organizational anomalies. This effort has&#13;
             producedjob descriptions for about 35,000 positions, including a majority o fjobs ingrades 1&#13;
             and 2. Many o f these positions (notably those in grades 5 and below) are in "jobs" that are&#13;
             routine (drivers, cleaners, file clerks) that do not have specific sectoral relevance, so that a&#13;
             revisedjob description inone or two ministries could be re-applied to others.&#13;
&#13;
35.     The risk o f findinga general pattern o f anomalies among functions and poorjob descriptions may&#13;
be mitigated through a process o f arbitration when the need arose as well as judicious sequencing o f&#13;
implementation. Those ministries most advanced on redefining their organizational structure and with&#13;
good coverage with regard to job descriptions will lead the way. Consultants are currently compiling&#13;
existing job descriptions (resulting from the PRR program as well as all others) to establish a basis for&#13;
proceeding with re-grading.&#13;
&#13;
36.     The IARCSC has developed a Pay and Grade Team, comprising about 15 national contractors,&#13;
with some experience injob classification. This team would be mobilized to conduct the bulk o f the re-&#13;
grading o f positions, particularly those at the levels o f 3 and below, and making recommendations&#13;
regardingthe re-assignment o f incumbents for managerial decisions.&#13;
&#13;
37.     Underthese conditions the sub-component would implementthe followingtasks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
i.    Communications strategy. The project would finance a public communications and awareness&#13;
campaign, to be delivered in Dari and Pashto. It would be multi-media in nature (press, radio, pamphlet,&#13;
presentation), and involve explanatory meetings and dialogue with blocks o f stakeholders to elicit&#13;
reactions and mobilize support, as well as traditional one-way communication o f messages. (This will be&#13;
financed from Component 3).&#13;
&#13;
ii. Grades2 and above. The project would finance technical assistance to work with a core group o f the&#13;
IARCSCjob evaluation team to (i)     undertake the "paper-to-paper" regrading o f current positions, graded&#13;
2 and above, to the corresponding position inthe new grade scheme; (ii)     evaluate the probable suitabilitv&#13;
o f the current incumbent for the newly graded position. This work would include:&#13;
&#13;
      0    reviewing job descriptions and qualifications o f all positions in these grades, whether or not&#13;
           they hadbeenpreviously re-assessed for PRRpurposes;&#13;
      0    identify anomalies in these descriptions and functions (duplication,           non-functionality,&#13;
           chronically vacated positions, dubious fine-tuning) that would be referred back to HR and&#13;
           technical experts inthe Commission for review;&#13;
      0    interview positionholders for validation o f their functions;&#13;
      0    modify thejob descriptions to matchreality;&#13;
      0    make a recommendation as to the grade (everyone will be appointed to the floor o f the relevant&#13;
           grade with respect to pay) and&#13;
      0    based on the interview, evidence o f qualifications, make a recommendation on the suitability o f&#13;
           the incumbent and/or the desirability o f opening this positionto competition.&#13;
&#13;
38.      Based on this, a confidential report and recommendation would be submitted to a Technical&#13;
Oversight Committee organized by the a C S C including representatives o f the Appointments Board,&#13;
Ministry of Finance, and relevant ministries to assure consistency and transparency. The AI3 and the&#13;
Commissionwould approve, or not, the recommendations for grading and assignments, which would pass&#13;
through the PAR Steering Committee and be approved for financing by the Ministry o f Finance. Where&#13;
vacancies exist or where it i s recommended that a position be reopened for competition, normal AB&#13;
procedureswould apply.&#13;
&#13;
Grades3 and Below.&#13;
&#13;
39.      The project would provide technical assistance to develop guidelines for regrading positions at&#13;
grades three andbelow, and use the Commission's P&amp;G Team, with extra re-enforcement as necessary, to&#13;
work with HR teams inside individual ministriesto re-grade positions and recommendthe re-assignments&#13;
or not o f incumbents as set out above. This amounts to implementing a reassignment plan for the&#13;
ministrywhich looks at more than vacant positions only. The recommendation would be approved by the&#13;
relevant line Minister, the Commission with AI3 and eventually MoFfor financing.&#13;
&#13;
40.      The project will finance:&#13;
&#13;
         Additional support for a communications campaign (estimated cost $500,000 -currently included&#13;
         under component 3 )&#13;
         International technical assistance to guide the regrading and assessment of positions and staff at&#13;
         grades 1 and 2 (approximately 54 person months o f international technical assistance and some&#13;
         supplementation o fnational consultants to the P&amp;G team inthe CSC ifnecessary).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      32&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Internationaltechnical assistance to guide the regrading and reappointment o f positions and staff&#13;
        at grades 3 and below (approximately 48 person months o f international TA plus supplementation&#13;
        o fnational consultants to the P&amp;G team as needed.)&#13;
&#13;
41.     Owing to the highly specialized and sensitive nature o f this work, an internationally recognized&#13;
firm, with experience injob grading, executive search and placement, personnel management, and public&#13;
communications would be employed to assist the LARCSC P&amp;G Team inimplementingthe program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C. Descriptionof Component3. Oversight andMonitoringofthe PARProgram&#13;

&#13;
                                                          33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Achievements&#13;
43.      The IARCC has made progress in overseeing several important elements o f the public&#13;
administration reform effort. It has led the PRR effort across government, the introduction o fmerit-based&#13;
appointments through the AB, designed grading reform to be implemented across the civil service, and&#13;
ledthe design o fnew PAR strategy.&#13;
&#13;
44.      While having the responsibility for overall management o f the public administration reform&#13;
program, the IARCSC has not demonstrated a well-managed approach to some functions such as&#13;
monitoring, policy development and coordination o f assistance from donors. In spite o f being the focal&#13;
point ofthe PRR, slow improvement inmeeting its own PRR Stage 2 standards lowers its credibility.&#13;
&#13;
Supportprovided under the Grant&#13;
&#13;
45.      This component would include two sets o f actions supporting the Commission's role in (i)      PAR&#13;
program coordination and development in order to manage multiple sources o f donor support, and&#13;
coordinating resource flows to projects, and (ii)    Monitoring and Evaluation, and Communication through&#13;
the Administrative Reform Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
(a)      Program Coordination and Development.               The PAR framework and Civil Service (CS)&#13;
implementationplan provide an opportunity for greater coordination o f donor support. Based on the CS&#13;
implementation plan the Program Coordination Department (PCD) will translate the priority needs into&#13;
actionable investment programs that could be submitted to ARTF or other sources for funding. With&#13;
respect to IDA and other donor financed projects, the PCD would also ensure coordination across&#13;
technical assistance providers as well as adherence to grant agreement requirements.&#13;
&#13;
(b)      Monitoring and Evaluation, Policy and Communications. The absence o f M&amp;E has been a&#13;
constraint to the effective implementation o f public admin reforms. The I-ANDs benchmarks and CS&#13;
implementation plan provide guidance for monitoring developments in organizational structures, human&#13;
resource management practices and the IARCSC's oversight o f the Civil Service. Over time this will&#13;
needto be expanded to include other elements o f the PAR Agenda. The government i s now adopting a set&#13;
o f actionable indicators to measure progress with regard to implementing the Civil Service program and&#13;
more importantly to monitor progress over time inmeetingthe Compact targets.&#13;
&#13;
46.      The Administrative Reform Secretariat (ARS) in the IARCSC needs to develop the capacity to&#13;
periodically monitor and evaluate progress in this regard, identify operational issues and lessons learned,&#13;
support informed decision malung and identify any necessary areas where changes in strategic direction&#13;
are required. The M&amp;E should be used to builda stronger understanding by political representatives and&#13;
senior officials o f PAR and the role o f civil service reform therein, which help to build ownership and buy&#13;
in.A process ofreviewsand clear communicationwill needto engage informdifferent stakeholders such&#13;
decision makers, donors, political representatives, media and citizens. The ARS will need to support&#13;
evidence based M&amp;E and decision making, with a clear communication strategy and outreach, to policy&#13;
makers and key stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
47.      The grantwould finance:&#13;

                    ANNEX IV: PROCURMENTARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
&#13;
1.    The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the procurement environment in&#13;
Afghanistan through its involvement in the interim procurement arrangements put in place through&#13;
Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP) as well as with the institutions such as Afghanistan&#13;
Reconstruction and Development Services (ARDS) that i s holding the current responsibility for&#13;
government's procurement administration. As part o f the broader review o f Afghanistan's Public Finance&#13;
Management (PFM) system, the Bank recently carried out an assessment o f the procurement environment&#13;
inthe country based onthe baseline and performance indicators developed by a group of institutionsled&#13;
by the      World     Bank    and    Organization   for  Economic     Co-operation     and    Development&#13;
(0ECD)Development Assistance Committee (DAC).&#13;
&#13;
2.    The first key issue identified through the procurement assessmentwas the need for ownership and a&#13;
champion in the Government for reform, deepening o f capacity, ensuring integnty in the operation o f&#13;
procurement systems, and promoting sound procurement among ministries.&#13;
&#13;
3.    A new Procurement Law has been adopted inNovember 2005 which radically transforms the legal&#13;
and regulatory framework for the procurement administration o f Afghanistan. While it provides a very&#13;
modem legal system for procurement, effective implementation o f the law may encounter difficulties in&#13;
the current weak institutional structure and capacity o f the Government. A Procurement Policy Unit&#13;
(PPU) has now been established under MoF to ensure implementationthrough the creation o f secondary&#13;
legislation, standard bidding documents, provision o f advice and creation o f the necessary information&#13;
systems for advertising and data collection. "Afghanistan Procurement Regulations'' have been prepared&#13;
under two sections :(i) Regulations; and (ii) Procedures and under review by the Ministry o f Justice prior&#13;
to submission to the Cabinet o f Ministers. Procedures for Procurement Appeal and Review have been&#13;
developed by PPUMoF and the nominated members will be appointed for the system to be functional by&#13;
April 2007.&#13;
&#13;
4.    In the absence of adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively, some interim&#13;
arrangements have been put in place to improve the procurement management o f the country. A central&#13;
procurement facilitation service, ARDS has been established under the supervision o f Ministry of&#13;
Economy. The Bank andthe Government has agreed on a program for country wide procurement reform&#13;
and capacity building, leading to the transition from centralized to decentralized procurement services.&#13;
The Bank funded Public Administration Capacity BuildingProject (PACBP) is the primary instrument for&#13;
implementing the program to strengthen capacity o f the line ministries to manage public procurement in&#13;
an effective, transparent and accountable manner. However, the implementation o f the procurement&#13;
capacity building strategy has not made any significant progress yet due to lack o f coordination and&#13;
delays in decision malung within the Government. The envisaged radical changes to the procurement&#13;
management environment expected from the new L a w also require the urgent implementation o f a&#13;
comprehensive human resources and capacity deveIopment program.              The implementation o f the&#13;
procurement reform component o f the PACBP and the proposed Public Financial Management Reform&#13;
Project should be considered with due priority to ensure that fiduciary standards are further enhanced and&#13;
that capacity i s developed inthe Government to maintainthese standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. ProcurementOverview&#13;
&#13;
General&#13;
&#13;
5.    The Procurement administration o f the project would be camed out in accordance with the World&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004 and revised in&#13;
October 2006, "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated&#13;
May 2004 and revised in October 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement. The&#13;
general description o f various procurements under different expenditure categories are described below.&#13;
For each contract to be financed by the Grant the different procurement methods or consultant selection&#13;
methods, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame agreed between the Grant Recipient&#13;
and the Bank project team are described inthe Procurement Plan. This Procurement Plan will be updated&#13;
at least annually or at lesser time intervals as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs&#13;
and improvements inthe institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
6.    Specific procurement procedures including: defining TORs/technical specifications; preparing&#13;
RFPs/bid/ documents; managing the bidding process including SBDs and evaluation procedures;&#13;
verification mechanisms for receipt o f goods and completion o f assignments by consultants; contract&#13;
administration; and payment procedures will be outlined in a Project Operations Manual, to be&#13;
completed by August 31,2007.&#13;
&#13;
7.    Procurement o f Goods: Goods procured under this project would include office furniture, office&#13;
equipment such as computers and accessories, photocopiers, fax machines, software, communication&#13;
equipment etc. for IARCSC and its regional offices and the provincial governor's offices involved inthe&#13;
project for implementation o f the project activities. Owingto the small number and scale o f requirements,&#13;
ICB would not be an efficient procurement mechanism. All goods would be procured locally following&#13;
NCB procedures using SBDs agreed for the procurement o f goods for Afghanistan portfolio or&#13;
"shopping", when the estimated costs of each contract is less than USD 25,000. Computer software and&#13;
other goods meeting the requirements o f paragraph 3.6 o f Bank's Procurement Guidelines will be&#13;
procured following Direct Contractingprocedures with prior approval o fIDA independent o f value.&#13;
&#13;
8.    Staff Development: The Grant will finance several study tours and incountry workshops.&#13;
&#13;
9.    Selection o f Consultants: Major Technical Assistance contracts to be financed under the grant are:&#13;
(i) Organizational Reformwithin government ministries inAfghanistan ;(ii)       Support Merit Based Human&#13;
Resource Management (iii)        Implementation o f Pay and Grade Reforms; (iv) PAR Oversight M&amp;E&#13;
assignment. In addition there will be several long term national TA inputs. Short lists o f consultants&#13;
(firms) for services estimated to cost less than $ 100,000 equivalent per contract may be composed&#13;
entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant&#13;
Guidelines. For services exceeding US$200,000 or more QBS/QCBS shall be used as appropriately and&#13;
for services estimated to cost less than US$ 200,000, QCBS, CQS, Least Cost Selection, Fixed Budget&#13;
Selection may be used. There will be several long term large value contracts for national individual&#13;
consultants. Such selection shall be in accordance with Section V o f Bank's Guidelines for Selection o f&#13;
Consultants. Single Source Selection o f Consultants for firms and individuals would be allowed with&#13;
prior agreement with IDA.&#13;
&#13;
C. Assessment ofthe Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement&#13;
&#13;
10.      IARCSC have very limited experience in procurement under Bank financed projects.               The&#13;
experience i s mainly inthe selection o f consultants. IARCSC i s carrying out small value procurement o f&#13;
goods and services. There is an administration officer and procurement assistant to take procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
actions inIARCSC. They are responsible to the Director (Finance and Administration), who has authority&#13;
to approve contract awards up to a value o f A F s 200,000 (US$ 4,000 equivalent). Contract award&#13;
recommendations up to a value o f A F s 500,000 (US$ 10,000) can be approved by the Secretary o f the&#13;
Reform Secretariat and awards up to US$ 500,000 will be the responsibility o f the Chairman IARCSC.&#13;
As per the Procurement Law all contracts above US$ 500,000 needs the approval o f the Special&#13;
Procurement Commission under the Ministry o f Finance.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Currently IARCSC i s assisted by the Procurement Unit (PU) o f the Afghanistan Reconstruction&#13;
and Development Services (ARDS) o f the Ministry o f Economy to: (i)   prepare and invite EOIs based on&#13;
the information provided by IARCSC; (ii)     prepare RFPs based on the TORs submitted by IARCSC; (iii)&#13;
guide to submit evaluation reports (in the formats acceptable to IDA) to the donors including IDA upon&#13;
completion o f evaluation by IARCSC staff; (iv) prepare contract documents in respect o f large value&#13;
consultancy contracts o f firms and individuals.&#13;
&#13;
12.     A R D S o f MOE has sufficient experience in Selection o f Consultants under Bank financed&#13;
projects and they are currently supported by an international TA until December 2007. Once the&#13;
consultant's are inplace, the ProgramCoordinationDepartment (PCD) would administer the contracts.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Inrespect ofprocurement ofsmall value goods and individual consultants, IARCSC willneedthe&#13;
support o f a competent procurement officer to prepare bidpackages and evaluation reports with technical&#13;
inputs from the respective end users. IARCSC has agreed to have a nationalprocurement officer inplace&#13;
by July 31,2007. IDAhas assisted inpreparation o f the TOR for the proposed assignment which will be&#13;
financed under the LEP.&#13;
                                      1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.     The following actions have been agreed with IARCSC to mitigate the risks:&#13;
    0   Procurement documentation for large value consultancy contracts shall be carried out by the&#13;
        A R D S - PU o f the Ministry o f Economy, with technical inputs such as TORs and evaluation&#13;
         support from IARCSC;&#13;
    0   Director (Finance &amp; Administration) o f IARCSC shall recruit a competent procurement officer to&#13;
         support and build capacity within IARCSC for small value procurement actions and selection o f&#13;
        individualconsultants;&#13;
        IDA will conduct a capacity buildingprogramon Selectionof Consultants for IARCSC staff.&#13;
&#13;
15.     With the above mentioned procurement risk mitigation measures, the overall project risk for&#13;
procurement i s medium.&#13;
&#13;
D. ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
16.     The Grantee, at the appraisal stage, developed a Procurement Plan (below) for project&#13;
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed&#13;
between the Grantee and the Project Team on April 2, 2007 and i s available at the Office o f the&#13;
Chairman, IARCSC, Shah Mohamood Khan Ghazi Watt (opposite Ministry o f Foreign Affairs), Sidarath&#13;
Compound, Kabul, Afghanistan. It will also be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's&#13;
external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or&#13;
as required to reflect the actual project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
E. FrequencyofProcurementSupervision&#13;
&#13;
17.     In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity&#13;
assessment o fthe ImplementingAgency recommends two supervision missions inevery eighteen months.&#13;

      ANNEX V: FINANCIALMANAGEMENTAND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
                                        ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
1.    The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the financial management&#13;
environment inAfghanistan throughthe large number o fprojects under implementationover the past four&#13;
years.   The Public Administration Capacity Building Project (PACBP) i s the primary instrument to&#13;
continue and enhance the fiduciary measures put in place during the past years to help ensure&#13;
transparency and accountability for the fundingprovidedby the Bank and other donors.&#13;
&#13;
2.    A PFMperformance rating system using28 high-level indicators that was developed by the Public&#13;
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency partnership program was applied in&#13;
Afghanistan in June 2005. PEFA i s comprised o f the World Bank, IMF, EC, and several other agencies.&#13;
The system is structured around six core dimensions o f PFM performance: i)budget credibility, ii)&#13;
comprehensiveness and transparency, iii)policy-based budgeting, iv) predictability and control inbudget&#13;
execution, v) accounting, recording, and reporting, and vi) external scrutiny and audit. Afghanistan's&#13;
ratings against the PFM performance indicators generally portray a public sector where financial&#13;
resources are, by and large, beingused for their intended purposes. This has been accomplished with very&#13;
high levels o f support from international firms; this assistance will continue to be needed over the&#13;
medium term ifthese ratings are to be maintained. There i s also muchroom for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
3.    Despite undeniable gains inreconstruction since the end o f 2001, the challenges facing Afghanistan&#13;
remain immense; not least because o f the tenuous security situation and continued prevalence o f a large&#13;
illegal and illicit economy. The policy framework benchmarks have not yet been fully costed so various&#13;
priorities are funded through the annual budgeting process. The rising costs o f the security sector&#13;
constitute the major constraint on attainment o f fiscal sustainability. With regard to executive oversight,&#13;
the national assembly will play an increasingly active role. All inall, the new national strategy has created&#13;
highexpectations ofthe executive which couldprove to be quite difficult to meet.&#13;
&#13;
4.    The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform its core functions, remains extremely&#13;
weak outside o f Kabul. The lack o f qualified staff in the civil service and delays in reforming the pay&#13;
structure and grading has severely hampered public administration. Domestic revenues lag behind&#13;
expenditures by a factor o f ten to one.        Large-scale corruption could emerge to undermine the&#13;
government's efforts to enhance aid flows through national accounts. Capacities to track expenditures&#13;
and monitor expenditure outcomes have improved, but they need rapid and substantial strengthening if&#13;
progress toward the attainment o f national development targets i s to be monitored. Currently, 75% o f&#13;
external revenues bypass government appropriation systems.&#13;
&#13;
5.    IDA is financing a Financial Management Advisor to assist the Ministry o f Finance, an Audit&#13;
Advisor to assist the Control and Audit Office, and a Procurement Advisor to assist in Procurement-&#13;
related activities. Also an Internal Audit function i s being developed within the Ministry o f Finance with&#13;
World Bank financing. USAID, and earlier the Indian Aid Assistance Program, is financing a team o f&#13;
consultants and advisors to assist D a Afghanistan Bank in local as well as foreign currency operations.&#13;
The activities carried out under the existing Public Administration projects have helped the Government&#13;
to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are maintained for public expenditures, including those&#13;
supportedby the Bank and the donor community.&#13;
&#13;
6.    Progress has been slower than expected in shifting from operations support provided by the three&#13;
Advisors to capacity development and knowledge transfer to the civil servants. It i s expected that the&#13;
Advisors will continue to be requiredfor the medium tern. Challenges still remain inattaining the agreed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
upon fiduciary standards and also to further enhance them. Additionally, the regulatory environment in&#13;
Afghanistan has advanced significantly in the past three years, while the mastery o f basic shlls does not&#13;
fully qualify civil servants to work effectively inthe new emerging environment.&#13;

Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
8.    The Government provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the measures in place to&#13;
ensure appropriate utilizationo f funds will not be circumvented. Government support for the PACBP i s a&#13;
strength in itself to enhance financial management in Treasury operations, public procurement, internal&#13;
audit inthe public sector, andexternal audit by the Auditor General. This i s the second IDA-funded grant&#13;
for the IARCSC so the agency has experience in implementing Bank projects and following Bank&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Weaknessesand Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
9.    The main weakness inthis project, as inmany others inAfghanistan, is the ability to attract suitably&#13;
qualified and experienced counterpart staff especially for Financial Management. The additional staff to&#13;
be funded by the project, together with intensive training programs included inthis project, i s expected to&#13;
strengthen the fiduciary arrangements.&#13;

            Afghanistan - Civil Service Reform Project
            : technical annex
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Civil Service
            Reform Project of Afghanistan supports the implementation of
            critical interventions in the Government's Public
            Administration Reform (PAR) Framework and Civil Service
            Implementation Plan. The project builds on the lessons
            learned from earlier involvement in public administration
            reform in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Specifically, the
            project recognizes that sustaining reforms in public
            administration, and particularly as they relate to public
            sector employment practices, takes time. The project is
            comprised of three components designed to strengthen civil
            service organization and management, including: 1)
            organizational reforms in line ministries which will provide
            support to a number of core ministries to improve service
            delivery through restructuring organization to meet
            functions; directed by a ministry-determined process; 2)
            merit based human resource management policies and practices
            which will support the establishment and implementation
            across government of modem merit based HR policies and
            practices; and 3) PAR Oversight and Monitoring which will
            support the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil
            Service Commission (IARCSC) in carrying out its stewardship
            role under the Civil Service Law to lead, regulate,
            formulate and implement structure policies of the public
            administration system. Under this project the Government
            should have in place a fully funded, regularly monitored and
            well coordinated and communicated Civil Service Reform program.
