Reinsurance and Coinsurance&#13;
During fiscal 2000, MIGA maintained client relationships with&#13;
reinsurers and coinsurers to manage MIGA's country- and project-&#13;
specific capacity limits. Longstanding relationships with MlGA's&#13;
treaty reinsurers ACE Insurance Company, Ltd. (ACE) and Xl.&#13;

MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 2000&#13;
Development of the Private Political Risk Insurance Market&#13;
One of the driving forces behind the rapid growth of the political&#13;
risk insurance market, which is estimated to be growing at 30-40&#13;
Private insurers today are more   percent annually, is the increasing capability of&#13;
capable of matching investors' needs   private insurers to meet the insurance needs of&#13;
tyincreasingly offering   international investors and lenders. The worldwide&#13;
thngbefre by- 1 0 years or longer)  industry size of political risk insurance for invest-&#13;
long-term (7-10 years or longer)&#13;
ment is estimated to be approximately $700-750&#13;
million in terms of annual premium  income.&#13;
Private insurers today account for approximately 50-60 percent&#13;
of this rapidly expanding market.&#13;
Several factors can explain the rapid growth of private insurers&#13;
in the political risk insurance business. First, international inves-&#13;
tors in general are more concerned about political risks than in the&#13;
past. Second, significant insurance and reinsurance capacity has&#13;
been flowing into political risk insurance because the general prop-&#13;
erty insurance market has been "soft"-in other words, an overca-&#13;
pacity has resulted in low prices. Third, international investors and&#13;
financial institutions now feel more comfortable using political risk&#13;
insurance from the private sector. Finally, private insurers today are&#13;
more capable of matching investors' needs by increasingly offering&#13;
long-term (7-10 years or longer) coverage with a greater capacity&#13;
than in the past. In recent years, some insurers appear to have di-&#13;
versified portfolios globally to include coverage in some African&#13;
countries.&#13;
Long-established private insurers in political risk insurance&#13;
include Lloyd's of London and American Insurance Group, Inc. New&#13;
or recently reentering insurers include Zurich US, Chubb &amp; Sons,&#13;
Sovereign Risk Insurance, and Lehman Re. In addition, much of the&#13;
coverage provided by those private and public insurers is reinsured.&#13;
Major reinsurance players in political risk insurance include ACE and&#13;
XL, with which MIGA has entered treaty reinsurance agreements.&#13;
Private insurers and public insurers, including MIGA, are&#13;
viewed very differently in the eyes of investors. Some investors use&#13;
primarily private insurers, some primarily use public insurers, while&#13;
others use both private and public insurers. In general, as viewed&#13;
by investors, private insurers deliver well on product flexibility and&#13;
speed, while public insurers are known to be good at providing&#13;
needed capacity, and bringing to the transaction an understanding&#13;
of, and relationship with, host countries. In an attempt to bring the&#13;
uniqueness of each together and better serve client needs, various&#13;
forms of cooperation among private and public insurers are&#13;
becoming increasingly evident. These include co-insurance, facul-&#13;
tative and treaty reinsurance and MIGA's CUP.&#13;

Looking Back: Societe d'Exploitation des Mines d'Or&#13;
de Sadiola (Mali)&#13;
In fiscal 1996, MIGA issued a contract of guarantee totaling&#13;
$50 million to investors in an open-pit gold mine and treatment&#13;
plant in Sadiola in Mali. MIGA provided coverage against the&#13;
risks of expropriation, transfer restriction, and war and civil dis-&#13;
turbance. MIGA decided to lend its support to the project be-&#13;
cause of the anticipated economic and developmental benefits&#13;
to Mali. The mine was the first MIGA-supported project in Mali&#13;
and, with a total project investment of $271 million, remains&#13;
one of MIGA's largest covered investment in Africa.&#13;
As part of MIGA's ongoing project evaluation, the project&#13;
was visited in November 1999 to evaluate its developmental&#13;
impact and to monitor project-related environmental issues.&#13;

The Sadiola mine also has benefited local&#13;
businesses by giving preference and incentives to&#13;
regional suppliers of production inputs. Since the technology used&#13;
by the operation is fairly new to Mali, there is great potential for&#13;
transferring skills and technology to future Malian mining projects.&#13;
The mine also has encouraged regional cooperation and gener-&#13;
ates crossborder benefits for Senegal. Necessary production in-&#13;
puts are either sourced in Senegal or are being transported through&#13;

New Investment Promotion Tools Deployed. MIGA broad-&#13;
ened its impact on capacity building by implementing the Needs&#13;
Assessment Framework piloted last year. Some 15 countries were&#13;
able to develop a baseline of organizational development from&#13;
which tailored assistance programs can be defined and progress&#13;
measured over time. In addition, a self-assessment methodology&#13;
has been developed and piloted in Asia and is slated for full imple-&#13;
mentation in fiscal 2001. The Investment Promotion Toolkit, a&#13;
handbook of practical techniques for IPAs, has been deployed in&#13;
the field and will be published in multiple languages for wide&#13;
distribution.&#13;

ASIA AND THE&#13;

MIGA worked with the United Nations Development Programme&#13;
and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) on a pro-&#13;
gram in the Tumen region, covering areas of China, People's&#13;
Democratic Republic of Korea, Mongolia and the Primorsky&#13;
Territory in Russia, to establish effective institutional structures&#13;
and policies to promote FDI in a format that facilitates crossborder&#13;
regional integration. MIGA sent a team to assess the capacities&#13;
of the local investment promotion councils and to examine areas&#13;
for potential cooperation among them. MIGA then recommended&#13;
specific actions to improve standards of investment promotion&#13;
programs in each agency, It also proposed that a regional investor&#13;
services network be created as a technology-based initiative to&#13;
improve the quality of investor assistance. The program was&#13;
discussed and finalized at a regional workshop in Beijing, and&#13;
agencies are now mobilizing resources for its implementation.&#13;
The MIGA Indochina project, a technical assistance&#13;
program financed by the Japanese Trust Fund, seeks to improve&#13;
investment flows into Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic&#13;
Republic, Mongolia, and Vietnam by enhancing host governments'&#13;
abilities to attract and service investors. Specifically, the project&#13;
provides assistance in four areas to host country investment&#13;
intermediaries: investment promotion strategy wvorkshops, invest-&#13;
ment promotion skills training, capacity building for sectoral pro-&#13;
motion, and software and training for the agency Web site and an&#13;
investor tracking system. Following a detailed assessment of&#13;
agency requirements, MIGA staff and clients jointly agreed on&#13;
location-specific activities, which are currently underway. A team&#13;
of MIGA staff, in partnership with local and international experts,&#13;
will provide on-the-ground assistance in the various target areas&#13;
throughout the summer of 2000.&#13;

to provide hands-on technical assistance&#13;
to Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philip-&#13;

and implement effective strategies for&#13;
attracting new FDI and to familiarize po-&#13;

The Swiss government provided funding to MIGA for a series of&#13;
technical assistance efforts and regional workshops to support&#13;
investment promotion agencies in Central Asia. Efforts included&#13;
needs assessments in Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, and FYR&#13;
Macedonia to define needed programs. Proposals were put for-&#13;
ward to Azerbaijan and FYR Macedonia for the establishment of&#13;
IPAs in both countries and a skills building program was sug-&#13;
gested for staff of the existing agency in the Kyrgyz Republic, to&#13;
be conducted in late 2000. Azerbaijan has since announced plans&#13;
to establish an investment promotion agency, and the govern-&#13;
ment of FYR Macedonia has started to reform its IPA along the&#13;
lines proposed by MIGA.&#13;

Nicaragua. Since the early 1990s, Nicaragua has been steadily&#13;
improving its business environment to encourage FDI. Notwith-&#13;
standing the setbacks caused by Hurricane Mitch, the country&#13;
has continued its work to attract higher levels of foreign invest-&#13;
ment, although these efforts have been constrained by institu-&#13;
tional weaknesses. MIGA began work with the Center for Exports&#13;
and Investment (CEI) in the first quarter of fiscal 2000 with a&#13;
needs assessment that revealed several areas where the CEI and&#13;
the government needed to direct immediate attention. Based on&#13;
this assessment, MIGA designed a training seminar that was&#13;
delivered later in the quarter; additional technical assistance has&#13;
been requested for the year ahead.&#13;
El Salvador. During an April mission to El Salvador, MIGA staff&#13;
met with decisionmakers from both the public and private sec-&#13;
tors and with the staff of the newly formed investment promo-&#13;
tion agency PRO.ESA, to conduct a preliminary needs assess-&#13;
ment. Thereafter, MIGA outlined a work program that will guide&#13;
PRO.ESA and the Government of El Salvador toward meeting&#13;
their institutional and national objectives for FDI promotion.&#13;
Organization of Caribbean States. In the Organization of&#13;
Caribbean States (OECS) and St. Lucia in particular, recent eco-&#13;
nomic events have highlighted the need for diversification-a&#13;
process in which FDI can play an important role. MIGA worked&#13;
with agencies in all nine OECS countries to meet the challenges&#13;
of this renewed effort to attract higher levels of FDI. Following&#13;
an analysis of the national and regional investment environments,&#13;
the capacity of their IPAs and the regulatory regimes governing&#13;
FDI, MIGA delivered a tailored workshop to the OECS that&#13;
included both a broad introduction to investment promotion prin-&#13;
ciples and instruction in the use of specific tools for promoting&#13;
these island states.&#13;

around three major events in fiscal 2000.&#13;
The Fourth Annual Latin America and&#13;
Caribbean Hotel and Tourismn Investment&#13;
Forum took place in Los Angeles in Janu-&#13;
ary 2000. This was the second year that&#13;
MIGA participated in the organization of&#13;
this event, and international attendance&#13;
was the highest recorded since the Forum&#13;
was launched.&#13;
In Brazil, MIGA collaborated with&#13;
the World Economic Forum in organizing&#13;
the Investment Promotion Strategy Forum&#13;
in conjunction with the MERCOSUR&#13;
Economic Summit 2000. Attended by&#13;
heads of IPAs and related agencies from&#13;
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, it&#13;
provided a platform for discussions about&#13;
the regional context for FDI. The partici-&#13;
pants were also introduced to best prac-&#13;
tice and several case studies in investment&#13;
promotion through a series of presenta-&#13;
tions given by the MIGA team. In Ecuador,&#13;
MIGA conducted a regional workshop in&#13;
conjunction with the United Nations&#13;
Conference on Trade and Development&#13;
(UNCTAD) and the Andean Community&#13;
Secretariat. Representatives from each of&#13;
the five Andean Community Member&#13;

Tunisia. MIGA executed a multifaceted technical assistance pro-&#13;
gram with the Foreign Investment Promotion Agency of Tunisia&#13;
(FIPA) during July and August 1999. MIGA has been working&#13;
with FIPA for several years to provide basic skills training and&#13;
Internet development training, and more recently to provide&#13;
assistance in investor targeting, marketing, and follow-up. The&#13;
work program involved training in sector-specific research on the&#13;
Internet, new skills in investor targeting and contact, and one-&#13;
on-one coaching on how to prepare and present proposals to&#13;
potential investors. In addition, MIGA supervised a consultant&#13;
who accompanied FIPA staff on a visit to follow up with 10 po-&#13;
tential investors in the United States, several of whom expressed&#13;
interest in the Tunisian proposals.&#13;
Saudi Arabia. The Government of Saudi Arabia recognizes the&#13;
mining sector as a potentially important source of economic&#13;
benefits. Earlier this year it decided to review the sector's policy,&#13;
legal, and institutional framework to attract increased private&#13;
direct investment, both from local and foreign sources. MIGA&#13;
led a World Bank Group team that carried out a detailed review&#13;
of government policy in the heavy minerals sector and devel-&#13;
oped an action plan. Activities consisted of assessing the pro-&#13;
posed new mining law, institutional arrangements, tax regimes,&#13;
and overall policy for the sector. The resulting report facilitated a&#13;
high-level policy dialogue in Saudi government and business&#13;
circles.&#13;
In late October MIGA organized a mining strategy work-&#13;
shop in Riyadh that was attended by 150 Saudi officials. The&#13;
workshop was an opportunity to share experiences on interna-&#13;
tional best practices in attracting private investment in the sector,&#13;
identify policy constraints, and propose a set of strategic options&#13;
for consideration to the ministers of finance and petroleum and&#13;
minerals. The workshop provided new and vital information&#13;
to decisionmakers and strengthened the working relationship&#13;
between Saudi Arabia's public and private sectors.&#13;

In the past year MIGA has been working closely with the rest of&#13;
the WNorld Bank Group to formulate an integrated approach to&#13;
private sector development. MIGA is providing the hands-on sup-&#13;
port needed by national investment promotion agencies to iden-&#13;
tify, approach, and service foreign investors. MIGA is collaborat-&#13;

export sector through capacity building assistance to facilitate&#13;
inward investment. MIGA also collaborated with the rest of the&#13;
World Bank Group in implementing private sector strategies for&#13;
CGte d'lvoire, Rwanda, Senegal, and other African nations.&#13;
Cote d'lvoire. MIGA sent a delegation to the 1999 Invest in&#13;
C&amp;te d'lvoire Forum, an event that brought together more than&#13;
2,500 participants, including delegations from neighboring coun-&#13;
tries and international investors from around the world. The main&#13;
thrust of the forum was to accelerate the development of the&#13;
small- and medium-sized enterprise sector, which is considered a&#13;
dynamic but neglected dimension of African economies.&#13;
During the forum, discussions revolved around ways that&#13;
MIGA could help accelerate the development of the private sec-&#13;
tor, particularly the high-potential small- and medium-sized in-&#13;
vestment segment. In both C6te d'lvoire and Ghana, small- and&#13;
medium-sized firms have failed to benefit fully from economic&#13;
growth. Lack of equity capital and credit facilities limit their access&#13;
to technology, which leads to low productivity and inhibits their&#13;
ability to compete in international markets, resulting in lower&#13;
export revenues and less ability to save and undertake new capital&#13;
investment. The attempts of most agencies to deal with the small-&#13;
and medium-sized enterprise sector have yielded mixed results,&#13;
and the sector continues to suffer from technical and financial&#13;
problems.&#13;
Ghana. MIGA designed, supervised, and concluded a technical&#13;
assistance activity under a $50 million World Bank trade and in-&#13;
vestment support project for the Government of Ghana. The goal&#13;
was to improve the institutional capacity of inward investment&#13;
agencies to attract export-oriented investment. MIGA developed&#13;
and implemented a phased approach toward building the skills&#13;
needed to generate investment among the staff of these agencies.&#13;

Regional Outreach. After establishing relationships with priva-&#13;
tization agencies in the Europe and Central Asia and Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa Regions, deployment of PrivatizationLink in the Middle&#13;
East and North Africa region began in fiscal 2000. A Memoran-&#13;
dum of Understanding was signed with the Moroccan Ministry&#13;
of Public Sector and Privatization to cooperate in marketing&#13;
privatization assets. A similar memorandum was signed with the&#13;
Egyptian Ministry of Public Enterprises and the information flow&#13;
to the PrivatizationLink Web site has begun.&#13;
PrivatizationLink began with six pilot countries in the Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa region. Since then, the number of participating&#13;
privatization agencies in the region has more than doubled.&#13;
However, Sub-Saharan Africa has had difficulties deploying&#13;
PrivatizationLink because privatization has been a stop-and-go&#13;
process in the region, and communication links are poor. In&#13;
contrast, almost all countries in the Europe and Central Asia region&#13;
quickly embraced the PrivatizationLink concept and are regu-&#13;
larly supplying data on enterprises being divested. The approach&#13;
of the PrivatizationLink team has been to reach out to countries&#13;
region-by-region. A focused outreach effort to Latin America and&#13;
the Caribbean and Asia and the Pacific will take place in the&#13;
coming year.&#13;
PrivatizationLink was a finalist in the public   Figure 14. PrivatizationLink Benefits&#13;

new release the following year. Two-thirds of respondents were&#13;
from developed countries, one-third from developing countries-&#13;
a representative sample of PrivatizationLink user composition.&#13;
Overall, respondents were very satisfied with the current&#13;
product. Eighty percent rated the level and quality of site content&#13;
to be "good" or "excellent." Respondents also gave high ratings&#13;
for navigability and ease of use. Respondents stated that the service&#13;
has facilitated concrete transactions and has contributed to their&#13;
organizations' business activities (figure 1 4).&#13;

Survey respondents also identified a clear set of priorities&#13;
for contact and functional enhancements to the site. They would&#13;
like to see more privatization background information on such&#13;
countries as China and India; data on the energy, telecommuni-&#13;

The next release of PrivatizationLink, which will take into account&#13;
the results of the survey, is planned for fiscal 2001.&#13;

Estonia Web Site Assessment. Responding to a request from&#13;
the Estonian Investment Agency, MIGA assessed the organization's&#13;
Web site to find how to increase site traffic and maximize mar-&#13;
keting impact. The assessment report evaluated the Web site in&#13;
the context of its general marketing strategy and made recom-&#13;
mendations to increase site usage and heighten its influence in&#13;
investor decisionmaking. This type of assessment is a new service&#13;
for MIGA, and one that appears to be of interest to clients. Based&#13;
on its experience working with IPAs and the international in-&#13;
vestment community, the IPAniet team is developing guidelines&#13;
for best practices on the Internet in this field. The team con-&#13;
ducted a similar assessment of the WVeb site of the Central Bank&#13;
of Cyprus and led a workshop for the bank's International Busi-&#13;
ness Department staff in developing a state-of-the-art site for&#13;
promoting investment in the financial services sector.&#13;
New Investor Tracking System in Africa. MIGA worked with&#13;
key staff at Malawi's investment promotion agency to develop&#13;
business process specifications and data and functionality require-&#13;
ments for an investor tracking system. The agency is working&#13;
with a commercial vendor to configure the new system and&#13;
convert databases into the new format.&#13;

Global Development Gateway. MIGA's&#13;
Information Products and Services Unit&#13;
contributed to the scaling-up effort of&#13;
the World Bank Group in fiscal 2000&#13;
through the development of the Global&#13;
Development Gateway. MIGA's suite of&#13;
online investment information services-&#13;
IPAnet and PrivatizationLink--and exper-&#13;
tise in developing Internet-based services&#13;
for the private sector provide a good&#13;
basis for joining this World Bank Group&#13;
initiative to establish and promote a Web-&#13;
based clearinghouse for development&#13;
knowledge and information.&#13;
MIGA has played a key role in the&#13;
design of the private sector component of&#13;
the Global Development Gateway and&#13;
will focus on the implementation of new&#13;
resources and services related to foreign&#13;
direct investment. The Global Investment&#13;
Exchange, a WVeb- and email-based service&#13;
planned for deployment in fiscal 2001, will&#13;
also provide an important new tool to&#13;
stimulate business-to-business contacts&#13;
online. It may prove especially effective&#13;
for transactions among Category Two&#13;
countries, previously constrained by time,&#13;
distance, lack of information, or expense.&#13;

LEGAL ACTIVITIES&#13;
LEGAL ACTIVITIES&#13;
M,IGA's Legal Affairs and Claims department assists member&#13;
countries with matters related to foreign investment, provides&#13;
legal advice to underwriters on issuing insurance coverage, and&#13;
handles claims for compensation brought under MIGA's contracts.&#13;
The first claim since MIGA's establishment was filed in March&#13;
1999 when a power project was postponed in Indonesia. For more&#13;
than a year, MIGA pursued discussions with the investor and the&#13;
host government to find a mutually acceptable solution. During&#13;
the period, the host country refunded MIGA's expenses. In June&#13;
2000, MIGA paid the $15 million claim since the discussions&#13;
could not be finalized by the deadline agreed upon with the guar-&#13;
antee holder. Negotiations with the Government of Indonesia&#13;
continue, and it is expected that a solution may be found in the&#13;
near future.&#13;
In addition to those investment disputes in which it is&#13;
involved as insurer, MIGA, in accordance with its Convention,&#13;
uses its good offices to encourage the settlement of other dis-&#13;
putes between investors and member countries. MIGA staff&#13;
experienced in resolving conflicts relating to foreign investment&#13;
provided legal assistance and guidance during the year to parties&#13;
from numerous countries that sought creative approaches to the&#13;
resolution of their investment-related disputes. MIGA's objec-&#13;
tive in these cases is to resolve disputes before they require formal&#13;
arbitration.&#13;
At any given time, MIGA's legal staff may be consulting on&#13;
as many as a dozen investment disputes around the world.&#13;
Mediation is normally a more expeditious form of dispute reso-&#13;
lution than arbitration. However, when the issues are complex&#13;
or a host country is challenged to rethink substantial elements of&#13;
its economic policies, settlement talks can drag on for several&#13;
years until the parties become comfortable enough with the&#13;
results of their efforts to strike a deal.&#13;
59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 2000&#13;
The cases that are now advancing&#13;
toward resolution suggest that MIGA's&#13;
mediation facilities are filling a gap in&#13;
international law remedies currently avail-&#13;
able to foreign investors in their disputes&#13;
with host countries. Diplomatic solutions&#13;
are not practical for some, and formal&#13;
arbitration may be too costly for others.&#13;
Mediation, which is voluntary, informal,&#13;
and inexpensive, is increasingly recognized&#13;
as an attractive alternative for resolving&#13;
investment disputes.&#13;
Upon the request of member states,&#13;
MIGA advises on the negotiation of&#13;
bilateral investment treaties and other&#13;
investment-related issues. MIIGA's lawvers&#13;
lectured at law schools and universities&#13;
in China, Italy, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka,&#13;
Switzerland, lurkey, and the United States&#13;
during the fiscal year and at conferences&#13;
and workshops to promote foreign in-&#13;
vestment.&#13;

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), estab-&#13;
lished on April 12, 1988, is a member of the World Bank Group,&#13;
which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corpora-&#13;
tion (IFC), and the Intemational Development Association (IDA).&#13;
MIGA's activities are closely coordinated with and complement&#13;
the overall development objectives of the other World Bank in-&#13;
stitutions. MIGA is designed to help developing countries attract&#13;
productive foreign investment by both private investors and com-&#13;
mercially operated public sector companies. Its products include&#13;
guarantees or insurance against noncommercial risks and a pro-&#13;
gram of advisory services and technical assistance to support&#13;
member countries' efforts to attract and retain foreign direct&#13;
investment.&#13;
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND&#13;
RELATED POLICIES&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity&#13;
with International Accounting Standards and with generally ac-&#13;
cepted accounting principles in the United States. The policy&#13;
adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances&#13;
of MIGA having regard to its legal requirements and to the prac-&#13;
tices of other international insurance entities.&#13;
Use of Estimates&#13;
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with&#13;
International Accounting Standards and generally accepted&#13;
accounting principles in the United States requires management&#13;
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts re-&#13;
ported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from&#13;
those estimates. The following summary of policies adopted by&#13;
MIGA is provided to assist readers in the interpretation of these&#13;
financial statements.&#13;
Translation of Currencies&#13;
MIGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United&#13;
States dollars solely for the purpose of summarizing MIGA's&#13;
financial position and the results of its operations for the conve-&#13;
nience of its members and other interested parties.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
MIGA is an international organization that may conduct&#13;
its operations in the currencies of all its members. MIGA's re-&#13;
sources are derived from its capital and retained earnings in its&#13;
members' currencies. MIGA strives to minimize exchange rate&#13;
risks in a multicurrency environment. As such, MIGA attempts&#13;
to match its contingent obligations in any one currency with as-&#13;
sets in the same currency on a pro-rata basis.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency&#13;
conversions on a pro-rata basis to match the currencies underlying&#13;
its reserves with those of the outstanding contingencies. The&#13;
purpose of these conversions will be to minimize currency&#13;
exposure that may occur through operations. Otherwise, MIGA&#13;
will not convert one currency into another except for small&#13;
amounts required to meet certain operational needs.&#13;
Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of&#13;
exchange at the end of the period. Capital subscriptions are stated&#13;
in accordance with the procedures described below. Income and&#13;
expenses generally are translated at an average of the market rates&#13;
of exchange in effect during each month. Translation adjustments&#13;
are charged or credited to retained earnings.&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock&#13;
Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members&#13;
subscribing to the capital stock of MIGA shall be settled on the&#13;
basis of the average value of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) in&#13;
terms of United States dollars for the period January 1, 1981 to&#13;
June 30, 1985, such value being equal to $1.082 for one SDR.&#13;
Investments&#13;
As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, to diversify&#13;
its credit exposure to commercial banks and to obtain higher&#13;
returns, MIGA invests in government and agency obligations&#13;
and time deposits according to its credit risk and maturity policies.&#13;
Government and agency obligations include highly rated fixed&#13;
rate bonds, notes, bills, and other obligations issued or uncondi-&#13;
tionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other official&#13;
entities, including government agencies or by multilateral orga-&#13;
nizations.&#13;

MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 2000&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
During the third quarter of fiscal 1999, MIGA began in-&#13;
vesting in securities classified as available-for-sale in accordance&#13;
with the new investment guidelines approved by the Board of&#13;
Directors on November 12, 1998. Maturing investments in the&#13;
held-to-maturity were added to the available-for-sale portfolio&#13;
until the held-to-maturity portfolio had fully matured.&#13;
Investments classified as available-for-sale, which are those&#13;
securities that may be sold prior to maturity as part of asset/&#13;
liability management or in response to other factors, are carried&#13;
at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in the Balance&#13;
Sheet as a component of other comprehensive income. Inves-&#13;
tments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost.&#13;
Revenue Recognition&#13;
Revenue from premium payments for direct insurance and&#13;
reinsurance contracts assumed and ceded is recognized on a pro-&#13;
rata basis over the contract period. Revenue from commitment&#13;
fees, which are fees paid by investors to reserve for a limited&#13;
period of time guarantee capacity for future use, is recognized on&#13;
a pro-rata basis over the commitment period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims&#13;
The reserve for claims provides for potential losses, net of future&#13;
premiums, inherent in guarantee operations based on an esti-&#13;
mation of the net present value of future premium income as&#13;
compared to the net present value of future losses related to&#13;
guarantee operations. MIGA has incurred only one loss to date&#13;
(see Note E). Accordingly, MIGA has computed expected future&#13;
losses by reference to (i) the loss experiences of other insurers&#13;
engaged in similar underwriting, (ii) the composition and volume&#13;
of outstanding guarantee contracts, and (iii) the worldwide&#13;
economic and political environment. This reserve is available to&#13;
absorb future losses related to outstanding guarantees and is in-&#13;
creased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by claims&#13;
settlements.&#13;
The level of provision is based upon management's evalu-&#13;
ation of potential losses, net of future premiums, that may result&#13;
from (i) risks that are inherent, but unidentifiable at the time of&#13;
76&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
reporting, (ii) unusually large concentrations of exposure to in-&#13;
dividual risks, countries or guarantee contracts, and (iii) an ongo-&#13;
ing assessment of MIGA's expected recovery rates. Sufficient&#13;
claims reserves are established at the end of each year to cover&#13;
all of the estimated future losses arising from contracts outstand-&#13;
ing at that time on a net present value basis; future provisions are&#13;
then established to reflect changes in MIGA's outstanding port-&#13;
folio.&#13;
In the event of a formal filing of claim by an investor and&#13;
upon receipt of full evidence of the occurrence of the covered&#13;
risk, MIGA normally has between two and six months to deter-&#13;
mine its liability under the contract, depending on the type of&#13;
coverage and contract terms, and 60 days thereafter to pay the&#13;
claim.&#13;

Investments were denominated primarily in U.S. dollars&#13;
with instruments in nondollar currencies representing 8.2 per-&#13;
cent (7.3 percent - June 30, 1999) of the portfolio.&#13;
NOTE B: CAPITAL STOCK&#13;
The MIGA Convention established MIGA's authorized capital&#13;
stock at 100,000 shares with a provision that the authorized capi-&#13;
tal stock shall automatically increase on the admission of a new&#13;
member to the extent that the then authorized shares are insuf-&#13;
ficient to provide the shares to be subscribed by such member.&#13;
At June 30, 2000, the initial authorized capital stock increased&#13;
to 101,843 (101,640 - June 30, 1999) shares. The Convention&#13;
further states that 10 percent of the members' initial subscrip-&#13;
tion be paid in cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that&#13;
developing member countries may pay up to a quarter of the 10&#13;
percent in their own currencies. An additional 10 percent of the&#13;
initial subscription shall be paid in the form of nonnegotiable,&#13;
noninterest bearing promissory notes. The notes are denominated&#13;
in freely convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet&#13;
MIGA's obligations. The remaining 80 percent is subject to call&#13;
when required by MIGA to meet its obligations.&#13;
On March 29, 1999, the Council of Governors approved a&#13;
resolution increasing the authorized capital stock of MIGA by&#13;
78,559 shares to be subscribed by members during the subscrip-&#13;
tion period ending March 28, 2002. Of the additional capital,&#13;
17.65 percent is to be paid in cash, in freely convertible currency.&#13;
The remaining 82.35 percent is subject to call when required by&#13;
MIGA to meet its obligations.&#13;

NOTE C: GUARANTEES PROGRAM AND&#13;
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES&#13;
Guarantees Program. MIGA offers guarantees or insurance&#13;
against loss caused by noncommercial risks (political risk insur-&#13;
ance) to eligible investors on qualified investments in developing&#13;
member countries. MIGA insures investments for up to 20 years&#13;
against four different categories of risk: currency transfer, expro-&#13;
priation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract.&#13;
Insurance for currency transfer protects the investor from losses&#13;
arising from an inability to convert local currency returns and&#13;
proceeds from the liquidation of the investment project into for-&#13;
eign exchange for transfer outside the host country. Insurance&#13;
for expropriation protects the investor against partial or total&#13;
loss of the insured investment as a result of acts by the host gov-&#13;
ernment that may reduce or eliminate ownership of, control over,&#13;
or rights to the insured investment. Insurance for war and civil&#13;
disturbance protects the investor against losses from damage to,&#13;
79&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 2000&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
or the destruction or disappearance of tangible assets caused by&#13;
politically motivated acts of war or civil disturbance in the host&#13;
country. Insurance for breach of contract protects the investor&#13;
against the impossibility to obtain or to enforce an arbitral or&#13;
judicial decision recognizing the breach of an obligation by the&#13;
host government. Investors may insure projects for any combi-&#13;
nation of the four types of coverage. MIGA guarantees, other&#13;
than those issued as reinsurance, cannot be terminated unilaterally&#13;
by the guarantee holder within the first three years from the&#13;
date of issuance. Premium rates applicable to issued contracts&#13;
are fixed for five years. Payments against all claims under a guar-&#13;
antee may not exceed the maximum amount of coverage issued&#13;
under the guarantee.&#13;
As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of&#13;
Governors, the maximum aggregate amount of contingent liabili-&#13;
ties that may be assumed by MIGA is 350 percent of the sum of&#13;
MIGA's unimpaired subscribed capital and its reserves plus such&#13;
portion of the insurance ceded by MIGA through contracts of&#13;
reinsurance as the Board of Directors may determine. Accordingly,&#13;
at June 30, 2000, the maximum level of guarantees outstanding&#13;
may not exceed $6,933,749,000.&#13;
Contingent Liability. The maximum amount of contingent li-&#13;
ability of MIGA under guarantees outstanding at June 30, 2000&#13;
totaled $4,364,812,000 ($3,675,475,000 - June 30, 1999). The&#13;
maximum amount of contingent liability is MIGA's maximum&#13;
exposure to insurance claims, which includes "standby" coverage&#13;
for which MIGA is committed but not currently at risk. At June&#13;
30, 2000, MIGA's estimate of its actual exposure to insurance&#13;
claims exclusive of standby coverage was $2,329,948,000&#13;
($1,945,571,000 - June 30, 1999). At June 30, 1999, approxi-&#13;
mately 43 percent of the contingent liability represents guaran-&#13;
tees issued that will expire on or after June 30, 2010.&#13;
As of June 30, 2000, additional guarantee capacity&#13;
amounting to $117,000,000 has been committed ($105,459,000&#13;
-June 30, 1999)&#13;
Claim Activity. In June 2000, MIGA paid its first claim, an ex-&#13;
propriation claim related to a power project in Indonesia, amount-&#13;
ing to $15,000,000, of which 70 percent was reinsured. Net&#13;
amount paid by MIGA was $4,500,000.&#13;

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
NOTE D: REINSURANCE&#13;
Although MIGA obtains quota-share and facultative reinsurance&#13;
to augment its underwriting capacity and to protect portions of&#13;
its insurance portfolio, it remains responsible to the insured cli-&#13;
ent for the entire amount of the insurance contract. Of the&#13;
$4,364,812,000 outstanding contingent liability (gross exposure)&#13;
as at June 30, 2000 ($3,675,475,000 - June 30, 1999),&#13;
$1,548,856,000 was ceded through contracts of reinsurance&#13;
($1,067,933,000 - June 30, 1999). Net exposure amounted to&#13;
$2,815,956,000 as at June 30, 2000 ($2,607,542,000 - June 30,&#13;
1 999).&#13;
MIGA also can provide both public (official) and private&#13;
insurers with facultative reinsurance. As of June 30, 2000, total&#13;
insurance assumed by MIGA, primarily with official investment&#13;
insurers, amounted to $124,472,000 ($110,140,000 - June 30,&#13;
1999).&#13;
Estimated reinsurance recoverables have been determined&#13;
based upon a review of the selected contracts in force and other&#13;
available information.&#13;
Premiums relating to direct, assumed, and ceded contracts&#13;
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2000 and June 30, 1999 were&#13;

NOTE F: STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN&#13;
The World Bank Group has a defined benefit retirement plan&#13;
(Plan) covering substantially all of MIGAs staff. The Plan also&#13;
covers substantially all the staff of IBRD and IFC. Under the Plan,&#13;
benefits are based on the years of contributory service and the&#13;
highest three-year average of pensionable remuneration as defined&#13;
in the Plan, with the staff contributing a fixed percentage of&#13;
pensionable remuneration, and the World Bank Group&#13;
contributing the remainder of the actuarially determined cost of&#13;
future Plan benefits. The actuarial present values of Plan&#13;
obligations throughout the fiscal year are determined at the&#13;
beginning of the fiscal year by the Plan's actuary. MIGA's total&#13;
contribution to the Plan is based upon the aggregate funding&#13;
method. All contributions to the Plan and all other assets and&#13;
income held for the purposes of the Plan are held separately from&#13;
the other assets and income of the World Bank Group and can be&#13;
used only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their&#13;
beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid or&#13;
provided for. Plan assets consist primarily of equity and fixed&#13;
income securities, with small holdings of cash, real estate and&#13;
other investments.&#13;
Net periodic pension income allocated to MIGA and in-&#13;
cluded in income from Staff Retirement Plan for the fiscal year&#13;
endedJune 30,2000 was $2,576,000 ($3,740,000-June 30,1999).&#13;
NOTE G: OTHER POSTRETIRMENT BENEFITS&#13;
IBRD provides other postretirement benefits for eligible active&#13;
and retired World Bank Group staff, including MIGA. These ben-&#13;
efits can be grouped under two major types, i.e. health care and&#13;
82&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
life insurance benefit and the pensions administered outside of&#13;
the Staff Retirement Plan (discussed in Note F). IBRD has desig-&#13;
nated assets to fund these liabilities.&#13;
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, the World Bank&#13;
Group reviewed the status of the postretirement benefits and&#13;
determined that the net assets and liabilities did not qualify for&#13;
off-balance-sheet accounting. Consequently, at June 30, 1998,&#13;
the assets and liabilities were recorded on IBRD's balance sheet.&#13;
At June 30, 2000, MIGA has included in other assets a&#13;
prepaid postretirement benefits cost of $135,000 ($324,000 -&#13;
June 30, 1999) relating to its share of the postretirement benefits&#13;
net assets. Expense resulting from the decrease in MIGA's share&#13;
of these net assets for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000 was&#13;
$189,000 ($174,000 - June 30, 1999).&#13;
NOTE H: SERVICE AND SUPPORT FEE&#13;
The IBRD charges MIGA an annual Service and Support Fee,&#13;
which for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, amounted to&#13;
$984,000 ($860,000 - June 30, 1999).&#13;
NOTE 1: COMPREHENSIVE INCOME&#13;
During the third quarter of fiscal 1999, MIGA adopted the&#13;
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 130,&#13;
"Reporting Comprehensive Income". SFAS No. 130 defines and&#13;
establishes the standards for reporting comprehensive income.&#13;
Under SFAS No. 130, certain items that historically were not&#13;
recognized in the calculation of net income are now included in&#13;
the broader definition of comprehensive income. Comprehen-&#13;
sive income has two major components: net income and other&#13;
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income comprises&#13;
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments and&#13;
currency translation adjustments.&#13;
NOTE J: ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES&#13;
The estimated fair values of MIGA's cash and nonnegotiable,&#13;
noninterest-bearing demand obligations are assumed to&#13;
approximate their carrying values. The estimated fair value of&#13;
MIGA's investments shown in Note B is based on market&#13;
quotations. The estimated fair values are only indicative of&#13;
individual financial instruments' values and should not be con-&#13;
sidered an indication of MIGA's fair value.&#13;

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency&#13;
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the&#13;
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, as of June 30, 2000&#13;
and 1999, including the statement of subscription to capital stock&#13;
and voting power and the statement of guarantees outstanding&#13;
as of June 30, 2000, and the related statements of income, com-&#13;
prehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows&#13;
for the years then ended. These financial statements are the re-&#13;
sponsibility of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency's&#13;
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these&#13;
financial statements based on our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with International&#13;
Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards&#13;
in the United States of America. Those standards require that&#13;
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance&#13;
about whether the financial statements are free of material mis-&#13;
statement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence&#13;
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial state-&#13;
ments. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles&#13;
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as&#13;
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe&#13;
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in&#13;
all material respects, the financial position of the Multilateral&#13;
Investment Guarantee Agency as of June 30, 2000 and 1999 and&#13;
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then&#13;
ended in conformity with International Accounting Standards&#13;
and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States&#13;
of America.&#13;

MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 2000&#13;
INVESTMENT GUARANTEE GUIDE&#13;
The guarantees program is designed to encourage the flow of&#13;
foreign private investment to developing member countries by&#13;
mitigating political risks associated with a project. Beyond its&#13;
investment guarantees, MIGA's participation in a project enhances&#13;
confidence that the investor's rights will be respected, an advan-&#13;
tage inherent in MIGA's organization as a voluntary association&#13;
of developing and developed countries.&#13;
The coverages described below may be purchased individu-&#13;
ally or in combination, but selection of the desired coverages must&#13;
be made by an investor before MIGA issues its guarantee.&#13;
MIGA offers coverage against the following types of political risks:&#13;
Transfer Restriction. Protects against losses arising from an&#13;
investor's inability to convert local currency (capital, interest, prin-&#13;
cipal, profits, royalties, and other remittances) into foreign&#13;
exchange for transfer outside the host country. The coverage&#13;
insures against excessive delays in acquiring foreign exchange&#13;
caused by host government action or failure to act, by adverse&#13;
changes in exchange control laws or regulations, or by deteriora-&#13;
tion in conditions governing the conversion and transfer of local&#13;
currency. Currency devaluation is not covered.&#13;
Upon receiving blocked local currency from an investor,&#13;
MIGA pays compensation in the currency of its contract of&#13;
guarantee.&#13;
Expropriation. Protects against loss of the insured investment&#13;
as a result of acts by the host government that may reduce or&#13;
eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured&#13;
investment. In addition to outright nationalization and confisca-&#13;
tion, "creeping" expropriation-a series of acts that, over time,&#13;
have an expropriatory effect-is also covered.&#13;
Coverage is available on a limited basis for partial expro-&#13;
priation (confiscation of funds or tangible assets, for example).&#13;
Bona fide, nondiscriminatory measures by the host government&#13;
in the exercise of legitimate regulatory authority are not covered.&#13;
For total expropriation of equity investments, MIGA pays&#13;
the net book value of the insured investment. For expropriation&#13;
of funds, MIGA pays the insured portion of the blocked funds.&#13;
94&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIXES&#13;
INVESTMENT GUARANTEE GUIDE&#13;
For loans and loan guaranties, MIGA insures the outstanding prin-&#13;
cipal and any accrued and unpaid interest.&#13;
Compensation will be paid upon assignment of the&#13;
investor's interest in the expropriated investment (equity shares&#13;
or interest in a loan agreement, for example) to MIGA.&#13;
Breach of Contract. Protects against losses arising from the host&#13;
government's breach or repudiation of a contract with the inves-&#13;
tor. In the event of an alleged breach or repudiation, the investor&#13;
must be able to invoke a dispute resolution mechanism (such as&#13;
arbitration) in the underlying contract and obtain an award for&#13;
damages.&#13;
If, after a specified period of time, the investor has not&#13;
received payment or if the dispute resolution mechanism fails&#13;
because of actions taken by the host government, MIGA will pay&#13;
compensation. MIGA may make a provisional payment pending&#13;
the outcome of the dispute resolution mechanism.&#13;
War and Civil Disturbance. Protects against loss from damage&#13;
to or destruction or disappearance of tangible assets caused by&#13;
politically motivated acts of war or civil disturbance in the host&#13;
country, including revolution, insurrection, coups d'&amp;tat, sabotage,&#13;
and terrorism.&#13;
For equity investments, MIGA will pay the investor's share&#13;
of the least of the book value of the assets, of their replacement&#13;
cost, or of the cost of repair of damaged assets.&#13;
For loans and loan guaranties, MIGA will pay the insured&#13;
portion of the principal and interest payments in default as a&#13;
direct result of damage to the assets of the project caused by war&#13;
and civil disturbance.&#13;
War and civil disturbance coverage also extends to events&#13;
that, for a period of one year, result in an interruption of project&#13;
operations essential to overall financial viability. This type of busi-&#13;
ness interruption is effective when the investment is considered&#13;
a total loss; at that point, MIGA will pay the book value of the&#13;
total insured equity investment. For loans and loan guaranties,&#13;
MIGA pays the insured portion of the principal and interest pay-&#13;
ments in default as a result of business interruption caused by&#13;
covered events.&#13;

INVESTMENT GUARANTEE GUIDE&#13;
ELIGIBLE INVESTMENTS&#13;
MIGA can guarantee new, crossborder investments originating&#13;
in any member country and destined for any developing mem-&#13;
ber country. New investment contributions associated with the&#13;
expansion, modernization, or financial restructuring of existing&#13;
projects, and acquisitions involving privatization of state enter-&#13;
prises, are also eligible.&#13;
Eligible forms of investment include equity, shareholder&#13;
loans, and loan guaranties issued by equity holders, provided the&#13;
loans and loan guaranties have terms of at least three years. Loans&#13;
to unrelated borrowers can be guaranteed, provided an eligible&#13;
shareholder registers its investment with MIGA. Other eligible&#13;
investments include technical assistance, management contracts,&#13;
and franchising and licensing agreements, provided their contrac-&#13;
tual commitments have terms of at least three years and remu-&#13;
neration of the investor is tied to the operating results of the&#13;
project. MIGA may guarantee other forms of investment&#13;
approved by its Board of Directors.&#13;
In keeping with MIGA's objective of promoting economic&#13;
growth and development, investment projects should contribute&#13;
to host country needs, such as job creation, technology transfer,&#13;
and export generation. The projects must also be financially,&#13;
economically, and environmentally sound.&#13;
ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS&#13;
An eligible applicant must be a national of a member country&#13;
other than the country in which the investment is to be made.&#13;
Corporations or financial institutions are eligible for coverage if&#13;
they are either incorporated in and have their principal place of&#13;
business in a member country or if they are majority-owned by&#13;
nationals of member countries. State-owned corporations are also&#13;
eligible if they operate on a commercial basis.&#13;
DURATION OF GUARANTEE&#13;
MIGAs standard term of coverage is 15 years. Coverage may be&#13;
issued for 20 years when justified by the nature of the project.&#13;
The contract term for investments other than equity generally&#13;
follows the term of the guaranteed agreement. MIGA cannot&#13;
terminate the Contract of Guarantee unless the guarantee holder&#13;
defaults on its contractual obligations to MIGA. But the guarantee&#13;

INVESTMENT GUARANTEE GUIDE&#13;
holder may reduce or cancel coverage on any anniversary date of&#13;
the contract following the third.&#13;
AMOUNTS OF COVERAGE&#13;
In each risk category, MIGA may guarantee equity investments&#13;
for up to (i) 90 percent* of the investment contribution, plus&#13;
(ii) an additional percentage of the investment contribution to&#13;
cover earnings attributable to the investment.&#13;
For loans and loan guaranties, MIGA may guarantee up to&#13;
(i) 90 percent* of the principal, plus (ii) an additional percent-&#13;
age of the principal to cover interest that will accrue over the&#13;
term of the loan.&#13;
For technical assistance contracts and other contractual&#13;
agreements, MIGA may insure up to 90 percent* of the total&#13;
value of payments due under the insured agreement.&#13;
Regardless of the nature of the project, an investor is re-&#13;
quired to remain at risk for a minimum of 5 percent of any loss.&#13;
In addition to MIGA's coverage for a project, additional coverage&#13;
may be mobilized through cooperation with other political risk&#13;
insurers.&#13;
HOW TO APPLY FOR A MIGA GUARANTEE&#13;
Preliminary Application for Guarantee&#13;
An applicant seeking coverage from MIGA should submit a&#13;
Preliminary Application before the investment is made or irre-&#13;
vocably committed. The Preliminary Application provides the&#13;
information MIGA needs to make a provisional determination&#13;
of the eligibility of the applicant and the investment. Upon&#13;
qualification, a Notice of Registration, along with a Definitive&#13;
Application for Guarantee, will be sent to the applicant.&#13;
MIGA will register Preliminary Applications for eligible in-&#13;
vestments in countries that have signed but not yet ratified the&#13;
MIGA Convention. For eligible investments in countries that have&#13;
not yet signed the Convention, MIGA will consider issuing a&#13;
Letter of Intent to formally register the project when the country&#13;
signs the Convention.&#13;
* In exceptional circumstances MIGA may guarantee up to 95 percent.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA ANNUAL REPORT 2000&#13;
INVESTMENT GUARANTEE GUIDE&#13;
Applicants are encouraged to contact MIGA if they have&#13;
any questions about the eligibility of an investment.&#13;
Definitive Application for Guarantee&#13;
Once investment and financing plans are established, an applicant&#13;
should promptly complete and return the Definitive Application&#13;
for Guarantee to MIGA, along with any relevant project docu-&#13;
mentation, such as a joint venture contract, feasibility study, and&#13;
an environmental assessment. The Definitive Application pro-&#13;
vides the detailed information MIGA needs to underwrite a&#13;
project and prepare a Contract of Guarantee. This information&#13;
ascertains the eligibility of the applicant, the amount and type of&#13;
investment, types of coverage desired, the developmental impacts&#13;
of the project, and the project's financial and economic viability.&#13;
Premiums and Fees&#13;
There is no charge for filing a Preliminary Application. However,&#13;
MIGA charges an Application Fee to process a Definitive Appli-&#13;
cation. If the application is submitted and a guarantee is offered&#13;
and accepted, the fee will be credited against the first year's&#13;
premium. If MIGA declines to offer coverage, the fee will be&#13;
refunded. If MIGA offers to provide a guarantee and the appli-&#13;
cant declines the offer, the fee is nonrefundable.&#13;
MIGA also will charge a Processing Fee for additional&#13;
underwriting costs incurred in evaluating projects that are envi-&#13;
ronmentally sensitive (oil and gas, mining, infrastructure) or whose&#13;
complex financial structures require retention of outside advi-&#13;
sors by MIGA. If the exceptional costs incurred are less than the&#13;
Processing Fee, the unused balance will be refunded to the appli-&#13;
cant; if greater, the applicant will be charged for the additional&#13;
amount.&#13;
The Processing Fee should be submitted concurrently with&#13;
the Definitive Application and Application Fee. Applicants should&#13;
contact MIGA prior to sending the Definitive Application to&#13;
determine whether a Processing Fee is applicable.&#13;
Premium rates are decided on a per project basis, accord-&#13;
ing to the specific risks to be guaranteed by MIGA. Premium is&#13;
paid annually to MIGA in advance of MIGA's commitment.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIXES&#13;
INVESTMENT GUARANTEE GUIDE&#13;
HOST COUNTRY APPROVAL&#13;
MIGA must obtain the approval of the host country to issue a&#13;
Contract of Guarantee. MIGA will request such approval&#13;
following receipt of a Definitive Application.&#13;
COOPERATION WITH OTHER POLITICAL RISK&#13;
INSURERS&#13;
MIGA actively cooperates with public and private political risk&#13;
insurers through coinsurance and reinsurance arrangements for&#13;
joint coverage of eligible investment projects. These collabora-&#13;
tive efforts significantly increase available insurance capacity for&#13;
applicants seeking to expand their businesses in developing coun-&#13;
tries. Treaty reinsurance, in particular, enables MIGA to offer&#13;
additional coverage and expand its gross capacity without&#13;
increasing its exposure.&#13;
In collaboration with the private insurance market, MIGA&#13;
created the Cooperative Underwriting Program (CUP), a form&#13;
of coinsurance in which MIGA is the insurer-of-record among&#13;
other participating underwriters. The CUP is designed to expand&#13;
available investment insurance capacity for applicants by encour-&#13;
aging private underwriters to offer coverage in developing coun-&#13;
tries where the underwriters might not have guaranteed invest-&#13;
ments without the involvement of a multilateral institution such&#13;
as MIGA.&#13;
These forms of coinsurance and reinsurance substantially&#13;
increase the amount of coverage available to investors.&#13;
INSURANCE BROKERS&#13;
MIGA accepts submissions from eligible specialized or gener-&#13;
alist political risk insurance brokers. Specialized brokers actively&#13;
work with MIGA and the applicant throughout the under-&#13;
writing process. MIGA pays commission to the broker-of-record&#13;
for issued contracts only.&#13;
