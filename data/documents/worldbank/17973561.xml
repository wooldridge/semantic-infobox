Interview by: Marie T. Zenni&#13;
&amp;#12;ZENNI: Good morning. I'm Marie Zenni, Senior Interviewer for the Bank 's&#13;
Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: And I'm Ann Hamilton .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Today is Monday, April 10, 2006, and I'm here at World Bank&#13;
headquarters to interview Ann Hamilton, who re t ired from the Bank back around&#13;
the end of 1997 as senior adviser to the Vice President for South Asia.&#13;
Welcome, Ms . Hamilton .&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: I would like to begin by asking you to discuss your background in&#13;
general, including your educational background, and how you became interested&#13;
in international economic de v elopment.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Well, let's see. I was born and grew up in Texas, which probably&#13;
accounts for my outspokenness and my, you know , general rudeness all around.&#13;
But I went to college in the East at Wellesle y and never went back to Texas.&#13;
Then after graduating in economics, I went on to the London School of&#13;
Econom icÂ·s where I didn't study very much a t all, but wh a t I did study w as&#13;
international e conomics. So in early 1961, I got my mast e r's in e conomic&#13;
science from LS E and came back to answer the call of John Kennedy to serv e&#13;
my country .&#13;
&#13;
I wa s also following a young man who wa s also a nswering the call , which m a de&#13;
the choice fairly easy. W e broke up a year or so la ter, but we're still fri e nds.&#13;
He e ventually becam e the U.S . Ex e cutive Director of the World Bank, showing&#13;
what a small world it is; his name was Charles Cooper. But, anyway , I came to&#13;
Washington to look for work, and the two places that seemed interested in hiring&#13;
me w e re th e Agenc y for International Developm e nt which was brand n e w in&#13;
tho se days- - it had just chan ged its name to AID- -a nd th e P ea c e Corps. I w e nt to&#13;
work for th e P e ace Corps in its very e a rly d a ys. T here w e r e probably 20&#13;
employees there at the time, in April of '61 .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How old was the Peace Corps then?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: It didn't ev e n e xist. I m ea n , it hadn't e ve n b ee n leg is lat e d yet.&#13;
One o f my f ir s t jobs w as working a lot on th e esta blishin g leg is la tion a nd&#13;
speeches, and the congressional present a tion , and then definin g what a Peace&#13;
Corps was, which wa s pretty interes ting . We kind of invented the Peace Corps.&#13;
It w a s very excitin g be ing there a t t ha t time. It w a s probabl y t wo years from th e&#13;
time I arriv e d befor e the fir s t v olunte ers w e nt o ve rseas be c aus e they had to se t&#13;
up tra ining pro g rams a nd admissions crit e ri a a nd r e cruitm e nt and a ll kind s of&#13;
s tu ff. And I w as lucky e no u g h to partici pa t e in a ll o f th a t. I w as eve n lu c ki er&#13;
                                       Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;
                                 April 10, 2006 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
because when I left the Peace Corps, I was scheduled to go to what was then&#13;
called the Budget Bureau, now OMB, the Office of Management and Budget.&#13;
But, anyway, in those days it wasn't management; it was just budget, the Budget&#13;
Bureau. And that was February of '64.&#13;
&#13;
And just then, Lyndon Johnson established the War on Poverty, and I begged&#13;
Sargent Shriver to take me with him to the War on Poverty, which he did. Once&#13;
again there was no staff. Everybody was seconded from some other agency. We&#13;
moved offices about once every two weeks wherever we could scrounge free&#13;
space. And once again, I got to participate in the invention of an agency. That&#13;
was very exciting: you know, what kind of activities would be in the poverty&#13;
program; what would it call itself; again, drafting the enabling legislation, et&#13;
cetera. It was terrific fun. But then the Budget Bureau got tired of paying my&#13;
salary without having had me work there for a single day. So they called me&#13;
back in about November or December of '64, and I stayed there until my third&#13;
child was born, when I retired briefly. That 1969. Now, we're getting close to&#13;
the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The entire time I worked at the Budget Bureau I was working on the aid program&#13;
and on the South Asia part of the aid program. Greg [Gregory B.] Votaw, who&#13;
was deputy director of the South Asia Department here at the Bank, was&#13;
somebody whom I had bumped into both socially and professionally all over&#13;
town. And every time I saw him, he said, "When are you going to come work&#13;
for us?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Not yet, Greg, not yet," because I loved my job at the Budget&#13;
Bureau.&#13;
&#13;
When I had been retired for about 18 months I bumped into Greg at a party, and&#13;
he said, "When are you going to come work for us?"&#13;
&#13;
And. I said, "How about tomorrow?" calling his bluff completely. But, by golly,&#13;
one thing led to another and I did join the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
I also am proud of my ground-breaking experience here, in that I insisted on&#13;
working part-time, and I think I was the first person ever to do that at the Bank .&#13;
They couldn't imagine that back in 1970. They couldn't hire me as a regular&#13;
staff member because they had no provision for part- time staff. They hired me&#13;
as a consultant, and except for translators - - they had part-time translators--! do&#13;
not think they had any other part-time staff and had not figured out how to&#13;
handle it. So I like to think that I broke ground for future generations of part-&#13;
time staff, especially women. I joined, working three days a week. And then at&#13;
the end of the year I looked over my time sheets and realized that I was reall y&#13;
working four days a week , so I said, "Okay , I'll increase my contract by a day&#13;
and work four days a we e k" . And at the e nd of that y e ar , I realized that I was&#13;
                                  Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;
                             Apri/10, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                  3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
really working five days a week, which meant that I could get a 25-percent&#13;
increase in salary with no change at all in my work habits. So I agreed to join&#13;
the staff as a regular staff member.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And that was when exactly?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: That must have been '72, I guess. The personnel records are&#13;
rather inaccurate because sometimes they say I joined in '70, sometimes they say&#13;
I joined in '71 when my consultant contract was renewed, and sometimes they&#13;
say I joined in '72.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, the record I received from HR indicates that you joined&#13;
officially as a full-time regular staff in November of '71.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Maybe regular staff, but not yet full-time. It was probably the&#13;
next year that I said I would like my 25-percent pay increase by admitting that&#13;
I'm working five days a week, because l was a real workaholic. I mean, I really&#13;
worked eight days a week.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: So you joined in November of '71 as a regular staff in the early period&#13;
of the [Robert S .] MeN amara era as loan officer/economist in the India Division,&#13;
South Asia Department. Please describe your first assignment in terms of&#13;
responsibilities and areas of particular focus.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Actually, my first assignment was fascinating. Peter Cargill was&#13;
direct.or at the time of South Asia. At that time, Ed [EdwardS .] Mason and Bob&#13;
[Robert E.] Asher were writing their history of the World Bank, and they needed&#13;
somebody to do the history of the Bank's involvement in India. Since I was a&#13;
brand new staff member- and part-time at that--and they didn't know what to do&#13;
with me, my main task for a couple of months was interviewing all of the old-&#13;
timers in the India program, going way back to the beginning. And that was&#13;
really terrific because it gave me (a) a bunch of friends, ready-made, and (b) the&#13;
most fascinating background on the Bank's history in India. I remember Ben&#13;
[Benjamin B.] King and Peter Wright--and Ben was really important--and, of&#13;
course, Peter Cargill himself, and the Indian officials who happened to be&#13;
coming through town. I learned a lot about the India program. I was really&#13;
lucky to have had an excuse to talk to the greats and the near-greats. I was&#13;
always very honored that I was mentioned in the acknowledgements of the&#13;
Mason and Asher book for my work as a brand new staff member in providing&#13;
them background information on India. That was really terrific for my sort of&#13;
unusual first assignment.&#13;
&#13;
My other first assignment was a fertilizer project. I became the fertilizer queen.&#13;
I can't remember which project was my first one, but I worked on a whole series&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;
                            April 10, 2006 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of ferti I izer projects. They said, "So do you want to be a loan officer or do you&#13;
want to be an economist?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, " They both sound great; I can't choose." And so I was a loan&#13;
officer/economist, which was very exciting, except that as the computer program&#13;
got more and more fi lied, they had less space to put a ti tie in to it, so it got&#13;
gradually truncated, which reflected exactly my own career.&#13;
&#13;
The immediacy of loan officer work completely crowded out the long-term&#13;
analytical thinking of the economic work. So I moved from being a loan&#13;
officer/economist to a loan officer/econ, to a loan officer/ec, to a loan officer,&#13;
which pretty accurately reflected the' content of my work, as well.&#13;
&#13;
In those early days, I was your standard loan officer on all kinds of fertilizer&#13;
projects, Calcutta urban development, and a lot of Indian Railways projects.&#13;
Probably the most exciting one I ever dealt with was the Bank's first oil project,&#13;
which was the Bombay High project. I was Ms. Infrastructure. I was the thing&#13;
that went out of favor and is now moving back into favor. Of course, the&#13;
project officers did the real analytic work on the project, and I just massaged&#13;
staff appraisal reports and made sure that they made sense and hung together&#13;
and answered all the right questions and read well. That was an important part&#13;
of any project.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay. Since appraisal reports contain the basic technical documents&#13;
of a project, i ncl ud i ng basic j usti fica ti on for the Bank's involvement, how would&#13;
you assess the procedural guidelines governing their content and structure, and&#13;
the impact of that on project design and proj e ct outcome?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: That's a tough question. It was time-consuming , it was very&#13;
presentational, but I think the emphasis that was put on clear presentation and&#13;
the number of layers of review, which were numerous, was pretty valuable and&#13;
time pretty well-spent. By the time you got to the Board [of Executive&#13;
Directors], through yellow, gree n and gray, and throu g h th e Loan Committee&#13;
and the Legal Department, and through the procurement people, and through&#13;
other reviewers, you had checked all aspects of the project very thoroughly . It&#13;
was alleged, and it is probably true , that that put a disproportionate amount of&#13;
weight on the up-front part and inadequate w e ight on the implementation part.&#13;
&#13;
But as for th e up-front part, I think it was a valuable experience. It certainly&#13;
could have been streamlined a little bit. I think it has probably been&#13;
streamlined too much, because now that kind of ex ante quality control--I don't&#13;
really know, but I think--is probably non-existent, or at least hardly exists.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: W e ll , now the focus is on outcom e and impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;
                              Aprill 0, 2006 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Which, of course, you cannot measure for decades. That's a lot&#13;
of loose talk as far as I'm concerned. In the appraisal report, you could promise&#13;
things, but you couldn't be sure they would be reflected in the outcomes. First&#13;
of all, you've got maybe a five-year project implementation period to see&#13;
whether it even works the way it was supposed to on the ground. And then how&#13;
do you measure outcomes? Suppose it does work, suppose it does turn out&#13;
power or railroad cars , it is decades before you could measure the impact of tha t&#13;
on the country. I kind of liked the old system because I felt I had a huge&#13;
support system. The entire Bank was hard at work making sure m y appraisal&#13;
report and everybody else's appraisal report was as good as it could be . It made&#13;
me feel secure to know that all those fancy people were helping me write this&#13;
report. Some people groused about the editing and the improvement. I enjoyed&#13;
it ; I loved it. I found it valuable.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Since your work was focused mostly in India .&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Entirely, yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes. How would you describe the Bank's engagement in South Asia,&#13;
and specifically, in India at the time?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Well, India was always special to the Bank . I always said that&#13;
the Bank needed India more than India needed the Bank. To take a step asi de ,&#13;
and jumping ahead a little bit, too , I've always said tha t there are thr ee kinds of&#13;
cases in the Bank, two of which are virtually unique. One , w here you've go t&#13;
client countries who do whatever the Bank says . They ma y und erstand w hat&#13;
they have agreed to do , they may not , but they just say yes, and the y probably&#13;
try to do it. And the Bank is the boss a nd th e c ountry is the subserv ient partner.&#13;
In the case of India , that was almost rev e rs e d. Every bod y pret e nded that it&#13;
wasn't so, but it was. The way I could work well with the Indians was to say,&#13;
"Look , here is what I need for Bank purposes. Wh a t do you need for Indian&#13;
gove rnment purposes ? Now, where 's the common g round so th at we can make&#13;
this work? I don't want to argue."&#13;
&#13;
The third kind was my later work on Indon es ia which was very nearl y an eq ual&#13;
partne~ship , and it was the onl y case that I had seen of tha t. That , too, has&#13;
disappe a red. But coming back to th e question--we'll come to Indonesia later--&#13;
one had no choice, and wanted no choice, other than to listen to the government ,&#13;
to understand why the y wa nted to do it th e way the y wa nt ed to do it, to&#13;
understa nd what their cons train ts were a nd to t r y to accommodate tho se&#13;
constraints . And they were smart enough to be a ble to pack age and articulate&#13;
their position enough so that it pleased us while pl eas in g them. But it was a&#13;
sensational relationship because as lo ng as y ou kn e w a nd accep t e d t h at , you h ad&#13;
to respect them completely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;
                               April 10, 2006 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, there is a long-held view that the Bank's relationship with&#13;
India- a nd you've already spoken to that--was unique and that the Bank learned&#13;
more from its experience in India than India learned from the Bank. How do&#13;
you see this?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, first of all, the India Consortium was the first aid group&#13;
established, from which virtually all other countries have now learned. It was&#13;
established shortly before my time, sometime in the '60s, but it was the first and,&#13;
for a very long time, the only aid group. It was the model for aid groups and&#13;
how they worked and how donors got to get her and talked to the borrowing&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
What happened was, you sat round the table and every single country gave a&#13;
little lecture to the government, who had to sit there and listen and take it, abou t&#13;
what policies they wanted to see followed and what changes they wanted to see&#13;
made.&#13;
&#13;
And, I remember the then-Secretary of Finance, I.G. Patel , saying at the end of&#13;
one long day--because they were always two-day meetings--"Listen , at the rate&#13;
of $1 billion a day, I can listen to anything." That sort of said it all. He w as&#13;
listening politely while every single donor country ventilated a little bit, and&#13;
then he took the money and went home and followed his own polic y agenda.&#13;
&#13;
And it was a superb civil service that we were working with, better than the&#13;
American civil service, probably as good as the British civil service whose&#13;
model it was based on . They were educated, intelligent. Of course we learned&#13;
from them. They knew what they were doing.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay , we'll come back to India a little later. Meanwhile, following&#13;
through with your career a little chronological ly at this point, in 1972, a&#13;
comprehensive examination of the Bank's organization and structure took place&#13;
under McNamara, resulting in a major reorganization in October of '72 to&#13;
decentralize Bank operations. What impact did this have on your work at the&#13;
time?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: I can hardly remember an impact on my actual work. It was&#13;
certainly disruptive in the extreme. It was disruptive even before it happened ,&#13;
for as long as one anticipated it , because you knew changes were in the wind&#13;
and you didn't know what they were. So it slowed things down and made&#13;
everybody very anxious for a while before it happened. And then it h a ppened.&#13;
Prior to that reorganization there was a Projects Department and se v eral&#13;
Programs Departments, which worked very well. The reorgani za tion put the&#13;
project staff inside each region wh e re there was a projects and a program&#13;
department. In the end, I thought it was a step backward , but it was prett y&#13;
uninteresting.&#13;
                                   Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;
                             April 10, 2006- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: So in terms of achievements, what would you say the '72&#13;
reorganization achieved?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Primarily disruption. One of our standard jokes was how they&#13;
changed every so often from one Asia Department to two Asia Departments&#13;
(South and East), back to one Asia Department, and then back to two Asia&#13;
departments, several times. We often said, "Oh, so now it's time to go back to&#13;
one, or to split us into two." It made them feel like progress was being made.&#13;
They, the leadership, somebody, had a strong view that option A was better than&#13;
option B, and so it was implemented. It was very disruptive, and pretty soon,&#13;
like water, it sort of settled back down to its own level and people figured out a&#13;
way to work. One of the beauties of the Bank is that everybody cares about&#13;
their work, so no matter what the reorganizers are doing, people find a way to&#13;
do their work.&#13;
&#13;
But I think all of these reorganizations are silly, unnecessary and unbelievably&#13;
disruptive. Sometimes changes need to be made, but they can be made&#13;
piecemeal. But every president needs to put his imprimatur on things; we had&#13;
the McNamara reorganization, the [Barber B.] Conable reorganization, and the&#13;
whoever-it-was, reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: You remained in South Asia for quite a while, actually up until July of&#13;
'83. In the interim, you were promoted in January of '7 5 to senior loan officer,&#13;
then in '78 to division chief. Please discuss highlights of how your work&#13;
evolved during thi"s period. And, as line manager, what did this entail in terms&#13;
of additional responsibilities for you?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, the change from loan officer to senior loan officer was&#13;
nothing but more money, a higher salary, which was certainly all to the good.&#13;
The promotion to division chief was a fundamental change. Bilsel Alisbah had&#13;
been the previous division chief and he was promoted to director somewhere,&#13;
either in East or West Africa. I forget where he went, but he went, and I was&#13;
made acting division chief because I'd been there longer than anybody and was&#13;
the most senior, if not the only senior loan officer. They were very reluctant to&#13;
make me division chief because I'd been there so long, and the Bank was very&#13;
much into movement, circulating. Everybody blamed ever y body else. David&#13;
Hopper, who was the vice president, said that the person blocking my promotion&#13;
was Ernie [Ernest] Stern, who said I'd been there too long. I went to Ernie&#13;
Stern, who was a good friend, and said, "If you're telling me I've been there too&#13;
long for the good of the Bank, I'll listen to you because it's your job. If you're&#13;
telling me I've been there too long for my own good, you're wrong, and that's&#13;
my job. Here's what I do best, and here's what I want to do."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Finally, after an endless period as acting--I don't even remember how long it&#13;
was between the date of Bilsel's departure and the date of my actual promotion,&#13;
but it was very long-- I was fi nail y made division chief. I remember B i lsel gave&#13;
me a T- shirt that said "division chief" with a huge question mark undernea t h it.&#13;
It did go on for a I ong time whi I e they dithered. But they finally made me&#13;
division chief. What year was that that?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: December '78, according to the HR records.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: By then, I'd been there for, depending on how you count , six or&#13;
seven or eight years, which was (a) about the right length of time to understand&#13;
what I was doing and to get to know the system, but ( b) too long for their t aste&#13;
because it meant that they were committed to another two or three years. Now,&#13;
I happen to think that 10 years or even 12 is not too long in an assignmen t, but&#13;
it made them very anxious.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: So what did this entail in terms of additional responsibilities as a line&#13;
manager?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: As an actual manager it was sad for me because instead of&#13;
ma.naging projects, I managed people who managed projects. I was a very&#13;
hands-on person so I had to just knock myself out not to interfere in their day-&#13;
to-day work. Mostly I think they appreciated it because I was helpf ul to them.&#13;
It was before the days of attitude surveys, so I don 't even know whether th ey&#13;
loved or hated it, but I think a lot of people enjoyed it. Of course, some didn't.&#13;
As a manager, I was one step removed, which was a place I was less happ y than&#13;
doing the actual work. Managing the people doing the work was less fun. But I&#13;
didn't want anybody else to be division chief, so I'm glad I got the job.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Now turning to world events at that time, there were the two oil&#13;
shocks in '73 and '79 that had major economic repercussions world w ide . Please&#13;
discuss the Bank 's approach in enabling South Asian countries to bette r adjust&#13;
economically. And how did this impact your work on India at the time?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Two ways that I can think of. On e was just more of th e same .&#13;
India was always a poor country with foreign exchange constraints and&#13;
budg e tary constraints, and the oil shock just made those constraints a lit tle bit&#13;
worse. So you just had to work a little bit harder-or, more accurately, the y had&#13;
to work a little bit harder--to deal with the foreign exchange constraint and the&#13;
budgeta ry constraint. T h e re was no qualitative ch ange in the relationship that I&#13;
can remember.&#13;
&#13;
T he other thin g that happened was- - in a year that I can't r eme mb er--w as that&#13;
India discovered a huge oil reserve in the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Bombay.&#13;
It was a field called Bombay High. Well, I can tell yo u for sure it was when&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bilsel Alisbah was division chief. We went out to try to persuade the&#13;
government of India and the chairman of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission,&#13;
who was a very powerful guy, that they should let the Bank in on this work.&#13;
The whole world was sniffing around. I mean, here was a major oil projec t, a&#13;
major find. There was big money in it. Private sector oil companies were d y ing&#13;
to get in. The Indian government was determined to keep it within t he public&#13;
sector and they sure didn't want the Bank messing around in their oil sector.&#13;
But we won over the government and the chairman of the Oil and Na tural Gas&#13;
Commission. We were sensational salesmen of the Bank. And that was more&#13;
fun than I've ever had because all of a sudden Indi a was on the winning side&#13;
instead of the losing side of the oil shocks. And the y did a phenomenal job of&#13;
developing that field very fast.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And what was your contribution?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: I was the loan officer on that. It was the biggest and most&#13;
important project I ever handled. It was huge. We moved unbelievabl y fast.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And what was it called?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: The Bombay High Petroleum Project, I suppose. But nobod y has&#13;
ever worked harder or faster. A Frenchman ..&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yves Rovani?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: No. Yves Rovani was the department dir ecto r. He would walk&#13;
around saying in his very French accent, "This is not going to work. Cargill&#13;
does not like oil."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Don't worr y, Yves, I'm going to make Cargill like oil; this pr oject&#13;
is going to work ."&#13;
&#13;
Philippe Bourcier was the proje c t officer--we worked tog et her every step of the&#13;
way. This was the way a proje ct officer and a loan officer sho uld work toge th er.&#13;
We worked 20 hours a day. We got that project ready a nd within two months it&#13;
was perfect. We had covered every teensy aspect and it was great fu n . And I'm&#13;
still friends with that chairman of th e Oil a nd Natural Gas Co mmi ss ion.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: The '70s and '80s saw a shift in the B a nk's sec toral pattern of project&#13;
l en din g more towards agriculture and the socia l sectors . What impact d id this&#13;
have on your work in India, and how would yo u characterize the effectiveness of&#13;
the Bank's approach--more emphasis o n agriculture a nd the soc ia l sec tors ?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, what I re member about agriculture was the in frast ru ct ure&#13;
bit , irri gat ion. There was always a lot of emphas is on irrigation, and it didn't&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
change much. Were there more community development integrated agricultural&#13;
development projects? If so, I don't remember them much.&#13;
&#13;
In the social sectors, India didn't want us in there, and so we were not in there.&#13;
The Secretary of Education said, "I don't want you mucking around in my&#13;
curricula. The education of our children and the content of the textbooks is too&#13;
important. I don't want somebody calling the shots from 5,000 miles away."&#13;
Some people thought we could make a big difference to Indian education. I&#13;
thought he was right. Since then--after the Bank got better at lending for&#13;
education and after the Indian government got more aware of the fact that we&#13;
didn't impose political views on textbooks or anything else--a good relationship&#13;
developed, but that was way after my time. During my time, India was always&#13;
very conservative in these new initiatives and they didn't take hold.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: In terms of financing, South Asia inc! udes some of IBRD&#13;
[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and IDA's&#13;
[International Development Association] largest and oldest borrowers. India is&#13;
dependent almost entirely on the Bank and IDA for its multilateral borrowing.&#13;
Based on your experience, how well did IBRD and IDA projects serve India's&#13;
overall development priorities in terms of poverty alleviation at the time?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Well, that's quite a basic philosophical question because it&#13;
depends on how you feel about, in effect, trickle-down economics. I mean, if&#13;
you build irrigation projects, the farmers at the top of the water flow, who are&#13;
already the better-off farmers, benefit enormously. The benefit gets less and&#13;
less and less as you go down to the tail-end farmers who get very little water.&#13;
But does the existence of the irrigation project, the fact that there's just more&#13;
wealth in that area, help the poor farmer enough to justify the investment at all?&#13;
It's even trickier with, say, electric power. How do you measure the impact of&#13;
being able to turn on a light or run a pump for irrigation or for drinking water or&#13;
for whatever? I don't know how to trace the impact of that on poverty. The&#13;
same is true about India's goal of producing more fertilizer. It goes to the&#13;
richest farmers first and the poorest farmers Iast, but if you don't have the&#13;
fertilizer, nobody benefits and there's no trickle-down effect with everybody&#13;
benefiting a I i ttle bit. Take rai I ways, high ways--the fact that people can travel--&#13;
it's all the same question. So the first part of your question a bout how did it&#13;
help and affect India's policies ? The answer is hugely well and effectively.&#13;
How did it affect poverty? I'll never know.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How would you characterize the Bank's policy dialogue with India at&#13;
the time?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Well, it obviously had a major impact in the long run. Our&#13;
policy dialogue said, "Give the private sector more scope, give them more room;&#13;
don't do everything in the public sector," which was their model for most of the&#13;

z            So the answer is, the polic y dialogue worked.&#13;
    overdoing it. We pushed them forward.&#13;
&#13;
    ZENNI: How did your experience in India back then shape y our fut ure ideas on&#13;
    development?&#13;
&#13;
    HAMIL TON: I was a believer in foreign aid then. I have become less of a&#13;
    believer over the years as I look at countries that need it most, like Afric an&#13;
    countries, where I'm not sure about the impact. But I believ ed in foreign a id.&#13;
    My husband had been the staff director of the (Lester B.] Pearson Commission,&#13;
    which was put together to promote, rationalize, and justify foreign aid. My&#13;
    experience in India on I y confirmed m y belie f that foreign aid works.&#13;
&#13;
    ZENNI: Right. In August of '83, you moved to the East Asia and Pacific&#13;
    Region Country Program Department as chief of the Indonesia Division . Please&#13;
    describe the circumstances of yo ur move . Why did yo u go to East Asia,&#13;
    Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
    HAMILTON: I think the circumstances would best be described as a meat&#13;
    market. They were having a di v ision chief re ass ignment panel. It was a&#13;
    nightmare. It wasn't that I wanted to leave my position or that anybody&#13;
    particularly wanted me. It was that a number of di v ision chiefs who had been&#13;
    there for a long time or who .&#13;
&#13;
    ZENNI: Had to rotate?&#13;
&#13;
    HAMIL TON: Had to rotate, and the y were all put into a pool where it was a&#13;
    game of musical chairs . You went and tried to sell yo urself to the director of&#13;
    any department y ou could bear the idea of serving in. And certainly, of what&#13;
    was avai lab) e , Indonesia was my first choice. I was I ucky enough to get the&#13;
    Indonesia job.&#13;
&#13;
    ZENNI: What were your main responsibilities and what objectives did you set&#13;
    out to accomplish?&#13;

&#13;
HAMILTON: Remember, I arrived unenthusiastically . It wasn't that I ..&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Even though it was yo ur first choice?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes, but it was really my second choice because India was my&#13;
first choice. I didn't want to move, and the process , as I say, was I ike a slave&#13;
auction; it was horrible. When they have those reassignment panels, they 're just&#13;
terrible. I'm not sure there's a better way to do it, but it was terrible. So I was&#13;
agreeable, but not wildly enthusiastic.&#13;
&#13;
The Indonesia program was very unusual from its earliest days, from its origins&#13;
when Robert McNamara started the program in Indonesia and sent Bernie&#13;
[Bernard R.] Bell out as his man on Indonesia. Bernie didn't report to anybody&#13;
except McNamara; he reported directly to McNamara. The Indonesians knew it.&#13;
He became a very trusted advisor to the Indonesians. I remember his wife later&#13;
said to him , "Bernie, you are their magic amulet. The Indon esians trust&#13;
whatever you say." That situation set up a very special relationship with th e&#13;
field office. Washington was irrelevant to the Indonesia pro gram , and it had&#13;
remained largely irrelevant to the Indonesia program right up until my day. My&#13;
objective was simply to get along with the guy in the field, and for as long as I&#13;
was there the locus of power was in Jakarta. Happily, telephone and fax&#13;
communications were improving every single day. And everyday the economist&#13;
here , who was Mark Baird for most of my time , talked to Javed Khalilzadeh&#13;
Shirazi, the economist in Jakarta. And every day I talked to Lars Jeurling, who&#13;
was the loan officer there, and all we tried to do was make sure we we re talking&#13;
the same language. And whoever th e res rep was, whether it was Russ [Russe ll&#13;
J.) Cheetham or D.C. Rao, he called the shots.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How did th e Indonesia set-up impact polic y dialo gue?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Not at all. The Indonesians knew ho w to play the Bank's game&#13;
better than the Bank did.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Eve n in '83 when you took over? Because the field office was set up&#13;
back in '68.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Yes. T he lesson that I had lea rned was that my boss was in&#13;
Jakarta. I was ca lled division chief for both India and Indonesia, and both&#13;
countries are very smart about, title notwithst and in g, who's go t power, and who&#13;
can m ake things happen.&#13;
&#13;
It was why I was a successful se nior loan officer in India . They knew that I&#13;
co uld make things h appen, that I h ad enough influence with t h e po wers that be ,&#13;
so they respected me . When Jochen Kraske was out there , they liste ned t o him ,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
but they listened to me about as much. When other res reps were out there, the y&#13;
didn't listen to them at all. They listened mostly to me.&#13;
&#13;
And the same was true in Indonesia. They knew strength and the y knew&#13;
weakness when they saw it. And so, in Indonesia I didn't fig ht the situation.&#13;
The Bank always sent very strong representatives out there. It was a plum res&#13;
rep position, Jakarta was, and those guys were very strong an d very smart and&#13;
not worth jockeying for position with . I just helped them do whatever they&#13;
wanted to do. My capacity as division chief was like a bag carrier.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How did your previ,ous experience in India help you tackle         thos~&#13;
challenges?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: The challenges were pretty easy because I didn't do anything&#13;
except what I was told to do . Gautham Kaji was the department director at the&#13;
time, and he just said to me, " I'm keeping my hands off of Indonesia; I 'm not&#13;
managing Indonesia; Russ Cheetham or D.C. Rao is managing Indonesia." So&#13;
for me , in Washington, it was almost, as I say, a bag-carrying job .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How much of a factor was corruption at the time in Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: It cycled; it got worse during the period I was there. We knew it&#13;
existed. In my view, current fashion notwithstandin g, corruption exists&#13;
everywhere, low-lev e l corruption; junior, under-paid civil servants who take a&#13;
little something to do their job because it makes a difference. I don't object to&#13;
mild, low-level , chicken-feed corruption. I wa tched it get worse ove r time in&#13;
India.&#13;
&#13;
Indeed , another extremely interesting moment of my Indian career was w hen we&#13;
refused to declare a project effective because the main contract, which was a&#13;
condition of effectiveness, had been clearly let throu g h bribery and corrup t ion&#13;
and wasn't awarded to the best contractor. It was a power project.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Â· When was that, early '80s, late '80s ?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: It must have been in the mid or late '70s . The Indian&#13;
government argued their heads off. But David Hopper, bl ess his heart, stood&#13;
behind me and we refused to de c lare it effective. The project lap sed. Hundreds&#13;
of millions of dollars evaporated, and the Indians , w ho had officially argued as&#13;
hard as they kn ew how , later were very complimentary and fla ttering. They&#13;
were glad we had done it. As officials, they had to argue to hang on to $200&#13;
million, but they knew there was corruption, an d they knew th at it wo uld n ' t be a&#13;
good project, and they respected us for it , which was very, very nice.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Well, the same was kind of true in Indonesia. Corruption existed. Indonesia&#13;
was different in that it existed at very high levels. It was the president's family&#13;
and they did all kinds of evil things. But it wasn't bad enough to impact the&#13;
economy, the dialogue. It was just a certain proportion of the budget which was&#13;
wasted. It's true here in the U.S. It's true everywhere. Now, Indonesian&#13;
corruption got bad enough, I guess--or we got politically correct enough; I'm not&#13;
sure which--to start to make a great big issue out of it. It was probably some&#13;
combination because things did get very bad in Indonesia after my time. They&#13;
were sti II pretty much amateurs at it during my time. They just got greedier and&#13;
greedier, and it was basically the president's family and his huge interlocking&#13;
network of companies. They just went over the top.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And the Bank's role in that was ..&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: It was after my time . There were major issues between Dennis&#13;
De Tray, who was the rep out there then, and [James D.] Wolfensohn, fights&#13;
about corruption.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes, so that's then in the second half of the '90s.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Was it that late?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes, because Wolfensohn came in '95.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Yes. Up until then, we knew it, and we looked the other way&#13;
because we still had a lot to do by way of development and policy dialogue.&#13;
And policy still mattered. You couldn't let the tail of corruption wag the dog,&#13;
and maybe the tail got too big. I don't know whether our stiff-necked position&#13;
was justified or not.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Talking about decentralization and following through with your&#13;
discussion on the set-up in Indonesia where mostly the decision-makers were&#13;
actually in the resident mission , what are your views, in general, on the&#13;
advantages and disadvantages of decentralization in terms of bringing the Bank&#13;
closer to its clients? How do you see this?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well , I certainly see both sides. It certainly brings the Bank&#13;
closer to the client. It may bring the Bank too close to the client. It may mean&#13;
that there is no countervailing force, that all you do is what the client wants. In&#13;
Indonesi a, what those res reps --all of them, from Bernie Bell on--wa nted to do&#13;
was to keep the goodwill and trust of the Indonesians. That was the benchmark ,&#13;
not any other standard of performance. It was how much the Indon es ians liked&#13;
you , because if they didn't like you, you were frozen out and not allowed to&#13;
fully participate. That's a! ways true with resident missions and field offices.&#13;
The measure is how much does the borrower like them; if the govern ment&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
d-oesn't like the individuals in the field office, the Bank staff can't do anything&#13;
sitting there in the capital city not being invited to meetings and not having&#13;
anything happen. So there's a strong incentive to get along. On the other hand,&#13;
you're right there where the action is and you can follow what's going on in the&#13;
country much, much more closely.&#13;
&#13;
Another downside of decentralization is the cost, which is huge. And there is a&#13;
very big advantage to talking to your colleagues in Washington, exchanging&#13;
information, and learning about different things that are happening here.&#13;
There's nothing like face-to-face meetings with everybody involved with a&#13;
project all in the same city, Washington. Now, of course, communications have&#13;
improved so much now with teleconferencing, telephoning , and faxing;&#13;
everybody is walking around with a Blackberry, e-mailing, etcetera. It's a&#13;
different universe. You do have something close to conversation with&#13;
everybody . I, being old-fashioned, am still convinced that nothing beats a face-&#13;
to-face conversation, but the field people get back here often enough. The short&#13;
answer is, I think--this is not a short answer , this is a long answer--what I said&#13;
before: where is the strength and where is the weakness? And it doesn't matter&#13;
where it is in Washington or the field-very much because the government can&#13;
sense it, the interlocutors can sense it. And so, when you've got a strong&#13;
country director in the field, decentralization makes it easier for key people in&#13;
the country to talk to him. Where you've got a weak one , centralization is more&#13;
valuable than decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
I don't think there's a standard answer, nor do I think the answer is reall y based&#13;
on the merits. Once again it's one of those cases where it becomes fas hionable&#13;
to decentralize and all of a sudden everything is decentralized. I would much&#13;
rather have seen, as you say, an incremental approach. For example, in a&#13;
particular country, it might be better if there were more presence in the field&#13;
and less in Washington, but it's now universal, with all of its pros and cons.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well , the South Asia Region became the most d ece ntrali ze d regio n in&#13;
'97 , with some 66 percent of its staff located in the field.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: That's because Mieko went crazy. Mieko Nishimizu was th e hi g h&#13;
priestess of getting touchy-feely with the client.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Mieko says that this had started already before she came , that this w as&#13;
already in motion.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: She pushed it. She got religion , literally and figuratively. It&#13;
may have been slightly in motion. I have no doubt that there m ay ha ve b ee n&#13;
more pres e nce in the field than in pre vious yea rs , but she is th e one th at se nt&#13;
everybody out to sleep in a village--your ultimate decentrali za tion .&#13;

&#13;
ZENNI: While on the subject of Indonesia, the World Bank is a key member of&#13;
the Consultative Group , which groups together Indonesia's main foreign&#13;
creditors, and the same members also sit in the Paris Club as Indonesia's&#13;
sovereign creditors. Based on your experience, how would you assess the value-&#13;
added impact of the CGI [Consultative Group on Indonesia], as it is known, in&#13;
mobilizing resources and affecting general macroeconomic reforms?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Most of my answer to that question would be based on the India&#13;
Consortium, with which I had a lot more experience and which I understood a&#13;
lot better. For one thing , the Bank chaired the India Consortium. The&#13;
government of the Netherlands then, and I don't know who now, but it's not the&#13;
Bank that chaired the CGI, and it always met in the Netherlands . But all that&#13;
said, certainly for India, and almost certainly for Indonesia, the group performs&#13;
an extremely useful function in providing cover for the donors. It's easier for&#13;
them, for the aid agency of the Netherlands or France or wherever, to go back to&#13;
their Ministry of Finance and say, " We need money for this country because&#13;
everybody else is giving and here's how much they're giving and here's our&#13;
share."&#13;
&#13;
If you're part of a team, it's valuable to the aid agencies, and I'm sure helps&#13;
them to mobilize money. And it makes some difference in coordinating policies .&#13;
I rhean, if you've got somebody who's advocating something that everybody else&#13;
disagrees with, it's an opportunity to discuss it and argue it out.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: So there is value-added?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Oh, yes, I definitely think so.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Coming back to y ou , in September of ' 86 you received a grade&#13;
promotion whil e serving as chief of the Indonesia Division. Please discuss th e&#13;
circumstances leading to this, and what did it entail in terms of overall&#13;
responsibilities?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: I had forgotten about that. The answer to the second half of your&#13;
qu estion is that it didn't chan ge a thin g. The answer to the first half is that&#13;
there was a study made and somehow it was felt that some division chiefs were&#13;
more equal than oth e r division chiefs. Some countries were mor e important. I&#13;
guess that was it. Was it the size of the lending program? Was it the size of the&#13;
staff? Was it th e si z e o f the country ? And the big g ie s- -whi c h w e re India and&#13;
Brazil for sure , and I don't know who else--were clearly de e med worthy of&#13;
promotion, but I wasn ' t sure about Indonesia. I was worri e d that Indon e sia was&#13;
going to be right on the cusp and might not make the cut. And I rem e mb e r&#13;
making eloquent arguments for how important my job was and how burdensome&#13;
and how big the country was and how bi g my st a ff was , so that I could be on e o f&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the three or four division chiefs who were ranked higher than other division&#13;
chiefs.&#13;
&#13;
It's probably true that if you're a division chief with a 13-country department or&#13;
a division, as in some Central American or South Pacific units, you could&#13;
probably argue that the job is much harder, having to keep 13 countries straight&#13;
in your head, than mine having to keep only one country straight in my head.&#13;
But as long as they were coming up with a higher class of division chief, I sure&#13;
wanted to be in that class.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Was it reflective also of the size of the lending portfolio?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: I can't remember. I don't know what their criteria were. There&#13;
was a little task force that was doing that, and there was a lot of discussion&#13;
about it, and I don't really remember the details. Indeed, as I say, I'd forgotten&#13;
about it and I'd forgotten that I was one of the beneficiaries, although I do&#13;
remember wanting to benefit if this distinction was going to be made.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: You have worked in both South and East Asia. Based on that&#13;
experience, how did you at the time see the differences in economic&#13;
performance between these two regions where contrasts have been extreme?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: I guess you're talking about the Asian miracle of East Asia and&#13;
the sluggish performance of South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: The only explanations that I can come up with are: (a) culture.&#13;
You just can't beat the East Asian culture--the Chinese, Japanese , Vietnamese&#13;
culture--for achievement, striving, and hard work. One of my more striking&#13;
experiences was in Calcutta (I think it was there). Anyway, a Sites and Services&#13;
project which provided a cement slab, the sides of a house, maybe some walls&#13;
and some pi urn bing connections and maybe some electrical connections, and that&#13;
was it. And then you said to a family, you buy this slab for virtually no money&#13;
and now you have a home. The same thing, called a Kampung Improvement&#13;
Project, happened in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
In India, if you visit these projects, several years later, what you had were the&#13;
original concrete slabs with a tin roof over them and people surviving in them.&#13;
At least the rain wasn't falling on them anymore, but that was pretty much it.&#13;
By contrast, in Indonesia what you had were houses painted bright colors with&#13;
little white picket fences around them and flowers growing in front. It was&#13;
explained to me, and I came to believe it, that in India those terribly poor urban&#13;
dwellers lived in the after-life. There was so little hope here and now. It was&#13;
about survival. That was their strongest aspiration, just to survive and look&#13;
                                 Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
forward to something better in the next incarnation, Whereas in Indonesia,&#13;
typical of East Asia, it was here and now, making the best of it right here and&#13;
now, and it showed. That's just one manifestation of the cultural effect. So I&#13;
think culture has something to do with it.&#13;
&#13;
Another factor was much more pragmatic; it was what economic model they&#13;
were using. The Indians--and South Asians in general, but India was leading the&#13;
pack-used pretty much the Soviet central-planning, government-controlled&#13;
model, which looked very good in the '60s. But the y stuck w ith that model long&#13;
after its promise had faded, whereas the East Asians were ve ry quick to&#13;
recognize that the private sector profit motive was a good thing. And, indeed, it&#13;
was the basis of the East Asian miracle.&#13;
&#13;
The East Asian miracle has not been so miraculous lately, and South Asian&#13;
development has been miraculous. So things change, but back at that time, I'd&#13;
say the difference in economic performance was due to both culture and&#13;
economic approach .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: As part of that year's Bank reorganization in '87 under President&#13;
Conable, you were promoted to Director, Population and Human Resource&#13;
(PHR). Please discuss the circumstances leading to your promotion in taking on&#13;
a sector director position, and whether this was as a result of the reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: You will not be surprised to hear that the job that I wanted was&#13;
the job that was given to Bilsel Alisbah as India Country Director. In '87, I&#13;
wanted to be a country program director because that was where all the act io n&#13;
was, and especially India, but any other good country would have done the trick.&#13;
Instead, I got an area that I knew very little about, the social sectors. I did&#13;
know and had worked well with both David Hopper, who was the senior v ice&#13;
president, and V. [Visvanathan] Rajagopalan, who was vice president in charge&#13;
of the five sector departments. Hopper had five sector departments under&#13;
Rajagopalan and the Economics Dep a rtment under Ben King for a whi le and&#13;
then various other chief economists of the Bank. So both of those guys w ere&#13;
friends and longstanding colleagues of mine , and I got the job, I think, 98&#13;
percent because I was a woman and they felt they needed a woman. All the&#13;
other sector director positions were filled, all by men , not surprisingly. It's the&#13;
social sectors where women ha ve traditionally worked; yo u know , they're the&#13;
women's sectors. So that was where they thought to put a woman, and there I&#13;
was , a woman . I actually had a good friend who was working as an assistant,&#13;
sort of, to Hopper, and she said to me one day, "David has asked me to find a&#13;
Third World woman for that job."&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: For th e PHR Director job ?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Yes. And about three days later, I confessed to her: "I want you&#13;
to know I am your Third World woman." So, alas, they could not find the Third&#13;
World woman, so they had to settle for a first or second world woman.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And was this as a result of the reorganization?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay . What were your main responsibilities, and how did your&#13;
previous country focus experience in Asia help you tackle the challenges in&#13;
dealing with the social sectors?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Again, to answer the second half first, I don 't think my previous&#13;
country experience helped much at all. My previous management experience&#13;
helped. My previous experience in the Bank , in general, helped , knowing who&#13;
was who and what was where. But the fields were so different and the&#13;
approaches were so different.&#13;
&#13;
My responsibilities in those days were health, education, population, nutrition,&#13;
women in development, and poverty--poverty measurement, LSMS [Living&#13;
Standards Measurement Study], the microeconomic analytical unit. There were&#13;
four divisions in that department of which I was head. I had no expertise in any&#13;
of those fields; any of the fields that I just mentioned. What I was able to do&#13;
was (a) to gossip very widely about people, and thereby pick first-rate division&#13;
chiefs for the most part; I really got good people to run those divisions; and (b)&#13;
to empower them.&#13;
&#13;
Now, here was a case, quite the opposite of what I was talking about in the India&#13;
Division when I became division chief, here was a case where I could not do the&#13;
hands-on work directly. But what I could do was help the people who were&#13;
doing it and help them get their papers through and help them achieve their&#13;
objectives. For example, one of the more interesting papers we did was the&#13;
Bank's first policy paper on tobacco. It was very controversial bec a use the&#13;
United States, of course, was very tobacco-oriented and was ver y opposed to&#13;
any policy that said we won't lend for tobacco . And then there were tobacco-&#13;
growing countries that really needed the income. The farmers needed the&#13;
income from tobacco. The paper said no, the y just have to find something e Ise&#13;
to grow rather than murder.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Was this based on health reasons at the time?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes, health and the economic consequences of ill health. I t was&#13;
prepared by Howard Barnum in the Health Division, and we fou g ht it through ,&#13;
with a lot of help from Ernie Stern. He was for us and stood up to the U.S. ,&#13;
which was very hard. We fought through a paper on the health consequen c es of&#13;
                                  Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;
                            April 10, 2006 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
tobacco that said the Bank is not going to lend for tobacco growing or&#13;
processing, ever. And God knows I couldn't have written that paper, but what I&#13;
could do was help that division make it happen, get it through. So that's what I&#13;
was good at, and it has always amused me that I was made the director of that&#13;
department. It was then split into two departments with a vice president over it,&#13;
Armeane Choksi .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Later on?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Later, when I left, right. And then when Jean-Louis Sarbi b&#13;
arrived, it was made a senior vice presidency. I'd like to think that the job I did&#13;
as a woman director was given, unchanged, to a male vice-president and then&#13;
senior vice-president.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: The Human Development Network .&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes. My nice directorship has become very, very important.&#13;
don't think it has changed much. I just think the Bank has changed and the way&#13;
it works has changed. But there's another thing that might have contributed to&#13;
the way the situation developed. Maybe I dismissed my country experience too&#13;
readily, because what we were able to do was set up Bank-wide working groups.&#13;
We had enough contacts, and we were interested enough to relate to the regions,&#13;
to respect what the regions were doing, and set up working groups in health and&#13;
in education. And that became a model for the way the whole thing is done now.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: The way it evolved?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Right. I mean, what are today networks, we started them , a nd it&#13;
was not irrelevant that that was the way I had learned to work in the Bank and&#13;
that I did know an awful lot of people in an awful lot of regions.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, how would you describe, based on yo ur exper ience at that tim e,&#13;
the adequacy of the Bank's approach to the social sectors and their centrality to&#13;
poverty reduction?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: It was just then they were becoming important.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Was there a lot of focus on building national capacity at the time ?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, those guys at the center were very academic in th ei r&#13;
approach; it was like a little university there . We spent an awful lot of time at&#13;
meetings, at international me e tings, international conferences, discussing what&#13;
the latest trends in elementary education or in labor force development or in&#13;
nutrition were. We were the technical expertise that was generated and shared&#13;
at these meetings and th en was kind of fanned out to the re gi ons . It was the&#13;
                                 Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
regions who were responsible for developing country capacity, and we saw as&#13;
our job making them realize how important this stuff was and then developing&#13;
the country capacity. So we were two or three steps removed from building&#13;
country capacity, but it was certainly, in those early days, an important part of&#13;
our objectives.&#13;
&#13;
And then, of course, the priorities themselves shifted. I mean, for a while there,&#13;
women in development was a huge growth industry, and I think it may have&#13;
remained that. Population was a huge growth industry and has virtually&#13;
disappeared . Nutrition was a huge growth industry and has virtually&#13;
disappeared. One of the things that happened was Richard Feachem, who was&#13;
brought in as Health Director- I think that was his position-he was extremely&#13;
effective and strong-minded and powerful. And what used to be the PHN,&#13;
Population, Health . and Nutrition Division, or Department, in that order, went&#13;
into alphabetical order, Health, Nutrition and Population. And health was&#13;
primary and the other two became the poor Cinderella sectors for a while. They&#13;
may be coming back now, but they shrank a lot for a while.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: But during your time, it was PHR?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: The whole department was PHR. The division was PHN .&#13;
Women in Development, I think, has stayed, and Education has stayed important,&#13;
with I'm not sure what impact nor if it is very measurable. The Poverty unit has&#13;
moved out.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Please discuss your contribution to the issues of women in&#13;
development. And how would you assess the effectiveness of Bank efforts in&#13;
mainstreaming gender issues in poverty reduction strategies at that time?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: When I took over that job, I inherited Barbara Herz. There was a&#13;
tiny Women in Development (WID) unit somewhere and it was pulled into this&#13;
PHR department, and Barbara came along with it as division chief. Barbara was&#13;
extremely effective in promoting women's issues, and she had two great allies in&#13;
this whom she carefully cultivated, and made it work. The first was Charlotte&#13;
Conable, Barber Conable's. wife, whom she befriended, and used her actively to&#13;
have women's issues raised all the time, in every single context. And when&#13;
Barber Conable spoke, people listened . She tried again with Patsy Preston, but&#13;
Mrs. Preston was not quite as engaged as Mrs . Conable, who was a major ally.&#13;
And the other person that was her big ally was Larry [Lawrence H.] Summers ,&#13;
and he made a really seminal speech on girls' education in Pakistan. I can't&#13;
even remember where he made it, but I know that Barbara and her whole team&#13;
worked on it for months because Larry wanted it.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: When he was the Chief Economist at the time?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Yes. And the speech set the audience and the world on its ears.&#13;
So what I could do was give Barbara free rein, empower her, support her, and let&#13;
her run around driving people crazy pushing gender issues, and it worked.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Still on the subject of women in development, how would you assess&#13;
the effectiveness of Bank efforts in mainstreaming gender issues in povert y&#13;
reduction strategies at that time? And we are talking about the late '80s .&#13;
&#13;
  HAMILTON: Well, 1 would certainly say it was very effective. I'm not sure&#13;
  how much credit the Bank gets, but they certainly get some . I think the&#13;
  pendulum was swinging then, as it had swung in this country maybe a decade&#13;
  earlier. Schools were beginning to recognize that admitting women was&#13;
  advantageous. The glass ceiling was being broken, exactly like when David&#13;
  Hopper appointed me because I was a woman. You know, diversity was&#13;
  becoming important, and in those days that meant gender diversity to a very&#13;
  large degree. It was happening increasingly all over the world (a) for poli t ically&#13;
  correct reasons and (b) for substantive reasons, as in Larry Summers' speech. I&#13;
  mean, 50 percent of the population is women . They are hugely important to the&#13;
  economy. Making them more productive and effective makes a huge difference.&#13;
  And that was the message that Barbara Herz was selling to anybod y that would&#13;
Â· listen. Countries were ready to listen; governments were ready to listen . Larry&#13;
  Summers was a wonderful advocate. So what with one thing and another, it was&#13;
  happening for many reasons, but the Bank was part of those reasons. I mean,&#13;
  Preston or Conable, I forget which one, and probably both, even went too far&#13;
  sometimes, requiring a paragraph in every appraisal report about the role of&#13;
  women. Well, maybe you had to bend over backwards in order to get it&#13;
  integrated.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Mainstreamed?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Mainstreamed , yes, exactly. So, yes , the Bank made a difference.&#13;
The Bank was not single- handedly the source of the chan g e, but definitely a part&#13;
of the change.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: And that impacted your work and your contribution?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, as 1 say, our job was simply to lean on the regions to&#13;
incorporate this in the policy dialogue. My work was simpl y to empower m y&#13;
own advocates to go out there and advocate and to support them and to facilitate&#13;
their work.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: More generally , what, in your view, has proved most effective in&#13;
helping g ive women a voice in society and in empowerin g th e ir ro le in th e&#13;
development process?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, the most obvious answer to me is education. Girls'&#13;
education is of huge and overwhelming importance, the most important single&#13;
thing, but it's not the only thing. Going way back, I remember in India when&#13;
they had a tube well for drinking water in the village. If the tube well broke,&#13;
there was no water for the whole village. You called the water authority and&#13;
within a week or two somebody would come to fix the tube well. But in the&#13;
meanwhile, the whole village was without water and women had to walk miles&#13;
to get water from a polluted stream and carry it home on their heads. Then&#13;
somebody started a program--not the World Bank--in which village women were&#13;
given a bicycle and trained in how to repair a tube well; a very simple&#13;
mechanism, three moving parts or something. They took these young women&#13;
from the village and gave them each a bicycle and a tool kit and a training&#13;
program. These women who had never left their own village because they had&#13;
no way to go, they had no reason to go, suddenly became hugely empowered.&#13;
They had a job to do. If the tube well broke, you radioed them and they were&#13;
there within an hour and the tube well was fixed. Each woman worked in maybe&#13;
a 10-mile radius, which was I 0 miles further than she had ever been in her life,&#13;
peddling up on a bicycle. Those women were so proud and so happy. They&#13;
were not educated, but they were given a job to do and they did it beautifully.&#13;
&#13;
So it is education above all, because that affects not only the women but the&#13;
children of the women, the next generation. It's your multiplier effect beyond&#13;
measure. In addition, there is a growing realization that women can be useful,&#13;
effective and productive. So it's society plus education. And the education&#13;
thing has for sure caught on. Now women are being educated to a much higher&#13;
degree.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Moving on to NGOs [non-governmental organizations], based on your&#13;
experience what is your assessment of the burgeoning number of NGOs at that&#13;
time and their increasing engagement in the development process, especially, in&#13;
the social and rural sectors, and what was your contribution to Bank-NGO&#13;
dialogue?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: That also happened in two parts, and I won't talk about the&#13;
second part which happened later, on my return to South Asia. There are two&#13;
kinds of NGOs. One are those small groups that are trying to do good in-&#13;
country, as distinct from international NGOs who are trying to do good on a&#13;
larger scale, or at least to make a name for themselves.&#13;
&#13;
The small ones come in two forms themselves, good ones and bad ones, and the&#13;
biggest challenge is distinguishing between those that are effective and good&#13;
and those that aren't. The more we worked with them, the better we understood&#13;
the difference. It's one thing when the Bank is working in infrastructure and&#13;
you're talking to the railway authority or the highway authority or the fertili z er&#13;
company; that's an easy form of dialogue. But if you're trying to deal with&#13;
                                   Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
social change, you can't do it from here and you can't even do it from the capital&#13;
city of the country, so we need those NGOs very, very much. They're the ones&#13;
in the villages who know what's going on and who know what's needed and who&#13;
know what makes a difference. Most of our choices were good. That's partly&#13;
because most of the NGOs that had the sense to start a dialogue with the World&#13;
Bank were already fairly sophisticated and knew what they were doing. And&#13;
there are an awful lot of people out there in the private sector in any donor&#13;
country who know the NGO world, and we learned how to work with them. So&#13;
the answer is they played an evermore important role.&#13;
&#13;
We also took great advantage of a grants program--which later, after my time,&#13;
the Bank discovered was run in a helter-skelter way, no standards, no control,&#13;
no nothing-under which you could write a little proposal and get grant money&#13;
from wherever it sat in the Bank and give it to a promising NGO. And we were&#13;
way ahead of that curve. We discovered this money early and gave lots of&#13;
money--not big grants, just small ones--to lots of outfits to whom $50,000 is a&#13;
fortune; it's their whole annual budget. And we learned how to use that money&#13;
well before the Bank discovered we were doing it in a sort of informal way. It&#13;
reminds me of when Wolfensohn used to meet somebod y he liked on his travels&#13;
and he would give them money from his own private foundation. Well, this was&#13;
our own private foundation. We gave a lot of key seed money to NGOs, and we&#13;
worked closely with them, and usefully.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: You've already spoken about institutional reform, but I'd like to ask&#13;
you spec i fica! I y, in your view, what impact did the '87 reorganization have on&#13;
the institution in terms of staff morale, goals achieved, and long-term impact on&#13;
Bank strategy and objectives? And, what, in your opinion, should be the main&#13;
drivers for undertaking periodic institutional reforms?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: The '87 one was done by Conable, wasn't it?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, I've made clear my impatience with very broad-scale,&#13;
across-the-board reorganization almost for its own sak e, for the ego&#13;
gratification of the president who can then prove that he has made a change,&#13;
coming in and doin g things be tter. The '87 one I always be lieved had one&#13;
hidden primary agenda, which was to de-fang Ernie Stern, to disempower him;&#13;
he was g etting to be too important. He was the Bank; he was running the Bank.&#13;
But a Bank-wide reorganization is a hugely disruptive way to deal with one&#13;
p e rson. It wasn't an explicit obj e ctiv e , but it c e rtainly was a key part of th e&#13;
ag enda. It didn't work, of course , because he was effective enough that no&#13;
matter what position he was in, he was going to run the Bank as long as he was&#13;
he re . It Â·would hav e be en easi e r to ask him to le av e th a n to reorgani ze th e whol e&#13;
Bank around him.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In a funny way, setting up the center was a lot like going way back to the '72&#13;
reorganization, or whenever the Programs and Projects Departments were&#13;
combined in the regions. The center was similar to the old Projects Department ,&#13;
but it wasn't regionally organized or country-focused. In sum, the&#13;
reorganization was disruptive, and it cheapened the currency by promoting&#13;
everybody. All of a sudden there were 35 vice presidents. Back in the olden&#13;
days, you know, it was an honored title. I'm sure the country focus element of it&#13;
in the regions was important and valuable. There always are important and&#13;
valuable parts of any reorganization. It's just that the reorganizations become&#13;
so much bigger than they need to be (a) because once you start this snowball&#13;
rolling down the hill, it gets very big by the time it reaches the bottom; and (b)&#13;
because of the ego implications for both the president and the task force that he&#13;
set up to do it. I'm all for incrementalism. But nobody has asked me how to&#13;
reorganize the Bank. So I think '87 was just another example of losing a year&#13;
and then Bank staff figure out how to do their work again. It's the same old&#13;
pattern; you stir it up and it settles back down.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What, in your opinion, should be the main drivers for undertaking&#13;
periodic institutional reforms?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, first of all, you have to find a problem. If you have a&#13;
problem, you address it. That's the easy way of doing a reform. But you do not&#13;
need to bring the entire Bank into the process, to turn it upside down to solve&#13;
one or two problems. If things aren't going well in country X, we should&#13;
decentralize there by all means, but that doesn't mean you have to decentralize&#13;
everywhere . Or if you need to deal with a few vice presidents who aren't being&#13;
as effective as you'd like, you don't need to make them managing directors and&#13;
appoint new vice presidents in their place . You need to deal with those&#13;
individuals in a highly individualized way. So, one driver is problem-solving;&#13;
another is that from time to time some change is probably healthy. It's very&#13;
disruptive, but it's probably healthy. Still, it should be moderate, not just&#13;
change for its own sake . So there's something to be said for change, and there's&#13;
something to be said for discussion of change, too. I mean , I do not mind a&#13;
bunch of focus groups on how does your unit work and how could it work better,&#13;
but I don't agree with doing it by setting up a task force , which is again nothing&#13;
but a group of individuals brin g ing their own individual biases and exp e riences,&#13;
and all of a sudden it is a zillion-dollar thing. I also sometimes think it 's just to&#13;
keep that moving company in business as we reorganize and every body has to&#13;
move offices. But on the whole, I've never met a reorgani z ation that I liked.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: In January of '93 , you returned to the South Asia Region as Director,&#13;
C ountry Department I, and you can te ll us specifically wh a t countries th at&#13;
represented. What prompted your return to a country focus, and what were the&#13;
main areas you focused on in tackling the ov e rwhelming ch a llenges of a region&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
that is home to the largest number of the world's poor, most of whom are&#13;
women?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: The reason I left was because my job was given away. Wasn't&#13;
there another reorganization?&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Are we talking perhaps about the fine-tuning exercise/mini&#13;
reorganization in Octoter'92 where the VP, Sector &amp; Operations Policy, was&#13;
replaced with three new vice presidencies along thematic lines: Human&#13;
Resources Development and Operations Policy (Armeane Choksi); Finance and&#13;
Private Sector Development (Jean-Francois Rischard); and Environmentally&#13;
Sustainable Development (Ismail Serageldin)?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: All I remember is I was on vacation in Turkey when I got a&#13;
phone call.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Was it '92, because you moved in January of '93?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Then yes, it would be summer/fall of '92. I got a phone call&#13;
from my office saying, "Uh-oh, your job has been abolished; it has been&#13;
transformed into two jobs and all sorts of things have happened, so come home&#13;
and see what's going on."&#13;
&#13;
Armeane Choksi was made vice president for whatever it was called, but PHR is&#13;
the way I still think about it. At that point, I was talking to him about&#13;
remaining a director of half of my former empire, either the education half or&#13;
the health half. To be handling only half of it -would have been quite a come-&#13;
down since I'd been handling it all, but that was okay. That would have been an&#13;
acceptable job, but I also began exploring what was available in country&#13;
departments, and the most promising vacancy was in South Asia, since Jochen&#13;
Kraske had just been selected to be Bank Historian. I knew his job was&#13;
becoming vacant, and I approached Joe [D. Joseph] Wood about it and&#13;
ultimately got it.&#13;
&#13;
So it was a mixture of basically being pushed out, gently squeezed out by are-&#13;
organization, not wanting to have a job that was half of my former job, and the&#13;
pull of my old stomping ground in country operations. And I loved South Asia,&#13;
even though the countries involved were the smaller ones--Bangladesh, Nepal&#13;
and Bhutan. Bangladesh and Nepal are, of course, like African countries in&#13;
terms of their poverty. They are small, poor, developmentally-challenged&#13;
countries, and Bhutan was just a little gem that sat up there in the mountains&#13;
and did its own thing. So it was indeed challenging . And, of course, when you&#13;
come into countries that you don't know, it takes a good year to establish the&#13;
relationships, to learn the issues, to discuss the projects. There were res reps in&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
both countries who had been there for a while and who were very helpful in&#13;
showing me the ropes and getting me up to speed, but it tooka lot of learning.&#13;
&#13;
Once again, I had a very good staff who had been there for the most part longer&#13;
than I had, and I was very proud of the appointments I made during that period&#13;
because I brought an awful lot of very good people into the department which&#13;
also made a very big difference.&#13;
&#13;
Bangladesh turned out to be, for me, a huge surprise. It was a very smart and&#13;
effective government that nobody appreciated much, including me. It is the&#13;
home of the Grameen Bank, and it was the home of the best educational&#13;
experiment going on probably in the world. The smart and wise Bangladeshis&#13;
were right on the cutting edge of everything, and they were willing to try things&#13;
and they were cooperative. So it was great fun to work on Bangladesh and to&#13;
learn about it.&#13;
&#13;
For most of the time that I worked on Nepal, the big issue was the Arun&#13;
hydroelectric project, which was a very separate issue, but&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: We'll come back to that later.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Okay. On the whole, once again the countries were doing it, not&#13;
the Bank. Bangladesh was educating girls, was setting up micro enterprises; it&#13;
was the model for the world in these fields. So it was pretty exciting just to get&#13;
to know them. In fact, once again, the Grameen Bank and its leadership didn't&#13;
want us involved. It was like oil in India--they were doing just fine, thank you-&#13;
-and a lot of donors who came in with a much lighter touch than the World Bank&#13;
were supporting them. They didn't particularly want the World Bank in their&#13;
business , but we wanted in really bad, and so gradually we made a marriage.&#13;
They still kept us pretty much at arms length because they didn't want us telling&#13;
them what to do. They knew how to do it and they didn't want us improving&#13;
their modus operandi. Those were fun countries to discover as I did.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: As country director, how instrumental, in yo ur view, is effective&#13;
coordination and collaboration with the regional banks--in your case, it would&#13;
be the Asian Development Bank--how would yo u describe the Bank's efforts, in&#13;
general, and what was your contribution?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: I think it' s very important that we cooperate with them. The&#13;
conventional wisdom in my day with all the regional banks, but certainly the&#13;
Asian Development Bank, which is one of the best, is that they were really&#13;
stupid and we were reall y smart. Our job was to keep them out so we could go&#13;
in and save the day because if they did it, th ey' d do it wrong.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: No partnering with them?&#13;
                                 Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Not enough, not nearly enough, but gradually we began to&#13;
communicate better with them, and to accept them. I was really quite merciless&#13;
with my own staff, who said we've got to keep them out of the education&#13;
business in Bangladesh because we're doing it better. I said no, you have to&#13;
bring them in and work with them. It was very hard because it required a&#13;
culture shift inside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank wants to be--I'd better not speak in the present tense because I'm&#13;
really too out of touch--wanted to be, in my entire experience, numero uno in&#13;
everything, everywhere, all the time. We were better and therefore we should&#13;
do it all. They never learned about comparative advantage. And it required a&#13;
lot of, as I say, culture change to persuade the staff to cooperate. Now, it also&#13;
happened--in Bangladesh, in particular--that we undertook some very good in-&#13;
country coordination exercises which also helped improve communications and&#13;
partnering, but it was not the done thing. And that's the lesson I would take&#13;
home: let the regional banks and other donors do and get good at what they're&#13;
best at, let them have some piece of the action, leadership. Let the ADB, for&#13;
example, have the lead in the power sector or the education sector.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes, recognize the expertise of others.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: And we can work with them. Instead of just competition, it&#13;
should be cooperation. But that was not always the case. I hope it has gotten&#13;
better.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: I think it has to some extent.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: We had one Bank staff member, a Japanese woman, who had&#13;
gone to the Asian Development Bank on a temporary assignment. I can't&#13;
remember her name, but she was there and that made dialogue a lot easier. She&#13;
was like a department director at the Asian Development Bank. I never knew&#13;
her well, but the staff found her easy to work with because she was one of us&#13;
and therefore had to be okay.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Sometime in '93, you served as Chairman of the Appeals Committee.&#13;
Do you care to discuss how this came about?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: I had been a member of the Appeals Committee for several years.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Prior to ..&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: '93 . I don't remember when I joined, but I had been a member&#13;
for three or four years before I became Chair. Bilsel Alisbah, who had been&#13;
Chair of the Appeals Committee, moved from his job as India Country Director&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
to the head of Personnel. It was obviously impossible for the head of the&#13;
Personnel Department to be on the Appeals Committee as well, since that would&#13;
be the ultimate self-dealing. So he arranged--! think it was pretty much wi thin&#13;
his power--he made me Chairman, or he told them to make me Ch ai rman , w hich&#13;
is how it happened. It was his promotion that made it happen . I remember&#13;
saying, "Bilsel, when I told you I wanted your job , I didn't m ean you r job o n the&#13;
Appeals Committee, I meant your job as head of the . India Department. " But I&#13;
got the Appeals Committee job instead. Once again , I ha v e not followed w hat&#13;
has happened to the Appeals Committee or how it has evolved, but it was an&#13;
extremely interesting position and situation. And once again, in 90 percent of&#13;
the cases that we got, all we had to do was listen to the appellant, because the&#13;
problem was they felt aggrieved and nobody had ever listened to their side of&#13;
the story. Even when we decided against them, they were, as a rule , grateful&#13;
and relieved that somebody had just spent a whole day or sometimes two days&#13;
listening to what they thought was wrong and was ha v ing a dialogue with them&#13;
about it. And it was just very humanitarian. One of the things it taught me was&#13;
how non-humanitarian so many of the Bank's personnel decisions are. You just&#13;
say, "We're sorry, you're not performing well, you're going to get no r a ise this&#13;
year or ever again," or " You're going to be gi v en a more menial job, end of&#13;
story." There has been no, as I say, discussion, no listening .&#13;
&#13;
Most people are so glad to just have somebody hear what they' ve got to sa y&#13;
about something and care about what they've got to say about something. I&#13;
couldn't give you a tally of how many of the Appeals Committee's&#13;
recommendations were in support of the Bank's position and how many in&#13;
support of the appellant's position and, when in support of the appellant's&#13;
position , how many times did the Bank take its advice, because it's only&#13;
advisory. I found it a really enlightening, interestin g and fun job to do. It was&#13;
hard work but it was well worth it.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Is there value-added in having such a mechanism for the institution ?&#13;
You've spoken of the va lue in terms of the staff hav in g someone to l ist en to&#13;
their grievances , but for the Bank, does the Bank itself benefit from ha v ing such&#13;
a mechanism in terms of learning from it?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Maybe yes and maybe no. The Bank benefits becau se if yo u&#13;
listen to people and let them ventilate and walk away, feeling at least a little&#13;
better about their situation, the y 're much less likely to be disruptive, litigious,&#13;
difficult, trouble-makers or whatever. So, yes, it's certainly worth it from t h at&#13;
point of view. Do es it c han ge the Bank's modus operandi? Â·I think that's highly&#13;
personal. If you've got a grumpy martinet of a boss , then he's going to make a&#13;
staff member unhappy. And if the staff memb e r appeals to his boss, who is&#13;
gr umpy and busy and doesn't have time to list e n to whiners , th e problem is not&#13;
going to be solved. If you have a nice guy lik e Bilsel Alisbah as Director of&#13;
Personnel , he's going to list e n to both sid es of the story . If you don't h ave a&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
nice guy as Director of Personnel, he's going to be imperious. So it's not the&#13;
Bank learning from the Appeals Committee, it's the Bank learning about what&#13;
individuals to appoint as managers.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: So there were some lessons learned from some of these deliberations?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: We didn't try to draw broad conclusions. There was a secretariat&#13;
that did an annual report, but I'm not sure it tried to come up with major lessons.&#13;
It would be really interesting to have an evaluation of the Appeals Committee&#13;
and its impact on the Institution as well as on individual cases. I don't even&#13;
know what the appeals structure is now. In those days, it was the Appeals&#13;
Committee and whatever the .&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Tribunal.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes, exactly. We were advisory and they were mandatory. But&#13;
they listened to us, which was very, very helpful. And most of our cases--at&#13;
least most of my cases, I'm happy to say--did not go fo" rward to the Tribuna I.&#13;
The staff member either left happy or at least recognized that they didn't have a&#13;
chance because we had really tried hard to listen to their point of vi ew and&#13;
found it unconvincing . Then, of course, there was the Ombudsman, which is&#13;
another place where people listen.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Yes, exactly. There are many areas where staff have recourse in the&#13;
Bank, I have to say.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Yes, and I think it's worth it for sure, because if you bottle it up,&#13;
it just spills out somewhere else.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Now we can discuss your involvement on the Arun III Hydroelectric&#13;
Project, including the reasons why you think this project ended up being&#13;
investigated by the n ewly-established Inspection Panel in '94- it was the&#13;
Panel's first project--resulting in the Bank's eventual withdrawal from the&#13;
project in '95.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: That was surely one of the worst chapters of my Bank experience.&#13;
When I joined the Bangladesh-Nepal-Bhutan department, there were two&#13;
projects in the pipeline--one was the Jamuna Bridge in Bangladesh, and one was&#13;
the Arun III project in Nepa--that were attracting a great de a l of ne ga ti ve&#13;
attention. The detractors were mostl y staff inside the department, mostl y the&#13;
social sector people who could not bear the idea of having these huge sums of&#13;
money spent on big infrastructure projects. That was the zenith of t he social&#13;
sectors and th e nadir of infrastructure projects, and these were both very bi g&#13;
infrastructure projects.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Jamuna Bridge project went forward in spite of an enormous amount of&#13;
carping from all over the place, all over the Bank. But we fought our way to the&#13;
Board and it went through, and it has been, I'm told, one of the most successful&#13;
projects in the history of Bangladesh. It crosses the Jamuna River, which is a&#13;
huge river, and it has vastly facilitated transport; truck drivers can now go in a&#13;
day someplace, whereas it took them ten days before because they had to drive&#13;
all the way around. It was important and it was technically challenging and it&#13;
was a great success. I made it clear earlier that I'm a believer in infrastructure&#13;
projects, and this was a successful one.&#13;
&#13;
Â· ZENNI: What year are we talking about?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Well, one of the very few years that I was in that department, so&#13;
it probably went forward in '94, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: On Arun, your question suggests that the project did not achieve&#13;
its objectives. The project was never done . It never went forward. My&#13;
explanation for that goes back to the infamous Narmada project in India, in&#13;
which several international NGOs became very excited about the number of&#13;
people that would be displaced by building this large dam to irrigate a large area.&#13;
And to their own amazement and mine and the Bank's, they prevailed . It&#13;
became so controversial that the Bank finally said to the government of India,&#13;
"Please withdraw this project. You can find funding elsewhere. We will help&#13;
you find funding elsewhere. It's a good project, but we can't afford to do it."&#13;
And the NGOs were simply delighted and surprised, as I say, that they had&#13;
managed to actually stop a Bank project. I don't think they expected success,&#13;
but they got it.&#13;
&#13;
And so then they looked around the world to see what they could oppose next ,&#13;
since this was fun, parading and demonstrating in Washington and having&#13;
meetings and all that. Well, right next door was the Arun Hydroelectric Project,&#13;
so all the big, noisy international NGOs focused on that project. Then we also&#13;
had inside the department a guy, Martin Karcher, who was Division Chief for&#13;
the social sectors, the Population, Health and Nutrition Division inside the&#13;
department. He. became a one-m a n crusader against the project , and he aroused&#13;
a lot of interest. Thousands of questions were raised, which was helpful.&#13;
Thousands of qu e stions were answered to my complete satisfaction.&#13;
&#13;
In fact, it was a good process because the project was very dicey. This was a&#13;
big and tricky project in a small and institutionally weak country, but it was so&#13;
important. It would have made such a difference to the future of Nepal that I&#13;
wa s very anxious to have it done. We all knew that it was very, very high-risk,&#13;
and we did everything in our power to analyze things, to set up safeguards. We&#13;
                                 Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                 32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
did everything we knew how to increase the chances of success of the project. I&#13;
had several very good meetings with the Inspection Panel members. We had a&#13;
good dialogue going. Sometime in there, the following things happened. One,&#13;
the NGOs were so very busy. They were helped by the fact that Martin Karcher&#13;
retired from the Bank, having reached the rule of 85 or whatever, but he did it&#13;
with a huge fanfare saying that he was resigning over the Arun project, which&#13;
really infuriated me because it was not true. It was a standard retirement at the&#13;
standard time, but he made a lot of noise about linking it to Arun.&#13;
&#13;
Two, Ernie Stern left, and he was one of the people, like with the tobacco paper&#13;
that I mentioned earlier, who was prepared to stand up to pressure if he thought&#13;
it was the right thing to do. With Ernie up top and me down below, we kept the&#13;
pressure on Joe Wood, the vice president, who was for the project but was a&#13;
little scared. It was being attacked from all sides. Ernie left, and not very long&#13;
after that, I left.&#13;
&#13;
The third thing that happened was that Jim Wolfensohn, who wanted to be&#13;
everybody's best friend, especially the NGOs ' best friend, came in. Without&#13;
Ernie and without me, he and Joe Wood dropped the project.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Wolfensohn came in June of '95.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: The project was dropped sometime early in his tenure, probably&#13;
later in '95.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: In '94 the Inspection Panel came out with a report that asked for&#13;
a lot of additional work . It didn't damn the project. It just said there are a lot&#13;
of risks here and you've got to be very , very careful. So we did more work. We&#13;
just kept working and working. That project took a hundred perc ent of my time&#13;
for a year because I thought it was important. But by late '95, when&#13;
Wolfensohn pulled the plug on it, I had left , Ernie had left , the NGOs were on&#13;
the warpath , th e Inspection Panel report was not good. Everything conspired to&#13;
scuttle the project.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Overall, the findings seem to indicate that IDA management's overall&#13;
performance was deficient , there was non-compliance with its own operational&#13;
directives.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: I don't think so. As I recall , this was all about whether the&#13;
gove rnment of Nepal could actually implement something this complicated and .&#13;
with this much social sensitivity. They were messing with the high Himalayas&#13;
up there. It was not about our operational directives ; it was about: what we re&#13;
the odds that th e government of Nepal would implement the project the way we&#13;
said they were going to?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: How crucial was the staff appraisal report in this context, based on&#13;
your extensive experience in doing appraisals?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: It was as good as it could be. We had done everything possible .&#13;
It was excellent, but it didn't carry the day. We said, "There's a risk here; here's&#13;
how we're handling it. There's a risk there, here's how we're handling it." And&#13;
it just wasn't good enough for all those people who say, "You can't handle those&#13;
risks; the government of Nepal is not competent."&#13;
&#13;
Now, the reason I mentioned the Jamuna Bridge is because they said the same&#13;
thing, and yet it was a great success. And I am convinced to this day that had&#13;
we gone ahead with the Arun project, it would have made a huge difference in&#13;
Nepal's economic development.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: In your view, what should be the lessons learned for the Bank in its&#13;
approach to building large hydroelectric dams which have been, for the most&#13;
part, such highly controversial undertakings for the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, you either say it's not worth it; they take so much time and&#13;
energy because of the controversy that we just won't do large hydroelectric&#13;
projects . Large hydroelectric projects (a) are technically complicated and&#13;
challenging and (b) involve moving people, and moving people is difficult and&#13;
challenging. And that's where the controversy comes in, largely. So either you&#13;
run away and let others finance the projects, or you stay in the game.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What does that say about the Bank's resettlement policies?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: I'm not sure what they are today. In my day, especially in&#13;
Indonesia, there were huge resettlement projects that we were financing.&#13;
They're complica~ed, you know, but something like them needs to be done in the&#13;
name of development and of progress. I'm reminded for no particular reason of&#13;
the controversy going on in this country now about immigration policy and&#13;
immigration laws. That's people moving around and adjusting to a new society&#13;
and a new way of life. Of course, it's not happy-making for anybody, but it's a&#13;
problem that has to be addressed one way or the other. Either you build a fe nce&#13;
or you make immigration work. In that sense it is like a hydroelectric project.&#13;
Either you do the best you can in a com pi ica ted and difficult situation, or yo u&#13;
say, "Well, let somebody else do that. It is perfect for the Asian Development&#13;
Bank, don't you think?" "No, because they don't want it either." So what do&#13;
you do about hydroelectric projects ? I don't know the answer.&#13;
&#13;
I myself would fight because I'm a fighter. I like a good fi g ht, but the rug was&#13;
pulled out from under me after my departure. It was one of the saddest days of&#13;
my life when we walked away, when Wolfensohn and Joe Wood decided to drop&#13;
the Arun III project. I'm not even sure when it was.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: It was in August '95 that the Bank withdrew from the project.&#13;
&#13;
We turn now to discussing the institutional reforms that took place within the&#13;
Asia Department around this time, mainly, the consolidation of three country&#13;
departments into two. In your view, why were these reforms institutionally&#13;
necessary, and how did they affect you professionally?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: They affected me pretty profoundly. I think they were not&#13;
necessary. I think they were wrong. I think they were a mistake.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: What do you think drove this?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: Joe Wood, the vice president, did it on his own. My own view is&#13;
that it was at least partly because he thought that's what Shahid Husain wanted,&#13;
although he swore that Shahid 's views did not motivate him.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Shahid Husain at that time was VP of Personnel?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes. And he thought that's what Jim Wolfensohn would want.&#13;
think Shahid was playing the Wolfensohn card pretty hard.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: We're still in late '94 here.&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes, but Wolfensohn, I think, was already a factor, long before&#13;
he actually took office. I think Shahid, for sure, was part of Joe's motivation.&#13;
And I think part of it was I made him very anxious and very nervous.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Made Joe Wood?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes . He did not know how to handle an outspoken woman very&#13;
well. A third factor -- and least important in my thinking--was, I believe, Joe&#13;
actually thought for some crazy reason that it would be more efficient. The&#13;
workload of these departments was erratic. Sometimes there was a lot of&#13;
lending and sometimes there was a lot less. Obviously, if you combine more&#13;
countries together you get more diversification and more evenness of lending,&#13;
and he thought that was a value to be achieved. I argued that he shouldn't take&#13;
the poor country department, namely Bangladesh and Nepal, and combine it with&#13;
the big, successful or quasi-successful countries, the giant countries , namely&#13;
India and Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
I also pointed out to Joe, when arguing against this, that he is destroying his&#13;
own future because a two-department vice presidency isn't enough critical mass&#13;
to keep him in business, that no matter what Shahid thinks he should keep three&#13;
departments. The other two directors argued the same thing, but he was&#13;
                                  Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;
                            April 10, 2006 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
determined. He abolished one department and that left, as I alwa ys put it, t hree&#13;
frogs and two lily pads. It was a game of musical chairs in which they had&#13;
taken away a chair.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there was never a moment's doubt in my mind about which directors were&#13;
going to be kept on. There was never a moment's doubt that it was going to be&#13;
me that ended up without a chair, because I knew he wasn't comfortable wi th me.&#13;
I believe this was partly because I kept holding his feet to the fire on Arun and&#13;
he didn't like having to take all this heat on Arun. But, anyway, there I was, out&#13;
of a job , and that was, from my point of view, officially the end. It was right&#13;
after the Madrid annual meeting in September'94 that he announced this change.&#13;
I had a nice time in Madrid, good discussions with everybody, a classic, good&#13;
annual meeting, but by October the bottom had fallen out of my world . That&#13;
meant also this ghastly process of making sure that all your staff end up&#13;
somewhere. A whole department's worth of staff had, in effect, lost their jobs.&#13;
Where were they going to go? Which department were they going to go to?&#13;
How did you persuade that department director to take this staff member w hom&#13;
he didn't know and didn ' t want ? So what was going to happen to this poor guy&#13;
hanging out there? None of that had, of course, been thought through. This is&#13;
the kind of reorganization stuff that I think is terrible because it just was so&#13;
horrible for morale.&#13;
&#13;
So in January'95 , I was made an adviser on governance. That was my portfolio.&#13;
I knew nothing about it. I didn't want to know anything about it. I didn't care&#13;
about it, and so I began looking around. I devoted all my time to looking for&#13;
another job. It was Wilfried Thalwitz, bless his heart, who said, " Don't take&#13;
another job. You will never have another chance like this at a severance&#13;
package. Leave." So I devoted the next little while to (a) still looking for&#13;
another job, but also (b) leaving and negotiating a severance package.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Later, in January '96 , you moved as senior adviser to South Asia's&#13;
Technical Department.&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: I don't even rem e mb er that because that was part of m y departure.&#13;
I wasn't coming in to work. I wasn't doing anything.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Did you work on governance?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: No. I gave it a half-hearted stab. But I remember that a former&#13;
colleagu e who h a d b ee n mad e an adviser called m e up when this was announced ,&#13;
saying, "Welcome to AA , Advisers Anonymous. " As you know, to move f rom a&#13;
real job to an adviser job was th e ultimat e ins u lt.&#13;
&#13;
ZE NNI: Okay. Moving on to the World Bank pres ide nts you served under,&#13;
what is your assessment of the va rious presid e nts under whose leade rship y ou&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
served during your tenure at the Bank? And these would be McNamara, [Alden&#13;
W.] Clausen, Conable, and [Lewis T.] Preston .&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Well, of course, the World Bank party game is to complain about&#13;
the president. So when McNamara was there, we complained bitterly. He was a&#13;
control freak. He managed everything himself. We said, " Boy, we need a&#13;
breath of fresh air in here." The minute he left and Clausen came in, every body&#13;
was missing the good old days under McNamara. We had, as the conventional&#13;
wisdom goes, three relatively weak presidents: Clausen, Conable, and Preston.&#13;
They didn't make much of an impact. They all did those dumb reorganizations&#13;
which did not bring any glory on any of them, even though they may think it did.&#13;
And they let the Bank run itself for the most part, a thing that the Bank happens&#13;
to be very good at doing. So the Bank was fine, and everybody growls now&#13;
about ineffective presidents, but at the time they were gods. The president of&#13;
the World Bank to the staff of the World Bank is king. I think it's partl y the&#13;
internationalism of the institution, that people who come from hierarchical&#13;
structures have great respect for the person at the top. You I i ved in awe of that&#13;
guy even if you didn't respect or like him or you thought he was weak.&#13;
I didn't have much of an opinion of those presidents. I traveled in India with&#13;
Clausen on what I think was his only visit to India, and I found him just a real&#13;
nice guy and that was all. And I'm sure I would have found, had I spent time,&#13;
which I didn't, with either Barber Conable or Lew Preston , I would have found&#13;
them real nice guys.&#13;
&#13;
For all of that era, in effect, Ernie Stern was acting president of the World Bank .&#13;
There were a few very powerful guys who kept the Bank running , like Ernie and&#13;
Moeen Qureshi. Since I happened to like both Ernie and Moeen, I was per fe ctly&#13;
happy. I'm happy to say that I missed the next two presidents , both[James D.]&#13;
Wolfensohn and [Paul D.] Wolfowitz . I mean, we had one strong president,&#13;
three weak, and then at least one strong one.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Wolfensohn?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes. But Wolfensohn just destroyed the Bank that I knew. He&#13;
may have made it better, but it's a different Bank now, and I'm glad I was not&#13;
here to watch the carnage. So I don't think strong is so good either.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Well, in your opinion, what should be the criteria for selecting a good&#13;
World Bank president in terms of both personal and professional leadership&#13;
attributes?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: That's m y point, that y ou can't win , but certainly a balance is&#13;
needed between personal and professional attributes. The person should know a&#13;
lot about development or about international economic issues , which&#13;
Wolfensohn did. So that's important. He should, above all, be se cu re enough to .&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                     37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
listen to others. That's a crucial personality trait, to hear and to listen and to be&#13;
able to take criticism and to respect the phenomenal wealth of wisdom that&#13;
exists in the World Bank and not denigrate it and not ignore it, but to listen to it,&#13;
and to have the sense and the security to listen to it. The president should not&#13;
be an egomaniac, if possible, but how does he get to this kind of job if he's not&#13;
an egomaniac?&#13;
&#13;
So, personality issues are probably more important, but then somebody is going&#13;
to say he's too controlling and somebody is going to say he's too weak. Take&#13;
the last two presidents. I don't know either of them at all, and I'm speaking&#13;
mainly second-hand. One was driven largely by insecurity and one may be&#13;
driven by excessive security, and, as a result, neither one is a good listener. I&#13;
think listening to the staff is the most important thing, and listening to contrary&#13;
opinions is the most important thing any manager, right up to the top, could do.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay. Turning now to reflections. As you look back on your tenure,&#13;
as far as you can recall, where has the Bank been inost successful and where has&#13;
it been least successful in adjusting itself to a changing world?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: I 'm not sure I have followed closely enough to be able to answer&#13;
that. The Bank has become much less central, much less relevant to the&#13;
international deve I opmen t process. Private financing is now huge and trumps&#13;
the Bank's loans. The big borrowers, the lndias, Brazils, Chinas and Indonesias&#13;
of the world, don't need the Bank at all in the same way. They can do it in other&#13;
ways; the shoe is on the other foot. I guess the Bank has done a reasonable job&#13;
of accepting its changed role and its diminished, in the tradition a l sense , role .&#13;
They haven't any choice. I mean, they have just had to face reality. The y 've&#13;
certainly done a good job in promoting the social sectors. I think they're doing&#13;
a good job in acknowledging again that infrastructure matters. I've known it all&#13;
along, but they had to go through a period of not knowing it. Now they seem to&#13;
be coming back to that eternal wisdom. The y 're still too institutionally&#13;
egomaniacal. They still think that they have to be part of the solution to eve ry&#13;
single problem. They have never been any good at eliminating initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Selectivity?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes. And I see no evidence that the y' re any good at it no w . I&#13;
think they are carrying the war on corruption too far. But on the whole, it is&#13;
still an admirable institution that has an important role to play. Somebod y once&#13;
said about the government of India, in th e old days , if the y pass a law and f ind&#13;
out that the law doesn't work the way it was intended to, they pass another law&#13;
to fix what was wrong with the first law and then the y pass a third law to fix&#13;
what do esn't work. What they should do, of co urs e, is d ism an ti e the first I aw.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It's like the U.S. Income Tax Code. It just gets more and more and more a nd&#13;
more and more complicated. They should start over and write it in one page.&#13;
The World Bank should in some sense start over and pretend like it was&#13;
established yesterday; have a virtual Bretton Woods and figure out what's&#13;
needed. But they can't do that because they've got so much baggage in terms of&#13;
staff and history and egos all over the place that they can't rethink themselves.&#13;
And they've done a pretty good job of moving this barnacle-encrusted super&#13;
tanker to keep up with changing times. It would be better if they would remake&#13;
themselves as a fast little speed boat , but I don't think that's in the cards.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Looking back, what have you learned from your experience at the&#13;
Bank, and what has it meant to you personally serving as unique an institu t ion&#13;
as the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: When I left the World Bank, I didn't know what to do with&#13;
myself because I didn't leave happily or voluntarily . So I went to law school,&#13;
where I had a terrific time, and I began thinking to myself, "By golly, I should&#13;
have done this 35 years ago instead of going to the World Bank. I would have&#13;
been a terrific lawyer and I would have had a lot of fun prac t icing law, and I&#13;
chose the wrong career path." But the more I tried on that attitude, the more I&#13;
thought, "No, I would not have given up by World Bank experience for any thin g&#13;
in the world." It is the most fun, elite , and interesting group of people in any&#13;
workplace in the world. The average is higher. The number of friends you can&#13;
make or people that you want to keep up with or people that it's interesting to be&#13;
with is unbeatable. The world travel is certainly a plus; being able to visit all&#13;
kinds of countries and not just as an ordinary human bein g, but parachuting in&#13;
as a demigod of some sort and being treated royally by the government and the&#13;
resident mission is all very heady stuff. And , imagine, you get to do all that&#13;
while convincing yourself that you're doing good for the world .&#13;
&#13;
After leaving, I've questioned more and more how much good I actually did for&#13;
the world, since the world does not seem to have changed ve ry much in spite of&#13;
all my efforts. In many, many ways it has gotten worse. But certainly, at least&#13;
while you're doing it, while you're enjoying all the perks of World Bank-hood,&#13;
you're feeling very righteous and very generous-spirited and very socially-&#13;
minded. And, in fact, you are all those things. What a wonderful co.mbina t ion&#13;
of being able to do well while doing good, or do good while doin g well. It's&#13;
unbeatable and will remain unbeatable, and that's exactly why it will never&#13;
change because everybody likes being here.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Of your many contributions to the Bank's mission , what do you&#13;
consider to be the most important?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: It would be a tie between whatever contribution I made as&#13;
director of PHR and whatever contribution I made in the India Division. I think&#13;
                                 Ann 0. Hamilton&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
we made a difference in getting the social sectors to become more important on&#13;
the map and on the agenda. I think there has been a crucial and critical sea&#13;
change that has taken place. So, on the one hand, it was maybe the five years of&#13;
pushing sectors that were really important and that really did catch on. On the&#13;
other, it may have been way back at the beginning. I think those infrastructure&#13;
projects really did make a difference in a country as big and as important as&#13;
India. And it might have been the Arun Hydroelectric Project, but alas, we&#13;
never had a chance to find that out.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Is there anything you still wish to talk about that I might have perhaps&#13;
overlooked?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: No . I was thinking as I was talking that in my early days the&#13;
World Bank depended a lot on mentoring, protectors, friends, connections, and&#13;
people. And each person had his or her own network, people that they turned to&#13;
in crisis . That was one of the things that resonated with me on the Appeals&#13;
Committee and one of the things that always resonated with me in general. I&#13;
always felt like I was some kind of Earth Mother. I mean, people came to me&#13;
all the time with questions and problems and seeking advice. That s ystem, of&#13;
course, was bad in that it involved a lot of cronyism, and people who had&#13;
powerful friend s did better than people who didn't have powerful friends. And&#13;
so there's a good side and a bad side to it. But of late it seems to me to have&#13;
been largely lost because everybody is so scared and protecting themselves so&#13;
thoroughly that they don't have the energy or the time or the inclination to adopt&#13;
a new staff member and serve as a mentor to him or her.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: There's a survival culture?&#13;
&#13;
HAMILTON: Yes, exactly, precisely. And it's not generous-spirited anymore&#13;
and it's not a bout mentors and it's not about becoming a dvisers and leaders so&#13;
that new people come in and have an adviser and a mentor. It's about every man&#13;
for himself, and that's a shame . I mean, you will notice in the course of thi s&#13;
interview how many individuals I've mentioned, because that's the way it&#13;
worked and that's how you did well and that's how you did badly. If you went&#13;
to work for somebody who didn't like you , you were n't treated nicel y . But if&#13;
you had friends in high places, you could get things done. And so both the good&#13;
aspects a nd the bad aspects of th a t, I think, a re being increasingly lost.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Is there a nything else you'd like to add ?&#13;
&#13;
HAMIL TON: I can't think of a thing.&#13;
&#13;
ZENNI: Okay. Well, thank you so very much for a wonderful contribution to&#13;
the Bank's Oral History Progr a m.&#13;
