&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Scarce and unevenly distributed water resources have made water a key economic&#13;
and social development issue in the Middle East and North Africa region. More than&#13;
three quarters of the population of World Bank client countries in MENA have access&#13;
to clean water and improved sanitation, but service is often not continuous, and&#13;
access to water in rural areas often lags behind, as do access to sanitation and&#13;
wastewater treatment.&#13;
&#13;
Balancing cost-recovery and affordability concerns are recurrent priorities for&#13;
service providers and policy-makers in MENA World Bank client countries, as well as&#13;
improving environmental sustainability and water resources management, given the&#13;
scarcity of water resources in the MENA region.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank and the Center for Mediterranean Integration (CMI) in partnership&#13;
with GIZ and the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), organized&#13;
the first regional workshop on Regulating Water Services Provision in MENA in&#13;
Marseille, France, on July 28-30th, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
The workshop brought together water and sanitation service providers, regulatory&#13;
authorities and policy-makers from several countries of the MENA region (Egypt,&#13;
Morocco, Palestine and Tunisia) as well as Albania, Australia, France, the Netherlands&#13;
and the US. Development partners and civil society representatives also participated&#13;
in the workshop, with the objective of discussing the potential for regulation of water&#13;
services as an instrument to reach sustainable water and sanitation services for all in&#13;
the region.&#13;
&#13;
This workshop looked at the potential of regulation for improving these aspects of&#13;
water and sanitation services provision, by considering the experience of developing&#13;
and developed countries alike. As well as this summary report on the proceedings of&#13;
the workshop, this event has sparked interest in the creation a formal or informal&#13;
Community of Practice on the topic of the regulation of water and sanitation services&#13;
in the MENA region.&#13;

Opening&#13;
&#13;
The session began with participants describing their objectives and expected&#13;
outcomes from the workshop. The Palestinian delegation described their current&#13;
situation working on regulatory and institutional reform of the water sector and&#13;
developing an independent regulatory council. Tunisia and Egypt were particularly&#13;
interested in comparing their experience with that of other Mediterranean countries&#13;
working in similar conditions; Tunisia was particularly interested in strategic&#13;
planning for Water Supply and Sanitation. Finally, Morocco was interested in the&#13;
potential application of a regulatory framework as part of an ongoing national water&#13;
sector reform.&#13;
The organizers thanked the participants and encouraged them to think about staying&#13;
in touch with each other and keeping abreast of future developments in the water&#13;
sector in the region via a formal or informal Community of Practice, which could be&#13;
supported by the World Bank. Dr. Jamison also pointed out to a number of key&#13;
references for further reading.1&#13;

&amp;#12;1. Regulation of Water Utilities - A Primer - Mark Jamison&#13;
&#13;
The session began with participants prioritizing their regulatory objectives in the&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation sector. Balancing cost-recovery and affordability&#13;
concerns were recurrent priorities, as well as improving environmental&#13;
sustainability and water resources management, given the scarcity of water&#13;
resources in the MENA region. Customer satisfaction and the provision of&#13;
equitable services to all was also a priority concern.&#13;
&#13;
Dr Jamison highlighted the importance of not considering regulation in a vacuum: the&#13;
quality of the organizations of the water sector goes a long way in determining the&#13;
quality of the regulation. There are several overarching considerations for regulators&#13;
in the water sector: (i) credibility (ensuring that stakeholders have confidence in the&#13;
regulation of the water sector); (ii) legitimacy (consumers must be convinced that the&#13;
regulatory system will protect them from the exercise of monopoly power, whether&#13;
reflected in high prices, poor service, or both); (iii) transparency (the regulator is held&#13;
accountable by customers, politicians and utilities); and (iv) efficiency. Below are the&#13;
main regulatory functions in the water sector; note that these may be (and often are)&#13;
split between different institutions or regulatory authorities, and may be informal&#13;
(e.g. decision-making processes) or formal (laws, decrees):&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Issuing licenses,&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Setting performance standards,&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Monitoring performance standards,&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Establishing price levels and rate structure,&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Establishing a uniform system of accounts,&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Arbitrating stakeholder disputes,&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Performing management audits (and evaluating business plans),&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Developing human resources,&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Coordinating activities with other agencies, and&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Reporting sector performance and commission activities to appropriate&#13;
       government authorities.&#13;
&#13;
During the Q&amp;A, Morocco explained that it was in the process of regionalizing water&#13;
supply and sanitation and wondered whether it would be better to establish regional&#13;
water regulators. Responses from various regulatory experts included that a national&#13;
or a regional regulator would both be possible; but a national regulator may present&#13;
additional benefits, in terms of capacity/ human resources as well as benchmarking.&#13;
Participants also wondered how regulators were established and selected. It was&#13;
discussed that the advantage of a commission or a panel of regulators is that it&#13;
decreases the risks of the regulator becoming corrupt. It also allows for a range of&#13;
skills and expertise, as regulators often need to have legal, technical and&#13;
economic/financial skills as well as political awareness. Some independent regulators&#13;
have a corporate structure, with a board of directors who hires a CEO to do day-to-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         5&#13;
&amp;#12;day operations. Regulators that are elected tend to focus more on 'populist' issues&#13;
and are less independent.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
2. Institutional Arrangements and the Political Economy of Regulation&#13;
&#13;
The regulator's role is to safeguard the public interest, by ensuring the sustainability&#13;
of the resource, ensuring accountability for consumers who are not on the system and&#13;
future consumers, as well as mediate between customers, service providers and the&#13;
government. However, vested interests can destroy the value of regulation: for&#13;
instance, favored consumers like prices that are too low, but powerful labor groups&#13;
and input suppliers benefit from inflated prices. It is particularly important, when&#13;
establishing a regulatory authority, to clarify each sector institution's role and&#13;
avoiding overlaps, as well as define the key principles of regulation:&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Defining the scope of regulation&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Ensuring stakeholder participation, transparency and accountability&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Defining and prioritizing public service obligations&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Designing and implementing of performance incentives for service providers,&#13;
       based on benchmarking studies&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Developing regulatory agency leadership and professional support staff.&#13;
&#13;
The regulator may be led to deal with conflicts between stakeholders, which may&#13;
stem from (i) a lack of clarity on roles ("authority conflicts"), (ii) disagreements over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       6&#13;
&amp;#12;current/ historical facts and causal linkages ("cognitive conflicts"), (iii) conflicting&#13;
priorities and different weights on outcomes ("value conflicts") and/or (iv) the fact&#13;
that stakeholders benefit differently ("interest conflicts").&#13;
&#13;
Several case studies highlighted the various issues tied to the political economy of&#13;
water which a regulator could run into, and the way countries around the world have&#13;
dealt with them. Uganda's regulator has experimented with a performance indicator&#13;
with weighted priorities (e.g. access, efficiency, Non-Revenue Water, etc) in order to&#13;
help operators focus on investing in priority areas. The case of Rio de Janeiro, which&#13;
filed a lawsuit and negotiated an agreement with Sao Paulo over the allocation of&#13;
water resources in the country, highlighted the adaptive capacity of the sector in&#13;
dealing with pressures on water resources. Finally, in response to concerns over how&#13;
to ensure the consumers do pay their water bills, Albania shared its model contract&#13;
between service provider and consumers, which is available on its website.&#13;

3. Keynote Speech by Minister of Water, Palestine and Head of&#13;
Palestinian Water Authority - Honorable Minister Mazen Ghunaim&#13;
&#13;
Water in Palestine is subject to resources constraints and political and human&#13;
pressures, as well as service provision constraints due to the weak state of the&#13;
infrastructure, which impedes economic and human development. The Minister&#13;
highlighted that most of the catchment area in Gaza cannot be used due to salinization&#13;
and sewage contamination. The Palestinian government is trying to find solutions to&#13;
this problem, including desalination; its focus is on trying to build strong, transparent&#13;
institutions to manage the sector.&#13;
&#13;
Since 2009, it has been implementing a plan for the reform of the water sector, which&#13;
prioritizes cost recovery, strategic planning and awareness raising efforts. The&#13;
planned water sector reform would entail (i) a new law on water to determine&#13;
regulation, policy, the sustainable use of water resources and water allocation issues;&#13;
(ii) a new national water company to supply water to the 3 main operators and&#13;
provide technical support to the 226 small water services providers current&#13;
operating in Palestine, which under the reform process will be reduced to few number&#13;
of regional water and sanitation utilities, as well as (iii) a new regulatory authority to&#13;
provide permits, regulate tariffs, and deliver licenses to water operators.&#13;
&#13;
Palestine is keen to understand the experience of other countries, including those that&#13;
are leading a water sector reform plan. In particular, there is a need to learn more&#13;
from other countries on how consumers can be encouraged to pay their water bills,&#13;
when there has been a culture of avoiding payment (which contributes to low cost&#13;
recovery for operators).&#13;
&#13;
Minister of Water, Palestine, Mr. Mazen Ghunaim, was born in Amman, Jordan in&#13;
1966. He graduated from Paris University XI in 1993. He is specialized in electrical&#13;
and industrial engineering. His work experience began as industrial engineer in&#13;
Jordan, and in energy generation in Tunisia. In 1997, he was nominated as a deputy&#13;
to the Director General of the Palestinian Energy Authority until 2003. In 2003 he&#13;
became the Director General of the Ministry of Energy and Nature Resources for two&#13;
years and Director General of Nature resources Sector for another two years. In 2008,&#13;
he was nominated as a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Local Government, in charge&#13;
of the development of the Palestinian local governmental sector. The Ministry under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        8&#13;
&amp;#12;his leadership is developing strategic plans, infrastructure and capacity building&#13;
development projects for all Palestinian LGUs. Currently, Mazen Ghunaim is the Head&#13;
of Palestinian Water Authority, and Head of the committee on negotiation of the&#13;
permanent status of the water with Israel and also a member of the Arab Council of&#13;
water ministers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Case Study: Albania: Establishing a Water Regulatory Authority - Avni&#13;
Dervishi&#13;
&#13;
After briefly introducing the audience to the water resources and water sector in&#13;
Albania, Mr. Dervishi outlined the reasons for establishing an independent regulator&#13;
in Albania. These included (i) the protection of consumer interests; (ii) ensuring the&#13;
financial sustainability of the utilities; (iii) encouraging competition within the sector;&#13;
and, (iv) protecting water resources and the environment. There were political and&#13;
logistical challenges associated with the transfer of regulatory competencies in the&#13;
first year, and the need for government support (particularly budgetary) in the first&#13;
year of establishment.&#13;
&#13;
The National Regulatory Commission (composed of 5 members) regulate the water&#13;
sector, through the following instruments:&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Licensing of utilities: at the moment, there is only one license, but there are&#13;
       discussions for separating bulk and retail water utilities licensing;&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Tariff regulation, including tariff approval: this competency was initially&#13;
       disputed by local governments. This has now been clarified: utilities submit a&#13;
       plan to local governments for approval, and final approval rests with the&#13;
       regulator. There are tariff for 3 categories of consumers for water, as well as&#13;
       bulk water tariff, which now covers 113% of O&amp;M costs and 80% of total costs&#13;
       on average. Some utilities cover all their costs from their own revenue.&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Performance monitoring: The regulator has established performance&#13;
       contracts with the municipality, and with the regulator. Tariffs and&#13;
       performance are reviewed yearly, and the regulator has defined 10 KPIs.&#13;
       Utilities are grouped based on the number of water connections and ranked&#13;
       every year. The National Commission assigns a weighing to each KPI every&#13;
       year. Next year, they plan on adding more KPIs (16). In particular, one of the&#13;
       KPIs is 'regulator perception', which measures the compliance of utilities with&#13;
       the regulator in terms of licensing, responsiveness, participation with training,&#13;
       etc.&#13;
   ï&#130;§   The regulator also carries out studies on customer satisfaction, which have&#13;
       shown that there is a willingness to pay more for better services, and a need&#13;
       to improve water quality as 80% of consumers buy bottled water for drinking.&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Transparency and customer protection: the regulator has put in place&#13;
       mandatory service contract, setting the rights and obligations of both parties&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         9&#13;
&amp;#12;       as well as complaint resolution mechanisms; it has also instituted public&#13;
       hearings as part of the tariff-setting process.&#13;
&#13;
The National Regulatory Commission also measures its efficiency, and has calculated&#13;
that their services 'cost' 52 cents per customer. The budget for the Commission comes&#13;
from regulatory fees, which are collected from the utilities. The main budget items for&#13;
the Commission have to be approved by the government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Avni Dervishi is the Chairman of the National Regulatory Commission of the&#13;
Water Regulatory Authority in Albania since May 2008. As a Civil Engineer, he has&#13;
over 30 years of experience in research, design, supervision, management of water&#13;
supply and sewerage systems and water regulatory sector. He has been a leader of&#13;
sector reform in Albania, such as his participation in the development and&#13;
implementation of the water sector strategies, especially, in regulatory terms. He has&#13;
participated in many national and international Conferences representing the Water&#13;
Regulatory Authority and its current achievements and challenges. Under Mr.&#13;
Dervishiâ&#128;&#153;s direction, the WRA has made significant steps forward by expanding and&#13;
strengthening the role of regulation in the water sector.&#13;

5. Benchmarking Water Utilities - Bill Kingdom&#13;
Performance improvements can derive from management initiatives within the&#13;
operator (internally motivated) as well as from incentives developed by oversight&#13;
agencies (externally motivated. In both instances, the purpose of benchmarking is to&#13;
develop an understanding of relative performance and possible ways for meeting&#13;
improved performance targets. Mainly two types of benchmarking methodologies are&#13;
used by service providers and sector regulators:&#13;
   ï&#130;§ Metric benchmarking, which is when service providers are ideally grouped&#13;
       into business units that face similar operating conditions, and the use of input&#13;
       resources to deliver outputs are compared. There are four most commonly&#13;
       used methods for data analysis in order to assess relative performance:&#13;
       regression analysis; average input/output ratios; sophisticated ratios (based&#13;
       on more stratified samples); and data envelopment analysis.&#13;
   ï&#130;§ Process benchmarking, which aims to provide a means of achieving best&#13;
       possible performance based on the detailed analysis of operating systems.&#13;
       Regulator may take a role in identifying best practices and sharing them.&#13;
&#13;
A set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used by many regulatory authorities&#13;
to identify trends, evaluate performance, and establish targets. It may be difficult to&#13;
get a 'like per like' comparison, so the evolution of KPIs per se and comparisons&#13;
between utilities and between countries may not tell the full story. Sometimes these&#13;
core indicators are given specific weights and aggregated into an aggregated&#13;
Performance Indicator (as is the case in Uganda). The assessment of relative&#13;
performance is a mix of art and science and practitioners should make their&#13;
assessments using multiple tools, and be cognizant of factors that are outside the&#13;
control of management but impact on use of resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    11&#13;
&amp;#12;No matter what methodology is used, a solid data collection and analysis system, and&#13;
quality data is necessary for benchmarking. Improved data quality can be achieved&#13;
by using data verifiers (e.g. consulting engineers, independent from engineering&#13;
activities); error bars can also be assigned to each data point. A quick benchmarking&#13;
exercise demonstrated that uncertainties in data points can have a wide variation in&#13;
the final performance ratios. A good resource for benchmarking at the regional or&#13;
international level is IBNET.&#13;
&#13;
Benchmarking can be a powerful tool to influence utility management, but there are&#13;
different ways to apply it. Some regulators apply peer pressure through so-called&#13;
"sunshine regulation", in which the regulator sheds some light on the performance of&#13;
the sector. The model of writing an annual 'State of the Water Sector' report is a good&#13;
way to start demonstrating what the regulator is trying to achieve, which can then&#13;
help civil society pick up on the performance of services. Some regulators also apply&#13;
incentives and penalties to low-performing utilities; but in this case, enforceability is&#13;
key.&#13;

Mr. Bill Kingdom is the Global Lead for Water Supply and Sanitation in the World&#13;
Bank. During his career in the water sector he has worked extensively in the UK, USA,&#13;
Canada, South Asia and East Asia. Bill has led many urban and rural water supply&#13;
investment projects, supported regulators, provided policy advice and implemented&#13;
a number of innovative PPP projects including small town design build lease&#13;
contracts in Vietnam, wastewater operations contracts in Canada, city-wide&#13;
concession contract in Romania and performance based leakage contract in&#13;
HoChiMinh City. He is currently leading a project in India to deliver 24/7 water&#13;
supplies in three cities in Karnataka. Bill has undertaken, and provided advice to,&#13;
benchmarking studies in many countries including UK, USA, Canada, Vietnam,&#13;
Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, India and Bangladesh. He set up the IBNET system in the&#13;
World Bank which is now the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest database of water utilities.&#13;

6. Case study: Regulation and Benchmarking in the Netherlands with&#13;
Public Sector Providers - Ben de Ru&#13;
&#13;
Ben briefly introduced the audience to the water sector in the Netherlands, which is&#13;
composed of 26 water boards (a board is elected every 4 years, which sets the&#13;
guidelines for the next 5 years, as well as the budget and the tariffs on wastewater&#13;
treatment and flood protection) as well as 10 (public) drinking water companies.&#13;
&#13;
Waternet promotes and implements a voluntary "sunshine" benchmarking system, in&#13;
order to learn and improve overall efficiency. All water boards and water companies&#13;
have joined this benchmarking exercise, even though it is not mandatory. The fact&#13;
that Waternet promotes voluntary comparisons between utilities/ water boards&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      12&#13;
&amp;#12;ensures that the quality of the data is quite high; it is available through open data on&#13;
their website. Waternet operates several types of benchmarks, including a national&#13;
benchmark for wastewater treatment every 3 years, which assesses over 75 KPIs&#13;
related to wastewater treatment, financial sustainability, environmental&#13;
sustainability, energy consumption and innovation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Ben de Ru has been working with Waternet in Amsterdam since 2009 as Team&#13;
leader Program Management within the Waste Water department. Waternet is&#13;
responsible for drinking water, wastewater and surface water (flood control) in the&#13;
Amsterdam area. As team leader and program manager, Ben is responsible for the&#13;
wastewater treatment investment program, which contains multiple wastewater&#13;
projects such as new wastewater treatment facilities and the optimization of the&#13;
wastewater treatment facility. Since 2012, Ben has been working part-time with&#13;
World Waternet as a Program manager for the Sanitation Program in the province of&#13;
Banten Indonesia. World Waternet is part Waternet and a non-profit organisation&#13;
that supports developing countries in their efforts to improve Sanitation, Drinking&#13;
water supply and Water management. World Waternet is active in amongst others&#13;
Africa, Suriname and Indonesia.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Opening&#13;
The participants reflected on the purpose of regulation, which is one of the many tools&#13;
available to improve the performance of the sector. It is important to bear in mind&#13;
that the expected outcome is to reach sustainable, equitable and affordable access to&#13;
WSS for all, and that regulation is not an end in itself. A formal regulator is not always&#13;
necessary (e.g. in the Netherlands, there is no regulator, as there is adequate human&#13;
and technical capacity), but it can help strengthen the sector, provided other aspects&#13;
are working too (e.g. systems for mediation and arbitration).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7. Approaches to rate-setting, cost, incentives and prices - Mark Jamison&#13;
&#13;
The water sector is known for having prices that do not cover the costs of the service.&#13;
Typically, if prices do not cover the costs of providing the service, someone else has&#13;
to pay for the shortfall; it could be the users, the people in the service area, or the&#13;
government, which is ultimately the citizens. In order for services to be technically&#13;
and commercially viable, regulators must first estimate the cost of the service&#13;
provided by the utilities. It is important to understand that prices need to cover the&#13;
costs of investment, not just the costs of O&amp;M; otherwise this will discourage future&#13;
investment. The basic formula to calculate the Cost of Service (i.e. revenue required&#13;
by the service provider) was discussed.&#13;
Another form of calculating allowable cost recovery or revenue which regulators use&#13;
is Price Cap Regulation, which allows for regular change in prices based on the rate&#13;
of inflation, minus an expected productivity factor (other adjustments can be taken&#13;
into account too). Price cap regulation generally provides greater incentive to be&#13;
efficient and reduce cost, but is not as widely used in systems which require heavy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          14&#13;
&amp;#12;investment and where the emphasis is on greater investment and increasing tariffs.&#13;
There are also Hybrid Schemes, where operator and customers share efficiency&#13;
gains and which provides additional incentives for efficiency.&#13;
Since data may be imperfect or change over time, the regulator will need to re-&#13;
evaluate the estimated revenue required by the utility regularly. The frequency of the&#13;
revisions will depend on the degree of confidence of the price calculations â&#128;&#147; and is&#13;
often seen as one of the differences between cost of service and price cap regulation.&#13;
A good accounting system that is the same over time and across operators is&#13;
necessary so that the regulator can compare unit costs across service providers and&#13;
be more efficient. The regulator also needs to put in place methods for reporting key&#13;
information, and procedures for audits on key information. Cross-checking different&#13;
sources of information may also help, as operators may report accounting costs for&#13;
different government authorities, which can help the regulator gain a better&#13;
understanding of the financial health of the utility.&#13;
Tariff categories (e.g. social tariffs) and rate structures (e.g. increasing/ decreasing&#13;
block, flat fee, connection fee, seasonal fee, wastewater pricing) can be designed in&#13;
order to maximize cost-recovery as well as ensure affordability of services. Improving&#13;
technical and commercial efficiency can improve cost recovery independently of tariff&#13;
levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8. MENA experience with cost recovery and financial sustainability&#13;
&#13;
The participants shared their current and planned sector performance with regards&#13;
to cost recovery and financial sustainability.&#13;
Egypt explained that tariff reform for water is current underway, with a resolution&#13;
adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 2015. By 2020, O&amp;M, rehabilitation as well&#13;
as depreciation will be fully covered by utilities, with the state providing subsidies to&#13;
recover costs in the meantime.&#13;
Palestine outlined its vision for cost recovery of the sector, which is based on the&#13;
following pillars:&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Proper management of fixed assets&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Implementation of accrual accounting&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Proper financial treatment of grant fund&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Effective regulation&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Utilize economies of scale&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Efficiency of O&amp;M&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Socio-Economic Factors&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Staff optimization and HR development&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Proper costing and tariff setting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      15&#13;
&amp;#12;Palestine's 2014 Water Law 2014 stipulates that tariffs must guarantee cost recovery&#13;
for service providers (costs include O&amp;M, asset depreciation on real costs, loans and&#13;
interest and development investments). The next steps for Palestine lies in designing&#13;
an incentive program to help municipalities to join the reform process, as well as&#13;
strengthening the sanitation network and dealing with the culture of non-payment&#13;
for water and sanitation services.&#13;
Morocco has a complex set of institutional checks and balances for tariff setting,&#13;
which involves the Ministry for Energy, Mines, Water and Environment, the Ministry&#13;
of Finance, the Ministry of General Affairs which has set up an interministerial council&#13;
for tariff approval, as well as the Ministry of the Interior which looks after tariffs at&#13;
the 'commune' level. There are public and private operators involved in Morocco,&#13;
with ONEE managing both bulk production and most of the water distribution, as well&#13;
as a number of private operators (essentially in cities) and multi-sector service&#13;
providers. A performance contract has been established between ONEE and the&#13;
Moroccan government, which includes planned tariff reform. Cross-subsidies from&#13;
energy to water and related to bulk water services were described.&#13;
Tunisia gave a snapshot of the sector, including its water resources constraints.&#13;
SONEDE provides water 24/7 in densely populated areas and currently has a&#13;
coverage rate of 83%. The tariff system is complex, with 7 categories of consumers&#13;
with an 8-fold increase in tariffs between the first and the last category. There are&#13;
cross-subsidies between categories of consumers, and between service areas. As&#13;
there is no mechanism in place for reviewing tariffs, cost-recovery for SONEDE has&#13;
been steadily declining due to inflation and other incidences on the costs of labor,&#13;
electricity, etc. ONAS (Sanitation) only recovers 63% of their costs and benefits from&#13;
an annual government subsidy. Finally, cost recovery (when measured as a&#13;
percentage of opex and depreciation) for drinking water supply in rural areas is low&#13;
at 67%; the government again provides a subsidy as tariffs are capped at 1 dinar per&#13;
cubic meter. Tunisia is engaging a discussion on potential reform for the 2016-2020&#13;
development plan.&#13;

&amp;#12;       Case Study on Water Regulation in Australia: Sydney Water&#13;

9. Key Messages: Regulation in the Water Sector (Case Study: Australia)&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;§    Regulation is an economic and political process&#13;
   ï&#130;§    Better regulation can contribute to better outcomes, if accompanied by&#13;
        sector and governance reform&#13;
   ï&#130;§    Regulation evolves - you don't have to solve every problem at once.&#13;
   ï&#130;§    The regulator has to have its own business plan with its own objectives and&#13;
        priorities&#13;
   ï&#130;§    There are a lot of challenges in building up institutional capacity; capacity-&#13;
        building needs to go not just to the regulator, but also the utility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IPART was established in 1992 as an independent transparent regulator of Sydney&#13;
Water, a Government-owned corporatized water utility, in order to deal with issues&#13;
linked to the pricing of water: cost recovery (low profits), inefficient delivery and&#13;
pricing of services, and cross-subsidies. The entrenched cross-subsidies reflected the&#13;
politicization of pricing with impacts on consumers and the environment, political&#13;
control, as well as the lack of efficiency and prices benefiting those with political&#13;
power. IPART's approach evolved over time. It initially focused on removal of cross-&#13;
subsidies. It set tough efficiency targets and used this to unwind the cross-subsidies&#13;
while avoiding large increases in prices for some customers. After 2000 it focused on&#13;
commercial returns and investment incentives as the cross-subsidies had been&#13;
largely eliminated. .&#13;
IPART has used weighted average price caps in regulating electricity but in water it&#13;
has set specific individual prices.This is because Sydney Water wanted the regulator&#13;
to take responsibility for changes in price structure. However this system may be&#13;
inefficient and some consider it heavy-handed, so a move to a Weighted Average Price&#13;
Cap is overdue.&#13;
What has been achieved after 20 years of regulation? There are no longer any cross&#13;
subsidies: tariffs reflect the costs of service. Efficiency has increased, and the&#13;
profitability of Sydney Water has also improved. Residential bills have remained&#13;
constant or decreased in real terms for most of the period, but when costs rose due&#13;
to a new desalination plant to increase reliability, IPART achieved a 40% real increase&#13;
in prices in 4 years. Investment in desalination was linked to water security issues&#13;
during a long-term drought in the 2000's; in 2011, the Government decided to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     17&#13;
&amp;#12;privatize its desalination plant. IPART established a price path that underpinned the&#13;
privatization. The prices reflect the efficient costs of the plant and allow for recovery&#13;
of shutdown costs and fixed costs when the plant is shutdown.&#13;
The regulator had to ensure that the removal of cross-subsidies between different&#13;
categories of consumers did not affect affordability. IPART collected a lot of data on&#13;
the effects of change in tariff structures on households, and put that information in&#13;
the public domain. The Australian State Government provides a rebate for pensioners&#13;
and people on social benefits. During the major initial major price reforms Sydney&#13;
Water also set aside some funds to cope with households who find it difficult to deal&#13;
with increase in charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Eric Groom has been a significant contributor to the development of regulation&#13;
in Australia since 1992 when he joined the Independent Pricing and Regulatory&#13;
Tribunal of NSW on its establishment. IPART was the first independent multi-sector&#13;
utility regulator established in Australia and has had responsibility for the regulation&#13;
of energy, water, public transport and, more recently, local government in NSW. Eric&#13;
worked with IPART as Chief Economist and then Principal Adviser for 1992-2004 and&#13;
then 2007-2014. During this period he was also an advisor to the South Australian&#13;
Government, the Tasmanian, ACT and Northern Territory regulators, and, most&#13;
recently, the Australian Energy Regulator on the development of regulatory&#13;
frameworks. In 2015 he was awarded the Australian Public Service Medal for his&#13;
outstanding contribution to the development of regulation in Australia and, through&#13;
the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme and Energy Savings Schemes, the reduction&#13;
in greenhouse gas emissions. From 2004-2007 Eric was a Senior Regulatory&#13;
Specialist with World Bank. During this period he led a program of research on the&#13;
regulation of the water sector and contributed to the review and development of&#13;
energy regulation and energy efficiency frameworks in a number of countries in East&#13;
Asia and the Pacific, Middle East and North Africa, and Eastern Europe. Before joining&#13;
IPART Eric worked with the NSW and New Zealand Treasuries, primarily on the&#13;
governance of government-owned businesses tax policy and social impact modelling.&#13;
Since 2014 Eric has been an independent advisor on regulation and sector reforms.&#13;
His clients have included the energy regulators of the Philippines and Vietnam, the&#13;
Australian Energy Market Commission, Sydney Water, the Department of Premier&#13;
and Cabinet, and the NSW Department of Industry. In 2015 he was appointed to an&#13;
expert panel on regulation for PPIAF/World Bank.&#13;

10. Pro-poor regulation - Roland Werchota and Mark Jamison&#13;
&#13;
Including the poor in the regulation of WSS services is the only way to ensure&#13;
universal service provision. But how to we (i) identify (ii) reach sustainably and (iii)&#13;
monitor the provision of services to the poor? There are several ways to identify the&#13;
poor: by location, by asking communities or local governments to identify its poorest&#13;
members themselves, or by using consumption/ standard of living as a proxy. The&#13;
latter is usually less challenging. Tariffs have to recover the costs of water services&#13;
provision - otherwise, the poor will ultimately lose out. There are ways to ensure the&#13;
affordability of tariffs for the poor, by modifying the tariff structure to ensure a&#13;
distribution of the costs of service between consumer categories for instance.&#13;
The challenge lies in the fact that WSS service providers tend to ignore low-income&#13;
areas. If the poor already have access to WSS services, the regulator can collect data&#13;
on the quality of services, and ensure there have appropriate feedback mechanisms&#13;
in place for the utility to engage with them. If they do not have access to WSS services,&#13;
the regulator must ensure that there are participation systems in place so that the&#13;
poor are heard and plans are made for them to be reached with services. There is&#13;
nothing wrong with different service standards (e.g. house connections/ communal&#13;
taps) as long as the minimum service standards (as mandated by national law or&#13;
WHO) are respected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;During the Q&amp;A session, countries shared their experience of juggling the tradeoff&#13;
between affordability and cost-recovery. Tunisia noted that their current tariff&#13;
categories subsidizes people who are better off than the poor, but also that the&#13;
tendency to make the rich pay more can also have negative externalities as they can&#13;
choose to dig their own wells, thereby lowering the revenue of the utility and posing&#13;
additional environmental risks. In Morocco, consumers who use less than 12 cubic&#13;
meters per month get subsidies. The presenters highlighted that it is important to&#13;
engage civil society and the poor in a dialogue with the service provider, rather than&#13;
having illegal connections. It is the regulator' and civil society's job to accompany the&#13;
service provider in this process.&#13;

Mr Roland Werchota is a trained civil engineer (public works) and economist and&#13;
has been working in the water and sanitation sector for the last 25 years. His&#13;
professional work engaged him mainly in Africa and the Middle East where he spend&#13;
over 30 years. He started his carrier in the private construction business with water&#13;
resource management and water and sanitation related infrastructure development.&#13;
Thereafter, he was working for consultants from several countries and GIZ in the&#13;
development cooperation heading programs for restructuring of service providers&#13;
and designing and implementing water sector reform. With his works on reforms he&#13;
concentrated on policy and legal framework development, regulatory frameworks&#13;
and up-scaling of access for water and sanitation through pro-poor financing&#13;
mechanism. He was also engaged in the international and national dialogue on human&#13;
rights to water and sanitation and good governance in the sector. Presently, he is&#13;
senior advisor in Kenya for the technical cooperation GIZ as part of a joint German&#13;
Program with KfW, the German agency for financial cooperation, both in the&#13;
framework of the Kenyan â&#128;&#147; German Bilateral Cooperation.&#13;

11. View from Civil Society - Hachmi Kennou, Institut Mediterraneen de&#13;
l'Eau&#13;
&#13;
Prior to 1992, civil society engagement in the water sector was mostly limited to&#13;
measures to protect consumer rights. Since then, civil society has evolved to include&#13;
organizations concerned with sustainable development as well as the protection of&#13;
consumer rights. In the MENA region, civil society is implicated in the water sector&#13;
through bottom-up approaches (particularly in governance, awareness-raising) and&#13;
top-down approaches (e.g. Mohamed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection).&#13;
There are differences between some organizations, which focus on the&#13;
preoccupations of the North (particularly on water quality and environmental&#13;
sustainability) and the South (focus on sustainable access to WSS services).&#13;
Partnership with civil society could be improved in the water sector, particularly as&#13;
it could help mobilize financial services. Regional approaches to networking in the&#13;
water sector have emerged recently, and include the Euro-Mediterranean&#13;
Partnership, Plan Bleu, FIEA, IME, CMI and others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      20&#13;
&amp;#12;During the Q&amp;A, Morocco explained that they have started to include civil society&#13;
representatives in the water sector, particularly in the river basin agencies. Egypt&#13;
noted that there are around 3000 NGOs in the water sector, with whom they try to&#13;
work. Palestine looks at CSOs as partners that may know information that they do&#13;
not have.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Hachmi Kennou started his career working on water pollution issues in France,&#13;
modellingwater resources management in the basins of the â&#128;&#156;Garonne and Adourâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
rivers. Afterwards, in Tunisia, he worked in the Urban Hydraulic Division of the Public&#13;
Works Ministry and started his career in urban sanitation and the protection of cities&#13;
against floods, before becoming Director and subsequently Chairman of the National&#13;
Sanitation Authority (ONAS) as well as General manager of two urban development&#13;
societies. Since 2002, Mr Hachmi Kennou is in charge of the General Secretary of the&#13;
Mediterranean Water Institute (IME), one of the most active professional water&#13;
networks in Mediterranean region. Mr Kennou was also elected Governor to the&#13;
World Council in 2003.&#13;

12. Conclusion: What does it take to set up regulation?&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;§   What are the sector's strengths to leverage when establishing a regulatory&#13;
       authority: a supportive line ministry? Strong political will? Civil society? All&#13;
       this will help decide what institutional configuration will work best for the&#13;
       country.&#13;
   ï&#130;§   The regulator should be backed by a coalition to manage change, which&#13;
       includes allies and engages opposition in a meaningful way.&#13;
   ï&#130;§   The regulator will need to overcome both systemic opposition, as well as&#13;
       opposition from people who may lose out from its establishment.&#13;
   ï&#130;§   The regulator should look for some short-term wins&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Don't finish setting up your regulatory authority too soon! Make sure you&#13;
       have a good system of checks and balances in place.&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Change sector culture so it accepts the system.&#13;
   ï&#130;§   Practice adaptive management: Think of next steps, reflect on what works&#13;
       well and what does not, and change focus if needs be.&#13;

13. The Utility Perspective: Public-Private Partnerships Under the French&#13;
Contractual Model&#13;
&#13;
Bill Kingdom, Global Water Sector Lead at the World Bank, moderated the discussion&#13;
between two panelists operating under the French model of delegated contracts for&#13;
services in the City of Marseille.&#13;
&#13;
The first panelist, Jean-Marc Mertz, described the City of Marseilleâ&#128;&#153;s role as the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;maÃ®tre dâ&#128;&#153;ouvrageâ&#128;&#157; in monitoring the various PPP contracts into which it has entered.&#13;
He explained that the Community of "Marseille Provence Metropole" (MPM)&#13;
approved, on the 8th of July 2011, the principle of delegating the exploitation of both&#13;
the drinkable water and the sanitation services through â&#128;&#156;leasingâ&#128;&#157;. There are four&#13;
contracts of public delegation : one concerning the public water service and three for&#13;
the public sanitation (East, Central, West). There were several main selection criteria,&#13;
including price, security of the resource, and service quality. He explained that there&#13;
is a â&#128;&#156;dedicated legal structure for each contractâ&#128;&#157;. He described the key Performance&#13;
Indicators (KPIs), and how sanctions are applied in the case of breach of contract, e.g.&#13;
penalties in case of non-achievement of the fixed objectives. An audit is performed&#13;
once a year, by an external and qualified auditor, based on the values production&#13;
process related to the previous year's data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       22&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Meyssonnier followed by describing the 15-year water contract (recently&#13;
renewed) between his company, Societe des Eaux de Marseille (SEM) of the Veolia&#13;
Group, and the City of Marseille. He described it as embodying the following&#13;
characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Performance based&#13;
   ï&#130;·   A new type of governance with more transparency and control for the city&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Technological innovations and higher service commitments&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Social development and sustainable development targets&#13;
   ï&#130;·   A shorter duration and a dedicated company&#13;
&#13;
Questions from the participants centered on:&#13;
   ï&#130;· Who implements/ executes the audits? Are they truly independent from the&#13;
      provider? How is the data verified?&#13;
   ï&#130;· How are disputes handled?&#13;
   ï&#130;· According to the OECD, prices in France are relatively higher than elsewhere&#13;
      in the OCED, and is this related to the risk in the contractual arrangements and&#13;
      the duration of the contracts?&#13;
   ï&#130;· What type of competition is there for the contracts in the first place?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Jean-Marc Mertz, technical engineer, began his career at the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
In 1984, he joined the technical services of City of Marseille where he held various&#13;
key positions notably in the following areas: climate engineering, fleet manager and&#13;
managing director for safety and prevention. In 2004, he joined the "Urban&#13;
Community of Marseille Provence Metropole" where he served as Deputy Director in&#13;
charge of urban ecology, Deputy Director in charge of waste management, General&#13;
Inspector and Deputy Director in charge of urban services. He now serves as Deputy&#13;
Director for water and yacht harbors management.&#13;
&#13;
Mr Alain Meyssonier joined the Marseille Water Company as Director of Foreign&#13;
Affairs and spent 20 years developing the activities of the Marseille Water Group at&#13;
the international level. He then was appointed Director of the Marseille Provence&#13;
Area in charge of the proper execution of the concessionary public-services contracts&#13;
for drinking water and sanitation signed with various Marseille Provence MÃ©tropole&#13;
municipalities until March 2014 when he took the position of Deputy General&#13;
Director in charge of the group's development in France and internationally. He is&#13;
also Chair of the Corsica Provence Committee of Foreign Trade Advisors of France. He&#13;
holds a MBA in Business Administration and Management from ESSEC Business&#13;
School.&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                   23&#13;
&amp;#12;14. Regulatory resources&#13;
&#13;
Mark Jamison described the Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation&#13;
(BoKIR) on which PURC is working jointly with the World Bank and PPIAF. He&#13;
provided a history of how the BoKIR was created and its purpose, as well as its&#13;
latest initiative to provide expertise on regulation in low-income and fragile /&#13;
conflict states.&#13;
&#13;
