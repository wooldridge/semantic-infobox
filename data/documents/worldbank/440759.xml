REPUBLIC OF NIGER&#13;
TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I.BACKGROUND&#13;
A.COUNTRYBACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Niger is a large landlocked country covering an area of 1.27 million Km2, and is 600 km&#13;
away from the closest seashore. The population estimated at 8.7 million in 1994-- about half of&#13;
which is less than 15 years old--is growing at about 3.3 percent a year which is above the average&#13;
for Sub-Saharan Africa. Social indicators are among the lowest in the Sahelian countries. The&#13;
human resource base is weak, with an adult literacy rate of only 14 percent (9 percent among&#13;
women) and a primary school enrollment ratio of less than 30 percent. Life expectancy at birth is&#13;
47 years, one of the lowest on the continent, and infant and child mortality rates are high. The&#13;
natural resource base is fragile due to low and irregular rainfall and low and declining soil&#13;
fertility. As a result, Niger's fast growing population is becoming one of the poorest in the&#13;
world. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) has declined by more than 52 percent since&#13;
1980, reaching US$176 in 1994. Niger has an open economy, with imports and exports&#13;
exceeding 30 percent of GDP. Strong trade links exist with Nigeria, which exerts considerable&#13;
economic influence through long-standing trading and cultural bonds.&#13;
2.    Besides the weak natural resource base, Niger faces additional constraints in the form of&#13;
high factor costs, overdependence on uranium, a relatively inefficient public sector and a small&#13;
modem private sector. The fall of uranium prices in 1981 has resulted in severe financial&#13;
imbalances and triggered a long-term economic decline. The devaluation of the CFA franc in&#13;
January 1994 has given Niger an opportunity to resume its economic growth. Political instability,&#13;
however, has prevented the country from taking full advantage of the devaluation. Eventually,&#13;
the Government reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund on an Enhanced&#13;
Structural Adjustment Facility program in June 1996. IDA approved a one-tranche adjustment&#13;
credit on March 20, 1997.&#13;
3.    Poverty remains critical in Niger. 63 percent of Nigeriens (5.3 million people) earn&#13;
incomes below the poverty threshold defined by the Government. About 34 percent (2.8 million&#13;
people) are classified as extremely poor. Urban/rural differentials are stark, with average rural&#13;
incomes being half those in urban areas. The participatory poverty assessment carried out in&#13;
1996 (Report no. 15344-NIR, June 28, 1996) pictures vividly poverty in Niger:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                     Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(a)   Urban areas: Poverty is hunger. Ownership of goods is a form of safety net rather&#13;
than money. Being employed is what matters. Women earn revenues through&#13;
petty trade, mostly the sale of cooked food. They take care of the family when&#13;
men lose their jobs. Squatting neglected areas saves the cost of renting houses.&#13;
Recently, the number of beggars has increased in Niamey, and "traditional"&#13;
beggars have been joined by large numbers of younger people.&#13;
(b)   Rural areas: Access to land is a major constraint because of the dearth of fertile&#13;
land and competition exists among groups to exploit natural resources.&#13;
Households exchange young children: families with many children send older&#13;
children to help families who do not have enough labor force and receive younger&#13;
children. Diversification of income sources is a necessary strategy because of the&#13;
climatic risks, but the poor have little possibilities available. Migration is a&#13;
survival strategy, the poor migrate to look for food and work within Niger or to&#13;
neighboring countries. Remittances contribute to the income of those in the&#13;
household who have stayed in their villages. During the dry season, Niamey's&#13;
population is estimated to increase by 100,000 dwellers.&#13;
4.    Putting the country back onto a development path requires the pursuit of the reform&#13;
agenda, including private sector development and restructuring of the public expenditures to&#13;
improve basic education and health services coverage. Government's commitment and action on&#13;
key reforms, the return to political stability and the resumption of donor assistance are critical for&#13;
the reforTn program. Sustained success depends on continued fiscal discipline and the increase of&#13;
investments to rekindle growth, especially in satisfying the large needs in social infrastructure.&#13;
To pursue its reform agenda, Niger critically needs to regain donors' confidence through an&#13;
effective transition to democracy. External aid is progressively resuming after several important&#13;
donors suspended budgetary aid in reaction to the military takeover in late January 1996. A&#13;
Presidential election was held in July 1996 and legislative elections in November 24, 1996.&#13;
B. TRANSPORT SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
5.    The following paragraphs describe the transport sector and identify the most important&#13;
issues. Government actions and decisions listed in the paragraphs are taken from the Letter of&#13;
Sector Policy prepared by the Government for the 1998-2000 period (Annex 2). The Letter was&#13;
signed by the Government before Board presentation.&#13;
6.    Road Maintenance. The Government is committed to improve highway management and&#13;
road transport perfornance to promote Niger's economic competitiveness. The interurban road&#13;
network consists of 14,000 km of roads, including 3,500 km of paved roads. The urban road&#13;
network is estimated to be 840 km long, of which 25 percent is paved. Road maintenance&#13;
performance has deteriorated during the past five years, mostly because of a lack of incentives,&#13;
salary arrears, low availability of equipment (about 60 per cent for heavy equipment), insufficient&#13;
financing, and cumbersome procedures. Because of lack of resources, the Government has&#13;
concentrated its maintenance effort on a priority network of about 7,656 km. About 55 percent of&#13;
paved roads and 44 percent of earth roads are in poor condition. Most roads not recently built or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                     3&#13;
maintained with external financing are now 9- to 1 0-years old, and periodic maintenance is&#13;
crucial now to preserve road assets and prevent costly rehabilitation in the future.&#13;
7.    The sector is managed by the Ministry of Equipment and Infrastructure (MEI). The&#13;
Public Works Department (DTP) has a staff of about 1,400 employees. MEI does not have a&#13;
clear procedure to establish road maintenance and rehabilitation programs. A road data bank was&#13;
set up under the Transport Sector Project (TSP, Cr. 1706-NIR closed on June 30, 1993). The&#13;
data bank was maintained as long as the TSP was effective, but data have not been regularly&#13;
collected since project completion. However, MEI's staff was trained to operate the data bank&#13;
which was used for the preparation and the economic analysis of the proposed Project, after more&#13;
recent data on road conditions were collected. The strategy which provides the basis for&#13;
establishing road maintenance programs by using the road data bank needs to be updated by&#13;
changing working methods and works standards and taking into account budget constraints, as&#13;
well as lessons learned from the experience of road maintenance in Niger during the past ten&#13;
years. The new strategy is expected to be available by December 1998, based on terms of&#13;
reference available in the project files. The objective is to define several economically-justified&#13;
maintenance scenarios based on different sets of maintenance standards and chose the scenario&#13;
which best fits within the resources available. The definition of the new strategy will give the&#13;
opportunity to replace the existing data bank developed ten years ago with a software which is no&#13;
longer on the market. The project will also purchase equipment to help MEI to collect data and&#13;
monitor road conditions.&#13;
8.    Lack of resources for road maintenance hampers the sustainability of investments in the&#13;
highway sector. The 1997 operating budget, excluding salaries of civil servants in DTP,&#13;
amounted to CFAF 3.1 billion (Annex 3). The resources budgeted are insufficient to maintain the&#13;
priority network. The necessary budget, excluding salaries, is estimated at CFAF 4 billion&#13;
(Annex 3) for only routine maintenance (CFAF 3 billion), some emergency operations (CFAF&#13;
775 million) and the operating costs of the Public Works Department (CFAF 240 million). The&#13;
Government has decided to increase the 1998 budget by 18 percent to CFAF 3.7 billion in a&#13;
effort to fill the gap between resources available and those required. However, resources will still&#13;
lack for periodic maintenance of both the paved and unpaved networks. The present project is&#13;
expected to cover part of the deficit for the unpaved roads, but there are no immediate prospects&#13;
of new resources for the paved roads, other than those under an African Development Bank&#13;
project suspended since 1994, which would cover 136 km of roads. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government agreed to prepare annual budgets for road maintenance in consultation with IDA.&#13;
9.    A 1991 study shows that maintenance costs were not covered by tax revenues generated&#13;
by the transport sector. The main reason is the use of smuggled gasoline from Nigeria, which&#13;
results in loss of taxes collected from petroleum products. The following table details costs and&#13;
revenues per category of transport. Maintenance costs included costs for routine maintenance&#13;
estimated at that time at CFAF 2.7 billion, costs for periodic maintenance estimated at CFAF 4.9&#13;
billion and administration costs estimated at CFAF 795 million. Since 1991, road tolls have been&#13;
introduced to improve cost recovery, but revenues have been uneven: about CFAF 300 million,&#13;
one third of expected revenues, until 1995; and CFAF 600 million in 1996. Even fully recovered,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                     Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
revenues from road tolls would not balance maintenance costs and revenues from the transport&#13;
sector.&#13;

10.   To sustain road maintenance financing, the Government intends to create a Road&#13;
Maintenance Fund according to the four following principles: (a) involvement of road users in its&#13;
management; (b) carrying out by external independent auditors of technical and financial audits&#13;
of road maintenance programs financed by the Fund; (c) commercial management of the Fund;&#13;
and (d) to the extent possible, resources collected from road users. The Government's decision in&#13;
March 1997 to create, as a transitory period before the Road Fund, a Road Maintenance Account&#13;
with resources allocated from the Treasury failed to achieve its objective as the Government was&#13;
unable to allocate resources to the account. This failure emphasizes the need to create the Road&#13;
Fund according to the four principles above. In addition to securing resources, the Fund will&#13;
accelerate payment to contractors, who have difficulty to survive the long payment delays which&#13;
are typical of the normal procedure through the Treasury. It will also irnprove transparency in the&#13;
management of public resources. The project will finance annual financial audits of the Road&#13;
Fund and annual technical audits of the road maintenance program executed with Government&#13;
budget's financing. Terms of reference for the technical audits are in the project files. During&#13;
negotiations, the Government agreed to implement before January 1, 1999, a mechanism to&#13;
finance road maintenance based on the four principles above. The type of user charges and their&#13;
collection process will be defined in a study included in the project. The study will consider a&#13;
revision of the road tolls system, which is a potential source of revenues for the Fund. Terms of&#13;
reference are in the project files. The study will also consider the possibility of using road&#13;
network management contracts, for some specific roads, under which a private operator would&#13;
receive the right to collect tolls and in turn be responsible to maintain roads to established&#13;
standards.&#13;
I11    To improve efficiency, the Government has decided to progressively disengage from road&#13;
maintenance execution and use civil works contractors instead. MEI should focus on planning,&#13;
programming, budgeting and supervision of works. Presently, routine maintenance is still&#13;
carried out by force account. Periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and some emergency&#13;
interventions are contracted out. The Government has agreed that, by 2000, all routine&#13;
maintenance will be contracted out except in areas under army control. In 1997, in addition to&#13;
operating expenditures used for emergency operations and usually carried out by local&#13;
contractors, part of the Government's budget has already been used for routine maintenance&#13;
operations by local contractors. DTP will be restructured to reflect these changes before January&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                     5&#13;
1, 1999. The terms of reference of the study to define the new structure for DTP are in the project&#13;
files. Training activities will be identified as part of the study. The project will also provide&#13;
resources for short-term missions of experts to assist DTP in managing the implementation of the&#13;
new framework for road maintenance.&#13;
12.   To improve efficiency of public works equipment rental activities, the Government has&#13;
agreed to transform its equipment pool into a privately managed equipment rental company. The&#13;
new statute should be implemented before January 1, 1999. Force account brigades use public&#13;
works equipment managed by a department of MEI (Direction du Materiel des Travaux Publics -&#13;
DMTP), which has 670 employees and maintains 885 pieces of equipment and vehicles. DMTP's&#13;
performance has been low for three reasons: (a) difficulties to access to funds budgeted for the&#13;
renewal of equipment; (b) cumbersome administrative procedures which prevent to purchase&#13;
spare parts when required; and (c) lack of incentives for staff. DMTP's budget is a separate&#13;
budget in the Government's budget. It amounted to CFAF 3.1 billion in 1997 (Annex 3). About&#13;
CFAF 1.5 billion were revenues from equipment rental to the Department of Public Works and&#13;
corresponding expenditures were almost entirely disbursed. CFAF 1.3 billion were budgeted for&#13;
the renewal of equipment but almost none of these resources were used. Terms of reference of&#13;
the financial adviser who will assist the Government in the establishment of the new privately&#13;
managed equipment rental company are in the project files. The project will also finance&#13;
rehabilitation of some equipment to facilitate the start of the new company. The technical&#13;
expertise to appraise rehabilitation requirements and prepare bidding documents will be provided&#13;
under the contract of the fmancial adviser.&#13;
13.   The Road Laboratory should change its statute in order to become autonomous and&#13;
fmancially viable. The Road Laboratory is a department of MEI, with 70 employees. It is&#13;
responsible for the geotechnical supervision of road works. The Road Laboratory uses a Special&#13;
Account in the Government's budget. Although the Special Account was created to facilitate the&#13;
Laboratory's operations, the revenues generated by supervising road works on external financing&#13;
and for services rendered to private entrepreneurs, are transferred to the Treasury, which keeps&#13;
them for other purposes. Then, the resources cannot be used by the Laboratory to finance its&#13;
operating costs and renew its equipment. The Laboratory's 1997 budget amounted to CFAF 109&#13;
million, 91 percent being for salaries. The Laboratory's statute should be changed before January&#13;
1, 1999. Terms of reference to define the new structure are in the project files.&#13;
14.   Rural Roads. Development of the rural road network has been unsustainable due to lack&#13;
of funds for its maintenance. The network is 1,250 km long, mostly entirely built with IDA&#13;
financing under the Feeder Road Project (Cr. 886-NIR, closed on June 30, 1987) and the&#13;
Transport Sector Project (TSP, Cr. 1706-NIR, closed on June 30, 1993). Rural roads were built&#13;
by force account with high standards similar to those on the primary network, although&#13;
supporting much less traffic. About 1,500 km of new roads were identified on the basis of their&#13;
economic justification during the preparation of a new feeder road project later canceled.&#13;
15.   There is a high demand for the construction of new roads as demonstrated by several&#13;
examples where population have contributed in cash to finance force account brigades to build&#13;
new roads or rehabilitate existing roads. The Government is attentive to this demand and is&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

seeking financing to extend the rural road network in areas which lack access. However, it is also&#13;
conscious that resources being insufficient to maintain the existing network, a new strategy has&#13;
to be defined to make investments in the rural road network sustainable. As part of the&#13;
Government's decentralization policy, responsibility for the maintenance of the tertiary network&#13;
which includes rural roads would be given to local governments. Although the Ministry of&#13;
Equipment and Infrastructure has prepared a draft decree in this direction, the decree cannot be&#13;
implemented as long as the overall framework for decentralization is not put in place. The&#13;
Government has requested to include in the project a rural component with the objective of&#13;
defining a new strategy aiming at sustaining maintenance of rural roads. Implementation of the&#13;
strategy would be tested through a pilot operation included in the project. The pilot operation&#13;
would cover about 150 km of rural roads. Terms of reference of the consultant which will assist&#13;
the Government in the definition of the new strategy in consultation with beneficiaries and the&#13;
preparation of the pilot operation to validate the strategy are in the project files.&#13;
16.   Road Transport. Niger is heavily dependent on road transport, both for its domestic&#13;
freight and passenger movements, and for cross-border traffic. The latter consists of formal and&#13;
informal (and unrecorded) trade flows with neighboring countries (mostly Benin, Togo and&#13;
Nigeria but also Burkina, Ghana and C6te d'Ivoire), and transit transport of maritime imports and&#13;
exports. The following table summarizes the 1995 and 1996 statistical data on regional and&#13;
international cargo flows to and from Niger (by transport corridor). However, actual cargo flows&#13;
are higher, as there is much unrecorded trade with some neighboring countries, especially with&#13;
Nigeria.&#13;

n.a.: not available. The split between regional and maritime transit traffic in the&#13;
Togo/Burkina corridor is not known.&#13;
17.   The Government has little intervention in the sector as a result of measures taken to&#13;
liberalize the sector. Price regulation was abolished in 1994 except for the transport of petroleum&#13;
products. Access to the industry is unrestricted. In 1996, the Government abolished the&#13;
monopoly granted to the national road transport company (Societe Nationale des Transports du&#13;
Niger, SNTN) to transport the freight of mining companies. SNTN is being restructured with&#13;
interurban transport activities transferred to a private company created in 1994, and urban&#13;
transport activities transferred to a company created in December 1996 and jointly owned by&#13;
Niamey's municipality, the State and private investors. SNTN itself will remain as a semi-private&#13;
freight transport company jointly owned by the State and a foreign private freightforwarder.&#13;
Completion of SNTN's restructuring has been delayed because of lack of financing for severance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                      7&#13;
payment of redundant staff, but is expected before end of March 1998, with the assistance of&#13;
external financing.&#13;
18.   Despite these efforts, high transport costs are a major constraint to Niger's development&#13;
due to restrictive practices by the road transport industry. Independent from the Government, the&#13;
road transport union (Syndicat des Transporteurs Routiers du Niger, STRN) has established a&#13;
system to allocate among operators public domestic passenger traffic, and also international&#13;
freight in the Benin and Togo corridors. This has several negative effects on the economy: (a)&#13;
tariffs set by STRN are two-third above those practiced by Beninese truckers, which cannot be&#13;
explained only because Niger is a landlocked country; (b) the system prevents contractual&#13;
relationships between shippers and truck owners; (c) implementation of the system is distorted in&#13;
favor of large fleet owners; (d) although tariffs are high, the profitability of the activity remains&#13;
low as the traffic is shared among numerous operators which do not carry out enough trips to&#13;
make the activity profitable. For high-value cargo, shippers may use SNTN who charges higher&#13;
tariffs and provides a better quality of service. This is possible on all routes, including those&#13;
international corridors which are subject to the allocation system enforced by STRN (Benin and&#13;
Togo corridors). On domestic routes and other international corridors, shippers can also use the&#13;
service of a few other higher-quality operators.&#13;
19.   Freight transport services are provided by about 700 operators. The vehicle fleet consists&#13;
of about 1,300 trailers with a 25-ton payload, 400 smaller trucks, most of them very old, which&#13;
are mainly used for occasional domestic transport of low-value cargo. About 5 operators own&#13;
fleets between 50 and 100 trucks. SNTN owns more than 300 trucks. Many truck operators are&#13;
also traders and shift between transport and trade according to market conditions. Only SNTN&#13;
and a few other operators are formal transport companies. The large majority of operators is&#13;
informal and mostly of a low educational background. They do not operate out of established&#13;
premises, do not have vehicle servicing and repair workshops, and also do not have a clear notion&#13;
of vehicle operating costs. For the past ten years, almost all newly registered trucks have been&#13;
second-hand vehicles which are between 8- and 12-year old. The cost of these vehicles is about&#13;
10 percent of a new unit. This results of the low profitability of the activity, because of which&#13;
operators do not have enough resources to invest in new costly vehicles and prefer to buy&#13;
imported second-hand vehicles instead. However, despite the high average age of the fleet, there&#13;
are few complaints about the quality of transport services. A sign of confidence in the services&#13;
provided is the readiness of insurance companies to cover the risks of cargo loss or damage&#13;
during road transport, at a reasonable rate.&#13;
20.   The allocation system is also applied to passenger transport and negatively affects the&#13;
safety and comfort of passengers. Passengers are not allowed to choose between buses in fair or&#13;
poor condition. Interurban passenger transport is provided by about 900 individual operators,&#13;
most of which own one or two vehicles. The fleet consists of some 550 taxis, about 1,000&#13;
minibuses with a capacity between 17 and 22 passengers, and about 150 larger buses. Cars which&#13;
operate on international routes are particularly in poor condition. SNTN operates large buses and&#13;
is the single big operator. Characteristics of operators are similar to those of freight transport&#13;
operators described above.&#13;
&#13;

21.   When road tolls being constructed in Benin on the road between Cotonou and Parakou&#13;
are in service, road freight services will be authorized and the monopoly granted to the joint&#13;
Benin-Niger institution (Organisation Commune Benin-Niger, OCBN), for transit traffic on the&#13;
Benin-Niger corridor, will disappear. Construction of road tolls has started but completion&#13;
expected in December 1996 has been delayed and is now expected before the end of 1997. The&#13;
operator of the road tolls has already been selected. OCBN operates the Beninese railway from&#13;
Cotonou to Parakou and contracts out road transport from Parakou to Niger to a pool of truckers.&#13;
The contracting procedure and the monopoly facilitate the freight allocation system. In addition&#13;
to freight traffic, the railway carries a substantial volume of passengers. Passenger traffic is most&#13;
likely to be subsidized by freight traffic, though this cannot be substantiated because of the poor&#13;
accounting practices in OCBN. Thus, Niger would bear, through rail freight tariffs, a portion of&#13;
the subsidy to the transport of mainly Beninese passengers on the railway. Because privatization&#13;
of OCBN is supported by the Nigerien Government, but not fully by the Beninese Government,&#13;
the Nigerien Government does not have full autonomy in the decision and no timetable has been&#13;
agreed yet. A joint meeting between the Beninese and Nigerien Governments and donors is&#13;
envisaged in 1998 to support the decision process regarding the privatization of OCBN.&#13;
22.   The Government is committed to eliminate the stranglehold of the road haulage cartel and&#13;
discourage the use of the allocation system. It intends, with the project's assistance, to sensitize&#13;
the road transport industry to the issues described above and launch discussions with STRN to&#13;
replace the bus allocation system by schedules, which would let passengers decide on the vehicle&#13;
they prefer to take. Among the sensitization activities, will be presented the link between poverty&#13;
and transport, which will be studied as part of the project activities. The Government, with the&#13;
project's assistance, will improve technical control of vehicles to remove those which are in the&#13;
poorest condition. Some of these vehicles remain in use only to capture a larger share of the&#13;
freight through the allocation system although they do not actually transport this freight. Terms&#13;
of reference for the improvement of technical control of vehicles are in the project files.&#13;
Disappearance of OCBN's monopoly and the rehabilitation of the road between Togo and Niger&#13;
included in the IDA's Transport Sector Project in Togo approved by the Board in early FY98&#13;
will increase competition and are expected to result in the disappearance of the freight allocation&#13;
system.&#13;
23.  In 1990, the Government prepared a plan of action to improve road safety. However, the&#13;
cost of the plan estimated at about US$4 million was out of proportion with the Government's&#13;
capacity to finance it. Because the Departmnent of Land Transport (DTT) in the Ministry of&#13;
Transport does not collect data on road accidents, the only information on accidents date from&#13;
1990. That year, about 500 people had been killed, 1,000 people had suffered heavy injuries and&#13;
3,000 people light injuries. Road accidents had been estimated to cost about CFAF 2 billion to&#13;
the economy. DTT's capacity needs to be strengthened to be able to analyze and use efficiently&#13;
information on accidents. The institutional framework needs to be revised to improve&#13;
collaboration between public and private institutions involved in the sector. Terms of reference&#13;
for the preparation of the plan are in the project files.&#13;
24.   Maritime Transport. The application of the 40-40-20 rule (UNCTAD Code of Conduct)&#13;
for cargo sharing is an additional burden on international transport. The rule is administered by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                     9&#13;
the Shippers' Council (Conseil Nigerien des Utilisateurs des Transports, CNUT), which has 48&#13;
employees. The 40-40-20 rule now prevents the reduction of maritime freight rates at a time&#13;
when those are decreasing throughout the rest of the world. The rule has also failed to promote&#13;
the development of national shipping lines in Africa, which was one of its objectives. Besides,&#13;
the enforcement and administration of the rule adds an average of US$3 per ton to transport and&#13;
transit costs, which is partly to cover CNUT's operating costs. Maritime traffic allocated to the&#13;
Nigerien shipping line (Compagnie maritime du Niger, COMANI, a Non-Vessel Operating&#13;
Common Carrier) is reassigned to other shipping lines, which in turn grant discounts to&#13;
COMANI. The Government has decided to liberalize maritime transport by June 1998 giving&#13;
shippers the freedom to chose their shipping lines for maritime transport. The CNUT is being&#13;
restructured and its role redefined. The project will provide support to the creation of a National&#13;
Observatory of Transport in which the CNUT would participate with private sector stakeholders.&#13;
CNUT's services should be remunerated on the basis of their costs under commercial contracts.&#13;
25.   Civil Aviation. The Government is negotiating with ASECNA, the Air Safety Agency for&#13;
Africa and Madagascar, to transfer airport management to the Agency. Nigerien airports are&#13;
currently managed by ANAC, the public Civil Aviation Agency. The Agency has 334 staff, 100&#13;
above what is required. The Department of Civil Aviation in the Ministry of Transport regulates&#13;
the sector. The main airport is Niamey with about 130,000 annual passengers, mostly&#13;
international. ASECNA is currently responsible for air traffic control. Although reliable&#13;
information is unavailable, financial statements for Niamey's airport would be expected to be&#13;
balanced. Because of a low level of traffic, those for secondary airports would show a deficit.&#13;
Cross-subsidization between airports would be unacceptable if the amount of the cross-subsidy is&#13;
too high, because it would make Niamey's airport unattractive especially for tourism.&#13;
26.   Highway Investment and Maintenance Program. The Program for the 1998-2000 period&#13;
(see Table 3) totals about CFAF81 billion distributed into CFAF70 billion for investrnent and&#13;
CFAFl  billion for maintenance. The Government contribution is estimated at about CFAF14&#13;
billion or 17 percent.&#13;
Table 3: 1998-2000 Highway Investment and Maintenance Program (CFAF billion)&#13;

With the proposed project, the Government plans to include 12 highway projects in the&#13;
1998-2000 Public Investment Program (PIP) (Annex 4) which will be submitted to the National&#13;
Assembly's approval at the end of 1997. The IDA project represents 21 percent of the investment&#13;
program. The PIP for the highway sector represents 21 percent of the overall PIP for the 1998-&#13;
2000 period, up from 15.6 percent in 1997. For 1998 only, this percentage amounts to 15 percent.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government agreed that annual PIPs will be prepared in consultation&#13;
with IDA.&#13;

C. PREvious BANK EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
27.   The experience under the Transport Sector Project (TSP) calls for a strong consensus&#13;
between the Borrower and donors on objectives for any new project in the sector. This consensus&#13;
was reached with the new Government which came on power early 1996. The TSP's&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (PCR, Report No. 13773, December 9, 1994) also&#13;
recommends to establish a road maintenance policy based on economic criteria, to strengthen&#13;
road management capacities and to reactivate road management tools, all activities which are&#13;
included in the proposed project. The PCR for the Feeder Roads Project (Report No. 7739, April&#13;
28, 1989) emphasizes the need to address lack of funds for rural road maintenance, which&#13;
hampered the Project's sustainability.&#13;
28.   A review of the IDA portfolio was held with Nigerien and IDA project managers in May&#13;
1997 to discuss generic issues and provide recommendations. Four themes were identified: (a)&#13;
the project's environment, the conditions for success and the participation of beneficiaries; (b)&#13;
programming of project's activities, monitoring and assessment of outcome; (c) project&#13;
management; and (d) project's institutional framework. Recommendations were related to:&#13;
(a)   on the Government' side: (i) define sector strategies; (ii) include counterpart funds&#13;
in the quarterly cash-flow management at the Treasury; (iii) strengthen the local&#13;
capacity in the ministries for planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting; (iv)&#13;
revise the national procurement code and identify obstacles hamnpering the&#13;
procurement process; and (v) avoid project specific conditions for effectiveness;&#13;
(b)   on IDA's side: (i) strengthen the role of the Resident Mission, especially for&#13;
procurement; and (ii) revise the amounts in the Special Accounts.&#13;
D. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
29.   The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
discussed by the Board on November 11, 1997. In a context where reduction of poverty, although&#13;
an overarching objective, is unlikely to be achievable in the medium term, IDA's assistance&#13;
would focus on three core areas with the following broad objectives:&#13;
Core area of IDA assistance              Broad objective&#13;
Human capital development                Expand the coverage of basic education and health&#13;
services&#13;
Improved management of water             Increase access to safe drinking water and promote&#13;
sustainable water management in agriculture&#13;
Promotion of open economic policies and regional  Foster a favorable business climate, including&#13;
linkages                                 further development of links with Nigeria&#13;
30.   The proposed project will be part of the third area of IDA assistance. It will support state&#13;
divestiture and removal of regulatory bottlenecks in the transport sector while contributing to&#13;
providing and maintaining basic road infrastructure. The project will also contribute to mitigate&#13;
the impact of an harsh environment on the poor especially through the rural road component of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                  11&#13;
the project as poverty is critical in rural areas and evidence suggests that poverty is growing in&#13;
Niger. The project will help develop a strategy for rural road maintenance to sustain the&#13;
development of the rural road network. Also, although improvement of road maintenance&#13;
efficiency has not a direct impact on poverty reduction, it will prevent an increase in poverty&#13;
which would result of high transport costs caused by roads in poor condition due to lack of&#13;
maintenance.&#13;

creation of public works equipment rental companies.&#13;
C. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
34.   The total project cost is estimated at US$30.5 million. IDA's contribution will amount to&#13;
US$28.0 million and the Government's contribution to US$2.5 million. In addition, the&#13;
Government will finance salaries of civil servants in NBC and some operating costs of NBC. The&#13;
annual contribution is estimated at US$10,000. Table 4 summarizes the distribution of project&#13;
costs per component and foreign currency, local currency and taxes. Project costs are detailed in&#13;

35.   IDA will finance US$5.6 million of expenditures in local currency. This is justified by&#13;
the relatively high share of expenditures in local currency in civil works on earth and rural roads&#13;
(64 percent for personnel and 24 percent for inputs) as well as by the amount of training&#13;
activities or consulting services carried out locally. Local consultants have proved to be&#13;
competitive under the PPF for engineering services because of the low technology of civil works&#13;
executed under the project as well as for audit, legal, survey or sensitization services. The&#13;
Government will finance taxes and duties on all contracts. The project is exempt of custom duties&#13;
on imported professional equipment. Counterpart funds for the earth road rehabilitation&#13;
component will be deposited in a commercial bank on a Project Account managed by the&#13;
National Bureau of Coordination prior to the signature of any works contract financed from the&#13;
credit. This account will be audited as part of the project activities. The Project Account should&#13;
be opened and an initial amount of CFAF 20 million corresponding to counterpart funds for&#13;
equipment to be purchased in 1998 should be deposited in the account before effectiveness.&#13;
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
36.   The Prime Ministry will be responsible for the overall coordination of the project through&#13;
the project's Steering Committee and the National Bureau of Coordination. The Steering&#13;
Committee coordinates both transport and urban (Cr. 2957-NIR approved by the Board on May&#13;
29, 1997) infiastructure rehabilitation projects. It is composed of representatives of the Prime&#13;
Ministry, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Infrastructure and Equipment,&#13;
Ministry of Transport, and the Secretary to Decentralization and Administrative Reform. NBC&#13;
has coordinated project preparation. It was created under the Ministry of Planning by ministerial&#13;
order in July 1996, then transferred under the Prime Ministry in January 1997. NBC's staff&#13;
consists of one civil servant, who is chief of the Bureau, and one accountant under contract.&#13;
NBC's chief has performed his duties satisfactorily; he is well accepted by other executing&#13;
agencies. Depending on the activity, sub-conmmittees composed of staff from the Steering&#13;
Committee and from executing agencies will be responsible for procurement under the project.&#13;
Procurement activities carried out under the PPF have demonstrated a satisfactory performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                   Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
of members in procurement committees. Training in procurement is being provided with PPF&#13;
resources to further improve this performance.&#13;
37.   The Public Works Department in MEI will be responsible for the highway component of&#13;
the project, including road maintenance strategy studies, engineering studies and execution of the&#13;
earth road regraveling prograrn and the rural road pilot operation included in the project.&#13;
Environmental activities related to road works will be under the responsibility of the Service for&#13;
environmental impact studies in the Public Works Department. The National Council of&#13;
Environment for Sustainable Development and the Department of Environment in the Ministry&#13;
of Hydraulics and Environment will advise MEI regarding environment-related activities. DMTP&#13;
and LNTPB will be responsible for the project activities which concern their departments. The&#13;
Department of Land Transport will be responsible for road transport studies. The National&#13;
Council of Environrent for Sustainable Development and the Department of Environment in the&#13;
Ministry of Hydraulics and Environment will be responsible for non-road specific environment-&#13;
related activities (para. 32 (e) above). The National Bureau of Coordination will manage the&#13;
project accounts, ensure a timely provision of financial audits, and be responsible for reporting&#13;
on project progress.&#13;
38.   A Project Implementation Plan was drafted before appraisal and is available in the project&#13;
files. The plan includes all procedures for the execution and the management of the project&#13;
(procurement, disbursement), the project's content and objectives, detailed project costs, terms of&#13;
reference of studies, standard forms of progress reports. The plan was formally adopted by the&#13;
Government before Board presentation. The plan also includes an implementation schedule for&#13;
the project activities (Annex 6). The schedule was prepared on the assumption that the credit&#13;
would become effective on March 31, 1998.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
39.   During negotiations, the Borrower agreed to the procurement procedures described&#13;
hereafter, which are part of the project implementation plan. All goods and works financed&#13;
under the IDA credit will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised January 1996 and August 1996).&#13;
Consultants will be selected in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers, and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (January 1997). Table 5&#13;
summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs and procurement methods.&#13;
Procurement of Civil Works&#13;
40.   All contracts for the rehabilitation of earth roads and the construction of rural roads will&#13;
be awarded based on ICB in accordance with IDA's procurement guidelines. All ICBs will be&#13;
advertised in national newspapers and in Development Business. Bank Group's standard bidding&#13;
documents (Passation des marches de travaux-Droit civil, September 1996) will be mandatory.&#13;
Draft bidding documents are available and are being reviewed by IDA. A 7.5 percent margin of&#13;
preference may be granted in the evaluation of bids to domestic contractors. Contracts specifying&#13;
completion time more than 18 months will provide for a price adjustment clause. All bids will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                                15&#13;
be opened in public. Evaluation criteria will be included in the standard bidding docurnents.&#13;
Contract negotiation will not be permitted. The contracts will be awarded to the lowest evaluated&#13;
responsive bidder.&#13;

Note: Figures in parentheses are the amounts financed by the IDA Credit.&#13;
Rem: Figures may not add up to total due to rounding.&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
41.   Goods (spare parts for rehabilitation of public works equipment) estimated to cost the&#13;
equivalent of US$70,000 equivalent or more per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to&#13;
exceed US$360,000 will be procured by ICB. Tenders will be advertised in a national&#13;
newspaper and in Development Business. Use of standard bidding documents is mandatory.&#13;
Goods (cars, computers and related equipment) estimated to cost less than US$70,000 equivalent&#13;
per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$325,000 equivalent may be procured&#13;
under contracts awarded on the basis of NCB, advertised locally, in accordance with procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA, including: (a) bids will be opened in public in the presence of bidders or their&#13;
representatives; (b) there will be no negotiation with bidders between bid opening and contract&#13;
award; (c) bid evaluation and post-qualification criteria will be defined in precise quantitative&#13;
and monetary terms; and (d) award will be made to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.&#13;
Standard bidding documents for NCB should be prepared before credit effectiveness. The&#13;
software for the road data bank, the equipment for road roughness measurement, and automatic&#13;
traffic counters, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$151,000 may be procured using&#13;
Limited International Bidding (LIB) by soliciting bids from qualified suppliers. For ICB, a 15&#13;
percent margin of preference may be granted in the evaluation of bids offering domestically&#13;
manufactured goods.&#13;

16                                    Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Employment of Consultants&#13;
42.   For complex, time-based assignments, lump-sum contracts and individual consultants, the&#13;
Borrower will employ such consultants under contracts, using the standard forms of contract for&#13;
consultants' services issued by the Bank Group, with such modifications as shall have been&#13;
agreed by IDA. Where no relevant standard procurement documents have been issued by the&#13;
Bank Group, the Borrower will use other forms agreed with IDA prior to inviting proposals.&#13;
Three contracts for the project audits totaling US$149,000 will be awarded using the least-cost&#13;
selection method in accordance with pare. 3.6 of the Guidelines. Twelve contracts totaling&#13;
US$500,000 will be awarded to individual consultants selected in accordance with Section 5 of&#13;
the Guidelines. Other contracts will be awarded using the quality- and cost-based selection&#13;
method in accordance with paras. 3.2 to 3.4 of the Guidelines. The method per contract is&#13;
detailed in annex 5.&#13;
Review by IDA of Procurement Decisions&#13;
43.   Prior review by IDA of bid and contract documents will be required for: (a) consultant&#13;
services estimated to cost more than US$100,000 equivalent for firms (three contracts) and&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultants (one consultant); (b) individual consultants&#13;
selected for short-term support to the Public Works Department, the technical audit of road&#13;
maintenance works, and assessment of public works equipment; (c) civil works contracts above&#13;
US$250,000 equivalent (about six contracts) and goods contracts above US$70,000 equivalent&#13;
(two contracts). Documentation for contracts under these thresholds will be maintained for ex-&#13;
post reviews by auditors and IDA supervisory staff. For the selection of consultants, prior review&#13;
will be required for terms of reference, single-source hiring of consulting firms, amendments of&#13;
contracts raising the contract value above US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individual&#13;
consultants. For all civil works contracts for which there are less than five bidders or for any&#13;
decision not to select the lowest evaluated bidder, the Borrower will submit its proposal to IDA&#13;
for no-objection prior to notifying the winning bidder.&#13;
Additional Arrangements&#13;
44.   Contracts will be awarded within the agreed bid validity period and only exceptionally,&#13;
bid validity extension may be requested. In the case of fixed price contracts, requests for second&#13;
and subsequent extensions will be permissible only if the request for extension provides for an&#13;
appropriate adjustment mechanism of the quoted price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs for&#13;
the contract over the period of extension.&#13;
Procurement Times&#13;
45.   Procurement processing times for major steps up to contract signing were agreed during&#13;
negotiations. For consultants, time between the transmission of the letter of invitation and the&#13;
deadline for the submission of proposals should not be less than 45 days. Time between the&#13;
deadline for the submission of proposals and contract's signature should not exceed 120 days.&#13;
For goods and works, time between notification of the tender or availability of bidding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                              17&#13;
documents, whichever is later, and deadline for submission of bids should not be less than 45&#13;
days. Time between the opening of bids and contract's signature should not exceed 120 days. A&#13;
timetable for the preparation of bidding documents for works, goods and services is included in&#13;
the Project Implementation Plan. A first General Procurement Notice is being prepared to be&#13;
issued before effectiveness. General Procurement Notices should be updated annually.&#13;
F. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
46.   Annex 5 provides the estimated annual financial commitments for the project during the&#13;
1997/2001 period. 1997 expenditures were made using PPF funds. The project is expected to be&#13;
completed within a five-year period by July 31, 2002 with a closing date of January 1st, 2003.&#13;
The following graphs compare expected disbursements to standard disbursement profiles for the&#13;
transport sector in Niger. Disbursement under the projects are expected to be slower that based&#13;
on the standard profiles during the 1998-2000 period then catch up with the standard profiles in&#13;
2001. This is justified by the start of works on rural roads only in 2000 after the rural road&#13;
maintenance strategy has been established.&#13;

48.   To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, a&#13;
Special Account will be opened in CFAF in a commercial bank on terms and conditions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                    Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocation amounts to CFAF 400 million and covers about&#13;
four months of eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, an arnount of CFAF 200 million,&#13;
representing 50 percent of the authorized allocation will be deposited in the Special Account.&#13;
The remaining balance will be made available when the total amount withdrawn from the credit&#13;
account and/or special commitments issued amounts to SDR 8 million. The Special Account will&#13;
be used for all payments below 20 percent of the initial deposit. Replenishments will be&#13;
submitted monthly.&#13;
49.   Disbursements will be made against standard Bank documentation, except for contracts&#13;
of less than US$250,000 equivalent for civil works, US$70,000 for goods, US$100,000 for&#13;
consulting firns and US$50,000 for individual consultants, for which certified statements of&#13;
expenditure will be used. These statements of expenditure will be subject to review by&#13;
supervision missions and periodic financial audits.&#13;
50.   Operating costs consist of incremental expenditures related to the project and supported&#13;
by the Government to operate NBC. They include consumable, communications, contractual&#13;
salaries excluding civil servant salaries, field supervision and subsistence allowances, building&#13;
and office/vehicle/equipment operation and maintenance. NBC's annual budget is estimated at&#13;
US$50,000. Operating costs will be financed after 2001 only as they are financed for the first&#13;
years of project execution by the Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
G. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
51.   Accounting. NBC will maintain records and accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance&#13;
with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources and expenditures in respect of the IDA&#13;
credit. Accounting procedures will be defined in a manual prepared by NBC and to be agreed by&#13;
IDA before effectiveness. The project is assisting NBC with PPF funds to put in place a&#13;
computerized management information system to manage the project's financial accounts. The&#13;
system is expected to be implemented by December 1997. A new accountant should be&#13;
appointed before credit effectiveness.&#13;
52.   Auditing. The project auditors have already been appointed. During negotiations, the&#13;
Borrower agreed to:&#13;
(a)   have the records and accounts referred to in the preceding paragraph including&#13;
those for the Special Account and the Project Account audited semiannually, in&#13;
accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied, by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to IDA;&#13;
(b)   furnish to IDA as soon as available, but in any case not later than four months&#13;
after the end the period covered by each semiannual audit, a certified copy of the&#13;
report of such auxdit by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as IDA shall&#13;
have reasonably requested; and&#13;
(c)   furnish to IDA such other information concerning said records and accounts and&#13;
the audit thereof as IDA shall from time to time reasonably request.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                        19&#13;
53.   For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Credit Account were&#13;
made on the basis of statements of expenditure, the Borrower shall:&#13;
(a)   maintain or cause to be maintained, in accordance with paragraph 51 records and&#13;
accounts reflecting such expenditures;&#13;
(b)   retain, until at least one year after IDA has received the audit report for the period&#13;
covered by the audit in which the last withdrawal from the Credit Account or&#13;
payment out of the Special Account was made, all records (contracts, orders,&#13;
invoices, bills, receipts and other documents) evidencing such expenditures;&#13;
(c)   enable IDA's representatives to examine such records; and&#13;
(d)   ensure that such records and accounts are included in the annual audit referred to&#13;
in paragraph 52 and that the report of such audit contains a separate opinion by&#13;
said auditors as to whether the statements of expenditure submitted during such&#13;
fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their&#13;
preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals.&#13;
H. REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
54.   Reporting. NBC will prepare quarterly progress reports and in advance of each IDA&#13;
supervision mission. The format and the timing of the progress reports is included in the project&#13;
implementation plan drafted before appraisal. The Borrower should submit an Implementation&#13;
Completion Report to IDA no later than six months after the closing date of the credit.&#13;
55.   Monitoring. In addition to the financial audits of the project accounts, a technical audit of&#13;
the works financed under the project will be carried out semi-annually by independent external&#13;
auditors. During negotiations, the Government agreed to carry out this audit and furnish the audit&#13;
report to IDA not later than four months after the end of the period covered by the audit.&#13;
56.   Performance Indicators. Three types of indicators have been defined:&#13;
(a)   Key project performance indicators (see table 7) based on which IDA will decide&#13;
at the mid-term review whether to continue the project as appraised, restructure&#13;
one project's component or the entire project, or cancel one project's component&#13;
or the entire project. These indicators will reflect the degree with which the&#13;
project development objectives are achieved. The value/target of these indicators&#13;
were agreed during negotiations.&#13;
(b)   General project performance indicators will characterize progress in project&#13;
execution, project activities and outputs. A detailed list of indicators is provided&#13;
in Annex 7.&#13;
(c)   Sector performance indicators will characterize sector evolution during project&#13;
execution. A detailed list of indicators is provided in Annex 7.&#13;

57.    Supervision Plan. The project will be supervised three times a year by IDA missions.&#13;
Mission activities will consist of field visits to work sites, review of financial and management&#13;
practices, bidding and disbursement procedures, and performance indicators. Missions will also&#13;
monitor the implementation of environmental mitigation plans. The supervision schedule and&#13;
mission composition are presented in Annex 8.&#13;
58.    Mid-term Review. A mid-term review will be carried out no later than November 30,&#13;
1999. The review will give the opportunity to discuss transport issues with a large group of&#13;
sector stakeholders (shippers, private operators, administration, donors). The review will assess&#13;
the Government's continued commitment to the project's objectives. The review will take stock&#13;
of progress in the implementation of institutional reforms agreed by the Government in its Letter&#13;
of Sector Policy (Annex 2). Taking into account the numerous risks identified (para. 68), which&#13;
can prevent successful achievement of the project objectives, the mid-term review will give the&#13;
opportunity to decide on project continuation, restructuring or cancellation. The Government&#13;
agreed during negotiations to the carrying out of the mid-term review with the objectives&#13;
described above.&#13;
I. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
59.    The project is rated category A. During pre-appraisal, an overall environmental impact&#13;
assessment of the road regraveling works was carried out which concluded that most of the&#13;
works are unlikely to have any major adverse impact on the environment as: (a) they only&#13;
involve regraveling of existing roads; (b) no new construction and no new alignments are&#13;
intended; and (c) traffic patterns are not expected to change to any large extent and therefore no&#13;
significant increase of new developments with subsequent secondary environmental impacts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                    21&#13;
would be entailed. Site-specific environmental impact assessments will be carried out for each&#13;
road as part of the engineering studies and measures will be defined to mitigate negative&#13;
environmental impacts such as loss of vegetation cover, soil erosion, land degradation or sand&#13;
encroachment. Terms of reference for these environmental impact assessments are available in&#13;
the project files. With appropriate planning of the road works including mitigation measures for&#13;
water management, soil conservation and maintenance/replacement of vegetation cover, potential&#13;
negative environrmental effects should be avoided or kept at a minimum. The mitigation&#13;
measures should be incorporated in the works contracts and consulting firms responsible for the&#13;
supervision of works execution should ensure that the measures are actually implemented. The&#13;
assessment is summarized in Annex 9.&#13;
60.   Before appraisal, a full environmental impact assessment was carried out on two existing&#13;
roads (Gaya-Margou and Margou-Ounditan) which were initially included in the project and had&#13;
potential impact on natural habitats. The southern part of road Gaya-Margou is crossing the&#13;
Dosso Reserve, created as a buffer zone for the W National Park, which is located on the&#13;
opposite side of the Niger river. Park animals occasionally cross the river to feed in the reserve&#13;
when the water level is low. A number of protected trees are also found in the area. Large areas&#13;
being under cultivation or used for pasture, the project would not involve impact on original&#13;
natural habitats. The Margou-Ounditan road serves the Dallol Bosso area, home of the last&#13;
giraffes remaining in West Africa. The area is unprotected and has become a recognized tourist&#13;
attraction. Official guides have been trained, to draw upon wildlife tourism as a source of local&#13;
income, at the same time strengthening the awareness and protection of wildlife. Measures have&#13;
been identified to minimize any potential consequences of road works, but also to take the&#13;
opportunity to improve the environmental conditions and prepare for future traffic growth.&#13;
Although the Government eventually decided that the two roads will not be included in the&#13;
project, there is still the possibility that some roads included in the project may be funded by&#13;
other sources in the future and hence the roads Margou-Gaya and Margou-Ounditan be re-&#13;
introduced in the IDA project. To ensure that the road works will not be executed without the&#13;
measures to protect the environment, the Government has committed itself to implement the&#13;
environmental mitigation plan defined in the environmental assessment, should it request IDA to&#13;
finance the works on the roads during project execution. The environmental assessment is&#13;
summarized in Annex 10.&#13;
61.   Special attention should be given to soil erosion in connection with road works on&#13;
Madaoua-Keita and Keita-RN25 PK22. Detailed directives should be developed during the&#13;
environmental study of these roads carried out as part of the detailed engineering studies. The&#13;
road Foneko-Yatakala is located in an area with scattered settlements. The region is subject to a&#13;
larger environmental assessment triggered by requests from the mining industry to construct&#13;
access roads to potential mining sites in areas not yet opened to development. Although, the road&#13;
Foneko-Yatakala does not open any new area to settlements and development, it will be&#13;
important to follow the conclusions of the on-going environmental assessment.&#13;
62.   An overall environmental assessment of the rural road sector was carried out before&#13;
appraisal. The assessment identified roads where works would have a significant environmental&#13;
impact and which would need a full environmental impact assessment before the decision to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
:22                                   Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
carry out the road works is taken. A multi-criteria analysis was used to evaluate the&#13;
environmental risk related to hydrology, geomorphology, sand silting up, bushfires, use of local&#13;
materials and biodiversity. The Government has confirmed that roads included in the project will&#13;
be chosen among those not presenting a significant risk for the environment using the multi-&#13;
criteria analysis established in the overall environmental impact assessment. Technical studies&#13;
preliminary to the execution of the pilot operation will include site-specific environmental&#13;
assessments and preparation of mitigation plans which will be implemented under the project.&#13;
The assessment is summarized in Annex 11.&#13;
63.  In January 1997, the Government has adopted a law  which institutionalizes&#13;
environmental studies for economic development projects. The National Council of Environment&#13;
for a Sustainable Development (CNEDD) is the Coordinating body for environmental&#13;
management of economic development. With the creation of CNEDD, directives were given&#13;
requesting all governmental institutions to assign focal points for the environment. A unit&#13;
responsible for environmental management and impact assessment of road works in the Ministry&#13;
of Equipment and Infrastructure was created and its staff appointed in early 1997. The&#13;
Government is committed to maintain this unit during the project life. Summary terms of&#13;
reference for the staff are available in the project files. The Department of Environment in the&#13;
Ministry of Hydraulics and Environment will provide additional support to MEI. Resources and&#13;
training will be provided under the project to help in the startup of the environmental unit in&#13;
MEI. The proposed mid-term review will include a post-evaluation of the environmental impact&#13;
of the project and formulate recommendations if necessary for the second half of the project.&#13;
64.   Recommendations included in the environmental impact assessments of the regraveling&#13;
works, including the roads Gaya-Margou-Ounditan, and the rural road sector were summarized&#13;
in an environmental mitigation plan adopted by the Government on September 3, 1997. The draft&#13;
assessments were discussed with other departments in the administration and the major NGOs in&#13;
Niger involved in the environment sector. The list of activities, their timetable, the costs and&#13;
entities responsible for the implementation of the plan are summarized in Annex 12. The final&#13;
assessments and the mitigation plan will be made available to the public in Niger.&#13;
J. BENEFITS&#13;
65.   Benefits have been calculated for the regraveling of the 13 earth roads included in the&#13;
project (Table 8 below). They result from savings in vehicle operating costs and preservation of&#13;
road assets preventing further costly rehabilitation. The unit cost of works has been increased by&#13;
five percent to take into account measures to protect the environment. No benefits resulting from&#13;
these measures have been accounted for. Detailed assumptions, rates of return and net present&#13;
values are provided in Annex 13. The Net Present Value discounted at 12 percent of benefits for&#13;
the program of works included in the project amounts to CFAF 27.6 billion. ERRs for individual&#13;
roads range between 28 and more than 200 per cent. Sensitivity studies in annex 13 present the&#13;
impact of a shadow exchange rate based on a seven percent premium on foreign exchange and a&#13;
50 percent shadow price for salaries.&#13;

66.   Benefits from the basic scenario were compared to benefits resulting from other&#13;
alternatives which were eventually rejected:&#13;
(a)   Pavement of one among two earth roads with traffic above 150 vehicles per day,&#13;
has been considered but rejected. Given the fixed budget for the project, this&#13;
would have allowed to pave one road and regravel six earth roads for a total of&#13;
615 km against regraveling 13 roads for a total of 1,060 km in the basic scenario.&#13;
The net present value discounted at 12 percent of this alternative is CFAF 19.9&#13;
billion, much lower than in the basic scenario.&#13;
(b)   Postponement of works by two years has also been considered. The net present&#13;
value amounts to CFAF 23.2 billion.&#13;
(c)   Alternatives with a 10-cm and a 20-cm surface layer have been compared to the&#13;
15-cm basic scenario. The net present values are CFAF 28.2 billion and CFAF&#13;
27.8 billion.&#13;
67.   Other benefits have been identified but not measured:&#13;
(a)   Benefits expected from the institution building component for the public works&#13;
sector are: strengthening of the existing capacity in MEI to monitor road&#13;
conditions and program road maintenance works; improved use of local resources&#13;
for road maintenance; improved efficiency of road maintenance execution by&#13;
using local small and medium enterprises to replace force account; reduction of&#13;
adverse impact of road works on environment.&#13;

24                                     Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(b)   Benefits expected from the rural road component are: improved sustainability of&#13;
rural roads development programs; and reduced poverty in rural areas where the&#13;
pilot operation will be executed.&#13;
(c)   Benefits expected from the road transport component are: improved road safety&#13;
and better protection of road assets.&#13;
K. RISKS&#13;
68.   Several risks are presented hereafter. Some are related to measures with a strong political&#13;
impact, and thus difficult to mitigate. Although a solution would have been to postpone the&#13;
project until the most critical reforms are implemented, this report recommends to start the&#13;
project and assess the risk occurrence during the project's mid-term review. This is justified by&#13;
the good quality of the dialogue with the Government during project preparation and by the&#13;
opinion that starting the project would do more to help implement difficult measures than&#13;
postponing it. The following risks were identified:&#13;
(a)   The political risk is the most important risk. The new Government, which came&#13;
on power in 1996, is fully committed to the proposed reforms, but difficulties&#13;
encountered during the preparation of the project before 1996 demonstrate that&#13;
reforms may be strongly opposed if the commitment weakens due to political&#13;
changes. A new Government could delay State divestiture of operations in the&#13;
transport sector. It is difficult to identify measures which could mitigate this risk.&#13;
Therefore, should the risk occur, the mid-term review will give the opportunity for&#13;
any decision regarding project continuation, restructuring or cancellation.&#13;
(b)   As the project will support a significant restructuring of the transport and public&#13;
works sector, there is a risk of delays in the implementation of the reforms due to&#13;
Government's reluctance to proceed because of social impact, under the pressure&#13;
of staff to be laid off in the institutions which need to be restructured. A&#13;
sensitization campaign will be carried out to informn and explain the rationale for&#13;
the reforms. The campaign will include workshops, seminars, study trips abroad&#13;
financed with project funds. However, this is not expected to significantly&#13;
mitigate the risk. Again, the mid-term review will give the opportunity for any&#13;
decision regarding project continuation, restructuring or cancellation.&#13;
(c)   Lack of funds for severance payment of staff to be laid off is a serious risk taking&#13;
into account the scarcity of local resources. To mitigate this risk, particular&#13;
attention will be paid during project execution to the inscription of the required&#13;
resources in the annual budgets prepared in consultation with IDA. Resources&#13;
will be needed in 1998 for the severance payment of staff in the equipment pool.&#13;
They range between CFAF 435 million and CFAF 950 million depending on the&#13;
outcome of negotiations with the union. Currently, CFAF 800 million are&#13;
budgeted by the Government in 1997 and CFAF 1.2 billion in 1998 for&#13;
expenditures related to the civil servant voluntary departure program and the&#13;
financing of redundancies is sought from adjustment operations. Resources will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project                      25&#13;
be needed in 1999 and 2000 to accompany the transfer of road maintenance&#13;
execution from force account to contractors, but have still to be estimated based&#13;
on the study on the restructuring of the Department of Public Works to be carried&#13;
out under the project. In addition to the transport sector, ressources will be&#13;
required for the redundancies resulting from the ongoing program of privatization&#13;
which includes the water, electricity and telecommunications utilities. Provision&#13;
of resources to finance these redundancies is being discussed with donors&#13;
including IDA. Also included in the macro-economic dialogue is the amount of&#13;
severance payment paid per staff, which currently equals three years of salaries&#13;
but, if maintained as such, would largely exceed the resources available in the&#13;
budget or from donors. The mid-term review will assess the impact of the&#13;
occurrence of lack of funds for severance payment on the project.&#13;
(d)   Because of the passenger traffic allocation system, the risk is that savings on&#13;
vehicle operating costs resulting from improved conditions on roads regraveled&#13;
under the project are not passed on to passengers. The risk does not exist for&#13;
freight transport as the allocation system is not applied to domestic freight&#13;
transport on the roads included in the project and the project will not finance&#13;
strengthening of paved international itineraries which link Niger to Benin and&#13;
Togo and where the system is applied. For passenger traffic, the Government is&#13;
committed to discouraging this system and seek to replace the system by bus&#13;
schedules. Sensitization activities aimed at transport operators will mitigate the&#13;
risk that discussions between the Government and transport operators fail and that&#13;
the allocation system be maintained.&#13;
(e)   Lack of protection of road assets after their maintenance is a risk which would&#13;
hamper the sustainability of road works. Cooperation of the road industry is&#13;
essential to mitigate this risk. The project will support through seminars,&#13;
workshops and study trips abroad, the dialogue with the road transport industry to&#13;
improve compliance with the regulation on axle loads and rain barriers.&#13;
Involvement of road users in the Road Fund is also a measure expected to&#13;
sensitize road users to the need to protect road assets.&#13;
(f)   To mitigate the impact of lack of counterpart funds after the start of contracts, the&#13;
Government will be requested to deposit counterpart funds for any works contract&#13;
financed from the IDA credit under the road component on a project account in a&#13;
commercial bank prior to the signature of the contract. However, this does not&#13;
mitigate the risk of lack of counterpart funds before signature of the contracts&#13;
which would delay contracts' signature and project's execution. Attention will be&#13;
paid during project execution to the inscription of the required resources in the&#13;
annual budgets prepared in consultation with IDA. Counterpart funds&#13;
requirements will be included in the management of the State's cash-flow, which&#13;
was not the case in the past, and this is expected to mitigate the risk of their&#13;
unavailability. In addition, donors will pay a particular attention to the&#13;
improvement of the State's cash-flow  management as a macro-economic&#13;
&#13;

performance indicator. The mid-term review will assess the risk occurrence and&#13;
appropriate decisions will be taken in this respect at that time.&#13;
(g)   In the highway sector, the risk of lack of funds to finance recurrent costs will be&#13;
mitigated by improved planning and budgeting, and, starting with fiscal year&#13;
1999, the use of the Road Fund replenished with resources collected from road&#13;
users and managed with the participation of road users. A satisfactory macro-&#13;
economic framework will also alleviate this risk.&#13;
(h)   Lack of sustainability of capacity building activities may result of the mobility of&#13;
staff in the technical ministries. This will be mitigated by favoring mass training&#13;
rather than individual training.&#13;
(i)   Lack of consistency in the dialogue between IDA and the Government due to the&#13;
turnover of IDA's task managers resulting often in the new task managers&#13;
questioning the approach taken under the project is a risk emphasized by the&#13;
Government. This risk will be mitigated by involving more the Resident Mission&#13;
in the supervision of the project to ensure continuity on the IDA side. IDA's&#13;
management will also pay attention to ensure smooth transition between task&#13;
managers, comprising at least one week of work at headquarters and one&#13;
supervision mission in common.&#13;

I. REMINDER ON MACRO-ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES&#13;
During the last years, the economy of Niger has been characterized by a slowing down of&#13;
activities and the emergence of external and fiscal deficits, whose internal and exogenous&#13;
explanatory factors are bad climatic conditions, the conditions of a land-locked country, the price&#13;
fall of uranium, the deterioration of terms of exchange and deficiencies in socio-economic&#13;
management.&#13;
The bad performances generated by the weak competitiveness of the economy are&#13;
worsened by the net aggravation of mass poverty faced by a large portion of the population. The&#13;
numerous economic choices adopted by the authorities have not given the expected results.&#13;
After the interruption or the absence of programs with the institution of Bretton Woods during&#13;
the 1989-1993 period, the government has resumed its adjustment efforts since the second&#13;
semester of 1995.&#13;
From the results obtained in 1996, the Government has updated and strengthened its mid-&#13;
term strategy with the principal objective being an acceleration of the economic growth that will&#13;
allow it to sustainably reduce poverty. The objectives and measures associated to the&#13;
Government's strategy are described in the policy framework paper for the 1997-1999 period.&#13;
During this period, the Government intends to continue its efforts to stabilize the macro-&#13;
economy, while creating favorable conditions for a strong, balanced and sustainable growth.&#13;
The economy of Niger will have to be more involved in investment activities, production&#13;
and exportation in order to realize the economic growth desired or expected.&#13;
The Government will continue therefore to pursue rigorous monetary and budgetary&#13;
policies, to intensify structural reform, in particularly that of public enterprises and public&#13;
administration, to improve management of rural development and natural resources, while giving&#13;
a particular importance to policies leading to better education, health and infrastructure.&#13;
II. POLICIES&#13;
A.   ROAD MAINTENANCE POLICY&#13;
Since 1989, Niger's economic and financial situation has ceased to be favorable to the&#13;
maintenance of a satisfactory level of investment in road maintenance and construction. The&#13;
combination of the resulting maintenance backlog, the serious deterioration of the entire road&#13;
network and the urgent need to satisfy new access infrastructure requirements calls for new&#13;
attitudes and rigorous utilization of the available resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                    Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;

B.    TRANSPORTATION&#13;
B.1   LIand and Sea Transport&#13;
The trucking industry comprises a modem sector with a few companies, such as the Niger&#13;
National Road Transport Company (Societe Nationale des Transports Nigeriens--SNTN), and an&#13;
informal sector consisting of private operators grouped within a road transport union.&#13;
The economic crisis that has prevailed in Niger for the last few years has generated a&#13;
number of structural and organizational problems. These include, in particular:&#13;
*  low road transport profitability;&#13;
*  surplus capacity;&#13;
o  an aged and decrepit vehicle fleet;&#13;
*  inadequate extension and operator training agencies;&#13;
*  poorly qualified transport operators;&#13;
*  high transportation costs.&#13;
B.1.1 Objectives and goals&#13;
Pursuit of transport system efficiency necessarily calls for defining orientations and&#13;
specific objectives. These may be summarized as follows:.&#13;
*  improving access to and within Niger;&#13;
e  reducing transportation costs;&#13;
*  improving service quality;&#13;
*  strengthening road safety.&#13;
B.1.2 Strategies&#13;
The above objectives will be pursued through the following strategies:&#13;
*  diversification of maritime access routes;&#13;
*  improvement of the free circulation of persons and goods;&#13;
*  phased liberalization of the sector;&#13;
*  better matching of supply and demand;&#13;
*  logistical improvements;&#13;
*  renewal of the vehicle fleet;&#13;
*  upgrading of operators' professional skills;&#13;
*  strengthening institutional capacities;&#13;
*  revitalizing the agencies with road safety responsibilities;&#13;
*  strengthening vehicle technical inspection.&#13;
B.1.3 Plan of activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2                                                                         37&#13;
B. 1.3.1 Activities already implemented. A number of measures have already been taken under&#13;
the strategy support plan. They include:&#13;
* liberalization of transport tariffs (Decree no. 94/PRN/MCT of June 22, 1994);&#13;
* ending of SNTN's monopoly on the transport of the freight of mining companies (Order no.&#13;
037 MACA/T/DTT of June 28, 1996);&#13;
* the SNTN restructuring plan, comprising:&#13;
(a)   transfer of passenger transport activities to focus SNTN's activities on transport of&#13;
general freight and petroleum products:&#13;
a.    creation of a private interurban passenger transport company in November&#13;
1994;&#13;
b.    creation of a mixed-capital company in December 1996;&#13;
(b)   downsizing of SNTN by reducing the number of staff: 20 staff have benefited of&#13;
advanced packages for retirement;&#13;
(c)   organization of personnel information and awareness-raising activities related to the&#13;
company restructuring plan.&#13;
B. 1.3.2Activities to be carried out Supplementing the activities already carried out, the&#13;
following measures will be taken in the short and medium term:&#13;
* to fmalize the SNTN restructuring plan, as follows:&#13;
(a)   the interurban and urban transportation companies will be operational by end. of 1997;&#13;
(b)   146 staff will leave SNTN by the end of the first quarter of 1998;&#13;
-     discourage the traffic allocation system by:&#13;
(a)   organizing awareness-raising and information activities for transport operators and&#13;
users: a workshop will be organized for this purpose by December 1997;&#13;
(b)   setting up regular transportation services provided on pre-established terms: in the&#13;
case of interurban transport, Order no. 031 of May 24, 1983 (concerning transport&#13;
license validity zones) will be strictly applied before the end of March 1998;&#13;
(c)   putting relations between transport operators and shippers on a contractual basis&#13;
(institution of transport contracts) in 1998: to that end the Government will encourage&#13;
the formation of transport cooperatives or companies;&#13;
* eliminate excess road controls pursuant to Circular no. l0/MI/AT/MDN of November 7,&#13;
1996 concerning transport vehicle inspection procedures;&#13;
* the following activities will take place concerning accident prevention and road safety:&#13;
(a)   revitalize the training agencies such as the Road Transport Techniques Training&#13;
Center (Centre de Formation aux Techniques de Transports Routiers--CFTTR);&#13;
(b)   provide basic and further training in road safety management for the sector's&#13;
supervisory institutions;&#13;
(c)   organize the collection and analysis of accident data;&#13;
(d)   conduct road user awareness-raising and information activities;&#13;
(e)   take steps to strengthen vehicle inspection;&#13;
* to manage the development of the vehicule fleet, the vehicle certification computerized&#13;
system will be extended outside of Niamey;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                               0   Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
abolish OCBN's monopoly: the Government of Niger reaffirms its determination to abolish&#13;
OCBN's freight transport monopoly, in consultation with the Beninese party; The&#13;
Government also reaffirms its determination to progressively privatize the management of&#13;
OCBN in the context of the negotiations with its partners (the Beninese authorities, World&#13;
Bank, Caisse Francaise de Developpement). A consultation among all parties involved is&#13;
envisaged in 1998.&#13;
o the Government reaffirms its determination to restructure the maritime transport sector to&#13;
adapt it to ongoing changes; recommendations issued by the Ministerial Conference of&#13;
Western and Central Africa on Maritime Transport held in Cotonou in June 1997 will be&#13;
implemented; the sector and auxiliary services will be liberalized within a five-year period&#13;
and the activities of the National Shippers Council (CNUT) will be reviewed&#13;
accordingly.CNUT will stop distributing maritime cargo traffic by June 1998; shippers will&#13;
be free to chose their shipping line; a reflection will be launched on the management of&#13;
traffic rights; CNUT will be involved in other activities; in this regard, construction of an&#13;
hinterland port will be envisaged and a national transport observatory will be created in 1998;&#13;
* river infrastructure will be built to facilitate loading and unloading of pirogues.&#13;
B.2   Air Transport&#13;
This subsector, in which Niger places great hope, has for some time been beset by&#13;
difficulties which hamper its operation.&#13;
B.2.1 Objectives and goals&#13;
The main objective is to improve airport management.&#13;
B.2.2 Strategy&#13;
The strategy is to transfer the management of national civil aviation operations to the Air&#13;
Navigation Safety Agency for Africa and Madagascar (Agence pour la Securite de la Navigation&#13;
Aerienne en Afrique et a Madagascar--ASECNA). Negotiations to that end have already begun.&#13;
B. 2.3 Plan of activities&#13;
This comprises:&#13;
* transfer of the management of national civil aviation operations to ASECNA;&#13;
* reduce the price of aviation fuel in order to make Niger's airport platforms competitive;&#13;
* stabilize aviation fees at the 1995 rate for the years 1996 and 1997.&#13;

Annex 9: Summary of Environmental Assessment of the Road Sector and Earth&#13;
Regraveling Works financed under the Project&#13;
1.    The methodology utilized to conduct the environmental assessment was based on the&#13;
World Bank Operational Directives 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" and the related&#13;
Operational policy 4.04, "Natural Habitats"; and on the legislation drafted by Niger to&#13;
institutionalize environmental studies. The environmental assessment was carried out for 20&#13;
roads totaling 1751.5km, which at the time of the assessment, had the potential to be proposed to.&#13;
IDA financing. 13 roads totaling 1,060km have been eventually retained for IDA financing (see&#13;
list in table 7 of Chapter I-Benefits in the main text of the SAR).&#13;
2.    Environmental Impact. In general, the adverse environmental impact of the works on&#13;
most of the proposed roads is expected to be limited for the following reasons:&#13;
(a)   The works only involve regraveling the lateritic road surface keeping the existing&#13;
roadbase.&#13;
(b)   No new alignment will be included.&#13;
(c)   The improvement of the road conditions is not expected to change the traffic&#13;
patterns to any large extent and would therefore not entail significant increase of&#13;
new developments with subsequent secondary environmental impacts.&#13;
3.    Among the 20 roads, four will merit special considerations:&#13;
(a)   Road Margou-Gaya: The southern part of the road is passing through the Partial&#13;
Reserve of Dosso. This reserve was created as a buffer for the W National park,&#13;
which is located on the opposite side of the river Niger. During a few months of&#13;
the year, when the water level of the river is low, park animals occasionally cross&#13;
over to feed in the reserve. A number of protected trees are also found in the area.&#13;
(b)   Road Margou-Ounditan: The road serves the Dallol Bosso area, which is home of&#13;
the last giraffes remaining in West Africa and is of considerable interest to&#13;
biodiversity conservation. It is presently unprotected. Most of the area is&#13;
cultivated or used as pastoral land. The giraffes are co-existing with the local&#13;
population and domestic animals. The giraffes are a recognized tourism attraction.&#13;
Thus, local traffic is expected to grow.&#13;
(c)   Road Madaoua-Keita-RN25 PK22: The topography of the Keita region is&#13;
characterized by hilly terrain with steep slopes. Thus the risk of erosion is&#13;
particularly high in connection with the road works.&#13;
(d)   Road Fonelo-Yatakala: The road is located in a region which contains areas with&#13;
only scattered settlements not yet opened to development. The whole region is&#13;
subject to a larger environmental impact assessment triggered by a request from&#13;
the mining industry to the Government and European Union for the construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9                                                                       61&#13;
of access roads to future potential mining sites. However, the road itself does not&#13;
open up any new areas to settlements and development.&#13;
4.    Social Impact. Current road conditions have not caused any limitation in the&#13;
transportation of goods and people. Regraveling of the surface is therefore not expected to&#13;
influence traffic intensity and encourage a significant increase in new developments. Improved&#13;
roads may invite increased speed of vehicles and thereby increase safety threat to pedestrians or&#13;
non-motorized vehicles.&#13;
5.    Mitigation Measures.&#13;
(a)   Guidelines on environmental aspects of road maintenance: It is recommended that&#13;
environmental guidance provided in the report "Road Maintenance and the&#13;
Environment" prepared under the Sub-saharan Africa Transport Program, a World&#13;
Bank/Economic Commission for Africa initiative, be adopted as a framework for&#13;
integrated management of road maintenance in Niger and serve as a practical&#13;
guide to the technical studies in the planning of the regraveling of each road&#13;
proposed under the project.&#13;
(b)   Site-specific environmental studies: For each individual road, a detailed site-&#13;
specific environmental study should be carried out at the planning stage and a set&#13;
of mitigation measures should be incorporated into the construction work plan.&#13;
The terns of reference of these studies are available in the project files.&#13;
(c)   Roads with special considerations:&#13;
(i)   Roads Margou-Gaya and Margou-Ounditan: A separate environmental&#13;
analysis should be carried out prior to the technical studies of project&#13;
execution. The analysis should pay particular attention to the biodiversity&#13;
values of the Dosso partial reserve and giraffe biotops along the two roads.&#13;
It should identify potential harmful effects on the natural fauna and flora.&#13;
It should also seek to identify opportunities for the project to contribute to&#13;
improving the current environmental conditions. Local people should be&#13;
consulted in order to ensure sustainable results.&#13;
(ii)   Road Madaoua-Keita-RN25 PK22: The site-specific environmental study&#13;
should pay particular attention to the high risk of erosion, recommend&#13;
measures to minimize adverse environmental impact, and to the benefit of&#13;
both the road and the surrounding environment, restore currently degraded&#13;
areas influenced by the road.&#13;
(iii)  Road Fonelo-Yatakala: The site-specific environmental study should&#13;
analyze and take into account any recommendations which concern the&#13;
area influenced by the road, resulting of the environmental impact&#13;
assessment of proposed mining access roads in the region, being carried&#13;
out with European Union financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62                                    Niger - Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(d)   Participation by local people: Local people should be given the opportunity to&#13;
participate and influence decision-making, for example, to help finding the most&#13;
appropriate solutions for managing run off water near the settlements.&#13;
5.    Environmental Management and Training. It is recommended that an environmental&#13;
unit be established within the Department of Highway in the Ministry of equipment and&#13;
Infrastructure. The unit would be responsible for environmental management and impact&#13;
assessment of road sector activities. The unit should initially consist of two specialists in the&#13;
following fields: ecology and natural resource management; and hydro-geology, soil sciences&#13;
and road engineering. Terms of reference of the unit are available in the project files. The budget&#13;
for the establishment of the unit, including operating costs, equipment, training and technical&#13;
assistance, estimated at CFAF59 million was included in the project costs. Additional training in&#13;
environment in the road sector will be provided to the other local concerned institutions. Training&#13;
costs were included in the project cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10                                                                 63&#13;
Annex 10: Environmental Assessment of the Regraveling of the road Gaya-&#13;
Margou-Ounditan&#13;
1.    Project Background. The road consists of two sections: Gaya-Margou (190.5km)&#13;
built in 1982-1984 and Margou-Ounditan (99km) built in 1982-1983. The road is&#13;
currently in poor condition with numerous potholes and a less-than-5cm surface layer.&#13;
The average annual daily traffic is around 55 vehicles per day on both sections. Proposed&#13;
works consist in the regraveling of the road (increase of the surface layer thickness to 15&#13;
cm), local rehabilitation of the base course, cleaning of culverts and ditches and signaling.&#13;
No new alignment is expected unless local and minor to improve drainage.&#13;
2.    Environmental Conditions. The zone of influence of the road includes several&#13;
environmentally sensitive areas:&#13;
(a)   The Dollol Bosso area which is home of the last giraffes remaining in&#13;
West Africa. The area is unprotected. Most of the area is cultivated or used&#13;
as pastoral land. The giraffes are co-existing with the local population and&#13;
domestic animals. The giraffes are a recognized tourist attraction. The&#13;
Government has trained about twenty official guides from the nearby&#13;
villages in an effort to draw upon wildlife tourism as a source of local&#13;
income, at the same time strengthening the awareness and protection of&#13;
wildlife. The Fakara-Boboye protected forest, which is of interest to&#13;
biodiversity conservation, is also located in the area.&#13;
(b)   With the Fakara-Boboye forest, the classified forests of Gorou-Bassounga&#13;
and Koulou are the last remaining homes for wildlife in the zone of&#13;
influence of the roads.&#13;
(c)   Along the Niger river, several ponds and water holes are used by wildlife.&#13;
Swamps and flooded areas are also home of several wildlife species.&#13;
(d)   Demographic pressure is important with about 20 villages or settlements&#13;
located along the road. Conflicts for land use have broken out almost&#13;
every year between farmers and livestock breeders.&#13;
3.    Environmental Impacts. Positive and negative impacts have been identified:&#13;
(a)   Positive impacts: There is a strong potential for development of&#13;
ecotourism mostly to visit the giraffes but also areas along the Niger river.&#13;
Export of agricultural products will be facilitated. This would result in job&#13;
creation and increase of revenues for the local population. The project also&#13;
gives the opportunity to improve environmental conditions of wildlife&#13;
(protection of giraffes against road accidents, creation of new water holes).&#13;
(b)   Negative impacts: The most specific negative impacts are: (i) In the short&#13;
term, the activities around work facilities and the roadworks can disturb&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64                                       Niger - Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project&#13;
the life conditions of the giraffes making them move temporarily to new&#13;
areas. Use of some quarries would have a similar impact on the wildlife in&#13;
other areas along the road. Poaching is a risk. Borrowing of materials in&#13;
the river near the Ouna village would be a threat for houses and fruit trees&#13;
located near the river. (ii) In the longer term, the use of seven quarries may&#13;
accelerate sand encroachement of the Dallol Bosso river. Better transport&#13;
conditions will make firewood and doum palmtree more competitive and&#13;
may cause their overexploitation. Accelerate increase of population along&#13;
the road may result in increased hunting and create a threat for the local&#13;
wildlife, in increased consumption of firewood and cause deforestation, in&#13;
increased demographic pressure and more conflicts between farmers and&#13;
livestock breeders.&#13;
4.    Mitigation Measures. The following measures have been defined:&#13;
(a)   Work facilities will be located at more than 3km from villages and 5 km&#13;
from protected and classified forests along the road.&#13;
(b)   Protected trees and the bigger trees will be tagged. Should they need to be&#13;
cut, an authorization will be sought from the Department of Environment&#13;
in the Ministry of Environment.&#13;
(c)   Unless authorized by the Department of Environment on the basis of&#13;
conditions specific to each forest, borrowing of materials will be forbidden&#13;
in the three forests along the road. The quarry located near the Kodo forest&#13;
used by the giraffes during the rain season will be closed during this&#13;
season.&#13;
(d)   Signaling will urge road users to reduce speed and exert caution in areas&#13;
inhabited by the giraffes. Other actions to rehabilitate the habitat of the&#13;
giraffes will be coordinated with an ongoing project aimed at the local&#13;
population to prevent deforestation and clearing of land.&#13;
(e)   Several measures to protect the road against erosion have been identified&#13;
at specific locations (plantation of trees, rock fills).&#13;
(f)   Measures have been defined to restore quarries after works are completed.&#13;
(g)   The populations along the road will be sensitized to increase awareness on&#13;
environmental issues and environmental protection. A framework&#13;
involving the populations, the Public Works Department, the Department&#13;
of environment and other partners was established to monitor the&#13;
implementation of the measures during the execution of the works as well&#13;
as to follow up on the environmental impact of the works after their&#13;
completion.&#13;

Annex 11 : Environmental Assessment of Road Works on the Rural Road Network&#13;
1.    Project Background. The rural road network totals 1,246 km, about 9 percent of the&#13;
entire road network. To open access to several landlocked areas in the country, the Government&#13;
has identified about 2,200 km of new rural roads. A map with an indicative laying out of the new&#13;
rural roads is available in the project files. The geographical distribution of existing and&#13;
projected rural roads is presented in the following table. The Government has requested to&#13;
include in the project proposed to IDA the financing of a pilot operation to establish a new&#13;
strategy aiming at sustaining rural road maintenance.&#13;

Total               1,246         2,214&#13;
2.    Environmental Conditions. An environmental assessment was carried out to identify&#13;
environmental issues which might result from the construction of new roads, to provide criteria&#13;
to prioritize these issues and help in the choice of roads to be included in the project, and to&#13;
prepare a mitigation plan to take into account environmental concerns in the preparation and&#13;
implementation of the works to be executed. Maps have been prepared to measure the primary&#13;
ecological potentiality in the zone of influence of each rural road. Field trips covenng seen road&#13;
sectors out of ten have been carried out to provide the field experience necessary to complement&#13;
the analytical works on the maps.&#13;
3.    Environmental Risks. A multi-criteria analysis has been used to evaluate the&#13;
environmental risks for each of the 39 roads among which the roads would be chosen for the&#13;
pilot operation. Eight most important risks have been identified: erosion by water; impacts&#13;
resulting of the construction due to the geomorphology along the road; sand encroachment; use&#13;
of local materials; bushfire; impact on the biodiversity; deforestation; and land use. The&#13;
following table provides the rating measuring the environmental risk, rating 1 being the lowest&#13;
risk, rating 3 being the highest. The result of the analysis classifies 16 roads (578 km) with a low&#13;
environmental risk; 15 roads (1,190 kmi) with a medium environmental risk; and 9 roads (350&#13;
kin) with a high environmental risk.&#13;

Annex 13: Economic Analysis&#13;
1.    The economic analysis was carried out using the HDM Model set up by the World Bank.&#13;
For each year of the economic analysis period, the model calculates the road deterioration due to&#13;
the traffic and the maintenance strategy applied to the road, the cost of the maintenance, and the&#13;
vehicle operating costs based on the new road condition. The model compares the total costs,&#13;
including rehabilitation costs, maintenance costs and vehicle operating costs, in the with- and&#13;
without-project scenarios. The maintenance strategies applied in the without- and with-project&#13;
scenarios and unit maintenance costs are presented in table 1. Table 2 presents key parameters of&#13;
the economic analysis and provides the Economic Rate of Return and the Net Present Value for&#13;
each road in the program. Table 3 presents the results of the economic analysis of technical&#13;
alternatives for roads included in the program proposed to IDA financing.&#13;

4.      Table 6 presents sensitivity studies. The first study adds the cost of enviromnental measures&#13;
to the base case estimated at about 5 percent of the cost of works. The second study is based on a&#13;
shadow exchange rate (SER) assuming a premium on foreign exchange of about seven percent.&#13;
Details for the calculation of the SER during the 1998-200 period are given in table 4. The&#13;
premium on foreign exchange is assumed to remain equal to 7 percent afterwards. The third study&#13;
is based on shadow pricing of salaries assuming a 50 percent reduction of the amount of salaries in&#13;
the costs of works, maintenance and vehicle operation. The percentage of salaries in the cost of&#13;
works is indicated in table 5. It is the same in the cost of road maintenance and is considered&#13;
negligible in vehicle operating costs. The fourth study applies both shadow  exchange rate and&#13;
shadow price on salaries. Studies number 2, 3 and 4 include the cost of environmental measures.&#13;
