&amp;#12;&#13;
A.       BACKGROUNDAND RECENTDEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Country and Sector Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       Since December 2001 and the inauguration o f the Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA)&#13;
Afghanistan's economic, social and political achievements have been extraordinary. The AH, and the&#13;
subsequent Transitional Islamic State o f Afghanistan (TISA) were confronted with an economy reeling&#13;
from protracted conflict and drought, more than five million people displaced as refugees inneighboring&#13;
countries, economic activities steered in an informal or illicit direction by insecurity, and a state that had&#13;
become virtually non functional interms o fpolicy making and service delivery - although the structures&#13;
and many staffremained. The achievements -various reforms inthe government, a successful&#13;
constitutional Loya Jirga, peaceful completion o f the country's first ever presidential election, and the&#13;
inauguration o f the new Cabinet inDecember 2004, just to name a few -have been significant, and in&#13;
Afghanistan's context, remarkable.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The achievements notwithstanding, the challenges remain enormous, including the restoration o f&#13;
countrywide security, rehabilitationo f key economic and social infrastructure, and the establishment o f&#13;
functional state institutions across the country. One o f the major bottlenecks that has affected and&#13;
continues to affect the pace and scope o f reconstruction i s a massive skill deficit that cuts across all&#13;
institutions in Afghanistan, from public administrators to teachers, from managers to skilled labor force&#13;
needed for the bulk o f the reconstruction work and its maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Over the past three years, the government o f Afghanistan has made notable efforts to revive the&#13;
higher education sector inparallelwith ongoingprogress inprimary and secondary education. Eighteen&#13;
higher education institutionshave reopened their doors and enrollment hasjumped from 4,000 students in&#13;
2001 to 37,000 inthe fall of 2004. As inprimary education, the enrollment profile is skewed with&#13;
approximately two-thirds o f students intheir first and second years. With students retuming from&#13;
Pakistan and other countries and the students graduating from high schools, demand for higher education&#13;
will also be on the rise, not only interms o f enrollment but also interms o frelevance o f curricula and&#13;
quality o f teaching.&#13;
&#13;
4.       There i s an urgent need for well-educated and trained leadership inall sectors o f the economy.&#13;
Rebuildinghigher education is a pressingand critical need for Afghanistan. First,there is a critical&#13;
shortage o fprofessionals such as engineers, technicians, administrators, accountants, agriculturists, and&#13;
business leaders, to meet the needs o f reconstruction, growth and poverty reduction. It i s an essential and&#13;
immediate need for the country to beginto develop these human resources. Second, higher education&#13;
constitutes the apex o f the education system, and sets the quality standards for the rest o f education. It i s&#13;
university professors who provide the key content for many textbooks and readingmaterials. It i s&#13;
university graduates who teach in senior secondary schools, which inturnproduce primary school&#13;
teachers. It i s essential to build a tradition of academic quality at this level inorder to rebuild the quality&#13;
tradition for the rest of the education sector. Third, because institutions take a long time to build, the&#13;
development process needs to start at the outset, in order to cope with the rising demand for the future.&#13;
&#13;
5,       Independentfrom immediatereconstruction needs, Afghan universities suffer from a large&#13;
majority of the problems that typically plague public tertiary institutions inmany developing countries:&#13;
low quality, lack o frelevance, insufficient funding, and weak governance and management. While these&#13;
problems have certainly been exacerbated by war and its negative economic consequences, they reflect&#13;
deep structural dysfunctions that require careful attention. Key issues facing the higher education are&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.       Poor aualitv ofeducation. The low quality o f higher education i s the result o f a number of&#13;
factors. There is an acute shortage o f qualified faculty members as many left the country duringthe&#13;
conflict years. Those who stayed have been isolated fi-om the outside world and are out o f touch with&#13;
major developments inteaching and research. Many faculty lack sufficient credentials and expertise for&#13;
their critical role inacademia. More than half(57%) o f the professors inthe 18 tertiary education&#13;
institutions inAfghanistan have only Bachelor's degrees, 38% have Masters, and only 5% have PhDs.&#13;
Curricula, teaching materials and pedagogical methods are grossly outmoded, with a particular lack o f up-&#13;
to-date textbooks and a heavy reliance on dictation as the principal way o f imparting knowledge to&#13;
students.&#13;

&#13;
7.       Fragmented and inefficient institutions. Given the size o f the country and its economy, there&#13;
are far too many higher education institutions inAfghanistan. Not surprisingly, many o f them would not&#13;
qualify as tertiary level institutions under any international standard or norm. The average enrollment i s&#13;
1,983 students per institution. As shown inthe above table, three institutions have less than 200 students;&#13;
Paktya University has only 50 students, Kunduz Pedagogic Institute 70 students, and Bamyan University&#13;
144. Some institutions appear extremely inefficient; the student to professor ratio is 4 to 1inKunduz&#13;
Pedagogic Institute, and 6 to 1inBamyan and PaktyaUniversities. The limitedresources allocated for&#13;
higher education are spread out thinly. In2003, the Ministryo fHigher Education (MOHE)mergedthe&#13;
universityand the pedagogic instituteinfour provinces. Thiskindo f consolidationfacilitates the&#13;
possibility o f institutions attaininga size that i s economically viable and thus leads to a better chance o f&#13;
reachingreasonable quality standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8.       Lack of avvrovriate vhvsical facilities. Inall cases, the physical infrastructure i s grossly&#13;
inadequate for what i s required for a university. Electricity and water supply are often insufficient andor&#13;
not functioning. Classroom, laboratory and library facilities are very rudimentary. Basic computer&#13;
facilities are lacking for both instruction and administration. Ongoing repair andrehabilitation activities&#13;
are ad-hoc, and facility planningbased on a strategic plan for the university i s non-existent. Kabul&#13;
University, for example, has a generous campus area, but there was no facility planning untilthis year.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Lack of relevance and linkages with the economv. Higher education institutionsinAfghanistan&#13;
do not have a tradition o f linkages with the productive sectors. Faculties and departments work in&#13;
isolation from employers. Neither the universities nor the polytechnicshave a Board o f Trustees with&#13;
representatives from the world o f work and civil society. Creating such linkages and conductingtracer&#13;
studies on aregular basis will be an important aspect o f improving the relevance o fhigher education&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
 10.     Inefficient and insufficient financing. The budget o f higher education institutions is barely&#13;
sufficient to cover salaries, free dormitory costs and highly subsidized meals for the students. Resources&#13;
are not available for the purchase o f indispensable pedagogical inputssuch as intemet access, textbooks,&#13;
journals and lab materials. Budgets are allocated purely on the basis o f historic trends without any&#13;
objective criteria, thereby offering no incentives for efficiency and innovation. Available resources such&#13;
as classroom space are not used efficiently; most university classes finish at lpm. Inaddition, the public&#13;
universities are unable to charge tuition fees as the new Constitution guarantees free education up to the&#13;
undergraduate level.&#13;
&#13;
 11.     Outdatedeovernance and manaeement. The governance and management structure and norms&#13;
are outdated. Most higher education institutions have little autonomy, ifany, and are subject to rigid&#13;
administrative regulations and rules. The notion o fplanning, management and performance indicators i s&#13;
both foreign and weak inthe higher education systemand ineach institution. Furthermore, both teaching&#13;
and administrative staff are civil servants and their pay scale i s confoundedwith civil service grades and&#13;
academic ranks.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     While the reconstruction needs are as overwhelming inthe higher education sector as inother&#13;
sectors, the present situation also offers a unique opportunity to undertake courageous reforms that may&#13;
not be possible inother countries where the key actors inthe higher education community have&#13;
entrenchedpositions that make change difficult ifnot impossible. The former Minister's attempt during&#13;
the constitutional Loya Jirga to introduce a clause inthe new Constitution that would have allowed for&#13;
tuition fees inpublic universities was not successful. But there are other critical reforms that could be&#13;
implementedinthenear future, such as rationalizingthe employment status and salary scale o ffaculty (to&#13;
attract better qualified faculty), establishing a quality assurance mechanism and rationalizing the budget&#13;
allocationprocess.&#13;
&#13;
Government Strategy&#13;
&#13;
13.      The government has drafted anew higher education law. The draft law stipulates the&#13;
responsibilities o f the state, public providers and private providers, with an emphasis on increased&#13;
institutional autonomy and accountability of higher education institutions. It classifies different types o f&#13;
higher education institutions, andprovides a framework for their organizational structures. Furthermore,&#13;
for the first time ever, the government i s allowing private institutions to operate inAfghanistan.'&#13;
&#13;
' Two  concrete initiatives are already ina relatively advanced planning stage inthis respect, one being the&#13;
establishment o f the American University o f Kabul designed after the model o f AU inBeirut and Cairo, and the&#13;
other being a branch campus of the Gulf Medical College.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14.      Inrecognition ofthe enormouschallenges and opportunities facingAfghanistan, especially inthe&#13;
higher education sector, the government o f Afghanistan envisions developing a post-secondary education&#13;
that is inclusive, equitable and accessible to all meritorious Afghans regardless o f gender, ethnicity,&#13;
religion, or geography. It aims to establish a system which i s rooted inand relevant to the country's&#13;
history, traditions, socioeconomic and culturalreality, its strategic location, its geopolitics and the&#13;
numerous challenges it faces. It aims to educate and train the national leadership and professionals in&#13;
various fields required for the reconstruction o f the country. The Ministryo f Higher Education (MOHE)&#13;
envisions a system that i s well-integrated with the international academic and intellectual community.&#13;
&#13;
15.      The government plans to improve the quality o f education inthe existing institutions; the initial&#13;
focus will be on four regional universities (Balkh, Herat, Kandahar and Nangarhar) as well as universities&#13;
inKabul. To fillthe knowledgeandpedagogical skillgaps ofthe teaching staff, the government and&#13;
universities are planning to "import" faculty from foreign education institutions while training younger&#13;
Afghan faculty through fellowships and distance learning. The reformand development taking place in&#13;
universities inKabul and four regional universities are expected to have a spill-over effect to other&#13;
smaller institutions inthe country.&#13;
&#13;
B.       BANK'S RESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
Transitional Support Strategy Framework&#13;
&#13;
16.      The reconstructionstrategy developedby the government of Afghanistan forms the framework&#13;
withinwhich the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) has beenprepared. Developedin&#13;
consultation with the government and other stakeholders, the TSS puts forward priorities for the Bank's&#13;
financial and non-financial assistance based on the areas o f comparative advantage o f the Bank. The TSS&#13;
focuses on four strategic areas; (a) improving livelihoods; (b) fiscal strategy, institutions and&#13;
management; (c) governance and public administrationreform; and (d) enabling private sector&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
17.      The proposedprogramboth directly and indirectly addresses all four objectives o fthe TSS&#13;
though human resource development at the tertiary education level. Good govemance, institutions that&#13;
are accountable, and a thriving private sector cannot be built without Afghan graduates with good&#13;
management and leadership skills together with respective disciplinary training. To achieve these&#13;
objectives, strengthening higher education institutions i s critical.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale for the Bank's Involvement&#13;
&#13;
18.      While development partners are inagreement on the critical needto review and develop the&#13;
higher education system, the financial and technical support extended so far has been very limited. A&#13;
summary o f the development partners' assistance to higher education i s shown inthe following table:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
19.     The government has requestedthe Bankto play a leadrole inhelpingthe government design a&#13;
long-term higher education development program which can mobilize various foundations, private sector&#13;
contributions, and foster linkages with high-quality universities abroad. The Bank can make significant&#13;
contributionsin at least two areas. First,the Bank i s ina unique position to introduce a comparative&#13;
global perspective on recent tertiary education developments and reform and adapt to specific national&#13;
context and needs. Second, extensive technical expertise and practical experience with tertiary education&#13;
projects over the past 20 years has given the Bank relevant and concrete implementation lessons that can&#13;
be used inamelioratingthe issues faced by higher education inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons fromthe first EmergencyEducationRehabilitationandDevelopmentProject&#13;
&#13;
20.     The Emergency Education Rehabilitation and DevelopmentProject (2002-2005) supported block&#13;
grants to universities inKabul, and block plus capitation grants to higher education institutions inthe&#13;
provinces. Block grants proved to be useful support for universities at the start o f the reconstruction&#13;
period as they provided flexible cash resources ina timely fashion (support from other donors inhigher&#13;
education was mainly inkind). However, the effectiveness o fblock grants would have been greater had&#13;
the grants been coupledwith technical assistance. Some o fthe decisions made at the university level with&#13;
regardto the use o f block grants were ad hoc and didnot always address institutional priorities. In some&#13;
cases, the unnecessary interventions by the Ministryinthe administration(e.g. procurement) o f block&#13;
grants by the universities delayed implementation. The proposed operation would provide focused&#13;
technical assistance to facilitate the strategic planning process at the universities, and partnership&#13;
arrangement to facilitate the preparation o f block grant proposals. The development o f the strategic plan&#13;
will intum aid the universities inprioritizing the needs o f the institution and its faculty which will form&#13;
the substance o f the block grant proposals. It i s important that the responsibility and oversight relations&#13;
betweenthe MOHE and universities are clarified and demarcated at the outset o fthe proposed programin&#13;
order to avoid implementationbottlenecks.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons fromthe Bank'sExperiencein TertiaryEducation&#13;
&#13;
21.     The Bank has been supportingtertiary education indeveloping countries since 1963. An intemal&#13;
review o f the implementation experience with tertiary education projects carried out in 19922highlights&#13;
three important elements inhigher education reform. First,there i s a need for comprehensive intervention&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
strategies and sustained long-term engagements inthe reformeffort. Second, attention to the political&#13;
economy of reform i s essential: technocratic andrational solutions will not solve the problem and&#13;
buildingpolitical consensus is critical. Third, the extent to which projectsrely on positive incentives&#13;
rather than mandatory edicts to stimulate change has a greater influence on the outcomes. Actors tendto&#13;
respond more readily to constructive stimuli.&#13;
&#13;
22.      Taking into account the lessons learned, the proposedprogram i s designed to be a foundation bloc&#13;
for the long-term comprehensive development o f tertiary education inAfghanistan. The preparation o f&#13;
the strategic development plan and the block grant proposals at the institution and faculty levels will&#13;
promote stakeholder consultations, contributingto consensus buildingfor the reform agenda. The&#13;
renewal o fblock grants will be made contingent upon successful implementation and satisfactory&#13;
performance, which, it i s envisaged, will act as a positive stimulus for the stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
C.       PROPOSED PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
Objective&#13;
&#13;
23.      The development objective o fthe proposedprogram is to progressively restore basic operational&#13;
performance at a group o f core universities inAfghanistan. This will provide an institutional base for an&#13;
agenda focusing on tertiary education development, capacity buildingand reform.&#13;
&#13;
24.      The proposed program i s envisaged to be the first-phase ina longer-term strategy for higher&#13;
education development inAfghanistan. Moreover, it aims to act as a catalyst inattracting various&#13;
resources to Afghan tertiary education with a long-term development framework.&#13;
&#13;
ProgramDescription&#13;
&#13;
25.      The programwill support the strategic planning and implementation o f the development and&#13;
reformprogram at key higher education institutionsthrough two major components: block grant and&#13;
university partnership program. This i s complemented and supported by the higher education system&#13;
reform through Technical Assistance. This is envisaged as the first phase o f the Bank's long-term support&#13;
inthe development o fthe higher education system inAfghanistan.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                      Priorities will be given to faculties that address the national development needs&#13;
                      and enhance the national identity o f Afghanistan, including, engineering,&#13;
                      management, economics/finance, IT,and literature and languages. The decision&#13;
                      will take into account strategic development needs o f the country and&#13;
                     coordination with other development partners.&#13;
&#13;
                      A Memorandumo fUnderstanding(MOU) including a service contract between&#13;
                      the institution(s) inAfghanistan and a foreign university or a consortiumo f&#13;
                     foreign universities will be signed for three years. However, the annual renewal&#13;
                      o f the M O U will be subject to the satisfactory performance o f the partner&#13;
                      university.&#13;
&#13;
1.2. Block Grants to  To complement Component 1.1, block grants would be awarded to key faculties&#13;
UniversitiesEaculties and universities, with annual renewal subject to adequate performance against&#13;
(US$ 31 million)      targets. The six universities listed in component 1.1will be participating inthe&#13;
                      block grant component. First,university administrators and faculty members&#13;
                      would develop a strategic development plan with technical assistance. The&#13;
                     MOHE inconsultation with the universities will engage expert consultants to&#13;
                     facilitate the strategic development processes o f universities. Based on the plan&#13;
                      and the prioritization o f universityand faculty needs, grant proposals would be&#13;
                     prepared. As part o f the grant proposalpreparation, consultations with faculty&#13;
                      and students will be encouraged to ensure that prioritization o f the institution's&#13;
                     needs have been decided upon in a consultative manner. An independent&#13;
                      committee would evaluate the grant proposals, ensuring that they are focused on&#13;
                     outcomes, award the block grants, and evaluate the implementation performance&#13;
                     o f the concemed universities and impact o f grants. The independent committee&#13;
                     would consist of: the Deputy Ministers o f Higher Education (Administration and&#13;
                     Academic Affairs), the director o fplanning inMOHE, a representative from the&#13;
                     private sector, and a representative from a "peer" university.&#13;

28.      This sub-component will be coordinated by the MOHEthrough a steering committee andits&#13;
existingdepartments. The MOHE, inconsultation with universities has beeninstillinginterest from&#13;
foreign universities to form partnerships with Afghan universities invarious fora duringthe past two&#13;
years. This sub-component will buildupon this past effort. After consulting with participatingAfghan&#13;
universities(Balkh, Herat, Kabul, Kabul Polytechnic, Kandahar and Nangarhar), the M O H E will invite,&#13;
on behalf o fthe universities,Expressions o f Interest (EOI) for partnership from universities abroad&#13;
separately for each o f the faculties selected for program support. Faculties to be supported will be&#13;
selected based on strategic development needs o f the country and the support from other development&#13;
partners. They will include engineering, management, finance/economics, IT, language, and other^.^&#13;
Foreign universities will be allowed to submit EOIs on their own or through a consortium with other&#13;
universities. EOIs will be evaluated by a committee comprising o frepresentatives from MOHEand a&#13;
representative of each university, and chaired by the Deputy Minister o f Higher Education. A preliminary&#13;
short list o f three to five universities will be prepared for each faculty based on the documentation&#13;
submittedand agreed-upon selection criteria. The short-listed universities will be invited to come to&#13;
Afghanistan for further face-to-face discussions. The universities ranked first based on the EO1and&#13;
discussions for each o f the disciplines will be invited to submit a combined technical and financial&#13;
proposal. Upon successful completion o fnegotiations, the committee with the universitieswill&#13;

&#13;
1.2      BlockGrants to Universities(US$31 million)&#13;
&#13;
29.      The primary purpose o f block grants i s to enable universities to implement the prioritized and&#13;
focused areas o f the strategic plan and to restore the basic operational performance o f universities. Block&#13;
grants are expected to support the installationo f basic administrative systems and procedures and to&#13;
improve academic programs in order to enhance the performance o f universities, especially in selected&#13;
key faculties. It can also beutilized for establishing a new program such as management/administration&#13;
studies. Block grants can be used to procure goods (equipment and supplies), services (technical&#13;
assistance, scholarships, training) and civil works (rehabilitation o f physical facilities directly related to&#13;
delivery o f academic programs).&#13;
&#13;
30.      Block grants will be provided for four years (FY 1385-1388), subject to satisfactory performance&#13;
eachyear. The release o f the each tranche will be determined based on the benchmarks. The proposed&#13;
benchmarks are discussed inAnnex 2. The sizes o f first, second, third and fourth tranches will be around&#13;
15%, 30%, 30% and 25% respectively o f the total block grants to be allocated.&#13;
&#13;
31.      The tranches o f approved grants will be released to a bank account opened for implementation o f&#13;
the program in each o f the universities. The bank account will be inthe name o f the Ministry o f Finance,&#13;
however, three individuals from the universities will be designated as authorized signatories.&#13;
&#13;
30.      For implementation o f the program, a Program CoordinationTeam (PCT) will be appointed in&#13;
each o f the universities. Each university supported by the program will be fully authorized to use block&#13;
grants according to the plans agreed upon. Kabul University and/or Kabul Polytechnic UniversityPCT&#13;
will also be assigned to provide technical support to other universities. This arrangement is expectedto&#13;
helpcross-fertilizationas well as effective implementationo fthe program.&#13;

  Procurement&#13;
&#13;
  32.          Procurement under the proposed project will be carried out inaccordance with the World Bank's&#13;
  Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and I D A Credits (May 2004); and Guidelines: Selection and&#13;
  Employment of Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers (May 2004), and the provisions stipulated inthe&#13;
  Development Grant Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33.     The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for the university partnership&#13;
programs under the Component 1; and the consultant's services under Component2. This plan has been&#13;
agreed uponbetween the Recipient and the Project Team. Procurement o f goods (equipment and&#13;
supplies) and works (rehabilitation o f physical facilities directly relatedto delivery o f academic&#13;
programs) will be carried out by the faculties o fthe universitiesusingthe block grants. For procurement&#13;
underthe block grants to the universities, each universitywill develop its own Procurement Planand&#13;
furnishitto the WorldBankfor review and approval, prior to initiating any procurementprocess. The&#13;
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
34.     There may be procurement o f works for the rehabilitation o f physical facilities directly related to&#13;
delivery o f academic programs, under the block grants. These will mostly be small value works, which&#13;
may be procuredby inviting at least three quotations from the local qualified contractors. Inthe case o f&#13;
NCB, the procurement will be done usingthe StandardBiddingDocuments (SBD) agreed with (or&#13;
satisfactory to) the Bank. N o works contract i s envisagedthrough International Competitive Bidding&#13;
(ICB).&#13;
&#13;
35.     There will be procurement o f equipment and suppliesby the universitiesusing the block grants.&#13;
Small value procurement (less than US$50,000) will be carried out through shoppingmethod. However,&#13;
inthe case ofNCB, the procurement will becarried out usingthe StandardBiddingDocuments (SBD)&#13;
agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank. N o goods procurement i s envisaged through ICB.&#13;
&#13;
36.     The University Partnership Programs are expectedto be large value contracts; however, given the&#13;
nature o f the services, the selection o fthe universities will be carried out following the Consultants'&#13;
Qualifications method. The detailed process i s described inparagraph 28.&#13;
&#13;
37.     Procurement will be primarily carried out by the Government Central Procurement Unit with&#13;
technical inputs from the university executive committees and the respective faculties. Only small value&#13;
procurement not exceeding US$25,000 per contract will be carried out by the respective faculties,&#13;
following the simple procurement methods, usingthe block grants. The respective faculty may involve&#13;
the General Services procurement staff, however, the process will be executed under the leading faculty.&#13;
Since most o f the small value procurement would be done through shopping method or may involve&#13;
selection o f individual consultants, a user's manual on the process o f shopping and on the method o f&#13;
hiringindividual consultants, followingthe bank's procedures, will be providedto the university&#13;
faculties. A workshop will also be organized to explain the above procurement procedures, once the&#13;
procurement plan i s preparedby the respective universities for usingthe block grants.&#13;
&#13;
38.     The Bank's prior review will be required for (i)    procurement o f goods, estimated to cost US$&#13;
200,000 or more per contract, (ii)  procurement o f works estimated to cost US$ 500,000 or more, (iii)   all&#13;
procurement through Direct Contracting, (iv) selection o f consultants (firms) for contracts estimated to&#13;
cost US$ 100,000 or more, (v) all selection through Single-Source and (vi) selection o f individual&#13;
consultant contracts estimated to cost US$ 50,000 or more.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
&#13;
39.     The Bankhas gained substantial experience and understanding o fthe financial management&#13;
environment inAfghanistan through the large number o f projects under implementation over the past&#13;
three years. Recently approved Public Administration and Capacity BuildingProject 3 i s the primary&#13;
instrument to continue and enhance the fiduciary measures putinplace duringthe past three years to&#13;
ensure transparency and accountability for the fundingprovided by the Bank and other donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40.      IDA and several other donors will continue to provide technical assistance for capacity building&#13;
of all line ministries in financial management over the mediumterm. Inorder to provide increased&#13;
institutional autonomy and accountability to Universities, it i s proposed to allow the Universitiesto have&#13;
Development Budget imprest bank accounts. The Ministryo f Finance has issued a Finance Circular on&#13;
Development Budget imprest bank Accounts stating the requirements, rules and conditions for the&#13;
opening o f such Bank Accounts. It i s expected that Finance Officers inUniversities will be appointed to&#13;
manage the block grants, which i s the first step towards buildingfinancial management capacity in&#13;
Universities. Details o f the financial management arrangements are inAnnex 3.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
41,      The proposedprogramhas been preparedunder the Bank's OperationalPolicy 8.50Emergency&#13;
Recovery Assistance. The Environmental and Social Safeguard Framework developed for emergency&#13;
projects inAfghanistan will be applied. The program i s classified as environmentalcategory "C" and no&#13;

Procurement Agent to strengthen procurement inAfghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services&#13;
( A R D S ) ; and for an Audit Agent to support the Auditor General's office. With the assistance o f the&#13;
Financial Management Agent, the Treasury has made considerable achievements over the past two years.&#13;
There i s now a functioning, computerized general ledger and payments system, with some networking o f&#13;
the components. Significant improvements have been made incash management, grant management,&#13;
revenue recording and the recording o f budget appropriations and allotments. The Freebalance software&#13;
installed inTreasury has provento be effective invery quickly establishing a computerizedtreasury&#13;
payment system, Afghanistan Financial Management Information System (AFMIS). It has enabled the&#13;
government to demonstrate to the international community its ability to manage the flow o f donor and&#13;
own resources inan accountable manner. The Procurement Agent has helped ensure the transparency and&#13;
impartiality o f the procurement process for the mass o fprocurement activities undertaken by Bank&#13;
financed     projects. The Audit Agent has played a significant role inthe actual conduct o f audits.&#13;
&#13;
3.         The activities carried out under EPAP 1and 2 have helpedthe Government to ensure that&#13;
appropriate fiduciary standards are maintained for public expenditures, including those supported by the&#13;
Bank and the donor community. PACBP 3 will help ensure that fiduciary standards are further enhanced&#13;
and that capacity i s developed inthe Governmentto maintain these standards.&#13;

Lessons from the first Emergency Education Rehabilitationand Development Proiect&#13;
&#13;
4.         The Emergency EducationRehabilitation and Development Project (2002-2005) supported block&#13;
grants to universities inKabul, and blockplus capitation grants to higher education institutions inthe&#13;
provinces. Block grants proved to be usefulsupport for universities at the start o f the reconstruction&#13;
period as they provided flexibility and cash resources in a timely fashion. Some o f the decisions made at&#13;
the university level with regard to the use o f block grants were ad hoc and did not always address the&#13;
priorities. Inaddition, the unnecessary interventionsby the Ministryo f Higher Educationinthe&#13;
administration (e.g. procurement) o fblock grants by the universities delayed implementation. Inthe&#13;
proposed operation, it i s envisaged that the university partnership program will facilitate the strategic&#13;
planning process o f the universities. The development o f the strategic plan will inturn aid the universities&#13;
inprioritizingtheneeds ofthe institutionandits faculty which will formthe substance ofthe blockgrant&#13;
proposals.&#13;

implementation o f block grants and universitypartnership programs. A Steering Committee inM O H E as&#13;
well as Project Coordination Team o f the Universitiescomprising o f staff from various departments i s&#13;
expected to coordinate the components o f this project.&#13;
&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
&#13;
6.      The flow of funds will be similar to previous projects. (Forfundflow of Block grants to&#13;
Universities,please see separate section under Block Grants to Universities). Project funds will be&#13;
deposited inthe Special Account (SA) to be opened and maintained at a bank on terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to the Association. The SA, inkeepingwith current practices for other projects in&#13;
Afghanistan, will be operatedby the Special DisbursementUnit (SDU) inthe Treasury Department o f&#13;
MinistryofFinance. Requestsfor payments out ofSA funds willbe madeto the SDUbythe relevant&#13;
implementing entities.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Inaddition topaymentsout ofSA funds, the implementingentities couldalso requestthe SDUto&#13;
make direct payments to ForeignUniversities, consultants or consulting firms, and special commitments&#13;
for contracts covered by letters o f credit. Such requests will follow the World Bank procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Block Grants to Universities&#13;
&#13;
8.      Inorder toprovideincreasedinstitutionalautonomy andaccountability toUniversitiesitis&#13;
proposed to allow the Universities to have Development Budgetimprest bank accounts. This i s a&#13;
measure to improve security over cash advances provided to implementing agencies (inthis case&#13;
Universities) for Development Budget Expendituretogether with facilitating execution of multiyear&#13;
projects. The Ministryo f Finance has issued a Finance Circular on Development Budget Imprest Bank&#13;
Accounts stating the requirements, rules and conditions for opening o f such Bank Accounts.&#13;
AccessReplenishments will be through Treasury inMOF which i s an acceptable framework similar to&#13;
other existing projects. The block grant monies are expected to be canalized to the Universities imprest&#13;
bank account through the Special Account located with SDU of the MOF usingexisting procedures for&#13;
withdrawal o f monies by implementingagencies.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Release o f the tranches that have beenawarded to the universities will be linked to progress in&#13;
procurement process. Depending upon the schedule o fpayments, each tranche may be releasedin&#13;
multiple installments. The award o f tranches as well as release o f tranches will be made on&#13;
recommendationo fthe Block Grant Evaluation Committee. The Committee composition and working&#13;
will be stipulated inthe Project ImplementationManual.&#13;
&#13;
10.     The release of monies from the Association to the S A will be inline with Block Grant&#13;
Agreements and Project Implementation Manualwhich i s expected to be prepared under the project for&#13;
mainly management o f Block Grants. The block grant agreement and the project implementation manual&#13;
are expected to spell out a negative list o f expenditures which cannot be funded by such block grants.&#13;
Individual Universities are expectedto come up with their strategic plan along with Annual plans with the&#13;
assistance o f Foreign Partnership Universities for Utilizationo f Block Grants. The flow o f monies to&#13;
Universities from M O F i s expected to follow the funds requirement pattern as per these plans. Inlight o f&#13;
the significance ofblock grants tranches, financial management support to manage the Block Grant&#13;
monies at the universitylevel will be required. Therefore it i s expected that an Afghan Program Finance&#13;
Officer will be appointed ineach Universityto oversee the financial management including accounting,&#13;
reporting, compliance with Block grant agreements and implementation manual functions. The TOR o f&#13;
the Finance Officer will be agreed with IDA. This will be the first step inbuilding financial management&#13;
capacity inUniversities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Existing;Systems and Staffing&#13;
&#13;
11.      The finance and accounting function i s under the Director o f Administration inMOHEand&#13;
generally under the President inUniversities. Presently the accounts and finance staff inM O H E and&#13;
Universities have limitedexperience inmanaging the DevelopmentBudget. Their routine work i s related&#13;
primarily to salaries e.g., payroll preparation, verification and disbursement. Most o f the staff i s not&#13;
adequately qualified and experienced enough to take on immediately the Development Budget&#13;
expenditure. Generally, staff has been intheir positions for over 20-30 years doing the same work and&#13;
only have Bachelors degrees equivalent or a 12'h grade standard o f school education inthe modem&#13;
context. There are major limitations on the diversity o f transactions which are handled as bulk o f their&#13;
budget i s only limited to salaries with a very basic and ad-hoc component o f Operations and Maintenance&#13;
budget. Universities inmost cases are not even aware o f their O&amp;M budget allocations and O&amp;M&#13;
requirements (M-3) are sent to the university accounting department which prepares M-16 and sends to&#13;
the Budget Department o fMOHE for approval. The MOHEreduces the amount or deletes the items inan&#13;
ad-hoc manner inmost cases o f the requirementsbefore they are approved and sent to Treasury in MOF&#13;
for payments through the Da AfghanistanBank. Presently the Minister o f Higher Educationhas&#13;
delegated authority for signing M-16 to the respective Chancellors o f the Universities.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Itis expectedthat aProject Financial Management Specialist (PFMS) with an acceptable TOR&#13;
will be hired to oversee the FinancialManagement function o fthisproject. The PFMS will be locatedin&#13;
MOHEand will work inthe PCT and is also expectedto coordinate the working o fFinance officers in&#13;
various Universities. The PFMS will also assist the Universities inhiring the right candidates for the&#13;
position o f Finance officers. The PFMS through these Finance officers will ensure compliance with&#13;
conditions o f legal agreements, Block Grant agreements and Project ImplementationManual apart from&#13;
facilitating implementation o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
&#13;
13.      The project will follow standard governmental financial management policies and procedures. It&#13;
will use the government wide Chart o f Accounts which has been developed for previous projects and&#13;
which i s currently beingupgraded. Project accounts will be consolidated centrally inthe Ministry o f&#13;
Finance, through the Special DisbursementUnit inthe Treasury. Consolidated Project Financial&#13;
Statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o fproject funds. (For details on Block grants see&#13;
section above). Mainly, universities will operate with cash advances which will ensure the MOF receives&#13;
all the supporting documentation for the eventual use o f the funds and that the uses are booked into&#13;
AFMIS under the government arrangements for budget control and external reporting and that the SOEs&#13;
are duly supported. It also means that the Treasury will scrutinize specific uses and effectively approve&#13;
every transaction.&#13;
&#13;
Intemal Audit&#13;
&#13;
14.      The project financial  management systems will be subject to review by the newly established&#13;
internal audit directorate o f the MOF, according to programs to be determinedby the Director o f Intemal&#13;
Audit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
External Audit&#13;
&#13;
15.      The accounts o f the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with the support o f the Audit&#13;
Agent, with terms o freference satisfactory to the Association. The annual project financial statement to&#13;
the Association would be prepared in accordance with consistently applied accounting standards&#13;
acceptable to the association adequate to reflect the operations, resources and expenditures related to the&#13;
project. The audit of the Project accounts would also include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy o f the&#13;
accounting and internal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate documentation for&#13;
transactions; and (c) the eligibility o f incurred expenditures for Association financing including review o f&#13;
Statement o f Expenditures. The annual Project financial statements audited by the Auditor General,&#13;
supported by the Audit Agent, should be submitted within 6 months o f the close o f Afghan fiscal year, i.e.&#13;
by September 22 of each year. The following audit reports will be monitored inthe Audit Reports&#13;

&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
16.      Financial MonitoringReports (FMRs) will be used for project monitoring and supervision.&#13;
Based on the financial management arrangements envisaged inthis project, the PFMS located inMOHE&#13;
will be responsible for producingFMRswith the inputs from Finance Officers inUniversities Pertaining&#13;
to Block Grants. All expenditure data i s expected to be recorded in a simple accounting system to&#13;
facilitate this process. The Project ImplementationManual will clearly state the books o f accounts and&#13;
records to be maintained along with reportingrequirements for the project. PFMS i s expected to&#13;
undertake a monthly reconciliation with data in SDU (MOF) to ensure that there are no discrepancies.&#13;
&#13;
17.      Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be produced showing: (i)      sources and uses o f funds&#13;
byproject component; (ii)    physical progress; and (iii) o f procurement activities. PFMS will&#13;
                                                         status&#13;
forward the relevant reports to DBERfor consolidation and who will furnishFMRs to IDA within 45&#13;
days o f the end o f the quarter.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Annual project accounts will be consolidated centrally inthe MOF, inparticular, the Treasury&#13;
Department, supported by the Financial Management Agent, and consolidated Project financial&#13;
statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o f Project funds.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Annual Expenditure Statements for Block grants will also be prepared by the Finance Officers in&#13;
Universities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
20.      Financing Percentage. Based on approved Country Financingparameters, disbursement&#13;
percentages have been set at 100%with the understanding, however, that MOF will submit withdrawal&#13;
applications on a net-of-tax basis.&#13;
&#13;
21,      Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA credit would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with full&#13;
documentation or against statements o f expenditures as appropriate).&#13;
&#13;
22.      Use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be made on the basis o f SOEs for&#13;
all expenditures on all contracts not subject to Bank prior review and approval, namely, (i)   contracts for&#13;
goods costing less than US$200,000; (ii)    contracts for individual consultants costing less than US$&#13;
50,000; (iii)contracts for consultant firms and engineering support costing less than US$ 100,000; and&#13;
(iv) all Block Grant Agreements, training and incremental operatingcosts. Two specialized SOE forms&#13;
will be agreed with the government: one for Block Grants and one for reportingall other expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
23.      For all expenditures on contracts subject to Bank prior review and approval, SOEs may not be&#13;
used. Supporting documentation will accompany withdrawal applications, namely: copies o f signed&#13;
contracts (for the first payment claimed on each contract); copies o f contract amendmentdextensions;&#13;
invoices, fee statements or other certificates for paymentprepared by the payee or beneficiary, shipping&#13;
documents for imported goods. All payments under MOUs on the University Partnership Program&#13;
component require full supporting documentation.&#13;
&#13;
24.      Special Account. A Special Account will be opened and maintained ina bank on terms and&#13;
conditions acceptable to the Association; and would be operated by the Treasury Department inthe M O F&#13;
inaccordance with the Association's operational policies. Thee Authorized Allocation ofthe Special&#13;
Account would be set not to exceed the lesser o f 3 months budgetedexpenditures or US$3,000,000 for&#13;
the special account amount. Actual special account usage will beclosely monitored to ensure that excess&#13;
cash balances not beingused for implementationexpenditures do not accumulate.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Minimum Application Size. Applications for replenishment to the Special Account will be&#13;
submitted (a) monthly, earlier if desired by the MOF, but quarterly at the latest regardless o f amount. The&#13;
minimumapplicationsize for withdrawal applications for reimbursement, direct payment, or for&#13;
applications for Special Commitments i s 10% o fthe Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
26.      Authority to Withdraw Credit Funds. M O F will retain the right to sign and submit withdrawal&#13;
applications to the Association, based on the requests received from the MOHE and individual&#13;
universities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
27.      Block Grant DisbursementConditions andMonitoring. For Block Grant disbursements, there are&#13;
two conditions which must be met for each university,prior to any disbursement for that university. Once&#13;
both conditions are met, tranche payments will be inaccordance with Block Grant agreements, for&#13;
amounts authorized by the MOHE. Relevant MOHE and university staff including finance officers will&#13;
be trained on the disbursement protocols and Program ImplementationManual. Use o f Block Grant&#13;
monies and expenditure verification against the criteria will be undertaken duringrouting supervision o f&#13;
financial management arrangements. The client i s not requiredto submit SOEs for Block Grant&#13;
expenditures as part o f its withdrawal submissions but will fold this reporting into the regular quarterly&#13;
FMRs.&#13;

&#13;
General&#13;
&#13;
1.       Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004; and "Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World BankRecipients" dated M a y 2004, and the&#13;
provisions stipulated inthe Legal Agreement. The general description o f various items under different&#13;
expenditure categories are described below. For each consultant contract to be financed by the Grant, the&#13;
different consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior reviewrequirements, and time frame are&#13;
agreed between the Recipient and the Bankproject team inthe Procurement Plan. For procurement under&#13;
the blockgrants to the universities, each university will develop its own Procurement Plan and fumishit&#13;
to the World Bank for review and approval, prior to initiating any procurementprocess. The Procurement&#13;
Plan will be updatedat least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementation needs and&#13;
improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Procurement of Works: There maybe procurement o fworks for the rehabilitation o fphysical&#13;
facilities directly related to delivery o f academic programs, under the block grants. These will mostly be&#13;
small value works, which may be procuredby invitingat least three quotations from the local qualified&#13;
contractors. Inthe case o fNCB, the procurement will be done usingthe Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
(SBD) agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank. N o works contract i s envisaged through International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB).&#13;
&#13;
3.       Procurementof Goods:There will beprocurement of equipment and supplies by the universities&#13;
usingthe block grants. Small value procurement (less than US$50,000) will be carried out through&#13;
shopping method. However, inthe case o fNCB, the procurement will be carried out usingthe Standard&#13;
BiddingDocuments(SBD) agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank. N o goods contract is envisaged&#13;
through ICB.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Selectionof Consultants: The proposedproject consists ofthe following two components.&#13;
Component 1: ProgramDevelopment and Quality Improvement inK e y Higher Education Institutions;&#13;
and Component 2: Higher Education SystemDevelopment&#13;
&#13;
5.       Component 1would facilitate and finance partnership programs for two universities inKabul&#13;
(Kabul Polytechnic University and Kabul University) and four regional universities (Balkh, Herat,&#13;
Kandahar and Nangarhar) with foreign universities. Although the partnership programs are envisaged to&#13;
be large value contracts, because o fthe nature o f the services, the selection o f the partner universitieswill&#13;
be through Consultants' Qualifications method.&#13;
&#13;
6.       There may be some technical assistance contracts under the university block grants. Provisions&#13;
will be there for selection o f consultants for small value contracts (less than US$ 100,000) through&#13;
Consultants' Qualifications method. The default method o f selection will be QCBS.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Component 2 will support technical assistance to define the roles and responsibilities of, and&#13;
relationships between, the Ministry o f HigherEducation and universities. It will also support technical&#13;
assistance for govemance reform o f the higher education system, including the quality assurance system.&#13;
The selection o fconsultants will be carried out through QCBS method, following the Bank's Standard&#13;
Request for Proposals. The estimated cost o fthese assignments is US$350,000 and US$250,000&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Assessment o f the agency's capacity to implementprocurement&#13;
&#13;
8.      The Program CoordinationTeam (PCT) at the university and faculty levels will be responsible for&#13;
implementation o f block grants and university partnership programs. The university-level executive&#13;
committee will consist of: the chancellor, heads o f academic affairs, finance and administration, male and&#13;
female representatives o f faculty members, male and female representatives o f students, and local&#13;
business leaders. The faculty/department-levelPCT will consist of: the dean, head o f administration,&#13;
male and female faculty representatives and male and female students' representatives.&#13;
&#13;
9.      An assessment o fthe capacity o fthe General ServicesDepartment o fKabul University, which&#13;
carries out all procurement for the university, was carried out by Quamrul Hasan on March 8,2005. The&#13;
assessment reviewed the organizational structure o fthe Procurement Section and its interaction and&#13;
modus operandi with the faculties and the administration and finance departments.&#13;
&#13;
10.     The Procurement section was found to have very little procurement handling capacity. The actual&#13;
procurement that this section has carried out so far has been o f small values for procurement o f goods&#13;
such as batteries for vehicles, furniture etc., and nothing exceeding US$2,000 equivalent per contract.&#13;
The procurementwas carriedout primarily throughreceiving quotations by sendingone, two or three&#13;
persons, depending on the value o f procurement, into the local market. Insome cases quotations were&#13;
invited by advertising inthe radio and local newspapers. The Procurement Section consists o f three staff,&#13;
with upto college-level education (twelve years). The procurementcapacity inthe other universitieswas&#13;
deemed to be not much different to that o f the Kabul University Procurement Section.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Most o f the issues/risks concerning the procurement component for implementation o f the project&#13;
have been identified and include (i) o f procurement experience o f the UniversityProcurement&#13;
                                      lack&#13;
Sections (ii)absence o f qualified procurement staff, and (iii) absence o f knowledge on World Bank&#13;
procurementprocedures and good procurement practices.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Consideringthe overall country inherent risk, the overall project risk for procurement i s high.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The corrective measures agreed to mitigate the risks are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Procurement will primarily be carried out by the Government Central Procurement Unit with&#13;
        technical inputsfrom the faculty level executive committees o f the six universities.&#13;
    0   Only small value procurement not exceedingUS$25,000 per contract will be carried out by the&#13;
        respective faculties, following the simple procurementmethods, usingthe block grants. The&#13;
        respective faculty may involve the General Services procurement staff, however, the process will&#13;
        be ledby the faculty. Since most o f the small value procurement would be done through&#13;
        shopping method or may involve the selection o f individual consultants, a user's manual on the&#13;
        process o f shopping and on the method o f hiring individual consultants, following the Bank's&#13;
        procedures, will be provided to the university faculties. A workshop will also be organized to&#13;
        explain the above procurement procedures, once the procurementplan i s prepared by the&#13;
        respective universities for block grant usage. The Government Central Procurement Unit will&#13;
        prepare the user's manual and arrange the workshop.&#13;
    0   For capacity buildingo f the procurement staff at the university general services procurement&#13;
        section, they will take part in future training courses on procurement, arranged under the&#13;
        Government's initiative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procurement Plan&#13;
&#13;
14.       The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for the university partnership&#13;
programs under Component 1and the consultants' services under Component 2. This plan has been&#13;
agreed on between the Recipient and the Project Team and i s provided in Attachment 2 below. For&#13;
procurement under the block grants to the universities, each university will develop its own Procurement&#13;
Plan and furnishit to the World Bank for review and approval, prior to initiating any procurement&#13;
process. The Procurement Planwill be updated at least annually (or as required) to reflect the actual&#13;
project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Frequency o f Procurement Supervision&#13;
&#13;
15.       Inadditiontopriorreviewofcontracts, procurement supervisionwill generally bewiththe&#13;
Project supervision missions. There will be at least one mission, besides the Project supervision missions,&#13;
to visit the universities to carry out post review o f procurement actions.&#13;

            Afghanistan - Strengthening Higher
            Education Program
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Strengthening Higher Education
            Program in Afghanistan aims to progressively restore basic
            operational performance at a group of core universities in
            Afghanistan. This will provide an institutional base for an
            agenda focusing on tertiary education development, capacity
            building and reform. The program is envisaged to be the
            first-phase in a longer-term strategy. The program will
            support the strategic planning and implementation of the
            development and reform program at key higher education
            institutions through two major components: block grant and
            university partnership programs. Component 1 will constitute
            program development and quality improvement in key higher
            education institutions; and component 2 will constitute
            higher education system development.
