The Joint Japan/World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program (JJ/WBGSP) was initiated in 1987&#13;
by the government of Japan at the World Bank Institute to encourage and strengthen human re-&#13;
sources development in developing countries. The program's mandate is to provide to mid-ca-&#13;
reer professionals in developing countries an exposure to the latest techniques and knowledge&#13;
on development through graduate studies. Since its inception, the JJ/WBGSP has awarded a to-&#13;
tal of 3,554 scholarships for studying in 250 universities in 32 World Bank member-countries&#13;
through the sole funding of the Japanese government.&#13;
    In 2005, the JJ/WBGSP launched the Scaling-Up Program as a better means fore leveraging&#13;
knowledge acquired by the sponsored scholars and to foster a network of development practition-&#13;
ers, including JJ/WBGSP scholars and alumni. The JJ/WBGSP has been providing opportunities&#13;
for scholars to generate new knowledge for development. The World Bank recognizes that there is&#13;
a great opportunity to tap into this knowledge, which would benefit not only the scholars but also&#13;
the development community. During its first year of activity, the Scaling-Up Program held two re-&#13;
gional conferences and started developing the community of scholars and alumni. The regional&#13;
conferences, both held in May 2006, provided an opportunity for alumni to hear outstanding pa-&#13;
pers presented by the scholars, and to network, share knowledge, and discuss current development&#13;
issues in the presence of the World Bank staff and Japanese government representatives.&#13;
    The high-profile attendees for these conferences included (in alphabetical order, with honorifics&#13;
omitted): Kabir Ahmed, Chief Administrative Officer and Supervising Manager for JJ/WBGSP,&#13;
WBI; Colin Bruce, Country Director for Kenya, World Bank; Daisuke Matsunaga, Minister, Em-&#13;
bassy of Japan in Vietnam; Satoru Miyamura, Ambassador of Japan to Kenya; Kilemi Mwiria, As-&#13;

A Study of Roadside Slope Management in Bhutan&#13;
&#13;
Chimi&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This report is an attempt not only to demonstrate an alternate approach to applying soil bioengineering to&#13;
stabilize roadside slope but also to demonstrate its applicability in the day-to-day maintenance of roads in&#13;
Bhutan. The study was carried out to seek an economic, ecological, and easy-to-apply approach to road&#13;
maintenance. Soil bioengineering has been introduced in Bhutan, but so far has not attained its optimal&#13;
use there. The study therefore focused on finding a soil bioengineering approach that would increase its&#13;
successful use in rehabilitating roadside slopes. Field trips in and around Yokohama and Tokyo offered an&#13;
opportunity to study the success of the Miyawaki method of reforestation in stabilizing or rehabilitating&#13;
failed slopes in Japan. A phytosociological study of vegetation was carried out to identify the appropriate&#13;
species for plantation. The Braun-Blanquet approach was used to analyze data on vegetation, and a trial&#13;
plot of land was maintained and observed for a year to evaluate the applicability of the Miyawaki method&#13;
of reforestation on Bhutan's roadsides. Results indicate that the method will be useful in stabilizing road-&#13;
side slopes and should be made an integral part of routine road maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bhutan, located in the Himalayan ranges, is a very mountainous country. It covers an area of&#13;
40,076 square kilometers. Its mountains are high and rugged; and an intricate network of deep&#13;
valleys, ravines, and depressions earmarks water courses and drainage basins. Bhutan's biotic&#13;
features are as diverse as its geophysical features. Through its natural endowments and biolog-&#13;
ical diversity, the kingdom has acquired special global significance. With a population exceed-&#13;
ing 634,000 people, Bhutan is one of the least densely populated countries, and approximately&#13;
79 percent of the people live in rural areas.&#13;
    Because of its location in the Himalayan ranges, almost all roads in Bhutan are built by cut-&#13;
ting into the mountain slopes. In addition to the challenges of building roads in such difficult&#13;
terrain, maintaining existing roads is of great concern. There are many problems in operating a&#13;
road network in a country with difficult geological characteristics and scarce financial resources,&#13;
and resolving those problems requires finding an economical means of maintaining the existing&#13;
road network. Understanding the geological features of Bhutan is essential to understanding&#13;
the problems associated with road operation there. Past studies and various earlier projects&#13;
have indicated that landslides and soil erosion are the main causes behind the high cost of oper-&#13;
ating Bhutan's road network. Although it has not been widely used, roadside soil bioengineer-&#13;

2     A Study of Roadside Slope in Bhutan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ing always has been viewed as a cheaper alternative solution to civil engineering structures&#13;
when used for stabilizing slopes and controlling erosion.&#13;
   The study reported here had two objectives:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Identify an alternative approach to implement soil bioengineering for roadside slope&#13;
       maintenance&#13;
   2. Identify routine maintenance activities for better efficiency and cost effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
   My initial literature review concentrated on various aspects of Bhutan's road maintenance&#13;
and management and on the country's geological setting. After obtaining a clearer perspective&#13;
on road operation and related problems, I divided the study into three main components. The&#13;
first portion of the study analyzed Bhutan's road maintenance problems overall, and focused&#13;
particularly on roadside soil bioengineering and plant communities.&#13;
   The second part of the study involved maintaining a trial roadside plot selected as representa-&#13;
tive of a typical roadside slope failure. To supplement what I had learned in my study of plant&#13;
communities, I also carried out a vegetation survey on eight roads in the country's western region.&#13;
   In the third part of the study, I gleaned lessons from slope maintenance experience in Japan,&#13;
where rehabilitating failed slopes with appropriate planting is exemplary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Topography and Floristic Ecosystems&#13;
&#13;
Bhutan's prevalent topographic features are the high Himalayas close to the northern border&#13;
and the large mountain ranges and deep valleys that run southward (figure 1.1). The topogra-&#13;
phy is dominated by ridges oriented north to south and by the five major river systems. The&#13;
mountain slopes are mostly steep and long, with close to limiting angles of stability (Chencho&#13;
Norbu et al. 2003). The steep and unstable terrain and the relatively young mountain system&#13;
render the country ecologically very fragile.&#13;
   The kingdom has extensive biological diversity. Forests in Bhutan can be divided into three&#13;
major zones based on altitude: an alpine zone at 4,000 meters; a temperate zone between 2,000&#13;
and 4,000 meters, which contains the major conifer and broadleaf forests; and a tropical zone&#13;
that lies between 150 and 2,000 meters and contains tropical and subtropical vegetation.&#13;
   The general climatic conditions are hot and wet in the south, dry and cold in the north, dry&#13;
and warm in the inner valleys, and alpine-arctic in the high Himalayas. Southern Bhutan re-&#13;
ceives heavy and intense orographic rainfall, with annual means in the range of 2,500­5,000 mil-&#13;
limeters, and precipitation decreases northward. In general, 80 percent of the rainfall occurs&#13;
during the summer months of June to September, and it can vary within relatively short dis-&#13;
tances because of rain shadow effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Road Network&#13;
&#13;
Layout and Road Location&#13;
&#13;
Bhutan has just over 4,100 kilometers of roads. Most of the road network was constructed be-&#13;
tween 1961 and 1987, and the work was done manually and with minimal use of technology.&#13;
The road network layout is dominated by one major highway traversing the country from east&#13;
to west and four north-south roads that connect to it. Historic trends in road construction show&#13;
that from 1961 to 1987, as construction costs rose, shorter and shorter roads were built. Not only&#13;
has the cost of construction increased tremendously, but also the expense of maintaining the&#13;
roads has risen a great deal.&#13;
   If the road network layout (figure 1.2) is superimposed on a topographic map of the country,&#13;
we find that the current road network is built within the middle and lower Himalayan ranges&#13;

corresponding to the alpine, temperate, and tropical zones. The road system, mainly consisting&#13;
of the east-west highway, goes through very high passes, many of which experience freezing&#13;
conditions in winter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Problems Associated with Road Maintenance&#13;
&#13;
Roads and their construction have great potential to disturb the delicate balance of existing land&#13;
forms and the local environment. Geological conditions in Bhutan, further aggravated by high&#13;
precipitation, make it extremely difficult and costly to build and maintain roads. Because all the&#13;
roads in Bhutan are built by cutting into mountain slopes, there are free-cut faces that are prone&#13;
to continuous erosion and seepage. Landslides caused by inappropriate construction techniques,&#13;
slope instability, and inadequate drainage are major problems. Significant numbers of landslides&#13;
along the roads are caused by other factors as well, such as construction of irrigation channels,&#13;
logging, quarrying, cultivation practices, and inappropriate disposal of excavated materials.&#13;
   Introducing environmentally friendly road construction (EFRC) methods in 1999 was ex-&#13;
pected to reduce environmental damages resulting from road building. The method, introduced&#13;
initially for roads constructed with World Bank assistance, involves the following features: bal-&#13;
anced cut/fill, transport of loose spoil materials to predesignated dumping yards to reduce&#13;
damage caused by their disposal over the valley slopes, good side/cross drains, soil bioengi-&#13;
neering, and so forth. Cost estimates for roads built with the EFRC method show that the initial&#13;
cost is approximately 30 percent higher than the conventional construction method (RGoB&#13;
1999). In the long run, however, roads built with EFRC methods are expected to be more eco-&#13;
nomical because of lower routine maintenance requirements and less geological disturbance at&#13;
the time of construction.&#13;
   The photos in figure 1.3 show typical conditions along the existing roads in Bhutan. Because&#13;
the roads are cut into mountain slopes, the roadside slopes are regularly damaged by mudslides,&#13;
especially during the monsoon season. Very frequently, the roadside slopes are not protected&#13;
against failure, even by such engineering structures as retaining walls. These conditions lead to&#13;
two principal problems: extensive monsoon restoration and very costly routine maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   HIGH COST OF MONSOON RESTORATION. Monsoon rainfall is a major cause of road deteriora-&#13;
tion in Bhutan. The quality of the road network is diminished every year by the monsoon rains.&#13;
Restoring the roadways normally is categorized as "emergency maintenance" simply because&#13;
expenditures to repair the damage are unpredictable. The restoration work includes landslip&#13;
clearance, repair of washouts, and repair and construction of retaining structures to stabilize the&#13;
slopes. Figure 1.4 shows the trend of monsoon damage restoration costs over a five-year period,&#13;
1999­2003. During 2001, expenditures exceeded Nu. 190 million, which is more than Nu. 47,500&#13;
per kilometer of road. (In Bhutanese ngultrum, Nu. 45 is approximately US$1.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. Problems resulting from monsoon rains also lead to higher general&#13;
maintenance costs. An overview of the routine maintenance system reveals that the budget set&#13;
for maintaining each road depends on that road's classification (or the importance of each class):&#13;
national highway, district road, feeder road, or urban road. Roads in Bhutan, however, have&#13;

Soil Bioengineering&#13;
&#13;
Soil bioengineering is an age-old technique that uses living plants for engineering purposes&#13;
(Lewis 2000).1 It is an integrated technology that uses engineering practices in conjunction with&#13;
ecological principles to design and construct a vegetative living system that prevents erosion&#13;
and landslides (Bayfield, Barkar, and Yah 1992). Unlike other applications where plants are&#13;
chiefly an aesthetic component, plants in roadside soil bioengineering are an important struc-&#13;
tural component. Their developing root systems control erosion, stabilize slopes, and restore the&#13;
landscape. The basic goal of soil bioengineering is to accelerate site recovery by mimicking what&#13;
would happen naturally. Whenever soil erosion or landslides occur, either naturally or as a re-&#13;
sult of human actions, the bioengineered site begins to heal itself. The slope adjusts and vegeta-&#13;
tion establishes itself when the angle of repose has settled.2&#13;
                    Soil bioengineering was introduced in Bhutan toward the end of the 1990s, with the publica-&#13;
tion of Bioengineering in Bhutan: Interim Manual for the Road Sector on Bioengineering Techniques for&#13;
Slope Protection and Stabilisation (RGoB 1999) and Rural Access Project: Field Handbook on Bioengi-&#13;
neering (RGoB 2002). Application of the technique, however, has not yet reached a desirable&#13;
scale (perhaps because of limited related knowledge and limited funds). Retaining structures&#13;
commonly are used to stabilize failed slopes along the road network, and roadside planting is&#13;
included in neither the routine maintenance activity list nor any other work classification. Envi-&#13;
ronmental protection and preservation is a major national goal in Bhutan, so it is timely and&#13;
suitable to develop a means for enhancing the way soil bioengineering is used to maintain and&#13;
repair roads--and thus protect and preserve the environment as economically as possible.&#13;
                    Current methodologies (RGoB 1999, 2002) outlined for roadside slope stabilization need to&#13;
be reviewed to achieve better success or to trigger wider use. Therefore, instead of continuing&#13;
with the existing manuals and methods, it is critical to explore alternative approaches to road-&#13;
side soil bioengineering that offer greater likelihood of success.&#13;
                    It is true that soil bioengineering is inadequate in controlling for deep failures and major&#13;
landslides, but much of Bhutan's slope instability is shallow seated and begins in a small way,&#13;
spreading only if unchecked. Erosion areas often begin small and expand over time to a size that&#13;
requires costly traditional engineering solutions. Therefore, implementing soil rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    1. Because there is ample literature available about soil bioengineering, the discussion here is limited to&#13;
a few general points about the advantages and possible benefits of bioengineering and about the status of&#13;
its adoption in Bhutan.&#13;
                    2. Research has shown that trees and shrubs can provide deeper slope reinforcement than can grasses&#13;
(Grimshaw and Helfer 1995).&#13;

methods with bioengineering provides economic savings. Robinson, Danielson, and Snaith&#13;
(1998, p. 4) have stated convincingly that US$1 of expenditure on road maintenance results in&#13;
US$3 of savings to the road users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Phytosociology Study&#13;
&#13;
Plants are the most important component of soil bioengineering. The success of stabilizing&#13;
slopes with plantings depends to a great extent on the plants' survival success. And that sur-&#13;
vival depends on selecting the right plants for each site. Therefore, to apply this methodology&#13;
successfully, we need to understand plant phytosociology--the characteristics, classifications,&#13;
relationships, and distribution of plant communities (Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg 1974). It&#13;
is useful to collect related data to describe and understand the population dynamics of a species&#13;
and how it relates to other species. To gain a practical understanding of the plant community&#13;
and the potential natural vegetation available for slope bioengineering, in March 2004 I con-&#13;
ducted a phytosociology study along roads in the western region of Bhutan, surveying eight&#13;
plots adjacent to the roads. These plots, located within an elevation of 1,200­4,000 meters, are&#13;
adjacent to roads with high human traffic--logging, grazing, cultivation, and settlement. I un-&#13;
derstood that detailed study was needed to identify species of vegetation that are native to the&#13;
area and likely to survive the road use.&#13;
    To analyze the data collected during this field survey, I used Braun-Blanquet table analysis&#13;
(Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg 1974). In these tables, the species common to several relevés are&#13;
identified and emphasized, and attention is paid to the species that are characteristic of the plot&#13;
being studied. These common species groups are key to identifying vegetation units. My analy-&#13;
sis comprised three stages. First was the field survey in which I recorded every individual species&#13;
I found. The second stage involved table analysis in which I tabulated the field relevé data in&#13;
three subsequent tables--the raw table, the frequency table, and the differential table.3 In the&#13;
third stage I compiled the summary of vegetation. It comprised five vegetation groups: temper-&#13;
ate (Alnus) forest, moist subtropical forest, subalpine coniferous forest, Quercus forest, and pine&#13;
forest. The vegetation summary data are shown in table 1.1. Available data on rainfall show that&#13;
the western Bhutan areas where the eight study plots were located receive monsoon rainfall,&#13;
with maximum precipitation occurring between July and August, and have dry winter seasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Miyawaki Method&#13;
&#13;
In my effort to identify the most beneficial approaches to bioengineering for Bhutan, I studied&#13;
the Miyawaki method of reforestation as it has been used in Yokohama and Tokyo, Japan. The&#13;
method, also known as environmental protection forestry (Miyawaki, Fujiwara, and Ozawa&#13;
1993), is characterized by (1) use of native species, (2) dense and mixed plantation, and (3) use of&#13;
potted seedlings. See figure 1.5 for a schematic representation of the method.&#13;
    The method reconstructs the complex forest ecosystem by means of woody plants. Based on&#13;
the principles of forestry and ecology, the Miyawaki method has applied the fundamental theo-&#13;
ry of potential natural vegetation as well as natural succession of efficient vegetation recon-&#13;
struction. Simply stated, this method of site recovery mimics the natural vegetation of an area. It&#13;
also shortens the considerable successional time required to reach an area's climax vegetation&#13;
(that is, the natural vegetation ecology of that area). This method of recovering eroded sites has&#13;
been applied in Japan, where more than 300 successful cases have been recorded (Miyawaki,&#13;
Fujiwara, and Ozawa 1993). The method can prevent the risks inherent in monoculture plant-&#13;
ing, which is vulnerable to harmful insects, landslides, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    3. Completion of the raw table revealed 262 different species of plants recorded in the eight plots surveyed.&#13;

Results of the Phytosociology Study&#13;
&#13;
The findings from my phytosociology study and visual inspection have produced species rec-&#13;
ommendations for soil bioengineering along the roads surveyed (table 1.2). The most desirable&#13;
site characteristics are identified for each recommendation.&#13;
    Because of their steepness, however, roadside slopes may need to be made less acute, with&#13;
the angle of slope/gradient lowered prior to planting. This can be done by providing bamboo&#13;
mats or preparing stepped fencing with pieces of cut wood and split bamboo. Use of bamboo&#13;
mats also is recommended for gentle slopes with grainy or sandy soil conditions to prevent ero-&#13;
sion of the surface by rain or the effect of gravity over time. Wooden crib walls will be effective&#13;
as a retaining structure in lower altitudes with higher rainfall intensity. For more seriously erod-&#13;
ed roadside slopes or minor landslide areas, gabion walls filled with rocks or earth are recom-&#13;
mended because gabion walls are flexible to pressure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Experimental Plot&#13;
&#13;
During the study, I also selected and maintained an experimental plot on Dechencholing-Tango&#13;
Road, very close to vegetation survey plot BH8. The plot was typical of a slope failure along the&#13;
road. Immediately after the initial landslide during the 2003 monsoon, a stone masonry retain-&#13;

ing wall was built to contain further failure. A year after that first landslide, the failed slope still&#13;
looked bare. Visual inspection revealed that the slope appeared fragile and vulnerable, particu-&#13;
larly during the subsequent monsoon.&#13;
   The site, a subalpine coniferous forest, was rehabilitated with plantings during my period of&#13;
observation (see table 1.3). The trial plot's natural vegetation is listed in table 1.1 under columns&#13;
BH1, BH2, and BH8.&#13;
   Because potted seedlings (as suggested for the Miyawaki method) were unavailable, I col-&#13;
lected saplings from neighboring forests. I gave the saplings simple treatments, such as leaf re-&#13;
moval to prevent water loss through transpiration prior to root formation. Following the princi-&#13;
ples of the Miyawaki method, I planted three to four saplings in a square meter and mulched&#13;
the surface with leaf litter.&#13;
   Table 1.3 shows the saplings' survival rates five months after planting. Given that the plant-&#13;
ing experiment was carried out with no slope dressing or preparation, that there was no main-&#13;
tenance whatsoever, and that the trial plot was subjected to sporadic grazing, the saplings' rates&#13;
of survival are impressive; and they imply that a more planned application will be successful&#13;
and economically beneficial, and will enhance the aesthetics of the roadside slopes. The pro-&#13;
gressive development of the site from late March 2004 to May 2006 is depicted in the figure 1.6&#13;
photos. It is clear that, with some small assistance, nature will rehabilitate itself. With a little&#13;
care, wild saplings can be used in place of the potted seedlings suggested in the Miyawaki&#13;
method. The trial also demonstrated the use of native species and a plantation method that dif-&#13;
fers from the methods outlined in the existing handbooks, and it helped raise awareness about&#13;
the importance of soil bioengineering.&#13;

Japanese Example&#13;
&#13;
I made field visits to areas around Yokohama, Japan, to gain insight on slope maintenance there.&#13;
Overall, I noted that the methods used to stabilize roadside slopes are highly resource intensive,&#13;
but there also are places where soil bioengineering has been used effectively for this purpose. In&#13;
Tochigi Prefecture, Enna Road, Nasu-Shiobara, passes through terrain very similar to the roads&#13;
in Bhutan. The road, constructed by cutting into mountain slopes, is characterized by frequent&#13;

landslides. Although constructed at an initial cost of approximately ¥10,000 million, Enna Road&#13;
is now closed to public use because of the high cost of maintaining it. Despite its closure, the&#13;
prefecture continues to maintain it, using gabion box walls rather than concrete structural walls.&#13;
The gabion boxes are more in keeping with the area's dense vegetation, and many places along&#13;
the roadside have been stabilized with plantings and Miyawaki reforestation.&#13;
    Other places I visited in Japan were the Shonan Village in Hayama, Yokohama, and the cam-&#13;
pus of Yokohama National University. Both of these places originally were abandoned golf&#13;
courses, and now are transformed entirely. One striking feature is that both these areas have&#13;
been rehabilitated with the Miyawaki method of reforestation. See figure 1.7 for photos of plots&#13;
successfully stabilized and recovered by this method.&#13;
    Although there are financial, technological, and resource differences between Japan and&#13;
Bhutan, the success of the method in Japan suggests it will be successful in Bhutan. Japan is a re-&#13;
source-rich country that could have selected any modern technology to restore and maintain&#13;
land, but it took the ecological path and found that it worked. Bhutan is a resource-poor nation&#13;
with all the more reasons to try this less costly method and expect the same success.&#13;

Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
Despite the small size of the country, Bhutan's topography and environmental conditions vary&#13;
widely. Maintenance of roads, therefore, must be rooted in the specific nature of the surround-&#13;
ing environment. Current maintenance practice is fairly arbitrary, and there has been little&#13;
change in road maintenance or management over time. With the expansion of road networks, it&#13;
will be uneconomical if alternatives or supplementary approaches are not explored. The prob-&#13;
lem of roadside slope instability has prompted the Royal Government of Bhutan's Department&#13;
of Roads to experiment with soil bioengineering, but it has done so sporadically. At this point,&#13;
bioengineering has no widespread importance and has been given only nominal application,&#13;
except in some externally funded projects.&#13;
   Against the backdrop of construction and maintenance methods occasioned by the lack of fi-&#13;
nancial resources, I studied the broader application of roadside soil bioengineering as a method&#13;
of day-to-day road maintenance in Bhutan. I wanted to show that stabilizing soil with plantings&#13;
will go a long way as a cost-saving measure if attempts are made at an early stage, and that the&#13;
technique will be more widely applied if the probability of success is greater.&#13;
   Soil bioengineering not only complements the landscapes and the natural beauty of the&#13;
country, but it also supports the government's policy of environmental protection and nature&#13;
conservation. Rehabilitating failed slopes with the Miyawaki method is nothing less than recre-&#13;

ating natural forests, and it offers greater advantages than monoculture planting that has a&#13;
higher risk of future erosion and disease.&#13;
    The experimental plot I studied demonstrated that site recovery and land stabilization are&#13;
much quicker with soil bioengineering. A year after its failure, the unrestored site remained bare&#13;
and fragile; but a year after its rehabilitation, the slope has stabilized. Natural species have en-&#13;
croached to complement the saplings planted manually.&#13;
    The role of vegetation and small-scale engineering works may be questionable in the face of&#13;
larger landmass movement. For deep failures and major landslides, soil bioengineering is inad-&#13;
equate for slope stabilization. But much of Bhutan's roadside instability begins small, is shallow,&#13;
and spreads only if nothing is done to shore it up. Routine maintenance of roadside slopes using&#13;
indigenous plantings will control surface erosion. Indigenous species adapted to local climate&#13;
and soil conditions are the best options from all points of view, including cost effectiveness.&#13;
    In view of the number of kilometers added each year to the existing road network, it is clear&#13;
that the most viable solution is to take advantage of the rich ecological resources available to re-&#13;
pair the slope damage caused by landslides and to recreate natural ecosystems through plantings.&#13;
    One of the key goals of my study was to find a means of ensuring higher rates of success for&#13;
roadside bioengineering. I found that linking soil bioengineering with a study of phytosociolo-&#13;
gy based on the Braun-Blanquet approach and the Miyawaki method of reforestation is a prom-&#13;
ising option. My study of the plant communities on eight plots along the roads in western&#13;
Bhutan enabled me to understand the characteristics, relationships, and distribution of plant&#13;
communities. That is critical information for anyone preparing a recovery plan for failed or de-&#13;
graded sites because greater success is likely when species that occur in the adjacent or neigh-&#13;
boring forests are used to rehabilitate the slopes.&#13;
    A wider application of the Miyawaki reforestation method not only will result in economic&#13;
savings but also will enhance roadside aesthetics more than can the traditional geotechnical ap-&#13;
proaches. Successful soil bioengineering efforts will produce much more stable roadside slopes&#13;
and reduce slope failures. It will lower the cost of monsoon restoration, and there will be gener-&#13;
al reduction in the cost of road maintenance.&#13;
    To realize the full advantages of soil bioengineering, it is necessary to apply it on a much&#13;
wider scale in Bhutan. Wider application demands that the methodology be incorporated as one&#13;
of the country's routine maintenance activities. To promote its being formally introduced in&#13;
day-to-day road maintenance, I recommend the following actions:&#13;
&#13;
    ·  Develop individual maintenance plans for each road, based on the local characteristics--&#13;
       climate, soil, altitude, and so forth.&#13;
    ·  Establish a schedule for routine road maintenance that is based on actual surveyed needs.&#13;
    ·  Develop within the Department of Roads a body of knowledge about vegetation science&#13;
       to ensure careful selection of woody plants for reforestation. Recovering a site in a way&#13;
       that mimics the neighboring natural forest will reduce the need for road maintenance&#13;
       and repair.&#13;
    ·  Train the workforce in the skills needed for soil bioengineering.&#13;
    ·  Adapt the Miyawaki method to suit Bhutanese circumstances.&#13;
    ·  Use wild saplings from neighboring forests when potted seedlings are not available. Take&#13;
       advantage of the rich biotic resources available in Bhutan.&#13;
    ·  Train the road workforce to develop and maintain seedlings. This will provide needed&#13;
       plant materials and enhance the workers' capabilities.&#13;
    ·  Train local people and organizations to grow seedlings from nearby plants. This is partic-&#13;
       ularly suitable for maintaining local or individual access roads.&#13;

Long-run Effects of Fiscal Deficit on&#13;
Economic Growth in Ghana, 1970­2000&#13;

The study examines the long-run effects of fiscal deficits on output growth in Ghana for the period 1970&#13;
to 2000. It adopted a growth accounting model with slight modifications. A dummy variable to capture&#13;
the political environment of the economy is included. Standard economic theory requires the variables to&#13;
be stationary, so the econometric methodology first examines the stationarity of the variables using the&#13;
augmented Dickey-Fuller (p) test. A time-series analysis is conducted with particular attention paid to&#13;
the causal relationship between deficits and growth in the context of the Granger causality test. The re-&#13;
sults provide evidence that there is a relationship between deficits and output growth. Regression analy-&#13;
sis of the data reveals that deficits impede economic growth in Ghana. Specifically, an increase of 1 percent&#13;
in deficit will result in a 12 percent decline in the growth of gross domestic product. The empirical results,&#13;
based on the long-run deficit­growth model, also reveal that changes in deficits, inflation, and the nature&#13;
of the political environment have negative effects on growth, whereas exports, the level of money stock,&#13;
foreign direct investment, and private investment have positive effects. Recommendations resulting from&#13;
this study include policy consistency between fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic targets, and the&#13;
shifting of government reliance on donor inflows to dependence on internal resources. This shift should be&#13;
accomplished by strengthening the ability of Ghana's revenue mobilization agencies to increase revenues&#13;
by widening the tax base rather than by increasing the tax rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recent decades have witnessed intense debate on the effectiveness of fiscal policy in stimulating&#13;
economic growth. The main focus has been on whether government activity promotes or re-&#13;
tards economic growth. According to neoclassical growth theory, fiscal policy does not affect the&#13;
steady-state growth rate. In contrast, new growth theories allow an important role for fiscal pol-&#13;
icy in the growth process.&#13;
    Conceptually, we can think of fiscal deficits as a measure of the extent to which a govern-&#13;
ment is spending beyond its means. In precise mathematical terms, the fiscal deficits are the dif-&#13;
ference between the total expenditure of the government and the sum of its "revenue receipts"&#13;
and those "capital receipts" that do not create any future payment obligations.1&#13;
    Macroeconomic instability in Ghana has been fueled to a large extent by government policies&#13;
that have resulted in a persistent overshooting of the expected budget deficits, and by the meas-&#13;

ures used to finance the growing deficits. Key factors that have accounted for the government's&#13;
tendency to exceed expected deficits include weak revenue mobilization mechanisms and antic-&#13;
ipatory spending (that is, spending in anticipation of donor inflows)--especially debt moneti-&#13;
zation and the sale of treasury bills.&#13;
    Among the principal objectives of Ghana's fiscal policy are to stabilize and reduce domestic&#13;
debt with a view to stemming the increase in interest payments and to achieve the desired eas-&#13;
ing in real interest rates. Thus, fiscal policy management is geared toward reducing fiscal&#13;
deficits and, consequently, government borrowing. The main element of the strategy to achieve&#13;
the fiscal policy objectives is improved resource mobilization. Strategies adopted to improve fis-&#13;
cal resource mobilization include minimizing revenue leaks in all revenue collection agencies&#13;
(the Internal Revenue Service, the Customs and Preventive Service, and the value added tax);&#13;
reviewing and revising existing taxes by instituting measures that widen the tax base; establish-&#13;
ing fees and user charges; strengthening the revenue collection institutions; and strengthening&#13;
the district assemblies for improved tax collection. Huge budget deficits and associated infla-&#13;
tion hikes can heighten uncertainty about government policies, and thus may increase the risk&#13;
premium in Ghana, resulting in domestic and foreign investors not having confidence in the&#13;
country's economy. Such large fiscal deficits also can lead to an explosion in domestic debt that&#13;
can crowd out credit to the private sector, further constraining firms' financing options.&#13;
    Financing the deficit by issuing high-yield treasury bills has inverted the yield curve on gov-&#13;
ernment securities (ECA 2003) that always has been negative (and only changed in 2002), giving&#13;
more rewards to investors in short-dated securities than to those in long-term securities. As a re-&#13;
sult, many potential investors prefer to hold short-term instruments, and that restricts private&#13;
firms' abilities to raise long-term capital. This means of deficit financing also has shifted re-&#13;
sources from the securities market to the government bill market, leaving the securities market&#13;
thin and less liquid. For instance, between 1995 and 2002, private investments averaged only 4.1&#13;
percent of gross domestic product (GDP), despite the recent improvements in fiscal discipline.&#13;
    Because of high deficits at the central government level and high losses in state-owned en-&#13;
terprises, the ratio of public sector debt to GDP stood at 159.0 percent in 2002--twice as high as&#13;
in Senegal (78.8 percent). Ghana's fiscal performance currently compares unfavorably with that&#13;
of its peers because of weaknesses in expenditure management and heavy reliance on volatile&#13;
foreign grants. As a result of these fiscal weaknesses, combined with external vulnerabilities,&#13;
Ghana experienced large currency depreciations, high levels of inflation, and interest rate in-&#13;
creases between the late 1970s and 2000. Average inflation, which stood at an expected 26.9 per-&#13;
cent in 2003, is much higher in Ghana than in other B-rated countries--such as Senegal (2.3 per-&#13;
cent), which is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union.&#13;
    In 2001, the government acted to reduce deficits and debt by introducing new taxes and cur-&#13;
tailing expenditures, but it could not prevent a further accumulation of domestic arrears and re-&#13;
course to domestic financing. The 2002 budget output did not reduce the government's recourse&#13;
to domestic financing because of unbudgeted increases in the wages of health and education&#13;
staffs, inadequate control of wage expenditure in some ministries, new shortfalls in official as-&#13;
sistance, and higher-than-budgeted utility subsidies. These factors have raised certain issues,&#13;
and this study seeks to address the following questions:&#13;
&#13;
    1. What has been the trend in Ghana's fiscal deficits over the period from 1970 to 2000?&#13;
    2. What has been the trend in that country's economic growth over the same period?&#13;
    3. What has been the relationship between fiscal deficits and economic growth from 1970&#13;
        to 2000?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Study Objectives&#13;
&#13;
The main objective of this study is to examine the effect of fiscal deficits on output growth in&#13;
Ghana from 1970 to 2000. Specifically, the study seeks to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                   Bernice Serwah Duodu  19&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    ·  Define the causal relationship between output growth and fiscal deficits, if one exists&#13;
    ·  Identify the trends in fiscal deficits over the period 1970 to 2000&#13;
    ·  Identify the trends in economic growth over the same period&#13;
    ·  Make policy recommendations based on the study findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Importance of the Study&#13;
&#13;
The effect of fiscal deficits on growth in Ghana is quite significant for policy decisions, especial-&#13;
ly in achieving the goals of the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy so that the economy will be&#13;
managed effectively to enable wealth creation for the benefit of all Ghanaians. Fiscal deficits&#13;
contribute to a low level of national saving, which then reduces domestic investment and in-&#13;
creases borrowing from abroad. Reduced national saving raises domestic interest rates,2 which&#13;
crowds out private investments, reduces the rate of employment, and attracts capital from&#13;
abroad. The external borrowing that helps finance budget deficits is reflected in a larger current&#13;
account deficit, thus creating a link between the budget deficit and the current account deficit.&#13;
    Given that Ghana's government engaged in an ambitious fiscal consolidation program that&#13;
was expected to lead in 2004 to a central government deficit reduction to 2.4 percent, the overall&#13;
budget deficit was 3.2 percent of GDP, compared with the targeted 1.7 percent of GDP. There-&#13;
fore, estimating fiscal deficit and growth has more than academic motivation. The estimation re-&#13;
sults can help government tax revenue collection agencies forecast revenue needed to match&#13;
government expenditures over a particular period and so have a balanced budget.&#13;
    This study hopes to bring to light a basis for formulating policies that provides certainty in&#13;
budget projections. Such projections would enhance confidence in the country's macroeconom-&#13;
ic environment and promote private sector­led growth to sustain the expansion of output and&#13;
employment. It is the government's plan to create an enabling environment in which the private&#13;
sector can grow, and the results of this study will provide vital input for economic growth mod-&#13;
eling of the Ghanaian economy.&#13;
    Furthermore, knowing the signs of relevant variables in the deficit­growth model can help&#13;
policy makers formulate policies that will accelerate growth and alleviate poverty. The analysis&#13;
should stimulate debate between policy makers who wish to change policies and those who&#13;
wish to maintain them.&#13;
    Finally, there is very little literature on the relationship between fiscal deficits and growth in&#13;
Ghana, so this study intends to add to the relevant body of knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Review of the Literature3&#13;
&#13;
Chronic government fiscal deficits and escalating government debt have become major con-&#13;
cerns in both developed and developing countries, so the purpose of this portion of the study is&#13;
to examine some of the major theoretical arguments and empirical studies on fiscal deficits and&#13;
economic growth.&#13;
    At a theoretical level, much of the literature focuses on the relationship between private in-&#13;
vestment and public expenditure, mainly because of the crowding-out effect of public spending&#13;
(see, for example, Bailey 1971; Buiter 1977; Premchand 1984; Yellen 1989; and Barro 1990). Some&#13;
of these studies, such as Premchand (1984), asserted that financing the budget deficit by bor-&#13;
rowing from the public implies an increase in the supply of government bonds. To improve the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    2. The increase in interest rates also may exert a negative influence on aggregate demand through sev-&#13;
eral channels. First, the increase in interest rates reduces investment, which is a component of aggregate&#13;
demand. Second, the increase directly may reduce interest-sensitive consumption, such as on credit-fi-&#13;
nanced durable goods. Third, rate increases indirectly may reduce consumption by reducing asset values&#13;
and, therefore, household net wealth.&#13;
    3. Most of the literature is drawn from Saleh (2003).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
attractiveness of these bonds, the government offers them at a lower price, which leads to high-&#13;
er interest rates. The increase in interest rates discourages issuance of private bonds, private in-&#13;
vestment, and private spending. In turn, this contributes to the financial crowding out of the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
    Other literature addressing fiscal deficits' effects on growth focuses on the relationship be-&#13;
tween deficits and inflation. For example, Metzler (1951), Patinkin (1965), Friedman (1968), Sar-&#13;
gent and Wallace (1981), Dwyer (1982), and Miller (1983) argued that government deficit spend-&#13;
ing is a primary cause of inflation. Some of those studies (such as that of Sargent and Wallace)&#13;
have supported the proposition that the Central Bank will be obliged to monetize the deficit ei-&#13;
ther now or in later periods. Such monetization results in an increase in the money supply and&#13;
in the rate of inflation, at least in the long-term period.&#13;
    Miller (1983) argued that government deficits necessarily are inflationary, irrespective of&#13;
whether the deficits are monetized. According to Miller, deficit policy leads to inflation through&#13;
different channels. For instance, even if the Central Bank does not monetize the deficit, deficits&#13;
produce inflation through crowding out. That is, nonmonetized deficits lead to higher interest&#13;
rates; higher interest rates crowd out private investment and hence reduce the rate of growth of&#13;
real output. Higher interest rates also spur the financial sector to innovate in the payment sys-&#13;
tem and make government bonds more substitutable for money.&#13;
    Barro (1978; 1979) has suggested that deficits are a result of inflation, rather than a prompt for&#13;
it. The government deficit is the change in the nominal value of outstanding government bonds.&#13;
If the anticipated inflation increases, then the nominal value of bonds must increase to maintain&#13;
the real value of outstanding bonds. In addition, the monetarists have argued that there is a pos-&#13;
itive link between government deficits and monetary growth, asserting that higher bond-fi-&#13;
nanced deficits will put upward pressure on interest rates and on government bonds. Because&#13;
the Central Bank is concerned with smoothing interest rate movements, it would then tend to&#13;
increase the money supply (Darrat 1985).&#13;
    In addition, other studies focus on the relationship between the fiscal deficit and the trade&#13;
deficit ("twin-deficits relationship"). The twin-deficit hypothesis asserts that an increase in the&#13;
fiscal deficit will cause a similar increase in the current account deficit. As part of an extensive&#13;
body of literature on the topic, Fleming (1962), Mundell (1963), Volcker (1987), Kearney and&#13;
Monadjemi (1990), and Smyth and Hsing (1995) have argued that government deficits might&#13;
cause trade deficits through different channels. For example, in a Mundell-Fleming framework,&#13;
it is argued that an increase in the budget deficit would induce upward pressure on interest&#13;
rates, causing capital inflows and an appreciation of the exchange rate that will increase the cur-&#13;
rent account deficit. The Keynesian absorption theory suggests that an increase in the fiscal&#13;
deficit would induce domestic absorption and, thus, import expansion, causing a current ac-&#13;
count deficit.&#13;
    Volcker (1987) argued that budget deficits lead to trade deficits and that both hinder eco-&#13;
nomic growth in the long run. Fieleke (1987) provided the theoretical basis for the relationship&#13;
between the budget deficit and the trade deficit. He argued that&#13;
&#13;
    the dominant theory is that an increase in government borrowing in a country will, other&#13;
    things being equal, put upward pressure on interest rates (adjusted for expected infla-&#13;
    tion) in that country, thereby attracting foreign investment. As foreign investors acquire&#13;
    the country's currency in order to invest there, they bid up the price of that currency in&#13;
    the foreign exchange market. The higher price of the country's currency will discourage&#13;
    foreigners from purchasing its goods but will conversely encourage residents of the&#13;
    country to use their now more valuable currency to purchase foreign goods, so that the&#13;
    country's current account will move toward a deficit (or toward a larger deficit). In addi-&#13;
    tion, any increase in the country's total spending resulting from the enlarged government&#13;
    deficit will go partly for imports and for domestic goods that would otherwise be export-&#13;
    ed, also worsening the current account balance (pp. 173­74).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                            Bernice Serwah Duodu  21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Moreover, other literature has concentrated on the relationship between the fiscal deficit and&#13;
the exchange rate (for example, Allen [1977], Bisignano and Hoover [1982], Penati [1983], Bran-&#13;
son [1985], Hakkio [1996], and Stoker [1999]). Some of these studies, such as that by Bisignano&#13;
and Hoover, argued that deficits may appreciate or depreciate the exchange rate, depending on&#13;
the relative importance of the wealth effect and relative asset substitution effects.&#13;
    Hakkio (1996) provided a summary of the indirect effects of a deficit on the exchange rate. He&#13;
argued that a deficit reduction can cause a higher demand for loanable funds through three ma-&#13;
jor channels: lower expected inflation, lower foreign exchange risk, and a greater expected rate of&#13;
return on domestic assets because of lower inflation. Large or out-of-control budget deficits that&#13;
are financed by printing money lead to higher inflationary expectations (Hakkio 1996).&#13;
    Even if the debt is not monetized, its large size could convince the markets that it eventually&#13;
will be paid through an inflation tax. A credible attempt to control the deficit lowers inflationary&#13;
expectations and the inflation premium on long-term interest rates. According to the Fisher ef-&#13;
fect, nominal long-term interest rates could decline by the same percentage, and real rates&#13;
would remain the same. If nominal long-term interest rates do not fall as much as the expected&#13;
inflation premium has declined, however, real long-term rates would increase. Thus, a deficit&#13;
reduction makes domestic assets more attractive and causes the currency to appreciate. Further-&#13;
more, the overall effect of a deficit reduction on the exchange rate is dependent on whether the&#13;
deficit reduction is credible, long-term, and sustainable.&#13;

Overview of Trends in Fiscal Deficits and Growth&#13;
&#13;
To examine the fiscal deficit­growth relationship in Ghana, we need to examine trends in fiscal&#13;
deficits and economic growth. This portion of my study offers some insights into the records of&#13;
these two variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trends in Fiscal Deficits&#13;
&#13;
Fiscal deficit is the excess of expenditure over revenue plus interest payments on domestic and&#13;
foreign debt.4 Since the early 1960s when overindulgence in modernization and import substi-&#13;
tution led to excessive government spending, the public budget in Ghana (even if narrowly de-&#13;
fined) registered deficits until 1986 (figure 2.1). Between 1965 and 1985, the narrowly defined&#13;
deficit averaged about 5 percent of GDP annually. To finance the deficit, government relied&#13;
mostly on internal borrowing from the banks and from the nonbank public. Before the time of&#13;
the Economic Recovery Program (ERP), reliance on external borrowing to finance Ghana's fiscal&#13;
deficit was negligible. Kwame Nkrumah's pride of place as the champion in the fight against&#13;
neocolonialism prevented his government from seeking budgetary support from the Bretton&#13;
Woods institutions, whose activities he viewed as imperialist. During the governments of the&#13;
National Liberation Council (1966­69) and the Progress Party (1969­72), an adjustment program&#13;
sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) opened the door to external borrowing to&#13;
finance the deficit. In 1970, the deficit was almost fully financed from external borrowing.&#13;
    The trend toward external borrowing to finance the deficit turned in 1972, when Ignatius&#13;
Acheampong's National Redemption Council took power from the Progress Party government&#13;
and repudiated some of Ghana's external debts. Ghana was then blacklisted in the internation-&#13;
al financial community. From 1973 to 1979, and even running through the years of the Armed&#13;
Forces Revolutionary Council to the People's National Party and into the early years of the Pro-&#13;
visional National Defence Council (1979­83), Ghana could raise very little external finance to&#13;
support its deficit. Over these years, government borrowed heavily from the banking sector to&#13;
finance the deficit.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Fiscal performance in the ERP period (1983 onward) has been quite different from the per-&#13;
formances of past regimes. Somehow, government expenditure has been restrained in both real&#13;
and nominal terms. Several "cost-saving" and "cost-recovery" measures have been introduced&#13;
in most public departments and services. Subsidies on health and education have been re-&#13;
moved. Hospital fees have been introduced at government hospitals, and parents now are re-&#13;
quired to pay more for the education of their wards. Government expenditure has consistently&#13;
been kept at 14 percent of GDP. As part of the measures to maintain the restraint on expenditure,&#13;
the public sector wage bill has been pegged at 5 percent of GDP, forcing government to retrench&#13;
public employees. On the revenue-producing side, efforts at tax collection have been intensi-&#13;
fied, and the tax net has been widened. Restrained government spending and enhanced rev-&#13;
enue collection have eliminated the deficit (narrowly defined) since 1986.&#13;
    It is interesting to note the importance of foreign inflows to the Ghana budget in the ERP era.&#13;
The international credibility that Ghana gained in its economic turnaround under the ERP has&#13;
translated into external capital inflow that has supported the budget and the balance of pay-&#13;
ments. Since 1986, external support also has helped pay off some internal public debt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trends in Economic Growth&#13;
&#13;
There always has been the view that the economy of Ghana could and should grow faster than&#13;
it has (see Aryeetey and Fosu 2005). The nation's recent growth record is deemed inadequate for&#13;
achieving the Millennium Development Goals by the year 2015. In 1993, Ghana set itself the tar-&#13;
get of becoming an upper-middle-income country by 2020 under its Vision 2020 program. To&#13;
achieve the targeted per capita income by that year, it was reckoned that the economy needed to&#13;
grow at an annual average of 8 percent. However, the economy has not shown a capacity to&#13;
move toward the target. The performance of the economy and the economic growth have been&#13;
characterized by not attaining macroeconomic goals. In particular, whereas the GDP was ex-&#13;
pected to grow between 7.1 percent and 8.3 percent in the period 1996­2000, actual growth was&#13;
between 4.2 percent and 5.0 percent. The significant deviation between targets and the actual&#13;
performance translated into low per capita GDP growth and poor sectoral growth.&#13;
    Ghana's growth record has been one of unevenness when we compare the postreform period&#13;
with the earlier period, as figure 2.2 clearly indicates. After a reasonably strong GDP growth in the&#13;
1950s and early 1960s, the Ghanaian economy began to experience a slowdown in GDP growth in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                                     Bernice Serwah Duodu             23&#13;

1964. Growth was turbulent during much of the period after the mid-1960s and began to stabilize&#13;
only after 1984. In 1966, 1972, 1975­76, 1979, and 1980­83, the growth rate was negative.&#13;
    It is interesting that the years in which negative growth was experienced generally coincided&#13;
with changes in government and sometimes with policy changes or reversals. Indeed, negative&#13;
growth was first recorded at the time of the first coup d'etat in 1966, with a forceful transfer of au-&#13;
thority from the dictatorial Nkrumah regime to the military. The lowest growth (­14 percent) oc-&#13;
curred in 1975, coinciding with oil price shocks and a policy reversal from a moderately market-&#13;
oriented stance to an inward-looking protectionist regime. The period of turbulence, however,&#13;
also had positive growth episodes, with the peak rate reaching 9 percent in 1970 and 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    DEVELOPMENTS FROM 1960 TO 1965. This period was characterized by the preparation and im-&#13;
plementation of a Seven-Year Development Plan: 1963/64­1969/70, under the Nkrumah&#13;
regime, in which bold efforts were made to modernize the economy through industrialization.&#13;
Therefore, it is not surprising to see that physical capital accumulation over this period was the&#13;
most significant contributor to output growth. At the macroeconomic level, however, the econ-&#13;
omy was in decline. This decline reflected a deteriorating balance of payments position and the&#13;
poor credit rating accorded the country as it struggled to expand its economy rapidly. The coun-&#13;
try registered three consecutive years of negative growth in per capita GDP between 1964 and&#13;
1966, and inflation increased from 1.0 percent in 1957 to 22.7 percent in 1965.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    DEVELOPMENTS FROM 1966 TO 1971. The deteriorating economic situation and the fall in living&#13;
standards were given as the reasons why a group of army and police officers overthrew the&#13;
Nkrumah government in February 1966. In 1969, the military regime handed over power to the&#13;
civilian government of Dr. K. A. Busia. The government introduced IMF-sponsored monetary&#13;
reforms, devalued the currency, and liberalized the external sector (Frimpong-Ansah 1991). Un-&#13;
der the military, disinflation policies aimed at stabilizing the macroeconomy were implemented.&#13;
There was a reduction in domestic investment, tighter control over import licenses, and a deval-&#13;
uation of the cedi (Killick 1978). The objective of stabilization was largely achieved. GDP growth&#13;
increased from ­0.2 percent in 1967 to 1.2 percent by 1969.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    DEVELOPMENTS FROM 1972 TO 1983. As observed earlier, the 1970s and early 1980s saw the most&#13;
significant decline in per capita GDP growth, with the decline in total factor productivity being&#13;
the most significant contributory factor. This was not surprising because the period was one of&#13;
sustained deterioration in the economy under five "different" governments, and it has been de-&#13;
scribed aptly by Aryeetey and Tarp (2000) as one of "muddling through." Under the different&#13;

&#13;
governments--mostly military--the policies of the period emphasized import substitution, un-&#13;
derpinned by a restrictive foreign exchange regime, quantitative restrictions on imports, and&#13;
price controls, with the state playing a major role as producer. The dramatic contraction between&#13;
1970 and 1983 entailed declines in per capita GDP of more than 3.0 percent a year, in industrial&#13;
output by 4.2 percent a year, and in agricultural output by 0.2 percent a year (Tabatabai 1986).&#13;
    Successive governments responded with import controls, which fell disproportionately on&#13;
consumer goods. Consumer goods as a proportion of imports fell from 20.2 percent in 1975 to&#13;
17.1 percent in 1980. Once again, the continuing economic decline was the pretext under which&#13;
Flt. Lt. Jerry John Rawlings staged a coup d'etat in December 1981, establishing the Provisional&#13;
National Defence Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    DEVELOPMENTS FROM 1984 TO 2000. The Structural Adjustment Program was one for the eco-&#13;
nomic liberalization of various sectors of the economy. Exchange rate policy, fiscal and mone-&#13;
tary policies, privatization, and trade policies all saw dramatic changes with increased liberal-&#13;
ization of the economy. The growth trends (shown in figure 2.2) suggest clearly that there has&#13;
been a marked contrast in the growth performance of the Ghanaian economy since the reforms.&#13;
Obviously, this is different from the question of whether this growth is enough. Indeed, since&#13;
1983, annual GDP growth rates have averaged 5 percent, with the output of cocoa, minerals,&#13;
and timber increasing significantly. And inflation fell from the very high prereform levels (122&#13;
percent in 1983) to 10 percent in 1992.&#13;
    Furthermore, the fiscal condition of the economy reverted to its earlier ill health in the 1990s.&#13;
It registered a deficit of 11 percent of GDP (government deficits, excluding grants), nearly paral-&#13;
leling the 12 percent rate for the control period of 1975­84, and slightly more than twice the ra-&#13;
tio during the earlier phase of the reform era. Much of this worsening in the government budg-&#13;
et deficit could be attributed to substantial increases in government expenditures, which, as a&#13;
percent of GDP, increased by 9.0 percent over the previous period, compared with an increase in&#13;
government revenues of only about 3.0 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Model Specification, Estimation, and Empirical Results&#13;
&#13;
In this section we'll consider the empirical model used in estimating the effects of fiscal deficit&#13;
on growth in Ghana.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Model Specification and Formulation&#13;
&#13;
For this study I adapted the growth accounting model of Lin (1994), with slight modifications&#13;
resulting from the lack of data. Kweka and Morrissey (1999) adapted the same model for their&#13;
study to investigate the impact of public expenditure on economic growth in Tanzania. Accord-&#13;
ing to those investigators, output (Y) is assumed to be a function of productive inputs, capital&#13;
(K) and labor (L). The two sectors, government (g) and private (p), possess each of the two fac-&#13;
tors of production. In such a setting, output is a function of the two factors of production and&#13;
government expenditure (G). The assumption is that government services affect the efficiency of&#13;
productive units of capital and labor, either positively or negatively. In the context of develop-&#13;
ing countries, exports (X) and foreign capital (F) are potential determinants of growth and can&#13;
be included. Additionally, change in capital can be expressed as investment (I). Government ex-&#13;
penditure can be decomposed into productive (Ig) and unproductive (Cg) components, with Ip&#13;
as private investment (I = Ig + Ip). Mathematically,&#13;
&#13;
                                            Y= aIp a1 La2 Iga3 Cga4 Xa5 Fa6,                    (2.1)&#13;
&#13;
where a1 through a6 are elasticities. With no suitable time-series measure of labor, they as-&#13;
sumed that labor inputs can be proxied by government expenditure on human capital. There-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                Bernice Serwah Duodu   25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
fore, with e = the error term, the base regression (with variables expressed in natural logarithms)&#13;
is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
               In Y =In a + a1In Ip + a2 In Ig + a3 In Cg + a4 In X + a5 In L + a6 In F + e.        (2.2)&#13;
&#13;
    Because the objective of the study is to investigate the effects of fiscal deficits on growth,&#13;
deficit becomes an important explanatory variable of interest and was thus included. Foreign&#13;
capital is a component of foreign direct investment, so I proxied foreign capital with foreign di-&#13;
rect investment to look at the totality of foreign inflows to the country, in the form of either cap-&#13;
ital or technology. Also, most growth models include other macroeconomic variables that have&#13;
an effect on growth, so this study included inflation and the level of money stock as part of the&#13;
explanatory variables because they have the tendency to distort economic stabilization.&#13;
    A dummy variable to capture the political environment of the economy also was included:&#13;
D = 1 for a democratic era and D = 0 for a military regime.&#13;
    Finally, the model to be used for the regression analysis is specified as&#13;
&#13;
                    In RGDP = In a + a1 In PVTINV + a2 In MGRO + a3 In DEFT +                       (2.3)&#13;
                              a4InEXPT+a5InFDI+INFL+PDUM+e.&#13;
&#13;
The regression variables are defined in table 2.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Test of Hypotheses&#13;
&#13;
To achieve the stated objectives, the following hypotheses were tested:&#13;
&#13;
    ·  H0: fiscal deficits exert no effect on economic growth in Ghana (H0: a3 = 0).&#13;
    ·  H1: fiscal deficits exert an effect on economic growth in Ghana (H1: a3  0).&#13;
&#13;
    The null hypothesis (H0) states that fiscal deficits have no effect on economic growth. That is,&#13;
the variable cannot explain the variation in growth, and fiscal deficits are not significantly dif-&#13;
ferent from zero. The alternative hypothesis (H1) implies that a fiscal deficit is significantly dif-&#13;
ferent from zero. In other words, the explanatory variables have an effect on explaining the&#13;
changes in economic growth in Ghana.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data Sources&#13;
&#13;
The study relies heavily on secondary (time-series) data obtained from various publications of&#13;
the Ghana Statistical Service and on information gathered from world tables published by Johns&#13;
Hopkins University, the International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics Yearbook&#13;
(various issues), the World Bank's World Development Indicators 2003, and various Internet sites.&#13;
    Annual data for the period 1970­2000 are used to estimate the model specified. These data&#13;
are presented in the annex to this chapter (table 2A.1).&#13;

Estimation Procedures&#13;
&#13;
TEST FOR STATIONARITY. As a preliminary analysis, data are checked for stationarity. If the series&#13;
are nonstationary, using standard econometric techniques can point to misleading results, so&#13;
standard economic theory requires the variables to be stationary. However, a group series test&#13;
was conducted to find the extent of correlation among the variables (see table 2A.2).&#13;
   The econometric methodology first examines stationarity using the augmented Dickey-&#13;
Fuller, or ADF, (p) test (Dickey and Fuller 1979; 1981). The test, applied to each individual series,&#13;
consists of running the variables at their levels, first difference of series with the series lagged&#13;
once, and with the option of intercept and trend.&#13;
   First, I report the characteristics of the data by showing the unit root test results of the indi-&#13;
vidual variables in the model (table 2.2). The table gives the t-statistic and the probability val-&#13;
ues. The L(.) and DL(.) are the log levels and the first difference, respectively, with (.) represent-&#13;
ing the variables. I performed the tests using EViews 3.1 statistical software to compute both&#13;
ADF statistics and their critical values.&#13;
   As table 2.2 indicates, LRGDP, LPVTINV, LMGRO, INFL, and LFDI were stationary at their&#13;
levels and were significant because their critical values were less than the ADF statistics at the 1&#13;
percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels of significance. The retained residual of the equation&#13;
also was stationary at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent significance levels. The results in-&#13;
cluded their graphs (see figure 2A.2).&#13;
   The results presented in table 2.2 show that not all the variables were stationary at the levels.&#13;
This is because the ADF statistics were less than their critical values, and thus we accept the null&#13;
hypothesis that the variables are not significantly different from zero. However, they were sta-&#13;
tionary at the first difference, as presented in table 2.3. (Figure 2A.3 in the annex presents the&#13;
graphs of the unit root test at their first difference.) In table 2.3, the ADF statistics are reported&#13;
with the probability values in parentheses. The results show that the first difference of the vari-&#13;
ables being tested was stationary at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels of signifi-&#13;
cance. The results also suggest that GDP depends on the change in the level of the variables' sta-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                    Bernice Serwah Duodu    27&#13;

&#13;
tionarity at first difference. That is, GDP depends on the change in the level of deficit and,&#13;
specifically, on the change in the level of exports in Ghana.&#13;
    Combining the results of tables 2.2 and 2.3, I conclude that the variables LRGDP, LPVTINV,&#13;
LMGRO, LFDI, and INFL are integrated of order zero: Xt I(0), where Xt is a vector of these vari-&#13;
ables, whereas DLDEFT and DLEXPT are integrated of order one: Xt I(1), where Xt is a vector of&#13;
the variables mentioned. This leads to a reasonable assumption that there is a relationship&#13;
among the variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST. A degree of correlation between two variables does not necessarily&#13;
mean there is a causal relationship between them; it simply may be attributable to the common&#13;
association of a third variable. Detecting causal relationships among a set of variables, however,&#13;
is one of the objectives of empirical research, so I used the Granger causality test to search for&#13;
causal relationships. The concept of causality in the Granger approach is based mainly on the&#13;
assumption that the future cannot cause the past; rather, the past and present cause the future.&#13;
The Granger (1969) approach to the question of whether deficit causes growth is to see how&#13;
much of the current growth can be explained by past values of growth. Growth is said to be&#13;
Granger-caused by deficit if deficit helps in the prediction of growth. To investigate the causali-&#13;
ty between GDP and deficit, I performed a simple Granger causality test, the outcome of which&#13;
is shown in table 2.4.&#13;
    Two lags of each variable were used and the test considered the reverse causation. Given the&#13;
low F-statistics and high probability values reported for the null hypothesis, I reject the null hy-&#13;
pothesis for the test. This result indicates that there is a causal relationship between fiscal deficit&#13;
and output growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    TEST FOR COINTEGRATION. Cointegration is the statistical implication of the existence of a long-&#13;
run relationship between economic variables. The test stipulates that if variables are integrated&#13;
of the same order, a linear combination of the variables will be integrated of that same order.&#13;
The idea behind cointegration analysis is that, although macro variables may tend to trend up&#13;
and down over time, groups of variables may drift together. If there is some tendency for some&#13;
linear relationships to hold among a set of variables over long periods of time, then cointegra-&#13;
tion analysis helps us discover it. If the variables are integrated of different orders, however,&#13;
there is some linear combination of the two series that is stationary. In other words, instead of&#13;
being I(1), the linear combination is I(0).&#13;
    I applied a unit root test to the retained residual (ER) to determine its stationarity, excluding&#13;
trend and intercept. The ADF test revealed that the retained residual is stationary at its level&#13;
(that is, of I[0] series) and significant at the conventional 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent lev-&#13;
els of significance. This implies that output growth is cointegrated with the other variables, and&#13;
that there exists a linear combination of the variables that is stationary. This finding leads to a&#13;
conclusion that there are long-run equilibrium relationships among the variables.&#13;

Empirical Results&#13;
&#13;
The results of the overparameterized deficit­growth model are presented in table 2.5. In an at-&#13;
tempt to work toward a more parsimonious equation, this study adopted a general-to-specific&#13;
modeling approach in the estimation process. This process imposes lag structures of all the vari-&#13;
ables in the cointegrated equation (eq. 2.4). Moreover, this technique makes it possible to deal&#13;
with irrelevant variables rather than omitting relevant ones (see Thomas 1993). Using the Akaike&#13;
information criterion,5 the significance of the individual variable, and the adjusted R2 as a guide,&#13;
the estimated equation was reduced to a more parsimonious model (see table 2.6). The estimate&#13;
shows that the coefficients of all the regressors (explanatory variables) have the expected signs.&#13;
    The R2 value of 0.944579 shows that all variations in output growth can be explained by the&#13;
explanatory variables. In other words, about 94.44 percent of the changes in output growth can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    5. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) often is used in model selection for non-nested alternatives--&#13;
smaller values of the AIC are preferred (Eviews 3.1 help system).&#13;

be explained by the parameter. The high F-statistic (22.72513) illustrates that the parameters (ex-&#13;
planatory variables) are jointly significant and that the explanatory variables are capable of ex-&#13;
plaining the variation in output growth, the dependent variable. Also, the Durbin-Watson sta-&#13;
tistic (2.0) indicates that there is no serial autocorrelation.&#13;
    It is evident from the result that changes in deficit, the variable of interest, are significant at&#13;
the 1 percent level, and the coefficient of the variable suggests a negative effect on growth. This&#13;
implies that a 1 percent increase in deficits will result in a decline of approximately 1 percent in&#13;
economic growth. The implication is that the more the government spends beyond its revenue or&#13;
income, the more deficits will accumulate and must be financed. Financing the deficits by bor-&#13;
rowing from the public leads to higher interest rates, and that discourages private investment&#13;
and private spending. Reduced private investment and spending contribute to the financial&#13;
crowding-out of the private sector and consequently exert a negative effect on growth. This evi-&#13;
dence is consistent with Arora and Dua's (1993) results. Their study suggested that higher fiscal&#13;
deficits crowd out domestic investment and increase trade deficits. This is also in line with the&#13;
findings reported by Karras (1994), who concluded that deficits are negatively correlated with&#13;
the rate of growth of real output, and that increased deficits do appear to retard investment.&#13;
    The estimate also revealed a positive relationship between changes in exports and growth,&#13;
and this is significant at the 5 percent level. This means that a 1 percent increase in exports will&#13;
boost growth by 6 percent. This relationship is in line with results reported by Little, Scitovsky,&#13;
and Scott (1970). They contended that by encouraging exports, including agricultural exports, a&#13;
country would benefit from more efficient resource use, more equalized income distribution,&#13;
and more employment in both the agriculture and industry sectors of the economy. That posi-&#13;
tion also is in line with the findings of Emery (1967), who concluded that economic growth like-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30    Long-run Effects of Fiscal Deficit on Economic Growth in Ghana, 1970­2000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ly would follow export growth. Kravis (1970) also recognized the tendency toward more growth&#13;
in countries that have been more successful exporters.&#13;
   It is apparent from the estimation that the level of foreign direct investment in Ghana over&#13;
the past two years had a positive relationship with growth and was significant at the 1 percent&#13;
level; and that a 1 percent increase in foreign direct investment will lead to a 35 percent increase&#13;
in growth. Moreover, the estimate implies that foreign direct investment in a current year does&#13;
not have any effect on growth, but the investment of the past two years does have a positive ef-&#13;
fect on growth.&#13;
   From the results we see that the coefficient on inflation rate suggests that a unit change in in-&#13;
flation is associated with a 2 percent drop in growth. Inflation is statistically significant at the 1&#13;
percent level. The results also indicate that inflation is negatively related to growth. This implies&#13;
that higher rates of inflation, ensuing from the financing of government deficits through the&#13;
printing of money by the Central Bank, produce a domino effect on monetary growth and sig-&#13;
nificantly influence inflation. This is in line with the findings of Darrat (1985), who suggested&#13;
that both monetary growth and government deficits significantly influence inflation. In addi-&#13;
tion, he concluded that government deficits bear a stronger and more reliable relationship to in-&#13;
flation than monetary growth. Also, Ahking and Miller (1985) concluded that government&#13;
deficits appear to be inflationary.&#13;
   The results of the present study also suggest that the level of money stock in the current year&#13;
is positively related with growth, and that a 1 percent change in the level of money stock will re-&#13;
sult in a 30 percent increase in output growth. This is significant at the 5 percent level. Moreover,&#13;
the level of money stock in the previous year is positively related with growth, and a 1 percent&#13;
change in the level of money stock in the previous year will result in a 45 percent increase in out-&#13;
put growth. Money stock in the previous two years, however, is negatively related to economic&#13;
growth, and a 1 percent change in the level of money stock in the past two years will result in a&#13;
27 percent decrease in output growth.&#13;
   The dummy variable PDUM, introduced to capture the political environment of the econo-&#13;
my, was statistically significant at the I percent level and reported a negative relationship with&#13;
growth over the period. This might result from so many years of the economy being under mil-&#13;
itary regimes. A theoretical investigation suggests that in economies where political power&#13;
changes frequently, each administration is likely to spend a lot when it is in power and thus&#13;
leave a high public debt to its successor (Sachs and Larrain 1993).&#13;
   A 1 percent increase in private investment in the past two years will boost output growth by&#13;
38 percent. The results also indicate that private investment in the previous two years has a pos-&#13;
itive effect on growth and is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. The results also show&#13;
that private investment in a current year does not have any effect on growth, although private&#13;
investment in the past two years does have a positive relationship to growth. Therefore, much&#13;
more private investment would be needed to spark sustainable growth in output, income, and&#13;
employment, but such growth cannot be achieved without an efficient financial sector to in-&#13;
crease the mobility of credit resources to help the private sector survive and be competitive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions and Policy Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
The study attempted to highlight and examine the effects of fiscal deficits on output growth in&#13;
Ghana for the period 1970 to 2000. It is evident that deficit impedes growth in Ghana. Further-&#13;
more, my review of the literature shows that deficits have a negative effect on growth. Results of&#13;
the time-series analysis with particular attention paid to the causal relationship between deficits&#13;
and growth in the context of the Granger causality test show that there is a relationship between&#13;
deficits and output growth.&#13;
   The empirical results, based on the long-run deficit­growth model, suggest that changes in&#13;
deficits, inflation, and the nature of the political environment have negative effects on growth,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                           Bernice Serwah Duodu  31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
whereas exports, the level of money stock, foreign direct investment, and private investment&#13;
have a positive impact on growth.&#13;
   These findings have important policy implications. Understanding the direction of causality&#13;
between the two variables (deficits and growth) is crucial to formulating effective policies. The&#13;
basic idea is that there must be consistency between fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic tar-&#13;
gets. When budgets persistently are overspent, it is most important that the way in which the re-&#13;
sulting deficits are financed (whether through internal or external borrowing or by monetizing)&#13;
brings inflation under control.&#13;
   The largest issue for every economy, including that of Ghana, is to reduce fiscal deficits. Re-&#13;
duction can be achieved either by raising revenues or by decreasing expenditures. But given&#13;
Ghana's large informal sector (with approximately 80.4 percent operating outside the tax net),&#13;
the government must strengthen the ability of revenue mobilization agencies to increase rev-&#13;
enues by widening the tax base rather than by increasing the tax rate.&#13;
   Moreover, government reliance on donor inflows must be shifted to dependence on internal&#13;
resources. This can happen by ensuring that expenditures keep pace with revenues. To achieve&#13;
this, the government needs to monitor the commitments and cash transactions of ministries, de-&#13;
partments, and agencies to ensure that expenditures are within the allocated expenditure ceilings.&#13;
   The policy objective of foreign direct investment in such matters as local content, technolog-&#13;
ical upgrading, and balance of payments stability activities remains important in many devel-&#13;
oping countries, including Ghana. Although foreign direct investment is crucial if there is to be&#13;
any hope of achieving the Millennium Development Goals by the year 2015, there is also a need&#13;
for increased attention to infrastructure, the quality of human capital, institutions, governance,&#13;
the legal framework, communication and information technology, the tax system, and the effi-&#13;
ciency of the banking system.&#13;
   Because private investment plays a crucial role in the economic and social development of&#13;
the national economy, it is incumbent on the government to create an environment that pro-&#13;
motes the growth of private investment in the country. Therefore, with the government making&#13;
efforts to develop an economic environment that will spur business growth, the provision of&#13;
public goods and infrastructure, credit, social services and targeted intervention (such as export&#13;
subsidies) would foster the growth of private investment.&#13;
   Although the resulting growth of the private sector has had a positive effect in the Ghanaian&#13;
economy, much more private investment is needed to spark sustainable growth in output, in-&#13;
come, and employment. An adequate banking system is an essential component of a program to&#13;
increase the mobility of resources. Without efficient banks, no business can operate, much less&#13;
prosper and be competitive. Taxes should be simple, moderate in size, and moderately progres-&#13;
sive; and they should fall more on fixed assets than on outcomes.&#13;

Determinants of Health Status in Kenya&#13;
&#13;
Edward Muchiri Gakunju&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Human health has a major role to play in an economy's development. Healthy populations increase coun-&#13;
tries' productivity. This has been demonstrated by industrial countries that now are benefiting from years&#13;
of investment in health services. Kenya entered the 1970s with a strong macroeconomic base and a strong&#13;
public health sector. As a result, health status improved tremendously, with infant and under-five mor-&#13;
tality rates declining over the next 20 years. This good performance, however, was not sustained after the&#13;
first two decades of independence, as infant and under-five mortality rose in the 1990s because of poor&#13;
economic performance and poor services delivery in the health sector. The emergence of HIV/AIDS in the&#13;
late 1980s and early 1990s contributed to the decline in the delivery of health services, as did the fact that&#13;
public expenditure had long been the main source of funding to the health sector. This study was done to&#13;
analyze the factors that determine health status, using secondary data collected from publications of&#13;
Kenya's Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance and Planning, Central Bureau of Statistics. The re-&#13;
sults indicated that the primary factors determining health status include per capita income, female liter-&#13;
acy levels, government spending in the health sector, immunization coverage, household access to doctors,&#13;
and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Government investment in health facilities was found to be of para-&#13;
mount importance, especially in rural areas where most Kenyans live. Policy recommendations arising&#13;
from the study results include increased government spending on rural health facilities, increased partic-&#13;
ipation of the private sector in the health sector, increased support for immunization campaigns, enhance-&#13;
ment of female education, and greater effort to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. In addition, general im-&#13;
provements in basic welfare and the environment of the community is needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Health care is a basic service in any effort to combat poverty. Often it is subsidized with public&#13;
funds to help achieve that aim (Castro-Leal et al. 2000). In addition, human health has a major&#13;
role to play in an economy's development. A healthy population is necessary for successful in-&#13;
dustrialization; and a sound health care delivery system, good nutrition status, food security,&#13;
and absence of diseases are conditions that produce healthy people capable of participating in a&#13;
country's economic, social, and political development (Kimalu 2001).&#13;
    Health care is both a consumption good and an investment good. As a consumption good,&#13;
health care improves welfare; as an investment commodity, health care enhances the quality of&#13;
human capital by improving productivity and increasing the number of days available for pro-&#13;
ductive activities (Ngugi 1999). There is a direct relationship between the health status of a pop-&#13;
ulation and its productivity, as demonstrated by industrial countries that now are benefiting&#13;
from years of investment in health services. Castro-Leal and colleagues (2000) described anoth-&#13;
er dimension of health care, arguing that it is a normal good. This means households spend on&#13;
health care and use health facilities according to their incomes to improve their health status.&#13;

40    Determinants of Health Status in Kenya&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other principal factors that affect the use of health facilities include service quality, access, and&#13;
direct user charges.&#13;
   According to Owino (1997), the provision of good health satisfies one of the basic human&#13;
needs and contributes significantly to maintaining and enhancing the productivity of the peo-&#13;
ple. Public expenditure on health services therefore is a key investment in human capital and&#13;
plays a catalytic role in the growth of the economy by enabling people to achieve their full po-&#13;
tential and lead productive lives.&#13;
   In recognition of the importance of human health, one of the Kenya government's major&#13;
goals since independence has been to achieve adequate and good-quality health care for all citi-&#13;
zens, as first articulated in "Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965 on African Socialism and Its Appli-&#13;
cation to Planning in Kenya" (GoK 1965).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overview of Kenya's Health Sector&#13;
&#13;
Kenya entered the 1970s with a strong economy exemplifying the excellent macroeconomic per-&#13;
formance of the 1960s. This performance was reflected in high growth of the overall and sectoral&#13;
gross domestic product (GDP) that annually averaged more than 5 percent, a balance of pay-&#13;
ments surplus, minimal external debt burden, and price stability with the inflation rate averag-&#13;
ing less than 4 percent a year (Gesami 1999).&#13;
   The good macroeconomic performance of the Kenyan economy during the period 1960­80&#13;
was attributed to several factors, including high savings and investment ratios, expansion of&#13;
smallholders' production of cash crops, and a favorable external environment. With these factors&#13;
and the resultant "golden" macroeconomic record, the country's health sector experienced&#13;
tremendous growth, especially in its public subsector. This sectoral growth was attributed to the&#13;
high priority accorded to improving the health status of the Kenyans and to the country's social&#13;
economic development. During the first two decades of independence, the sector accounted for 5&#13;
percent of total central government expenditures and 6 percent of the government's total recur-&#13;
rent vote. This sectoral growth was reflected in the phenomenal growth in the number of health&#13;
care facilities and consequent improvement in the population's health status. Different writers&#13;
have suggested several indicators as measures of health status, including infant mortality, under-&#13;
five mortality rate, and life expectancy. Infant mortality, however, is considered the most reliable&#13;
indicator and is the health status measure most commonly used (Filmer and Pritchett 1999).&#13;
   Infant mortality refers to the number of deaths occurring among children under one year of&#13;
age. This indicator is said to reflect the health status of a given population because the survival&#13;
of the infant during the first year of life depends on better nutrition, provision of medical serv-&#13;
ices, and other factors (GoK 1998). In support of infant mortality as a measure of health status,&#13;
Filmer and Pritchett (1999) indicated that, although there are difficulties with measuring infant&#13;
mortality, it is arguably superior to alternative measures of health status. Life expectancy is not&#13;
reliably measured in many countries; and figures reported in the official sources often are not&#13;
based on actual data but are extrapolations from infant mortality and assumed life tables.&#13;
   Table 3.1 shows the growth in the numbers of health facilities and personnel in Kenya be-&#13;
tween 1967 and 2000. As the number of health facilities increased, indicators of health status im-&#13;
proved tremendously. For example, the infant mortality rate declined from 120 deaths to 62&#13;
deaths per 1,000 live births, and the under-five mortality rate dropped from approximately 200&#13;
deaths to 97 deaths per 1,000 live births over the same period (figure 3.1). Overall life expectan-&#13;
cy increased from 40 years in 1965 to 60 years by 1990, and maternal mortality improved. Im-&#13;
munization coverage increased from 30 percent in 1965 to 70 percent in 1993, and the ratios of&#13;
population to doctors and population to facilities showed positive trends (Ngugi 1999; World&#13;
Bank 2001).&#13;
   As figure 3.1 indicates, the remarkable performance of the country's health sector, proxied&#13;
by infant and child mortality, was not sustained after the first two decades of independence.&#13;

&#13;
This was reflected by increasing infant and under-five mortality rates in the 1990s that resulted&#13;
from poor performance and services delivery in the health sector. This poor performance was&#13;
attributed to the harsh prevailing macroeconomic climate and to inappropriate policy respons-&#13;
es to health and health care delivery problems, including inefficiencies and resource scarcities&#13;
(Gesami 1999). The problem was compounded by the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the late 1980s&#13;
and early 1990s.&#13;
           By the start of the millennium, health status in Kenya had worsened. The infant mortality&#13;
rate increased from 74 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1998 to 77 deaths in 2003, and the under-&#13;
five mortality rate rose from 112 per 1,000 to 115 over the same period. In addition, the&#13;
HIV/AIDS pandemic, which has become a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, contin-&#13;
ued to pose a great threat to all sectors of the economy.&#13;
           In general, the underlying factors associated with the decline in Kenya's health status in-&#13;
clude underfunding of the health sector, which has led to lack of drugs, inappropriate staffing&#13;
and staff shortages, and poor maintenance of equipment and facilities resulting in poor or un-&#13;
available services. Furthermore, there are causes outside the health sector, including increased&#13;
levels of poverty. Each year, 1.5 percent of households fall below the poverty line, and health&#13;
care is almost inaccessible to poor and vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of Government Expenditure in the Health Sector&#13;
&#13;
The priority that the government gives to the health sector is reflected in the overall spending in&#13;
the Ministry of Health. In the recent past, the government has increased drastically its allocation&#13;

&#13;
to the health sector, with its expenditure provided through the recurrent and development vote,&#13;
which is further divided into preventive and promotive health, curative health, general admin-&#13;
istration and planning, rural health services, and health training subvotes. Other financiers of&#13;
the sector are the donor community and the private sector, including nongovernmental organi-&#13;
zations. There is disparity in health expenditures, however, between urban and rural areas, de-&#13;
spite the fact that only 20 percent of the population lives in urban areas. In Kenya, for instance,&#13;
the 1997 Welfare Monitoring Survey III (GoK 1997) found that most of the poor households in ru-&#13;
ral areas were 60 minutes from the nearest health facility. In urban areas, the time needed to&#13;
reach health facilities was 10 to 30 minutes. Similarly, the National Development Plan 2000­08&#13;
indicates that, by the year 2000, only 42 percent of the population had access to health facilities&#13;
within 4 kilometers and 75 percent had access within 8 kilometers (GoK 2002). Figure 3.2 shows&#13;
a trend of public expenditure on health in Kenya over the years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Statement of the Problem to Be Studied&#13;
&#13;
Over the years, the public sector has been the main provider of health care services in Kenya.&#13;
However, by the year 2001, the health sector was at crossroads. Health statistics indicated&#13;
tremendous decline in the performances of various health indicators between 1990 and 2001.&#13;
For instance, the infant mortality rate has increased from approximately 51 deaths per 1,000 live&#13;
births in 1992 to 77 per 1,000 in 2001; and the child mortality rate rose from 97 deaths per 1,000&#13;
live births in 1990 to 112 per 1,000 in 2000. Likewise, overall life expectancy declined from about&#13;
60 years to 47 years over the same period. The decline in health statistics indicated Kenya's&#13;
health situation was worsening, despite the gradual increase in public health expenditure&#13;
(shown in figure 3.2). One implication of the decline is that increasing government spending is&#13;
not certain to lead to the expected improvement in health status. In reality, the health status of&#13;
the population in the economy is influenced by a combination of factors that includes govern-&#13;
ment health spending.&#13;
             This scenario in Kenya confirms variations in the determination of health status among dif-&#13;
ferent countries that Filmer and Pritchett (1999) found in their cross-national study of child mor-&#13;
tality and public spending in developing countries. Also, a report by the World Bank (1994) ob-&#13;
served that, beyond public spending, the differences among determinants of health status&#13;
across countries can be explained overwhelmingly by social and economic factors in each coun-&#13;
try. In the wake of declining health status in Kenya between 1990 and 2001, determining what&#13;

diseases (such as HIV/AIDS) and the continued effects of other diseases (such as malaria) put&#13;
the population at a great risk. In view of that, investigation and analysis of factors that deter-&#13;
mine health status will help improve the overall welfare of the population in the economy.&#13;

Research Objective, Scope, and Study Organization&#13;
&#13;
The objective of the study is to analyze the factors that determine health status in Kenya. The&#13;
study focuses on the three decades of independence, from fiscal years 1970/71 to 2000/01. The&#13;
choice of this period is significant in that certain variables before 1970/71 give only an average&#13;
performance, whereas the period 1970/71 to1979/80 is a time of marked improvement in&#13;
health status.&#13;
   The study is divided into five sections. Section one (presented above) described the back-&#13;
ground, the research problem, the objective and the study scope. Section two provides the liter-&#13;
ature review. The study methodology and data analysis are discussed in section three, and the&#13;
study findings are presented in section four. The final section offers my conclusion and policy&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Literature Review&#13;
&#13;
Several researchers have tried to analyze the factors that determine health status and the overall&#13;
impact of public spending on health in developing countries, but their work has not been con-&#13;
clusive because of variations in the outcomes. According to a report by the World Bank (1993),&#13;
neither economic theory nor empirical evidence provides a clear-cut explanation of the effect of&#13;
public spending on an economy's health status. It is generally expected, however, that higher&#13;
public spending will yield better health, all things being equal. Economic theory develops a ra-&#13;
tionale for government provision of goods and services, based on the failure of the market to&#13;
provide public goods, internalize externalities, and cover costs when there are significant&#13;
economies of scale to be internalized (Stiglitz 1993). This rationale justifies the high public&#13;
spending on health care.&#13;
   Filmer and Pritchett (1999) singled out public spending on primary health care and indicat-&#13;
ed that it contributes significantly to health status improvements. They added that the relative-&#13;
ly good health status reported in Costa Rica, Kerala (India), and Sri Lanka is a result of high&#13;
spending on preventive and promotive health care. They argued, however, that although it is&#13;
possible that these economies' good health outcomes result from effective health sector strate-&#13;
gies, it is plausible that they share such nonhealth characteristics as high levels of female educa-&#13;
tion, better nutrition, and more equitable income distribution. The empirical results of Filmer&#13;
and Pritchett's study revealed that 84 percent of child mortality differences are attributable to&#13;
income variations.&#13;
   The specific effect of income on health status, however, is ambiguous. Some studies have ar-&#13;
gued that an increase in income will lead to an improvement in health status, whereas others&#13;
have argued that income is negatively related to health status. Grossman (1972) found that an&#13;
increase in income (through wage increases) might lower health status (that is, reduce health&#13;
capital). He explained this contradiction of his expectation from his theoretical model with the&#13;
observation that people in high-income classes are likely to engage in bad health habits, such as&#13;
cigarette smoking. Contrary to Grossman's argument, however, Heller (1982) found that a&#13;
household's health status improved with increased income as members shifted away from tra-&#13;
ditional to modern health services. Similarly, the World Bank (1994) report indicated that differ-&#13;
ences in income levels across countries are a significant factor in determining health status. In&#13;
addition to income, other contributory factors include female education, access to doctors, and&#13;
access to clean water and sanitation services.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44    Determinants of Health Status in Kenya&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Ogbu and Gallagher (1992) examined the impact of shifting expenditure patterns and levels&#13;
on the process of providing and the delivery of health care in five sub-Saharan African countries&#13;
(Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, and Senegal). Their results indicated that, in ad-&#13;
dition to the level of public spending, the expenditure mix (on salaries, drugs, supplies, and so&#13;
forth), the composition of health infrastructure, community efforts, and the availability of pri-&#13;
vate health care all influence health care delivery. Furthermore, per capita public expenditure&#13;
alone as a determinant of health care was found to be inadequate, especially in cross-sectional&#13;
country comparisons.&#13;
    Per capita gross national product (GNP) also has been found to have a considerable effect on&#13;
health status. Nganda (1994) compared the relationship between GNP per capita and basic health&#13;
status. He found that a 1.00 percent increase in GNP per capita leads to a 1.17 percent decline in&#13;
the under-five mortality rate. He concluded that health status improved with an increase in per&#13;
capita GNP. Related to GNP per capita is a country's income redistribution. Jimenez (1986) noted&#13;
that income redistribution is an effective method of improving health status.&#13;
    In a study on health care financing in Kenya, Gesami (1999) found that fees charged for the&#13;
use of health facilities have a significant effect on the demand for health care. Her results indi-&#13;
cated that the demand for health services fell by approximately 33 percent in government facil-&#13;
ities and by 17 percent in nongovernment facilities after a cost-sharing strategy was implement-&#13;
ed, thus seriously affecting the health status of the people across the country.&#13;
    Manyala (2000) carried out a study on the health effects of per capita income and public ex-&#13;
penditure on social services in Kenya, and he found that per capita income has been influential in&#13;
determining health status there. In a similar study on health care and debt relief in Kenya (Ki-&#13;
malu 2001), individuals' health status was found to improve with an increase in the female liter-&#13;
acy level. Kimalu concluded that an increased female education level leads to improvements in&#13;
nutrition and child health and to a decline in fertility; hence, health status improved. He also&#13;
found that health status was negatively related to income inequality and indebtedness of the&#13;
country. The argument regarding income inequality was that increasing inequality takes away&#13;
income from the majority of the poor and leaves them with less money to spend on health care.&#13;
    A comparative study by Wagstaff (2002) that focused on developing countries found that&#13;
public spending on health care had a larger impact on child mortality among the poor than&#13;
among the nonpoor population. In their study on the effect of foreign aid on public spending,&#13;
however, Feyzioglu, Swaroop, and Zhu (1998) found that public spending in the health sector&#13;
had no impact on reducing infant mortality.&#13;
    In general, as the reviewed literature indicates, variations emerge in factors that influence&#13;
health status in different economies. Although some factors are common, the extent and nature&#13;
of the relationship differs from one economy to another. In other cases, such as income, the di-&#13;
rection of the effect differs among researchers. Using a multivariate regression analysis, this&#13;
study will try to establish the significance of social economic factors in the determination of&#13;
health status from the Kenyan perspective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Methodology&#13;
&#13;
This section highlights the study methodology and how the analysis of data used in the study&#13;
was undertaken. It also presents a brief discussion of the model and estimation techniques.&#13;
    The cross-national analysis discussed in the literature review outlined variations in determi-&#13;
nation of health status. As a result, several models have been developed in an attempt to ana-&#13;
lyze these factors, despite the differences in their approach. For instance, the Grossman (1972)&#13;
model looked at the demand for medical services as both an investment and a consumption ac-&#13;
tivity. The model assumes that individuals maximize individual health over their lifetimes from&#13;
a flow of services of health stock achieved as a result of good health status. Guilkey et al. (1987)&#13;
looked at the relationship between health status and other factors in the Philippines. Adopting&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                             Edward Muchiri Gakunju   45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the model of Guilkey et al., this study analyzes the relationship among GDP per capita, public&#13;
health expenditure, household access to doctors, female literacy level, immunization coverage,&#13;
and access to clean water and sanitation as they affect health status.&#13;
   Using these variables in a constrained utility maximization framework, a multivariate re-&#13;
gression analysis of the aggregate health care model is estimated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                                 Hs = f (pci, g, da, fl, imm, rw, uw, e),                          (3.1)&#13;
&#13;
where Hs is the measure of health status as proxied by infant mortality, pci is income per capita,&#13;
g is the government health expenditure, da is the percentage of household access to a doctor, fl is&#13;
the female literacy level, imm is the overall child immunization coverage, rw is the percentage of&#13;
rural household access to clean water and sanitation, uw is the percentage of urban access to&#13;
clean water and sanitation by households, and e is the error term.&#13;
   The structural estimation equation is expressed in log form to capture the elasticities and to&#13;
take care of any nonlinearities in the relationships. A dummy variable also is included in the&#13;
model to assess the effect of HIV/AIDS prevalence on health status in Kenya. The model there-&#13;
fore is expressed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                lnim = lnpci + lnfl + lnda + lnimm + lnrw + lnuw + lnlg + dummy + e.               (3.2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Estimation Strategy&#13;
&#13;
This section highlights the test statistics on the data used in the estimation of the model. The&#13;
tests carried out are stationarity (unit root) and cointegration tests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   TEST FOR STATIONARITY. This is a test statistic of every variable to determine whether the vari-&#13;
able has a unit root. A time-series is stationary if its mean, variance, and autocovariance are in-&#13;
dependent of time. Nonstationary variables may provide spurious results showing significant&#13;
relationships even if the variables have been generated independently.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS. This is a test statistic carried out to ascertain whether the variables&#13;
have a long-run relationship. Cointegration refers to a linear combination of nonstationary and&#13;
stationary variables. Lack of cointegration implies no long-run relationship.&#13;
   In this study, the Engle-Granger two-step procedure (residual-based test) is used to test for&#13;
cointegration. The test statistic was undertaken as follows: (1) estimating the structural model at&#13;
levels, and (2) testing the residual term for stationarity using the unit root test. If the residual&#13;
term has a unit root or is stationary of order zero (I[0]) , then the series are cointegrated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data Type and Sources&#13;
&#13;
The study uses time-series data collected from government publications in the Ministry of Fi-&#13;
nance and Planning, Central Bureau of Statistics, and the Ministry of Health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Research Findings&#13;
&#13;
In this section, we consider the unit root test results of the variables formulated with the aug-&#13;
mented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. EViews was used as a statistical analysis tool.&#13;
   The unit root tests are based on the null hypothesis of the existence of a unit root. As table 3.2&#13;
indicates, all variables were nonstationary at levels. The ADF test statistics for the variables are&#13;
less than the critical value (­2.9627) at the 5 percent level of significance. This called for differ-&#13;
encing of the variables to remove the trends and wide variations from the mean. After the first&#13;
differencing, the variables became stationary. This change is reflected by the statistics in the&#13;
third column of the table, which shows that the variables' ADF test statistics values are greater&#13;

Table 3.3 shows the regression results of the structural (long-run) model estimated using the ordi-&#13;
nary least squares method. The results in this table indicate that, although the variables have the&#13;
expected signs, not all are significant in determining Kenyan health status, as proxied by infant&#13;
mortality. However, the majority of the variables are significant at either 5 percent or 10 percent.&#13;
The results show that per capita income was highly significant in determining health status. Data&#13;
in the table show that a 0.2 percent increase in per capita income leads to a 1.0 percent reduction in&#13;
infant mortality. This indicates a positive relationship between per capita income and the health of&#13;
the population. These findings concur with those of Manyala (2000) and Nganda (1994). The table&#13;
also shows that the female literacy level significantly determines health status: as the literacy lev-&#13;
el rises, health status improves. These findings are similar to those of Kimalu (2001).&#13;
    Government health expenditure also was found to have the expected sign and significance&#13;
in determining health status. As table 3.4 indicates, a 0.4 percent increase in government expen-&#13;
diture will lead to a 1.0 percent reduction in infant mortality. Immunization coverage was found&#13;
to be significant and to have a negative relationship: a 0.13 percent increase in immunization&#13;
coverage will lead to a 1.00 percent reduction in infant mortality.&#13;
    The emergence of HIV/AIDS was found to be significant as well. The high prevalence of&#13;
HIV/AIDS negatively affects the health status of the population. This has led not only to an in-&#13;
crease in infant mortality but also to increased morbidity in the country.&#13;
    Overall, the model has an R2 of 0.82, implying that the independent variables in the structur-&#13;
al model significantly determine the dependent variable. The independent variable explains 82&#13;
percent of the variations in the dependent variable. The F-statistic is also highly significant,&#13;
strongly rejecting the null hypothesis of zero parameter coefficients. The Durbin-Watson statis-&#13;
tic is also approximately 2, which suggests the absence of a serious problem of autocorrelation.&#13;

water and sanitation; the dummy represents HIV/AIDS and C is the constant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Short-run Model&#13;
&#13;
The short-run model provides a further analysis of the model based on an in-depth specification&#13;
of the variables. Table 3.4 presents the short-run estimation results of the model. From the table&#13;
it is evident that the lagged error correction term is highly significant and negatively related to&#13;
the dependent variable. It has a coefficient of ­0.757910 with the statistic probability value of&#13;
0.0020. This satisfies one of the conditional requirements of a good specific model.&#13;
    The results of the specific model show some similarity with those of the structural model.&#13;
For instance, per capita income and female literacy were found to be highly significant in deter-&#13;
mining health status. The result indicates that a 0.37 percent increase in per capita income leads&#13;
to a 1.00 percent reduction in infant mortality. Similarly, a 1.6 percent increase in female literacy&#13;
level leads to a 1.0 percent reduction in infant mortality. Also similar to the long-run model is&#13;
the government health expenditure, which is significant in determining household health sta-&#13;
tus. However, it was found that government health expenditure also influences health status&#13;
with a lag, implying that the current and past government investment and spending in the&#13;
health sector have significant effect on the health of the population.&#13;
    Other notable factors that influence health status include the immunization coverage. A 0.11&#13;
percent increase in immunization coverage leads to a 1.00 percent reduction in infant mortality.&#13;
This underscores the importance of the Ministry of Health's campaign for immunization to in-&#13;
crease coverage in the country. Also similar to the structural model is HIV/AIDS prevalence,&#13;
which is significant in determining the population's health status. This means that in both the&#13;
structural and specific models, HIV/AIDS prevalence has devastating effects on health status in&#13;
Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Study Limitations&#13;
&#13;
One of the major limitations is that the study uses only the central government health expendi-&#13;
tures to explain health status. In reality, however, there are health-related expenditures under-&#13;
taken by other sectors, such as local governments. As a result of this limitation, the study may&#13;
have used an underestimation of the actual public expenditure in the health sector.&#13;

    Note: SE = standard error. The variables, which are already expressed in log form to capture the elasticities, have&#13;
been differenced to remove the trends. They are defined as follows: D(Lnda) is the percentage of household access to a&#13;
doctor, D(Lnfl) is the female literacy level, D(Lnimm) is the overall child immunization coverage, D(Lnlg) is the govern-&#13;
ment expenditure on health, D(Lnlg[­1]) is the lagged government health expenditure, and D(Lnpci) is income per capi-&#13;
ta; C is the constant, Dummy is the effect of HIV/AIDS on health status, and ECT is the error collection term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The second concern is the possibility of measurement errors in the dependent variable (in-&#13;
fant mortality). Although infant mortality is considered the best measure of health status, there&#13;
are some logistic problems in measuring it. These problems are caused mainly by the many un-&#13;
registered births and deaths, especially in the rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion and Policy Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Several factors have been identified as significant in determining health status in Kenya. These&#13;
include per capita income, female literacy level, government spending in the health sector, im-&#13;
munization coverage, household access to doctors, and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. However,&#13;
the success of these factors in improving health will depend on their integration into a common&#13;
policy framework.&#13;
    In addition, the involvement of other sectors of the economy in achieving good health is im-&#13;
perative. For instance, the education sector is very important in raising female literacy levels.&#13;
The private sector plays a vital role in supplementing funds for providing good health care to&#13;
the citizenry.&#13;
    Further research is needed on the effects and contributions of specific health expenditure&#13;
components to the current health situation in the economy. Such research would entail analyz-&#13;
ing the desegregated health expenditures data in relation to the various health indicators.&#13;
    Because per capita income plays an important role in health status in the Kenyan economy,&#13;
the government policy framework should be geared toward improving per capita income lev-&#13;
els. This is possible by establishing a stable macroeconomic framework, which will encourage&#13;
investment in the economy and thus boost development.&#13;
    As the population increases, government expenditure in the health sector should increase&#13;
proportionately to ease the pressure on health facilities. The government needs to continue in-&#13;
vesting in health facilities. In addition, increased funding for research and development is nec-&#13;
essary. Such support will enhance the capabilities of the medical personnel.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                               Edward Muchiri Gakunju    49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Immunization is a very important contributor to good health because it guards against pos-&#13;
sible infection and disease and thus helps reduce government expenditures in curative health.&#13;
The government needs to step up the immunization coverage to improve the population's cur-&#13;
rent and future health status.&#13;
   The role of the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, faith-based groups, and the&#13;
civil society in providing health care cannot be overemphasized. To support that role, the gov-&#13;
ernment should create an enabling framework by which the private sector will invest in the&#13;
health sector. Furthermore, the government should ensure that poor people are not discriminat-&#13;
ed against in the provision of and their access to health care.&#13;
   Education of girls is of paramount importance in improving the health status of the overall&#13;
population. Efforts to raise the education levels of women should be encouraged, with efforts&#13;
made to subsidize the high cost of education to raise school enrollments, especially among girls.&#13;
   The effect of HIV/AIDS on the economy is enormous. The epidemic not only has led to a&#13;
sharp increase in health expenditures but also has led to increases in the number of orphaned&#13;
children and to high dropout rates among schoolchildren who must care for their siblings. In&#13;
general, the disease has led to an increased burden on the economy. In this regard, increased ef-&#13;
forts against the disease are necessary. A campaign of education and prevention will help re-&#13;
duce the infection rate and, consequently, the effect of the epidemic on the economy.&#13;
   Provision of clean water and sanitation is an important element in ensuring good health in&#13;
Kenya. Environmental surroundings are equally important. To promote a clean environment,&#13;
the government should ensure there is proper disposal of waste products. Indeed, most of the&#13;
current killer diseases, such as malaria, typhoid, and cholera, result from poor hygiene, lack of&#13;
clean water and sanitation, and a dirty environment. The government, together with the private&#13;
sector, should invest more in basic social services to improve the living conditions of the people.&#13;

Responses to Poverty and Risks in Vietnam:&#13;
How Effectively Does the Current Public Safety Net&#13;
Target Vulnerable Populations?&#13;
&#13;
Quynh Ngoc Nguyen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Using household panel data constructed from the Vietnam Living Standards Surveys of 1992­93 and&#13;
1997­98, this report examines the level of risk sharing among households. It also identifies vulnerable&#13;
households and their risk-coping strategies to identify whether the poor are insured against adverse in-&#13;
come risks and how existing public social welfare programs perform in Vietnam. The instrumental vari-&#13;
able results show a good level of risk sharing taking place within very small communities, but income&#13;
risks are not insured on the larger scale. Five findings on the identification of vulnerable households&#13;
emerge: female-headed households are more vulnerable than male-headed households, ethnic-minority&#13;
households are more vulnerable than ethnic-majority ones, households that own agricultural land are less&#13;
vulnerable than households that do not own any land, and households in poor wealth deciles and those lo-&#13;
cated in the Red River Delta area are most vulnerable. The study also identifies the main risk-coping&#13;
strategies adopted by households are self-insurance strategies--selling assets, withdrawing savings, bor-&#13;
rowing from relatives and friends, and using credit. There is evidence that Vietnam's current safety net&#13;
system fails to target the most vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Poverty reduction is one of the most important goals in most developing countries. The World&#13;
Bank (2003) has referred to poverty as a state of deprivation involving multiple dimensions--&#13;
from limited income or limited opportunities to generate income, to a lack of assets to protect&#13;
consumption in difficult times, to vulnerability in the face of adverse shocks, to few possibilities&#13;
for conveying demands and grievances to those who could address them, and to little opportu-&#13;
nity to participate in collective decision making. In eliminating poverty, countries have to cope&#13;
with factors that affect welfare not only to lift out of poverty those who are currently poor, but&#13;
also to prevent those who are currently not poor from falling into poverty.&#13;
   In developing countries, many people often face severe poverty and substantial risks that&#13;
lead to extremely variable incomes. These fluctuations in income can present an acute threat to&#13;
people's livelihoods even if, on average, incomes are high enough to maintain a minimal stan-&#13;
dard of living. Adverse shocks to income can strongly affect particular groups, widening the&#13;
gap between the rich and poor populations and making inequality more severe.&#13;
   Government intervention often is recommended to protect the poor from the consequences&#13;
of economic shocks. In principle, a government-supported safety net can reduce poverty either&#13;
by protecting nonpoor people from becoming poor or by helping people out of poverty (Drèze&#13;

and Sen 1989). Little is known, however, about the performance of existing public transfers as a&#13;
safety net in a developing transition economy, such as that of Vietnam. There is even less infor-&#13;
mation on how adverse shocks to income are insured against through safety net arrangements.&#13;
   Vietnam has a system of centrally determined and mandated poverty and social welfare pro-&#13;
grams implemented by local authorities according to local norms and local poverty standards.&#13;
These are locally financed in large part with scarce resources. Thus, although Vietnam reports&#13;
that its fair share of public spending on transfers might serve the role of a public safety net, there&#13;
is a question whether sufficient central and provincial allocations ever reach the communes.1&#13;
Also, there is some doubt about the performance of the current safety net system because of the&#13;
widening inequality over the period from 1992 to 2002.&#13;
   In light of these concerns, this study asks how adverse shocks to income are insured against,&#13;
and how well existing social welfare programs can target and protect the poor from economic&#13;
shocks in Vietnam. Cox (2002) investigated the effect of adverse shocks to income, showing that&#13;
private interhousehold transfers in Vietnam in the early and late 1990s were large and appar-&#13;
ently responsive to changes in household pretransfer income, and that they rose upon retire-&#13;
ment or widowhood and following a typhoon. However, the study provided no information on&#13;
the sharing level of income risks or how people in Vietnam insure themselves against such risks.&#13;
Studies of the social safety net in Vietnam, using cross-household and cross-commune regres-&#13;
sions of transfer programs' spending, have suggested that more money is spent on the poor in&#13;
richer communes (Van de Walle 2001). Others have noted the lack of cross-commune resource&#13;
redistribution and the consequent disparities between communes in their abilities to provide&#13;
basic services and assistance to the local poor (Litvack 1999). Nevertheless, little is known about&#13;
how to identify poor people for transfer programs, or how much transfer programs have&#13;
achieved in protecting the poor.&#13;
   As a complement to existing studies on the safety net in Vietnam, this study addresses whether&#13;
poor people are insured against adverse risks, and how well the existing public social welfare pro-&#13;
grams contribute to that outcome in Vietnam. Because the desirability of safety net policies de-&#13;
pends on how well preexisting risk-sharing arrangements work, this study examines the level of&#13;
income risks shared among households in Vietnam, across regions and communes. This study&#13;
also identifies vulnerable groups and coping mechanisms to find out if the current social welfare&#13;
programs reach the neediest groups and provide equal accessibility to protect the poor.&#13;
   This study uses panel data methods, deploying instrumental variable (IV) and multivariate&#13;
probit techniques in examining risk sharing and the safety net in Vietnam. A review of the liter-&#13;
ature suggests that this is the first attempt to apply such methods in studying these issues in&#13;
Vietnam.&#13;
   This report begins with an overview of Vietnam's existing social safety net and then discuss-&#13;
es the theoretical background for the analysis. That discussion is followed by descriptions of the&#13;
data and the empirical implications of the theories and results, and by a discussion of the em-&#13;
pirical tests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
The Vietnamese economy has had high and relatively stable average annual growth rates of 7.5&#13;
percent over the period 1995­99. Since the renovation (Doi moi) in 1986, achievements in terms&#13;
of poverty reduction are some of the greatest success stories in economic development. For in-&#13;
stance, 58.1 percent of the population lived in poverty in 1993, but this fell to 37.4 percent in 1998&#13;
and to 28.9 percent in 2002 (World Bank 2003). The question remains, however, will rapid eco-&#13;
nomic growth be enough to eradicate poverty within the next few years?&#13;

&#13;
    Although the pro-poor nature of economic growth in Vietnam over the period 1992­2002&#13;
provides good reason to be optimistic, there are also signs that economic development is be-&#13;
coming less inclusive. Poverty rates and the speed of poverty reduction vary considerably&#13;
across regions and between urban and rural areas. There is also an increasing disparity between&#13;
urban and rural populations, and, among the latter, a worrying situation in terms of ethnic mi-&#13;
norities. For instance, whereas food poverty is almost eliminated in urban areas, it still affects&#13;
more than 40 percent of the population among ethnic minorities and it showed almost no de-&#13;
cline from 1998 to 2002. (Because poverty has such a strong spatial dimension in Vietnam, this&#13;
study develops regional effects and controls for different ethnic groups and wealth levels.)&#13;
    Many households in Vietnam are still vulnerable to falling into poverty when facing adverse&#13;
income shocks. Nguyen (2003) estimated that between 5 and 10 percent of Vietnam's population&#13;
is vulnerable to falling into poverty. In theory, safety net programs have the potential to mitigate&#13;
the adverse impacts of economic shocks. The question is whether safety nets in Vietnam play&#13;
that role in practice. At the same time, the trend toward increased inequality requires a deep re-&#13;
consideration of public expenditure and public investment programs.&#13;
    Vietnam's public safety net covers a broad range of areas, including social protection, hunger&#13;
eradication and poverty reduction, social insurance, health insurance, and employment and un-&#13;
employment services. In principle, this safety net is designed by the government to help social&#13;
beneficiaries, especially those in vulnerable groups, live above minimum living standards. In&#13;
practice, however, programs are often ad hoc, poorly funded, and largely reliant on scarce local&#13;
resources. For example, since 1988, user fees have been introduced for health care services and&#13;
for all but primary schooling, and these have resulted in vastly increased total health and edu-&#13;
cation out-of-pocket spending. Targeted school fee exemptions and compulsory health insur-&#13;
ance schemes were instituted to redress the issues of access by the poor that these new fees have&#13;
produced. But these initiatives give limited relief because fees account for only a small share of&#13;
total school-related expenditures (Behrman and Knowles 1999), and people who are better off&#13;
are found to be the main participants in the health insurance plans (Wagstaff and Nguyen 2002).&#13;
    Initiatives also are carried out to assist solitary elderly people, children in especially difficult&#13;
circumstances, disabled people, victims of natural calamities, and periodically starving people.2&#13;
These assistance programs, however, are centrally mandated but locally implemented, often re-&#13;
lying heavily on scarce local resources. In 1999, for instance, there were nearly 1 million people&#13;
eligible for such assistance, but only 20 percent of them actually received the allowance and 2&#13;
percent were cared for at social institutions (MOLISA 1999).&#13;
    Pensions and other employment-related social insurance payments are provided only to&#13;
workers in the formal sector. Unemployment insurance is not available, so it is extremely diffi-&#13;
cult for those who lose their jobs and have no other income.&#13;
    There is a contingency fund run by the central government to minimize the consequences of&#13;
natural calamities and other emergencies by dispensing disaster relief to regions and households.&#13;
Field studies indicate, however, that emphasis is placed primarily on surviving the emergency,&#13;
and that credit is a common instrument for disaster recovery (Benson 1997; Beckman, Le, and Le&#13;
2002). Because institutional capacity and finances are limited, the aid tends to be short of what&#13;
would be necessary to get households back on their pre-crisis development paths. Poor house-&#13;
holds in particular are prone to further impoverishment as a result (Beckman, Le, and Le 2002).&#13;
    A series of national development programs has been introduced to transfer resources to spe-&#13;
cific groups, covering employment generation, reforestation, school and health fee exemptions,&#13;
microcredit schemes, and physical infrastructure investments. In theory, the determination of&#13;
poverty and need is based on income measurements; in practice, however, identifying benefici-&#13;
aries is based on a more participatory method. To allocate whatever benefits are available, as-&#13;
semblies at the village level debate and sometimes vote on the poverty status of village residents.&#13;

Risk Sharing and the Perfect-Insurance Model&#13;
&#13;
People in developing countries often face shocks on a daily basis. For example, the failure of&#13;
crops or investments (such as death of livestock) that are their main sources of income seriously&#13;
can threaten their living. People also have to cope with adverse movement in the prices of key&#13;
agricultural commodities, unstable employment opportunities, or natural disasters. Accident,&#13;
sickness, or sudden death affecting a household head or family member also may disable a&#13;
household. Macroeconomic instability, high inflation, and underdeveloped legal systems also&#13;
create a significant negative impact on the value of household resources.&#13;
    Under these uncertainties and adverse shocks, households face the problem of how to rec-&#13;
oncile income fluctuation with desirable stable consumption. Theoretically, this problem can be&#13;
investigated as a problem of intertemporal consumption smoothing under a stochastic income&#13;
process. The role of idiosyncratic and aggregate risks in determining the nature of poverty is ex-&#13;
amined in recent microeconomic development literature, which addresses the effectiveness of&#13;
formal and informal household risk insurance mechanisms (Alderman and Paxson 1992; Mor-&#13;
duch 1995; Townsend 1994; Deaton 1997). Risk sharing and its level among households are this&#13;
study's interests in investigating the economic phenomena under uncertainties in a developing&#13;
country such as Vietnam.&#13;
    To investigate the level of risk sharing among households in Vietnam, this study examines&#13;
the full-insurance model,3 following Townsend (1994) and Jalan and Ravallion (1999). The mod-&#13;
el assumes that perfect risk sharing within the group will result in members' individual con-&#13;
sumption being protected from idiosyncratic risk. Consumption still may vary, but the source of&#13;
fluctuation is the aggregate risk that cannot be insured against by risk-pooling mechanisms. The&#13;
implication is that, in a Pareto-efficient allocation of risk in a community (whereby improving&#13;
one household's lot does not imperil that of another), households face only aggregate risk. Idio-&#13;
syncratic income shocks are insured against completely within the community. In other words,&#13;
if a household is completely insured against idiosyncratic shocks within the society, then (after&#13;
controlling for household preference shocks such as taste shifters) change in household con-&#13;
sumption depends only on the growth rate in aggregate shocks. This also predicts that, if con-&#13;
trolling for aggregate shocks, individual consumption should not be affected by idiosyncratic&#13;
income shocks.&#13;
    Many scholars have done tests of perfect insurance among households in developing coun-&#13;
tries, and their tests have yielded different results. Townsend (1994) presented a general equi-&#13;
librium framework, which jointly evaluated all actual institutions of any kind, to test the full-in-&#13;
surance model using data from three poor, high-risk villages in the semiarid tropics of southern&#13;
India. The implication is that all individual consumption is determined by aggregate consump-&#13;
tion, no matter what the date and history of shocks, so individuals' consumption will move to-&#13;
gether. The full-insurance hypothesis was rejected statistically, but it does provide a surprising-&#13;
ly good benchmark. Household consumption co-moves with village average consumption and&#13;
is little influenced by idiosyncratic shocks, controlling for village consumption (that is, for&#13;
village-level risk). Kohara, Ohtake, and Saito (2002) tested the full-insurance hypothesis in&#13;
Japan and found similar results. The full-insurance hypothesis again was rejected statistically,&#13;
but a large fraction of idiosyncratic shocks were insured in markets or other mechanisms.&#13;
    The perfect-insurance model provides two important implications. The first is that if perfect&#13;
insurance exists, then (after controlling for household-specific preference shocks) changes in&#13;
household consumption depend only on changes in aggregate consumption used to capture ag-&#13;
gregate shocks. The second implication--alternatively exclusive from the first--states that, after&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
controlling for household-specific factors and aggregate shocks, household consumption should&#13;
not depend on changes in household income, which is used to capture idiosyncratic shocks.&#13;
    These two implications are followed by two directions of empirical works in estimating the&#13;
theoretical model. A number of studies have estimated the model by regressing the deviation&#13;
from village-mean consumption on income change, or regressing household consumption&#13;
change on change in village-mean consumption as well as household income to show that vil-&#13;
lage-mean consumption and household consumption move together (Hess and Shin 2000;&#13;
Gomes and Michaelides 2003). Others examined the model using an alternative specification in&#13;
which changes in household consumption are regressed on changes in household income (used&#13;
to capture idiosyncratic shocks) and a village dummy (used to capture aggregate shocks) to in-&#13;
vestigate whether consumption is affected by the shock-induced change in income (Jalan and&#13;
Ravallion 1999; Kohara, Ohtake, and Saito 2002; Skoufias 2003).&#13;
    These two directions contribute equally to the literature on the analysis of risk sharing. Us-&#13;
ing aggregate consumption in the first direction in the analysis, however, may overlook the ef-&#13;
fect of idiosyncratic shocks that may affect several households at the same time or shocks that&#13;
are specific for a group of households. Therefore, the co-movement of consumption and aggre-&#13;
gate consumption may not reflect a good level of risk sharing. Instead, a co-movement simply&#13;
may represent an overall bettering or worsening of the whole economy when the country expe-&#13;
riences a good development or a macroeconomic shock. Thus, perfect risk sharing does not im-&#13;
ply that individual consumption should co-move perfectly with aggregate group consumption&#13;
over time. If none of the risks affect the per-period marginal utility function, then perfect insur-&#13;
ance will imply co-movement. But there may be risks that affect marginal utility of consump-&#13;
tion. For example, illness in any period may increase (or reduce) the household's marginal util-&#13;
ity from consumption in that period. In such cases, idiosyncratic variation in consumption will&#13;
remain. Also, this will give biased estimates of the excess sensitivity parameter in a downward&#13;
direction to accept the null hypothesis whenever there is a common aggregate component in&#13;
household-level income changes. This occurs because the variable used contains both idiosyn-&#13;
cratic and aggregate income effects and therefore provides a noisy measure of idiosyncratic in-&#13;
come risk (Ravallion and Chaudhuri 1997).&#13;
    The change in household consumption model is robust to the problem of attenuation bias&#13;
from the aggregate component because this specification allows a separation of aggregate risk&#13;
from idiosyncratic income effects. This approach suffers, however, from the problems of meas-&#13;
urement error and endogeneity in household income. Fortunately, there are econometric tools to&#13;
deal with the problem of measurement error and, in the method chosen, to analyze the Vietnam&#13;
Living Standards Survey data that include detailed household consumption and income.&#13;

Empirical Analysis: Are Vietnam's Poor People Well Insured?&#13;
&#13;
This section first explains the data used for this study and then investigates whether Vietnam's&#13;
public safety net targets the neediest population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data and Descriptive Statistics&#13;
&#13;
The household panel data used in this study are constructed from the 1992­93 and 1997­98 Viet-&#13;
nam Living Standards Surveys. The surveys collected information on household demographic&#13;
structure, education, health, employment, agricultural activities, and food and nonfood expen-&#13;
ditures as well as information on household income from various sources. In selecting the sam-&#13;
ple of households for the study, only households interviewed in both surveys are included. This&#13;
restriction led to a total of 4,300 households (in 150 communes across eight regions) in the analy-&#13;
sis, comprising 3,396 households in rural areas and 904 households in urban areas.&#13;
    The variables used in all regressions in this study are calculated at the household level. The&#13;
main variables are household change in consumption per capita and household change in in-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
come per capita. The measure of consumption expenditure includes cash and imputed in-kind&#13;
spending on food, tobacco, and nonfood items. The income variable includes both cash and im-&#13;
puted values for in-kind income from various sources. Income received as a gift or remittance&#13;
from relatives and money borrowed are not included because these sources of income are likely&#13;
to be the insurance mechanism adopted by households to deal with adverse shocks. Means of&#13;
key variables are reported in table 4.1.&#13;
    To test for systematic interhousehold differences in the extent of insurance, the sample is&#13;
stratified by household wealth per capita. Household wealth comprises physical wealth (in-&#13;
cluding fixed productive assets such as farm equipment and machinery), business assets, hous-&#13;
ing, and durable goods. Land is excluded because a land market is virtually nonexistent; be-&#13;
cause of government regulations, land cannot be bought or sold, so placing a value on land is&#13;
difficult. Households are grouped into three categories by wealth per person: poorest decile&#13;
(0­10 percent), middle decile (11­60 percent), and rich decile (61 percent and above).&#13;
    Variables used to identify shocks experienced by households are based on issues existing in&#13;
the social system regarding health status, unemployment, and occurrence of natural disasters.&#13;
Each member of the household was asked if he or she was unemployed between the two survey&#13;
periods, and was asked to give the number of days that he or she could not carry out normal ac-&#13;
tivity as a result of illness or injury over the four weeks immediately preceding the survey. Then&#13;
the individual responses to these questions were aggregated at the household level. For the nat-&#13;
ural-disaster variable, the household head was asked if the household faced any disaster, in-&#13;
cluding typhoon, flood, or drought, over the preceding 12 months.&#13;
    Variables on coping mechanisms used to examine how households respond to shocks in-&#13;
cluded (1) net private transfer; (2) net debt status; and (3) three dummy variables indicating (a)&#13;
if the household sold assets or withdrew money from savings over the preceding 12 months, (b)&#13;

Quality of the Public Safety Net&#13;
&#13;
The empirical study first examines the preexisting risk-sharing level among households and&#13;
then attempts to identify vulnerable populations. Finally, in determining what types of coping&#13;
strategies are adopted by each population group, this study is able to evaluate whether the safe-&#13;
ty net is an effective mechanism for most vulnerable populations in coping with shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ESTIMATING LEVEL OF RISK SHARING EXPERIENCED AMONG HOUSEHOLDS. The following regres-&#13;
sion is estimated to examine if households share risks in Vietnam:&#13;
&#13;
                               Dcitm=b0+b1Dyitm+dDitm+Xitmg +uitm,                            (4.1)&#13;
&#13;
where citm and yitm are, respectively, consumption per capita and income per capita of household&#13;
i at time t for community m; Xitm is a vector of household characteristics included to capture&#13;
household preference effects; Dtm is a set of binary variables identifying each community sepa-&#13;
rately; and uitm is the error term. Aggregate income risk is captured by the community dummies,&#13;
and idiosyncratic income risk is captured by change in per capita income (which is used instead&#13;
of change in household income because it could capture the effect of idiosyncratic shocks more&#13;
accurately, considering variation in household size). If there is perfect risk sharing within the&#13;
community, after controlling for common community effects, then changes in income should&#13;
have no effect on consumption--that is, b1 = 0 for all of community m.&#13;
    Two sets of community dummies are used for Dtm: one is at commune level and the other is&#13;
at regional level to test for differences in the levels of risk sharing within communes (smaller&#13;
communities) and within regions (larger communities). Household characteristics should be in-&#13;
cluded in the estimation to control for household-specific preference shocks in a consumption&#13;
pattern. Thus, variables included in Xitm are age and age-squared of household head, gender of&#13;
household head, change in household size, and change in total household labor hours (used as&#13;
a proxy for leisure). Change in household size is included in Xitm to present the possibility of&#13;
some economies of scale in a household's production function, as noted by Townsend (1994)&#13;
and Lanjouw and Ravallion (1995).&#13;
    The results of estimating equation (4.1) by ordinary least squares (OLS) are reported in table&#13;
4.2. The statistically significant coefficients of b1 show that consumption is not completely in-&#13;
sured against idiosyncratic income shocks at either the regional level or the commune level.&#13;
However, the higher coefficient at the regional level (0.2) suggests the existence of some partial&#13;
risk-sharing mechanisms at a smaller level of community.&#13;
    The OLS estimates may be biased because of the endogeneity of income and measurement&#13;
error in the income variable. Thus, in estimating this model, change in income per capita, which&#13;
is used to capture idiosyncratic shocks, is treated as endogenous because a household's re-&#13;
sponses to idiosyncratic shocks in income (which are unobserved effects included in the error&#13;
term) may correlate with income. A household may be using some income components for con-&#13;
sumption smoothing. For example, to cope with a crop failure, a household may search for oth-&#13;
er sources of income, such as a job in a nonagriculture sector. Thus, a household faced with a&#13;
negative income shock prompted by crop failure can gain a positive income source from nona-&#13;
griculture wages. This endogeneity in income causes an upward bias to the coefficient in change&#13;
in income per capita. This upward bias, however, works in the opposite direction to the stan-&#13;
dard downward attenuation bias produced by the measurement errors in income variables. The&#13;
net effect cannot be signed in advance, so IVs are used to control for these sources of bias.&#13;

was unemployed between the two surveys, (2) the number of days household members could not&#13;
carry out usual activities because of illness or injury, and (3) a dummy variable indicating that a&#13;
household faced some natural disaster over the preceding 12 months are used as instruments for&#13;
per capita income change. By introducing the direct shocks to income, it is possible to capture the&#13;
actual effect of idiosyncratic shocks on household income. The same instruments can address the&#13;
measurement error in income because these shocks are major sources of income changes, and&#13;
therefore are strongly correlated with income. But by excluding the imputations, the spurious cor-&#13;
relation between consumption and an unobserved income component is avoided.&#13;
    Table 4.2 also reports the results of estimating equation (4.1) using IVs. We still find a higher&#13;
coefficient of b1 at the regional level than at the commune level (consistent with OLS results),&#13;
which suggests a higher level of risk sharing at the smaller scale. In addition, lower insignificant&#13;
results at the commune level (0.082) in IV estimates than in OLS estimates (0.151) show a logical&#13;
direction of reducing bias in OLS estimates. In this case, the positive bias resulting from endo-&#13;
geneity of change in income exceeds the standard attenuation bias. This result expresses a good&#13;
benchmark of risk sharing within small communities having open flows of information. People&#13;
living in the same commune likely have enough information about each other to help the risk-&#13;
sharing mechanisms work well and reduce the problem of hidden private information and&#13;
moral hazard.&#13;
    At a regional level, we find a higher significant coefficient (1.092) in IV estimates than in OLS&#13;
estimates. Estimating equation (4.1) at a regional level using regional dummies may not capture&#13;
the effects of common shocks as closely as commune dummies do, so the attenuation bias may&#13;
exceed the endogenous bias, resulting in a higher coefficient. However, the significant coeffi-&#13;
cient still explains a shortage of risk-pooling mechanisms at a wider scale, such as at the region-&#13;
al or national level.&#13;
    To investigate whether partial insurance and risk sharing exist among households, estima-&#13;
tion of an alternative form of equation (4.1) is implemented:&#13;

&#13;
where y---- is average community income. In a community with perfect risk sharing, it implies&#13;
           itm&#13;
that b1 should be equal to 0 and b2 should represent household marginal propensity to consume.&#13;

If there is no risk sharing at all, it is expected that b1 should represent household marginal&#13;
propensity to consume and b1 = 0. Evidence that the change in average income per capita has&#13;
significant effect on change in household consumption (that is, b2 is different from 0) is consis-&#13;
tent with the hypothesis that some risk sharing is taking place within the community. This sug-&#13;
gests that if partial insurance and risk sharing take place, both b1 and B2 should be statistically&#13;
significantly different from 0, and the extent to which b1 and b2 are different from each other&#13;
would explain the relative level of partial risk sharing within the community.&#13;
    The estimated coefficients of changes in average community income are reported in table 4.3.&#13;
The coefficients are significant at the commune level and insignificant at the regional level. This&#13;
is consistent with the conclusions that there is some risk sharing taking place in smaller com-&#13;
munities and that there is a lack of insurance mechanisms at a higher administrative level,&#13;
which is consistent with the results in table 4.2.&#13;
    Hausman-Wu tests were conducted to test for the endogeneity of changes in income per&#13;
capita and the quality of IVs used. These and the results of the overidentification test, and the&#13;
first-stage statistics of IV estimation and F-statistics are reported in table 4.4. The high value of&#13;
F-statistics (12.59) shows the efficacy of shock variables used as instruments for change in in-&#13;
come per capita.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Identification of Vulnerable Groups&#13;
&#13;
The principal results suggest that there is a lack of preexisting insurance mechanisms to share&#13;
risks, and it is necessary to identify who are most vulnerable to adverse income shocks. To in-&#13;
vestigate if the current insurance mechanisms work equally for households with different char-&#13;
acteristics, the differences in household vulnerability can be evaluated by estimating an amend-&#13;
ed version of equation (4.1):&#13;
&#13;
                     Dcitm=b0+b1Dyitm+gDtm+Xitmg+Aitml+(Aitm*Dyitm)j+uitm,                                           (4.3)&#13;
&#13;
where A is a dummy variable identifying households with specific characteristics. Parameter j&#13;
reflects the extent to which there is higher or lower covariation between income and consump-&#13;
tion changes in the group of households with that specific characteristic, relative to the reference&#13;
group of households without that characteristic.&#13;

    First, equation (4.3) is estimated for each characteristic when A identifies (1) household&#13;
poverty status (according to three wealth deciles as described above), (2) household expendi-&#13;
ture level (five expenditure quintiles), (3) urban or rural household location, (4) location of&#13;
household in one of the eight regions covered by the survey, (5) farm or nonfarm nature of the&#13;
household, (6) presence of children younger than 6 years of age in the household, (7) household&#13;
ownership of agricultural land, (8) female head of household, and (9) household membership in&#13;
a minority ethnic group. These characteristics are treated as time invariant, and the data gath-&#13;
ered in the first survey are used to assign values for A.&#13;
    Table 4.5 includes the results from the estimation of equation (4.3). Households that belong to&#13;
the poorest wealth decile are most vulnerable, and households that belong to a less-rich wealth&#13;
decile are more vulnerable than households in a richer decile. This result indicates that poor peo-&#13;
ple are less well insured, have less access to insurance mechanisms, and bear the brunt of persist-&#13;
ent credit- and risk-market failures. Although the rich decile (61 percent and above) is less vulner-&#13;
able, its statistically significant coefficient still provides evidence of a failure to insure fully.&#13;
    For expenditure quintile groups, surprisingly, households in the richest quintile appear to be&#13;
most vulnerable. This result suggests that even the richest expenditure quintile group is not in-&#13;
sured against adverse income risks and thus may fall easily into a poverty trap. There also are&#13;
statistically significant differences in household vulnerability by region. In particular, house-&#13;
holds in the Red River Delta region are most vulnerable. This may result from the area's high&#13;
density of population and its more frequent incidence of flooding.&#13;
    The results also show that female-headed households are more vulnerable than male-head-&#13;
ed ones, and households belonging to ethnic minority groups are more vulnerable than house-&#13;
holds belonging to ethnic majority groups. Another finding is that households that own agri-&#13;
cultural land are less vulnerable than households that must cultivate rented or cooperatively&#13;
owned land. This suggests the importance of land rights for households. From the total sample,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                                Quynh Ngoc Nguyen        61&#13;

81.83 percent of households have legal use rights of agricultural land and 90.00 percent of&#13;
households in rural areas have use rights of agricultural land. This contributes to the analysis on&#13;
the success of the land reform in Vietnam that has occurred since the early 1990s.&#13;
    There is a concern that the differences in household vulnerability can come from the dis-&#13;
crimination of current household status (that is, a household's private sources in coping with&#13;

shocks). It is also reasonable to suppose that richer households with higher wealth per capita&#13;
have more capacity to insure themselves against idiosyncratic income shocks by using their&#13;
own wealth. This is tested by controlling for the level of household wealth and by including all&#13;
household characteristics at the same time. Thus, A is a set of variables that includes all the&#13;
household characteristics listed above. The results of this regression, reported in table 4.6, are&#13;
consistent with the results from regressing each characteristic separately. The findings indicate a&#13;
significantly negative coefficient for the interactive-term when a household is headed by a male,&#13;
belongs to a majority ethnic group, or has the use right of agricultural land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Estimation of Shocks and Insurance Strategies&#13;
&#13;
We find that households experience a low covariation between change in consumption per capi-&#13;
ta and change in income per capita, which may suggest a level of partial risk sharing taking&#13;
place within the communities. However, this low covariation also may reflect the self-insurance&#13;
strategies adopted by the households rather than risk sharing among households in the com-&#13;
munities. As a consequence of self-insurance activities, households may become less vulnerable&#13;
to risk in the short term when their future vulnerability actually may be increasing.&#13;
   Analyzing adopted coping strategies may indicate if households really have been insured by&#13;
the formal insurance mechanisms of the country's current safety net or if they have adopted&#13;
self-insurance mechanisms. Thus, the results may imply the level to which current safety is ef-&#13;
fective in terms of targeting specific needy groups. In coping with adverse income shocks,&#13;
households can adopt some strategies that are formal or informal or self-insurance mechanisms.&#13;
The strategies (Sit) under investigation include (1) household has support from safety net trans-&#13;

drawing savings or selling an asset; (4) household has positive net private transfer; and (5)&#13;
household member gets a second wage-earning job.&#13;
   To examine if current safety net programs reach the poor, and to identify what kinds of in-&#13;
surance mechanisms are applied in coping with idiosyncratic shocks, the multivariate probit&#13;
method is used to estimate the following:&#13;
&#13;
                                   P(Sit = 1) = G(a0 + a1Zit + Xitg).                            (4.4)&#13;
&#13;
   Shock variables Zit include (1) a dummy variable indicating if a household member is unem-&#13;
ployed between the two surveys, (2) the number of days that household members cannot carry&#13;
out usual activities as a result of illness or injuries, and (3) a dummy variable for the occurrence&#13;
of natural disasters. Again, Xitm is a vector of household characteristics, which include age and&#13;
age-squared of household head, gender of household head, change in household size, and&#13;
change in total household labor hours. The probit method will yield the probability that a&#13;
household adopts one of the strategies in Sit in coping with each kind of shock Zit. In this esti-&#13;
mation, the use of the multivariate probit method is justified by its advantage of allowing for&#13;
correlation between choices because households can adopt different coping mechanisms at the&#13;
same time when facing shocks.&#13;
   Table 4.7 presents the results of the estimation with and without regional dummies. When&#13;
faced with unemployment, the high value and highly significant results on the choice of private&#13;
transfer (0.26 and 0.24 for with and without regional dummies, respectively) show that house-&#13;
holds are more likely to insure themselves by depending on private transfer from relatives and&#13;
friends. Another approach is to sell assets or withdraw savings, even though the coefficient for&#13;
this choice is weakly significant. Households do not have access to a public safety net or do not&#13;
borrow because there is no unemployment insurance.&#13;
   The findings provide interesting implications about a household's responses to shocks when&#13;
we combine them with findings on household vulnerability. Households at a lower wealth lev-&#13;
el are especially vulnerable, but their main coping mechanism is self-insurance, including asset&#13;
sale, savings withdrawal, and private transfers. Such households hardly could protect them-&#13;
selves using these mechanisms, however, because they have limited marketable assets that can&#13;
be sold in response to adverse income shocks. The results also show that households are likely&#13;
to rely on the public safety net to insure their risks only when they face a natural disaster. In oth-&#13;
er words, the current public safety nets give support to households only when natural disaster&#13;
occurs. The small marginal effect of public safety nets (0.0134, as reported in table 4.7), however,&#13;
suggests they are minimally efficient in insuring households against income shocks caused by&#13;
natural disasters.&#13;
   To investigate whether the public safety net fails to target the poor and vulnerable house-&#13;
holds, the probability that vulnerable households (that is, households with one of five charac-&#13;
teristics that identify them as vulnerable) receive support from the public safety net programs&#13;
when faced with shocks is evaluated by interacting those five household characteristics and a&#13;
dummy variable that a household receives support from the social safety net. The multivariate&#13;
probit estimation results on the probability that households get support from a public safety net&#13;
are reported in table 4.8. Findings indicate that female-headed households are less likely than&#13;
other households to get support from safety net programs (the coefficients are 0.40 and 0.49, re-&#13;
spectively, for female-headed households and all households when they face natural disaster).&#13;
Similarly, households that belong to an ethnic minority group, households without the use right&#13;
of agricultural land, households in the poorest wealth group, and those residing in the Red Riv-&#13;
er Delta area also have less access to public safety net programs.&#13;
   These results show a very worrisome situation existing in Vietnam's safety net system. Not&#13;
only does the system have limited resources, but also these scarce resources are poured into&#13;
less-needy groups, thereby making the system even less effective.&#13;

Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
The findings of this study show a good level of risk sharing taking place at the small-communi-&#13;
ty (that is, commune) level in Vietnam, but adverse income shocks are not insured against at a&#13;
regional or national level, thus indicating a shortage of effective national risk-pooling mecha-&#13;
nisms. Even at a commune level, the existence of risk sharing explains only the performance of&#13;
some preexisting self-insurance mechanisms among households with open flows of informa-&#13;
tion, not formal risk-sharing mechanisms. It is reasonable to think that households within a&#13;
commune cannot insure themselves against shocks that hit the whole commune at the same&#13;

time. A household in a commune can be insured when faced with a shock that hits only that&#13;
household, but it seems to be largely exposed to aggregate commune risks.&#13;
    The findings that regional-level risk-sharing mechanisms are lacking suggest that there is no&#13;
mechanism to share risk across communes; that is, communewide shocks are completely unin-&#13;
sured. Therefore, despite the good results of risk sharing at the commune level, risks in Vietnam&#13;
are not shared effectively and households are vulnerable to any kind of income risks that may&#13;
affect a small community.&#13;
    These situations suggest a need for effective formal government-run arrangements to reallo-&#13;
cate and distribute resources across communes or across regions through social welfare programs.&#13;
    Five findings about the identification of vulnerable households emerged from this study: (1)&#13;
female-headed households are more vulnerable than male-headed households; (2) ethnic-mi-&#13;
nority households are more vulnerable than ethnic-majority ones; (3) households that own agri-&#13;
cultural land are less vulnerable than households that do not own any land; (4) poor-income-&#13;
decile households are more vulnerable than households in other wealth deciles; and (5)&#13;
households in Red River Delta regions are most vulnerable, probably because of the more fre-&#13;
quent floods and the high population density. After controlling for a household's wealth level,&#13;
the results still show that female-headed, ethnic-minority, and nonlandowning households are&#13;
most vulnerable.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66    Responses to Poverty and Risks in Vietnam&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The study offers evidence about the strategies that households adopt to cope with risk--&#13;
mainly self-insurance strategies such as selling assets or borrowing from relatives and friends.&#13;
But poor households cannot depend on these self-insurance strategies to insure themselves&#13;
against income shocks because their assets are limited and they may fall much deeper into&#13;
poverty. All households using self-insurance mechanisms, even the richer ones, may be less vul-&#13;
nerable at the moment but more vulnerable in the future. It is much better, therefore, if house-&#13;
holds have other arrangements to insure against risks.&#13;
   The second coping device households use is credit--which suggests that the credit market&#13;
performs well, although there are access obstacles for the poor who have little or no collateral to&#13;
secure credit. Study results also show, however, that households have access to safety net pro-&#13;
grams only when they face natural disasters.&#13;
   The analysis in this report suggests that the government's safety net programs have made&#13;
only negligible contributions to the favorable outcome of poverty reduction experienced in Viet-&#13;
nam over the period 1992­2002 and that the current safety net system fails to target the neediest&#13;
groups. Although public spending is reported to have doubled over the period 1992­98, the&#13;
government should reconsider and reevaluate the effective use of this spending to target poor&#13;
and vulnerable households.&#13;
   The current system suffers from the lack of national norms for consistently identifying the&#13;
poor populations across regions; from the lack of survey and other instruments with which to&#13;
measure and monitor local needs and program performance consistently; and from a lack of re-&#13;
sources and attention to helping households and communities deal with covariate risk. This&#13;
suggests the need for more compensatory mechanisms from the central government that could&#13;
take the form of more money, better incentives for fiscal redistribution at the local level, and&#13;
more monitoring of central norms or administrative constraints on local discretion in the imple-&#13;
mentation of centrally mandated social welfare programs. Also, there is a need to establish an&#13;
insurance system for unemployed people who may become very vulnerable when left with no&#13;
income. From the perspective of a safe society, this problem of unemployment not only puts&#13;
people into poverty, but also creates more crime (which now is increasing in Vietnam).&#13;
   Finally, the market economy arguably has increased the risks faced by households in Viet-&#13;
nam. Income from production and labor supply probably is more variable, whereas local risk-&#13;
sharing arrangements appear to be poor. This situation may lead to costly behavioral responses&#13;
to mitigate and reduce risk. Vietnam may well find it increasingly difficult to sustainably reduce&#13;
poverty in the future without continuous efforts to provide more effective safety nets with ef-&#13;
fective risk-sharing mechanisms.&#13;

Determinants of the Trade Balance in Tanzania,&#13;
1970­2002&#13;

There are three main features that characterize Tanzania's foreign trade: a persistent balance of trade&#13;
deficit, the predominance of primary goods in the export basket and industrial goods in the import basket,&#13;
and the bias toward the "North" in terms of import sourcing and export destination. Most imports are&#13;
from the European Union, South Africa, Japan, North America (the United States), India, Kenya, and the&#13;
United Arab Emirates. The main destinations for Tanzanian exports are almost the same--the European&#13;
Union, India, South Africa, Japan, and Kenya. Tanzania's quest for export development to increase its ca-&#13;
pacity to import and resolve the problem of trade deficits has been a subject of keen interest and concern&#13;
for a long time. Various economic policies and strategies have been pursued since independence, all aimed&#13;
at promoting exports. Those policies and strategies have involved exchange rates, tariff structures, export&#13;
taxation, import control, currency devaluation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, trade liberaliza-&#13;
tion, foreign exchange allocation systems, and the adjustment of policies to meet or adhere to internation-&#13;
al obligations and commitments. The Export Development Strategy initiative and the National Trade Pol-&#13;
icy also were adopted as ways of addressing the constraints against trade expansion. Tanzania has been&#13;
exercising the above trade policy options in line with its international obligations, but the performance of&#13;
the export sector has not been consistent with recommended policies and it has been outstripped by the in-&#13;
crease in imports. Therefore, this study is aimed at identifying the root course of the trade deficit that has&#13;
persisted in Tanzania since the 1970s. Results reveal that the main contributing factors are government&#13;
expenditure, foreign direct investment, and private consumption. This report also addresses the policy in-&#13;
struments used to confront Tanzania's trade deficit problems and suggested alternative policy options.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The growth and development of African economies in general and of Tanzania in particular have&#13;
been influenced significantly by both the external trade environment and domestic policies geared&#13;
toward using the opportunities of trade and responding to trade constraints. The domestic poli-&#13;

cies involved include exchange rates, tariff structures, export taxation, import control, foreign ex-&#13;
change allocation systems, and the adjustment of policies to meet or adhere to international obli-&#13;
gations and commitments. The most important external factors are the prices of primary com-&#13;
modities, which for most economies have to be taken as givens. The application of trade policy&#13;
instruments in Tanzania was guided by the need to stimulate domestic production, promote ex-&#13;
ports, safeguard domestic industry against dumping practices, and protect consumers. Tanzania&#13;
has been exercising its trade policy options in line with its international obligations.&#13;
   Over the decades of independence since 1961, Tanzania has pursued diverse economic poli-&#13;
cies culminating in major changes in trade policy with profound consequences for the expan-&#13;
sion of trade and economic development. The trade regime in Tanzania can be divided into&#13;
three parts. The first part was the pre-Arusha era (1967), which was a liberal period reflecting&#13;
the relationships inherited from the colonial era. The private sector in this trade regime played&#13;
the conventional role of economic agent and engine of growth. Foreign trade flows and relations&#13;
rested on continued increased production of agricultural commodities and raw materials for ex-&#13;
port, largely in unprocessed form.&#13;
   The second trade regime was the one under the Arusha Declaration, which was character-&#13;
ized by government intervention and control. The government adopted the policy of confine-&#13;
ment in 1972 as one of the pillars for implementing the Arusha Declaration. The policy of con-&#13;
finement largely sought to place all major economic activities, comprising foreign and internal&#13;
trade, under the control and management of the public sector. The government was then able to&#13;
intervene in all operational aspects, using policy instruments like administrative resource allo-&#13;
cation, price controls, import quotas, permits, and rationing to control the movement of goods&#13;
and services. Trade policy was based on tariffs and quantitative restrictions, which were imple-&#13;
mented to protect local infant industries against foreign competition and to finance the recur-&#13;
rent budget. Protectionism, however, had an undesirable effect on the performance of local in-&#13;
dustries because most of them were unable to produce efficiently enough to compete in the&#13;
world market. The policy of trade confinement and its implications culminated in, among other&#13;
things, the following problems:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Inefficient resource allocation and inability to mobilize adequate resources as a result of&#13;
       government intervention and controls on monetary policy&#13;
   2. Decline in private sector activity and foreign direct investment (FDI) because of the na-&#13;
       tionalization of foreign and domestic investments and assets.&#13;
&#13;
   Furthermore, the limited internal capacity and the series of oil price shocks exacerbated the&#13;
problem such that the local infant industries, so protected, failed even to meet local demands.&#13;
These developments culminated in the emergence and prevalence of parallel markets in finan-&#13;
cial services and goods, with the larger proportion of transactions taking place in unofficial&#13;
channels and a resultant worsening in the balance of payments and trade deficits. By the mid-&#13;
1980s, the prevalence of controls in a situation of increasing shortages made change in trade pol-&#13;
icy imperative.&#13;
   The third trade regime was trade liberalization and structural adjustment introduced follow-&#13;
ing the failure of earlier restrictive policies to achieve the desired results. The Structural Adjust-&#13;
ment Program was introduced in the early 1980s (fiscal 1982/83­1984/85), following severe&#13;
macroeconomic imbalances that Tanzania had begun to experience--for example, a rising infla-&#13;
tion rate, a falling real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, and widening fiscal and trade&#13;
deficits. Liberalizing trade as an aspect of structural adjustment resulted in a few positive ef-&#13;
fects, such as reducing price distortions, and lowering budget and trade deficits. Structural ad-&#13;
justments, however, produced negative effects, such as a high social cost of unemployment, se-&#13;
vere cuts in public expenditures for social services (particularly education and health care), and&#13;
declines in investment. This economic depression induced a negative course of growth. Other&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                  Mbayani Saruni  71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
measures implemented during this third regime included devaluation of the Tanzania shilling&#13;
(T Sh) and increased producer prices. The overall effect of trade liberalization measures and ex-&#13;
change rate adjustment was to increase economic activity. Nontraditional exports and some an-&#13;
nual export crops, such as cotton and coffee, responded positively to the higher producer prices&#13;
that resulted from devaluation. Official export earnings, however, did not increase significantly,&#13;
partly because of difficulties in marketing agricultural exports and partly because of an increase&#13;
in parallel markets and deteriorating terms of trade.&#13;
    The formal introduction and implementation of the Economic Recovery Program between&#13;
1986 and 1992 helped extend the liberalization initiative to include widespread price decontrol&#13;
and the removal of import restrictions. The program introduced a series of measures designed&#13;
to establish a market economy based on free trade through a gradual introduction of policies&#13;
that complement and facilitate effective functioning of trade policies.&#13;
    By 1996, initiatives in these areas had not achieved the objective of reversing the general&#13;
stagnation of trade flows. At the same time, the process of economic opening entailed a contin-&#13;
uing systematic shift in the theme of trade policy away from the concept of internal trade based&#13;
on a closed economy and toward a competitive system based on a market economy. The forma-&#13;
tion of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the deepening process of globalization have&#13;
added new impetus to the need for building a competitive market economy to withstand com-&#13;
petitive pressures in the domestic market and support more effective participation in regional&#13;
trading arrangements and in the multilateral trading system.&#13;
    There were also other specific measures taken in the late 1990s toward promoting the export&#13;
sector, including regional integration and a review of tariff rates. Privatizing publicly owned en-&#13;
terprises was another move taken by the government, primarily to improve efficiency in do-&#13;
mestic production. The government offered several incentives to investors, including low tariffs&#13;
on imports of raw materials, a low withholding tax rate, and credit facilities from financial insti-&#13;
tutions. High tax rates, however, were charged on the importation of finished goods.&#13;
    Toward the early 2000s, there was a marginal improvement in the performance of exports,&#13;
which indicates a partial recovery in the export sector. It also suggests the beginning of a diver-&#13;
sification process in the structure of exports--from domination by traditional agricultural ex-&#13;
ports to such nontraditional exports as fish, minerals, and a few industrial products. As a result,&#13;
the importance of agricultural commodities to Tanzanian exports overall is diminishing. For in-&#13;
stance, the ratio of agricultural to total exports that averaged 84 percent in 1993 had fallen to 27&#13;
percent in 2002. This has culminated in an increase in the ability of export earnings to finance&#13;
imports from about three months of imports in 1990 to about six months in 2002 (see table 5.1).&#13;
    Tanzania's quest for export development to increase its capacity to import and resolve the&#13;
problem of trade deficits has been a subject of keen interest and concern for a long time. Con-&#13;
straints militating against the improvement of the country's exports in spite of existing poten-&#13;
tials include low production capacity, poor export development and promotion, technology-re-&#13;
lated problems, inadequate physical and economic infrastructure, and the consequences of&#13;
marginalization in the context of globalization. To address the constraints against trade expan-&#13;
sion, Tanzania embarked on a number of reforms, including the Export Development Strategy&#13;
initiative and the National Trade Policy.&#13;
    The Export Development Strategy report of June 1996 recommended strategies for develop-&#13;
ing the capacity to produce for the export market with the creation of market links. The recom-&#13;
mendations included specific action plans in institutional and human capacity development,&#13;
improvement of the legal and regulatory framework, and provision of better infrastructure.&#13;
    To fast-track trade performance, the government adopted the National Trade Policy in 2003.&#13;
Its objective is to enable Tanzania to identify ways and means of navigating a viable and steady&#13;
route toward competitive export-led growth to achieve the country's poverty reduction goal.&#13;
Pursuing this policy conforms with international obligations and regional undertakings. The re-&#13;

forms made in the early 2000s contributed to the increase in exports, but unfortunately imports&#13;
were increasing as well and made the trade balance generally unfavorable (see figure 5.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Statement of the Problem to Be Studied&#13;
&#13;
Despite Tanzania having undertaken macroeconomic reforms and adopted various policies and&#13;
strategies with respect to external trade, performance of the export sector has not been consis-&#13;
tent with recommended policies and has been outstripped by the increase in imports. According&#13;
to the available statistics, Tanzania has never experienced a trade surplus since the 1970s. There&#13;
have been increasing balance of trade deficits, which cause a serious lack of foreign exchange to&#13;
meet the import bill and other payment obligations, such as external debt. This deficit raises&#13;
suspicions that there could be certain policy variables that have led to the deteriorating trends&#13;
of the balance of trade. This study, therefore, tries to test empirically the relationship between&#13;
Tanzania's trade balance and its determinant variables, which are considered to be the root&#13;
causes of the trade deficit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Research Objective, Study Significance, and Scope&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this study is to explore major factors that influenced the trade balance in Tanzania&#13;
from 1970 to 2002. The findings not only will add knowledge to the existing literature, but also will&#13;
be useful to policy makers in formulating relevant policies that benefit the business community&#13;
and the nation as a whole. Furthermore, the findings will give some important insights about&#13;
measures to be taken to improve competitiveness in the world market and hence narrow or re-&#13;
move the trade deficit problems that have prevailed in Tanzania since the early 1970s.&#13;
                               Many reports have defined international trade as involving cross-border movement of&#13;
goods, services, and factors of production such as capital and labor. This study covers only mer-&#13;
chandise trade because it was difficult to get relevant information on trade in services. The peri-&#13;
od covered is from 1970 to 2002, when data on merchandise trade were available. There are&#13;
many and diverse qualitative and quantitative factors that may influence a nation's trade bal-&#13;
ance. For the purpose of this study, variables investigated involved government expenditure,&#13;
household consumption, real exchange rate, foreign direct investment, and income from the rest&#13;

of the world. Trade liberalization was also used as a dummy variable to capture its impact on&#13;
the trade balance before and after 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trade and Economic Overview&#13;
&#13;
Trade is defined as the exchange of goods and services between individuals or corporate entities&#13;
within a country or between nations. Traditionally, international trade has been understood as&#13;
involving only the movement of goods and services across national borders, but it also covers&#13;
cross-border transactions of factors of production. It also has been observed in the past that&#13;
most trade policy has placed emphasis on trade in merchandise, with the role of services large-&#13;
ly confined to the facilitating aspect. The term services covers a wide range of economic activi-&#13;
ties, such as tourism and travel, educational, recreational, financial, and consultancy services.&#13;
The emerging importance of trade in services is the result of increasing appreciation for the con-&#13;
cept of services as a tradable good, apart from its role in assisting economic activity.&#13;
               Three main features characterize Tanzania's foreign trade. Those include a persistent balance of&#13;
trade deficit, the predominance of primary goods in the export basket and industrial goods in the&#13;
import basket, and a bias toward the "North" in terms of import sourcing and export destination.&#13;
Tanzania's trading partners have not changed in a long time. Most imports for the years 1991, 1998,&#13;
and 2002 came from the European Union and Japan. The United States, South Africa, and Kenya&#13;
also were important sources of imports, as were China, India, Thailand, and the United Arab Emi-&#13;
rates. The main destinations for Tanzanian exports in 1991, 1998, and 2002 were the European&#13;
Union and India. Other destinations included South Africa, Japan, and Kenya (see figure 5.2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trends in World Trade and the Place of Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of world trade categorized by major economic areas indicates that the industrial coun-&#13;
tries dominate world trade. Developing countries in total account for less than 30 percent of world&#13;

trade, with the smallest 150 trading countries accounting for less than 15 percent. Over the 20&#13;
years from 1982 to 2002, sub-Saharan Africa's share of world trade (excluding that of South Africa)&#13;
has declined from 5 percent to around 2 percent. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa continue to&#13;
trade in primary commodities, mainly agricultural and mining products. The fundamental cause&#13;
for their poor performance is the failure to share in the increase in trade in manufactured goods.&#13;
The share of these countries in world manufacturing output declined from 0.6 percent in the 1970s&#13;
to 0.3 percent by 1995. The growing importance of trade in services, particularly tourism, offers&#13;
new opportunities to reverse the trend of a declining world trade share for sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trade Performance in Tanzania&#13;
&#13;
The share of Tanzania's exports in world trade has been on the decline. The nation maintained a&#13;
surplus balance of trade up to 1969, but has experienced a widening trade deficit since then. Im-&#13;
port demand increasingly has been financed through external borrowing and assistance. Be-&#13;
tween 1979 and 1995, export earnings were barely adequate to meet a third of imports. Export&#13;
earnings from the three major crops--coffee, cotton, and tobacco--peaked in 1996, following the&#13;
implementation of trade liberalization measures and increases in both volumes and prices,&#13;
among other things. However, starting in 1997, there has been a resumption of the downward&#13;
trend in terms of output volume and earnings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   EXPORTS. The economy of Tanzania depends to a large extent on agriculture, which account-&#13;
ed for about 50 percent of its total GDP and an average of 50 percent of export earnings between&#13;
1982 and 2002. These primary goods, however, face unfavorable terms of trade in the world&#13;
market. In addition to the three crops cited above, the major agricultural exports from Tanzania&#13;
are cashew nuts, sisal, and tea. As Ndulu and Lipumba (1990) put it, Tanzania export growth&#13;
has been predominantly supply constrained. This means that the drop in real export earnings&#13;
can be explained by factors affecting the production of export commodities rather than by a de-&#13;
cline in world market prices. This observation is paramount to understanding Tanzania's export&#13;
performance. In 1993, for instance, agricultural exports accounted for around 84 percent of total&#13;
exports, and they declined to 27 percent in 2002. Industrial exports have been on the rise fol-&#13;
lowing adoption of trade liberalization and the privatization of public enterprises. Exports of&#13;
minerals alone accounted for about 42 percent of total exports in 2002, compared with only 8&#13;
percent in 1993 (see table 5.2 and figure 5.3).&#13;

        IMPORTS. On average, capital goods accounted for 41 percent of the total import bill, intermediate&#13;
goods for 29 percent, and consumer goods for 30 percent between 1986 and 2002. The reasons for the&#13;
dominance of capital goods in the import bills, especially in the 1990s, are the large inflows of FDI,&#13;
particularly to the mining sector, and the implementation of major government projects such as road&#13;
construction. Many industries in Tanzania depend largely on imported raw materials. The economy&#13;
lacks the relevant interindustry links to make industrial productivity more meaningful and prof-&#13;
itable. Big chunks of foreign currency are used for the purchases of those industrial inputs. Produc-&#13;
tion also is characterized by low technological input and high unit cost relative to their rivals abroad.&#13;
As such, many Tanzanian industries find it difficult to compete efficiently in the foreign markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Regional and International Cooperation&#13;
&#13;
As a means to create larger markets and increase trade flow, Tanzania is a member of two re-&#13;
gional groupings--namely, the East African Community (EAC), and the Southern African De-&#13;
velopment Community (SADC). The EAC is a community of three partner-states--Kenya, Tan-&#13;
zania, and Uganda. The EAC aims at strengthening the economic integration of these countries&#13;
on a selective and sensible basis, including facilitation of trade through harmonization of tariffs,&#13;
payments, transport, movement of people, and harmonization of other areas of common inter-&#13;
est. The underlying objectives of the EAC are to foster mutually beneficial trade developments&#13;
and closer socioeconomic and political cooperation. The challenge to Tanzania in the EAC con-&#13;
text is its trade imbalance with Kenya, which is the net exporter among the three partner-states.&#13;
Table 5.3 shows the status of intraregional trade in the EAC.&#13;

&#13;
    Tanzania's participation in the EAC offers immense opportunities for economic growth and de-&#13;
velopment. The country's strength emanates from its vast natural resources, including large areas of&#13;
arable land, mineral deposits, and a strategic position as a littoral state with access to the sea. These&#13;
resources, however, have not been harnessed substantially. Apart from having natural resources, the&#13;
country has been able to sustain a high degree of political stability and peace. These resources and&#13;
advantages accord Tanzania potential opportunities in regional trade arrangements that can be used&#13;
to reduce the trade deficit and reverse trade imbalances with leading trading partners.&#13;
    Tanzania's membership in SADC occurred after the group's establishment in the early 1980s.&#13;
The SADC1 is a community of 13 member-states that recently have ratified the Trade Protocol&#13;
aimed at establishing a free trade area for the liberalization of intra-SADC trade in goods and&#13;
services, and the adoption of relevant trade laws (antidumping, subsidies, countervailing du-&#13;
ties, and safeguard measures).&#13;
    Tanzania also is committed in other bilateral and multilateral arrangements (like those with-&#13;
in the WTO; the African, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States; the African Growth and Op-&#13;
portunity Act; and the European Union). Tanzania, however, has not benefited much from these&#13;
regional and international cooperations as far as exports are concerned. It seems as though Tan-&#13;
zania is a marketplace for goods from other countries, but there is little reciprocity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liberalization and Globalization&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania's economic takeoff, more than ever before, depends on how the country makes use of&#13;
opportunities presented by trade liberalization and globalization. Liberalization has meant a&#13;
gradual lifting of restrictions on trade through removal of nontariff barriers and the reduction of&#13;
tariffs. The main challenge facing Tanzania is how to enhance the competitiveness of domestic&#13;
firms and entrepreneurs because liberalization alone cannot solve this problem.&#13;
    Globalization refers both to the increasing flow of goods, assets, and resources across national&#13;
borders and to the emergence of a complementary set of organizational structures to manage the&#13;
expanding network of international economic activity and transactions. A global economy is one&#13;
where firms and financial institutions operate beyond the confines of national borders. In a global&#13;
economy, goods, factors of production, and financial assets almost flow freely. Globalization en-&#13;
tails the merging of Tanzania's domestic markets into the global market, and the country's major&#13;
challenge is how to participate effectively and gainfully in the emerging global market. Globaliza-&#13;
tion requires dynamic policies and strategies aimed at exploiting inherent opportunities. It is ben-&#13;
eficial in terms of trade development through enhanced access to the world market and the op-&#13;
portunity to convert current comparative advantages into new sources of competitiveness based&#13;
on the free flow of investment resources, factors of production, assets, and information.&#13;
    Although liberalization and globalization present daunting challenges to Tanzania, they also&#13;
provide opportunities for increasing its share in world trade. Both impose constraints that inhibit&#13;
available domestic capacity to compete with the external sector. So far, Tanzania has not been able&#13;
to derive substantive benefits from globalization and trade liberalization because of inadequate&#13;
supply and delivery capacity characterized by low technology, inadequate physical and human&#13;
capital, and underdeveloped infrastructure. The main challenge therefore is to address the con-&#13;
straints limiting Tanzania's meaningful participation and integration into the global economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Literature Review&#13;
&#13;
In carrying out the research on the factors affecting trade balance in Tanzania, I reviewed rele-&#13;
vant empirical studies of related work and theoretical literature to link this study with what has&#13;

&#13;
been documented. Empirical studies reveal how different methodologies and data sets in vari-&#13;
ous environments have been used to yield the results that might be of great importance to this&#13;
study. To understand the trade deficit and the causes of changes in the balance of trade, it is im-&#13;
portant to have a broader view of what has been done in related studies elsewhere.&#13;
   Generally, many researchers agree (and have found empirically) that the variables in ques-&#13;
tion (listed above in the discussion of study scope) have an impact on a country's trade balance.&#13;
The literature suggests that the internal and external factors that influence an economy's trade&#13;
balance vary from country to country and from time to time. As a result, their influences on the&#13;
trade balance also vary significantly. A full account of such factors requires a detailed country&#13;
analysis. It therefore is important to establish an empirical relationship between Tanzania's&#13;
trade balance and its determinants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Methodology&#13;
&#13;
This section of the report covers the methodology used in carrying out this research, including&#13;
discussion of the data types and sources, model specification, explanation of variables, and the&#13;
hypotheses to be tested.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data Types and Sources&#13;
&#13;
This study has relied on secondary time-series data concerning the trade balance (defined as the&#13;
ratio of imports to exports), household consumption expenditure, government expenditure,&#13;
FDI, the real exchange rate (proxied from nominal exchange rates), and income from the rest of&#13;
the world. Secondary data were obtained from various sources. Income from the rest of the&#13;
world was obtained from World Economic Outlook (IMF 2002). FDI data were taken from the 2001&#13;
report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Data on&#13;
household consumption, government expenditure, nominal exchange rates, and the consumer&#13;
price index were derived from International Financial Statistics (IMF 2001) and from Tanzania's&#13;
Economic Survey (United Republic of Tanzania 2002). Producer price index data are from the Or-&#13;
ganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2001). Import and export data&#13;
were derived from various issues of Tanzania's Economic Survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Model Specification&#13;
&#13;
A country's trade balance can be expressed in reduced form as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                                           TB = f(RER, HC, G, Yw, FDI).                       (5.1)&#13;
&#13;
   To run the regression analysis from the above function, Tanzania's trade balance model can&#13;
be expressed as&#13;
&#13;
                    LogTBt = a0 + a1LogRERt + a2LogHCt + a3LogGt + a4LogFDIt +                (5.2)&#13;
                                               a5LogY+a6DMt+Et,&#13;
&#13;
where TBt is the trade balance, taken as the ratio of import to export; RERt is the real exchange&#13;
rate at time t; HCt is household consumption expenditure at time t (including net private invest-&#13;
ment); Gt is government expenditure at time t; FDIt is foreign direct investment at time t, in U.S.&#13;
dollars; Y is aggregated income from the rest of the world, calculated on the basis of Tanzania's&#13;
five major trading partners that account for the largest shares of its trade (India, Japan, Kenya,&#13;
South Africa, and the United States); DMt is the dummy variable capturing the effect of trade&#13;
liberalization undertaken in Tanzania in 1993; and Et is the error term capturing unexplained&#13;
factors in the trade balance.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                      Mbayani Saruni  79&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hypotheses&#13;
&#13;
Based on the stated problem, the study objective, and the literature review, the following hy-&#13;
potheses will be tested:&#13;
&#13;
    1. The real exchange rate positively affects the trade balance.&#13;
    2. Private consumption has a negative impact on the trade balance.&#13;
    3. Government expenditure is negatively related to the trade balance.&#13;
    4. FDI positively affects the trade balance.&#13;
    5. Real income to the rest of the world has a positive impact on the trade balance.&#13;
    6. Trade policy reforms positively affect the trade balance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Explanation of the Variables&#13;
&#13;
Trade balance measures the relationship between a country's exports to the rest of the world and&#13;
its imports from the rest of the world. It is closely linked to financial flows between countries. It&#13;
is the dependent variable in the model.&#13;
    A rise in the real exchange rate (RER) indicates a real depreciation. In such a situation, foreign&#13;
goods become more expensive than domestic goods. This also will lead to an increase in com-&#13;
petitiveness of exports and a shift of resources from sectors that produce nontradables to those&#13;
producing tradable goods. This means that exports will rise relative to imports and hence trade&#13;
balance will improve. A fall in RER (real appreciation) will lead to an increase in the cost of pro-&#13;
duction, thereby depicting a deterioration in the country's degree of international competitive-&#13;
ness (that is, the country produces in a way that is less efficient than it used to be). These expla-&#13;
nations lead us to expect that RER will affect the trade balance positively, but that depends on&#13;
the ability of the country to manipulate the exchange rate, given the level of foreign reserves.&#13;
    One of the causes of the trade deficits is the increase in household consumption. Economic&#13;
growth of a country may result in a significant growth in citizens' standard of living. As a result,&#13;
the country may be able to sustain a very high level of consumption, which has to be met, in&#13;
part, by higher imports if the nation cannot produce enough to meet local demand. In other&#13;
words, if the nation experiences sustained improvement in living standards, this will enable the&#13;
country's businesses and households to consume more; and if the nation cannot produce&#13;
enough to meet local demand, more will be imported--thus widening the trade deficit. In this&#13;
pursuit, household consumption will be a negative function of the trade balance.&#13;
    Government expenditure has the same effect as household consumption, except that govern-&#13;
ment may increase consumption whether the economy is growing or not. The effect is that, if the&#13;
government imports more than it exports--as always has been the case for developing coun-&#13;
tries--then the trade balance will widen. Government expenditures therefore have a negative&#13;
impact on the trade balance.&#13;
    Depending on the extent to which foreign direct investment is concentrated in tradable sectors&#13;
and on the import content of the associated domestic production, the impact of FDI on the trade&#13;
balance may be positive or negative. For a developing nation like Tanzania, most of the capital&#13;
equipment and intermediate products are imported by transnational companies from overseas&#13;
affiliates and they take out foreign exchange in the form of repatriated profits, salary, and inter-&#13;
est on loans. The short-run net effect of FDI on the trade balance under such circumstances most&#13;
likely will be negative because of the production lag. In the long run, however, it is assumed&#13;
that the net effect will be positive because export production from transnational corporations is&#13;
expected to rise.&#13;
    Income from the rest of the world is the total national income at factor cost. It has a positive im-&#13;
pact on the trade balance. The underlying assumption is that when the income of Tanzania's&#13;
trading partners increases, they would "import" more from Tanzania.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80    Determinants of the Trade Balance in Tanzania, 1970­2002&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Dummy variable was used to capture the effect of trade liberalization. Under a situation of im-&#13;
port control, a country may be able to check on the balance of trade. When there is a trade bal-&#13;
ance deficit, the country can reduce imports. However, when the economy is liberalized, there&#13;
are no more restrictions on the volume of imports or exports. The trade balance therefore will&#13;
depend on the volume of exports and imports, which is determined by market forces. It can ei-&#13;
ther be negative or positive, depending on whether the economy has been able to produce effi-&#13;
ciently after liberalization. It will depend also on the efficiency of the government in regulating&#13;
and monitoring trade-related polices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Empirical Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Economic theory requires variables in regression analysis to be stationary. Granger and New-&#13;
bold (1974) have shown that ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators can be inconsistent when&#13;
economic time-series are not stationary and consistent with the assumptions of the linear re-&#13;
gression model (LRM). Although OLS estimation results in high R2 and significant t-statistics,&#13;
inferences based on traditional statistical tests could be misleading. For modeling purposes, I&#13;
tested the stationarity of the time-series before conducting regression analysis. I also tested&#13;
whether the assumptions of the LRM have been violated and corrected them accordingly. After&#13;
all tests and corrections, OLS was run and the results are discussed hereunder.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Diagnostic Tests&#13;
&#13;
A number of diagnostic tests were carried out to clarify and determine the authenticity of the&#13;
data used. Such tests included the tests for autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, stationarity of&#13;
the data, and investigation of the order of integration of each variable using the augmented&#13;
Dickey-Fuller test. The results were found to be satisfactory with minor adjustments. For in-&#13;
stance, I concluded empirically that there is no heteroskedasticity. This means that there is no&#13;
significant relationship between the independent variables, any of their squares, and cross&#13;
terms with the error term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Discussion of the Results&#13;
&#13;
Having completed all the requisite tests and corrections where appropriate, I applied OLS to the&#13;
model to run the regression. The results found are discussed below, first looking at the overall&#13;
observations and then critically analyzing the result of each variable in the model.&#13;
&#13;

The figures in parentheses are the standard errors. R2 = 0.77, F-statistic (6, 26) is 14.59.&#13;
    The general fit of the model was found to be satisfactory with an R2 of 77 percent. This im-&#13;
plies that up to 77 percent of the change in the trade balance in Tanzania is explained adequate-&#13;
ly by changes in the factors captured by the model. The estimated F-value is also high, at 14.59.&#13;
This value is greater than the standard F-statistic, which confirms that the model has some ex-&#13;
planatory power.&#13;

Individual Parameters&#13;
&#13;
The test for individual parameter is carried out as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                                                H0 : aj = 0&#13;

                                                                 26&#13;
&#13;
with tc as the calculated t-statistic, and ts as the standard t-statistic from the standard regression&#13;
tables (see table 5.4). Decision rule is "REJECT Iff" |tc| &gt; ts. This means that the parameter un-&#13;
der consideration is significantly different from zero.&#13;
    According to table 5.4, three variables (household consumption, government expenditure,&#13;
and dummy) are statistically significant in explaining the imbalances of the trade situation in&#13;
Tanzania. The detailed analysis of each variable is given below, with reference to table 5.4.&#13;
    Analyzing the estimated results above, private consumption and government expenditure are&#13;
the main variables that cause the trade deficit. Household consumption is statistically significant at&#13;
5 percent. These results show that a 1.00 percent increase in household consumption will result in a&#13;
0.34 percent worsening of the trade balance. Such a result for Tanzania is correct and is strongly&#13;
supported by the high import content of commodities found on the consumer shelf in Tanzania--&#13;
cars, petroleum products, second-hand clothes, electronic equipment, and so forth. This is true be-&#13;
cause there are very few goods produced locally, compared with local demand. Total demand is&#13;
fulfilled largely by imported consumer goods. Even the few locally produced goods that are avail-&#13;
able don't meet the qualities preferred by local consumers, so there is a lot of substitution of im-&#13;
ported goods for locally produced ones. That substitution continues to worsen the trade balance.&#13;
    Government expenditure, on the other hand, has indicated a positive relationship, but it is&#13;
significant at the 5 percent level. A 1.00 percent increase in government expenditure would lead&#13;
to an improvement of the trade balance by 0.46 percent. According to the theoretical literature of&#13;
Taylor (1993), this result simply means that there have been sensible government interventions,&#13;
such as investment in productive sectors, undertaken to promote exports. The result supports&#13;
government expenditure, but such expenses should really address the underlying challenges,&#13;
such as infrastructure and human resource development. However, there is also a need to reduce&#13;
government expenditure, especially in nonpriority areas (cars and/or military expenditures).&#13;
Note also that reducing government expenditure may not be a sensible solution if it entails re-&#13;
ducing expenditures in such priority sectors as health care, education, agriculture, and the like.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    RER has not indicated the expected sign. However, its effect is insignificant as shown by the&#13;
t-statistic. Contrary to the hypothesis, a 1.00 percent increase in real exchange rate results in a&#13;
0.13 percent worsening of the trade balance. Thus, currency devaluation in a situation of foreign&#13;
currency scarcity and substandard export thus is not a feasible solution for promoting exports.&#13;
Devaluation can work only in developed countries where their exports demand is inelastic&#13;
(Shirvani and Wilbratte 1997). In developing countries like Tanzania, what is more important is&#13;
to improve the quality of exports such that they will compete in the world market not only in&#13;
terms of price, but also in terms of quality. There is a need to improve production technology,&#13;
but devaluation alone cannot enable a country to sell more in the world market, even if the&#13;
products are of low quality. Although the result was unexpected, this reflects the reality about&#13;
the nature of the export product--agricultural crops--which face deteriorating terms of trade.&#13;
    Income to the rest of the world has shown a positive sign, as expected, at the 5 percent level of&#13;
significance. A 1.00 percent increase in the income of the rest of the world will result in a 0.25 per-&#13;
cent improvement in Tanzania's trade balance. This finding suggests that Tanzania needs to im-&#13;
prove productivity and efficiency so as to meet the standards of foreign demand. The impact of&#13;
the change in foreign income on Tanzania's trade balance, however, is insignificant at the 5 per-&#13;
cent level. Going by the reality of the trade relationship between developed and least developed&#13;
countries, this result is particularly true, as was revealed in the 2003 WTO meeting in Mexico. De-&#13;
veloped countries have shown disinterest in the goods from developing countries and are help-&#13;
ing their own local producers (particularly in the agriculture sector) through subsidies so that&#13;
they out-compete agriculture products from least developed countries in terms of price and&#13;
probably quality. There was thus no equity in trade relations under the framework of the WTO&#13;
because developed countries were too defensive and protective in their trade negotiations.&#13;
    FDI has indicated a positive relationship, as hypothesized. A 10.0-unit increase of FDI will&#13;
result in an 0.8-unit improvement in the trade balance. The impact, however, is not very signifi-&#13;
cant because much of the so-called FDI currently in Tanzania is in the form of imported capital&#13;
equipment, and not much has been produced for export so far.&#13;
    Trade liberalization has indicated an unexpected negative sign. However, it is significant at&#13;
the 5 percent level. This means that trade liberalization had played an important role in influ-&#13;
encing the trade balance in Tanzania. The result shows that the deficit is worsened by 0.47 per-&#13;
cent when the country introduces trade liberalization. This result is consistent with the UNC-&#13;
TAD study, which indicated that trade liberalization introduced after a long period of import&#13;
compression often leads to an increase in the demand for foreign goods. By looking at the real&#13;
situation in Tanzania, we see that this assertion is true because there was a strong influx of con-&#13;
sumer goods (second-hand clothes, cars, televisions, radios, and so forth) after trade liberaliza-&#13;
tion in the early 1990s. Importation of capital and intermediate goods also increased following&#13;
the initiative by the Tanzania Investment Center to attract FDI. There is evidence to suggest that&#13;
policy reforms during the 1990s may have attracted the additional influx of private capital, as&#13;
shown by the increase in investments approved by the Investment Center from US$47.3 million&#13;
in 1990 to US$1,024 million by the year 2002. Additionally, the increase in FDI from US$11 mil-&#13;
lion in 1998 to US$472 million in 2002 reinforces the belief that investors responded favorably to&#13;
policy changes that took place during the 1990s.&#13;
    The constant is insignificant at the 5 percent level, which implies that the model had cap-&#13;
tured many of the factors influencing the trade balance. When all variables used in this model&#13;
are zero, there will be a trade deficit of 2.84 units. This is attributed to the fact that Tanzania has&#13;
experienced perpetual trade deficits since the 1970s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion and Policy Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this report has been to present the Tanzanian experience with trade deficits and&#13;
to identify the main contributions of the policy instruments that were used to confront the prob-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                   Mbayani Saruni  83&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lem. In terms of policy instruments used, it should be noted that the instruments have attracted&#13;
more imports (capital inflows), but that domestic capacity to produce for export is inadequate.&#13;
   The report also has aimed at determining the root course of trade deficits that have persisted&#13;
in Tanzania since the 1970s. In the case of Tanzania, I have found that the main contributing fac-&#13;
tors are government expenditure, FDI, and private consumption.&#13;
   Based on the findings of this study, I recommend the following actions to address the trade&#13;
imbalance:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Raise tariffs on imported final goods. This study has revealed that Tanzanians simply are&#13;
       spending more on foreign goods than they are producing, and foreigners are spending&#13;
       less. This condition cannot be sustained. Reducing the trade deficit requires that we re-&#13;
       duce either private or government consumption by discouraging import of certain cate-&#13;
       gories of goods and, at the same time, creating an enabling environment for increasing&#13;
       domestic production.&#13;
   2. Increase savings to finance domestic investment. To reduce the trade deficit, the country must&#13;
       increase the savings needed to finance domestic investment, which would then improve&#13;
       the industrial base. Different ways of doing that, however, would have greatly different&#13;
       effects on the economy. Reducing government spending would reduce the services and&#13;
       transfer payments for education and health care that are available to the citizens. An in-&#13;
       crease in personal taxes would reduce private consumption, saving, and investment. An&#13;
       increase in the tax on business investment would reduce the future growth of real wages&#13;
       and consumption. Therefore, Tanzania should consider the opportunity cost forgone in&#13;
       the choice to be made among these measures.&#13;
   3. Improve domestic production capacity. This study has discovered that most resources (human&#13;
       and material) used by foreign investors are imported, even if they are available locally.&#13;
       This occurs because of the low quality of the available resources and the country's poor in-&#13;
       frastructure, so improving infrastructure and developing the country's human resources is&#13;
       needed to correct this situation. Doing so will enable foreign investors to import fewer re-&#13;
       sources (inputs), so the government will be able to take full advantage of the FDI.&#13;
   4. Properly manage the exchange rate. The intuition of most policy makers is that a rising trade&#13;
       deficit or current account deficit is bad, whereas surpluses are good. This intuition is a&#13;
       poor guide to policy. First, it ignores the distinction between a rising trade balance deficit&#13;
       associated with a stronger currency and rising investment opportunities in the country&#13;
       and a rising trade deficit accompanied by a depreciation of local currency. For strong&#13;
       economies like that of the United States, market forces can operate on their own and pro-&#13;
       duce self-correcting forces that operate on the country's trade balance. For developing&#13;
       countries like Tanzania, such self-correcting mechanisms cannot work. The most appro-&#13;
       priate way to control the Tanzanian trade balance is to combine liberalization with prop-&#13;
       er management of the exchange rate. Such management is considerably more important&#13;
       than import policy for successful exporting and sustained growth. A stable exchange rate&#13;
       would enable producers of tradables to make long-term investment plans. Proper man-&#13;
       agement, however, will require having enough foreign reserves to hedge against ex-&#13;
       change rate fluctuations.&#13;
   5. Select and apply appropriate trade policy instruments. The results show that trade policy (lib-&#13;
       eralization) played a significant role in influencing the trade balance in Tanzania. To ad-&#13;
       dress the problem constraining trade expansion and growth in Tanzania, it is necessary&#13;
       that the choice of suitable policy instruments reflects the most direct relationship between&#13;
       issues involved in the identified constraint and the instruments available. Trade policy&#13;
       implementation has to prioritize the application of instruments to address specific prob-&#13;
       lems on the basis of anticipated direct impact. Effective trade policy also depends on&#13;
       adopting a common direction for different instruments so that these instruments comple-&#13;
       ment rather than contradict each other.&#13;

Suggestions for Further Research&#13;
&#13;
The existing literature has revealed several variables that influence trade balances. I have been&#13;
able to capture some of them in the Tanzanian context, but I could not capture others. Variables&#13;
like terms of trade and capacity to produce for export are very important in explaining the vari-&#13;
ability of the trade balance. Previous studies for a developing economy, for instance, have found&#13;
a negative relationship between trade balance and terms of trade, but a lack of consistent and re-&#13;
liable data on terms of trade kept me from capturing its effect on trade balance. If enough reli-&#13;
able information can be obtained about these variables, integrating them with the other vari-&#13;
ables would be interesting work. Trade in services is another important area that needs further&#13;
research because it is now the booming industry in the majority of least developed countries.&#13;

Adaptability of E-government Policy in Mongolia:&#13;
A Comparative Study with Japan&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Electronic government is the use of information and communications technologies to transform govern-&#13;
ment by making it more accessible, effective, and accountable. The government of Mongolia recognizes the&#13;
importance of e-government in delivering public services to sparse populations living in a vast landlocked&#13;
territory. Without a clear vision and e-strategy, Mongolia may have difficulty identifying how to priori-&#13;
tize its actions. This study examines the adaptability of e-government policy in Mongolia, based on a com-&#13;
parative study with e-government in Japan. This report consists of four key parts. The first part is a sum-&#13;
mary of e-government literature. The second part comprises a review of recent trends in Mongolia's&#13;
development of information and communications technology (ICT) and e-government, and research on&#13;
Japan's ICT sector and e-government. The third part of the study identifies the key challenges facing&#13;
Mongolia's e-government. The fourth part identifies eight general lessons that Japan's e-government ex-&#13;
perience can offer to Mongolia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The government of Mongolia recognizes that information and communications technology&#13;
(ICT) has an important role to play in its development. In 2005, the government has been for-&#13;
mulating an information technology (IT) package law and implementing the e-Mongolia Na-&#13;
tional Program. There is a need to conduct research on ICT policy, especially concerning e-&#13;
government, although it is true that there are limited human and technological resources to&#13;
meet this need. Therefore, my main goal in conducting this research is to support the develop-&#13;
ment of e-government policy in Mongolia. To accomplish this goal, the study reviews the devel-&#13;
opment of the ICT sector and e-government initiatives in Mongolia, and compares them with&#13;
the Japanese situation from 2000.&#13;
   My secondary goal for this study is to conduct case investigations of local-level Japanese e-&#13;
government services in Okayama Prefecture and the city of Yokosuka. The findings I present&#13;
here are founded on a baseline study of the e-Japan strategy, my internship with the Japan In-&#13;
ternational Cooperation Agency, two case studies, and Web-based research. My study helped&#13;

me identify the key challenges Mongolia faces in establishing successful e-government policies,&#13;
and I conclude this report with some policy recommendations for confronting those challenges.&#13;
    The study methodologies I used were (1) a comparative study of ICT strategies and e-&#13;
government in Mongolia and Japan; (2) interviews with Japanese central and local government&#13;
officials concerning the implementation of e-government projects; (3) observation of public&#13;
opinion from thematic discussions, e-forums, seminars, conferences, and various forms of me-&#13;
dia; (4) a study of theoretical literature on ICT strategy and e-government, and (5) discussion&#13;
with decision makers and ICT experts from Japan and Mongolia. In this work, I used policy doc-&#13;
uments, annual reports, research reports, and quantitative and statistical data from the govern-&#13;
ment of Mongolia; the Mongolian Information and Communications Technology Authority&#13;
(ICTA); the National Statistical Office of Mongolia; the World Bank; the Organisation for Eco-&#13;
nomic Co-operation and Development; the Asian Development Bank; the United Nations;&#13;
Japan's Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts, and Telecommunications (now&#13;
the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications); InfoCom Research Inc.; InfoCon Co.,&#13;
Ltd.; and several Japanese research institutions.&#13;

E-government Literature Review&#13;
&#13;
This section of the report briefly introduces the concept of e-government and discusses its status&#13;
in the Asia-Pacific region, beginning in 2000.&#13;
    In the past six years, many governments have recognized that ICT can help improve the de-&#13;
velopment of their public sector. ICT has provided them with the capacity to make improve-&#13;
ments via e-government (OECD 2003). The governments in the Asia-Pacific region are in the ini-&#13;
tial phases of adopting ICT to improve financial management and reporting of information,&#13;
streamline the delivery of government services, enhance communication with their citizenry,&#13;
and serve as a catalyst for empowering citizens to interact with the government (Wescott 2001).&#13;
It is important to note, however, that Rosenau (2000) has argued that the adaptive challenges of&#13;
governance go far beyond technology per se--they call for new organizational structures and&#13;
skills, new forms of leadership, and perhaps even a redefinition of purpose. They also call for a&#13;
significant broadening and transformation of public-private sector partnerships and the rela-&#13;
tional dynamics that underpin them.1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Definitions of E-government&#13;
&#13;
There are many definitions of e-government and the term itself is not universally used. The differ-&#13;
ences are not merely semantic and they may reflect priorities in government strategies (OECD&#13;
2003). Box 6.1 provides the principal definitions of e-government that appear in the literature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E-government in the Asia-Pacific Region&#13;
&#13;
The use of modern information and communications networks in governmental organizations&#13;
and in private households around the world has a short history; and its long-term effects on pol-&#13;
itics, economics, and society cannot be determined. In business, however, ICT has a long and in-&#13;
tensive history of use, so its economic relevance can be measured now (Meyer and Wilhelm&#13;
2002). The public sector has begun to recognize the potential opportunities offered by ICT and&#13;
models of e-business to fit with citizens' demands, to offer better citizen services, and to increase&#13;
government efficiency by streamlining internal processes (Ndou 2004). Governments world-&#13;
wide made rapid progress in embracing ICT for e-government in the period from 2000 to 2006.&#13;
The 2004 e-government readiness survey conducted by the United Nations (UN) assessed more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    1. The new dynamics are very far from traditional public sector procurement and contracting processes.&#13;

than 50,000 features of e-government Web sites in the 191 UN member-states to ascertain how&#13;
willing and ready are governments around the world to employ the opportunities offered by&#13;
ICT to improve their citizens' access to and quality of basic social services for sustainable hu-&#13;
man development (UN 2004). Because they have a higher level of per capita income, human de-&#13;
velopment, and basic infrastructure than do some other developing regions, most of the coun-&#13;
tries of South and Eastern Asia reported steady progress in 2004 and a readiness index for the&#13;
region that is higher than the world average (see table 6.1).&#13;
    Data presented in the table show that the Republic of Korea was the regional leader (0.858),&#13;
followed by Singapore (0.834) and Japan (0.726). These countries improved upon or maintained&#13;
their relative positions in the global readiness rankings in 2004. Korea improved by 8 points,&#13;
Singapore by 4, and Japan maintained the same relative position it held in 2003. Among other&#13;
notable gainers were Thailand (+6) and China (+7). Even though its e-government offerings are&#13;
still being developed, the greatest gain in rank was posted by Mongolia, which advanced 28&#13;
places--from 103rd in 2003 to 75th in 2004.&#13;

92    Adaptability of E-government Policy in Mongolia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Overview of ICT Development in Mongolia&#13;
&#13;
This section of the report briefly reviews policy and regulatory issues, ICT strategy, and elec-&#13;
tronic government in Mongolia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy and Regulatory Issues&#13;
&#13;
Mongolia's parliament revised and passed the Communications Law in November 2001. Under&#13;
this law, the government established the Communications Regulatory Commission, which is re-&#13;
sponsible for issuing licenses, regulating and interconnecting tariffs, monitoring service quality,&#13;
and numbering and regulating radio frequency (for additional information, see http://ww&#13;
w.crc.gov.mn). In October 2004, the government established the Information and Communica-&#13;
tions Technology Authority by joining the former ICT department of the Ministry of Infrastruc-&#13;
ture with the Post and Telecom Agency. According to the Government Action Plan for 2004­08,&#13;
the ICTA, organized under Mongolia's Office of the Prime Minister, has three major tasks: (1)&#13;
developing ICT laws, (2) implementing the e-Mongolia program (described below), and (3) de-&#13;
veloping an e-government master plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ICT Strategy&#13;
&#13;
In February 2000, Mongolia's parliament passed a policy document titled "Vision 2010 for the ICT&#13;
Sector of Mongolia." The mission of this document is "to build a community based on knowledge&#13;
and intellectual capacity to improve the living standards of the people" (GoM 2003, p. 101). The&#13;
main strategies for accomplishing that mission are outlined in "Vision 2010," which aims to pro-&#13;
vide favorable conditions for the development of government-legislation, business-economic, and&#13;
people-society frameworks.&#13;
    The government approved the medium-term strategy (2003­05) for developing the ICT sec-&#13;
tor and an action plan for its implementation in January 2003. This strategy identifies harness-&#13;
ing the potential of ICT as a key development tool, and it is supported by these four pillars: (1)&#13;
establishing the appropriate regulatory framework, (2) developing information infrastructure,&#13;
(3) establishing a business framework, and (4) developing human resources.&#13;
    In October 2005, Mongolia's government adopted the e-Mongolia National Program. The&#13;
document formulates the midterm (2005­12) sector policy and presents a road map for imple-&#13;
menting ICT. The e-Mongolia National Program, based on the concept of using ICT to improve&#13;
the welfare of the people of Mongolia, covers the use of this technology in government, educa-&#13;
tion, health, and commerce subprograms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E-government in Mongolia&#13;
&#13;
In 2005, the ICTA developed an e-government master plan, which incorporates the belief that the&#13;
most effective e-government strategy involves depending on input from a variety of stakeholders.&#13;
Increasingly, government employees, businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and citizens&#13;
are brought into the process of defining e-government strategies. The master plan is intended to&#13;
develop national competitiveness and enhance quality of public services by establishing an effec-&#13;
tive, systematic, and productive e-government. Figure 6.1 shows that Mongolia envisions its e-&#13;
government producing economic development; administration efficiency; and improvements in&#13;
government-to-citizen, government-to-business, and government-to-government services. These&#13;
objectives can be achieved by providing civil servants with ICT education, establishing ICT laws,&#13;
and securing the sponsorship of high-ranking civil servants who execute the e-government strate-&#13;
gy and tactics. The 22 projects of the e-government master plan generally address the digitization&#13;
of government information and procedures and the provision of selected information resources&#13;
and public services via the Internet.&#13;

    The present study points out that the existing master plan addresses only central govern-&#13;
ment issues. In the future, more intensive actions should be undertaken to develop local e-&#13;
government, which would offer a good opportunity to hear local citizens' voices, promote cit-&#13;
izen participation, and bridge the digital divide. Local e-government could be used to address&#13;
common issues at the community level--issues such as poverty reduction, health and educa-&#13;
tion services, environmental problems, and land management.&#13;

Overview of ICT Development in Japan&#13;
&#13;
This section briefly reviews policy and regulatory issues, ICT strategy, and e-government in&#13;
Japan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policy and Regulatory Issues&#13;
&#13;
The telecommunications business began in Japan in December 1869 when public telegraph serv-&#13;
ices opened between Tokyo and Yokohama. In December 1890, telephone exchanges opened in&#13;
Tokyo and Yokohama, and switching began between the two cities. Thereafter, under state con-&#13;
trol, telegraph and telephone services evolved into the complex industry they are today (Akat-&#13;
suka and Yoshida 1999). Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications carried out a&#13;
partial revision of the Telecommunications Business Law and the Law Concerning Nippon Tele-&#13;
graph and Telephone Corporation (Ministry of Public Management 2004). The revised laws,&#13;
which took effect in April 2004, promote deregulation so that private carriers can demonstrate&#13;
their capabilities fully, ensure the minimum safety net required by society, and seek to make the&#13;
entire system more convenient for users in Japan.&#13;
    During the year 2000, considerable progress was made in devising policies aimed at promot-&#13;
ing information technology. The IT Charter, adopted at the G-8 Summit in Okinawa in July 2000,&#13;
focused on the issues concerning the digital divide and stipulated the need for policies designed&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94     Adaptability of E-government Policy in Mongolia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to rectify that problem.2 Prior to the opening of the summit, Japan had established a govern-&#13;
ment-sponsored promotion system and pounded out plans and measures for a national IT strat-&#13;
egy (JIPDEC 2001).&#13;
    In November 2000, the Basic Law on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Communi-&#13;
cations Network Society (IT Basic Law) was passed by the Diet, Japan's parliament, and it took effect&#13;
in January 2001. The Strategic Headquarters for the Promotion of an Advanced Information and&#13;
Telecommunications Network Society (ITSH) has been set up within the cabinet in accordance with&#13;
the IT Basic Law. In principle, the private sector will take the lead in forming a knowledge-emergent&#13;
society,3 and the state and local governments will implement measures to create an environment&#13;
where the private sector can exert its full potential (Article 7 of the IT Basic Law).&#13;
    In 2001 and 2003, respectively, the ITSH developed the e-Japan strategy I and strategy II,&#13;
aimed at making Japan the most advanced IT nation in the world. These strategies will be dis-&#13;
cussed in more detail in the following section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E-Japan Strategy I and Strategy II&#13;
&#13;
The government of Japan developed the nationally targeted e-Japan strategy to create an infor-&#13;
mation society. The first e-Japan strategy envisioned Japan as the world's leading ICT nation by&#13;
the year 2005 (Ministry of Public Management 2004). The program defined the roles of the pri-&#13;
vate and public sectors so that the private sector would take the lead in the area of IT. The cen-&#13;
tral government ran priority policy programs in 2001 and 2002 under e-Japan strategy I. The&#13;
most significant achievement of the first strategy has been the development of ICT infrastruc-&#13;
ture, particularly the drastic growth of broadband access, especially asymmetric digital sub-&#13;
scriber line (ADSL) technology. Figure 6.2 shows that the total number of subscribers was 14.95&#13;
million in December 2003. In particular, there were 11.20 million ADSL subscribers, an increase&#13;
of approximately 1.5 times over the number of subscribers in the previous year (Ministry of&#13;
Public Management 2004, p. 6).&#13;
    In view of those numbers, the government decided that most of the goals of the first ICT&#13;
strategy had been achieved. Therefore, it moved ahead to the second phase of the strategy&#13;
(ITSH 2003). Introduced by the ITSH in July 2003, e-Japan strategy II aims to ensure that Japan&#13;
maintains its position as the world's IT leader from 2006 onward. In this second stage, Japan&#13;
will begin to use infrastructure established during the first phase to actively transform e-tools&#13;
for Japanese public, social, and economic systems (Ministry of Public Management 2004). Strat-&#13;
egy II proposes to take leading measures in seven important areas that are closely related to the&#13;
lives of the Japanese people. The areas are medical treatment, food, life, finance for small and&#13;
medium-size enterprise, knowledge, employment, and government service. The strategy also&#13;
seeks to advance the development of new IT social infrastructures during the second phase.&#13;
    In 2004, the e-Japan strategy budget related to e-government and to the formation of an ad-&#13;
vanced information and communications network society reached 830.8 billion yen and 1,548.1&#13;
billion yen, respectively. These amounts are increases of 255.3 billion yen and 12.6 billion yen&#13;
over the figures of the previous fiscal year, respectively (Ministry of Public Management 2004).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E-government in Japan&#13;
&#13;
The e-government efforts will enable all citizens and companies to access public services&#13;
without being restricted by time or location, thus making business activities more pleasant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    2. The IT Charter is available at http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2000/charter.html.&#13;
    3. Through the e-Japan strategy, the government will create a "knowledge-emergent society" that fos-&#13;
ters creativity to exchange knowledge among citizens. See e-Japan strategy's vision of the ideal IT society&#13;
(ITSH 2001).&#13;

and convenient. They also will enhance the efficiency and transparency of administrative&#13;
management.&#13;
   The Kasumigaseki wide-area network (KWAN) is the government network connected to all&#13;
ministries' local-area networks. KWAN started in January 1997 to promote information sharing&#13;
and electronic filing using technologies for access control and security (Yasunaka 2003).&#13;
   The Japanese e-government portal was launched in April 2001, and it is expected to be a one-&#13;
stop access gateway for online services. It comprises a search function for information from all&#13;
ministries, a database of government information (such as laws and geographic data), links to&#13;
local and central government Web sites, and so forth. Most of the contents are available only in&#13;
the Japanese language. Compared with "e-gov" portals in other countries, the Japanese portal&#13;
lags far behind in citizen satisfaction and usability (Muta 2004).&#13;
   All national administrative procedures (approximately 52,000 of them), including applica-&#13;
tions and notifications by people and companies, had been made accessible 24 hours a day from&#13;
home or office computers via the Internet by the end of fiscal 2003. The local government wide-&#13;
area network (LGWAN) will be connected to all local governments, prefectures, cities, and oth-&#13;
er municipalities by the local government public key infrastructure, and will cover all the local&#13;
governments. Development of an environment for performing administrative functions online&#13;
is essentially complete, including the Basic Resident Registers Network System (Jyuki Net) that&#13;
became fully operational in August 2003, the start of a public personal certification system that&#13;
operates online, and electronic payment services for taxes and various administrative fees that&#13;
began operating in January 2004 (Ministry of Public Management 2004).&#13;
   As the moves toward e-government become more specific in the future, the relationship be-&#13;
tween the residents and the administration likely will become closer. At some point in the fu-&#13;
ture, the Japanese term yaku-sho (public office) may move closer to the expression yaku-ni-tatsu&#13;
(useful), signifying the shift from "officious" to "useful" in the public's perception of govern-&#13;
ment functions and of the ability to access such functions through the Internet. Steps are being&#13;

   CASE STUDY A: YOKOSUKA ONLINE TENDER SYSTEM. Yokosuka is a city of green hills surround-&#13;
ed by the brilliant blue sea; it is situated in the central area of the Miura Peninsula in southeast-&#13;
ern Kanagawa Prefecture and is bordered by Tokyo Bay to the east and Sagami Bay to the west.&#13;
The population of Yokosuka reached 430,000 in 2004. Since 1996, Yokosuka has come under the&#13;
international and domestic spotlight for its use of ICT in its efforts to complete the basic foun-&#13;
dations for local e-government city management and citizen services. The latest ICT research is&#13;
being conducted at the Yokosuka Research Park.5&#13;
   Realizing the need to save labor by digitizing the bidding process, the city implemented an&#13;
electronic bidding system in September 2001. All processes take place via the Internet--submis-&#13;
sion of bidding applications, certification of companies wishing to bid, the actual bidding, and&#13;
announcement of results.&#13;
   This electronic system has had a large financial effect. All bids submitted by all competitors&#13;
are opened online to ensure the transparency of the procedure and eliminate injustice. The open&#13;
process promotes competition and lowers the contracting price. Bidders save time and money&#13;
because they no longer have to visit the city procurement office in person at least once during&#13;
the bidding. In 1997, before this reform took place, the average number of participating traders&#13;
was 9. In 2002, the total number of traders reached 22.&#13;
   Yokosuka has been able to normalize bidding by improving its bidding system and proce-&#13;
dures. This does not mean, however, that normalization can be achieved in the same way by all&#13;
local governments. The measures that need to be taken will differ according to the size of a city's&#13;
population. Furthermore, electronic bidding can change the established concept of participating&#13;
in public bids because it removes geographical restrictions and enables tenders to be submitted&#13;
from anywhere in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   CASE STUDY B: OKAYAMA INFORMATION HIGHWAY. The Okayama Prefecture is located at the&#13;
heart of the Chugoku-Shikoku region. Its population reached 1.95 million in 2001. The prefec-&#13;
ture comprises 7,111 square kilometers of land. In April 1996, the Okayama Prefecture launched&#13;
an information network for reducing regional disparities. The prefecture government office&#13;
transferred operation and maintenance of the network to a private company. This transfer&#13;
serves as a good example for engaging the private sector in reducing development and mainte-&#13;
nance costs, providing services for residents and labor-saving processes for business, and offer-&#13;
ing solutions to counter the lack of human resources. Such a public-private partnership can free&#13;
the prefecture government office to focus on core policies of IT use in the prefecture.&#13;
   Moreover, the prefecture plans to promote further ICT to improve the Okayama information&#13;
highway. Okayama Research Park Incubation Center, funded by the prefecture and launched in&#13;
April 2003, is the first business incubation facility run under the Private Finance Initiative&#13;
scheme in Japan.6&#13;
   Another good example of government enabled by electronics is the Niimi e-voting system. The&#13;
city of Niimi in Okayama Prefecture implemented electronic voting on touch-screen machines in&#13;
June 2002. The system was designed to facilitate the quick counting of votes and to reflect accu-&#13;
rately the will of the people by reducing the number of spoiled and invalid ballots (InfoCom 2003).&#13;
In approximately 25 minutes, more than 15,000 voters from 43 polling stations voted via a touch-&#13;
screen system. Officials reported that the electronic voting went smoothly, except for an initial ma-&#13;
chine problem that delayed the issuing of voting cards to 15 people (Benoit 2004).&#13;
   Some 100 local municipalities observed Niimi's experiment with electronic voting, and sev-&#13;
eral municipalities are preparing to adopt e-voting in the near future. This will bring elections&#13;

closer to people and, as a result, will change the way that democracy is perceived and practiced&#13;
in Japan (InfoCom 2003).&#13;
    The Okayama information highway project is succeeding because of public-private sector&#13;
partnership cooperation. Internet access in Okayama Prefecture today is among the best in&#13;
Japan. The government now needs to promote more active use of the infrastructure by making&#13;
Internet use a part of everyday life for all its citizens, whether they do or do not own personal&#13;
computers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key E-government Challenges in Mongolia&#13;
&#13;
The key e-government challenges facing Mongolia are strategy development, leadership, hu-&#13;
man resource development, management change, the digital divide, technological change, pub-&#13;
lic-private partnerships, and citizen participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategy Development&#13;
&#13;
Information and communications technology has become the core development issue in most&#13;
developing countries in Asia. In Mongolia, landlocked and sparsely populated across a vast&#13;
landscape, ICT is an extremely important development factor in overcoming these challenges. It&#13;
is necessary to extend ICT to all sectors of society to develop knowledge-based industry and es-&#13;
tablish an information society (ICTA 2004).&#13;
    In October 2005, the government of Mongolia adopted the e-Mongolia National Program,&#13;
which formulated the midterm (2005­12) sector policy and the ICT implementation road map. The&#13;
e-Mongolia National Program is based on the idea of using ICT to improve the welfare of the peo-&#13;
ple of Mongolia, and it covers e-government, e-learning, e-health, and e-commerce subprograms.&#13;
    In 2005, the Information and Communications Technology Authority implemented the&#13;
e-government master plan. I believe that the most effective e-government strategy is to depend&#13;
on input from a variety of stakeholders. Increasingly, government employees, businesses, non-&#13;
governmental organizations, and private citizens are brought into the process of defining e-&#13;
government strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Leadership&#13;
&#13;
A major challenge for the government of Mongolia during the transition period has been to re-&#13;
form its institutional structure in such a way that both the government and the public sector are&#13;
able to provide the necessary leadership and management for the conduct of public affairs.&#13;
Mongolia inherited large bureaucratic machinery from the previous command system of public&#13;
administration, as well as entrenched, obstructive, bureaucratic attitudes and behavior within&#13;
the civil service (UNU 2002).&#13;
    A national seminar on ICT, organized in February 2001, resulted in the formation of a Na-&#13;
tional ICT Committee headed by the prime minister of Mongolia. This committee comprised&#13;
representatives from government, civil societies, academic organizations, and the private sector.&#13;
    In 2004, the government established ICTA under the aegis of the prime minister. The author-&#13;
ity is responsible for overall policy formulation, planning, implementation, and coordination of&#13;
all ICT-related issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Human Resource Development&#13;
&#13;
Human development issues were not addressed adequately during Mongolia's decade-long&#13;
transition to an open economy and a democratic political system. Skilled managers and tech-&#13;
nologists are in short supply. Since 1990, the tertiary education sector has led to a large increase&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in the number of graduates. But many of them have no practical skills. In an employer survey&#13;
carried out in 2001, 48 percent of organization respondents said that high school graduates&#13;
lacked an interest in business, and 24 percent said that graduates of higher education had poor&#13;
levels of technical knowledge. Therefore, the government considers one of the essential tasks for&#13;
Mongolians at the beginning of the 21st century is to become universally computer literate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Management Change&#13;
&#13;
Many scholars argue that organizational culture is the key driver of management change. Gov-&#13;
ernmental hierarchy, however, embodies the most traditional cultural values of the bureaucracy.&#13;
In my comparative study of Mongolian and Japanese organizational cultures and management&#13;
features, I discovered some policy implications for managing change. By analyzing various re-&#13;
search reports as well as books by Dorj and Chimed (2000), Kono and Clegg (2001), and Kun-&#13;
ishima and Shoji (1996), I concluded that there are significant differences between the public or-&#13;
ganizational cultures of the two countries. Japanese management techniques (including such&#13;
star performers as lifetime employment, a seniority-based wage system, and consensus decision&#13;
making) clearly do not fit the nomadic Mongolian soil. There are policies and experiences, how-&#13;
ever, that are universally applicable. The comparison of these two nations' organizational cul-&#13;
tures is presented in table 6A.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Digital Divide&#13;
&#13;
Many developing countries suffer from the "digital divide" and these countries are not able to&#13;
deploy the appropriate infrastructure for e-government. The digital divide is generated by the&#13;
prevalence of digital technology, and refers to the opportunity gap between people who are able&#13;
to use and become educated in the technology and those people who are not. People's access to&#13;
technology is dependent on income, age, education level, geographic and physical constraints,&#13;
and so forth. This divide is recognized as a social issue (ITSH 2003).&#13;
   InfoCon (2003) has found that few official statistics on ICT development are available, and&#13;
that the lack of reliable data sources has restricted the preparation of a comprehensive study on&#13;
e-readiness assessment of Mongolia. Figure 6.3 illustrates Mongolia's electronic readiness to con-&#13;
nect with a networked world, as of 2003.7 The figure shows that, at that time, the ICT tools had&#13;
penetrated the city of Ulaanbaatar but their availability in rural areas was extremely limited. The&#13;
small market, low computer penetration, and high start-up costs for ICT businesses in rural areas&#13;
are significant barriers. The gap between information "haves" and "have-nots" is increasing not&#13;
only between urban and rural areas but also between downtown and suburban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Technological Change&#13;
&#13;
All countries implementing e-government have struggled to develop a basic infrastructure to&#13;
take advantage of new technologies and communications tools (World Bank 2002). Compaine&#13;
(2001) argued that technology casts a long shadow. Thus, there is time for society to see how&#13;
some technology or combinations of technologies move toward their natural markets and costs.&#13;
Because technological change automatically determines the jobs, however, it has a social and&#13;
human impact. As a result, a sociotechnical approach should be used jointly to choose the jobs&#13;
and the technology at the same time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Con team were based on the guide for developing countries, "Readiness for the Networked World," avail-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   In the mid-1990s, Mongolia embraced ICT, although it focused its efforts mainly on rehabili-&#13;
tating telecommunication networks and introducing some digital technology. This changed in&#13;
1996 when the first Internet service provider, Magicnet, was established in Mongolia.8&#13;
   Since 1999, the government has taken a broader interest in ICT that encompasses such matters&#13;
as e-government, e-commerce, and Mongolian application and content development. There are&#13;
reasonably better technological possibilities for using Internet and e-government services in Mon-&#13;
golia. The level of computerization in central and local governments, however, varies from place&#13;
to place, and it has become a major constraint to widely introducing e-government services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Public-Private Partnerships&#13;
&#13;
The private sector produces 80 percent of Mongolia's gross national product, so it is evident that&#13;
the sector is well established in the national economy. Mongolia's strategy for private sector de-&#13;
velopment is rooted in successful implementation of structural reforms in the production and&#13;
service sectors, especially in the privatizing of large state-owned enterprises (ADB 2004). Since&#13;
1995, private foreign mobile phone operators have entered the Mongolian telecommunications&#13;
market, and most Internet service providers are private companies.&#13;
   Within the public-private partnership framework, the government is cooperating successful-&#13;
ly with bank and financial organizations, telecommunications operators, Internet service pro-&#13;
viders, and computer trade companies. However, the government of Mongolia needs to clarify&#13;
procedures and financial arrangements for implementing a public-private partnership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Citizen Participation&#13;
&#13;
Citizen participation means taking an effective role in decision making and planning. Channels&#13;
through which the Mongolian citizenry can take part have opened through the growth of civil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   8. The first project was a domestic e-mail system called Mongolian Access to Global Information and&#13;
Communications Network--in shortened form, Magicnet.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
society, the expansion of the marketplace, the advancement of democracy, and the opportunities&#13;
of telecommunications. Public participation is low, however, because of a lack of initiative and&#13;
the inertia left behind by a command-administrative system that discouraged ordinary people&#13;
at the grassroots level from taking personal and community responsibility. In addition, low&#13;
population density, financial constraints, and underdeveloped communication networks have&#13;
added barriers to participation, and there exists a poor understanding of democracy and human&#13;
rights (GoM and UNDP 2003).&#13;
    In 2000, the Office of the Prime Minister launched the Web site http://open-government.mn.&#13;
The electronic participation mechanism includes online legislative and online policy forums.&#13;
Both are used frequently and appear to be very popular. In addition, there is an occasional "on-&#13;
line conference" in which users are given the opportunity to chat directly--albeit electronical-&#13;
ly--with identified officials (UN 2004). At this point (late 2006), however, this Web site address-&#13;
es only central government issues, so cooperation with local governments is needed to provide&#13;
a channel for local citizens' voices to be heard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
This report has revealed some important issues and challenges to consider in designing and im-&#13;
plementing successful e-government initiatives in Mongolia. The comparative study of Japan's&#13;
experience with electronic government offers a number of policy and process lessons that will&#13;
be useful in Mongolia.&#13;
    The first lesson addresses the establishment of a nationwide strategy for developing e-&#13;
government policy. The Japanese experience shows that development strategy should be care-&#13;
fully planned and implemented with the appropriate timing, human recourses, and financial&#13;
arrangements. These factors will help realize the overall goal. Furthermore, the Mongolian gov-&#13;
ernment should carefully investigate whether a strategy it is considering actually fits Mongo-&#13;
lian governance culture, tradition, and society.&#13;
    The second lesson from Japan is that ambitious leadership is needed for the e-government&#13;
initiatives. Political and governmental support for central and local e-government initiatives are&#13;
essential in setting up the required organizational structures.&#13;
    The importance of investing in human resource development is the third lesson learned from&#13;
the Japanese experience. Whitehill (1991) identified Japan's great resource not as its land but as&#13;
its people, with almost 100 percent literacy and an inborn love for learning and self-develop-&#13;
ment. Mongolia, too, quickly must become universally computer literate and must create the&#13;
basic skills for e-government.&#13;
    The fourth lesson Mongolia can take from Japan concerns which Japanese management tech-&#13;
niques are exportable. Life-long employment, wage systems based on seniority, and other poli-&#13;
cies have worked well in Japan, and although not all of them will be applicable in Mongolian&#13;
settings, there surely are ideas to be developed.&#13;
    The fifth lesson concerns how we adapt to new technology. A leading Japanese critic and ed-&#13;
itor (Kasuya 1989) perhaps described how best to approach the future in these well-chosen&#13;
words:&#13;
&#13;
    It is never easy to know what the future holds. The globalization and technological&#13;
    achievement are to be expected, but these trends alone do not provide a clear blueprint of&#13;
    what will transpire. Much will depend on how well we learn the lessons of our past suc-&#13;
    cesses and failures. To ensure that the success of the past 40 years is not squandered away&#13;
    in the next 40, we must reinvigorate the country's institutions to promote and maintain a&#13;
    dynamic society (p. 289).&#13;
&#13;
    Mongolians are largely influenced by a nomadic culture, which produces a flexible mindset.&#13;
For centuries, we have been learning to adapt to ever-changing environments, and that should&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                             Odgerel Ulziikhutag  101&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
equip us to flow with changes in technology. However, low computer literacy and little local&#13;
content are significant challenges for adapting e-government applications in Mongolia.&#13;
   The sixth lesson concerns bridging the digital divide. The government of Mongolia needs to&#13;
take action to develop local e-government policy, to implement universal services in rural areas,&#13;
and to improve broadband Internet access in suburban areas. Japan's experiences with local e-&#13;
government initiatives, a universal service fund system, and ultra-low interest and tax incen-&#13;
tives could be good examples.&#13;
   The importance of developing public-private partnerships is the seventh lesson we learn&#13;
from Japan. Mongolia needs to develop clear e-government policies for building trust between&#13;
government and the private sector. Success demands that policies for implementing these part-&#13;
nerships be well designed and formulated, and that procedures and financial arrangements are&#13;
clarified for all parties.&#13;
   The last lesson for Mongolia concerns the improvement of citizen participation in e-government.&#13;
Mongolia's leaders recognize that e-government can help strengthen citizen participation in the&#13;
decision-making process and can promote open and accountable government. Adapting some&#13;
of the methods Japan uses to open a dialogue between its elected leaders and its citizens may&#13;
promote participation in our country.&#13;
