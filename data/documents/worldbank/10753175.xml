            Africa - Regional Communication
            Infrastructure Program Third Adaptable Program Loan :
            Tanzania Communications Infrastructure and eGovernment Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Regional
            Communications Infrastructure Program Third Adaptable
            Program Loan Tanzania Communications Infrastructure and
            eGovernment Project in Africa is to support the
            Recipient's efforts to: (i) lower prices for
            international capacity and extend the geographic reach of
            broadband networks; and (ii) improve the Government's
            efficiency and transparency through eGovernment
            applications. There are four components to the project. The
            first component of the project is enabling environment. This
            component will provide support for capacity building in
            order to strengthen the policy and regulatory environment
            and promote further sector reform in order to maximize
            benefits from access to international capacity. This
            component will also finance technical assistance (TA)
            necessary to support the successful implementation of this
            component and component two. The second component of the
            project is connectivity. This component will provide
            additional funding through the following subcomponents: (a)
            support for pre-purchase of international bandwidth for
            priority targeted user groups - advance purchase of
            international bandwidth to boost the use of broadband
            capacity by priority groups; (b) financing for a Government
            Communications Network (GovNet) - financing of fiber
            connectivity and equipment for Ministries and other MDAs in
            Dar es Salaam; and (c) support for the extension of coverage
            and access to ICT services in rural areas using PPP
            arrangements - competitive award of "least-cost"
            capital subsidies through an OBA tender process to private
            operators in order to achieve universal access targets by
            encouraging the private sector to invest in rural and
            underserved areas which are commercially not viable. The
            third component of the project is eGovernment applications.
            This component will fund the implementation of targeted
            eGovernment applications such as: (a) national business
            portal - provision of a one-stop shop for all business
            registration information needed by the public and business
            entities as well as downloadable licensing applications and
            links to the national business registry database; and (b)
            telemedicine system for the Muhimbili National Hospital
            (MNH) - improvement of health care and delivery of health
            services using e-referrals, e-radiology, and e-consultations
            amongst the major hospitals in Tanzania. The fourth
            component of the project is project management support. This
            component will consist of support to finance project
            management related issues including project coordination,
            procurement, financial management, monitoring and
            evaluation, project communication, and environmental and
            social safeguards.
