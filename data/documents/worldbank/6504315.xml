            This Note reviews trends in official
            development assistance, focusing on volumes, sources, forms,
            and recipients. Several patterns emerge. First, a long-term
            trend of official flows taking the form of hard loans rather
            than grants and soft loans, with low interest and long
            maturities, has been reversed in the past five years.
            Second, both grants and loans are increasingly aimed at
            middle-income countries rather than the poorest. And third,
            official flows have fallen relative to rich-country income
            by 30 percent in the past 30 years.
