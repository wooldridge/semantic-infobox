ABSTRACT&#13;
Much of the existing Literature on Argentina has cmiphasized the&#13;
liberal nature of the economic reforms introdaced during the 1976-1981&#13;
military government.   A major purpose of this paper is to present evidence&#13;
that contradlcts this interpretation. In particular, I emphasiz~ the&#13;
imrlementation of pervasive government controls and argue thae the intensity&#13;
and Instability of these controls resulted in historically high short-run&#13;
flictuations of relative prices of commodities and factors.&#13;
The ,aper also .3ddresses some political-economy tssues. This&#13;
anralysis, I hope, shotuld help to understand better why policies were what they&#13;
were. A couple of important conclusions come out of this discussinn. First,&#13;
tCe Elucttiations in relative prices resulted in increased social tensions, but&#13;
given the repressive nature of the government, demands put forward by differ-&#13;
ent groups for taking corrective acttons were simply ignored. As a conse-&#13;
cuence, thf! disequilibrium of the economy -',which in turn was the, result- of,&#13;
the government, cont,rols - continued growing,, atnd 5z6'&gt;i last only as long aa&#13;
the financlal commiunity supplied the furds that were needed 'to finance the&#13;
-- resulcing imba1ances.&#13;
A second conclusion is that the long-rnn economic Interests'of those.-&#13;
who held effective political control were not fadyored by liberalization&#13;
policies.  As a matter of fact, the economic interests of the rAl1itary were&#13;
sheltered from the competitive forces faced by other parts ct the ,economy.&#13;

r. Introduction&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to present a critical overview of&#13;
policy reformis implemented i;- Argentina during 1976-1981.  Argentina's attempt&#13;
with these reforms, which many have interpreted as liberal policies, failed.&#13;
This failure has been taken as an argument by many people not only in&#13;
Argentina, but also in other developing countries of why liberalization&#13;
policies should not be attempted.&#13;
Any given set of policies can fail for several reasons.     A necessary&#13;
condition for p:;icies to be successful is that they be internally consistent&#13;
and credible.    On the other hand, if policies depart radically from past&#13;
trends, then it is very likely the case that old administrative arrangements&#13;
for managing and implementing them will have to be adapted to the new&#13;
conditions. Finally, policies can fal.l because the political arrangements to&#13;
manage poverful pressure groups that stand,'to-iose are in some sense,&#13;
inappropriate.&#13;

sions., Argentina 9'es nmcpoii&#13;
spell!i out  'a nature of the major economic"refoims, And also-presents some-&#13;
thoughts on the policy decision mechanism and the political economy that&#13;
accompanied these reforms.- These thought3, Ir hope, will help to understand&#13;
better why polisies were what they were., I also analyze in this paper the&#13;
effects of these policies on cbsolute and relative prices, but I do not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
discuss the impact of Lhese changes oni quantities, i.e., on the real structure&#13;
of the economy. 1/&#13;
Section II is a brief analysis of the initial economic conditions&#13;
prevailing before th- shift in political power that took place in March of&#13;
1976.  Section III presents some brief comments on the 1976-77 devaluation&#13;
episode. Such a devaluation was necessary for restoring equilibrium in the&#13;
balance of payments and eliminating many of the controls used during the&#13;
period of severe payments imbalances.   Despite the good start with exchange&#13;
rate policies, very soon policymakers became conc,-rned with the pervasive&#13;
inflationary trend of the e:onomy.  The initial response to this problem was&#13;
not different from the traditional one, i.e., the implementation of&#13;
macro2economic controls for stabilization purposes.  Section IV describes these&#13;
controls and the effect they had on absolute and relative macro-prices. The&#13;
point here is to irgue that the set of mac'ro-policies adopted during these&#13;
years were inconsistent with the publicized government objectives of&#13;
liberalizing the economy.&#13;
I n 'a very uncertain ma-cr -environment, sbme policies-leading-to ;&lt;&#13;
'lower'imp'oort barriers' lerreimpl'emented., Sec'tion V. analyzes the extent&#13;
and-appropriateness:.of these- policies. -When viewed in isolation, these&#13;
'policies had, important) shortca-mingst. Maany poliA;ticians and economi'sts-haye,&#13;
attributed the coscs associated with import pecnetration and the. huge 1980O&#13;
trade deficit to these import liberali_zation6policies. A point of;this&#13;
section is to emphasize that import penetration was the result,.f currency,&#13;
1/ Corbo, et al (1985) presents a su-vey of findings related to the&#13;
liberaliza-ion episodes in the Southern Cone including effects on the real,&#13;
economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
overvaluation as well as lower import barriers. I also emphasize here how&#13;
trade policy instruments were used to achieve different government&#13;
objectives.  This in turn led to policy instability and increased uncertainty.&#13;
Finally, section VI presents some preliminary thoughts on questions&#13;
referring to administrative arrangements and some characteristics cf the&#13;
underlying political-economy.   In this section I make four points.   First, the&#13;
underlying exchange rate models of the period under study differed quite&#13;
drastically irom the one which some authors have used to interpret the&#13;
economic events during the previous Peronist government. 1/    Nevertheless, the&#13;
natural tendency to use the exchange rate as an anti-inflAtion instrument did&#13;
not disappear.  In a sense, economists' models have not been able to sell to&#13;
the Argentine body politic the importance of following "realistic" exchange&#13;
rate policies.&#13;
-     Se.oind, the rarift and c change- rate rule which characterized -the&#13;
last two years of the economic program put important constraints on policy-&#13;
makers that were in different government offices and managing different&#13;
instiumehet-.3. "'Tihi 'ed to:'st'rong inter-agency cotnflicts which were at th-e;&#13;
government' level`the reffecition of socialVte'nsions that developed .from-&#13;
inappropriate imacro-policies. Because of the dictatorial form by which..&#13;
economic policies-;w.ere-desigri4d andÂ± iiiplermented, :these tensions could,not,'6be.&#13;
addressed-apprbriiatfely, and -as a consequence'corrective sctions %-ere&#13;
(stubbornly) delayed.&#13;
The third point is simple but a very important one.    The managers, of&#13;
a liberalization attempt should ideally be free of the economic interests and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4-4&#13;
pressures aissociated with highly pr:.tected and inefficient industries. An&#13;
important ,:rt of the manufacturing sector is the property of military&#13;
industries. Here I show how, by resorting to quantitative restrictions (QRs),&#13;
these industries managed to escape the pressures to adjust to increased import&#13;
competition that was being imposed on many other industries.&#13;
In che final point I stress the importance of institution-building&#13;
that should acconmpany a liberal policy reform.&#13;
II. Initial Conclitions&#13;
During 1975, the Argentine economy was once again suffering the&#13;
consequences of populist-protectionist policies. Expansionary government&#13;
policies and a reduction in public revenues led ro a fiscal deficit ,hat was&#13;
in the neighborhood of 15% of GNP.   This implied an increase of 100% from the&#13;
1974 figure, and in spite of generalized price controls, the-annual inflation&#13;
rate measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) reached a record high cf&#13;
192%. I/&#13;
'By 1975, the wage-price"agreements-reached-by labor un.ions,and-,&#13;
entrepreneurs in 197,3 and enforced by.governmental controls had.broken&#13;

intlation:  "... The attempt by different-grbup`s- of wcrkers to maintain th2ai&#13;
relative position ... were the principal cause 'pf inflation" and "..    Cpch&#13;
1/  For this yetar, the consumer price index (CPI) showed an inflation rate of&#13;
183%.  Recorded wholesale inflation rates during the 70's ha"e been: 1971:&#13;
39%; 1972: 77%; 1973: 50%; 1974: 20%; 1975: 192%; 1976: 499%; 1977: 149x;&#13;
1978: 146%; 1979: 149%; 1980: 75%.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
industry tried to increase the prices of their products through higher import&#13;
tariffs and lower tariffs on their imported inputs." (Di Tella, 1983, p.&#13;
269). To s great extent, the pub!;: sector deficit was a reflection of the&#13;
incapacity of the leadership elite to manage oressures put forward by&#13;
different groups.&#13;
T'his inflationary trend plus errors in designing and managing&#13;
exchange rate policies led to an increasing overvaluation of the domestic&#13;
currency. rhe extent of this overvaiuation can be assessed from data&#13;
presented in Table 1, whicn shows alternative exchange rate measures (cGlumn 1&#13;
through column 8), for the period 1'69-1981.   By 1975, and in relation to 1969&#13;
(a year for which there is every reason to believe that the exchange rate was&#13;
at an appropriate level 1/), the real exchange rat- (column 8) had declined&#13;
33X. 2/&#13;
T'he currency overvaluation increased excess demand for foreign.&#13;
exchange.  These press"rzc  on foreign exchange markets   were initially con-&#13;
fronted with traditional methods of drawing down reserves, and also increasing&#13;
't-he degree of rest.ri-ctioons,on international' transactions. -In December 1974,--;,&#13;
1/- In controlled exchtangee rate economies, it :is impossible,to'know-how close,,&#13;
the official rate-,&lt;is'.to the equilibrium-ra'te.  Nevertheless, there,ar,e&#13;
some eLcments backing the assertion in theZtext.    First, a black market   -&#13;
quotation in'line'with tne official rate -i's-an indication that.no s;gnifi-&#13;
cant exccess deriannd on foreign exchange markets was present. ..Second,.per-',&#13;
forming a PPP es31uation of the 1969 official :exchange rate using years in,&#13;
the early 60s when the exchange rate was floating shows that they ares;&#13;
similAr (Nogues,!985).   Also note in Table' lthat in 1969 the trade-.-.&#13;
balance was very -lose to equilibrium.                      -   -&#13;
2/  Alte-natively, using 1969 as the base year, a simple purchAsing power&#13;
parity estimat- ;PP) of the exchange rate (column 3) shows that in 1975&#13;
this value was 49Z higher than the rate-implicit in import,flows (column&#13;
2). See Officer (1976) on PPP exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
international reserves were US$1.3 billion. One year later, they were down to&#13;
US$.6 billion. This was mainly as a consequence of a sharp ircrease in the&#13;
trade d-licit, which in 1975 was equivalent to 33% of exports. This deficit&#13;
in turn resulted from a significant decline in exports of both traditional&#13;
(mainly primary goods), and noai-traditionai (mainly man'ifactured) goods. 1/&#13;
As excess demand pressures on foreign exchange mounted, authorities&#13;
increased the restrictionist character of the t-ade and payments regime.    The&#13;
arsenal of controls introduced and/or reinforced at that time included tight&#13;
Central Banl. controls on international payments, increased reliance on&#13;
quantitative restrictions and import licenses, increased numbers of goods in&#13;
lists affected by outright import prohibitions 2/, previous import deposits,&#13;
multiple exchange rates, etc, etc.&#13;
Controls on domestic capital markers wern equally severe. Peso&#13;
denominated deposits were subject to a 100% reserve requiremer.ts and credit&#13;
allorations were centrally planned by the Central Bank. Ccntrolled nominal&#13;
interest rates resulted in significantly subsidized real interest rates.    The&#13;
nominal ofi_i;'i  savings interest,rate was 17.5% in 1975, which, compares with&#13;
an inflation rate of 183t according'to the consumer price indexJ^PI).     These&#13;
differentiaLs represented a record high.&#13;
1/  According to Central Bank statistics the decline was 23% and 29% for,&#13;
r-aditional and non-traditionaL expo=rts r'espectively. Nevertheless,&#13;
caition should be taken when inteirpreting- official trade statistics in an&#13;
economy where the black market 'exchange rate (Table 1, column 4) is&#13;
siignificantly different from the official commercial cxchange rdte.&#13;
2/  1'he Cula PrActica del Exportador e Importador (Uifferent issues) include's&#13;
a detailed listing of the payments and' irport controls that were&#13;
implemented during the Peronist government. Restrictions on international&#13;
payments are listed in the Merrnorias Anuales del 'Banco Central.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Not surprisingly, the ratio of M2 to CNP dropped from 25% in 195i t&#13;
17% in 1975. This represented a resord low. Quotations in the black market&#13;
for foreign exchange soared. On an annual basis this quotation was during&#13;
1974, 83X higher than the implicit import rate. During 1975 the average&#13;
differential increased to more than 300% (Table 1, columns 2 and 4'1 rhis&#13;
came close! to being an historical record that has only been surpassed by trad&#13;
and payments distortions observed in the eae,ly 50s. 1/&#13;
More generally, black markets of an increasing number of marketable&#13;
products also developed rapidly due to the severity of price controls.&#13;
Scarrity margins have unfortunately not been documented, but the lengths and&#13;
number of the queues that Argentines had to make in order to obtain essential&#13;
consumer goods at controlled prices will not be forgotten.&#13;
Although not easily documented, it is reasonable to hypothesize tha&#13;
problems for obtaining crucial impzorts of intermediate inputs must hive&#13;
developed.. Civen that Argentina started its payments problems from a closed&#13;
econ-omy positionf,it couldonly cortail importis- that were' alreadyl essentiaL.}&#13;
These correspond vith"intermediate "and ca'pital go'ods imports, whi:h,,in.gene,ra&#13;
are used in productive processes of the manufacturing sector.&#13;
1/  It is also not far ftom being an interns.1onal record. -See-Krueger,,&#13;
(1978), Table 6.4, for a cross-country comp.Arisor of black market exchangi&#13;
rates, prevailing before a devaluation episode. In this ta'ole, out c' 17&#13;
observations, only two presented a greater discroorncy between official&#13;
and black market rates than the estimates presented for Argentina.&#13;
2/  Imports of consumer goods represented 3.72 and 3.3% of the import bill&#13;
during 1974 and 1975 cespectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
On the demand side, and in addition to the decline in exports (Tab&#13;
1, column 9), real wages stopped rising, 1/ and the unemployment rate began&#13;
increasing. Therefore, it might be asserted that both supply bottlenecks an&#13;
demand considerations help to e:plain the negative growth rate of -1% observ&#13;
during 1975. 2/&#13;
IlI. Devaluation Episode&#13;
In Late March 1976 the Peronist government which had been&#13;
democratically elected was cv-erthrown by a military ccup. 3/   The objective&#13;
economic liberalization was emphasized by the new economic minister in his&#13;
inaugural cpeech.&#13;
Several policies implemented during the initial months aimed in th&#13;
direction. First, the process of real devaluation wlhich had started during&#13;
the last months of the Peronist government was deepened and on average, the&#13;
real excnange rate increased 24% during 1976 (Table 1 column 8). The quick&#13;
response of exports ,t'o ti.e higher rea9"e'iang ~rate and reduced rate ofS&#13;
1/  According to official statistic- and using the CPI, real wages of un-&#13;
skilled workers were 7% higher in 1975 t'han in 1969, and did not change&#13;
relation to 1974 (Table 2).&#13;
2/  The corresponding rate for the manufacturing sector was -3%.&#13;
3/  In this month the WPI inflation rate reached an historic mark of 54%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
export taxation allowed a fast reduction of exchange ccntrols. 1/ Also, the&#13;
differentials among the relevant multiple exchange rates were gradualLy&#13;
reduced, and in Decembcr of 1976 the Central Bank implemented a unified&#13;
exchange rate regime.&#13;
Pa:tial dismantling of qu;tnritative restrictions on imports was als&#13;
undertaken.  -his, to a graac extent, represented A reduction in the number o&#13;
goods on the import list aff..cted by outright import prohibitions which, as&#13;
said, were part of the policy package designed to cope with balance of&#13;
payments problems during 1975. 2/&#13;
The gradual liberalization of the payments regime was accompanied b&#13;
almost total removal of price controls in domestic markets. The decision,&#13;
given the severity of the controls, cannot be sufficiently emphasized.&#13;
All this helped to restore the confidence on the rnarket mechanism&#13;
which had been se-erely damaged.   D'rhaps, because of this initial move, many&#13;
observers h'ave characterized economic policies cf the military regime as bti..&#13;
liberal. In 'what follows, I show evitdence'that casts serious .doubts on,the&#13;
extent to which Arge'ntine economic polici'estdureing these -years cdan.be.&#13;
classified as Liberal.   In essence, the stagnant behavior of the economy afte&#13;
'S.,&#13;

IV. The Changing Nature of Macroeconomic Conrrols 1/&#13;
I. Introduction&#13;
Ihe Economic- Minister that came to power in March of 1976 concluded&#13;
his administration in March 1981, when the President was also changed. For&#13;
analytical purpooes, it is useful to divide this period into two subperiods.&#13;
,te first exr'!nds from March 1976 to the end of 1978. I call this the unanti-&#13;
cipated period, because in relation to .he second period. economic policies&#13;
were highly unpredictable, and not announced in advance. The second period&#13;
extends from the end of 1978 to March 1981. This is the period when exchange&#13;
rate and tariff policies wece   realnr3unced, and I have therefore labeled it&#13;
the preannounced period.&#13;
2. The unanticipated period:    1976-1978&#13;
2.1. Wage policy&#13;
From 1976 to late 1978, there; existed,at different points in- ti&#13;
severe controls on onse or more of the followirng variables:  wages, intercs'r,&#13;
rates, pricesdand -probably the most irnportantof them all, .on the exchange,.,&#13;
rate.&#13;
Initially after the coup, the decision zo liberalize domestic.&#13;
markets and eliminate the regime of price controls was accompanied by the&#13;
imposition of'severe wage controls. According to official statistics, during.&#13;
1/ Since this paper was ccmp1eted in late 1983, several articles analyzing&#13;
the economic policies and economic performance of the milicary regi' mh:c&#13;
been published. These include among others Calvo (1985), Dornbusch&#13;
(1984), and Fischer et. al. (1984).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
1976 these controls resulted in a record reduction of real wages that for&#13;
relatively unskilled workers was 49% in relation to 1975 (Table 2). These&#13;
wage controls pu; the real wage well below historical levels.&#13;
After the wage freeze had been imposed, tt.e monthly inflation rate&#13;
measured with the CPI which hall reached a record high of 38% in March of ::976&#13;
showed the following trend:   34% in Ar.ril, 12% in May, and 3% in June.  G:.ven&#13;
that price controls had by then been eliminated and a process of re&amp;l&#13;
devaluation was taking place, it is difficult to explain such a drastic&#13;
reduction in the inflation rate without relating it to the wage freeze.&#13;
The wage freeze distorted the underlying trend inflation rate for a&#13;
short time.  This in turn confused policymakers, and the subsequient rebound of&#13;
inflation was taken by =any 29 a first failure of the e-^ncmic team to&#13;
stabilize the price level. This then led policymakers to implement new&#13;
controls. This experience therefore suggests that, in addition to the well-&#13;
known negative economic effects of wtge controls, maintaining relatively free&#13;
labor markets during a stebilization attempt would have provided,more accurate&#13;
t&#13;
signals t~o p0 i'cyi'akers regarding the' cacroecsonomic'impact 'of the iwv.t. bf,'.&#13;
policies.&#13;
Why, ve're'wage'controls imp  e'dX$)i p6p7lar 'nypothesis has linked ;&#13;
these controls to government objectives.regarding unemployment.   The social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and political tensions of that time 1/ should not, according to a hypothesized&#13;
official view, be permitted to increase.   It was feared that iafur unrest&#13;
could be triggered by increased unemployment.   Therefore, reducing real wages&#13;
while at the same time maintaining high legal layoff costs, would help to hold&#13;
employnent levels and keep the unemployment rate low. 2/&#13;
An alternative but non-conflicting hypothesis is that just as price&#13;
controLs had been used by the previous government, the new economic adminis-&#13;
tration resorted to wage controls as an anti-inflation device.   If so, the&#13;
cotnclusion is that the 2hift in the struczure of political power led the&#13;
government to change the group whose economic behavior was directly&#13;
controlled.&#13;
The wage freeze was gradually relaxed and apparently was net binding&#13;
after 1977. 3/  Nevertheless, while the labor market was gradually freed from&#13;
1/  It is important to recall that strong labor unions and the leadership&#13;
which they held within the labor movement provided the main political base&#13;
of the'Perohist-government.   Therefore, the power of labor union teaders;&#13;
-gaiined' momentum'Aduring these -ears'.. Ce-rt4aitnly one of the political"'&#13;
otjectives q.f.theicoup was to break the porirtical and economic_power'ot&#13;
these unions.  The'leaders that could. not' escape were imprisoneai without'&#13;
trial for years.  Alsc, the econooixc activities of these unions were   -&#13;
-'termina'tetl..&#13;
2/ The implicit. assuimpt'ion regarding sociall-~behavior is that labor unrest&#13;
would not'develop'from low wages.' This, in fact, occurred but'9e 'reason&#13;
is to a great extent also related to the'repression that was taking place"'&#13;
al: that time.  Official statistics show that the open unemploymentrate in&#13;
the major industrial areas declined during 1976.   In Cran Buenos Aires,  U&#13;
Cordoba and Rosario, the open unemployment rates declined from 4.8'%, ,6.51-&#13;
and 5.32 in April to 4.1%, 5.4%, and 2.61 in October.   On the 6ther hand','&#13;
maanufacturing output declined between the last quarter of 1975' and the'`'&#13;
first quarter of 1976. The behavior of these variables is in'line wi'th&#13;
the hypothesized expectation of government officials in regard to the&#13;
effects that the wage freeze would have bn employment levels.&#13;
3/ See, for example, Meier et al (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
direct government interferences, significant taxes on wages were maintained&#13;
during practically che whole period. Elsewhere I have shown that in 1973 the&#13;
implicit tax rate on wages was equivalent to 22% of gross wages. 1/ These&#13;
distortions, which had grown during the initial months of the Peronist regime,&#13;
were only reduced towards the end of 1980 when the collapse of the economic&#13;
program was evident. 2/   Clearly from a resource-allocational poinLt of view,&#13;
it would have been preferable to reduce labor costs by reducing these taxes as&#13;
an alternative to having frozen wages. 3/&#13;
2.2. Price contrels&#13;
As said, after June 1976 the inflation rate began increasing and&#13;
according to the 'IPI reached a monthly rate of 14% in January 1977. This led&#13;
policymakers to reintroduce price controls which, as said, had been abolished&#13;
in the early months following the coup. These controls were implemented from&#13;
February - less than a year from the date they.had last been abolished,- to&#13;
July 1977. They were rigorously enforced with relatively big,enterprises,in,&#13;
the manuf'acturi'ng sector.  While these controls were lifted in Juey:nd.'eere,&#13;
not reintroduced thereafter, they clearly compounded the negative economic&#13;
,effects of- the,wage freeze.  Summing u4p:, .b;een,t4976 and 1977 the military,&#13;
governrment introduced severe wage and priceb'on,tirols.&#13;
1/ Nogues (1985).&#13;
2/  A reform of the value added tax (VAT) was implemented in October of&#13;
1980.. Along with this reform several taAes on wages were eliminated.&#13;
3/ Obviously, together with this p^licy sh.ft, other less distortionary taxes&#13;
and/or reduced government spending measures should be implemented.        -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2.3. Interest race policies, capital inflows and exchange rate control&#13;
By the end of 1976 the process of exchange rate unification and real&#13;
devaluation had been completed. Following liberslization of exchange&#13;
controls, the Central Bank implemented a monetary reforra. The regime of 100%&#13;
reserve .equirements for peso depojits, direct credit allocation and&#13;
controlled interest rates was substituted by one of fractionary minimum&#13;
reserve require-ents in a context of nearly complete freedom of interest&#13;
rates. 1/ It is of interest to emphasize that this financial liberalization&#13;
was introduced at the same time when wage-price controls were enforced. It is&#13;
difficult to rationalize this inconsistent pouliy behavior.&#13;
Real interest rates increased significantly (Table 2). These&#13;
interest rates, coupled with the liberalization of the capital account of the&#13;
balence of.pitymenti fueled short-term capital inflows, which together with&#13;
positive trade balances, increased foreign exchange reserves. These reserves&#13;
went from US$1.8 billion in 1976 to US$4.0 and US$o.O billion in December 1977&#13;
e.Jn 1978 respec'tevely.&#13;
Probably'bbe'cause the inflat,ion rate continued to be high-in.,a&#13;
situation of increasint foreign exchange rerervei and trade balance surpluees,,&#13;
economic aiuthoritga.s%jed 'by the Central Bank,,4decided to reduce the rate,of`"&#13;
devaluatir)n dir.ing119'78.  This policy was not announced in advance, and&#13;
ii It is usually overlooked that interest rates for financing non-traditional&#13;
exports were never eliminated. This control implied high interest rate&#13;
subsidies per peno exported. (Nogu4s 1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
implied a ralical departure from the policy followed during 1977 of&#13;
maintaining relatively constant the real exchange rate. 1/&#13;
As seen in Table 1 (column B), the real exchange rate dropped 14%&#13;
during 1978.   In addition to its effects on the price level, another objective&#13;
of the new exchange rate policy during 1978 was to create exchange rate&#13;
uncertainty. It was thought at the Central Bank, that this uncertainty would&#13;
reduce incentives to capital inflows due to the high level of domestic&#13;
interest rates.&#13;
IL should be stressed, and this is important to emphasize in order&#13;
to understand what was going on, that instability in the rates of&#13;
minidevaluation was a policy favored by the strong beliefs held by Central&#13;
Bank decisionrmakers regarding the lack of effectiveness of direct controls on&#13;
capital movements. 2/ Clearly an important dilemma was being faced at that&#13;
time by policymakers in the Central Bank. They perceived capital inflows as&#13;
being inflationary, and financial controls to be ineffective. Unfortunately,&#13;
such 'i priori thoughts which help to understand the nature of policies&#13;
implemented during 1979-81 have been'very cost,ly,.  I now turn,to a bridf&#13;
description of: these policies.&#13;
1/  By then, Argentina had repaid its loans-to the IMF.&#13;
2/ For examiple, Arriaz6a (1983), has asserted that: "...It is possible that&#13;
for some countries the answer (to the question of whetber capital move-&#13;
mernts can be controLlecl) would be positive but in wy opinic- n.^t for&#13;
Argentina...."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
3.  Thu pr.t:nncunced period:  1979-1981&#13;
As said, after the iiberalization of nominal interest rates in June&#13;
of 1977, real interest rates remained abnormally high during 1978 (Table 2).&#13;
Unfortunately, the level of interest rates during this period remains as yet&#13;
one of the most important unexplained effects of the economic program. It is&#13;
true that not all barriers to international capital movements had been&#13;
lifted. But ilt is dtub:.ful that thuse remaining could go a long way in&#13;
explaining the difference between domestic and international interest rates,&#13;
in presence of high mobility of short-run financial capital. Part of the&#13;
explanation of high real interest rateSs must be attributed to government&#13;
deficits, which as a proportion of CDP were 3.20% and 3.75% during 1977 and&#13;
1978 respectively. These deficits were financed by borrowing.&#13;
z hbothesized view suggests that preannouncement of the future&#13;
path of the exchange rate was seen as the solution to several economic&#13;
problems;. 1/ First, preannouncement of a declining rate of devaluation would&#13;
dampen inflationary expectations, thus, helping to impart a downward trend on&#13;
the rate!of,inflation.  It was also thought that preannouncement-would:,reduce &#13;
uncertainties associated with a nianaged exchange rate policy and rherefore, -&#13;
help to reduce re'al interest rates.&#13;
This implied another radical- departure fror, points of view,thati,the,&#13;
same policymakers had held in previous months.. Policymakers, I hypot.hesize,y%&#13;
concluded that 1978 exchange rate uncertainty, had negative-effectd on,;resl,&#13;
1/  Preannounzement of the future price of the exchange rate was also&#13;
accompanied by similar announcements of minimum wages and prices of,goods&#13;
and services supplied by public enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
domestic interest rates, and they decided to ch2nge exchange rate policy once&#13;
again. Preannouncement was thought to provide certeinty thus helping to&#13;
reduce real rates of interest and dampen inflationary expectations.&#13;
Policymakers in the Central Bank were, therefore, expecting that&#13;
prearnouncement of the exchange rate path would be the instrument by which&#13;
they would achieve the double goal of reducing the inflation And real interest&#13;
rates. 1/&#13;
Between Januaty 1979 and March 1981 when this policy was fortunately&#13;
discontinued, and contrary to pc:icymaker's expectaticns, domestic prices had&#13;
not converged to international inflation plus devaluation. Estimates of the&#13;
discrepancies between these two seri.:s are presented in Table 3. Even in the&#13;
last quarter of 1980 the inflation rate, as measured by the U2I, continued to&#13;
increase - although at a declining rate - in spite of reductions in both&#13;
internetional inflation and the rate of-devaluation.    Table 3 shows that&#13;
between the iirst quarter of 1979 and the last quartcr of 1980, domestic&#13;
accumulated inflation had reached 260Z. In contrast, international inflation&#13;
plus-dE'valuation' summed 134Z,-during th4e:1samepetiod. 2.1' The resultrwas 'a&#13;
1/  The methodology used for determ'ning the preannounced rates of,devaluation&#13;
is 'resented in ArriazSi (1983).'&#13;
2/ Later, I present some hypothesis which explain this lack of convergence.&#13;
These hyporhesis refer mainly to the characteristics of the structure of&#13;
protection that accompanied the stabilization package.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
significant drop in the real exchange rate of 311 between 1978 and 1980 (Table&#13;
1 column 8). 1/&#13;
The objective. of r-ducin3 the real interest rate was psrtially&#13;
achieved during 1979 (Table 2). Nevertheless, by the end of the year the real&#13;
exchange rate coupled with lower import barriers, triggered an upsurge in&#13;
imports. In current dollars duri.ag 1980 these were up 57% from 1979, and the&#13;
trade deficit reached a record high level of $2.5 billion. This represented&#13;
31% of that: year's exports. This percentage is in the same order of magnitude&#13;
as that observed in the crisis year of 1975, just before the military&#13;
government came to power.&#13;
Rleal interest rate3 increased pari passu with the increased&#13;
uncertainty regarding ti:e maintenance of exchange rate policy. In turn, high&#13;
interest rates and the elimination of the relatively minor contrc7s on capital&#13;
flows that were still in effect in July 1980 2/ attracted additional short-&#13;
term capit,dl inflo-is.&#13;
But the social profitability of these capital inflows has been&#13;
negative.   For domestic residents, it was obviou's that. the; '980 real exchange&#13;
rate was unsustainable. 'Therefore, these rsidnts decided to increase their&#13;
holdings of foreign exchange, and,eventually send an important.portion,of&#13;
1!  nte role played by persistent fiscal deficits and capital inflows in-&#13;
expiZining this currency overvaluation is discussed in Corbo et. al.&#13;

these abroad. 1/ This process was financed by foreign banks who at that&#13;
time, overlooked basic indicators that were signalling iuture balance of&#13;
payments problems to Argentina. The inte national financial community was&#13;
expecting to reap important profits from Argentina's high reAl intere3t rates,&#13;
when in fact, the level of these rates were to a great extent the consequence&#13;
of disequilibrium exchange rates. Clearly, the international financial&#13;
community nsde serious judgmental errors regarding the medium term repaymerit&#13;
ability of Argentina.&#13;
The consequencc of disequilibrium macroeconomic policies and of the&#13;
international ''nancial community overlooking these policies has been a&#13;
tremend:us jump in Argentina's foreign debt. ihis debt increased from US$5.6&#13;
billion in 1971 to US$37.0 billion in 1981. Solutions to the consequences of&#13;
macro-policy errors of the magnitude that has been pointed have not yet been&#13;
found. For the time Leing, the Lurden of Argentina's policy mistakes is lying&#13;
exclusively on this country's future generations.&#13;
I hope that the material presentee in the previous discussion puts&#13;
some doubt on those who might still think that Argentina's macroeconomic&#13;
policies during 1976-'1981 were liberal'in a meaningful economi: interpretation&#13;
of the word.  In the inappropriate macroeconomic setting which I have&#13;
described, sorme trade liberalization!pbl'cies. were implemented.  Nevertheless,&#13;
when viewed in a broaci context, these policies had numerous errors, and the&#13;
next section io an attempt to point out some ofjthem.&#13;

flights has beer. studied by Cuddington-(1985). See also Dornbusch.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
V.  A uLantitative Assearment of Trade Liberalization.&#13;
1. Indicators of trade liberalization&#13;
Ideally, a dynamic evaluation of the extent of trade liberalization&#13;
could be approximated empirically by time series estimates of nominal and&#13;
effective rates of protection. But because careful estimates of these&#13;
vars..bles are expensive and time-consuming, they are usually not available.&#13;
At least, this is the case in the Argentine economy.&#13;
In this section, I will assess approximately the extent Or trade&#13;
liberalization by analyzing the behavior of effective exchange rates. 1/ For&#13;
ease of exposition, I define the following four cdtegories of effective&#13;
exchange rates 2/ (EERs):&#13;
EERis corresponds tc import-subsritute industries&#13;
EER.   corresponds to non-conpetitive imports&#13;
fcimp&#13;
EER te corresponds to traditional exports&#13;
EER -t orr esponds to non-traditional exports&#13;
A typical import substitution (IS) country is characterized by the&#13;
following escalation of EER,:&#13;
&gt;-nt,e', ,rimp     -^te&#13;
1/ The! effective exchange rare on any given product is defined as the,nomina,l,,&#13;
exchange rate times one plus (minus) the ad-valorem tariff ,quivalent of&#13;
all taxes levied un it before it is landed'(exported) into (from) the,&#13;
country.&#13;
2/ J3i.ng only four categories of goods does not allow a close examination of&#13;
the variance of incentives that typically characterize import-substitution&#13;
economies. Nevertheless, some comments in this. respect will-be made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
In *ords: the EER provided to IS industries for their sales in the domestic&#13;
market (EERi ) is higher than that provided for its export sales (EERnte), I/&#13;
which in turn is in general higher than the effective exchange rate applied on&#13;
imports of :nterrnediate inputs and capital goods not domestically preauced&#13;
(EERimp ). 21  Finally, this last rate is in turn higher than that r,.ceived by&#13;
exporters of traditional goods (EERte) which in general are taxed.&#13;
A necessary condition for there to be trade liberalization is to&#13;
observe a reduction in the difference between EERi5 and EERtet as a&#13;
consequence of both a reduction in EERi. and an increase of EERtES. On the&#13;
euport side, it is also important to observe a reduction in the difference&#13;
between EE.Rnte and EER te'&#13;
2.  Export barriers and effective exchange rates on exports&#13;
Several major changes of export trade policies were introduced. In&#13;
the first place, in early 1976, the rates of export taration on traditional&#13;
exports wr:re extremely high. Major grains were affected by export tax rates&#13;
in the neighborhood of 50%. The corresponding rate for wool was 33Z, while&#13;
- thsit of meat was'l2'1'V"3/&#13;
Duri'ng'l'ate1976 ane 1977, the rates&gt;off export taxation were reduced,&#13;
drasticalty exceptif-or'Qmeat.  In pa'ticuliiV,the _rates applied,on major. grains,&#13;
were reduced to 16i- ini977 and to'5-6I thereatter.   Tax rates on,exports ma'de&#13;
l/  In protectionist countries such as Argentina;! the height of export,&#13;
incentives for non-traditional exports isjl,ower than the height of,import.&#13;
protection for domestic sales.&#13;
2/  In many cases, these ii.ports enter duty free or pay a very low tariff.&#13;
3/  Export tax rates increased significantly as the fiscal ,deficit soared&#13;
during the latest period of the Peronist government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
by exportable manufacturing industries were also reduced. For example, tax&#13;
rates on exports of vegetable oils were reduced from values ranging from 48%&#13;
in 1975 to 3% in 1977. Processed meats, hides, and wool were also affected by&#13;
significant reductions in export taxes.&#13;
Therefore, agriculture and exportable manufacturing industries&#13;
received the full impact of real devaluation. The resulting increase in real&#13;
effective exchange rates was particularly high for these sectors because of&#13;
the elimination of the multiple exchange rate regime, and the reductions in&#13;
rates of export taxa'Lon.&#13;
Between 1975 and 1977 the real exchange rate (defined as the nominal&#13;
exchange rate deflated by the WPI) increased 29Z (Table 1, column 7). In&#13;
contrast, the price-level-deflated EER (PLD-EER) of the primary sector&#13;
increased more than 60% except for meat, and that of manufactured exportables&#13;
by 39% (Table 4).&#13;
On the other hand, PLD-EERs of non-traditional exports increased&#13;
during the same pcriod only 9%. Nevertheless, these estimates do not&#13;
-1 ,..... -  .. .. .. ..-,,-  .i  ............................... . . . . . . . . . . . ................................................................... ,- &#13;
incorporate interest rate subsidies forthcomi'ng'ffrom credit lines,granted by,,&#13;
the Central Batik for export financing.  I have. estimated elsewhere (Nogues&#13;
1983) that for,4.the great majority of non-.traditional exports, "potential,&#13;
interest rate subsidies per peso exported-wer'e iot higher than 20%.-&#13;
Therefore, it'can be con.luded that fiscal and.financial export policies.&#13;
initially implied a reduction in the bias between incentives.granted,to,! &#13;
dif'ferent types of exports.  Export policies were therefore initially moving&#13;
in the right direction.&#13;
After 1977, PLD-EERs for exports closely followed the path-of the&#13;
retal exchange rate.  Letting 1976, the devaluation year, take a value of 100,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
by 1978 th,e PLD-EERs of meat and exportable manufacturing industries had&#13;
dropped to 60 and 62 respectively (Table 4). Except for grains, where export&#13;
taxes were! further lowered during this year, reductions of PLD-EERs were also&#13;
considerable in other exportable industries.&#13;
I know of no other experience that in such a short time-span has&#13;
gore through such drastic changes in real incentives. 1/&#13;
The Argentine experience is in this regard quite unique. Removal of&#13;
export barri.,: and real devaluation led to trade surpluses. While the&#13;
country did en.gage in some external borrowing, this was more the result of&#13;
market forces than of government efforts to rebuild foreign exchange&#13;
reserves. While other countries reducing trade barriers initially had to&#13;
borrow externally, Argentina could have done for some time without additional&#13;
borrowing. By the end of 1977 policymakers had an important decision to&#13;
make.  In order to achieve a trade balance they could either appreciate the&#13;
domestic currency, 2/ or alternatively, dismantle import barriers more&#13;
rapidly. As said, policymakers chose the first alternative. The failure to&#13;
initially liberal'ize -imports 'is central to the- explanation of the collapse,of&#13;
the program at' &amp;4;au'ir stage. --If 'i'mports;ha'd- ben liberalized faster, foreign&#13;
exchange reserves would not have increased-as fast, and therefore, so the&#13;
1/  Krueger (1978) analyzes the behavior-of PLD-EER (Table 5.3) for ten.-&#13;
different countries in twenty-two'different devaluation episodes.     In,that&#13;
sample there is not one single casetof'reduction in PLD-EERs within&#13;
adjacent two years from the time of devaluation such as the extreme,ones,&#13;
observed in Argentina.&#13;
2/ Some economists argue that the dismantling of export barriers and&#13;
liberalization of the capital account implied a lower exchange rate than&#13;
that observed in 1977. Sjaastad and Rodriguez (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
hypothesis goes, policymakers would have been less inclined to follow real&#13;
appreciation policies.&#13;
The further deterioration of the real exchange rate that followed&#13;
preant.ouncement of this variable after 1979 was accompanied closely by similar&#13;
reductions of PLD-EERs. Table 4 shows that by 1919 the PLD-EERs of all export&#13;
categories were lower than the value observed in the crisis year of 1975i It&#13;
might be concluded that the price effects of export liberalization and&#13;
devaluation that took place during 1976 and 1977 had been eliminated by&#13;
currency overvaluation as early as 1979. Unfortunately, effective exchange&#13;
rates continued declining in 1980.&#13;
3. Tariff policy and price divergence in import-substitute industries&#13;
If all goods in the economy were tradables it would be impossible to&#13;
observe in the long run significant diversions of domestic from international&#13;
prices adjusted by the exchange rate. If commodity arDitrage takes place&#13;
through competitive markets, the duration of whatever discrepancy might appear&#13;
would he a`'unih'cco'' of' the duratibn'of-thela,bitrage process.,&#13;
Table 3.shows' that during the period,when the exchange rate,was&#13;
preannounced, the change in domestic prices did not equal the;,s*tm of,deva,lua-,-&#13;
tio&amp;plus- in'tern'ational inflation. 1/  E a    -in_the last quarter ,of ,1980when -,&#13;
the rate of devaluation and internationatlinflation were decreasing, domest,ic&#13;
inflation  was still increasing.   The puzzle islstill more astonishing.when&#13;
account is taken of the fact that import 'tariffs were declining, and also-that,&#13;
1/ 1'he economic program lasted until March 1981. Nevertheless, an unexpected&#13;
10% devaluation was made in February of t!at year, so in essence-the&#13;
program ended in January 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 5 -&#13;
commodities included in the WPI are tradables in the traditional definition of&#13;
not being protected by prohibitive transport cost barriers. Table 5 shows&#13;
that price divergence was most pronnounced in importable goods.&#13;
Broadly speaking, there are three hypotheses explaining why there&#13;
was such a difference between actual price behavior and the one forecasted by&#13;
the exchange rate rule. 1/ The first hypothesis of why prices behaved&#13;
sluggishly points to the existence of lags and market imperfections that do&#13;
not-disappear rapidly, even after an important reduction of import barriers&#13;
has been implemented.  The second hypothesis is based on the credibility that&#13;
agents put on the economic program and the economic behavior that this&#13;
credibility might have triggered.   Finally, a third non-conflicting hypothesis&#13;
is that import barriers were not reduced that much, and that, therefore, there&#13;
never existed a generalized potential threat to domestic producers of&#13;
competitive imports. I comment briefly on each of these hypotheses.&#13;
The first hypothesis is built from different lines of reasoning.&#13;
First, there are some ad hoc stories that stress the existence of lags in the&#13;
arbitrage pr;. ss.  There is first a lag until agents realize that ,profits can&#13;
'be made-by engaging in initernatibnal-"commodity -arbitrage activities.  A second,&#13;
lag is explained by the duration of the search process through which the&#13;
would-be impovte'r, mu'st go.  Recall that in 'a typical iimport substitution&#13;
economy, a great -majority of goods, and particularly consumer, goods, have not&#13;
1/  To the extent that capital inflows and fiscal deficits increasead the.&#13;
relative price of non-tradable, some oiscrepancy between the price&#13;
behavior of domestic import-competing and imported goods wouled have been&#13;
observed anyhow (see Corbo et. al. 1985). The discussion that follows&#13;
analyses other reasons for the discrepancy between domestic and inter-&#13;
national prices of importable goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vso -&#13;
been introduced to the country for decades. It is therefore not obvious at&#13;
the beginning of the liberaLization episode which goods to introduce and which&#13;
foreign suppliers to approach.&#13;
Closely related stories also haie some appeal for other types of&#13;
goods. In particular, in an I-S economy, the bulk of imports are non-&#13;
competing. These usually include intermediate imports and capital goods.&#13;
These imports are generally made by the sane enterprises that use them in the&#13;
productive process.   For our purposes, this implies that initially the economy&#13;
is characterized by the lack of importers-wholesalers who presumably would act&#13;
promptly when opportunities for profit from importing appear.&#13;
This hypothesis suggests that liberalization attempts cf I-S&#13;
economies must face rigidities and imperfections of the price mechanism, which&#13;
can be attributed to the nature of I-S policies and the structural economi'&#13;
charqcteristics that result from such poliies, and which do not disappear&#13;
rapidly when import liberalization occurs.&#13;
A second hypothesis for explaining price divergence is related-to&#13;
the degree of agents' confidence in policies. We have already presented&#13;
evidence on the uncertainty that surrounded policymaking and,implementation.,&#13;
In I-S countries in general and Argentina in particular, the greatest-macro-&#13;
--uincertainty hai historically originated from instability of;the real,excNhange:&#13;
rate.  It,is reasonable to hypothesize, that unless agents were,shortTsighted,&#13;
from past history they would have forecasted a-high likelihood of_ being,again&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
subjected to exchange rate variability. 1/ In this environment, agents would&#13;
have second thoughts before investing heavily in international tradable&#13;
activities. T'his being tthe case, chances are that the international price&#13;
arbitrage process could be severely impaired when economic policies are not&#13;
credible. I have pointed above to several characteristics of policy reforms&#13;
which suggest that this lack of credibility might have characterized agents'&#13;
expectations during these years.&#13;
The above problems and explanations of dynamic price divergence are&#13;
independent of the existence of water in the tariff. 2/ On the other hand,&#13;
the generalized existence of tariff redundancy and the absence of competitive&#13;
imports provides an additional explanation for the lack of convergence of&#13;
domestic to international prices. In presence of water in the tariff, there&#13;
is no reascn why changes in domestic prices should follow changes in tariff&#13;
rates, or for that matter, chdnges in the exchange rate. This explanation is&#13;
independent of market structures and credibility factors and therefore&#13;
reinforces the above explanacions.&#13;
1/  As seen, the' real exchange rate declined all'along the period of&#13;
preannouncement.- This continued the.trend thAt had already started in&#13;
1978, and therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that agents were_-&#13;
already in early 1979 forecasting an exchange rate crisis. See.Kaminsky&#13;
(1983) for an econometric analysis showing that agents did not believe in&#13;
the maintenance of the Central Ban- preannouncement of the exchlange&#13;
rate. See also Dornbusch (1984).&#13;
2/ There is water in the tariff or tariff redundancy when the value of the&#13;
legal tariff rate is higher than the value that makes competitive imports&#13;
prohibitive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I will now describe critically tariff policy and comment on the&#13;
magnitude of tariff rcdundancy. 1/   The record on dismantling import barriers&#13;
shows that the first and unexpected move was mrade in November 1976, i.e., six&#13;
months after the new government had taken power.    Even though the new tariff&#13;
structure was still highly escalated, 2/ the most significant change made in&#13;
this oc:asion was in regard to maximu.n rates, which was reduced from values&#13;
that were higher than 200% to a new maximum of 100%. 3/&#13;
These rates correspond generally to consumer goods. Nevertheless,&#13;
the impact of these changes was not reflected in the structure of imports.&#13;
The percentage participation of consumers goods in the import bill was still&#13;
very low during 1977. 4/&#13;
Thi; was to some extent, as I will show, the consequence of the&#13;
generalized e4istence of redundant protection, i.e., water in the tari'f.&#13;
This observation, coupled with the relatively high value of the real exchange&#13;
rate makes it very doubtful to assert that-t-his initial move had any&#13;
significant iripact on competitive imports, and therefore on domestic producers&#13;
of protected goods. In any case, this was the first but also the last&#13;
,unexpected moye.* Afte'r this the government moved extremelyt.cautiously. .&#13;
:Up t.o,December: 1978 - more than 'two2-years after the first tariff -&#13;
reform- severaL_.part,i.al_tariff changes took place.  These reforms were-&#13;
negoLiated 'directly rb:y,the Secr,tary of Cominerce'with representatives-of.&#13;
differenlt industries.  My own estimates,' and what I have been told of how-&#13;
1/  Also, the nexc section will show that import licenses were never totally&#13;
dissmantled.&#13;
2/  Berlinski (1978) for some estimates.&#13;
3/  This initial tariff reform was not accompanied by any major move of&#13;
lifting very protective quantitative restrictions.&#13;
4! The participatisn rate increaied from 2.1% in 1976 to 3.3% in 1977.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
these negotiations took place, show that the net result of all these partial&#13;
tariff reforms was a reduction in the degree of redundant protection.&#13;
The Secrctary of Commerce used these partial tariff reforms to put&#13;
pressures on protected entrepreneurs to limit price increases, and tar;ff&#13;
reductions were negotiated with this objective in mind. This was a sig.-.L&#13;
showing that thc tariff was being used as a stabilization instrument. The&#13;
result of these numerous partial tariff negotiations was not only a reduction&#13;
in the margins of tariff redundancy, but also an increase in the variance of&#13;
the legal tariff structure.&#13;
As to the quantitative estimates backing my assertions, I have&#13;
measuired elsewhere the average tariff redundancy. 1/   Table 6 reproduces some&#13;
of my earlier findings.   These estimates compare legal tariff structures with&#13;
the percentage price differentials between domestically produced and foreign&#13;
CIF prices.  The price differentials were estimated for February of 1977.     The&#13;
legaL tariff structures correspond to October 1976 (before tariff reforms had&#13;
started) and December 1977 (after the Secretary of Commerce had completed the&#13;
bulk of partial tariff reforms).   These estimates show that on average the&#13;
rati'o of,legal tnriffs to price,di1ferent-ia'Is'declined from 2.5 to 1.4 betw,een,&#13;
October, 1976 and.December 1?7-7. 2&#13;
1/  Nogu6s, 1 9 1,8).&#13;
2/  Legal tariffs and price differeni:al's `are' weighed by gross value of&#13;
production.  The reader might be puzzled. b'y the relatively low level, of&#13;
protection that comes from the estimates,of price differentials., A.couple&#13;
of comrnents are in order.  First, th'e i:high' real exchange rate during 1977&#13;
reduced these differentials.   Also, as argued, the severe wage controls in,&#13;
effect at that time kept the domestic price level relatively'low. These,&#13;
comments imply that in a less controlled environment, price differentials&#13;
might have been higher and, therefore,'ou'r estimates of water in the&#13;
tariff would have been lower.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Also, the rank correlation coefficient between price differentials&#13;
and legal tarifis observed in October 1976 was -6%. If, ir.stead, price&#13;
differentials are compared with the structure of legal tariffs of December,&#13;
1977, the correlation coefficient takes a value of 56Z. 1/ Clear1y,&#13;
therefore, the structure of legal tariffs moved more in line with the&#13;
structure of relative prices observed in a set of industries producing goods&#13;
that were at that time protected from international competition.    Because the&#13;
variability _f price differentials was initially higher than the variability&#13;
of the tariff structure, the implementatiorn of partial tariff reforms implied&#13;
an increase in the variability of legal tariffs. Therefore, the role&#13;
attributed to tariff policies during the first two and a half years of&#13;
military government were quite different from the role of resource allocation&#13;
and import competition that economists usually attribute to them.&#13;
In practice, it took nearly three years for the economic team to&#13;
formulate and implement a relatively more consistent tariff policy.    Such a&#13;
policy was announced in December 1978.   Several characteristics of the reform&#13;
should be stressed. First, this was a gradual preannounced quarterly&#13;
reduction of-legal tar'if'fs to be implemented.during five years, i.e.v-wel;&#13;
after'the government :'iactuiIIy starting the refo'irmwas scheduled at tha't c7ime,&#13;
to-end its term.- Also,;the 'rates of tariff ,reductions were-initially.low, and&amp;&#13;
accelerated    in the la"st years.  Table 7 sho,w's 'tihe structure of legal tariffs&#13;
prevailing at the beginning of the program, and-the proportional reductions&#13;
scheduled to go into effect up to 1981 and from here to 1984.    It is clear&#13;
1/ Statistically significar.t with a 5% confidence level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
that if the tariff reform was going to be implemented, the burden of the&#13;
implementation costs was passed over to the next government.&#13;
In the second place, the target and interim tariff structure had an&#13;
escalation not very different from the historical one. Simulation analysis&#13;
presented in FIEL (1980) shows that with the target tariff structure, the&#13;
level of ERPs computed from legal tariff rates was high and variable. 1/&#13;
One important question to raise at this stage is why it took so long&#13;
to design the tariff program just described. One simple answer is that&#13;
policymulkers were concerned with the transition costs associated with the&#13;
implementation of import liberalization policies. This might be part of the&#13;
answer but is not compatible with policymaker's behavior in other areas.     An&#13;
alternative hypothesis and one that is more consistent with the nature of&#13;
policymaking that has been described, is that tariff policy was essentially&#13;
geared by anti-inflation objectives.   In fact this role was legally built into&#13;
tariff policy onfy four days after the preannounced tariff schedule was&#13;
implementedl   In fact, Resolution 6/79 of the Ministry on Economy gave power&#13;
to the Secretary of Commerce to apply tariff reductions on products whose&#13;
monthly rate of price increase' exceeded.the- preannounced rate of devaluation.&#13;
Fol'lowing the guidelines of 'this',;res lution numerous tariff,&#13;
reductions were implemented.   This obviouslyj,exacerbated entrepreneurs, at a&#13;
time'when, because of the overvaluati'on of'tRe peso, conmpetitive imports;vwere&#13;
beginning to growvrapidly.   Even though)import%,v.introduced as a consequence of&#13;
the application of Resolution 6 v-re not of magnitude, the associated uncer-&#13;
1/ These estimates for 45 manufacturing sectors show a simple average ERP of&#13;
432:.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
tainties accompanying these tariff redjctions must have produced negative&#13;
economic effects. The uncertainty came 3imply from the fact that after&#13;
Resolution 6, the confidence of the entrepreneurs on the extent to which the&#13;
preannounced tariff schedule was going to apply to their productive process&#13;
had been severely reduced.&#13;
The tariff was also thought as an instrument to foster investment&#13;
and technological change.   Here there are two pieces of evidence.    First, in&#13;
the preliminary remarks of Resolution 1634/78 that implemented the program of&#13;
quarterly tarif'f reductions, it is said that "...as an ezception, and wiLh the&#13;
objective of facilitating the acquisition of industrial equipment, capital&#13;
goods imports not domestically produced will be allowed duty free during&#13;
1979." 1/&#13;
Second, tariff protection to domestic producers of capital goods was&#13;
drastically chtinged four months after the policy of preannounced tariff reduc-&#13;
tions had started. 2/   The new tariffs applied on these goods was equal to the&#13;
one that had initially been scheduled to go into effect in January 1984.&#13;
Given that the rest of the tariff program remained unchanged, and that as we&#13;
shall see the basic metals industries continiued to be highly protected, this&#13;
policy shift icmplied a drast'i'c and unexpected reduction of effectiyeprotec--&#13;
-tion to producers of these-goods. 3/&#13;

(1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reductions when it: was first implemented, this lack of stability uf import&#13;
policies, associated with the inappropriate roles assigned to the tariff in&#13;
general, and in particular its anti-inflationary objectives, must have&#13;
affected seriously the credibility of the whole program. The growing&#13;
overvaluation of the domestic currency that was taking place must have&#13;
reinforced agents' expectations that the whole economic prograrm was going to&#13;
be running into incressing difficulties.&#13;
The extent .o which tariff redundancy affected the behavior of&#13;
domestic prices in late 1979 and 1980 cannot be accurately assessed from this&#13;
data. Thie evidence suggests that in some cases this might have provided at&#13;
least part of the explanation of price divergence in Argentina. 1/&#13;
Finally, it is of interest to note that the failure to dismantle&#13;
some signiEicant QRs during the liberalization attempt also helps to explain&#13;
the lack of convergence of docaestic price changes to international inflation&#13;
plus devaluation. This will be discussed more carefully in the next section,&#13;
where r take up some political-economy considerations.&#13;
VI.i Some Political-Economy Considerations&#13;
The earlier sections have attempted to tackle with one of the-&#13;
traditional tasks of economists:   i.e. to analyze the appropriateness of&#13;
economic policies.  But societies do not determine their policie-s by reference-&#13;
ta the costs and-Ibenefits that have convinced many economists.  Trade and&#13;
exchange rate poLicies are the result of the _underlying political&#13;
institutional characteristics of societies.&#13;
1/ See MHichinea (1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In this section I stress some issues of the political-economy of&#13;
trade and exchange rate policies. Point I calls attention to the fact' that&#13;
traditionally in Argentina exchange rate policies have been shaped by income-&#13;
distribution effects.  This is in sharp con-rasE to the role that the exchange&#13;
rate plays in monetary and neoclassical models. These models, it has been&#13;
argued, are the ones that policymakers had in their minds during 1976-1981.&#13;
The point here is to emphasize that des?ite the very different roles that the&#13;
exchange rate plays in these abstract models, there has been a pervasive&#13;
tendency of the policy decision-mechanism to use the exchang',-  . as anti-&#13;
inflation instrument.  The lesron to extrect from this is clear an'd&#13;
straightforward:  until we are not sure that t-. political-economy understands&#13;
the central role that the excnange rare and the tariff plays in the long-run&#13;
resource allocation characteristics of the economy, there will be a real&#13;
danger of implementing trade liberalization policies in an inflationary&#13;
economy.  Indend, the Argentine experience suggests thit for policymakers&#13;
these instruments might be used sooner or later for stabilization purposes&#13;
with costly consequences.&#13;
-       A second consideration refers to the fact that traditionally,-dif-&#13;
ferent government- agencxtes manage -different .trade instruments. - But because of-&#13;
the nature and relative importance of different controls, some goveriment&#13;
agenc'ies - che -fol'ovews .-'adjust. the iitriument'sl they'control- to cope -wit:h,&#13;
the effects of firianacial and exchange rate policie's implemented'by the leeXding&#13;
agencies. This agency segment&amp;tion was not changed during the period under -&#13;
study and because of this, inter-agency disputes developed. This argum:La_ is-&#13;
developed in point. 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The role of the military and the economic interest they held as&#13;
ovners of very inefficient and key industrial sectors producing intermediate&#13;
goods mwles it quite unlikely that governments under their influence w.11&#13;
..ctempt Across-the-board liberalizatioo poLicies. Point 3 argues that the&#13;
made-tc-measure protection to the military-industrial complex during this&#13;
period is clear evidence on this hypothesis.&#13;
The final point stresses the importance tna, new institutions are&#13;
expected to play when policy reform3 in effect give competitive forces a&#13;
greater role in the resource allocation process.&#13;
1. Exchange rate views and policies&#13;
Many acholars have concluded that irgentir.a is a sectoralized&#13;
society. 1/ A Lalor charac.erization of this sectoralization would include s&#13;
rural-jrban d;.chotomy. A summary view of the underlying political-economy&#13;
concludes that because Argentina is a resource-rich country, it is reasoniable&#13;
to redistribute income from the rural to the growing urban sector., Also,&#13;
because land o-wnership is very concentrated,. such a redistribution is&#13;
eq u i1 b le.-&#13;
In this irt..r-sectoral struggle, some' powerful urban groups have&#13;
shown.great1p6iiticsl ability to organz       hemselves.  These groups which&#13;
could be classified as the winners fr r the distorted ecoAomy would include a&#13;
handful of strong Rnd powerful labor unions on the one hand, and a few-mono-&#13;
1/  See among others, Brodershon (1963), Canitrot (1979), Di Tella (1983), an&#13;
MalLon &amp; Sourrouille (1973). Political scientists have analyzed some&#13;
aspects of the dynamics of Arguntine sectoralization.    See, for example,&#13;
Wynia (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
polistic manufacturing encerprises producing the bulk of protected&#13;
manufacturing output on the other.&#13;
The effectiveness of these urban groups has been such that, in fact,&#13;
they have conme to power on many occasions.   As a consequence, the government&#13;
has many times identified the national interest with sectoral interests to an&#13;
extent that must be quite unparalleled in other countries. 1/&#13;
Many economists have abstracted from this political economy when&#13;
constructing their models.   Among these, those including an analysis of the&#13;
income distribution effects of exchznge rate policies are important for under-&#13;
standing sor  of the pressures that policymakers might face when designing&#13;
their policies.   The best-known and most influential theoretical construct of&#13;
the eich_,ge rate-income distribution-output nexus has been worked out by Dlaz&#13;
Alejandro (1965).   In one of his influential works on the Argentine economy he&#13;
concludes that "...by introducing explicitly income redistribution considera-&#13;
tions into devaluation theory, it has been possible to view devaluation as&#13;
just another weapon in the struggle of different sectors in the economy for&#13;
larger shares in the national income."&#13;
-    - ~ This"''cnclusion &amp;omes from th  fac&amp;-that the price of food&#13;
Argentina's exportable - faced by urban workers is tied to the level of the&#13;
exchange' rate. '.'MA-so, the demand for urban iridustrial products;' which' because&#13;
of the very high protection they enjoy can be,tireated as non-tradables;,;is -&#13;
positively reLated to the real wage.   In this'contex. a devaluation by&#13;
increasing the price of food reduces real wages, and because the price'&#13;
elasticity of food demand is low, the devaluation also reduces aggregate&#13;
1! Di Tella (1983).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
demand for industrial products and, therefore, urban employment. It is&#13;
usually assumed that the rural sector responds slowly to price incentives.     In&#13;
these circutmstances, it is also possible for a devaluation to trigger&#13;
recession.&#13;
It is reasonable to quarrel with each one of the assumptions that&#13;
are necessary for this result to hold true, but such an exercise escapes the&#13;
objective of this paper.   On the other hand, these n,odels show the economic&#13;
logic behind some characteristics of the Argentine political-economy that help&#13;
to explain why a devaluation can be strongly resisted by policymakers. 1/     Ir&#13;
fact, Diaz Alejandro's exchange rate model has been used to interpret economic&#13;
policies and consequences of the 1973-1976 Peronist government. 2/&#13;
A major and persistent shortcoming of the Argentine policy decision&#13;
mechanism is that few policymakers believe that in the long-run the exchange&#13;
rate does not determine income distribution, and that in the short-run it is&#13;
an inappropriatp instrument for this purpose and for stabilization objectives&#13;
as well.&#13;
Thus, the-natural tendency of the political economy has been to fix&#13;
the exchangeirate and overvalue the&amp;domest;dc, currency.  This tendencyis.rein-&#13;
forced by the strong inflationary bias of the economy and the temptation-which&#13;
ari5es in suc-h"'circumstances to contrqol,bthe&gt;tinfl iationary process by whatever&#13;
policy instruments :are deemed appropri'ate  ''including exchange rate pplic'ies;&#13;
1/  To be sure Diaz Alejandro policy recommendations were to "...divorce&#13;
exchange rates and other relative prices as much as possible from the&#13;
determination of income distribution..." (1965, p.192).&#13;
2/ See Canitrot (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
During the years of the military government, exchange rate policies&#13;
find their theoretical backgrounds in the "monetary approach to the balance of&#13;
payments."  In the recent literature, this point has been stressed by Machinea&#13;
(1983), and FernAndez (1985).&#13;
This approach is based on a highly aggregative model that focuses&#13;
attention on the balance of payments adjustment process of an open economy&#13;
under fixed exchange rate policies.   The model does not distinguish between&#13;
consumer groups nor between economic sectors and, therefore, income distribu-&#13;
tion considerations are omitted from the analysis.   Also, because these models&#13;
assume a competitive neoclassical mechanism to be working, full employment is&#13;
guaranteed, and thus output effects are usually excluded from the analysis.&#13;
Because of these differences, monetary models stand in sharp contrast to&#13;
Keynesian constructs such as the one developed by Dlaz Alejandro.&#13;
Paradoxically, because of the fact that the inflationary trend of&#13;
the economy had not vanished, one can also rationalize the adoption of a&#13;
preannounced exchange rate policy as an anti-inflation instrument through an&#13;
attempt to influence expectations.   In fact, Rodriguez (1979) developed-a&#13;
-tGbr'ei- 1' del'howin     4                      o   -&#13;
stylized theoreticai model'showing how thead'justment'process associated vith&#13;
preannounced exchange rate could work.&#13;
LInft;conclusion, the Argentine'exp`eri'ence shows that its persistent-&#13;
inflation' has tempted policymakers of different poiitical regimes-and'holding&#13;
different economic views to use the exchange rate as a    stabilizing instru-&#13;
ment. But "realistic" exchange rate policies are key to a successfiil"tra'de&#13;
1/  Fernandez (1985) has asserted that this model "... can be considered a&#13;
very close approximation of what the economic team might have had in mind&#13;
at the time of announcing the devaluation schedule."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
liberalization attempt. Thus, unless the natural tendency of policymaking is&#13;
modified, ancd/or the inflation rate is significantly reduced, the Argentine&#13;
experience shows that a liberalization attempt in an inflatic.nary economy&#13;
might fail not because of the inflation per se, but because of the natural&#13;
tendency of the policy decision mechanism to misuse policy instruments for&#13;
stabilization purposes.&#13;
2. Policy segmentation, administrative rules and inter-agency disputes&#13;
The Central Bank is probably the most powerful governmental office&#13;
in Argentina.  Su!ch power comes from the crucial role it has historically&#13;
played in implementing economic policies.   Such economic policies have&#13;
traditionally been based on the importance of the governmaent for determining&#13;
the allocation of resources.  In this context, the Central Bank has played a&#13;
key role in controlling:  a) the exchange rate; b) international payments; c)&#13;
nominal interest rates; and d) credit allocation.   Control brings power, and&#13;
those exercised by the Central Bank are key to explaining historical economic&#13;
developments of the Argentine economy.&#13;
But^because these cbntrols are not-always suEficient to achievle&#13;
balance of payments objectives, other governmental offices are pushed to&#13;
adjust' tTheinstiuments th y'contro  l Thih'eha'sbeen the case, for examfiple,&#13;
with the Secretary of Commerce.             h  past when the country payment-s.,&#13;
problems worsened this government -off;ice increased trade barriers by:  a)&#13;
prohibi'ting specific imports, b) raising"tariffs, c) introducing import&#13;
licenses, and quotas, etc.  It is important to stress that this behavior is&#13;
not constrained by rules. This can be most clearly appreciated from quoting&#13;
the first article of the Argentine trade law-(20545): "... protection of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
workers and national output includes tariff and fiscal procedures whose aim is&#13;
to strengthen the output of enterprises of nationals with the objectives of:&#13;
finishing with the cultural, technological and economic dependence of the&#13;
country; seeking autarky in the production of strategic and/or fundamental&#13;
goods and services ..., and to assure a supply of goods that would guarantee&#13;
an adequate standard of living to the Argentine nation."    The statement shows&#13;
quite clearly the nationalistic spirit that guides the application of trade&#13;
policies.&#13;
An important change of this policy segmentation among government&#13;
offices occurred as a result of the policy reforms.   This time policy behavior&#13;
of the Secretary of Commerce was constrained by the new trade rules.    Nca-&#13;
tariff barriers were not allowed to be changed, and the path of the tariff&#13;
structure had been preannounced.&#13;
But because of the low real exchange rate and resulting surge of&#13;
import penetration, the Secretary of Commerce received increasing&#13;
protectionist requests.   Initially, the reaction was for this Secretary to&#13;
favor a real devaluation. The most important piece of evidence that this&#13;
SecretariatfJpdrepared"for argui'ng in fivor ofrthis policy was purchisings.power:&#13;
parity *,PPP') estimates' of the exchange6'ra'te.&#13;
-      A ;~' h-What could'have these6estimates shown?  Table.8 shows one'amongtheW,'-vv&#13;
sets of'PPP exchange rate series that can eventually be constructed-.; Heee I&#13;
take,.1978 as the base period and compute"m6rnth,ly PPP estimates by-using&#13;
domestic-and U.S. WPI.   The estimates s.how that-starting in.January .1979 the&#13;
domestic currency followed an appreciating trend, and in December 1980, the&#13;
PPP exclhange rate was 81% higher than the official exchange rate.' Had we&#13;
chosen ainother reasonable base period the discrepancy would have been higher,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
simply because in earlier years high export barriers and severe restrictions&#13;
on capital flows were in effect, and the equilibrium exchange rate was higher&#13;
than the 1978 rate. 1/ Clearly, the economic minister had to decide between a&#13;
devaluation or a continuation of policies.   His decision was to persist with&#13;
the Central Bank policies.   Inter--agency disputes continued, but became&#13;
irrelevant after this decision had been made.&#13;
Because devaluation was resisted, the Secretary of Conmnerce avoided&#13;
the constrained behavior implicit in a program of preannounced tariff&#13;
reductions and began granting "import relief" by raising official prices and&#13;
imposing anti-dumping and countervailing duties. Also, a 15Z across-the-board&#13;
countervailing tariff on imports from Brazil was imposed.    Finally, increased&#13;
export subsidies to different industries including beef were grantedl&#13;
In this regard the trade liberalization attempt made even more&#13;
inappropriate the trade lesson given by the traditional trade policy&#13;
mechanism. The experiment taught that countervailing and anti-dumping duties&#13;
could be usedi for granting protection.&#13;
Several other changes implied important departures from traditional&#13;
bureaucratic behav-ior and led to other' iner agency disputes.   For example,&#13;
traditionally, as the budget deficit grows, th'e Secretary of Finance raises&#13;
export tatx rates.  But this behaviraii-:hot permitted under the new&#13;
rules of the gae8.  Under these condiation-s the growing deficit which was&#13;
taking place wa's viewed as a threat-to"th'e instability of preannounced&#13;
exchange rate policies and more generaLly of the new economic program.     As a&#13;
I/  For example 1969.  See Nogues (1985) for jjustification of this base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
consequence, inter-agency disputes between the Central Bank and the Secretary&#13;
of Finance developed. These are referred to in Arriaz6 (1983).&#13;
I have already suggested that given the problems associated with the&#13;
sluggishness of the commodity price arbitrage process, which in turn could be&#13;
attributed to some extent to characteristics of import policies, the&#13;
underlying model behind preannounced exchange rate policies could not work in&#13;
practice.  But even if these problems had not been present, the underlying&#13;
model required a great deal of coordination among government agencies thst&#13;
were managing different instruments. This was not the case in the period&#13;
under study.&#13;
It is important to emphasize a final point. There is unanimous&#13;
agreemen: and abundant evidence that the military government was dictatorial and&#13;
socially repressive.  The dictatorial description also characterized the&#13;
economic policy decision mechanism.   Economic policies were designed by a&#13;
handful of persons - not more than five - which held absolute power and who&#13;
were not prepared to discuss and hear criticism to their policies either from&#13;
inside or outside the government.&#13;
Itiis reasonable to hypothesize that-;the economic disequilibrium&#13;
into which the-economy was put during 1980 could not have occurred irn a-mor.*&#13;
democratLc d'eisiin-making, process.  In --surch] an"'environment, .I hypothesize,-,&#13;

the social te nsions that developed from'-''the inappropriateness of the exchenge&#13;
rate and other distortion.sry policies w;ould have2been given a higher weight,&#13;
and probably corrective actions would have bee'n taken sooner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. Trade liberalization and the military industrial complex&#13;
In Argentina, the military own the bulk of output produced by the&#13;
steel industry. Because of its economic importance and the strong&#13;
interrelationship it has with other sectors, the efficiency with which this&#13;
industry operates determines to a great extent the competitiveness of other&#13;
sectors.  Unfortunately, this industry in Argentina can be characterized as an&#13;
inefficient protected monopoly.&#13;
Th.e steel market is shared by two enterprises: SOMISA (Sociedad&#13;
Mixta Siderorgica Ar,entina), and PROPULSORA.    The first is owned by the&#13;
military and is in practice administered by DIRECCION GENERAL DE FABRICACIONES&#13;
MILITARES (DCFM). PROPULSORA is owned by an Italian group: TECHINT.&#13;
During several years SOHISA was the sole producer of basic metal&#13;
products of iron and steel and grew thanks to a myriad of both open and hidden&#13;
subsidies.  After ten years of negotiating with the military, PROPULSORA began&#13;
in the early 70s producing coils and other steel products for the domestic&#13;
market.   Since then, legal barriers created by numerous decrees have served to&#13;
eliminate potential competition from domestic output.&#13;
*~~~ i,I                   it.,I,  &#13;
'Around,the same time that PROPULSORA)started its operations, import&#13;
licenses on the products produced by these enterprises became mandatory.&#13;
-According to Decrees 4 and 37 of 1968andi 197 0j'timport licenses will he&#13;
granted when domestic output "... does not-covrer domestic demand ...     " These&#13;
licenses are administered by DCFH.   Therefore, the market is completely&#13;
segmented, and no other enterprise has been able to produce at a significant&#13;
scale the most important products elaborated by SOMISA and PROPULSORA.     This&#13;
market: can very well be defined as a "sanctuary of protection."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In 1980, of the toCdl value of intermediate steel products imported,&#13;
52% entered the country with a license. Only one ten-digit Brussels Trade&#13;
Nomenclature (WTN) position (coilsi accounted for 64% of licensed imports, and&#13;
3 BTN positions accounted for 90%. SOMISA and PROPULSORA actually imported&#13;
64% of these licensed imports.&#13;
Not only are licensed imports highly concentrated, but their&#13;
associated rents are apparently quite significant. For example, in 1977&#13;
domestic ex-factory prices of coils exceeded international CIF prices by&#13;
62%. In late 1980, the Argentine domestic price exceeded the international&#13;
price by more than 200% (Table 9).   The domestic enterprises were, therefore,&#13;
collecting the bulk of the rents associated with the licenses they themselves&#13;
were managing.&#13;
Finally, according to the most recent ERP's estimates, the basic&#13;
metal industry was receiving in 1977 above average rates of protection (Nogues&#13;
1978).  For example, the basic industries of rion-ferrous metals (SIC 372) and&#13;
iron and steel (SIC 371) had corresponding weighted average estimates of ERP's&#13;
of 88% and 85% respectively.  They ranked secona and third among fifteen&#13;
three-digit SIC id4-s'Frites. 1/&#13;
5 ' ' Suimming up,'a haridful of 'enterprises in the Argentine'basic metal&#13;
in'dbustry-are completely'protected from domest-idccompetition by legal .barriers -&#13;
arid' from foreign cdimpeti:ion by import licenses-. -Issues surrounding these&#13;
enterprises are assessed by zhe military an'd have been out of the influence of&#13;
economic ministers.  In effect during the military government, the miLitary&#13;
1/ The non-ferrous basic metal industry is essentially aluminum, which is&#13;
also protected with import licenses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reserved for themselves an economic instrument - licenses - to protect their&#13;
industry. Recall, that during 1979 and 1980 protection to all other import&#13;
substitute industries was granted exclusively thtough tariffs.&#13;
For our purposes, it is also important to stress that in a&#13;
liberaliza:ion process, the steel industry was going to be affected, even if&#13;
it could escape the tariff rule that had been set for the other import-&#13;
subtituting industries. This is because demand for its products come from&#13;
other protected industries such as cars and capital goods that were in all&#13;
likelihood going to be hurt by lower import barriers. 1/ Thus, in the long&#13;
run, and in an across the board liberalization process, it appears that the&#13;
military industrial complex had little chance of sur:iving unless its managers&#13;
showed the capacity to adjust to import competition. The evidence suggests&#13;
that they were not willing to confront this challenge. The econem.1c interests&#13;
of the political power structure were not compatible with import l;.beraliza-&#13;
t;on policies.&#13;
4. Role of Institutions&#13;
The qcuote in point, 2 of this-' sectiohfnfrom the Argentine trade law&#13;
shows"'quite c early that economic'self-'skifficien y has been a major&#13;
ideoldgi'cal forcgof the Argentine economic decision mechanism.    Policy&#13;
reforms that seek- to increase the''role of competi'tive forces and international&#13;
economic interdependence must include a-major attempt to change the nature of&#13;
1/  This might be one reason explaining why the car industry was excluded from&#13;
the tariff program and, in fact, received above average protection during&#13;
the military government. See FIEL (1980) for a description of import&#13;
-policies protecting the car industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Lhe economic decision mechanism, i.e., to create new institutions. 1/ At this&#13;
stage I will suggest the importance of two characteristics that should&#13;
accompany a major shift in trade policies.&#13;
The first is obvious, and probably b_cause of this it is&#13;
important. The new decision mechanism must have a clear understanding of the&#13;
role played by different policy instruments, particularly in regard to their&#13;
approoriateness for resource allocation, as well as income distribution and&#13;
stabilization objectives. The paper has offered evidence showing that the&#13;
economic cabinet of the military government did not show a clear understanding&#13;
of the role played by the major policy instruments under their control.&#13;
The second suggestion is to balance the power held by differ?nt&#13;
groups participating in the policy decision mechanism.    It is a balanced and&#13;
more democratic mechanism - one where corsumers', exporters' and importers'&#13;
interests have approximately similar weig!its - that is expected to result in a&#13;
long lasting liberalization. The major risk of not attempting to introduce&#13;
these changes is that when bad times reappear, policy reforms will be&#13;
concluded and protectionist policies reintroduced.&#13;
Attempting to construct a balancedjpolicy decision mechanism is a&#13;
major challenge which has rot been taken upf'or.decades.    Obviously it is not&#13;
expec.ed for a repressive military dictatorship to do this anyhow.    This, L&#13;
'ypothesize, explains that when internationa-l`payments problems reappeared&#13;
during 1981-82, ic proved easy and politically costless to close the&#13;
economy. This wns done by another military government.&#13;
1/  Hamilton defines institution as "...connotes a way of thought or action of&#13;
some prevalence and permanence, which is embedded in the habits of a group&#13;
or the customs of a people" (Hamilton, 1936, p. 84).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VII. Final Remark&#13;
This paper has analyzed the nature of economic controls that were&#13;
imposed by Argentina's military government between 1976 and 1981. Behind&#13;
these controls was an attempt to bring down the inflation rate. But che&#13;
government was unable to balance the budget, and as a consequence, the&#13;
fundamental cause of the inflation pcoblem remained present.&#13;
Tle first characteristic of controls studied in this paper was their&#13;
instability. Because of this, the absolute and relative prices of macro&#13;
variables such as real wages, real interest rates and the real exchange rate&#13;
fluctuated significautly.&#13;
A second characteristir refers to the severity of the distortions&#13;
which these controls created. For example, there does not appear to be in the&#13;
post-World War [I history of Argentina, nor of other developing countries,&#13;
fluctuations in real effective exchange rates as great as the one recorded for&#13;
Argentina.&#13;
T'he nature of these policy-induced distortions was such, that they&#13;
could only be sustained with important capital inflows. Therefore, the&#13;
severity of the controls-lasted as long--as the''international-financial&#13;
community supplied the necessary financial resources.    Unfort"unately, this&#13;
pro'cess went too far, and by the time when policy reversals began to be&#13;
implemented, Argentina's foreign debt h'd .ncre'ased to historical high'levels,&#13;
'i.e., a level that will be a major economic problem for years to come.&#13;
T  this environment, policie- resulting in reductions of import&#13;
barriers were introduced. But given the severity of the macro-economy&#13;
disequilibrium, these policies could not be sustained.     In any case, I have&#13;
stressed that these policies were also ts     great extent driven by anti-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
inflation objectives. I have also argued that the long-run economic interest&#13;
of those who held effective political control at that time were not compztiZIe&#13;
with trade liberalization policies. The military industrial complex simply&#13;
escaped the trade policy rules that were imposed on other tradeable sectors.&#13;

            The nature of Argentina's policy
            reforms during 1976-1981
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Much of the existing literature on
            Argentina has emphasized the liberal nature of the economic
            reforms introduced during 1972-81. A major purpose of this
            paper is to present evidence that contradicts this
            interpretation. In particular, it emphasizes the
            implementation of pervasive government controls and argues
            that the intensity and instability of these controls
            resulted in historically high, short run fluctuations of
            relative prices for commodities and factors.
