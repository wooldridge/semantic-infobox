recommendations for course correction. The         representatives and outside partners, the Mid-&#13;
Mid-Term Review Panel began its works in           Term Review Panel prepared a Consultation&#13;
January 2014 and focused on the following:         Draft Final Report. A number of preliminary&#13;
                                                   comments, in particular from the Consortium&#13;

   goals and strategies in supporting the          were issued prior to the development of the&#13;

initial comments from the Consortium Board           with potential for very high payback. The list is&#13;
have now been superseded by the joint                by no means definitive- but this level of&#13;
response and comments from the Consortium            prioritization is needed to sharpen focus and&#13;
and Centers on the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s nine                      impact.&#13;
Recommendations presented in the Draft.              1. Nutrition. All CGIAR food crop and&#13;
Several donors and other stakeholders also               livestock research should include&#13;
provided comments and suggestions                        nutritional improvement as an embedded&#13;
regarding the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s draft findings and                 objective, with a specific focus on&#13;
recommendations (see Supplementary                       reducing stunting and related impacts&#13;
Appendix). The Panel has taken these inputs              based on local needs and conditions.&#13;
into consideration in this report, particularly in   2. Degraded Lands. Research should focus&#13;
order to improve clarity of conclusions and              on increasing sustainable agricultural&#13;
recommendations. The Panel proposes the                  productivity or healthy agro-ecosystems&#13;
following key recommendations.                           for the worldâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural degraded&#13;
                                                         arable land.&#13;
1. Develop a clear CGIAR Vision and Mission          3. Reduce Food systems waste. Research&#13;
A clear and focused vision and mission should            should focus on reducing food system&#13;
be developed to guide the decisions on priority          waste by considering the food value chain,&#13;
research objectives, facilitate the                      as well as opportunities to use waste for&#13;
development of strategic approaches to                   other co-benefits related to sustainability&#13;
reaching those objectives, and provide                   and profitability â&#128;&#147; enhancing soil&#13;
adequately detailed expectations of results.             condition, energy generation, etc.&#13;
The Panel recommends that the vision for             4. Resilience. Recognizing that the poorest&#13;
CGIAR be oriented towards agricultural                   smallholder farmers are generally the&#13;
research required to meet immediate and                  most vulnerable and least resilient to&#13;
long-term nutrition needs and achieve                    shocks, agricultural research needs to be&#13;
equitable food security by 2030. Likewise, the           targeted to keep pace with the growing&#13;
Panel recommends that the CGIAR mission                  global, regional and local impacts of&#13;
should include how it will achieve these short           climate change, water shortages and&#13;
and long term societal challenges through its            other shocks.&#13;
mission statement â&#128;&#147; through its strengths as         5. Big data. Investing in open data&#13;
a global network; a network that harnesses               architectures, high performance&#13;
other relevant capabilities from organizations.          computing and visualization facilities and&#13;

2. Prioritize to achieve maximum impact with             relevance to CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s outcomes and its&#13;
    the least cost                                       aspiration to be a global leader of&#13;
A CGIAR task force should undertake a                    networks. CGIAR is well positioned to&#13;
systematic process of prioritization, with the           develop a global agri-informatics network&#13;
objective of providing a menu of options for             focused on â&#128;&#156;evidence based management&#13;
CGIAR and its partners to determine how they             of agro-ecosystemsâ&#128;&#157; by partnering with&#13;
can maximize impacts with the least costs for            like-minded regional and global networks&#13;
both upstream and downstream research.                   and organizations to leverage existing&#13;
This would assist donors in identifying where            infrastructure and capabilities, improve&#13;
they might achieve the largest benefits for the          the access and utility of agri-related data&#13;
least costs in addressing the drivers of food            and save significant resources.&#13;

prioritization of outcomes being sought and          the Board - limiting the number of members to&#13;
consequently the research and partnerships           ensure that it is manageable. This will&#13;
required to deliver against these. This will         inevitably lead to a constituency-based board.&#13;
enhance stakeholder confidence in that the           The Panel believes that the key stakeholders&#13;
limited financial resources are being used for       requiring representation on the CGIAR Board&#13;
the greatest impact, and that those resources        are the donors, CGIAR Centers, NARs,&#13;
are sufficient for achieving the research goals.     agricultural private sector representatives,&#13;
In this regard, it is timely to consider piloting,   civil society development organizations, and&#13;
within the next round of CGIAR Research              recipient countries. The ISPC Chair, who is&#13;
Program (CRP) proposals, a more open and             essentially the chief scientist of CGIAR, should&#13;
competitive platform to allow a non-Center to        be an ex-officio member of the Board.&#13;
lead on a proposal if it is uniquely qualified to&#13;
do so, and piloting a performance-based              Based on legal advice provided to the Panel, it&#13;
financing mechanism.                                 understands that the proposed Board could&#13;
                                                     operate with or without its own legal identity.&#13;
The preparation of the SRF must have&#13;
sufficient stakeholder participation to ensure       The Board should focus on high-level,&#13;
joint ownership of the final product. The            strategic issues, articulating accountabilities&#13;
process should take as much time as is               but allowing each Center and CRP to manage&#13;
required to get it right. The call for the second    the on-the-ground work of CGIAR, and the&#13;
round of CGIAR Research Program proposals            Boardâ&#128;&#153;s administrative unit to focus on day-to-&#13;
should only be issued after the Fund Council         day management issues, such as&#13;
is fully satisfied with the SRF, including an        administrative efficiencies, regulatory&#13;
assurance from CGIAR stakeholders that there         compliance, and reporting. High-level issues&#13;
is broad support.                                    for the Board are likely to include establishing&#13;
                                                     the overall strategy and principles that govern&#13;
4. Governance structure                              funding decisions; governance decisions, such&#13;
The Panel strongly recommends that a single          as appointing the Board and Board Committee&#13;
CGIAR Board be established to replace the            leadership; establishing policies for fiduciary&#13;
Fund Council and the Consortium Board and            and risk management and other key policy&#13;
be supported by one Administrative Unit,             elements of governance; management&#13;
replacing the Fund Office and Consortium             oversight; stakeholder participation; and&#13;
Office, with the aim of eliminating current          review and approval of funding proposals.&#13;
governance ambiguities, strengthening the&#13;
ability of CGIAR to deliver its mission of           The Panel considers that, in order to avoid&#13;
research and development impact, and                 perceived or real conflicts of interest, the&#13;
accelerating and scaling up solution-driven          Board Chair should represent the mission of&#13;
public-private collaborative partnerships.           the CGIAR partnership and therefore should&#13;
A number of comments on the Consultation             not represent a constituency. Further, it&#13;
Draft have urged caution, a slower pace, and         considers that the Board Chair should have&#13;
minor changes as being preferable to the             sufficient time to commit to that role to&#13;
major governance change that we have                 effectively lead the Board, which in addition to&#13;
proposed. We believe that those comments             chairing Board meetings, could include&#13;
seriously underestimate the urgency of the           serving as the principle spokesperson,&#13;
need for such change and the significant             advocate, and fundraiser for CGIAR and&#13;
problems that were identified in the evidence        leading the Boardâ&#128;&#153;s inter-sessional work.&#13;
that the Panel was able to review.&#13;
                                                     The Board should establish a donor council,&#13;
The proposed Board would need to adequately          which would advise and serve the Board, and&#13;
and effectively represent key stakeholders,          provide views of the broader CGIAR donor&#13;
with clarity on the rationale for inclusion of       base (e.g., regarding operations, fundraising,&#13;
stakeholders and the expectations of them.           etc.). The CGIAR Centers should establish an&#13;

The reform design retained four of its pre-          current Panel is to review how well these have&#13;
reform principles and introduced three new           or are working and how well they position the&#13;
principles.                                          CGIAR to meet the challenges of the future.&#13;
                                                     They include:&#13;
The first principle carried over from the â&#128;&#156;old       ï&#130;· Separation of funders from â&#128;&#156;doersâ&#128;&#157; (the&#13;
CGIARâ&#128;&#157; is maintaining donor sovereignty.                 Centers and CRPs and Consortium) - this&#13;
However at the same time the reform sought               is the most fundamental shift, resulting in&#13;
to improve harmonization among donors in                 a two-pillared governance structure. The&#13;
order to maximize pooled, fungible research              collective of funders as the Fund Council&#13;
funds. The original intent was that the CGIAR            has an arms-length working relationship&#13;
Fund would only finance agreed CRPs through              with Centers and CRPs, relying on the&#13;
two funding windows, one for unrestricted                Consortium (Board and CEO) to represent&#13;
(pooled) contributions (Window 1) to be                  the Centers interests at Fund Council&#13;
allocated to CRPs by the Fund Council and the            deliberations.&#13;
second (Window 2) for contributions targeting        ï&#130;· Harmonization - the governance changes&#13;
specific CRPs. This objective was not achieved           and a change management process were&#13;
since several donors want or need to also be             expected to stimulate a culture of&#13;
able to direct funding to Centers through the            collective action by funders and doers and&#13;
Fund, thus the establishment of a third pass-            improve efficiency and effectiveness.&#13;

reputation is built on its research excellence     are few metrics substantiating the cost&#13;
and rigor.                                         savings resulting from the reforms, and how&#13;

Some external reviews have considered that         system. There also appears to be little&#13;

review by the Fund Office of the responses of      that the reform process has not led to an&#13;
Centers to ISPC comments on CRP proposals          adequate agreement on accountabilities.&#13;
shows that the ISPC advice is generally acted&#13;
on (more so for the substantive                    4.3.5 Remaining needs for gender&#13;
recommendations and less so on                     commitments in research activities&#13;
recommendations regarding institutional            undertaken&#13;

But as is pointed out in the joint Center input    equity in the planning and conduct of research&#13;
to the Panel, â&#128;&#156;foresight studies, exploratory      activities, others have expressed that the&#13;
initiatives, novel discoveries are not now being   reforms have not resulted in the&#13;

view that some of the current modalities of        ISPC review of CRP extension proposals saw&#13;
executing the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s agenda erode their           little evidence that CRP proposals had really&#13;
capacity for global scientific leadership.â&#128;&#157; The    incorporated gender-linked constraints in the&#13;
Panel concurs with this view.                      research commissioned and concerns into the&#13;

uneven progress on efficiency. In its              frameworks is also inconsistent across the&#13;
submission to the Panel, one of the donors         CRPs. Discussion with senior HR staff of one&#13;

complimenting the progress made, noted that         speaks with multiple voices and messages are&#13;
â&#128;&#156;it was difficult to interpret from the extension   often inconsistent. There is no single voice for&#13;
proposals, how much strategic thinking had          CGIAR. Center DGs most often represent their&#13;
gone into the selection of partners in some         particular Center, not CGIAR, and not&#13;
CRPs. The quality of partnerships was another       surprising since they each answer to their own&#13;
area of concern. The CGIAR might not have a         Board and in many cases the Center brand is&#13;
strong comparative advantage in all desired         more effective at generating financial support&#13;
areas of research/activity but it has the           then the CGIAR brand. There is little incentive&#13;
potential to form effective partnerships with       for corporate coherence or strategic&#13;
leading organizations that provide                  messaging about the objectives of the reform&#13;
complementary capacities, thereby generating        by the Centers, the global challenges being&#13;
collaborative advantage. For most CRPs,             addressed or the solutions being provided to&#13;

In 2012 an SRF Action Plan provided                  not had an opportunity to review the latest&#13;
additional guidance on how to prioritize CRP         version of the SRF, the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s conclusion is&#13;
proposals and quantitatively measure                 that the risk is high that the final SRF may not&#13;

post-reform CGIAR governance have been                 (Consortium Office and Fund Office). This&#13;

&amp;#12;Appendix 2. Submission from the 15 CGIAR Centers to the MTR Panel&#13;
(Received August 16, 2014)&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The reform of the CGIAR that was initiated in 2008 was, by design, ambitious in its objectives and&#13;
was carried out without a structured change management program; rather, the reform followed from&#13;
an initial design template and then was adaptively managed while it was underway, primarily through&#13;
consultative processes between the new governance and management entities and the CGIAR&#13;
Centers. Of course, the reform and its design elements were based on considerable diagnostic&#13;
evidence of the strengths and weaknesses of the CGIAR. Consequently, the adaptive processes that&#13;
followed were guided by at least three main intentions of the reform:&#13;
(a) making the whole CGIAR system greater than the sum of its parts -- the creation of CRPs as a key&#13;
instrument for achieving this,&#13;
(b) a more compelling global agenda for the CGIAR that ends the mandate creep of the Centers,&#13;
inspire confidence among investors and help mobilize increased financial investments â&#128;&#147;a key&#13;
element of this was the Strategic Results Framework (SRF) with four strategic objectives, and&#13;
(c) simplification of the CGIAR system which had become enormously complex â&#128;&#147;but for which no&#13;
road map was created as implementation of the reform started. The adaptive process of the reform&#13;
referred to above continues and brings together the lessons of the first five years of the reform.&#13;
This note is a brief assessment, from a Center perspectives, of where the CGIAR is currently in the&#13;
change process, and what has been learned --in short what has worked well and what has not&#13;
worked so well.&#13;
&#13;
A. What has worked well&#13;
This starts with the overall objective of the reform, namely to transform the CGIAR from 15&#13;
autonomous international agricultural research centers into an integrated, highly responsive, and&#13;
learning system focused on major global challenges related to food and nutritional security, reducing&#13;
poverty and sustainable natural resource management. This overarching objective was intended to&#13;
make the whole CGIAR greater than the sum of its parts. There were two elements to this (a)&#13;
delivering greater synergy and impact from the combined research effort of the CGIAR and (b)&#13;
gaining greater efficiency and effectiveness organizationally from shared infrastructure and services&#13;
etc. The following are some examples of what has worked, identified by the Centers:&#13;
&#13;
   1. The CRP mechanism: Development of CRPs was a key element of system architecture and&#13;
      contributed to both (a) and (b) above, and embodied four principal design elements, namely:&#13;
&#13;
           a) The CRPs were the mechanism for achieving integration around a common research&#13;
              agenda defined at the CGIAR system level with the assumption that there would be&#13;
              progressive programmatic alignment within Centers themselves and supported by full&#13;
              W1/W2. However, there has a continuing reliance on an increasing share of bilateral&#13;
              funding.&#13;
&#13;
           b) A framework for accountability for development impacts would be developed with a&#13;
              focus on monitoring outcomes rather than outputs and where effective partnerships&#13;
              were a necessary element in achieving these impacts.&#13;
&#13;
           c) The CGIAR would continue to lead with high quality science but with the difficulty of&#13;
              balancing upstream research with the investment in innovation and delivery capacity&#13;
              needed to achieve downstream impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  43&#13;
&amp;#12;            d) There would be an organizational separation of â&#128;&#156;fundersâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;doersâ&#128;&#157; but with an&#13;
               inherent tension in who lead resource prioritization, particularly given the continuing&#13;
               dependence on bilateral funding reflecting the preference of many of the "funders".&#13;
In many ways this central CRP plank of the reform has been an extremely positive achievement. For&#13;
example, the CGIAR system has consolidated new areas of work in all of the four strategic objectives&#13;
of the SRF. There has also been a tangible increase in scientific collaboration across Centers as&#13;
evidenced by increased joint planning, implementation and publications. There has also been&#13;
pooling of different strengths of participating Centers around the common research agenda of&#13;
individual CRPs. CRP development has been an ongoing learning process and some challenges&#13;
relating to governance and transactions costs remain. One area of future work is to define areas&#13;
where cross CRP collaboration will achieve even greater efficiencies. At the same time, the CRPs&#13;
have led to improved conceptualization of how the CGIAR approaches delivery and impact, often&#13;
through greatly improved geographic alignment, and significantly deepened CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s capacity and&#13;
approaches to gender equity. Ongoing and planned evaluations of CRPs will provide excellent&#13;
opportunities to refine and improve the governance and efficiency of CRPs, and thereby Centers; the&#13;
CRPs have already been shown to be highly responsive to various reviews.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Creating the SRF: Although the first edition of the SRF was completed later than was&#13;
        desirable and with some inadequacies, it has served to advance the second intention of the&#13;
        reform --a more compelling global agenda for the CGIAR that reduces the mandate creep of&#13;
        the Centers, inspires confidence among investors and helps mobilize increased financial&#13;
        investments. Here too, much has been achieved:&#13;
&#13;
            a) The mandate creep: Mandate creep that plagued the CGIAR prior to the reform by&#13;
               dissipating efforts and violating principles of subsidiarity with partners has largely&#13;
               been arrested. The vast majority of CGIAR research efforts fit within the SRF and,&#13;
               more importantly, drive the current portfolio of CRP.&#13;
&#13;
            b) Increased funding: Funding to the CGIAR has doubled since the reform started,&#13;
               although there is continuing debate about attribution. This relates to whether the&#13;
               increase in funding came about as a result of the reform, and/or by the global food&#13;
               price crisis which struck the same year (2008), with continuing ripples since then.&#13;
               Whatever the cause, the CGIAR with a new SRF and portfolio of CRPs, was well&#13;
               positioned to address the attending anxiety about how the world will sustainably feed&#13;
               itself to the time of population stabilization in the 2050s, while also addressing&#13;
               poverty and climate change on a planet that some argue is reaching its ecological&#13;
               limits. The appropriate positioning of the CGIAR at that time was undoubtedly the&#13;
               result of the reform process.&#13;
&#13;
            c) The Windows: Importantly, the significant growth rate in the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s aggregate&#13;
               budget since 2008 has provided more opportunity for achieving impact. The&#13;
               combined and complementary funding model (W1/W2 and W3/Bilateral) is&#13;
               fundamentally sound and provides for CRP stability, growth, evolution and innovation.&#13;
               W1/W2 donors get effective leverage as W3/bilateral funds are mobilized to&#13;
               enhance delivery of CRPs. Conversely, given the (theoretical) stability of W1/W2&#13;
               funding to CRPs, Centers are in a good position to mobilize additional and&#13;
               complementary funding for the CRPs. There is thus a mutually reinforcing&#13;
               relationship between W1/W2 and W3/bilateral funding. Although there has been&#13;
               some tension among the various parts of the system on the matter of W3/bilateral&#13;
44&#13;
&amp;#12;                funding, Centers are firmly of the view that resource mobilization from that source for&#13;
                the CRPs, and the SRF more broadly, should be encouraged. However, Centers are&#13;
                also of the view that W1/W2 funding should represent a higher amount and&#13;
                proportion (growing to over 60%) of total funding, than is the case now, if system&#13;
                integrity is to be maintained into the future.&#13;
&#13;
    3. Partnership and gender higher up the agenda: The CGIAR has always been noted for&#13;
       extensive up and down stream partnerships, particularly with NARES in the developing&#13;
       countries. The advent of the CRP and the enhanced funding base have facilitated significant&#13;
       strengthening of these partnerships and the creation of new ones, for example, with&#13;
       specialized development organizations that will facilitate scaling and greater impact. These&#13;
       conditions have also facilitated stronger efforts to mainstream gender and advance this area&#13;
       of work where it belongs -higher up the agenda of the CGIAR and partners.&#13;
&#13;
    4. Prospect of more collective action: Although not yet paying many dividends to the reform,&#13;
       plans are being developed to capture organizational benefits in such areas as (a) shared&#13;
       services, (b) deliberate movement towards co-locating of staff across countries/regions, (c)&#13;
       managing security and related risks and building stronger communities of practice in&#13;
       capacity development, communications and knowledge management, among others. Of&#13;
       course, collective action of this sort is not new to the CGIAR; the Centers previously created&#13;
       CGNet and AIARC, among others, which have endured and served the CGIAR well. That track&#13;
       record has emboldened the Centers and created a commitment to doing more in this area in&#13;
       the future.&#13;
&#13;
B. What did not work so well&#13;
The above benefits of the CGIAR reform, however, have come with some costs associated with&#13;
differing interpretation of the Consortium Constitution and inadequate articulation of how the&#13;
expanded number of organizational parts should work. These in turn are manifested in governance&#13;
and operational difficulties and ever rising transactions costs. Some examples of these challenges&#13;
follow:&#13;
     1. The conceptual divide: There are differing interpretations of the Consortiumâ&#128;&#153;s Constitution&#13;
         which defines the relationship between the Consortium Board (CB)/Consortium Office (CO)&#13;
         and the Centers and guides operations. Centers believe that what they had signed up to was&#13;
         a sort of a â&#128;&#152;joint ventureâ&#128;&#153; in which they were an integral part of the Consortium. However,&#13;
         legal opinion given to the CO provides an interpretation that the Consortium is a separate&#13;
         and independent entity and does not include the members Centers (see attached). In this&#13;
         context then, the CGIAR Consortium of Agricultural Research Centers is a misnomer.&#13;
         Interestingly, however, the word consortium is derived from Latin and means â&#128;&#156;those with a&#13;
         shared fateâ&#128;&#157;. Under the interpretation above, while the Consortium consults its members&#13;
         and generally represents their views and interests, it need not do so as it has the liberty to&#13;
         act in its own right and to take positions that do not necessarily reflect that of the members.&#13;
&#13;
        In operational terms this interpretation, adhered to by the CB-CO, has at least two important&#13;
        implications:&#13;
            a) The ambiguity about whether the Centers are part of the Consortium or not and the&#13;
                uncertainty concerning the obligations in both directions have severely impeded the&#13;
                building of trust and cohesion between the Centers and the CB/CO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      45&#13;
&amp;#12;             b) It was envisaged that the CO would be a convener, facilitator, and advocate,&#13;
                providing intellectual support in areas such as the quality of CRP submissions.&#13;
                However, as a result of (a) above, different expectations have emerged between the&#13;
                Centers and the CO over its role as facilitator or regulator.&#13;
&#13;
     2.    The governance challenge: The reformed CGIAR consists of an enlarged number of system&#13;
          entities, namely the Fund Council (FC) and Fund office (FO), the Consortium CB and CO, the&#13;
          ISPC the IEA and the 15 Centers each with their own respective Boards. Inadequate&#13;
          articulation of guidelines on interoperability and operating procedures that clearly defined&#13;
          the roles and responsibilities of each of the entities, led to adaptive management that was&#13;
          described in the introductory section of this paper. Furthermore, lack of definition of what&#13;
          success actually looks like, with baselines and metrics of reform progress, have led to&#13;
          divergent views. This has also led to less than seamless relationships between the CB and&#13;
          the FC, the FO and the CO and between the CO and the Centers. But perhaps the greatest&#13;
          tension has been between the CO and Centers, especially in the area of governance and&#13;
          management of the CRPs. Some of the implications of this atmosphere are:&#13;
&#13;
             a) While lead Centers have been designated to lead the various CRPs, this role and&#13;
                particularly the lead Center Board governance responsibility, in relation to the CRP&#13;
                Advisory Committee/Panel/Board, is still uncertain terrain even after the&#13;
                dispensation of the recently concluded CRP Governance and Management review.&#13;
&#13;
             b) Leading or not, if the Centers are not part of the Consortium, then the Centers&#13;
                relationship with the CRPs may be regarded as just contractees of the Consortium&#13;
                rather than the joint owners of the programs they perceive themselves to be. This&#13;
                characterization seems fair given that all but fiduciary responsibility lies outside the&#13;
                Centers.&#13;
&#13;
             c) While the creation of the CRP mechanism must be regarded as a resounding success&#13;
                as explained at A.1 above, their operationalization, given the current architecture,&#13;
                has imposed very high transactions costs in both financial and senior scientist time.&#13;
                For example, each CRP has a program management committee with an average size&#13;
                of roughly 10 members thus engaging 150 people (15 CRP X 10 members) at the&#13;
                management level with statutory meeting roughly four times per year. In addition,&#13;
                each CRP has an advisory committee/panel/board of roughly 10 people each, thus&#13;
                engaging about another 150 people at the advisory/governance level, meeting on&#13;
                average twice per year. Furthermore, numerous science planning and coordination&#13;
                meetings at theme/flagship level are required within each CRP. This of course, is in&#13;
                addition to existing Center level boards and CO/CB processes in which Centers, CRP&#13;
                Directors and other science leaders are involved. While these operational modalities&#13;
                were required in the past, the question is, can we obtain similar benefits of an&#13;
                expanded research and development agenda, strengthened partnerships among&#13;
                Centers, expanded research and development partnerships beyond the CGIAR, etc. at&#13;
                a lower transaction cost?&#13;
&#13;
             d) Simplification of the CGIAR system: As indicated in the introduction of this paper,&#13;
                simplification of the CGIAR system was a key objective of the reform. Leading up to&#13;
                the reform, it was realized that the system had become inordinately complex and&#13;
&#13;
46&#13;
&amp;#12;               difficult to navigate by both those inside and outside the system. This of course&#13;
               militated against building research and development partnerships beyond the CGIAR,&#13;
               particularly the private sector, and bewildered potential new non-traditional donors.&#13;
               Most players in and outside the CGIAR will unfortunately agree that the system is&#13;
               every bit as complex, and perhaps even more so, than before the reform.&#13;
&#13;
   3. Science management: The CGIAR is about science for development and that is the basis on&#13;
      which its reputation was built. The reform then, included the search for more effective&#13;
      science leadership. In this regard the reformed CGIAR system faces a number of science&#13;
      challenges. Only three will be listed here. First is how to match the science aspirations of the&#13;
      CGIAR, namely being a leader in global agricultural and related research, with the evolving&#13;
      and complicated structure of CRPs and Centers management and governance within a&#13;
      geographically distributed system. There is an inherent rigidity to scientific research, given&#13;
      the human and infrastructural capacities needed in specific scientific areas and thus,&#13;
      evolving new science agendas require foresight tied to investment strategies, where such&#13;
      investments are often financially constrained under the budgetary systems put in place after&#13;
      the reform. Second, is how to balance the need for science and innovation addressing long&#13;
      term challenges with those that addressed immediate or short term development needs.&#13;
      The reform has resulted in a greatly expanded research agenda for the CGIAR and how to&#13;
      balance more upstream aspirations with more downstream relevance is an ongoing issue&#13;
      within a complex system. Third, and related to the previous point, is how to organize and&#13;
      manage science within an accountability framework focused on broad development&#13;
      objectives. Does this shift scientific incentives and priorities and how does the CGIAR&#13;
      manage the scope of research together with the necessary partnerships needed to respond&#13;
      under such an accountability framework?&#13;
&#13;
       Given the science challenges above, are the various CGIAR organs for science review&#13;
       providing the scientific leadership required, as well as direction on the institutional&#13;
       arrangements needed for innovative partnerships? The foresight studies, exploratory&#13;
       initiatives, novel discoveries are not now being sufficiently addressed. Science oversight is&#13;
       essentially focused on the CRPs; and yet science quality, new research capacities, and&#13;
       design of research programs are essentially managed by the Centers. Centers are of the&#13;
       view that some of the current modalities of executing the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s agenda erode their&#13;
       capacity for global scientific leadership.&#13;
&#13;
C. Way Forward&#13;
Centers believe that this is an opportune time to consolidate the gains of the CGIAR as indicated&#13;
above, particularly by developing an even more compelling SRF that exploits our comparative&#13;
advantage to address the most compelling global agricultural and related challenges of our time,&#13;
and to leverage expanded research and development partnerships, including with the CGIAR. To do&#13;
so the Centers perceive the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       a. Revision of the Consortium Constitution to reflect the centers as an integral part of the&#13;
          CGIAR Consortium; and development of operational modalities that create congruence&#13;
          and closer proximity among the various system entities. The modalities to this are not yet&#13;
          fully explored, but options suggested by various Centers include integration of the FC and&#13;
          CB and the FC and CO; full representation of Centers on the CB as opposed to observer&#13;
          status should entertained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   47&#13;
&amp;#12;       b. Integrate the functions of CB and FC and the FC and CO to avoid duplication and&#13;
          confusion and to ensure clear accountability and inclusiveness. The integration should&#13;
          include Center representation in addition to that of donors, NARS, etc. The integrated&#13;
          entity(s) should support resource mobilization at much increased levels and consistent&#13;
          with the level of effort that is required for the CGIAR to make the global difference that is&#13;
          required. In the absence of this integration, systematic performance reviews should not&#13;
          only focus on the CRPs and Centers but on all system entities, including the CO and FO&#13;
          and the FC and CB.&#13;
&#13;
       c. Greater awareness and recognition by all actors that the reform is not about CRP versus&#13;
          Centers but rather the complementarity of the two. CRPs capitalize on the scientific&#13;
          expertise, infrastructure and global modalities of the Centers. We contend that the&#13;
          debate about CRPs versus Centers is injurious to the mission of the CGIAR.&#13;
&#13;
       d. Create modalities for the Centers to assert global scientific leadership to address the SRF&#13;
          through development and execution of a compelling portfolio of CRPs and related&#13;
          activities, with enough room for risk taking and high-end scientific discoveries.&#13;
&#13;
       e. Revise modalities for executing the CRPs that facilitate greater efficiencies and&#13;
          effectiveness with lower transactions costs.&#13;
&#13;
       f.   Enable the balancing of the short and long-term research for development portfolio and&#13;
            up and down stream engagement, based on the comparative advantage of the CGIAR&#13;
            and subsidiary principles that define the requisite partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
       g. Ensure long-term multiyear commitment of funding to the system, both to the Centers&#13;
          and the CRPs. This is consistent with RBM, which assumes that methodology is designed&#13;
          to achieve short, medium and long-term objectives. We would like to emphasize the fact&#13;
          that Centers have funding requirements to cover very critical business needs, including&#13;
          capital development, and requirements for equipment and infrastructure. Centers also&#13;
          feel the pressing need for adequate financial reserves to cover uncertainty and risk,&#13;
          including security risks that attend many of the locations in which Centers are located or&#13;
          CRPs are implemented.&#13;

&amp;#12;Appendix 3.    CGIAR Consortium Submission to the MTR Panel (August 28, 2014)&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The Consortium submitted a briefing note to the MTR Panel at its meeting in January. The&#13;
Consortium Board Chair, Board members, CEO and a number of Consortium staff members have&#13;
subsequently also engaged in conversations with the Panel Chair, some of its members and&#13;
particularly the Member-Secretary â&#128;&#147; most recently around the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s meeting in London in July.&#13;
Now that the Panel has shared its draft initial conclusions, and the 15 Centers have shared their&#13;
views, the Consortium would like to submit this additional note for the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s consideration.&#13;
&#13;
What has worked well and not so well?&#13;
The Consortium agrees with the Panel that the challenge of food security and nutrition, exacerbated&#13;
by climate change, requires a rapid scale-up of carefully targeted agricultural research that can be&#13;
effectively translated into development â&#128;&#147; and that the reform has placed the CGIAR well to lead and&#13;
coordinate scaled-up efforts, but not alone. The Consortium agrees with the Centers that the CRPs&#13;
have been a very positive achievement that have led to much improved collaboration among the&#13;
centers, stronger partnerships, and consolidated work in transversal and essential areas of work&#13;
such as climate change and nutrition. While many of the CRPs were initially still collections of legacy&#13;
activities, ongoing change within the CRPs is resulting in much improved coherence within the CRPs,&#13;
improved collaboration among them, improved theories of change and impact pathways at program&#13;
level, and a much improved sense of the intermediate development outcomes the CGIAR can deliver.&#13;
&#13;
The Consortium agrees with the Centers that the first SRF was successful to help focus the 15&#13;
centers on a more compelling shared agenda â&#128;&#147; even though it also agrees with funders that a more&#13;
quantitative results framework and targets that enable priority setting, resource allocation and&#13;
results based management were lacking and are needed. The Consortium is confident that the&#13;
ongoing work to produce a new SRF, with strong engagement of the investors as well as the centers&#13;
and a consultation of partners and stakeholders, will indeed position the CGIAR well for the next&#13;
round of investments.&#13;
While there are strong partners that share responsibility for some CRPs, the Consortium agrees with&#13;
the Panel that stronger partnerships with the private sector present opportunities for the CGIAR that&#13;
are still largely untapped (with some very positive exceptions). Partnership with national research&#13;
and development organizations could be improved as well.&#13;
&#13;
The increased funding for the CGIAR is clearly a key achievement, due in part to the increased&#13;
priority among investors for food security, but also because the reform positioned the CGIAR well.&#13;
Further growth in funding, required if research is to be scaled up rapidly, will not be easy in the&#13;
current climate and will require a strong and concerted resource mobilization effort from all&#13;
stakeholders, centers, the Consortium and the Fund. The Consortium agrees with the Centers that&#13;
the current combined and complementary funding model (the Windows 1, 2 and 3) is basically&#13;
sound and that combined W1-2 funding should indeed grow to a higher percentage of the total. The&#13;
Consortium has supported a target of 50-60% W1-2 funding and notes that the Centers also support&#13;
a proportion of W1-2 growing to over 60%. The Consortium believes that a new, revitalized SRF and a&#13;
new round of strong, coherent CRP investments that jointly form a high-performing, value-for-money&#13;
portfolio are critical to the further growth of the W1-2 share of CGIAR funding.&#13;
&#13;
The Consortium notes, and shares, the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s concern that the CRP portfolio will need to meet two&#13;
â&#128;&#147; potentially competing â&#128;&#147; challenges, that is: (1) there will need to be sufficient investment in&#13;
upstream, transformative, discovery type research; while on the other hand (2) ensuring that there is&#13;
sufficient investment into integrated delivery of innovations proven to work, at a scale of millions of&#13;
farmers and consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    49&#13;
&amp;#12;Governance&#13;
The Consortium noted in its January briefing note to the MTR Panel that governance and&#13;
management of the CRPs was a key concern for the Consortium. In our opinion the IEA External&#13;
Review of CRP Governance and Management has provided an excellent analysis of the issues and a&#13;
helpful set of recommendations to address them. We are pleased that the Centers and the&#13;
Consortium agreed on a management response to the IEA review that has provided a solid basis for&#13;
adjusting the governance and management of the CRPs; it will provide greater authority for CRP&#13;
directors to manage for results; a stronger position of partners in the steering committees; and&#13;
reduce transaction costs by reducing the number of governance and management committees.&#13;
&#13;
With respect to the system-level governance structure the Consortium agrees with the Panel that the&#13;
reform has led to ambiguities between and among the CB/CO, FC/FO and Centers. The Consortium&#13;
believes that to some considerable extent the resulting conflicts and tensions are a normal â&#128;&#147;even&#13;
unavoidable â&#128;&#147; consequence of a major reorganization of a 40-year old system. Resistance to change&#13;
is part of every major change process. The CGIAR could certainly have done better in managing the&#13;
change process in a more structured manner, and can still learn from this experience going forward.&#13;
The Consortium also agrees that the design of the reform placed the Consortium in a difficult and&#13;
ambiguous position. It has, on the one hand, clear programmatic oversight over the CRPs as a whole&#13;
and fiduciary responsibility for W1-2 funds. It has to approve the CRP proposals of the centers, to&#13;
monitor CRP performance, and allocate funding to the CRPs within the CRP contracts approved by&#13;
the investors. The primary accountability of the Consortium for the CRPs is to the Fund Council, not&#13;
to the Centers. That establishes the â&#128;&#156;regulatorâ&#128;&#157; role, which the Consortium has been given in the&#13;
CGIAR reform, for good reasons, and that the Centers do not always appreciate. On the other hand&#13;
the Consortium also has a role supporting and facilitating Centersâ&#128;&#153; collective actions, the&#13;
development of joint policies and guidelines, and the implementation of some crosscutting actions,&#13;
for which the Consortium accountability is wholly, or at least partly, to its members, the CGIAR&#13;
Centers. This dual role, both as regulator and as facilitator, is indeed causing ambiguities â&#128;&#147; and&#13;
leads to levels of tension, and lack of trust that is unproductive and should be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
The MTR Panel has indicated it supports a single Board, in place of the current dual structure with a&#13;
Fund Council and Consortium Board, and the Centers have indicated their support for such a&#13;
solution in their submission to the panel as well. The Consortium is definitely interested to explore&#13;
how the Fund Council and Consortium could work together more productively, but is concerned that&#13;
the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s recommendation would have huge transaction costs. It has taken considerable time and&#13;
effort to establish the Consortium as an international organization and a do-over at this stage could&#13;
derail the critical business of putting in place a strong SRF and second phase of the CRP portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
One question the Consortium has for the Panel is how it proposes to resolve the inherent conflict of&#13;
interest of the members of the proposed single board. The idea that donors will share decision&#13;
making on the CGIAR funding to CRPS with the Centers (recipients of those funds), industry (which&#13;
may or not contribute funding), NARS (that would be partners contributing in kind in most cases),&#13;
and scientists (which do not fund anything) is not realistic. The practical challenges associated with&#13;
such a single board should receive more attention. Maybe, in the longer term one can develop a&#13;
single Board, but then the decision making on funding would likely shift to a finance committee with&#13;
donor members of one form or another.&#13;
The current design, where the Consortium does not implement research, and has an armâ&#128;&#153;s length&#13;
relationship with the Centers, allows the Consortium Board to take decisions regarding the CRP&#13;
portfolio and individual CRPs without a conflict of interest. This degree of independence of the&#13;
Consortium from the Centers is a key feature of the new CGIAR â&#128;&#147; built into its design deliberately -&#13;
that is causing the dissatisfaction noted by the Centersâ&#128;&#153; Directors General in their submission to the&#13;
MTR Panel. It also enables the Consortium to be impartial and have its allegiance first and foremost&#13;
to the SRF.&#13;
&#13;
50&#13;
&amp;#12;The Consortium represents the interests of the CGIAR system as a whole and has its primary&#13;
allegiance to the implementation of the SRF and the health and performance of the entire CRP&#13;
portfolio; not the interests of individual centers or CRPs. This is a critical difference in the way the&#13;
Consortium addresses its work and determines its positions. The Centers will need to clarify what&#13;
they really mean when they ask for a change in the Constitution to become part of the Consortium.&#13;
While the Centers clearly already are a component of the Consortium â&#128;&#147; as was stated in the updated&#13;
legal opinion* â&#128;&#147; the fact that they cannot currently dictate what decisions they would like the&#13;
Consortium Board to take is indeed a critical feature of the current design and should not change&#13;
without endangering the impartial role of the Consortium in the new CGIAR. It is clear that this is a&#13;
significant difference with many other membership-type organizations where the members do indeed&#13;
determine the positions.&#13;
&#13;
Functioning of the Consortium&#13;
While the Consortium is ready to engage in discussions that may lead to a reform of the system-wide&#13;
governance structure over time, it also believes there are some issues in the current structure that&#13;
should be resolved at short notice. These emerged in 2013 out of discussions between the FC and&#13;
CB and were addressed in part in the PwC review of CGIAR governance, specifically:&#13;
   ï&#130;· The FC decision in April 2013 that the Consortium can only be funded through W1 of the&#13;
        Fund, and that its budget is capped, are in direct contradiction to the Joint Agreement and&#13;
        Constitution of the Consortium. The FC is not a board for the Consortium, and it does not&#13;
        consider the funding requirements required to fulfill the Consortium mission. The Consortium&#13;
        accepts that the FC is not obliged to make available more than the subsidy it is willing to&#13;
        allocate the Consortium, but then the Consortium Board should be free â&#128;&#147; indeed has the&#13;
        fiduciary responsibility - to raise the resources it deems necessary fulfill the Consortiumâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        mission to the best of its abilities.&#13;
   ï&#130;· The Consortium Office is an entity of the Consortium, reporting to the Consortium Board (not&#13;
        a system entity reporting to the FC). It is the Consortium, not the Consortium Office, which is&#13;
        accountable to the Fund Council and reports to the Fund Council.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities for collective action and for increased efficiency and effectiveness&#13;
The Consortium agrees with the Centers that another of the things that have worked well in the&#13;
reform is the prospect of more collective action. The Consortium believes there are opportunities to&#13;
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the system, and reduce its transaction costs, if the&#13;
system is able to think like a Billion $ organization (while maintaining the advantages of a&#13;
decentralized networked â&#128;&#156;consortiumâ&#128;&#157;, not a single centralized organization). It has indeed taken&#13;
quite a long time for 9 Centers and the Consortium to implement a single ERP, the Once Corporate&#13;
System (OCS), and there are clearly lessons to be learned on how this could have been done more&#13;
effectively. The Consortium agrees, though, with the two reviews of CGIAR governance carried out in&#13;
2013 that a shared ERP such as OCS is a key enabler of more collective action, as well as a&#13;
requirement for better and faster CRP management â&#128;&#147; and reporting and information across centers.&#13;
The Consortium and a group of center corporate service directors are developing a business plan for&#13;
increased collective action along at least three main axes, i.e. shared systems and services, shared&#13;
country offices, and shared management of security risks and stronger communities of practice. We&#13;
note the Centers commit to do more in this area in the future in their submission to the MTR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
*The version of the note â&#128;&#156;What is the CGIAR Consortiumâ&#128;&#157; appended to the Centersâ&#128;&#153; submission to the MTR&#13;
Panel was an old version, revised after consultation with the centers and re-issued in June. It recognizes the&#13;
Centers as one of the three components of the Consortium, members of, but separate from, the Consortium.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             51&#13;
&amp;#12;In addition, the Consortium believes that continued action (as already taken by some Centers) to&#13;
reduce the very large number of small grants in the system would reduce transaction costs&#13;
significantly, and make the overall portfolio more strategic. This was a key objective of the reform,&#13;
that is, reducing the over 3,500 bilateral grants on Center books pre-reform, to a small portfolio of&#13;
large coherent programs. While it is recognized that some small grants may well have a strategic&#13;
nature, generally speaking, a small number of larger bilateral grants (e.g., reducing the number to&#13;
500 larger bilateral grants, plus some small grants, from over 2,000), complementing a system of&#13;
CRPs with a solid share (50-60%) of pooled W1-2 funding and single reporting was a core idea&#13;
behind the reform that still has to be fully realized.&#13;
&#13;
Jointly, the opportunity for large-scale efficiencies in the system from increased collective action,&#13;
shared country offices and a reduced number of small grants has the potential to increase&#13;
efficiencies and reduce transaction costs very significantly more than reducing the number of board&#13;
members, merging centers or reducing center overheads would. Realizing this potential will require&#13;
investments first, however.&#13;
&#13;
The way forward&#13;
The Consortium agrees with the Centers that there are many things that have gone well in the reform&#13;
and that this is a time to capitalize on the investments made in the reform over the last five years,&#13;
particularly by developing a strong, compelling SRF and implementing an excellent process for the&#13;
CRP 2nd Call that delivers a compelling investment portfolio, enables much improved joint resource&#13;
mobilization and has clear development outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
The Consortium also agrees that it is wise to develop operational modalities that create congruence&#13;
and closer proximity among the various system entities. While this may over time lead to a single&#13;
Board, the Consortium Board is not, at this time, convinced that a system with a single large Board&#13;
would be practical or solve the issues the system currently experiences. Any new system of&#13;
governance should help decrease the ambiguities and simplify the overall system, but would have to&#13;
maintain a separation of tasks and responsibilities that maintains investor confidence that funds are&#13;
managed without conflicts of interest. In general, the Consortium would like to see the MTR&#13;
recommendations further developed, to help our ongoing work in the context of current realities. The&#13;
Consortium would appreciate orientation on how to adjust current work, with more guidance on what&#13;
ought to be done how, when and by whom.&#13;
&#13;
In the shorter term, the Consortium Board thinks that a number of actions could be taken as follows:&#13;
     1. Confirm, resource and ensure a firm focus on the core business of the CGIAR through&#13;
        development and approval of a new SRF and commissioning of a new portfolio of CRPs by&#13;
        December 31, 2016.&#13;
     2. Change the funding model of the Consortium to a levy (fixed % of CSP for a number of years)&#13;
        set by the FC on the proposal of the Consortium Board, as a contribution to its operating&#13;
        costs â&#128;&#147; with full responsibility of the Consortium Board for revenue and expenditure to meet&#13;
        its mission, as well as accountability for spending this levy to the FC.&#13;
     3. FC support in 2015 for the development of a business case to scale up collective action and&#13;
        shared services across the CGIAR system, in order to achieve large scale efficiencies across&#13;
        the system, through a W1 allocation of about $1 million to the Consortium.&#13;
     4. Ensure longer-term multi-year stable financing for CRPs through innovative financing that,&#13;
        among others, helps to turn multi-year commitments from CGIAR investors into upfront cash&#13;
        and could enable the CGIAR system to access soft loans (e.g. for scaling out or delivery).&#13;
     5. Develop and implement a CGIAR-wide strategy to engage and partner more effectively with&#13;
        the private sector to scale up and out strategic public-private partnerships with key seed&#13;
&#13;
52&#13;
&amp;#12;   companies, food companies, and large retailers, as well as the small to medium enterprises&#13;
   such as Asian and African seed companies over the next 3-5 years.&#13;
6. Intensify the partnership with key NARES in medium income countries (including but not&#13;
   limited to EMBRAPA, CAAS and ICAR) to take advantage of their sizeable national&#13;
   investments in agricultural research that have the potential to be leveraged to a much&#13;
   greater extent internationally.&#13;
7. Support a crosscutting program (or platform) for investments in gene banks (e.g. cryo-&#13;
   preservation), common tools, such as related to bio-informatics and â&#128;&#156;big dataâ&#128;&#157;, high thru-put&#13;
   phenotyping sites and state of the art infrastructure, managed on a system-wide basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              53&#13;
&amp;#12;Appendix 4.      Summary of Responses to Panel TOR Questions&#13;
Research&#13;
ï&#130;· Does the research commissioning process and incentives comply with best practices globally?&#13;
&#13;
We are not aware of â&#128;&#156;best practices.â&#128;&#157; There are a number of different guidelines used by research&#13;
organizations. CGIAR appears to be using guidance developed in 2007, criteria which are consistent&#13;
with the guidelines used by others. Based on a review of the first round of CRPs, it appears that the&#13;
current process leads to reasonably well-defined research priorities at the CRP level. Selection&#13;
criteria are appropriate. The pre-proposal and proposal quality is highly variable, and the ISPC has&#13;
done a good job in reviewing the proposals. However, that does not necessarily impact decision-&#13;
making by the Fund Council. There is no performance index which makes clear deliverables and&#13;
accountabilities, and the reporting is highly variable.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    What should CGIAR be doing to improve the way research is managed and integrated across its&#13;
     Centers?&#13;
&#13;
The lack of a suitable SRF makes it difficult to define program boundaries, potential synergies, and&#13;
the need for cross-cutting support and research linkages. Without a suitable results framework it is&#13;
not clear how the Consortium Board can manage the system towards greater coherence, efficiency&#13;
and effectiveness. Currently the responsibility for linking activities to pathways is pushed down to the&#13;
CRP level. It appears that there should be opportunities to build on clusters of expertise in Centers to&#13;
facilitate synergy and collective impact. For example, would it be sensible for breeders or those&#13;
working on big data across all of the Centers to engage more frequently and deeply to share lessons&#13;
and knowledge? If yes, then a structural arrangement would be required to facilitate this.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Is CGIAR effectively building diversity, including gender, into its research programs?&#13;
&#13;
There have been a number of reviews of this issue (e.g., ISPC in 2011, SPIA in 2011, and&#13;
Consortium reports in 2012 and 2014, including a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy). There is greater&#13;
inclusion of gender issues in CRPs. Recognition of gender as a cross-cutting issue in the new SRF&#13;
should further strengthen this. However, the data show a lack of gender balance across the CGIAR.&#13;
The issue is certainly being given the attention it is due at the strategic level. The question that&#13;
remains is the extent to which action and progress will be monitored and acted upon.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Does CGIAR have the appropriate balance of research for development, and a focus on delivery&#13;
     for end-users?&#13;
&#13;
The focus on delivery through the CRPs has reportedly improved in several of the CRP extension&#13;
proposals. The next round of CRP proposals needs to clarify how the proposals will serve end-usersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
needs and the impact pathways necessary to deliver results. Finding the right balance is a matter of&#13;
understanding the research required to enable the impact.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    How can CGIAR better deliver its research to the field and what model(s) should it employ to do&#13;
     so?&#13;
&#13;
The 2014 Dalberg report provides a number of recommendations regarding â&#128;&#156;delivery.â&#128;&#157; The Panel&#13;
recognizes that there have been mixed views on the accuracy of this report and is not in a position to&#13;
judge one way or the other. The Panel considers that the important question which should be&#13;
addressed in each CRP, after impact pathways are well understood, is the extent to which delivery is&#13;
embedded in a CRP, as opposed to simply providing mechanisms to facilitate delivery by another&#13;
entity. This does not mean that CGIAR is the delivery agent, but that a roadmap is designed at the&#13;
&#13;
54&#13;
&amp;#12;outset, and redesigned as necessary, to ensure that the research is readily translated into action at a&#13;
scale required to achieve the desired impact.&#13;
&#13;
Partners&#13;
ï&#130;· Does CGIAR engage with the appropriate partners to deliver high-quality research and impact?&#13;
&#13;
A major benefit of the reform and the resulting CGIAR Research Programs is increased collaboration&#13;
among Centers and with other partners. The Elsevier studies, the IEAâ&#128;&#153;s review of CRPs, and other&#13;
evaluations confirm this progress. Some Centers have substantial partnerships with the private&#13;
sector (in both developed and developing countries). Stakeholder surveys by GlobeScan and by some&#13;
Panel members show mixed views on accessibility to partner with Centers. The question that should&#13;
be asked is whether current partnerships adequately tap key players to scale-up and accelerate&#13;
research and roll-out appropriately targeted and budgeted research to address 2030 issues. There is&#13;
clearly room to grow in this area.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   What CGIAR incentives weaken or strengthen partnerships?&#13;
&#13;
It was reported, but not verified by the Panel, that almost all W1/W2 funding goes to Centers, not to&#13;
external CRP partners. If this is the case, then some potential partners may be reluctant to join a&#13;
CRP. There is also the issue of high transaction costs, as reported by the Centers and CRP directors.&#13;
But overall, it appears the incentives far outweigh the disincentives (which should nonetheless be&#13;
addressed). The main incentive is the opportunity to join a CRP or other research programs&#13;
undertaken by Centers. As evidenced by progress-to-date, the CGIAR Centers have the capacity to&#13;
scale-up partnerships where and when it makes sense.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   How can CGIAR enhance its accessibility to and collaboration with partners?&#13;
&#13;
Guidance for partnering should be established and monitored across the CGIAR. The use of&#13;
GlobeScan-type surveys should be continued to solicit feedback from existing and potential partners.&#13;
A special effort should be undertaken to reach out to the international food and beverage industry,&#13;
and similar industries, to engage in a dialogue on collaborative partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   How can CGIAR best engage with national agricultural research systems?&#13;
&#13;
Several of the respondents to the GlobeScan survey (including the responses to the Panel)&#13;
expressed the need for CGIAR to more effectively work with and build the capacity of the NARs.&#13;
Others expressed that this is not the role of CGIAR; it should focus on producing international public&#13;
goods. In discussions with Center and CRP staff, the general view, supported by the Panel, was that&#13;
CGIAR should work with and build the capacity of the NARs as and when needed to successfully carry&#13;
out the work of the CRPs and to set the stage for delivery of research results to achieve impact on&#13;
the ground. The Panel considers that a concerted effort by bilateral and multilateral development&#13;
agencies is required to elevate the recognition by recipient country governments of the need to&#13;
invest in building strong NARs. The Panel also considers that aid programs should support capacity&#13;
development by establishing strong linkages to CGIAR and other international research programs.&#13;
&#13;
Funding&#13;
ï&#130;· Is the structure of CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s entire funding system appropriate for the purpose, or does it create&#13;
   perverse incentives for free-riding or other sub-optimal practices?&#13;
&#13;
Overall investment in CGIAR has doubled in five years to $1 billion in 2013, with $342 million in&#13;
Windows 1 and 2; $140 million in Window 3; and $524 million in other bilateral contributions and&#13;
Center earnings. Window 3 and other bilateral funding, which represents about 65% of total CGIAR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     55&#13;
&amp;#12;funding, comes from approximately 3,000 grants that are restricted and often support very small&#13;
projects. The expected shift of funding to Windows 1 and 2 has not met expectations. Some reviews&#13;
have suggested that the focus should be on making W1/2 attractive and not worrying about W3. A&#13;
review of the last two Fund Council meetings shows no discussion on innovative financing. A major&#13;
concern of many Centers is that current funding does not cover core costs, such as Center&#13;
infrastructure needs.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     What are the implications of misalignment among all funding sources (i.e., contributions to the&#13;
      Fund and other support to CGIAR) for the governance and management of the system?&#13;
&#13;
At the present time, following a period of rapid growth in funding, the misalignment does not seem to&#13;
have had an adverse impact. The flexibility shown up to now in allowing Window 3 contributions to be&#13;
assigned to CRPs has probably been a factor in funding growth, but at the same time has&#13;
contributed to the misalignment.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     Is the concept of fully pooled funding a realizable goal, or will Window 3 and bilateral funding&#13;
      increasingly dominate?&#13;
&#13;
It does not appear to be a realizable goal.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     What mechanisms can enhance donor participation in pooled funding?&#13;
&#13;
Efforts should be made to strengthen donorsâ&#128;&#153; confidence that W1/W2 contributions will achieve&#13;
greater value for money.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     Does CGIAR have a clear understanding of the total funding needed to meet its goals?&#13;
&#13;
No, it is unlikely that anyone does. The report of the Commission on the Economy and the Climate&#13;
(2014) recommends that funding for agricultural research be doubled by 2030.&#13;
&#13;
Structure and governance&#13;
ï&#130;· Has the separation between funders and researchers led to a more efficient and effective&#13;
    CGIAR?&#13;
No.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     Are the roles of the various CGIAR entities (e.g., the Fund Council, IEA, ISPC, and the Consortium)&#13;
      distinct, clear, and well aligned to ensure accountability?&#13;
No.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     Are the current governance arrangements consistent with best practices?&#13;
&#13;
We are reluctant to assess best practices. The current arrangements are inconsistent with the&#13;
governance structures adopted by most international partnership organizations over the last several&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     Have the reforms increased overall costs and, if so, is that increase justified by better, more&#13;
      relevant research resulting in greater impact?&#13;
ï&#130;·&#13;
The actual increase in costs is unclear, and the impact of such investments on the outcome of&#13;
research is even less clear.&#13;

&amp;#12;Appendix 5.      Governance Structure: Review of Global Partnerships&#13;
&#13;
In considering possible means of addressing CGIAR governance ambiguities, the MTR Panel&#13;
considered responses by other organizations and funds that have faced similar challenges. It is&#13;
worth noting that CGIAR was one of the first global partnerships designed to take collective action to&#13;
help developing countries reduce poverty and grow their economies. Since CGIAR was established&#13;
more than 40 years ago, many multi-stakeholder partnerships and multi-donor funds have emerged&#13;
to address challenges and issues, such as climate finance, vaccinations, major infectious diseases,&#13;
and education. Bezanson and Isenman (2012)27 attribute the growth in targeted, multi-partner funds&#13;
to (i) recognition of the size and complexity of challenges for which single actors are not adequately&#13;
equipped, (ii) the decline in confidence of existing aid structures and business models, (iii) the rapid&#13;
spread of new technologies, (iv) successful advocacy of NGOs, and (v) their political appeal in donor&#13;
countries. Many of the newer partnerships have been instrumental in developing and testing a new&#13;
kind of governance that is based on the concept of stakeholder constituencies as opposed to&#13;
shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
For the purpose of MTR Panel deliberations, the governance structures of several partnership&#13;
organizations were reviewed. The results are summarized in the table below. All of the partnership&#13;
organizations or funds reviewed are governed by single boards that have varying structures, but all&#13;
include both donors and recipients. Several boards include stakeholders other than donors and&#13;
recipients as active members or observers. Some of these stakeholders also have active voting&#13;
rights. In contrast, the current CGIAR governance structure is rather unique in its two-pillared&#13;
structure, comprised of the Fund Council and Consortium Board, each supported by an&#13;
administrative office.28&#13;
&#13;
The PwC report on CGIAR governance suggested that CGIAR should consider a single board. The&#13;
report suggested that a â&#128;&#156;leaner governance structureâ&#128;&#157; could (i) reduce duplication, (ii) achieve greater&#13;
efficiency, and (iii) improve accountability. The PwC report also noted that â&#128;&#156;other organizations with&#13;
prior dual structures have often opted for a single board, which comprises representatives of key&#13;
stakeholders and partners balanced with independent individuals who are appointed on the basis of&#13;
their skills and networks. A single secretariat with a strong CEO oversees program and performance&#13;
management, providing internal and external visibility for the organization, while innovative and&#13;
effective partnerships are seen as key ingredients for success.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
In discussing the challenges of governance for organizations and partnerships, Bezanson and&#13;
Isenman note that there is no agreed definition of â&#128;&#156;goodâ&#128;&#157; governance. However, they do outline&#13;
the main (generic) strategic and fiduciary responsibilities for governing boards.29 These include&#13;
the following.&#13;
&#13;
Structure and Composition: Ensuring that Board size is conducive to efficient and effective&#13;
decision-making and that its membership reflects the mix of skills, abilities, experiences and&#13;
competencies required to meet the needs of the organization.&#13;
&#13;
Strategy and Plan: Ensuring that the organization has a clear direction, knows where it is trying&#13;
to go, has set reasonable goals, objectives and targets and has aligned these to the&#13;
&#13;
27 K.A. Bezanson and P. Isenman. â&#128;&#156;Governance of New Global Partnerships: Challenges, Weakness, and&#13;
Lessons.â&#128;&#157; Center for Global Development Policy Paper 014. 2012.&#13;
28 The fact that the Center partners have their own Boards adds to the complexity, but is not considered by the&#13;
&#13;
Panel to be unique. Most major partnerships comprising legal entities have a similar situation in that each&#13;
partner is directly governed by a Board or similar entity accountable for that entityâ&#128;&#153;s strategic and fiduciary&#13;
performance.&#13;

&amp;#12;appropriate means for their attainment, including the required human and financial resources&#13;
and the internal incentive system.&#13;
&#13;
Roles and Responsibilities: Ensuring that the principal roles and responsibilities of directors are&#13;
stipulated and communicated, including the effective delegation of authorities and clear&#13;
differentiation of the respective roles of management and board members.&#13;
&#13;
Performance Oversight and Assessment: Ensuring that the organization has in place information&#13;
systems that track performance against established objectives and that timely reviews are&#13;
conducted and adjustments/adaptations made as required.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Oversight and Management: Ensuring that the organization is well managed&#13;
financially, that its accounting systems are designed and applied with professionalism and that&#13;
there is independent audit and certification of accounts.&#13;
&#13;
Risks and Opportunities Oversight: Ensuring that corporate and other risk assessments are&#13;
regularly conducted and that risks are monitored and opportunities for risk mitigation are&#13;
pursued.&#13;
&#13;
Communications: Ensuring that the organization and its management have in place the means&#13;
to communicate effectively the organizationâ&#128;&#153;s key messages and that this is applied with&#13;
consistency.&#13;
&#13;
Succession Planning: Ensuring that there are succession plans for board membership and for&#13;
the Chief Executive.&#13;
&#13;
Legal and Ethical Conduct: Ensuring that there are written conflict of interest and code of ethics&#13;
policies and codified governance guidelines for boards and their committees.&#13;
&#13;
Even though it has existed for many more years than most similar partnerships, CGIAR can learn&#13;
from the governance lessons of some of the newer partnerships. For example, the governance&#13;
experience of the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), initially established in 2002 as the&#13;
Fast Track Initiative (FTI), is worth reviewing. The FTI governance went through a series of&#13;
reforms made necessary because the partnership was launched before its structures, functions,&#13;
lines of accountability, and basic objectives had been fully worked out. Following reviews in&#13;
2005 and 2008, the FTI consolidated its various governing committees into a Board of&#13;
Directors. The constituency-based Board currently has 19 members, senior-level&#13;
representatives of various constituencies, and a full-time independent chair. Initially, the&#13;
chairing arrangement was for Board members to select two co-chairs on a rotating basis. A&#13;
comprehensive review in 2010 noted considerable improvements in the GPE governance&#13;
following the reforms, but found the co-chairing arrangements to be sub-optimal. The GPE has&#13;
since replaced the rotating co-chair arrangement with a full-time, independent and non-voting&#13;
chair.30&#13;

&amp;#12;Appendix 6: Outline of Possible Transitional Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
A number of comments received prior to the Consultation Draft and subsequent to it have raised&#13;
concerns about the change process in transitioning from a two-pillar to a single board governance&#13;
structure. There is concern about potential disruptions to ongoing work and the time it might take to&#13;
make the transition and the risk that the next round of CRPs might be delayed. It is the view of the&#13;
Panel that the finalization of the SRF, the initial guidelines and the call for proposals for the next&#13;
round of CRPs, and planning required to strengthen ISPC can all be achieved in parallel with the&#13;
transition planning process, and that the new Board should be able to be in place in time for the CRP&#13;
approval process. In order to demonstrate how this might be achieved, we have outlined below&#13;
possible transitional arrangements, not as a definitive piece, but simply to illustrate the sort of&#13;
timetable that could be adopted.&#13;
&#13;
November 2014 â&#128;&#147; December 2015 â&#128;&#147; Action Plan Implementation&#13;
By the end of November, the FC Chair appoints a Transition Team Leader (TTL), who would manage a&#13;
transition team and be the focal point for engagement with stakeholders for consultation on the&#13;
various elements of the shift from the two-pillar to a single board governance structure.&#13;
&#13;
By the end of December, (i) the TTL with support from the Fund Office (FO), identifies expertise&#13;
requirements for TT, detailed TOR for each, and candidates to be recruited, and (ii) the Fund Council,&#13;
Consortium Board, and Centers designate a cross-CGIAR advisory team, with four members from&#13;
each of the three.&#13;
&#13;
January 2015 â&#128;&#147; April 2015&#13;
By January 15, 2015, the TT is in place, with an office at the FO. This is likely to be two senior&#13;
experts, in addition to the TTL, all capable of interacting one-on-one with stakeholders and&#13;
representatives of â&#128;&#156;peer agencies,â&#128;&#157; such as GAVI, GPE, etc., plus three more junior professionals to&#13;
assist in research and drafting. In addition, the World Bank would be requested to second an&#13;
individual from the Trusteeâ&#128;&#153;s Office and another from the Legal department on a part-time basis to&#13;
support the work of the Transition Team.&#13;
&#13;
By mid-February 2015, circulate a detailed TOR for Board Chair and process for his/her recruitment,&#13;
for eventual approval by the Fund Council on a no-objections basis by the end of February.&#13;
&#13;
By mid-March 2015, the consultation draft options paper on Board size, membership, constituency&#13;
breakdown, and self-selection process discussed at a workshop with the cross-CGIAR advisory team.&#13;
Other interested parties and potential key stakeholder group representatives could also be invited).&#13;
&#13;
By mid-April 2015, professional head hunters establish a short-list of candidates for the Board Chair.&#13;
&#13;
Late April 2015 â&#128;&#147; Fund Council Meeting&#13;
TT proposes for approval (i) a short-list of candidates for the Board Chair, along with proposed&#13;
selection process, (ii) Board structure, constituencies and process for self-selecting representatives&#13;
to the Board, and (iii) the procedure and selection criteria for locating the Administrative Unit.&#13;
&#13;
TT also submits for information progress on the (i) design of the Administrative Unit functions,&#13;
accountabilities and composition, (ii) delineation of joint responsibilities of Centers (i.e., the selected&#13;
functions of the Consortium Office that would transferred to Centers for joint responsibility), and (iii)&#13;
a detailed work plan up to the November FC meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                        63&#13;
&amp;#12;May - September 2015&#13;
By the end of May 2015, TT recommendations revised in accordance with guidance from FC.&#13;
Detailed options on Board roles and responsibilities and accountabilities, as well as the&#13;
Administrative Unitâ&#128;&#153;s design, functions, and responsibilities, prepared and discussed in a second&#13;
workshop with the cross-CGIAR advisory team.&#13;
&#13;
TT assists/facilitates constituencies as required to agree on initial Board membership.&#13;
&#13;
By mid- September 2015, circulate for virtual discussion, the change management plan; initial&#13;
policies and procedures necessary to hold the first Board meeting; assessment of proposals for&#13;
location of the Administrative Unit; and proposed compensation, rights, and privileges, etc. for Board&#13;
members and Administrative Unit staff.&#13;
&#13;
By the end of September, the change management plan etc. (see above) discussed at third cross-&#13;
CGIAR Advisory Team workshop. External stakeholders likely to be on Board would be invited.&#13;
&#13;
October 2015&#13;
Circulate for the November Fund Council meeting the (i) selection of Board Chair, (ii) Board&#13;
composition, (iii) first Board meeting agenda, and (iv) draft agreement on the establishment of&#13;
the Administrative Unit.&#13;
&#13;
November 2015 Fund Council Meeting&#13;
The Fund Council would approve the appointment of the Chair, and the establishment of the Board&#13;
and the Administrative Unit, and would dissolve itself.&#13;
&#13;
The new Board Chair would convene the first Board meeting and consider for approval the proposed&#13;
Board responsibilities, rules, and procedures; the Boardâ&#128;&#153;s and Administrative Unitâ&#128;&#153;s workplans and&#13;
budgets; and policies and procedures required to maintain operational momentum on preparation of&#13;
the second round of CRP proposals.&#13;
&#13;
November 2015 â&#128;&#147; December 2016 â&#128;&#147; Initial Board Priorities&#13;
November 2015 and April 2016: First two Board meetings would appoint the Chair; adopt the basic&#13;
policy framework, including changes in ISPC, etc.; agree on Board operating guidelines; establish&#13;
Donor Council; establish priority Board committees, such as an Audit Committee, etc.; approve&#13;
Administrative Unit structure, staffing and initial budget and appoint the head of the Unit; receive&#13;
reviews of current CRPs; and confirm endorsement of the new SRF and new CRP selection criteria.&#13;
&#13;
November 2016: Third Board meeting would, among other business, review and approve the second&#13;
round of CRPs.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Supplementary Appendix:&#13;
Comments from CGIAR Stakeholders on Consultation Draft of the MTR Report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI)&#13;
&#13;
     The Association of Agriculture Research Institutions in the Near East &amp; North Africa&#13;
           (AARINENA) fully endorses the comments below submitted by APAARI&#13;
&#13;
Thank you for the opportunity for APAARI to comment on the Mid Term Review (MTR) panel report.&#13;
We do recognise that this report is the culmination of wide ranging consultation and submissions by&#13;
stakeholders duly considered by the Panel. APAARI members were pleased to have provided earlier&#13;
our input into this process. As such, we are limiting our comments now only to major&#13;
findings/recommendations which possibly could be considered by the Fund Council in Brussels.&#13;
&#13;
APAARI considers that MTR Panel has undertaken a thorough exercise relating to ongoing CGIAR&#13;
reform process. It has addressed well the existing challenges, and has made a number of relevant&#13;
recommendations for required future direction and impetus to reform process. Indeed, it is both&#13;
timely and a useful contribution, although much will now depend on the effective implementation of&#13;
these recommendations subject to their endorsement by Fund Council.&#13;
&#13;
The nine recommendations in the Panel Report (and the associated conclusions) form good overall&#13;
basis for pursuing the reforms and correcting the existing anomalies identified by the stakeholders,&#13;
centres and the donors during the consultation process. APAARI as a regional forum would like to&#13;
offer following suggestions for consideration:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   The need for greater clarity in the CGIAR Vision and Mission is fully supported, but it is not clear&#13;
    as to how a more elaborate mission statement as suggested in the report will link to the new&#13;
    Strategic Results Framework (SRF) to avoid duplication or potential confusion. The SRF and CRPs&#13;
    should be the key vehicles for elaborating and delivering the Vision and Mission statements.&#13;
    Unfortunately, so far there is no clarity on SRF and the process has invariably taken long time.&#13;
    Hence, urgency for putting in place SRF must be highlighted with a defined time frame and the&#13;
    process should be transparent and consultative, involving the developing NARS and all&#13;
    stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    A CGIAR Task Force to identify priorities and least cost options on a systematic basis is useful&#13;
    recognising that the links and timing of such a prioritisation process will likely have a strong&#13;
    bearing on the development of the new SRF and its implementation. This needs further&#13;
    explanation in our view, given that the new SRF is still being developed. The open data facilities&#13;
    are required and such a network will need to be developed in consort with existing regional and&#13;
    global research data networks to be effective and to avoid wasteful duplication.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   We fully agree that the preparation of the SRF must have sufficient stakeholder participation to&#13;
    ensure ownership of the final product. With regards to the NARS and regional forums the two way&#13;
    interaction will need proactive action by all parties. To date many NARS feel somewhat sidelined&#13;
    in the deliberative mechanisms. APAARI and other regional forums can be important focal points&#13;
    for progressing this process further, especially through effective stakeholder involvement. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     65&#13;
&amp;#12;     GCARD Road Map had been an outcome of this process and hence we must take advantage of&#13;
     such initiatives while finalising SRF and needed CRPs&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    The proposed single CGIAR Board to replace the Fund Council and Consortium Board is indeed&#13;
     the most radical proposition, which should be taken up as a priority. In doing so the current&#13;
     ambiguities and confusions for the overlapping roles and responsibilities should be resolved,&#13;
     since the lack of clarity on roles has potential implications for cost and managerial efficiency. A&#13;
     unified and more streamlined governance structure would improve the system's efficiency,&#13;
     coordination and convergence. Further, a suggestion to form a donor council (like the Finance&#13;
     Committee chaired by World Bank in the past) to advise the CGIAR Board is most appropriate. In&#13;
     addition, it is our considered view that there could also be an Independent Advisory Committee&#13;
     (IAC) for the single Board having representation of eminent persons representing different&#13;
     NARS /regional organisations to provide matured advice on national/regional perspectives and&#13;
     developments. The role of regional forums and NARS in greater adoption of research results and&#13;
     their role in capacity building can be substantially enhanced to out scale innovations for greater&#13;
     impact on small holder farmers.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    The CGIAR partnerships will require much more serious efforts in strengthening to avoid slippage&#13;
     and to ensure greater partnerships in future. This is the considered view of regional forums&#13;
     based on feedback of various NARS members and stakeholders. Stronger partnership will help&#13;
     immensely in scaling up research, adoption and improved financing for the future. We also&#13;
     support the important role of both public and private partnerships, as emphasised by the review&#13;
     panel. APAARI stands ready to be an active regional contributor to these endeavours. It has&#13;
     suitable networks involving emerging Asian economies to make a positive contribution in&#13;
     meeting the CGIAR Goal and Mission.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Similarly, APAARI and other regional forums can be active partners with the CGIAR and its&#13;
     constituent centers in research policy advocacy, including political level representations and&#13;
     deliberations, knowledge sharing, capacity building and research partnerships. Suitable&#13;
     mechanisms for making such partnerships feasible in practice require further consideration.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    The proposed extension and elaboration of the ISPC role and leadership in providing guidance,&#13;
     analyses and quality assurance (like the role of TEC in the past) is fully supported. Its role and&#13;
     authority for partnerships requires further clarity and action since in our view this has remained a&#13;
     weak link despite existing reforms.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    An additional comment relates to GCARD. The regional forums consider this an important event&#13;
     to bring all stakeholders on a common platform to deliberate periodically the research&#13;
     outcomes/outputs of CGIAR system, and to provide periodic strategy for their faster adoption&#13;
     through greater involvement of stakeholders. We consider this to be an important requirement&#13;
     for which allocation of resources will be more productive in the long run. Interface among&#13;
     stakeholders at frequent intervals is considered to be a useful investment. No doubt, required&#13;
     reforms for the GCARD process will be put in place alongside the implementation of the MTR&#13;
     Panel Review report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
66&#13;
&amp;#12;Further, while resource mobilisation has been considered in the review findings and&#13;
recommendations, the role of window 3/bilateral funding sources has not been fully addressed.&#13;
Given the ongoing importance of these funding options in the overall financial position of the CGIAR,&#13;
it is considered that member centers of the CGIAR should be able to raise contributions from the&#13;
donors though these channels and other sources in the future without any restriction. Also the&#13;
importance of window 1 and 2 funds and also the importance of autonomy of each of the institutions&#13;
should also be emphasised.&#13;
&#13;
We do hope that above APAARI comments will be helpful and be considered as a constructive&#13;
contribution towards the on-going reform process. APAARI being very supportive of the Panel report,&#13;
looks forward in participating actively towards implementation of its recommendations once&#13;
approved by the Fund Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)&#13;
&#13;
As representatives of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation on the Fund Council, we strongly support&#13;
all nine MTR recommendations and want to publicly acknowledge the tremendous contribution of&#13;
the MTR panel. Recommendations that we want to call out as high priority for the future success of&#13;
the CGIAR reform include: governance (one board), innovative financing, and taking time to develop&#13;
a strong SRF to frame the next round of CRPs. All three of these issues are interrelated.&#13;
&#13;
We are quite aware that implementation of these recommendations will require grappling with as-yet&#13;
unanswered questions, especially the governance structure and the wording of new governance&#13;
documents. Outcomes of the proposed changes should include:&#13;
   ï&#130;· simplified governance structure, including advisory bodies&#13;
   ï&#130;· appropriate allocation of responsibility and risk among a unified board and the Center&#13;
       Boards&#13;
   ï&#130;· clearly defined roles and responsibilities of all parties of the CGIAR (CGIAR Board, CGIAR&#13;
       Board Chair, advisory bodies, Center Board Chairs, Center DGs, CRP Directors, etc.) â&#128;&#147; this is&#13;
       one of the key issues that has adversely impacted the CGIAR reform implementation during&#13;
       the past four years and the recommended changes create an opportunity to institute clear&#13;
       responsibility and accountability for all parties of the CGIAR.&#13;
&#13;
A few additional comments that may help shape the conversation at FC12 include:&#13;
&#13;
(1) Transition â&#128;&#147; the CGIAR is at a fragile point in the change management process (too many have&#13;
been at this for too long). We should be thoughtful of how to implement the MTR recommendations&#13;
to achieve the original goals of increased efficiency and effectiveness of the CGIAR. But at the same&#13;
time we should put ourselves on an assertive time line â&#128;&#147; so that this process does not drag out.&#13;
&#13;
(2) Center Boards â&#128;&#147; a particular attention is warranted in deciding the scope of authority of the new&#13;
CGIAR Board with respect to the Centersâ&#128;&#153; individual governance. As in any consortium or group&#13;
governance, there is real value in the individual organizationsâ&#128;&#153; Boards to manage their institutional&#13;
risks. The CGIAR Board of Governors does not want to be managing a Mexican labor dispute,&#13;
approving a land deal in Nigeria, or negotiating with a local host government of a Center. If they are&#13;
run well, the Center Boards play critical governing roles, because they have their feet on the ground,&#13;
so to speak. Weakening the Center Boards would actually weaken the practical accountability overall&#13;
of the system. Instead, there should be progress made to delineate roles and responsibilities that&#13;
are clearly articulated in a new constitution as well as mechanisms to govern, such as voting for&#13;
approval by the CGIAR Board, Centers, and decisions that are straight out delegated (with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   67&#13;
&amp;#12;concomitant accountability) to the Center Boards. The current constitution does not offer the&#13;
required clarity to cover practical guidance of the division of responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
(3) Accountability for CRPs â&#128;&#147; this should be the central responsibility of the new CGIAR Board.&#13;
Governance at the level of the CRPs and Center programs needs to be clarified to reduce duplication&#13;
and inefficiencies that supports collaboration cross-centers and partnerships. Accountability follows&#13;
the flow of funding from donors under suitable performance agreements. Currently, CRP Lead&#13;
Centers (and Center Boards) are accountable. However, this is separated from the most&#13;
management decisions of each CRP Director. Here too we need greater clarity on governance&#13;
structure, roles and responsibilities of all parties. Under the one board model, does the Lead Center&#13;
Board take on direct governance accountability, given that sub-grants to partners are managed by&#13;
the Lead Center? We need to drive towards simplicity, clarity and accountability as governance&#13;
structures are designed and learn from the experience of the past four years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               Canada&#13;
&#13;
Canada appreciates the work of the Mid-Term Review Panel and welcomes its findings gathered from&#13;
consultations across stakeholders. We are particularly supportive of the recommendations to&#13;
develop a focused and outcome-oriented Strategy and Results Framework that is at once allied to a&#13;
clear compelling vision of the mission of the CGIAR, and that identifies opportunities for innovative&#13;
finance, optimizes developmental impact, and improves thought leadership by the CGIAR with a&#13;
stronger role for the Independent Science and Partnership Council.&#13;
&#13;
In Canadaâ&#128;&#153;s view, the CGIAR needs to push forward three priorities in order to reinforce its value-&#13;
proposition to donors:&#13;
&#13;
       Strategy: First, the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s Strategy and Results Framework (SRF) needs to clearly articulate&#13;
       expected development outcomes in the long term. The SRF also needs to describe how&#13;
       outcomes from the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s research programmes (irrespective from which of the three&#13;
       Windows they receive funding) will be tracked in the short to medium term. Donors need to&#13;
       be able to gauge performance more easily.&#13;
&#13;
       Effectiveness: CGIAR should continue to improve the effectiveness of its collaborative&#13;
       research programs, including more systematic implementation of its commitments on gender&#13;
       equality and engagement with a broader array of partners, including the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
       Efficiency: While reform efforts to date have reduced multiple costs to donors involved in&#13;
       oversight of 15 CGIAR Centers, there is scope for more ambition. Further improvements in&#13;
       system-wide coherence, be it policy, operational or governance-related, would spur the CGIAR&#13;
       towards greater efficiency, as well as reassure donors that the CGIAR system is focused on&#13;
       reaping the maximum dividend from each dollar it receives.&#13;
&#13;
Following are our preliminary comments and questions respecting the consultation draft of the MTR&#13;
report:&#13;
&#13;
Prioritization of Research: The priority areas defined in the report are important to for global food&#13;
security research. Further dialogue through the process of consultation and development of the&#13;
Strategy and Results Framework in 2014-2015 would provide a constructive mechanism for further&#13;
consideration. In particular:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
68&#13;
&amp;#12;    ï&#130;·   Canada strongly supports a focus on nutrition integrated into agricultural research moving&#13;
        forward, and appreciates the focus on stunting, however we recognize that nutrition research&#13;
        may have broader impact that could integrate other measures to demonstrate progress.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Recognizing the role of agriculture in the context of both climate change adaptation and&#13;
        mitigation, accelerating progress on climate-smart agriculture is welcome.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   The focus on degraded arable lands should consider research on marginal lands rather than&#13;
        solely degraded lands, reflecting agricultural research on marginal areas that may, for&#13;
        example, be naturally less fertile, subject to desertification, or highly saline.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Disparities remain among CRPs and Centers in their dedicated capacity for integrating&#13;
        gender in research agendas. This is reflected in the limited progress by some research&#13;
        programs on these commitments; while others have more fully embraced gender equality as&#13;
        a central component of their research. In parallel with the need for improved performance&#13;
        management systems, gender should be more fully integrated into results and accountability&#13;
        frameworks.&#13;
&#13;
Scaling-Up Partnerships:&#13;
The â&#128;&#152;science of deliveryâ&#128;&#153; challenge remains undefined at the system level in so far that the CGIAR&#13;
has not articulated its approach to engaging various external partners. Canada supports the&#13;
recommendation to further define how CGIAR can more effectively engage partners outside the&#13;
system, and how it makes decisions about linking with various types of delivery agents to achieve&#13;
development outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Scaling Up Finance:&#13;
Canada supports the recommendations to pursue opportunities to scale up finance for the CGIAR&#13;
system with new and existing donors in the context of a changing funding landscape. CGIAR can&#13;
seize opportunities to improve messaging based on a shared vision and strategy, coordinate&#13;
communications, engage partners and leadership, and the explore innovative finance mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
Governance Structure:&#13;
Canada recognized the opportunities for simplifying the governance structure and improving the&#13;
effectiveness of decision-making and accountability within the CGIAR system. A stronger role for the&#13;
Independent Science and Partnership Council is a welcome recommendation to improve the rigour of&#13;
decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
In principle, we support the merger of the Fund Council and Consortium Board subject to additional&#13;
clarity on the issue of representation and management support functions to be put in place to&#13;
advance decision-making by the single Board. The establishment of a single Board should be&#13;
contingent upon:&#13;
    ï&#130;· adequate donor representation, reflecting the role of funders in supporting the CGIAR&#13;
         system;&#13;
    ï&#130;· a clear conflict of interest policy to maintain the integrity of funding and strategic decisions,&#13;
         with due consideration to the range of stakeholders proposed for membership including the&#13;
         private sector and management of CGIAR research;&#13;
    ï&#130;· maintaining the continued role of the World Bank as Trustee of the CGIAR Fund, providing&#13;
         essential technical and administrative capacities to support the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
The final decision regarding the governance structure should be contingent upon further clarification&#13;
of a number of considerations:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     69&#13;
&amp;#12;     ï&#130;·   definition of the key roles, authorities, and accountabilities of Board membership, with a&#13;
         focus on enhanced accountability and strategic decision-making;&#13;
     ï&#130;·   the proposed role of the private sector on the Board;&#13;
     ï&#130;·   the role of the proposed Donorâ&#128;&#153;s Council and CGIAR Centre Advisory Committee, including&#13;
         the relationships with the Board;&#13;
     ï&#130;·   the proposed mechanism for establishing the Boardâ&#128;&#153;s membership and constituencies;&#13;
     ï&#130;·   the legal and administrative implications of moving the Fund Council and Fund Office from&#13;
         the World Bank to an independent Board with a support secretariat possibly housed in&#13;
         another country; and&#13;
     ï&#130;·   equally, the legal and administrative implications of moving the Consortium Board and&#13;
         Consortium Office from its current status in France.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  CGIAR Consortium and Centers â&#128;&#147; Joint Response to the Consultation Draft from the Mid-&#13;
      Term Review Panel of the CGIAR Reform Recommendations (October 19, 2014)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Recommendations                                      Draft Joint Response&#13;
1. Develop a clear CGIAR Vision and Mission â&#128;&#147; A clear and       Agree. The updated SRF (to be&#13;
focused vision and mission should be developed to guide         finalized by April 2015) must include a&#13;
the decisions on priority research objectives, facilitate the   compelling clear vision and mission for&#13;
development of strategic approaches to reaching those           CGIAR.&#13;
objectives, and provide adequately detailed expectations of&#13;
results. The Panel recommends that the vision for CGIAR&#13;
be oriented towards agricultural research required to meet&#13;
immediate and long-term nutrition needs and achieve&#13;
equitable food security by 2030. Likewise, the Panel&#13;
recommends that the CGIAR mission should include how it&#13;
will achieve these short and long term societal challenges&#13;
through its mission statement â&#128;&#147; through its strengths as a&#13;
global network; a network that harnesses other relevant&#13;
capabilities from organizations.&#13;
2. Prioritize to achieve maximum impact with the least          Agree. The updated SRF should take&#13;
cost â&#128;&#147; A CGIAR task force should undertake a systematic         into consideration the research&#13;
process of prioritization, with the objective of providing a    challenges identified by the MTR team&#13;
menu of options for CGIAR and its partners to determine         as part of inputs (together with inputs&#13;
how they can maximize impacts with the least costs. This        from NARS, national policymakers,&#13;
would assist donors in identifying where they might             centers and donors, and other&#13;
achieve the largest benefits for the least costs as well as     stakeholders) when identifying priority&#13;
identify potential high risk-high reward research areas.        objectives, themes, IDOs, portfolios&#13;
The Panel identified five major research challenges with        and priorities.&#13;
potential for very high payback. The list is by no means&#13;
definitive- but this level of prioritization is needed to&#13;
sharpen focus and impact.&#13;
3. Strategy and Results Framework â&#128;&#147; The Fund Council and        Agree. One of the critical gaps in the&#13;
Consortium Board should establish clear criteria by which       current process of SRF development is&#13;
they determine whether the SRF under preparation meets          a lack of consultation with key&#13;
their needs. It must primarily enable prioritization of         stakeholders including NARS, national&#13;
outcomes being sought and consequently the research and         policymakers, the private sector and&#13;
&#13;
70&#13;
&amp;#12;partnerships required to deliver against these. This will      NGOs.&#13;
enhance stakeholder confidence in that the limited&#13;
financial resources are being used for the greatest impact,    Stakeholder consultation for the SRF is&#13;
and that those resources are sufficient for achieving the      important and it is foreseen in the&#13;
research goals. The preparation of the SRF must have           process for development of the SRF&#13;
sufficient stakeholder participation to ensure joint           between November 2014 and April&#13;
ownership of the final product. The process should take as     2015.&#13;
much time as is required to get it right. The call for the&#13;
second round of CGIAR Research Program proposals               In addition, the development of the&#13;
should only be issued after the Fund Council is fully          future portfolio of CRPs should take&#13;
satisfied with the SRF, including an assurance from CGIAR      into consideration a smooth transition&#13;
stakeholders that there is broad support.                      for any change from the existing&#13;
                                                               portfolio&#13;
4. Governance structure â&#128;&#147; The Panel strongly recommends        We agree that in principle one single&#13;
that a single CGIAR Board be established to replace the        board could be an effective way to&#13;
Fund Council and the Consortium Board and be supported         integrate functions of the Fund Council&#13;
by one Administrative Unit, replacing the Fund Office and      and the Consortium Board. The key&#13;
Consortium Office, with the aim of eliminating current         question is how this could be achieved&#13;
governance ambiguities, strengthening the ability of CGIAR     practically. We also agree that such a&#13;
to deliver its mission of research and development impact,     new board should be supported by one&#13;
and accelerating and scaling up solution-driven public-        office.&#13;
private collaborative partnerships. The Board would&#13;
establish fiduciary standards and assessment guidelines        Retaining the independent role of the&#13;
for CGIAR funded operations; criteria and guidelines for       new single Board is imperative and the&#13;
consideration of CRPs and funding proposals for new            board should be effective and&#13;
collaborative research partnerships; audit and Trustee         accountable.&#13;
arrangements; CGIAR internal policies and regulations; and&#13;
the design and operation of the Administrative Unit.           The transition process and&#13;
                                                               composition of a new board has to be&#13;
The proposed Board would need to adequately and                well thought through to reflect&#13;
effectively represent key stakeholders, with clarity on the    perspectives from donors, experts,&#13;
rationale for inclusion of stakeholders and the expectations   centers and high level individuals who&#13;
of them. Consideration should be given to the size of the      can serve as champions of the CGIAR.&#13;
Board - limiting the number of members to ensure that it is    A clear mutual accountability&#13;
manageable. This will inevitably lead to a constituency-       mechanism should be developed&#13;
based board. The Panel believes that the key stakeholders      between the board, centers and&#13;
requiring representation on the CGIAR Board are the            donors. Strong leadership of the board&#13;
donors, CGIAR centers, NARs, agricultural private sector       and supporting office must be&#13;
representatives, chief scientists, and recipient countries.    ensured.&#13;
&#13;
The Panel considers that, in order to avoid conflict of        It is important that governance&#13;
interest, the Board Chair should represent the mission of      structure changes do not disrupt&#13;
the CGIAR partnership and therefore should not represent       continuity of funding and operations in&#13;
a constituency.                                                existing CRPs.&#13;
&#13;
The Board should establish a donor council, which would        We also believe it will be premature to&#13;
advise the Board on the views of the broader CGIAR donor       respond to specific comments made&#13;
base (e.g., regarding operations, fundraising, etc.). The      by the MTR Panel about setting a&#13;
CGIAR Centers should establish an advisory committee to        donor council and other committees.&#13;
advise the Board on new advances in research, and new or       Centers and the Consortium need to&#13;
emerging challenges and risks requiring urgent action by       be involved in the design of the&#13;
CGIAR. The design of the Board should be undertaken in         organization and processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    71&#13;
&amp;#12;parallel with the completion of the SRF and the new&#13;
governance structure should be in place prior to final&#13;
selection of the next round of CRPs.&#13;
5. Optimize the strengths of partners â&#128;&#147; There is                Agree. Partner identification and&#13;
considerable room for expanding existing and establishing       management needs to be for both&#13;
new partnerships globally. To avoid transaction costs, risks,   research (including national, sub&#13;
and other inefficiencies and engage partners as equal           regional and regional entities and think&#13;
stakeholders so that joint decisions can be taken on when       tanks) and development organizations&#13;
and how to partner, the Panel recommends that the Fund          (NGOs, multilateral agencies).&#13;
Council seek the assistance of donors (e.g. World Bank)&#13;
and key organizations engaged in research with global&#13;
reach (e.g. EMBRAPA, CSIRO, and private sector&#13;
representing inputs and the food and beverage industry) to&#13;
assist CGIAR in developing guidelines for identifying,&#13;
establishing, managing and reviewing partnerships. The&#13;
guidelines should be clearly tailored to meet the strategic&#13;
objectives and results delineated in the SRF.&#13;
6. Scale up partnerships capable of tackling mega-              Agree. The new SRF and the second&#13;
challenges â&#128;&#147; Once the new SRF is adopted (outcomes as           round of CRPs should also allow&#13;
the focus) and the next round of CRP proposals (multi-          flexibility for the system to take these&#13;
disciplinary research required as a focus) are approved,        emerging mega challenges together&#13;
CGIAR should assess the extent to which its own research        with key partners.&#13;
programs and those of other leading institutions and&#13;
companies are sufficient to address priority food security&#13;
and nutrition challenges, with a view to identifying major&#13;
gaps that require new global partnerships, special-&#13;
purpose, internationally-coordinated, and long-term mega-&#13;
programs designed to solve the problems, rather than put&#13;
dents in them. CGIAR is likely to play a key role in&#13;
identifying what future partnerships are needed to tackle&#13;
the worldâ&#128;&#153;s food security mega-challenges and propose a&#13;
commensurate framework for action.&#13;
&#13;
CGIAR Centers and other potential partner organizations&#13;
need to be adaptive in how they work with partners so as to&#13;
assure their long-term relevance as coalition partners. They&#13;
will need to engage in both leadership and non-leadership&#13;
(or supporting) roles, taking on responsibilities that are&#13;
best suited to CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s strengths and comparative&#13;
advantages. CGIAR can play a leadership role by bringing&#13;
top-level global leaders together to tackle challenges&#13;
(beyond the reach of individual partners) in a collaborative&#13;
manner.&#13;
7. Scaling up financing â&#128;&#147; The Fund Council should organize      Agree. Identifying key champions for&#13;
a special session in early 2015 to discuss innovative           CGIAR is critical, and will be an&#13;
financing options, recognizing the difficulty of securing       important part of a Resource&#13;
long-term, predictable commitments to fund CGIAR                Mobilization Strategy. We believe that&#13;
Research Programs, and the uncertainties around                 a strategic role of the proposed new&#13;
maintaining, let alone significantly increasing, funding.       Board will be to scale up fund raising&#13;
Some potential approaches include development impact            at higher levels than Centers and CRPs&#13;
bonds, a capital formation investment fund, the Green           are able to reach currently.&#13;
Bond concept, public-private strategies, and pursuing high&#13;
risk-high reward impact investors.&#13;
72&#13;
&amp;#12;8. Optimize political impact â&#128;&#147; CGIAR (not just individual       Agree. Centers can also play a large&#13;
Centers) should establish specific objectives of and            role in global dialogues, setting&#13;
procedures for engaging in relevant global and regional         development agenda and formulating&#13;
policy formulations, negotiations and actions. CGIAR has        global policies and strategies.&#13;
tremendous knowledge and could contribute to and&#13;
influence international and regional policy debates on&#13;
many highly emotive issues, such as climate change, food&#13;
security, food safety, water management, fisheries&#13;
management, and the Sustainable Development Goals,&#13;
among many others.&#13;
9. Optimize knowledge impact â&#128;&#147; The responsibilities of the      Agree. Yet the periodic external advice&#13;
ISPC should be elevated to empower it to be proactive in        and evaluation (ISPC &amp; IEA) should be&#13;
terms of providing strategic guidance, foresight analyses,      complemented by a continuous&#13;
and assessing and reporting on quality of research results      monitoring and management support&#13;
across the system. The review and reporting functions           function.&#13;
should be at least as rigorous as was previously provided&#13;
by the pre-reform Science Council. It is critically important&#13;
to ensure that high-quality research review and advice is&#13;
consistently provided. At a minimum the Fund Council and&#13;
Consortium Board (and later the CGIAR Board) should&#13;
establish independent research panels comprising world-&#13;
class research leaders to advise on particular issues, as&#13;
required. A detailed proposal for the new functions of the&#13;
ISPC or its replacement should be prepared immediately by&#13;
a task force established by the Fund Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                China&#13;
&#13;
China values very much the MTR Panelâ&#128;&#153;s work on conducting such a productive Final Report&#13;
(Consultation Draft). The report findings well summarized the achievements CGIAR have made since&#13;
its reform as well as the challenges CGIAR is facing at the current stage.&#13;
&#13;
China agrees that the conception of SRF and CRPs are the most important outcomes from the&#13;
reforms and have largely improved the consistency and coordination of overall research work across&#13;
different centers.&#13;
&#13;
As a Fund Council member, China also expects to see further improvement in operational and&#13;
administrative efficiency of the system, especially for the new SRF formulation and CRPs&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
China believes that most recommendations put forward by the Final Report are appropriate and&#13;
pertinent aiming at promoting CGIAR long-term development, in particular, the finalization of SRF,&#13;
the research priorities and the partnership optimization are the most concerns from China.&#13;
&#13;
However, China thinks itâ&#128;&#153;s still need to be carefully considered and discussed regarding the&#13;
suggestion to change the governance structure, e. g. to establish a single Board replacing Fund&#13;
Council and Consortium. The current structure is resulted from a common decision made by the&#13;
majority of all related stakeholders at the beginning of CGIAR reform, and the centers and donors&#13;
have adapted gradually to this system. To establish a new governing body will not only involve the&#13;
cost of energy, human resources and expenses to form new rules, but also will probably bring&#13;
confusions to the on-going research work, which is not helpful for efficiency improvement. We believe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     73&#13;
&amp;#12;that strengthening the coordination and communication between Fund Council and Consortium&#13;
should be ideal way to improve the governance of CGIAR in spite of the fact that .itâ&#128;&#153;s not always easy&#13;
to do it perfectly.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, we have some other suggestions in terms of recommendations:&#13;
&#13;
1) For the research prioritization, we think technology transfer and delivery should also be included&#13;
since the aim of the research and its outputs should be efficiently delivered to the end users. This&#13;
also aligns in large part with existing AR4D frameworks.&#13;
&#13;
2) We think itâ&#128;&#153;s also important to enhance awareness and visibility of CGIAR initiatives as well as&#13;
publicize and highlight its achievements. Indeed CGIAR has circulated every year a large number of&#13;
very detailed documentations, including annual reports; however partners at different levels&#13;
(governments, research institutions, farmers) would expect more clear, concise and attention-&#13;
drawing messages for better understanding and time saving. Such kind of publication and&#13;
communication methods should help strengthen impacts to larger audiences.&#13;
&#13;
3) China is willing and prepared to get more involved in large-scale research cooperation such as&#13;
CRPs and expect to make more contributions to improve global food security with CGIAR. We&#13;
welcome the idea to scale up the partnerships and upgrade the cooperation with strategic partners&#13;
with great potential in order to address global agriculture challenges.&#13;

&#13;
Hon. Minister for Agriculture, Rural and Maritime Development and National Disaster Management,&#13;
Hon. Mr. Inia B. Seruiratu and myself have gone through the Final Report from the Mid-Term Review&#13;
(MTR) Panel of the CGIAR Reform, Consultation Draft dated October 8, 2014. We find the report&#13;
comprehensive and focused. We have very few observations, which are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
Pages: 7, 13, 24, 27, 28, 33, 45, 49: "Innovative Financing Options/ Approaches for Agricultural&#13;
Research." This is an important area and we feel that more discussions are needed on the various&#13;
mechanisms needed for fund generation, what are the opportunities, and how to identify them. This&#13;
is of special interest to us as we are also looking at ways to generate funds to implement the "Fiji&#13;
2020 Agriculture Sector Policy Agenda" that was launched by the Hon. Prime Minister of Fiji in&#13;
August this year to modernize Fiji's Agriculture Sector.&#13;
&#13;
Pages: 6, 7, 17, 20, 29, 30, 44, 49, 50: "Governance Structure." We agree to the suggestion of the&#13;
Panel that a single CGIAR Board (CB) and Administration Unit be established replacing the Fund&#13;
Council (FC) and Consortium Board (CB), to reduce duplication, improve efficiency and accountability.&#13;
The panel has proposed number of representatives from various constituencies and to break down&#13;
constituencies into sub-constituencies, representing the CGIAR Board. The 3 NARS representatives&#13;
from geographic areas: Africa, Asia and Latin America are mentioned. We feel at least one NARS&#13;
representative should be included/added from the Pacific Islands Countries and Territories (PICTs).&#13;
This is because there are unique and wide range of challenges and opportunities in the PICTs.&#13;
&#13;
Pages: 5 (Executive Summary), 10 &amp; Page:6: "To Create a World Free of Hunger." &amp; "Specific focus&#13;
on reducing stunting." No mention is made for Pacific Islands Countries and Territories, where&#13;
hidden hunger (nutritional hunger) and Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are of serious concern.&#13;
In PICTs populations, we should look at other more sensitive and measurable indicators of nutritional&#13;
hunger rather just than stunting alone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
74&#13;
&amp;#12;General Comments on the CGIAR/IARCs: We are of the opinion that there should be one exclusive&#13;
dedicated IARC under the CGIAR umbrella that would address the food security, poverty reduction,&#13;
sustainable management of natural resources, and improve human health and nutrition in Pacific&#13;
Islands Countries and Territories (PICTs). This would also address cross-cutting issues: gender&#13;
issues, strengthen the R&amp;D capacity of the NARSs, and integrate climate change, biodiversity, etc.&#13;
We propose it as "International Institute of Island Agriculture" for your kind consideration.&#13;

&#13;
Introduction&#13;
   ï&#130;·   FAO thanks the Panel for the report it provided, acknowledging the extensive interviews and&#13;
       the collective wisdom of the review panel, which is composed of a well-balanced,&#13;
       distinguished group of leading experts.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   FAO agrees in general with the panelâ&#128;&#153;s assessment on the achievements and the key&#13;
       problems of the 2009 CGIAR reform. We are in concurrence with the Panel, the Center&#13;
       Directors-General, and the Consortium on the key areas that have worked well, and those&#13;
       areas that have not.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   FAO considers that the MTR proposes a substantial modification on the existing governance&#13;
       structure, but fails to provide a strong analysis of potential operational difficulties and&#13;
       political consequences of such a proposal. We therefore feel that the recommended â&#128;&#156;new&#13;
       wave of reformâ&#128;&#157; especially on the governance needs further assessment and discussion.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Furthermore, FAO finds that some key recommendations of the panel report, such as the&#13;
       five new areas of research priorities, the principles and the possible composition for the new&#13;
       governance mechanism, the partnerships, and the restructured ISPC, lack a robust&#13;
       evidence-based analyses, more empirical than analytical, and hence are not sufficiently&#13;
       convincing.&#13;
&#13;
FAOâ&#128;&#153;s specific comments:&#13;
&#13;
1. What has worked well and not worked so well:&#13;
   ï&#130;· We agree with the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s assessment of the important achievements, e.g. the formulation of&#13;
     a results oriented Strategy and Results Framework, the progress of the CRPs, significantly&#13;
     increased funding, much increased collaboration of the Centers, a strong programmatic&#13;
     alignment and the shared services.&#13;
   ï&#130;· We also agree strongly with the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s conclusion on the problems of the reform so far,&#13;
     especially those associated with the ambiguities between the FC and CB, the FO and CO,&#13;
     reflected perhaps in the cumbersome relationship between the Centers and the Consortium.&#13;
     The high transactions costs of the system as a whole is another area of discontent from the&#13;
     Centers and some stakeholders.&#13;
   ï&#130;· The inability of the Consortium and the Fund Council to enact necessary operational&#13;
     guidelines and a code of conduct recognized by all partners as a â&#128;&#156;must haveâ&#128;&#157; for&#13;
     operationalizing a dual structure was a key problem.&#13;
&#13;
2. SRF and research priorities:&#13;
   ï&#130;· FAO agrees that the current SRF, together with the SRF Action Plan, served its purpose at the&#13;
      time. FAO also agrees with the Review panel that a renewed SRF needs to be developed&#13;
      before the second call for CRPs.&#13;
   ï&#130;· FAO appreciates the intention of the Review Panel in pointing out five potential areas of new&#13;
      research priorities. However, we are of the view that the research priorities will need to be set&#13;
      under the framework of the renewed SRF. The SRF should be formulated based on a solid&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     75&#13;
&amp;#12;         analysis of the challenges that agricultural research will face, the comparative advantage of&#13;
         the CGIAR Centers, and the documented needs of the stakeholders.&#13;
     ï&#130;·   FAO would urge that research priorities are not defined in isolation from the international&#13;
         policy framework and the sustainable development agenda. The priority setting on food and&#13;
         agriculture as it takes place in appropriate fora, such as FAO and IFAD, should be carefully&#13;
         considered in any research prioritization exercise.&#13;
&#13;
3. Governance:&#13;
   ï&#130;· FAO is in concurrence with the Review Panel on the problems in the current governance&#13;
      structure, and agrees that the problem needs to be addressed in order to improve the&#13;
      efficiency and effectiveness of the system. We would like to advise that in deliberating on a&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;newâ&#128;&#157; governance mechanism and structure, it should not be underestimated the processes,&#13;
      the cost and the legal implications associated with drastically changing the Consortium which&#13;
      is legally established as an International Organization under international law.&#13;
   ï&#130;· In the meantime, FAO does not find the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s specific recommendation about the&#13;
      governance sufficiently convincing at this stage, without a thorough and evidence-based&#13;
      analysis of the potential gains and risks of the recommended new structure. We are&#13;
      nonetheless open to further discussions about the optimal solutions to the problems&#13;
      identified by the MTR Panel.&#13;
   ï&#130;· In particular, FAO would like to emphasize the importance of involving the multilateral system&#13;
      (such as FAO, the World Bank, IFAD) mandated on food security and rural poverty reduction&#13;
      in the CGIAR governance. The presence of UN specialized agencies establishes a vital linkage&#13;
      and consistency between CGIAR and the international policy and normative framework on&#13;
      food and agriculture.&#13;
   ï&#130;· FAO believes that the leadership role of the World Bank, perhaps one of the most important&#13;
      global development institutions that has provided the CGIAR with consistent and pivotal&#13;
      support since its inception, in the new CGIAR governance is crucial, especially at this juncture&#13;
      of CGIAR transition.&#13;
   ï&#130;· It is not clear the expected role of the â&#128;&#156;Chief Scientistâ&#128;&#157; in the new board as recommended in&#13;
      the MTR report. What would be the role and responsibility of the Chief Scientist in the Board&#13;
      vis-Ã -vis that of the Science Council?&#13;
&#13;
4. Partnerships:&#13;
   ï&#130;· FAO finds the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s analyses and the recommendations on partnerships weak and&#13;
       disappointing.&#13;
   ï&#130;· The importance of novel and effective partnerships is indisputable. One of the key elements&#13;
       of the 2009 CGIAR reform was to remove the CGIAR annual meeting and established the&#13;
       GCARD. A close engagement of multilateral development partners such as FAO and IFAD in&#13;
       the CGIAR system is expected to contribute to bridging research with extension, policy and&#13;
       application by farmers so as to scaling up impact. FAO finds it odd that neither FAO, GFAR nor&#13;
       GCARD are mentioned in the Panel report.&#13;
   ï&#130;· FAO believes that CGIAR needs the full participation of Development Agencies and non-&#13;
       funders represented by GFAR into the Fund Council. This implies that its governance needs&#13;
       to be inclusive, not exclusive, and to provide accountability vis-a-vis both the Funders and the&#13;
       partners/beneficiaries. This was the rationale for merging the former Annual Meeting of the&#13;
       CGIAR and GFAR triennial Assembly into a single new process leading to a conference, the&#13;
       GCARD, while providing accountability to the CGIAR with all sectors,&#13;
       research/extension/education/Private sector and other stakeholders. It is disappointing that&#13;
       the MTR report does not present an analyses nor recommendation on this critically important&#13;
       aspect of the CGIAR reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
76&#13;
&amp;#12;5.    Scaling up funding:&#13;
     ï&#130;· FAO would like echo the reminder in the Consortiumâ&#128;&#153;s submission to the Panel that further&#13;
         scaling up funding will likely be challenging. The idea of a â&#128;&#156;bondâ&#128;&#157; is interesting, but lacks&#13;
         support by thorough analysis of the financing market, investorsâ&#128;&#153; expectations, the suitability&#13;
         of the CGIAR core business with such financial tools, and the potential political risks and&#13;
         transaction costs of CGIAR pursuing such directions.&#13;
&#13;
6. Role and future direction of the ISPC:&#13;
   ï&#130;· Not clear about the new direction and roles of the ISPC as recommended by the Panel.&#13;
   ï&#130;· Recall the 2008 CGIAR system review report that recommended changing the role of the&#13;
       Science Council from â&#128;&#156;policingâ&#128;&#157; to advising and helping on the research direction and&#13;
       science quality.&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions/recommendations:&#13;
FAO feels that it may be too early to draw conclusive decisions on the CGIAR reform especially on its&#13;
governance, since some of the key reform elements are still being put in place. FAO believes that&#13;
caution may be appropriate at this stage before embarking on a new, all-encompassing reform.&#13;
However, challenges of governance should be addressed based on a careful analysis to increase the&#13;
efficiency and functioning of the CGIAR system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        The Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR)&#13;
&#13;
Review Process&#13;
These comments are framed by the comments of GFAR Steering Committee members provided in an&#13;
open dialogue with the CGIAR Consortium Office during the GFAR SC meeting in April 2014. The full&#13;
Minutes of this meeting are publicly available at:&#13;
http://www.egfar.org/sites/default/files/draft_minutes_29th_gfar_steering_committee_montpellier.&#13;
pdf and these form part of the Global Forumâ&#128;&#153;s formal response to the MTR Review report, together&#13;
with the notes below.&#13;
&#13;
We are concerned that insufficient time was allowed for real consultation on this document with&#13;
GFAR stakeholders and that it was unclear whether this was a public consultation or restricted&#13;
circulation. The views of partners who were unable previously to provide direct comments will be&#13;
captured in the GFAR Chairâ&#128;&#153;s inputs to the Brussels Fund Council meeting. GFAR is also broadly&#13;
aligned with the comments made by FAO in their separate report.&#13;
&#13;
The Panelâ&#128;&#153;s emphasis&#13;
While unquestionably eminent, the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s composition was still primarily that of leading scientists&#13;
rather than other stakeholders â&#128;&#147; farmers, women, civil society organizations etc. and did not draw on&#13;
many existing stakeholder networks for inputs. The criteria for evaluation discussed still rest heavily&#13;
on traditional scientific measures such as peer reviewed publications. There is a clear message in&#13;
the review that prime partners are considered by the review to be mainly other research&#13;
organizations, including universities and large national agricultural research institutions. The report&#13;
therefore places the emphasis more on research than development, with a rather linear perspective&#13;
in its approach, which does not serve well the complex realities of development and putting research&#13;
into use for development impacts.&#13;
&#13;
The 9 recommendations of the Panel&#13;
The recommendations are many but it is not clear how general recommendations focusing on clear&#13;
vision, partnerships and innovative financing can alone achieve impact on the ground. These three&#13;
axes have long been part of the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s approach to research, but have not been well linked to&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      77&#13;
&amp;#12;effective decision making choices toward greater impact. The panel has not reviewed or suggested&#13;
measures to develop impact pathways or to measure progress towards impact, which are crucial at&#13;
this stage of the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s work. The report actually pays little attention to the importance of pathways&#13;
to impact, i.e. the key institutional relations that need to take place for outcomes of the CGIAR to&#13;
become knowledge that is used and valued in the landscapes which farmers inhabit - and which&#13;
becomes taken up into impacts. Stakeholders in the report are mentioned as â&#128;&#156;a survey of associated&#13;
stakeholders (e.g. donors, research partners, industry)â&#128;&#157; reinforcing that downstream partnerships&#13;
are not in the mindset of the panelists. Similarly the report does not describe farmers as key clients&#13;
and partners, but views them only as recipients of technologies â&#128;&#147; something that the GCARD process&#13;
actively challenges.&#13;
&#13;
The members of the panel still use the concept of â&#128;&#152;NARSâ&#128;&#153; (without defining what they refer to by this&#13;
acronym, that can itself mean several things), rather than national and local innovation systems,&#13;
reinforcing the issue that the focus is research alone and not research for development and impact.&#13;
&#13;
The CGIAR sits in a very complex system where there are many innovators, including farmers who do&#13;
not get a mention as such here, and in a world of very diverse agricultural systems where achieving&#13;
big-scale wins is dependent as much on improving farmers social circumstances as the value of the&#13;
technology. It is surprising that the recommendations refer only to food and nutrition security as&#13;
targets. What of development reducing (largely rural) poverty? Poverty and nutrition/food security are&#13;
directly linked.&#13;
&#13;
The fundamental divides inherent in the CGIAR come through strongly in the document. Is its&#13;
purpose to sustain leading edge research institutions through investments in science and using a&#13;
value system of science alone, or to contribute to development impacts by adding value to national&#13;
systems? If the latter, then capacity development must be seen as an integral development outcome&#13;
and necessary channel to achieve adoption and impact on the ground. The Panel recommendations&#13;
seem to take us back to a pre-reform stage where the focus was on research only. The vision put&#13;
forward by the Panel of orienting research towards food and nutrition security alone is surpassed in&#13;
scope and vision by the current vision of the reformed CGIAR.&#13;
&#13;
Priority setting&#13;
Optimizing impact is of course essential, but a note of caution is that this also depends on the&#13;
metrics and purpose desired. Productivity measures are relatively easy, but skew the focus of work&#13;
compared with other areas. Similarly with the foresight projections cited, no differentiation is made&#13;
on the form of food consumed, which is a poor omission when considering the future of food.&#13;
&#13;
The GFAR Steering Committee has made very explicit that GFAR, as the multi-stakeholder global&#13;
mechanism, is particularly well placed to advocate and bring these issues to the forefront at global&#13;
level. The Forum has the global reach to support processes of prioritization, mobilize support through&#13;
international mechanisms such as the G8 and G20, and connect to heads of government and other&#13;
decision makers through initiatives such as the African Agricultural Science Agenda and the&#13;
European agenda on agriculture. It was noted that these processes reap substantial benefit in public&#13;
awareness, resource allocation and establishing policy&#13;
&#13;
The claim that the GCARD process provides weak representation of partners is totally unfounded.&#13;
Over 2,000 participants from around the world and from all sectors took part in the regional and&#13;
global dialogues of GCARD 1 and the GCARD2 directly engaged over 200 relevant partnership&#13;
programmes and held major sessions on foresight â&#128;&#147; actions through the Global Foresight Hub that&#13;
are also supported by the G20 Chief Scientists. This also requires finding ways to reach and engage&#13;
the poorest farmers, which is itself challenging. The GCARD2 - foresight exercise gave strong&#13;
emphasis on farmer voices and local level actions and this should be built upon through planned&#13;
&#13;
78&#13;
&amp;#12;grassroots foresight exercises and focus on multi-stakeholder actions, with provisions of funding for&#13;
further farmer involvement in such dialogues.&#13;
&#13;
GCARD1 was ground-breaking in taking innovation systems on board, a real shift from the previous&#13;
CGIAR AGM, at which there was felt to be little attention paid to partners. GCARD1 empowered&#13;
partnerships beyond research, while GCARD2 explored links between the newly established CRPs&#13;
and other stakeholder networks and partnerships for action. GCARD3 will explore demands from&#13;
focus countries and regions for collective AR4D actions in the next phase of CRPs.&#13;
&#13;
Governance structure&#13;
GFAR supports the representation of the global and multilateral ARD system (e.g. The World Bank,&#13;
FAO and IFAD) in the Fund Council or whatever new structure could be decided, and expects GFAR&#13;
stakeholders to be reflected in any new governance system. It is surprising that the report&#13;
recommends a return to a number of flawed structures that gave rise to the reform in the first&#13;
instance.&#13;
&#13;
The real problem is how to ensure genuine leadership to the overall system. This point had been&#13;
identified during the preparation of the Reform and discussed by the Working Groups on Governance&#13;
and Partnerships, which came up with the common sense view that the SRF has to be jointly owned&#13;
by the Consortium and the Fund and that the Chair of the Fund Council and the Consortium Chair&#13;
should be clearly on the same page when it comes to strategic decisions, representation of the&#13;
CGIAR, as well as the Fund Office and Consortium Board in constant interaction and coming to clear&#13;
consensus or expressing joint decisions.&#13;
&#13;
The above considerations, the reform principles and the recent GFAR-CGIAR discussions imply that&#13;
governance needs to be accountable, transparent and open, yet the measures provide seem to run&#13;
counter to these principles and could create what seems to be an exclusive Board, without reference&#13;
or accountability to any wider constituencies. Perhaps more than ever, the CGIAR needs the full&#13;
participation of Development Agencies and non-funders represented by GFAR into the Fund Council&#13;
to link with the Post 2015 Agenda and SDGs, and be responsive to needs of the ultimate&#13;
stakeholders of IAR4D â&#128;&#147; the farmers, who are not mentioned once as partners in the review.&#13;
&#13;
The report makes very little back-reference to the rationale and strong demand for the original&#13;
reform. Nowhere is it mentioned that a major driver for the reform was the conflict of interest&#13;
perceived by funders in being asked to also directly govern programme implementation. GFAR&#13;
agrees with the Price Waterhouse Coopers report that it is not the best moment to engage the CGIAR&#13;
into a further new Reform of this magnitude. The recommendation for this major further reform&#13;
comes without in-depth analysis of the problems that have to be corrected which are partly of&#13;
institutional nature (Operational rules and definition of responsibilities between the Fund and the&#13;
Consortium, as decided in the Constitution signed by the Centers and the Consortium with the Fund)&#13;
and partly those of behaviour (code of conduct). For example, despite the clear attribution of&#13;
responsibility for the Fund Raising strategy to joint initiatives by the Consortium and the Fund&#13;
Council, the centers â&#128;&#147;and also the CRPs continue to pursue funding for individual direct investments&#13;
and projectsâ&#128;¦..However, here the funders themselves are part of the governance issue by not&#13;
adopting coordinated positions and providing consolidated funding through Window 1 &amp; 2 to better&#13;
align their own individual strategies and investments in a collaborative way. The implication should&#13;
have been the eventual phasing out of Window 3, but the opposite has happened in practice. Nor, in&#13;
practice, has the transaction cost for individual scientists in making individual grant applications&#13;
been reduced.&#13;
&#13;
There are a number of operational difficulties and political consequences that would emerge from&#13;
the adoption of the single Board proposal - the CGIAR cannot come back to such a single governance&#13;
overnight without considering the legal and political implications of eliminating the Consortium,&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   79&#13;
&amp;#12;which is now a fully-fledged International Institution established by international agreement.&#13;
Governance comparators based on other organizations are notably flawed in that they do not reflect&#13;
a basis derived from required function of the institution concerned. There is a risk of bringing the&#13;
flaws of other bodies into the system unless form follows function.&#13;
&#13;
The suggestion that the TAC should be revived is surprising, given that the Canters clearly did not see&#13;
a role for a strengthened expert scientific body at the time of the reform.&#13;
&#13;
Optimizing the strengths of Partners&#13;
GFAR does not accept the statement under 5.3 that â&#128;&#156;Other key stakeholders, such as NARs and&#13;
private sector partners, are not adequately represented, except through weak voice in the biennial&#13;
GCARD processâ&#128;&#157;. There is no evidence basis offered for this statement. To the contrary, the Global&#13;
Forum routinely solicits perspectives from a very wide range of stakeholders on key documents and&#13;
programmes and makes these known to the Fund Office and in full public transparency. Whether the&#13;
system entities choose to listen and respond to their partners is a different question.&#13;
&#13;
GFAR now directly engages large scale networks across all sectors of the AR4D continuum to impact,&#13;
including the private sector as the input sector, SMEs and food industries, advisory services, youth&#13;
and the worldâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural universities. It is a pity that the Panel did not refer to the Partnerships&#13;
Working Group report from the initial reform, the regional priority setting processes of GCARD1, the&#13;
Global analysis undertaken by Uma Lele, Eugene Terry, Eduardo Trigo and Jules Pretty, nor the&#13;
GCARD Roadmap for change which was accepted in full by all stakeholder networks in GFAR,&#13;
including the Consortium Board. Over 80% of stakeholders consulted in an external survey at the&#13;
end of 2013 considered that participation in collective actions were enhanced by being involved in&#13;
GFAR and 88% considered that the AR4D system needs to be transformed and strengthened.&#13;
Through these processes and the discussions between the CO and GFAR Steering Committee this&#13;
year, GFAR has been consolidated as a dynamic and permanent forum with direct commitment from&#13;
the CGIAR as the main tool to consult and publicly validate strategic processes such as the SRF,&#13;
CRPs, etc.&#13;
&#13;
As the review did not include GFAR in its governance comparators, we inform the Panel here that&#13;
GFARâ&#128;&#153;s governance comprises representatives directly identified by the following sectoral networks,&#13;
fora and international institutions themselves. GFAR has evolved over recent years to be truly&#13;
inclusive, with an innovation systems approach and outcome-based thinking and the Forumâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

The Centers clearly still see the new system as one of a number of avenues they have to meet their&#13;
individual goals. There is a governance failure in relation to the reform intention, whereby most of&#13;
the centerâ&#128;&#153;s budgets are still W3 and bilateral. Resources (management, physical and human) are&#13;
still allocated to initiatives that are not strictly related to the new system (CRP embedded or directly&#13;
related) and there are no penalties for this behavior. There is a Window 4 (bilateral not entering&#13;
through the Fund) that may itself run counter to the reform intention. Funders are by nature of the&#13;
issue deeply involved in continuing this divide.&#13;
&#13;
It is noted also that while there has been a very welcome increases in the scale of CGIAR funds and&#13;
of the total funding going to partner institutions within this, the intention of the reform in bringing&#13;
shared responsibility for outcomes has not been reflected in a greater proportion of these funds&#13;
going to partners:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        Year                 % of CGIAR funds to partners&#13;

&#13;
The first CGIAR SRF (based on IFPRI models) considered that a tripling of national investments was&#13;
required by 2025 alongside the increased investment in the CGIAR, if development impacts were to&#13;
be realized. Donor funding behavior and national commitments to investment in their own&#13;
capabilities have so far fallen well short of this need. The EIARD report showed that in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, CGIAR funding amounts to 12% of the total ARD public investment, but receives 2/3 of all&#13;
donor support to AR4D. Overall funding to partners through the CGIAR has greatly increased due to&#13;
the reform and this is to be welcomed. 5-25% of the total CGIAR investment now goes to partners,&#13;
yet for the Challenge programs 35% went to partners in 2007 &amp; 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Enabling environment for the reform&#13;
Change brings many challenges and it is natural that a few years into such a major change many&#13;
questions will be asked as new relationships become apparent. To some extent the system has been&#13;
left to find its way through the complexities involved. Irrespective of the future governance&#13;
structures, to support the changes underway there would be value in further capacity development&#13;
to address the required changes at many levels, inside and outside the system. Individual capacity&#13;
development would help enable research and non-research staff to adapt to the systems approach,&#13;
innovation platforms, theories of change and impact pathways and approaches entailed.&#13;
Organizational and institutional development will better enable CGIAR to successfully manage and&#13;
implement the reform and required strategic planning, review of organizational structures, levels of&#13;
authorities and work flow, aligning governance arrangements with the goals of the reform,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       81&#13;
&amp;#12;       developing performance incentives and M &amp; E approaches, use of ICT in documentation and&#13;
       communication, establishing partnership and resource mobilization mechanisms, and measuring&#13;
       impact on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
       National capacity development is mentioned, but without clear recommendations on the long term&#13;
       vision of the CGIAR and its purpose in relation to national systems, nor on the need for the CGIAR to&#13;
       clearly add value to national actors. Externally, partners and beneficiaries of CGIAR reform would&#13;
       benefit from individual and organizational capacity development to be able to take part in the&#13;
       formulation and implementation of reform plans, technology development and adoption, and&#13;
       realizing and measuring impact on the ground. CGIAR, Centers and CRPsâ&#128;&#153; capacity development&#13;
       strategies and action plans need to be developed to reflect the above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             Independent Science and Partnership Council (ISPC)&#13;
&#13;
The ISPC has reviewed the consultation draft of the final report from the Mid Term review (MTR)&#13;
    Panel of the CGIAR reform dated October 8, 2014. In general, the ISPC welcomes the proposals&#13;
    for discussion but believes that decision making will have to wait further elaboration of the&#13;
    Panelâ&#128;&#153;s thinking and intent in some areas. The ISPC appreciates the early, clear emphasis on&#13;
    international/global public goods as fundamental to the C G I A R mission. (Since there is&#13;
    confusion about meaning of that/those terms, it would be good if the final report could include a&#13;
    definition of what the MTR mean by using the term.)&#13;
&#13;
Subsequent comments follow the headings of the recommendations outlined in the Executive&#13;
    Summary of the MTR, followed by more specific consideration on the role and relationships of&#13;
    the ISPC, and, finally some clarifications on aspects of the text.&#13;
&#13;
  1.     Vision and mission are appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
  2.     Priorities. The CGIAR has had many attempts at priority setting. ISPC published a White Paper&#13;
         reviewing these in 2012. It quoted the Science Council of 2004 as concluding that â&#128;&#156;setting&#13;
         research priorities for as vast and complex an institution as the CGIAR is a daunting task. No&#13;
         approach, however complex and multidimensional, can be fully satisfactory.â&#128;&#157; From discussion&#13;
         with Centers, in 2012 the ISPC found that: â&#128;&#152;many saw the lack of high quality data as a&#13;
         bottleneck to priority setting in general, and particularly for economic assessments and&#13;
         modelingâ&#128;&#153;. The ISPC agrees. It is tempting to think that prioritization is feasible and worthwhile&#13;
         but a Task Force would not have time to report before the 2nd call for CRPs will have had to be&#13;
         published. Further thinking on processes for prioritisation at different levels within the system&#13;
         might, however, be useful. The report acknowledges that the list of research challenges given (p&#13;
         27) is not definitive and while accepting that food waste is a priority, the ISPC is not convinced&#13;
         that the CGIAR has a research advantage in that area. A focus on Big Data and informatics within&#13;
         the CGIAR is, on the other hand important for the CGIAR, but it is a research approach and not an&#13;
         outcome. In addition it is not clear whether it is the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s intent to steer the CGIAR away from&#13;
         poverty alleviation as a practical target and towards resilience since the rationale for this set&#13;
         of priorities is not given. Thus apart from encouraging the CGIAR to make choices and focus&#13;
         on the solution of big issues, it is not very clear what the MTR is trying to convey in this section.&#13;
&#13;
  3.     SRF. The ISPC concurs with the Panel that the SRF should be adequately developed to meet&#13;
         the needs of the CGIAR and that criteria should be set as to what this entails. The MTR does not&#13;
         stress impact, but importantly, the investors in the CGIAR System do want development&#13;
         impact, which means that they need to fund both upstream and downstream research and&#13;
         funding should be allocated on the basis of the strength of the proposal in terms of both&#13;
       82&#13;
&amp;#12;      science quality and relevance. The SRF therefore needs to give clear guidance on what is&#13;
      expected of systems research at one end of the continuum and of, for example, genomics&#13;
      research at the other and of the expectations as to how the potential impact from all research&#13;
      will be delivered.&#13;
&#13;
4.a. Governance structure. While the consolidation of the CO and FO to a single â&#128;&#156;CGIAR&#13;
     board/administrative unitâ&#128;&#157; has some superficial attraction, the various implications of this are&#13;
     only superficially discussed in the report. The System has recently undergone major&#13;
     governance reforms (e.g. the creation of the Consortium Office) and the establishment of the&#13;
     CRPs has also taken considerable time away from research. Large sums of money have also&#13;
     been invested in the research to date, and if investors are to see returns on their money (some&#13;
     of the research is still at an early stage), then the CRPs which are judged to be on the road to&#13;
     delivery need to be given time and a supportive environment to enable them to deliver.&#13;
     Justification for further disruption would, therefore, need to be robust. It is surprising, given the&#13;
     attention to â&#128;&#156;governance ambiguitiesâ&#128;&#157; starting on p. 20, that the MTR has so little to say (and&#13;
     no recommendations) about the number of Centers, the governance of Centers, and the&#13;
     relationships between Centers and Center Boards to the CO and FO. Whilst the document&#13;
     raises a number of issues concerning governance structure - e.g., â&#128;&#156;the authority of the&#13;
     Consortium CEO vis-a-vis the Center DGs is not clearâ&#128;&#157; - the report is not bold enough to say&#13;
     where the Panel thinks authority should reside? Similarly it points to the outcomes of the&#13;
     CGIAR governance report in relation to responsibility for CRP direction, but does not discuss this.&#13;
     Establishing clarity of this sort might help eliminate the tension and power struggles that&#13;
     currently exist.&#13;
&#13;
4.b. Governance composition. The suggestions (paragraph, top p7) regarding composition of the&#13;
     proposed â&#128;&#156;CGIAR boardâ&#128;&#157; are (to the ISPC at least) confusing and the remit of the Board is not&#13;
     clear. For the ISPC, what is needed is improvement in governance and decision- making.&#13;
     But if that is the case, how could representatives of a limited number of CGIAR Centers&#13;
     acting as Board members provide disinterested decision-making over programs on which they&#13;
     are dependent for funding? Who would decide on future calls for CRP proposals? How do we&#13;
     avoid the advocacy of the doers with a mix of decision making? Secondly, who do the â&#128;&#152;Chief&#13;
     Scientistsâ&#128;&#153; represent, since the recommendation is that the new CGIAR Board can call on ad-&#13;
     hoc scientific advice and a strengthened ISPC? And if â&#128;&#156;private sector representativesâ&#128;&#157; are&#13;
     included (which ISPC would support), then why is civil society (the voices of environmental&#13;
     organizations and social justice advocates) not represented? Yet the proposed size of the Board&#13;
     is already rather large for effective decision-making. Moreover, in the second single-sentence&#13;
     paragraph (p7), what does it mean that the chair of this board would â&#128;&#156;represent the mission&#13;
     of the CGIARâ&#128;&#157; and not a constituency?&#13;
&#13;
4.c. Governance: proliferation of advisory bodies. The report (third paragraph, p7) makes the&#13;
     recommendation that â&#128;&#156;The CGIAR Centers should establish an advisory committee to advise&#13;
     the Board on new advances in research.â&#128;&#157; Again, this does not seem to be adequately thought&#13;
     out as a recommendation in the Executive Summary, nor does the ISPC find arguments&#13;
     supporting this idea in the body of the draft report. We would suggest that further explanation&#13;
     will be required from the Panel to illustrate and justify the intent.&#13;
&#13;
5 and 6 Partnerships: it is appropriate that the CGIAR and its programs consider the best forms of&#13;
    partnership to maximize their global investment programs and to provide influence in agriculture-&#13;
    related policy fora. However, the formulation of â&#128;&#156;guidelinesâ&#128;&#157; would seem to be a fairly modest&#13;
    response to this requirement. In general the report is almost silent on 'impact'. Delivery of impact&#13;
    is very important to the donors and hence is a major issue for the CGIAR and has a strong bearing&#13;
    on how partners should be selected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         83&#13;
&amp;#12;     Importantly, under 6, why would the CGIAR endorse its own programs and only then seek to form&#13;
     mega-consortium partnership for other globally-important aspects to which it might&#13;
     contribute? Surely a genuine SRF would advocate for the areas in which the CGIAR could play&#13;
     to its comparative advantage amongst global actors and the programs should be designed to help&#13;
     formulate solutions to the major challenges, not leaving this as an add-on.&#13;
&#13;
7.   â&#128;&#156;Scale up financingâ&#128;&#157; The jargon is not evident to all readers â&#128;&#147; e.g. what do a â&#128;&#156;capital&#13;
     formation investment fundâ&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;the Green Bond conceptâ&#128;&#157; mean in this context? Nor is it clear&#13;
     how these ideas would address the fundamental challenge of funding science in the broad&#13;
     (global or international) public interest. It is harder to translate these concepts into some&#13;
     practical implications for CGIAR research. Who would provide the expertise to explore this&#13;
     recommendation and how would it be vetted?&#13;
&#13;
8.   Optimize political support. This recommendation may address some concerns ISPC raised&#13;
     with respect to the Extension proposals, recently reviewed, such as CRPs moving too far into&#13;
     global â&#128;&#156;policy spaceâ&#128;&#157;. But similarly it raises the question of staffing and budgets for some&#13;
     central body (CO or CGIAR board) to take this on. Why not see this as part of the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     collaboration with the multilateral agencies or specialized advocacy organizations and focus&#13;
     CGIAR effort (collectively or at the CRP level, as we have suggested) on providing credible, policy-&#13;
     relevant research for evidence-based decision making by the global agricultural sector? A&#13;
     clear principle for the CGIAR should be to adopt the role of honest broker between science&#13;
     and decision-making communities, including the provision of objective scientific evidence.&#13;
&#13;
9.   Optimize knowledge impact. We interpret the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s remarks on the role of the ISPC positively.&#13;
     The ISPC also interprets calls for â&#128;&#156;strategic guidanceâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;foresightâ&#128;&#157; as including more â&#128;&#156;ex anteâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
     impact assessment â&#128;&#147; but it is not yet clear whether that capacity (and those budgets) should&#13;
     reside in some executive unit (CO or CGIAR Board/unified administrative unit), within a specific&#13;
     Center or program, or within ISPC as an ex ante complement to the suite of ex post activities&#13;
     carried out by SPIA (the Standing Panel on Impact Assessment) for the system. Also as the MTR&#13;
     report seems to be describing a potentially revised role for ISPC in strategic guidance and&#13;
     foresight analysis, at the same time the CGIAR Board is also given a role in the development of&#13;
     ad hoc scientific advice. It would be helpful if the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s intent here could be clarified.&#13;
     (Additional comments on the ISPC role and relationships are expanded below.)&#13;
&#13;
References to the role and relationships of the ISPC (text section 6.9, p33):&#13;
&#13;
The first sentence of the section says that the ISPC should be enabled â&#128;&#156;to be proactive in terms of&#13;
    providing strategic guidance, foresight analysis, and assessing and reporting on quality of&#13;
    research results across the system.â&#128;&#157; The ISPC already is proactive with respect to the first two&#13;
    of these issues, working with components of foresight and not as a commissioned body on&#13;
    behalf of the Consortium or the funders. Both the proposed 'Advisory Committee' and the ISPC&#13;
    would appear to have foresight roles. The former seems to be internal and the ISPC is&#13;
    independent, but what are the delivery points for (potentially differing) advice? Who would the&#13;
    ISPC report to? At present the ISPC reports to the FC. Further clarification on the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s vision&#13;
    here would be helpful.&#13;
&#13;
The remainder of the sentence talks about assessing and reporting on quality of research results.&#13;
    This is an interesting brief. SPIA (Standing Panel on Impact Assessment) covers impact, but&#13;
    the ISPC does not evaluate the quality of the science within programs once programs are&#13;
    initiated nor does it evaluate the research results. This change could be interpreted to mean that&#13;
    the ISPC would be assessing the quality of research well upstream of where SPIA takes up the&#13;
    challenge.&#13;
   84&#13;
&amp;#12;The paragraph also talks about the need for â&#128;&#156;high-quality research review and advice.â&#128;&#157; The ISPC is at&#13;
    present quite distantly removed from the details of the science being done in the CGIAR (design,&#13;
    methods and analysis) and operates more at a strategic level, rather than carrying out&#13;
    detailed scientific review. A question for the panel is whether the IEA currently evaluates the&#13;
    science? If so, then this function might more naturally fall under the IEA.&#13;
&#13;
If the ISPC is meant to provide this kind of scientific review, then it probably does make sense to&#13;
     have â&#128;&#156;independent research panels comprising world-class research leaders,â&#128;&#157; because the&#13;
     ISPC is too small to provide this kind of detailed expertise across the range of CGIAR research&#13;
     activities, but who should they report to ensure objectivity?&#13;
&#13;
The ISPC is concerned that scientific quality across the CGIAR is uneven and in need of&#13;
   enhancement, but currently these concerns are probably secondary to the challenges of research&#13;
   prioritization, direction, and management. Scientific review will not easily address this latter&#13;
   category of challenges. And it would seem that the logical place to situate the evaluation of&#13;
   science would be in the IEAâ&#128;&#153;s periodic assessments of the CRPs. Whether the IEA should be&#13;
   under the aegis of the ISPC is a different question which is not addressed. In sum, the current&#13;
   proposals leave the ISPC unclear on how this suggested realignment of the ISPC would really&#13;
   improve the overall effectiveness of the system.&#13;
&#13;
Specific comments on the text:&#13;
&#13;
Under 4.2.4 Effective oversight, it is not clear what the panel is referring to in its equivocal&#13;
    statement on the oversight of system-wide performance.&#13;
&#13;
4.3.2 Governance ambiguities, the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s report expresses stakeholders views on the effects that&#13;
    the reform has had on Centers with rather less information on the effects on the developing CRPs&#13;
    other than noting the recent CGIAR governance report. The Panelâ&#128;&#153;s view on programs, program&#13;
    ambition and program quality are not clear and the respective role of Centers and CRPs is not&#13;
    seriously addressed in the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s report.&#13;
&#13;
Under 5.1, the text (p24) raises a number of questions, such as the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s ability to articulate&#13;
    a clear value proposition, prioritise the use of limited funds, avoiding Centers self- interestâ&#128;¦. but&#13;
    the report does not propose how these faults will be improved.&#13;
&#13;
Similarly, the items under 5.3 Systems architecture and governance are descriptors of the current&#13;
     situation which are not adequately resolved (at least as described) by the adoption of a single&#13;
     Board. The Panelâ&#128;&#153;s report is insufficient on CRP governance to see the way ahead.&#13;
&#13;
Under 5.5 â&#128;&#156;the Panel considers that the current approach leads to incremental and essentially&#13;
    marginal impacts in consideration of the complexity of food security and nutrition challengesâ&#128;&#157; but&#13;
    presents no analysis to support this view.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation 6.4 on Governance structure, (p30): The ISPC concurs with the need for an&#13;
    improvement in the setting of strategic direction and decision-making over financial resources to&#13;
    back up priorities. However, the draft recommendation for a single Board throws up a&#13;
    number of queries: details such as who would appoint the Board Chair? And, if there is a&#13;
    donor Council as well as a Board (which seems an amplification of bodies rather than a&#13;
    simplification) is there still a 'Funders' Forum'? The only significant change appears to be the&#13;
    transfer of decision-making power to a Board with an independent Chair? As noted above, it is&#13;
    not clear in the proposed formulation of a new Board how CGIAR Centers will make&#13;
    disinterested decisions over programs as part of a multi-constituency board.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         85&#13;
&amp;#12;The report refers to Chief Scientists from time to time (e.g. p32, a Task Force to be chaired by the Chief&#13;
     Scientist) and, in particular, to 'a Chief Scientist' on the Board - what constituency does this post&#13;
     refer to?&#13;

                         International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)&#13;
&#13;
    22 October 2014&#13;
&#13;
    Dear Ms Kyte,&#13;
&#13;
    On behalf of the President, I would like to thank you for giving the International Fund for Agricultural&#13;
    Development (IFAD) the opportunity to comment on the Consultation Draft of the CGIAR Mid-term&#13;
    Review, led by Professor John Beddington and a panel of distinguished international experts. We&#13;
    appreciate the hard work that has gone into the Review and we are encouraged by the Review's&#13;
    willingness to confront many of the difficult issues for the future of the international agricultural&#13;
    system. We believe that the Panel's findings can, with suitable modification, be used to strengthen&#13;
    the governance and performance of the global system.&#13;
&#13;
    Our initial comments focus on three issues raised in the Review: (a) the recommendation that the&#13;
    governance structure of the system be changed, as indicated at the breakfast meeting on Saturday&#13;
    11 October 2014, by merging the Fund Council and the Consortium Board and by creating a single&#13;
    Administrative Unit in place of the current separate Fund Office and Consortium Office; (b) the&#13;
    problem of sustainable financing for the system, especially given the uncertainties about future&#13;
    funding from the World Bank; and (c) the Review's treatment of climate finance.&#13;
&#13;
    A.      Governance Structure&#13;
&#13;
    With respect to the recommendation about the governance structure the Review states:&#13;
&#13;
    "The Panel strongly recommends that a single CGIAR Board be established to replace the Fund&#13;
    Council and the Consortium Board and be supported by one Administrative Unit, replacing the Fund&#13;
    Office and Consortium Office... "&#13;
&#13;
    IFAD supports the recommendation to establish a single CGIAR Board with one Administrative Unit.&#13;
    We believe this change will make the system more efficient and will allow greater operational focus&#13;
    by the single Administrative Unit. In our comments on the Review (attached as Annex 1) we outline&#13;
    an IFAD proposal for a single Board and a single Administrative Unit.&#13;
&#13;
    We fully understand that the submissions of the Center Directors and the Consortium Office differ&#13;
    sharply about the Single Board and the single Administrative Unit. We nonetheless agree with the&#13;
    Center Directors that the strategic vision of the system will develop best with a Single Board and that&#13;
    the development results focus of the system, in its many components, will be sharpened with one&#13;
    Administrative Unit. We hope that this important recommendation can be agreed and implemented&#13;
    quickly, given its importance to system performance.&#13;
&#13;
    B.      Sustainable financing&#13;
&#13;
    We are delighted that the Review raises a sense of urgency about the future of the CGIAR funding&#13;
    because IFAD, as do many respondents to the Panel's TOR questions, does not believe that the&#13;
    current model is sustainable or innovative enough to meet the challenges of the near future.&#13;
&#13;
    86&#13;
&amp;#12;IFAD therefore endorses the Review's plea for a special meeting to be convened by the Fund Council:&#13;
&#13;
"The Fund Council should organize a special session in early 2015 to discuss innovative financing&#13;
options, recognizing the difficulty of securing long-term, predictable commitments to fund CGIAR&#13;
Research Programs, and the uncertainties around maintaining, let alone significantly increasing,&#13;
funding ."&#13;
&#13;
With respect to the interaction between the governance structure of the system and the needed&#13;
growth of sustainable financing, we agree with the Panel's view that the current management&#13;
structure of the CGIAR does not promote innovative or sustainable financing:&#13;
&#13;
"It is the Panel's view that CGIAR has the potential to play this global leadership role {in finding&#13;
innovate mechanisms to double funding for agricultural research}, but not as it is currently&#13;
structured and managed."&#13;
&#13;
We agree fully with the Panel's conclusion that "there are opportunities for financial innovation that&#13;
could significantly leverage the current grant financing provided to CGIAR."&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, we strongly urge the Fund Council to accept the Panel's recommendation to organize a&#13;
special session, as soon as possible in 2015, to discuss new CGIAR financing options. Those options&#13;
should be presented in detail by qualified individuals with experience in development financing and&#13;
should be reviewed thoroughly by donors and other partners.&#13;
&#13;
On the basis of those reviews, the Fund council should urgently consider how to apply new funding&#13;
mechanisms - such as the use of IDA Credits, other concessional loans, venture capital options, and&#13;
the issuance of international bonds - in the second half of 2015.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Climate Finance is Development Finance&#13;
&#13;
IFAD appreciates the Panel's deep understanding of climate change, of how it affects agricultural&#13;
productivity in the tropics and of the need for the international agricultural research system to&#13;
respond to the challenge of climate change in innovative ways. Yet we believe that the Panel's report&#13;
misses a vita l issue. This issue is that finance to mitigate or to adapt to climate change is not&#13;
distinct from development finance. At IFAD, we believe that climate finance is development finance.&#13;
The problems of agricultural development, and more broadly economic growth, in the tropics can&#13;
only be resolved by a concentrated development effort, with appropriate scaling, on the core&#13;
problems of agricultural productivity, better nutrition, the empowerment of women and marginalized&#13;
groups, access to land and productive inputs, and access to markets and other opportunities for&#13;
greater welfare of the world's poor rural people. We therefore strongly urge that the Fund Council, in&#13;
its organization of a special funding session, directly link the problems of research funding,&#13;
development finance and climate finance.&#13;
&#13;
We thank you again for requesting IFAD's comments on the Panel's Report. The Report has made a&#13;
good start in defining the next phase of the reform of the CGIAR. It will nonetheless be vita l for the&#13;
success of the reform, and for the impact of international agricultural 'research system on the&#13;
welfare of poor farmers, for the reform to be more forceful and creative in addressing the issues of&#13;
institutional efficiency, sustainable financing and the necessary mainstreaming of climate finance as&#13;
development finance.&#13;

&amp;#12;IFAD, Investing in Rural People: Annex 1&#13;
&#13;
 IFAD Comments on the Consultation Draft of the Mid-Term Review of the CGIAR&#13;
&#13;
 1. IFAD staff and management have reviewed the MTR Report and have the&#13;
    following comments.&#13;
&#13;
 General comments&#13;
&#13;
 2.   The Report of the Panel has made a good beginning. The next version should&#13;
      be more specific about:&#13;
 â&#128;¢    a clearer and factual inventory of the successes and failures of the CGIAR reform;&#13;
 â&#128;¢    accountability for successes or failures of the reform;&#13;
 â&#128;¢    Specific recommendations and a calendar of implementation about the&#13;
      five research areas - nutrition, degraded lands, food waste, resilience, big&#13;
      data - advocated in the Report;&#13;
 â&#128;¢    the development of innovative funding mechanisms;&#13;
 â&#128;¢    the links between climate finance and development finance;&#13;
 â&#128;¢    the implications of a single governance structure and administrative&#13;
      unit for the system; and&#13;
 â&#128;¢    potential sources of financial efficiencies in the system.&#13;
&#13;
Specific comments&#13;
Did the MTR meet its objectives?&#13;
&#13;
System structure and governance.&#13;
&#13;
 The Report arrives at a useful recommendation about system structure and&#13;
 governance - a single Board and a single Administrative Unit -- though it should&#13;
 have been edited more closely to avoid ambiguity in this recommendation.&#13;
&#13;
 3.   The Report successfully highlights the risks to the sustainable financing of the&#13;
      CGIAR and stresses the need for innovative thinking about finance. The call for&#13;
      a special financing session, to be convened early in 2015 by the FC, is&#13;
      particularly welcome&#13;
&#13;
 4.   The Report is very superficial on system priorities, as we discuss below in&#13;
      our comments on the Report's individual recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation # 1 - Vision&#13;
&#13;
 5.   The CGIAR surely needs a vision but the Panel ought to be more specific&#13;
      about what new vision is needed to meet today's challenges.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation # 2 - Priorities&#13;
&#13;
 6.   The problem with the Panel's broad recommendations is that it implies that&#13;
      all - nutrition, degraded lands, food waste, resilience, big data - should be a&#13;
      priority in each Centre program. This is neither possible nor desirable. We&#13;
      understand that the Report does not quantify its recommendations, or even&#13;
      rank them, but it is not enough for a paper of this importance to simply state its&#13;
      preferences without explaining the rationale or the implications of its&#13;
      recommendations.&#13;
88&#13;
&amp;#12;7.   Nutrition focus is important, of course, but including a nutrition focus in all&#13;
     CGIAR research projects will cause higher transactions costs (i.e., repeated&#13;
     evaluations of the nutrition content of each proposal). The nutrition focus of _the&#13;
     CGIAR program can only be defined as a function of other efforts, mainly those&#13;
     in the countries where malnutrition is still acute. The system response to the&#13;
     MTR should therefore be to survey the nutrition content of the Center programs&#13;
     including the CRPs, and to propose changes in the existing nutrition work, not to&#13;
     follow a blanket recommendation.&#13;
&#13;
8.   The utility of the degraded lands recommendation can only be evaluated with&#13;
     respect to the opportunity costs of research on other themes. Should Centers&#13;
     working on high yielding crops in good areas switch to work on low payoff themes&#13;
     in bad areas?&#13;
&#13;
9.   Food waste is not an appropriate CGIAR research theme because it is nothing&#13;
     like a global public good. If the international community wants more work on&#13;
     food waste, it should invest in FAO and in national extension programs. It is not&#13;
     really a CGIAR issue and we would be interested what the Panel proposes that&#13;
     the CGIAR could do that is not already done by partner international&#13;
     organizations and by the national programs.&#13;
&#13;
10. Resilience is another major topic where the Panel ought to have stated its&#13;
    views more specifically on what the Centers could do to improve resiliency that&#13;
    they are not already doing. For example, plant improvement programs universally&#13;
    seek higher yields and usually seek lower variability - how would a greater&#13;
    system focus on resilience change these facts or add to what the Centers are now&#13;
    doing?&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation #3 - SRF&#13;
&#13;
11. The MTR correctly concludes that "... the lack of a high-quality Strategy and&#13;
     Results Framework (SRF) - focused on outcomes - is a key reason for many of&#13;
     the challenges facing the CGIAR partnership." It recommends that the system&#13;
     should improve the SRF, but says nothing about how this will be done. It&#13;
     further says nothing about the lengthy delays in developing an SRF despite major&#13;
     efforts among Center and CO staff to prepare an SRF, and the associated&#13;
     quantitative indicators, over the past 5 years.&#13;
&#13;
12. The MTR evidently understands the weakness of the current quality review&#13;
     processes but makes no recommendations about them.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation #4 - Governance structure&#13;
&#13;
13. The MTR correctly notes: "The two-pillar model leads to much duplication,&#13;
     inefficiency and unease, between the Consortium Board and Fund Council and&#13;
     their respective secretariats (Consortium Office and Fund Office)." It then&#13;
     recommends that the creation of a single Board by the merger of the Consortium&#13;
     Board and the Fund Council. IFAD strongly supports this recommendation. We&#13;
     outline below what a new governance structure would be.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendation #5 - Optimize strengths of partners&#13;
Recommendation #6 - Scale up partnerships&#13;
&#13;
14. The Panel makes somewhat vague recommendations about partnerships. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           89&#13;
&amp;#12;     concludes that, "in addition to the current effort to improve the strategic focus and&#13;
     results of the CGIAR system, new partnership models will be required, designed to&#13;
     optimize the capabilities and strengths of a broader range of partners."&#13;
&#13;
 15. Most observers understand that new partnership models were necessary long ago,&#13;
     but the Panel ought to have surveyed the hundreds of existing partnerships to&#13;
     assess their performance and to have made recommendations based on such a&#13;
     survey.&#13;
&#13;
 Recommendation #7 - Scale up financing&#13;
&#13;
 16. The Review raises a sense of urgency about the future of the CGIAR funding.&#13;
     IFAD, along with many respondents to the Panel's TOR questions, does not believe&#13;
     that the current model is sustainable. We therefore endorse the Review's plea for a&#13;
     special meeting to be convened by the Fund Council.&#13;
&#13;
 17. A second issue related to this Recommendation is the interaction between the&#13;
     governance structure of the system and the needed growth of sustainable financing,&#13;
     we agree with the Panel's view that the current management structure of the CGIAR&#13;
     does not promote innovative or sustainable financing.&#13;
&#13;
 18. We agree fully with the Panel's conclusion that "there are opportunities for&#13;
     financial innovation that could significantly leverage the current grant financing&#13;
     provided to CGIAR."&#13;
&#13;
 19. Therefore, we strongly urge the Fund Council to accept the Panel's recommendation&#13;
     to organize a special session, as soon as possible in 2015, to discuss new CGIAR&#13;
     financing options. Those options should be presented in detail by qualified&#13;
     individuals with experience in development financing and should be reviewed&#13;
     thoroughly by donors and other partners. On the basis of those reviews, the Fund&#13;
     council should urgently consider how to apply new funding mechanisms - such as&#13;
     the use of IDA Credits, other concessional loans, venture capital options, and the&#13;
     issuance of international bonds - in the second half of 2015.&#13;
&#13;
 Recommendation #8 - Optimize political impact&#13;
&#13;
 20. . We agree that the system could and should have greater political impact. This&#13;
     could be achieved by creating a dual structure - one pillar for policy impact and one&#13;
     for scientific impact - in the single CO. For example, the CO could appoint a Chief&#13;
     Policy Economist, would be charged with synthesizing Centre knowledge on global&#13;
     advocacy issues (climate change, food security, nutrition, degraded lands,&#13;
     agricultural trade, the use of GMOs). At the same time, the Chief Science Officer&#13;
     of the Consortium Office would focus on the quality of science in the Centers, in&#13;
     close collaboration with theISPC.&#13;
&#13;
Impact of the reform&#13;
&#13;
Has the reform developed an SRF ?&#13;
&#13;
The MTR concludes that there is no "suitable SRF" (page 47). I t i s impossible to&#13;
disagree with this and this must be seen as a major failure of the reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
90&#13;
&amp;#12; Has the reform reduced transactions costs?&#13;
&#13;
 21. Clearly, the reform has not reduced transactions costs. The Panel cites evidence&#13;
     showing that transactions costs have actually increased.&#13;
&#13;
 22. With respect to new ways of recuing transactions costs, the CO contends:&#13;
     "Jointly, the opportunity for large-scale efficiencies in the system from increased&#13;
     collective action, shared country offices and a reduced number of small grants&#13;
     has the potential to increase efficiencies and reduce transaction costs very&#13;
     significantly more than reducing the number of board members, merging Centers&#13;
     or reducing Center overheads would. Realizing this potential will require&#13;
     investments first, however." (page 45) The MTR presents no evidence in support of&#13;
     these claims from the CO, however.&#13;
&#13;
 23. IFAD suggests that the small grant problem can be solved, partly, by having the&#13;
     donors agree not to make grants less than US$0.5 million and by having Centers&#13;
     agree not to bid on grants less than US$0.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
 24. IFAD has a query about the One Corporate System (OCS). The co submission&#13;
     states that the OCS is working at 9 Centers and in the CO, when it appears&#13;
     that the OCS is not yet working in the 10 system entities cited. The next version&#13;
     of the Panel's Report might discuss this at greater length.&#13;
&#13;
 Has the reform consolidated sources of funding to the Centers?&#13;
&#13;
 25. It has not. In its submission to the Panel, the Consortium states that:&#13;
&#13;
 "... continued action (as already taken by some Centers) to reduce the very large number&#13;
of small grants in the system would reduce transaction costs significantly, and make the&#13;
overall portfolio more strategic. This was a key objective of the reform, that is, reducing&#13;
the over 3,500 bilateral grants on Center books pre-reform, to a small portfolio of large&#13;
coherent programs. While it is recognized that some small grants may well have a strategic&#13;
nature, generally speaking, a small number of larger bilateral grants (e.g., reducing the&#13;
number to 500 larger bilateral grants, plus some small grants, from over 2,000),&#13;
complementing a system of CRPs with a solid share (50-60%) of pooled W1-2 funding and&#13;
single reporting was a core idea behind the reform that still has to be fully realized."&#13;
(page 45).&#13;
&#13;
 Appropriateness of the CGIAR's goals&#13;
&#13;
 26. The first recommendation, by focussing on some low priorities for international&#13;
     research (notably food waste), shows that the MTR might consider strengthening&#13;
     its advocacy of the five new goals in light of the comparative advantage of the&#13;
     CGIAR.&#13;
&#13;
 CGIAR effectiveness and efficiency&#13;
&#13;
 27. The Panel does not make enough effort to evaluate effectiveness. I t correctly&#13;
     says that: "One of the objectives of the reform process was to reduce transaction&#13;
     costs and improve effectiveness and efficiency by simplifying the overall&#13;
     governance. This has not happened."&#13;
&#13;
 28. . The MTR concludes: "The current system-wide reporting on the results of&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              91&#13;
&amp;#12;     CGIAR research - from Centres and from the CRP partnerships - does not&#13;
     provide a clear answer as to whether CGIAR is capable of taking such a&#13;
     leadership role." The next version of the Report ought to suggest how the CGIAR&#13;
     could take this leadership role.&#13;
&#13;
 29. The MTR notes that "Many stakeholders consider that the burden of the&#13;
     bureaucracy, efficiency and transactions costs have considerably worsened since the&#13;
     reforms." The MTR continues to say "The reforms were expected to improve&#13;
     efficiency but by all counts there has been uneven progress on efficiency." It would&#13;
     be valuable for the next version of the MTR to cite examples of improvements in&#13;
     efficiency to give external stakeholders greater confidence in the reform process.&#13;
&#13;
 Panel findings on accelerating agricultural research&#13;
&#13;
30. This Chapter repeats familiar material and we have no comment.&#13;
&#13;
Panel findings on gender commitments&#13;
&#13;
31. The MTR concludes that: "Discussion with senior HR staff of one Centre revealed data&#13;
    that gender balance remains a critical challenge in terms of Centre employment." It is&#13;
    true that "gender balance remains a critical challenge" across Centres, but quoting one&#13;
    person from one Centre is a small sample and the MTR ought to have made more of&#13;
    an effort to substantiate this point. Moreover, the report's focus on gender balance&#13;
    among Centre staff is to sharp and ought to have been stronger on gender equality&#13;
    and empowerment of rural women with respect of the impact of CGIAR research outputs&#13;
    on its users and beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
IFAD proposed outline for a revised   governance system for further discussion&#13;
&#13;
32. IFAD supports the Panel's recommendation for a revised governance system and&#13;
    structure for the CGIAR. As a basis for discussion, we suggest that the outline of such&#13;
    a system might be as follows.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ A CG Assembly would be the governing body composed of representatives of all&#13;
     member countries and institutions.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ There would be one Board, called the Fund Board (FB). That FB should have 6&#13;
     "permanent" members (WB, DFID, and BMGF, for example plus 3 next largest donors)&#13;
     each serving 6 years. The 6 permanent members should be reviewed after 6 years&#13;
     to verify that they have maintained their shares of system contributions and any not&#13;
     having maintained their shares would be relegated to associate status or dropped.&#13;
     (Major changes in shares from any permanent member during a six year term&#13;
     could lead to a change in their permanent status).&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ There should be 13 "associate" members each serving 3 years; the 13&#13;
     associates would be changed after 3 years, so there would be two sets of&#13;
     associates for each 6 year term of the permanent members. The 13 associates would&#13;
     represent large national programs (Brazil, China, and India); two private sector&#13;
     members (one from Part 1and one from Part 2); 2 Center Directors (each to serve&#13;
     not more than one 3 year term); 2 Center Board chairs; and 4 significant donors&#13;
     beyond the five permanents (each to serve not more than one 3 year term).&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢ The Fund Board would have a small Secretariat, whose role would not overlap&#13;
92&#13;
&amp;#12;      with that of the single Administrative unit.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ FB meetings would be webcast live in the interests of transparency to all members&#13;
      of the CG Assembly and other global stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ The FB would appoint the CO to one six-year term, not renewable. The CO&#13;
      would report to the Fund Board. The CO would prepare a six year staffing plan&#13;
      and the FB would approve the staffing plan, including resources for consultancies&#13;
      to be commissioned by the CO as required beyond core staff of the CO.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ The CB and the FO would disappear.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ The system entities- the single Board and the single Administrative Unit -- would&#13;
      be funded by a 2% levy on W 1 and W2 contributions. A t a real steady state&#13;
      budget of US$1 billion, and a target W1/W2 share of 50 percent, the system&#13;
      entities would have a budget of US$10 million. This is roughly equivalent to 40 FTE&#13;
      staff members.&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;¢ The costs of the participation of FB members would be borne by their&#13;
      employers, as would the costs of the CG Assembly. The sources and&#13;
      applications of system funds would be published monthly on the SAU and FB&#13;
      websites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               Japan&#13;
&#13;
1.   To clarify the role of each governing body is quite important, and the recommendation from the&#13;
     Panel to establish a single Board is noted. To establish an effective governance structure, legal&#13;
     authority, TOR, member constitution, relation for each organization (structure) etc. should be&#13;
     discussed with various stakeholders including Japan.&#13;
&#13;
2.   We think donor constituencies (exemplified as 6 constituencies) should be considered the&#13;
     geographic representation and cumulative contribution including that before the CGIAR reform,&#13;
     etc. to broaden its global partnership and to provide important leadership, securing the&#13;
     coherence and continuity of the activities of the CGIAR.&#13;
&#13;
3.   To maintain ear-marked funding for the CGIAR projects is needed to secure the accountability to&#13;
     our contribution to the CGIAR. CRP is one of the most important improvements in the CGIAR to&#13;
     avoid research duplication, and each project are evaluated in an equal manner as far as&#13;
     possible regardless of the source of funding through the Windows 1, 2, 3 or bilateral.&#13;
&#13;
4.   To promote the collaboration and partnership with related organizations, such as JICA, private&#13;
     sector and other development partners. In order to disseminate and scale up the important&#13;
     achievement of the CGIAR projects, enhancing the collaboration with other partners, and&#13;
     pursuing synergy is indispensable, which would contribute to establishing the food value chain,&#13;
     and public private partnership.&#13;
&#13;
5.   The management of genetic resources and gene banks is obviously an important item of the&#13;
     MTR. Japan committed to the construction of various gene banks in CGIAR research centers&#13;
     before the CGIAR reform process started. In this context, Japan notes that Consortium board&#13;
     also thinks that the investments in gene banks is important, as described in appendix 3(pp.46),&#13;
     and would like to note the discussion between FC and CB about the new SRF(pp.29) because&#13;
     we have a strong stake in the future direction of the management of genetic resources.&#13;

Summary Comments:&#13;
The Panel has achieved its overall objective of examining the progress of the CGIAR reforms, and the&#13;
resulting appropriateness, effectiveness, and efficiency of the overall system. The Consultation Draft&#13;
of the Final Report (8 October 2014) is of a high standard. It is clearly written, concise in its&#13;
deliberations and with statements and recommendations for course correction and improvements&#13;
that are supported by evidence. In spite of the short time frame, and with limited face-to-face&#13;
meeting time, the Panel has delivered what it was asked to and should be congratulated on the&#13;
quality of the process and report. We (Pacific Donors) are largely comfortable both with the&#13;
observations and the recommendations made by the Panel. There were several issues that were well&#13;
articulated in the report that did not seem to be addressed (fully) in the recommendations. Existing&#13;
recommendations could be expanded to accommodate these issues, which include: ensuring quality&#13;
research (expanded role of ISPC in internal research review); mainstreaming gender; and&#13;
communicating with one voice.&#13;
&#13;
Comments by Focus Area:&#13;
The Panel has addressed well the six Focus Areas of the review. Brief comments on each are&#13;
provided below. The comments are initial reactions, not informed by deep reflection. More fully-&#13;
developed responses will be presented at FC12.&#13;
&#13;
1. The appropriateness of the current CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s goals and strategies in supporting the fundamental&#13;
   purpose of agricultural research to deliver development solutions needed to create a world free&#13;
   of hunger.&#13;
&#13;
     We concur with the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s observations about the deficiencies â&#128;&#147; including broadness â&#128;&#147; of the&#13;
     CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s vision, mission and associated strategies and results. The Panel recommends that a&#13;
     taskforce be established to propose a CGIAR Vision. Given the stature and diverse but&#13;
94&#13;
&amp;#12;   complementary expertise of the Panel members, it would be particularly instructive for the Panel&#13;
   to propose such a vision, as a starting point for the taskforce, if constituted.&#13;
&#13;
   The Panel has identified five â&#128;&#152;big challengesâ&#128;&#153; for the CGIAR and proposed five major research&#13;
   challenges with potential for greatest impact and payback. While these priorities may not be&#13;
   definitive, they are helpful for sharpening the focus of the CGIAR system. We support the&#13;
   recommendation for a systematic process of prioritisation but observe that whatâ&#128;&#153;s easy in theory&#13;
   can be devilishly difficult in practice.&#13;
&#13;
   The Panel proposes that development of the new Strategy and Results Framework â&#128;&#152;should take&#13;
   as much time as is required to get it rightâ&#128;&#153;. This should not be interpreted literally, or in absence&#13;
   of consideration of the consequences â&#128;&#147; the system does not have a particularly good track&#13;
   record of delivering in the absence of a deadline.&#13;
&#13;
2. CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s effectiveness in generating and delivering solutions for reducing rural poverty,&#13;
   improving food security and advancing the livelihoods of users of its research.&#13;
&#13;
   The Panel acknowledged the difficulties in finding a common truth among the variety of&#13;
   stakeholders interviewed (â&#128;&#156;where you stand often depends on where you sitâ&#128;&#157;) and have been&#13;
   realistic in what they conclude. However, only a fairly â&#128;&#152;lightâ&#128;&#153; treatment was given to the&#13;
   assessment of whether the reforms had helped or hindered the generation and delivery of&#13;
   solutions.&#13;
&#13;
   The Report usefully distilled the complex range of issues and characteristics surrounding the&#13;
   CGIAR system, including the four pre-reform principles (donor sovereignty, independent scientific&#13;
   advice, center autonomy and consensus decision-making) that have been retained and the three&#13;
   new principles introduced through the reform (separating the funders from the doers,&#13;
   harmonisation and managing for results).&#13;
&#13;
3. The efficiency and effectiveness of CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s architecture/structure, operations, and mechanisms&#13;
   for managing and funding research programs and building capacity, including its internal&#13;
   systems, risk management, governance and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
   The Panel has made insightful observations about the CGIAR architecture and structure, and&#13;
   particularly the associated ambiguities. We welcome the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s bold recommendation in&#13;
   relation to a single CGIAR Board. We do harbour some doubts about the ability of the system to&#13;
   implement the recommendation, if accepted, ahead of the second CRP round.&#13;
&#13;
   While a single CGIAR Board, if adopted, can be expected to reduce ambiguities between the&#13;
   â&#128;&#152;fundersâ&#128;&#153; and the â&#128;&#152;doersâ&#128;&#153;, it is unlikely in and of itself to remove all ambiguities, including those&#13;
   between the new Board and the Centre Boards. More critical thinking will be required. In&#13;
   addition, CRP leadership and management considerations will need far greater clarity.&#13;
&#13;
   The Reportâ&#128;&#153;s consideration of capacity building and risk management are relatively limited and&#13;
   could be usefully strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       95&#13;
&amp;#12;4. The extent and quality of partnerships within the CGIAR network and with external collaborators&#13;
   and stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
     We support the Panel findings that the increase in collaboration among the Centers (mostly as a&#13;
     result of the cross-cutting CRPs) with a sharper focus on delivering development impact, and&#13;
     increased donor funding have been among the major successes resulting from the reform. On&#13;
     the flip side (and highlighting the complexity of these issues) factors associated with&#13;
     collaboration, such as knowledge exchange and greater efficiencies, have not achieved their full&#13;
     potential.&#13;
&#13;
     While the Panel made a range of observations about CGIAR partnerships, the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s key (and&#13;
     rather underwhelming) recommendation in this respect appears to be to develop guidelines.&#13;
     Further elaboration, and more incisive guidance, would be welcomed.&#13;
&#13;
5. The structure of the Fund, the challenges of increasing the proportion of commitments to pooled&#13;
   funding (Windows 1 and 2), the prospects for firm multi-year pledges, and the roles of Window 3&#13;
   and bilateral funding.&#13;
&#13;
     The review appears to take as a self-evident truth that pooled (Window 1 and 2) funding is the&#13;
     ideal, without adequately exploring the pros and cons of Window 3 and bilateral funding.&#13;
&#13;
     FC10 Agenda Item 13 notes that, â&#128;&#152;it was also decided that the review of Window 3 be made part&#13;
     of the MTRâ&#128;&#153;. While resource mobilisation was featured in the review findings and&#13;
     recommendations, it was a shame that the use, value and future of Window 3/bilateral funding&#13;
     wasnâ&#128;&#153;t pursued in greater detail, with perhaps a recommendation provided. We would have liked&#13;
     to have seen further emphasis on this aspect to resolve the W3 uncertainty.&#13;
&#13;
6. Measures needed for the CGIAR to continue playing its critical role in global public goods&#13;
   research and national capacity building, and maintain its relevance in a rapidly changing global&#13;
   environment of ODA, more complex and crowded global research architecture, changing roles of&#13;
   public and private research investment, and ever competing demands on donor funding.&#13;
&#13;
     The document sets an ambitious yet optimistic tone in relation to tackling the global mega-&#13;
     challenges; with a clear aim to not only make a contribution but to solve the challenges. This&#13;
     approach engenders donor confidence, especially when the document calls for rigorous and&#13;
     accurate budgets to be developed for delivering the final SRF.&#13;
&#13;
Concluding comments:&#13;
In some respects, key determinations (vision, prioritisation, etc.) have been deferred, and referred to&#13;
a (proposed) taskforce, while the complexity of the design of the Board is acknowledged, but no path&#13;
forward is proposed (notwithstanding the transitional secretariat, which would provide a support&#13;
function). These are points amongst several points of vulnerability in the execution of the&#13;
recommendations. The system needs to be able to make tough choices and hard decisions; its&#13;
record to date in this respect is rather patchy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Firstly, weâ&#128;&#153;d like to thank the team for the work done. We appreciate the intentions to help the CGIAR&#13;
to develop and move forward. In this summary weâ&#128;&#153;d like to share with you our views and thoughts&#13;
that we find important and useful for further discussions.&#13;
&#13;
Vision and Mission. We fully support the idea of establishing a focused vision for CGIAR to be&#13;
oriented towards agricultural research required to meet immediate and long-term nutrition needs&#13;
and achieve equitable food security by 2030. It will also be very useful to advise ongoing work on the&#13;
SRF so that it reflects this priority.&#13;
&#13;
Prioritization. The prioritized research areas are critical and we have no objections on the selected&#13;
areas at this point. However, particularly concerning Big Data issues, existing experience and efforts&#13;
already taken by international organizations, such as FAO and AMIS should also be considered and&#13;
not to be duplicated. At the same time we need to ensure systematic process of prioritization should&#13;
be streamlined and take into account Post-2015 development agenda.&#13;
&#13;
Strategy and Results Framework. We see itâ&#128;&#153;s important to establish criteria by which it can be&#13;
determined whether the SRF meets the needs of the Fund. According to the recommendations the&#13;
research targets and indicators in the SRF should guide the individual CRPs. Taking into account that&#13;
CRPs are implemented by CGIAR Centers how does the Framework incorporate goals for the&#13;
Centers? Also we need to guarantee mechanism for encouraging Centers to follow that Framework.&#13;
&#13;
Governance structure. The transition process and composition of a new board implies significant&#13;
changes that will need to be worked out, including terms of operation. We consider proceeding with&#13;
the proposed suggestion but at the same time we need to have more clarity on the following issues.&#13;
The expected size of the proposed CGIAR Board is 20 individuals including donor representatives,&#13;
CGIAR Center representatives, NARs representatives, private sector and country representatives and&#13;
a scientist. Thus weâ&#128;&#153;d like to have more clarifications about the voting power. We need to ensure the&#13;
decisions will be made by consensus and the donorâ&#128;&#153;s opinion will be considered. Also we believe&#13;
there should be a rotation system and an opportunity to act as an observer.&#13;
&#13;
Optimizing the strengths of partners. Panelâ&#128;&#153;s proposal of using existing mechanisms of the&#13;
international society is crucial. The proposed recommendation for the Fund Council to seek&#13;
assistance of the donors and organizations to assist CGIAR establish guidelines to review potential&#13;
partnerships is, in our opinion, very promising and inspiring. Introducing new organizations and&#13;
centers in the partnership could provide various benefits, regional and global. It will also be effective&#13;
to note various organizations including regional centers, e.g. European Center for Food Security&#13;
already cooperating with ICARDA and IFPRI.&#13;
Scaling up financing. We believe that approaches to innovative financing should be defined in a&#13;
conservative manner basing on existing experience of international institutions and organizations.&#13;
Such as:&#13;
    ï&#130;· sustain financial strength over time by accessing financial resources over and above core&#13;
        contributions, without substituting for them&#13;
    ï&#130;· mobilizing additional resources cost-effectively, and seek compatibility with prevailing and&#13;
        planned administrative and financial risk management capabilities.&#13;
    ï&#130;· need to access predictable levels of funds&#13;
    ï&#130;· ensure that additional resources are mobilized in a way that contributes to long-term&#13;
        financial sustainability, and that associated risks are effectively managed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      97&#13;
&amp;#12;     ï&#130;·   create incentives for engagement with official, public- and private-sector development&#13;
         partners and contributors, improve coordination in the delivery of assistance to borrowing&#13;
         Member States.&#13;
     ï&#130;·   financial implications for the long-term sustainability must be carefully assessed, as&#13;
         assumptions and conditions vary&#13;
     ï&#130;·   take a cautious, gradual approach towards borrowing to ensure that all necessary risk&#13;
         management safeguards are in place and to secure a harmonized financial and operational&#13;
         approach.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, focusing on governmental issues, the study doesnâ&#128;&#153;t appeal to the programmatic ones.&#13;
In our opinion, the question of funds allocation between Windows should be presented.&#13;
&#13;
Optimizing political impact. We fully support the recommendation to involve CGIAR in global political&#13;
negotiations and actions. Taking part in regional forums and conferences aiming to coordinate&#13;
closely in achieving development goals and food security issues will ensure to raise both financing&#13;
and science research opportunities and advice. E.g., Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s presidency in G20 gave incentive and&#13;
basis for expanding themes of the Social Nutrition Knowledge Platform by including nutrition-&#13;
sensitive issues in the agenda.&#13;
&#13;
Optimizing knowledge impact. We strongly believe that the establishment of independent research&#13;
panels to advise on particular issues should be effective only in case of providing support and&#13;
expertise on a constant basis. Also it would be helpful to have a clarified position of the Panel on&#13;
future potential role of ISPC.&#13;
&#13;

                                                 Sweden&#13;
&#13;
Swedish (preliminary) comments on the Final Report from the Mid Term Review (MTR) panel of the&#13;
CGIAR reform.&#13;
&#13;
Firstly we congratulate the panel on an excellent report and some very sound recommendations&#13;
resulting from an analysis of the state of the post-reform CGIAR.&#13;
&#13;
We consider that the recommendation for a single board has merit, although we would have liked a&#13;
more in-depth analysis of where exactly the current two board model has failed. We also have some&#13;
concerns regarding the suggested composition of the single board. For example, the Panel suggests&#13;
at least 4 centre representatives (including at least one DG) on the single board. Whilst we are&#13;
sympathetic to the need for greater Centre involvement in governance (ref. the submission to the&#13;
Panel by the 15 centres), our concerns are that these representatives would all too often find&#13;
themselves in positions of conflict of interest e.g. in matters regarding acceptance of CRP proposals&#13;
and/or financing of these, or indeed other centre related questions such as infrastructure&#13;
replenishment. The panel suggested a â&#128;&#152;Donor Councilâ&#128;&#153; that feeds into the single Board via (6) donor&#13;
representatives which we find quite acceptable. Would not an equivalent â&#128;&#152;Centre Councilâ&#128;&#153; (viz.&#13;
â&#128;&#152;advisory committeeâ&#128;&#153;) feeding to a single DG (?) representative on the new board suffice?&#13;
&#13;
We completely agree with the Panel on the necessity of a â&#128;&#152;well thought-throughâ&#128;&#153; SRF, and that&#13;
sufficient time is given in order to achieve this. This is essential in order to prioritise research areas&#13;
for the 2Gen CRPâ&#128;&#153;s. However, we would not like to see this process drag on too long and would&#13;
expect a complete and robust SRF by, at latest, the first FC of 2015 i.e. c. May 2015.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
98&#13;
&amp;#12;One of our major concerns is the absence of any comment on the future roll of the World Bank (the&#13;
term â&#128;&#152;World Bankâ&#128;&#153; only appears three times in the main text). The Bank has been the back bone of&#13;
the CGIAR for at least the last 20 years, not only in the quantity and quality of its un-restricted core&#13;
funding, but also in its role as â&#128;&#152;honest brokerâ&#128;&#153; i.e. Chair of the FC, Trustee of the Fund etc.. Should&#13;
this omission in the report be interpreted as the Panel has acquiesced to the Banksâ&#128;&#153; CGIAR funding&#13;
exit strategy? The Banksâ&#128;&#153; presence and its role in the system gave us the confidence to make a&#13;
multi-year commitment to Window 1 of the Fund; this fact should not be underestimated. We&#13;
therefore feel that some comment from the Panel in this regard is essential.&#13;
&#13;
The above are just a few preliminary comments to the report. In conclusion, we broadly endorse the&#13;
recommendations although we have some serious concerns, particularly about some of those&#13;
regarding governance. Given the paucity of time from receipt of the report to the 20th October&#13;
deadline we reserve the right to discuss the recommendations further within suitable donor fora (e.g.&#13;
EIARD, FF and FC) and return with further comments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture&#13;
&#13;
This statement is written in response to the request for comments by the Fund Office earlier this&#13;
month. We thank the Panel for its thoughtful contribution and welcome the opportunity to reflect on&#13;
the way forward for the CGIAR. We care about international agricultural research and spend 20&#13;
percent of our investment budget on projects with the CGIAR. In the interest of readability we shall&#13;
keep our comments short, limiting ourselves to just a few points.&#13;
&#13;
Progress on reform&#13;
&#13;
There is evidence of progress in increased collaboration between centers â&#128;&#147; at a high transaction cost&#13;
and potential for ambiguity and duplication between the numerous new management structures. In&#13;
the absence of metrics, there are questions as to whether this has led to an enhanced focus on&#13;
development impact in a material sense, improved conceptualization of how to approach delivery&#13;
and the intermediation of results, and broadened partnerships that would be fundamentally different&#13;
from pre-reform days.&#13;
&#13;
The hard issues relating to the role of the CGIAR in a rapidly changing world with increased local&#13;
capacity and private sector interest in developing countries, along with the need to prioritize the&#13;
tasks, systems and technologies to work on, remain to be tackled. The declared priorities continue to&#13;
be general and broad, reflecting unrealistically wide-ranging goals and the pressures to&#13;
accommodate the system as it stands. The governance challenges identified by the Panel are part of&#13;
this picture and should be addressed.&#13;
&#13;
Looking to the future&#13;
&#13;
We would like to both caution against dragging the CGIAR away from its core competencies and&#13;
suggest the need for partnership models that permit wider benefit sharing and access to the in-trust&#13;
germplasm held by the centers, consistent with the mission and international obligations of the&#13;
CGIAR.&#13;
&#13;
We do not think outsized mission statements, mandate creep (which is still there) and the addition of&#13;
new areas of work serve the worldâ&#128;&#153;s interest or the CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s. Challenges such as yield growth fatigue&#13;
and climate change call for a focus on core strengths, which in the case of the centers with crop&#13;
mandates derive from their gene banks and breeding. There is huge opportunity and scope to&#13;
leverage this value proposition with the help of new business models, the right enabling frameworks&#13;
and strategic partnerships that we suggest should be charted out and discussed.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       99&#13;
&amp;#12;On the second point, partnerships are the tool for delivery, and the focus on international public&#13;
goods research is incomplete and unable to lead to results on the ground without them. New&#13;
partnerships can be envisaged that would involve shared innovation platforms in plant and livestock&#13;
breeding with both public and private contributors. Downstream technology dissemination alliances&#13;
could involve social enterprises or commercial aggregators who can promote the delivery of CGIAR&#13;
technology to farmers by linking it with say access to credit, extension and insurance, as well as off-&#13;
take agreements on the output side. The CGIARâ&#128;&#153;s research agenda would become responsive to real&#13;
market and farmer demand in the process, setting the stage for what one is looking for â&#128;&#147; scalable&#13;
impact pathways and widespread adoption.&#13;
&#13;
Perspective&#13;
&#13;
We believe in the continuing need and an important role for the CGIAR going forward. Governed and&#13;
managed well, with the right priorities and delivery models grounded in partnership and cooperation,&#13;
the system will rise to the challenge of making the contributions only it can make toward a world with&#13;
sustainable food security for all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                Turkey&#13;
&#13;
Over all, it is quite good.&#13;
&#13;
Only two points seem to be very important:&#13;
    1. The establishment of the Single Board. I agree with the idea, but the composition of the new&#13;
       Board will be very crucial, it should not exclude the functions and roles of the Fund Council.&#13;
    2. The ambiguity of the governance. Yes, there are some uncertainities, thus it should be very&#13;
       carefully desined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          United Kingdom&#13;
&#13;
The panel has done an excellent job in reviewing the performance of the CGIAR. We concur with the&#13;
broad direction of the recommendations, the analysis is sound and the conclusions that the MTR&#13;
panel have drawn are consistent with this.&#13;
&#13;
Governance: The overall model of governance is not functioning well, this is the inescapable&#13;
conclusion of the review and it is consistent with the analysis of the earlier PWC Governance review.&#13;
We agree that in order to deliver more effective and efficient use of resources across the system,&#13;
governance needs to be reformed to increase accountability, simplify decision-making and reduce&#13;
transaction costs. However in considering the current governance weaknesses and what changes&#13;
could be made, form should follow function. There are examples of organisations which have a single&#13;
Board but which do not operate effectively and do not deliver efficient decision-making or&#13;
accountability. Simply restructuring the Consortium and Fund Council structure will not in of itself&#13;
deliver improved decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
We agree that current system is inefficient and to some extent this is a feature of the two pillar&#13;
structure. However before making recommending wholesale change there is scope for deeper&#13;
analysis. We suggest that greater consideration should be given to the functions of a single Board,&#13;
how it would make decisions more effectively, who it would be accountable to and how would it be&#13;
held to account, and how in particular it would address the weaknesses in the current structure. The&#13;
&#13;
100&#13;
&amp;#12;risk is that we restructure only to find we are facing the same problems. Recommending, as the&#13;
report does, a Board made up of representatives of broader groups of stakeholders, each of whom is&#13;
primarily accountable back to that group, is a model which does not always guarantee effective&#13;
decision making.&#13;
&#13;
The report recommends that the restructuring takes place over the next few months. We can see the&#13;
appeal of pushing ahead with change and of ensuring ownership of the SRF and CRPs by the new&#13;
Board â&#128;&#147; if that is what is decided. However itâ&#128;&#153;s worth reflecting that the previous round of reform&#13;
took several years to complete and tied up considerable resources. There are a large number of&#13;
changes underway â&#128;&#147; the development of the SRF, the next round of CRPs commissioning, the&#13;
development of the resource mobilisation strategy, which are stretching the capacity of the system to&#13;
the limit. Rapid governance change risks overwhelming the system and delivering further only&#13;
partially successful restructuring. In proposing these changes, careful consideration to the timing&#13;
and the sequencing of this and other changes underway. Pace is good, but not at the expense of the&#13;
quality of the outcome.&#13;
&#13;
Science Oversight: We concur that overall science oversight should be strengthened across the&#13;
system. Only by identifying and commissioning the best research can the CGIAR deliver on its&#13;
mandate, and this requires the best scientific expertise. However the recommendations in the&#13;
report, which would set up an new CGIAR Board advisory committee, restructure or replace the ISPC&#13;
and set up independent research panels to advise on specific issues, seems complex and confusing.&#13;
Different bodies would be advising on different issues at differing times. We were not entirely clear&#13;
what â&#128;&#156;empoweringâ&#128;&#157; the ISPC means in this context, since it already able to operate independently.&#13;
&#13;
Prioritisation: The SRF is the basis for the prioritisation of research and we agree with the emphasis&#13;
placed in the report on getting the priorities right. Enough time should be made available to ensure&#13;
that a high quality results framework is in place to guide the prioritisation of research. Aligning the&#13;
delivery of CGIAR with a set of global priorities identified by a task force has some merit, but how&#13;
does this fit with the work currently underway to complete the results framework? The report&#13;
mentions â&#128;&#156;sharpened focus and impactâ&#128;&#157;, but it was not clear how the high level priorities established&#13;
by the task force and the on-going donor led development of the results framework are linked. How&#13;
do these priorities relate to the â&#128;&#156;mega-challengesâ&#128;&#157;?&#13;
&#13;
Competition is, in our view, the best way to drive up research standards. The report addresses what&#13;
the priorities are, but is more or less silent on the process by which research will be commissioned,&#13;
with high quality research being supported and less high quality research not being funded. We think&#13;
this is a significant gap in the report. Itâ&#128;&#153;s unrealistic to assume that all the research undertaken&#13;
across the CGIAR will be of the same excellent quality.&#13;
&#13;
Niche and Partnerships: We agree with the elements of the report which stress the importance of&#13;
global partnerships, defining the niche of the CGIAR in terms of global research capability in the&#13;
public and private sector. As part of this we welcome the proposals to establish guidelines for&#13;
working more closely with the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
Innovative Finance: We fully support the recommendation to develop a new approach to finance&#13;
which looks at a range of innovate approaches. Grant financing will continue to be important to the&#13;
CGIAR, but these new approaches have the potential to deliver greater results by linking finance to&#13;
outcomes or impact. As such we agree that they have the potential to tap into new sources of&#13;
financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  101&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            United States&#13;
&#13;
We greatly appreciate the work of the Mid-Term Review panel and welcome their insights intended to&#13;
help the CGIAR move forward. As we consider the recommendations and our eventual pathway&#13;
ahead, we would like to start with a few considerations that are important to the effective functioning&#13;
of the systemâ&#128;&#153;s researchers and the constituent centers.&#13;
&#13;
Time-limited: The last reform process was arduous and absorbed enormous amounts of time and&#13;
caused substantial disruption to the work of research leaders and researchers across the system;&#13;
any changes we make must be done within a limited time frame (we would suggest no more than&#13;
one year). USAID legal counsel notes, however, that based on recent experience with similar&#13;
changes for global organizations in Annex 5, the proposed governance modifications could&#13;
reasonably take two to three years to complete from the date of a decision to proceed, and changes&#13;
from the only recently settled reform structures could be difficult. We are concerned that the review&#13;
may have underestimated the policy, management and legal work involved in restructuring the&#13;
reforms. Thus we believe that we should explore efficiency through management changes that more&#13;
directly and quickly achieve the desired outcome of the reforms before the next set of CRPs are in&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
Decision-making: It is not clear that a single, constituency-based board would result in enhanced&#13;
ability to make difficult decisions. One of the rationales for the reform was that ExCo (stakeholder-&#13;
based) was not able to make difficult decisions. The key in our view rests in the recommendation of&#13;
the MTR that the Science Council be greatly strengthened. Independent science advice, not linked&#13;
to either program implementation or program funding remains a critical need for the CGIAR. Going&#13;
forward, the Science Council needs to be empowered to make recommendations around priorities&#13;
and strategies for CGIAR programs. Independent science advice and analysis, set out in a clear and&#13;
executable strategy, should underpin the relationship between the â&#128;&#156;funders and the doers.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Modify: Recognizing that there may be no perfect structure, but that substantial negotiation was&#13;
required to come to the current structure, we encourage the Panel to consider how to shape the&#13;
current system to achieve the goals of the Reform without a shift back to pre-reform structures that&#13;
were also imperfect. The current FC has functioned well (e.g., open, frank exchanges, effective&#13;
chairing) and contains key elements of the proposed governance structure, especially if the SRF/CRP&#13;
structure were to be carried forward more effectively.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, the creation of the Consortium and Consortium Office provides a structure for&#13;
attributing standardized accountability for execution of the CRPs, and core management, fiduciary&#13;
and other requirements for the Centers. If a decision is made to move towards a single board, it&#13;
should build on this solid base. In addition, the current Fund Council composition allows for every&#13;
fund donor to either have a seat or be represented by another donor and thus addresses the issue of&#13;
donor sovereignty. Further, for some donors, the current structure governing the CGIAR Fund (the&#13;
Fund Council) may be a legal or policy requirement for contribution.&#13;
&#13;
World Bank role: The recommendations in the document leave many questions about the future role&#13;
of the World Bank in the CGIAR if they are implemented. We strongly believe that the World Bank is&#13;
uniquely positioned to continue as chair of the CGIAR. No other relevant organization has the&#13;
convening power of the World Bank, in which most of the major funders are shareholders. Moreover,&#13;
the Bank has provided exemplary, dispassionate chairing in ways that strongly connect the CGIAR to&#13;
the larger international development agenda. Any diminution of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s role would send a&#13;
strong negative signal across the development community. Further, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s continued funding of&#13;
the system is an important signal as well. We agree with the report that new innovative sources of&#13;
funding should be pursued, but not as a substitute for traditional grant funding, and not before these&#13;
&#13;
102&#13;
&amp;#12;ideas have been developed beyond mere ideas. Traditional funding has provided the flexibility in&#13;
the system to pursue long-term objectives that could not have otherwise been achieved.&#13;
&#13;
Programmatic vs Governance Emphasis: While the MTR seems to have focused on governance&#13;
solutions, we feel the review offered little on programmatic reforms â&#128;&#147; specifically in response to the&#13;
questions in the terms of reference related to CGIAR effectiveness and efficiency. For example, the&#13;
relationship between Windows 1/2 and Window 3/Bilateral is a critical and fundamental&#13;
programmatic tension that requires attention. As we looked to the Reform to more effectively and&#13;
efficiently deliver programmatic outputs from the System, greater attention to these programmatic&#13;
questions is critical in the lead-up to commissioning the 2nd call for proposals.&#13;
&#13;
Clarified roles for Consortium, Centers and CRPs: Our sense is that the MTR judges that some of the&#13;
challenges facing the reform will be addressed by a new, single board. However, it is clear that there&#13;
are major tensions between the Consortium and the centers. If the Fund Council were to form the&#13;
foundation of a single board, could centers similarly develop closer ties to and greater ownership of&#13;
the Consortium Office? Or would these tensions then simply move into a unitary Board?&#13;
&#13;
Research Priorities: We agree with the Panelâ&#128;&#153;s attention to prioritization as a critical step in ensuring&#13;
the CG strategically contributes to research needed to achieve global food security. However, using a&#13;
lens of maximum impact for least cost doesnâ&#128;&#153;t seem appropriate for a research portfolio where the&#13;
scale of eventual impact is more compelling (while we realize for our development interventions, it is&#13;
a common and useful approach). We are concerned that it could lead to a focus on â&#128;&#156;low hanging&#13;
fruit,â&#128;&#157; and not more transformational objectives.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, there seems to be a gap between these recommendations and the factors noted in the&#13;
body of the document as drivers of food insecurity (issues around productivity, water, climate&#13;
change, for example). We hope that the executive summary can be revised to include these&#13;
compelling issues as major factors supporting investment in CGIAR research.&#13;
&#13;
We agree that the SRF should be agreed upon before the 2nd call for CRPs is released. However,&#13;
given the reality of the timing for each step in this process, we feel strongly that the current RF&#13;
(Results Framework) development process should be supported and accelerated to ensure that the&#13;
2nd Call will be timely and respond to the RF.&#13;
&#13;
CGIAR as Research Organization: We feel that the comparative advantage of the CGIAR is the&#13;
scientific knowledge it generates. Maintaining this level of excellence â&#128;&#147; while shaping the research&#13;
agenda more effectively, taking into account the diverse fundersâ&#128;&#153; and Centersâ&#128;&#153; objectives -- will give&#13;
the CGIAR a respected role in shaping world opinion on issues of food security, nutrition and&#13;
environment. It is important that the system maintains that as a base of its legitimacy in order to&#13;
convene decision makers around complex topics.&#13;

            Final report from the mid-term review panel
            of the CGIAR reform
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            CGIAR (formerly known as the
            Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research)
            envisions a world where rural poverty is eliminated, all
            people are food-secure, and even the poorest enjoy good
            nutrition and health. CGIAR is resolved to work to realize
            this vision by functioning as a unified global system and
            working with partners to facilitate more productive and
            sustainable agriculture through international public goods
            research. In 2008, CGIAR donors and other stakeholders
            agreed to embark on a change process to improve the
            engagement between stakeholders in international
            agricultural research for development, donors, researchers
            and beneficiaries, and to refocus CGIAR on the major global
            development challenges. The broad objectives were to
            integrate the work of the research centers, enhance
            collaboration with partners, ensure effective governance,
            and improve efficiency in providing and using resources. The
            key features of the reform are: (i) the implementation of
            results-oriented research focused on issues of high
            relevance to achieving development impact; (ii) the creation
            of a research environment that attracts the best scientists;
            (iii) clarified accountabilities with distinct roles for
            ‘doers’ and ‘funders’; (iv) strengthened culture of
            partnership both within CGIAR and between CGIAR and external
            entities; and (v) reduced bureaucracy to achieve greater
            cost effectiveness. The initiation of the reform included a
            decision to undertake an independent evaluation of the
            progress in three years. In mid-2013, the CGIAR Fund Council
            commissioned an independent review of CGIAR reform to assess
            progress and make recommendations for course correction.
