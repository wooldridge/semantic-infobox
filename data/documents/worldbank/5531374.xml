            Private power projects - annual investment
            flows grew in 2003
        </repnme>

            Drawing on the Bank's Private
            Participation in Infrastructure Project Database, this Note
            reviews developments in the electricity sector in 2003. Data
            for the year show that total investment in electricity
            projects with private participation amounted to US$14
            billion. Private activity grew strongly in East Asia and
            Pacific, but remained stable, or fell in other regions.
            After the boom of 1996-2000, investment flows to electricity
            fell significantly after peaking in 1997, but are still
            comparable to pre-boom levels. Annual investment flows in
            2001-03 averaged US$12.9 billion, slightly higher than the
            US$12.2 billion in 1990-95. During the boom of 1996-2000
            annual flows averaged US$29.8 billion. The decline in
            private activity played out differently across the
            developing regions. Latin America, the most active region in
            the late 1990s, sustained investment flows at levels higher
            than those of the early 1990s, while East and South Asia saw
            annual flows fall below those levels
