Health Subcomponent Monitoring and Evaluation Plan&#13;
Reliable baseline information for the 55 targeted health zones is not currently available. A baseline for&#13;
each of the ten health zone clusters, and for the project in general, will be determined during the next two&#13;
months by completing a baseline Knowledge, Practice and Coverage (KPC) survey.&#13;
An appropriate baseline survey is currently being implemented by the University of Kinshasa School of&#13;
Public Health to establish baseline in ten clusters of 60 health zones that are being assisted by the&#13;
SANRU m project (supported by USAID). It should be relatively easy to use the same questionnaire and&#13;
sampling methodology establish a baseline for each EMRRP health cluster.&#13;
In addition, as part of the contract, each development partner (executing agency) will be asked to&#13;
complete a standn3rd facilitv-based suirvey nf health centers in the targeted health zones. This assessment&#13;
will provide additional baseline information for the health facility level.&#13;

and the need for an all-inclusive, unquestionable transparency of operation and implementation.&#13;
2. Procurement methods to be used under EMRRP will be basically similar to those adopted under the&#13;
Emergency Early Recovery (EERP) IDA Grant in order to preserve uniformity of approacn. National&#13;
Regulations cannot be used under the Program since recent the Country Procurement Assessment Review&#13;
(CPAK) - carried out in May 200i - has reveaied that they are unacceptable for use under World Bank&#13;
(IDA) financed projects. A formal CPAR, including proposals for the reform of present public&#13;
procurement legislation, may be undertaken in 2002-2003. Table 1 below gives a summary of the&#13;
assessment in the case of Subprogram A and B.&#13;
Institutional (Organizational) setupfor project implementation&#13;
3. Several options have been considered, based on the basic implementation principles of: (i) achieving&#13;
fast disbursement under an "emergency" program; (ii) reaching multi-sectoral objectives and (iii)&#13;
maintaining absolute transparency throughout. Of these, the solution (agreed on by the Govemment)&#13;
which better seems to satisfy these principles while assuring gradual capacity building and transfer of&#13;
responsibility to RDC institutions and technical counterparts, is as follows:&#13;
4. A Project Manazement and Implementation Firm WPMIT), of proven intemational experience, will&#13;
manage the procurement and implementation activities of the Subprogram A (Rehabilitation and&#13;
Reconstruction of critical infrastructure) of EMRRP_ financed by IDA which will include the&#13;
Transport, Roads, Electricity, Water supply and Urban / Sanitation components. The PMIF will count on&#13;
the ncictannrp nfofpeiali7pri Terh4nwinl Cnilnternnr-t Ageypn-^iec (TCA ') ui,nh as ONATR A OT°R ,NFT.&#13;
REGIDESO, OVD and PNA. The PMIF will have full responsibility of preparing tenders, carrying out&#13;
evaluations and assure contractual supervrision of the ikplementation acP;iA es under h.e Subprogram on&#13;
behalf of the Borrower, in accordance to World Bank procurement, financial management and&#13;
disOureUOIL,1r.tL Guide; . Contractual arI.ger..erA.t fLo  A Y- will include:(i). basic ret..nunetion Flus -a&#13;
incremental success fee related to full accomplishment of the procurement activities under the&#13;
OULpUpIV6UI1, kii) a c.uVw.tiuatI UU1IaLIUII LU a jAV-knualI1cu uobLi LioI t1 aiII1o LU tInUnIate4LU focal pUo.r1t Ian.&#13;
technical staff located in each of the TCAs (a Memorandum of Understanding to be signed between PMIF&#13;
and each of 'he mnajor TCAs -w-illl cver al these aspets); and (iii) contracLual comitILment of maintainLing&#13;
high ethical standards and transparency throughout the process.&#13;
5. The "Bureau Central de Coordination" (BCECO) will manage the procurement and implementation&#13;
activities under the Subprogram B (Agriculture and Sociai sectors) ot EMK" financed by IDA&#13;
which will include the Agriculture, Health, Education, Community Development and Social Protection&#13;
components. in order to manage E:MRRp in addition to the activities under the ERRP IDA Grant,&#13;
BCECO will have to reinforce its present structure. In particular, an international staff will be recruited&#13;
as "Directeur General Adjoint en charge des Operations" and will become member of the BCECO&#13;
"Comite de Pilotage". Moreover, BCECO will have to add to its present structure one experienced&#13;
international procurement adviser and two national procurement officers. BCECO will have the&#13;
responsibility: (i) of assuring steady progress of the procurement activities in accordance to an&#13;
implementation schedule reviewed and approved by the World Bank; (ii) to make sure that the transfer of&#13;
skills component included in the contracts of each international adviser, be fully implemented; and (iii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
that an high ethical standard and transparency be maintained throughout the process. In case BCECO&#13;
would not be able to satisfy these renuirementsa nart of these responsihilities will he tranmfe.ed to PMT,&#13;
if this one is implementing Subprogram A successfully or an experienced consulting firm to be recruited.&#13;
6. Both PMIF and BCECO will be monitored and technically assisted by high level international&#13;
Procurement a.d Financial Management advisers, to the Muinist-, of Finance The ad,Asers .,.ho will be&#13;
selected through advertisement on specialized international magazines, will function as technical liaison&#13;

urgency of the emergency program, MOF will make a commitment that request for no objection made to&#13;
the World Bank by tie implementing entities triv(r and BCECO) be signed and forwarded to the Worid&#13;
Bank within a deadline of 3 working days after approval by the Advisers.&#13;
7. Given the fast track nature of the project, any delay in the steady flow of implementation will&#13;
represent a risk of cancellation of the funds envisaged under fhe Project. Planning and expertise are&#13;
therefore of paramount importance for the program. Both PMF and BCECO will submit to MOF a&#13;
Monthly Report which will describe he work program already executed and the (updated) scheduled&#13;
activities for the remaining of the year. The reports will constitute the basis for discussions with World&#13;
Bank supervision missions and the periodic meetings with the Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee.&#13;

Procuirement Cnordinntion with Donorr&#13;
8. The Program has agreat potential for procuirement coordinatfion betw een the World Bank and other&#13;
financing agencies (FAs) / bi-lateral donors. In order for a meaningful partnership to be created,&#13;
Participati.ng Parfners (PPs) howu,,evr m,ust sigm a Tn,ii, p,1l aree.ent to share:&#13;
*  a comIJIIImon work&amp; pIrogram andU sChUedufling of poUeUUmt;LIl aLcIViLIeb,&#13;
*  a common set of standard bid documents, RFP and contracts,&#13;
*  common procurement methods and monetary thresholds for the same,&#13;
*  common prior review threshold for prior review and modalities of the same,&#13;
*  to have a third party procurement audit at regular intervals (e.g. every 6 months) and&#13;
*  a common approach for communications to and fro the Client and program supervision. .&#13;
9. Moreover, is imperative that one or more of the PPs (including IDA) would take the lead in assisting&#13;
the Government to establish an experienced implementation unit(s) (as for previous paragraphs on&#13;
institutional arrangements) which will act as the Government counterpart. Prospects and arrangements for&#13;
donors coordination will be further advanced and discussed with prospective Partners at appraisal stage.&#13;
Subprogram A (Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of critical infrastructure)&#13;

general and specific notices (GPNs and SPNs) in Development Business, and international / national&#13;
newspapers of wide circulation, and pre-qualification made, simplified forms of procurement such as&#13;
Limited International Bidding (LIB) for works estimated to cost less than $2,500,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract, will be used for the remaining sections up to an aggregate amount of US$26 million. World&#13;
Bank standard bid documents, contracts and evaluation forms will be used throughout. Similar procedures&#13;
but at national level will be followed for the award of smaller contracts below the threshold of&#13;
US$500,000 for which national and foreign contractors based in RDC and neighboring countries may be&#13;
interested to bid. Advertising will be limited to national newspapers of wide circulation. National&#13;
competitive bidding (NCB) cannot be used with regularity since national regulations are restrictive and&#13;
obsolete. Simplified, possibly standardized, bid documents and contracts, reviewed and approved by the&#13;
World Bank, will be used for some of the construction and rehabilitation works up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$13 million. Smaller works of repetitive nature, with well defined technical specifications,&#13;
for works estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per contract will be awarded on the basis of&#13;
"Quotations" around a fixed budget estimate. Works which are required to either respond to the urgency&#13;
and costing US$17.5 million or less in the aggregate (for Subprograms A and B), and works which should&#13;
be procured as an extension of an existing contract, may, with the Association's prior agreement, be&#13;
procuired in accordance with the provisions of narauraph 3=7 of the Guidelines.&#13;

circumstances such as urgent repairs and emergency situations. In addition, the method may be included&#13;
into the manual of procedures for use of NGOs under service contracts. Sole source is subject to Bank&#13;
prior review in accordance to section 3.7 of the Guidelines&#13;
A/3 Consulting Services&#13;
12. Consulting services under Subprogram A will be used for a large variety of assignments to assure&#13;
high quality TA for the managing and supervision of the program, but also to build the technical capacity&#13;
of staff from various implementing agencies. In addition, consulting services will be used for priority&#13;
studies such as those for the roads and transport sectors (national strategy and its implementation),&#13;
energy (sector strategy) and water (sector strategy; studies on institutional organization; role of the private&#13;
sector etc.), etc. Consulting services under the sub-component A will include studies for sector-wide and&#13;
institutional reforms, and preparation of future programs of investment. Consultants will be recruited&#13;
through the selection methods stated in the Bank's guidelines: "Selection an d employment of Consultants&#13;

Subprogram B (Agriculture, social services and community development)&#13;
13. Most of the procurement activities under the Subprogram B will be directed towards the poorest&#13;
sections of society at both rural and urbane level. Procurement will be based therefore on simple and&#13;
speedy methods which will result of immediate use by the intended recipients.&#13;
B/lProcurement of works&#13;
14. Under the Subprogram B of EMRRP, ICB procurement method will be seldom, if ever used since the&#13;
rehabilitation contracts envisaged under the agriculture and social sectors comnonents are not larLe&#13;
enough to attract foreign contractors. Similarly National Competitive Bidding (NCB) may be used&#13;
onnne1inmili for rommn rph2hilitatinn work'c irnder the he-1th and ednr-atinn cnmnnnent, keepingr into&#13;

will be advertised on at leact two/ newspapers nf large l irclctin fin the cnintry a  nn on nffirinl hiblbletins.&#13;
Newly drafted bid documents will be used consistent with IDA procurement Guidelines. In particular,&#13;

extension of an existing contract, may, with the Association's prior agreement, be procured in accordance&#13;
with the provisions of paragraph 3.7 of the Guidelines.&#13;
15     Given the small size of the contracts, simpler methods than NBC may be used for "small works"&#13;
below the monetary threshold of US$100,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$1 million. These will&#13;
include very numerous though small rehabilitation of rural roads, reconstruction of primary schools and&#13;
A4f&#13;
,+Dr&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
health posts and floods and erosion protection remedies in Kinshasa. These contracts may be awarded&#13;
eitner on tne basis of (i) "quotations" based on a fixed-budget estimate or (ii) by using tne services of&#13;
specialized NGOs and (iii) tough "Community Participation " methods (*). Opportunities offered to NGOs&#13;
for participation to the Program wii be advertised on nationai papers and a short-iisting of NGOs made&#13;
for each contract. In specific cases, where previous, satisfactory experience exist, contracts may be&#13;
awarded under Direct Contracting (sole source) to an experienced NGO or other non-profit organization.&#13;
The procurement procedures to be used by NGOs under community participation methods will be&#13;
described in simplified manuals of implementation and subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
(*) Larger "service contracts " to NGOs above this limit are described in section below.&#13;
B/2 Procurement of goods&#13;
16.    Financing of goods and equipment under the agriculture and social sectors Subprogram allow for&#13;
an upgrading of primary schools, health posts and ministries offices, but also purchase of spare parts and&#13;
pipes for the re-establishment of water, sewerage and drainage system. Finally, under the health sector&#13;
component, financing will allow for importing badly needed supplies of medical products, condoms and&#13;
preventive drugs against the spread of HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases such as trypanosomyasis,&#13;
tuberculosis. cholera and tvDhoid fevers. As for the other Subnroaramn EMRRP will have the important&#13;
function of (i) building the technical capacity of staff from the Health and Education ministries and (ii)&#13;
undertaking of zthidieq in the field nf Agricuilhire (e co rnmmerisli7zationn  Health (refnrm of health&#13;
legislation and regulations; improvement of access to health facilities etc.) and Education (sector strategy;&#13;
reform of th.e educatiton systenm etc .). Procuiremlint r..ethods ii ill iinc-lude the use of CB r mostly for ir.port&#13;
of large packages of drugs and medical equipment, and LIB for more restricted imports of packages&#13;
below- the -hreshold of US$500,000 wen or.y a lim.ited nber of suppliers is available  e.c&#13;
product up to an aggregate amount of US$4 million. NCB may be used occasionally for contracts of&#13;
locally L,-jUlIa%.LuLu gooUd UelovW UIC uniuiviuuai L4JlluacLt value UL US$100,0eV V up .o 1  L  ar,agrega.&#13;
amount of US$1 million. As for Subprogram A, "shopping" both at national (NS) and intemational (IS)&#13;
level, mi-ay be used fur Contracts belo-w- US$100,000 in order Lo expeuite -he prucurement anu ihe delivery&#13;
of needed supplies, drugs and tools to the poorest and more vulnerable section of the society. Direct&#13;
contracting (sole source) will be used only for contracts pre-approved by the Bank and stated in the IDA&#13;
credit agreement and/or other emergency or justified reasons consistent with section 3.7 of the Bank&#13;
Guidelines. (See aiso service contracts for special cases under N-s)&#13;
B/3 Consulting Services&#13;
17     Consulting services under Subprogram B, are similar to those envisaged under the Rehabilitation&#13;
and Reconstruction of critical infrastructure Subprogram and envisage both qualified TA to BCECO and&#13;
the relevant Ministries of agriculture, education and health and the execution of sector studies and&#13;
reforms. Most of the large contracts to be carried out by consulting finms will be awarded through the&#13;
quality and cost based selection (QCBS) method. Assignments of a repetitive nature and well established&#13;
cost estimate as those for auditing services and construction works supervision may be awarded on the&#13;
basis of 'fixed budget". Most of the consulting assignments under this Subprogram are likely to be small&#13;
(below an US$100.000 individual contract) and will be awarded on the basis of the relevant experience&#13;
and qualifications of the firms (Qualifications method) and NGOs. Similarly, all contracts for individual&#13;
consultants will be awarded through a comnarison of the relevant exnerience and qualificatione submnitted&#13;
by suitable candidates.&#13;

avoid conflict with Bank Procurement Guidelines.&#13;

19.    The procurement schedule for the first 6 months of the Project and the manual of implementation&#13;
ior use of thle inmplenenting agencies will be subject to prior review, as ior Procurement Guidelines&#13;
Appendix 1, and will be considered a condition for Program effectiveness. All contracts where pre-&#13;
qualification is used and contracts for works and goods to be awarded on tne basis of iCB, LiB, direct&#13;
contracting and works contracts will be reviewed by the Bank and approved, where possible, even before&#13;
program effectiveness. Prior review will be used for all GPNs in Development Business and standard bid&#13;
documents.. All terms of reference (TORs) for consulting assignments and all contracts above the&#13;
monetary threshold of US$ 100,000 (for consulting furms) and US$50,000 (for individual consultants) will&#13;
be also subject to prior review. All other contracts, and in particular the "service contracts" will be subject&#13;

Comments: Notwithstanding the very low state of capacity, me implementing agencies nave me&#13;
potential for catching up. This is particularly true for the para-statal organizations such as&#13;
S1NkL and OR which are used to work with foreign contractors. The biggest risk is probably&#13;
political interference and recurrence of non competitive procurement practices .&#13;

1.1. The Legislation. General Findings.&#13;
The legislation relating to public procurement is based on the "Ordonnance-Loi 69-054", and its annexes,&#13;
all dated 05/12/1969. Some additional legislatinn relates to the crent.inn arnd general procedures of a&#13;

of the general administrative conditions of the bidding documents. The main findings are as follows:&#13;
(i) The qualification criteria applicable to the bidders and their proposals, are not established. Therefore&#13;
the principie of the "adjudication publique" is inefficient. 1te Ministry of Public works manages a&#13;
registration system for the contracting fi-ms but its characteristics are insufficient to be considered as a&#13;
pre-qualification system.&#13;
(ii) The clause relating to the use of coefficients to take into account the technical quality of the proposal&#13;
is not supported by an explanation on the limits and method of evaluation under this consideration.&#13;
58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(iii) There is no mention about the mandatory disclosure of the qualification and evaluation criteria that&#13;
will be used.&#13;
(iv) The conditions for a restricted process or a sole source procedure are mentioned but the monetary&#13;
thresholds are outdated.&#13;
(v) There is no distinction made for the procedures applicable to the contract for services.&#13;
(vi) The information in the official bidding document, indistinctly include the notions of Instructions to&#13;
Bidders, General and Particular Conditions; there is no reference to any general technical conditions or&#13;
accepted standards.&#13;
(vii) The legal capacity of the Tender Board (CA) includes the approvals of all management stages, from&#13;
the bidding documrents to the change orders duringr the contract imnlementation.&#13;
(viii) Although there is a clause for price revision, there is no guide to define the terms and parameter of&#13;
anP acceptbhle formula.&#13;
(ix) The bonding requirement is limited to a performance bond at 5% of the contract amount with two&#13;

T ne review of te lcegislauon wilt the nanK s uuiuelines leaus to the followmg remarks:&#13;
(i) Aithougn there is no specific restriction, tne bidder has to indicate the citizenship of his personnei and&#13;
subcontractors, as well as the origin of the proposed materials. There is no indication on how this&#13;
information will be used in the evaluation, and why it is required.&#13;
(ii) The advertisement of the invitation to bidders is only required in the official government publication&#13;
(with a minimum notice of 30 days).&#13;
(iii) There is no explicit or definite condition concerning the bidders' pre-selection on the basis of&#13;
qualifications and/or experience.&#13;
(iv) When in a restricted bidding process, the bid opening ceremony is not public.&#13;
The current legislation is inadequate, as it does not define the qualification/evaluation criteria of a method&#13;
of selection conducive to the best economical result. The terms and conditions are indefinite and&#13;
incomplete to insure a rigorous, transparent and equitable process of evaluation. However, the needed&#13;
amendments do not require a full revision of the text as far as the bidding documents' contents are&#13;
concerned.&#13;
1.3. Structure of implementation&#13;
The management structure for the nrocurement nrocedures are heavily centralized on the role of the&#13;
Tender Board, the "Conseil des Adjudications" (CA), even if provisions are made for provincial and local&#13;
boards. The Board interventinn is reniunred for the innrovsvls of the bidding dnocrnmentcs parckapg the&#13;
contracts awards and for any change orders to the scope of works modifying the contract amount. The&#13;

Tne legislation makes provision for tLe Administration beneficiary of the contract to be the awarding&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
For all contracts for construction works and related equipment and services, the Ministry of Public Works&#13;
2nd TLnd M,^nagement (MTPAT) is the designated contracting party.&#13;
The legislation also mr.akes provisIon fora "Conseil Superie-r des Adjudications"n a ,cnntrol o.nmmission&#13;

related chain of command.&#13;
The facts such as:&#13;
(1) lack of precision of the texts (for instance absence of connection between the initiation of the&#13;
procurement procedures and the planning and budget functions, indefinite provision relating to the&#13;
evaluation of the technical quality of proposals, the lack of qualifications criteria,...);&#13;
(2) lack of precision in the definition of the limits of authority in the managing organization;&#13;
(3) excessive centralization of power in approval and award matters;&#13;
make that when faced to a deficiency in the legislation (such as the outdated thresholds defining the&#13;
applicable types of procurement procedures), or the weakness of a control unit (Direction des Marches&#13;
Publics), the conditions are met to allow for the ignorance of the law, or the will to ignore it, to let&#13;
establish non compliant procedures in the management of public funds.&#13;
As an example, it is current practice that the Administration beneficiaries of the contract have recourse to&#13;
an offical authorization to derogate to the legal competitive procedure through the issuance of a "Decision&#13;
de non-recours a l'adjudication publique", that they grant to themselves, to enter into a single-source&#13;
selection of contractors or suppliers. The ensuing agreement is executed without any coordination with&#13;
other relevant government instances that would justify the commitment with regards to an overall&#13;
npanning and hudget allowance. This generates a de fna^tn sitmation that the Ministry nf Finances mav&#13;
(with a "regularization" afterwards) or may not, approve when the first payment is due. Although there is&#13;

Government has never proceeded with the advance payment (the contractual advance payments have&#13;
reached 800% and even 100% of the contract amo---t,,thout any banb garantie). 'ni other cases, "he&#13;
advance payment could have been paid but there was no evidence of an approval of the quality or&#13;

during the year 2000: 7i contracts for worKs, witn 10 oI thnem reguiarly awarded or regularized&#13;
afterwards, and 61 irregularly awarded contracts. The other 92 contracts, all relating to the purchase of&#13;
goods, include 13 regular contracts and 79 irreguiar contracts. About 30% of the signed contracts&#13;
generated disbursements. There is no implementation of a record or statistics procedure, during the&#13;
procurement or the contract management phases.&#13;
The control commission "Conseil Superieur des Adjudications", provided by law, was never created.&#13;
Important Note:&#13;
60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The prevalent situation of a supposedly large number of signed contracts, never activated by the advance&#13;
payment, constitutes a potential of claims that no statistics allow to evaluate. A procedure of termination&#13;
of these contracts should be implemented.&#13;
1.5. Recommendations.&#13;
1.5.1. Revision of legal documents&#13;
The findings resulting of the examination of the legal documents show the necessity to proceed with an&#13;
UpUda. andu a iMvibiuii VI  .exts.&#13;
First, the revision should be made in order to correct the cited deficiencies and to establish updated&#13;
monetary thresholds along with a formula of price revision taking into account the evolution of the local&#13;
currency.  And then, to revise the texi to empnasize me alspositions conaucive to the oDjectve oI&#13;
transparency and fair opportunity for all firms. This objective will be best served by an open competitive&#13;
bidding system that includes the quailification criteria applicable to the bidders and their proposais. It wii&#13;
be essential that these conditions for qualification, be based on measurable criteria leading to the&#13;
maximum of objectivity in the evaluation process. The required information would then essentially&#13;
address the bidders' capacity in terms of equipments, the experience of his key-personnel designated for&#13;
the contract implementation, his financial capacity to face his obligations, either through bonding and/or&#13;
his own cash availability.&#13;
If the technology is defined, the bidding documents will impose the minimal equipment characteristics in&#13;
order to satisfy the required level of production and work progress. And in the other cases, the documents&#13;
will require from the bidder to justify the adequate correlation between his equipment, his crews and his&#13;
proposed progress schedule.&#13;
The experience may also be stated in measurable terms for the project manager and the supervisor, in&#13;
relation to the specific type of works to carry out.&#13;
The financial capacity must be demonstrated on the basis of audited statements or adequate bank&#13;
certificationm Other criteria of administrative tyvne shnuld be limited to the required declarations allowing&#13;
for a contract relationship with the Government, such as a fiscal declaration, and a certificate of good&#13;
stnnding wuith the Social Security administration. These latter doc-umpentz .may only be required from the&#13;
selected bidder to be delivered in a prescribed period before signing the contract. A bid bond would then&#13;
be usefu!.&#13;

would favor the principle of economy while bringing more trust of the bidders in the fairness of the&#13;
pr-ocedure&#13;
1.5.2. The functional structure in the decision making process&#13;
Tne adaptation of the existing structures leading to better procurement and contract management&#13;
procedures can only occur in the wider context of a general institutional reinforcing. The connexion&#13;
between the functions of planning, budgeting, management and control, must be reinstated in an&#13;
environment of responsible management with the help of a modem information system.&#13;
As far as the procurement management is concerned, the award decision, currently relevant to the Tender&#13;
Board, should only be the conclusion of successive phases implying for each of them, an appropriate level&#13;
of accountable decisions. They are, in a first approach, the budget allowance, the definition of the scope&#13;
611&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of work with its description (which will necessitate in most cases, a service contract for the studies and&#13;
desion), a reliable estimate, a "npersonn.alized" composition of the bidding documents, the mnagem. ent of&#13;
the bidding period, the different stages of the bids analysis and evaluation, and finally, a formal&#13;
proposition b- an avar., cotn ,nittee. T.hs n,hn1A -orl nrepr.nrg -h-e oi+ror stage car only be validly&#13;

actors in the process, including those involved in the ensuing phase of the contract management during&#13;
ineir impiementaiion.&#13;
It is however necessary to establish an specific organization and a rigorous mechanism of internai controi&#13;
to insure the integrity of the process. This organization would have all the necessary power to verify the&#13;
compliance of the procurement procedures through a full review of all imposed documents justifying each&#13;
decision as they were taken at each step of the procedure. These documents should be established under a&#13;
standard format, to facilitate the control and make any unjustified interference more obvious, and&#13;
therefore less likely to occur.&#13;
The phase of actual contract management is critical to insure the credibility of the system. And therefore,&#13;
the team in charge of the implementation should acquire the means for an efficient supervision of the&#13;
quality and quantity surveys, especially with a sub-contracted service of supervision by a consultant&#13;
expert, and the leadership of project managers, agent of the Government, adequately equiped for frequent&#13;
participation to job meetings, and with the adequate authority and compensation, appropriate to a high&#13;
level of accountability.&#13;
Among the necessary tools for an efficient follow-up, a computerized Management Information System&#13;
will allow for the permanent updates of the accounting and budget data. bringing at least a monthly&#13;
review of the management parameters and possibly guide any executive decision of corrective actions.&#13;
The contract manngement will also couints on the t-ools nf finqnc-iA cantrnl to be put in place, such aS A&#13;
rigorous and minimal circuit of payments approval, an adequate management of bank guaranties or bonds,&#13;
and a syst.em of budget forecast.&#13;

the coordination of the following phases:&#13;

5. Redefine the limits and procedures of interactions with the overseeing ministries.&#13;
1.6. The case of the Public Enterprises&#13;
The legislation makes provisions for a decentralized status applicable to some public enterprises. Some&#13;
decrees have allowed the creation of award committees inside the public enterprises organizations. The&#13;
contracting party remaining in some cases their overseeing ministry. The management of procedures by&#13;
some of these entities has been reviewed through interviews with their staff and the review of relevant&#13;
documents supporting the phases of procurement management.&#13;
As the structure of the public enterprises has an autonomous status and is more oriented to address the&#13;
technical problems connected with their role, the public enterprises are in a position to efficiently manage&#13;
their prnodrement procedure,. Their interactions with the npanning and budget denartment of their&#13;
overseeing ministries, as well as the respective roles in the decision process with these ministries,&#13;
generally need to be fiirthpr defined.&#13;

model of management. The competence and experience of the staff constitute an asset in the contemplated&#13;
effort of making the organization more efficient through the reinforcement and the capacity buiiding of&#13;
the institutions.&#13;
1.6.2. "REGIDESO"&#13;
The Regideso, being overseen by the Ministry of Energy, received its status of public enterprise by the&#13;
Decree 78-197 on May 5, 1978. The statutes make provisions for the competence in managing the&#13;
procurement of works and goods, with an internal award committee (Comite de Gestion). The&#13;
propositions by this committee are submitted to the Minister of the Energy, but the Regideso signs their&#13;
own contracts, fully acting as an implementation agency and as the Government's Representative. The&#13;
Direction for Developments provides the technical expertise in the contract management. The&#13;
organization includes about 4700 agents, half of them in Kinshasa, and the other in the provincial&#13;
agencies. Before the suspension of the international financing, the annual budget was between the&#13;
enuivalent of 30 to 40 millions of US Dollars. The water production in the Kinshasa area is 350000 m3&#13;
per day with 3 units of production, and for a population of about 6 millions. The most urgent need is the&#13;
rehabilitatinn of the secondary and tertiary distribution network where the current level of output is&#13;
estimated to be 60% of the production. The organization includes a department of studies and a&#13;

agents, 2500 of them in the central administration in Kinshasa. A division of planning, research and&#13;
development is specially in charge of defining the needs and prospective projects, and to evaluate their&#13;
feasibility and planning of implementation. A division in charge of the equipment provides the- design,&#13;
specifications and other technical information, and finally, a division of purchasing manages the&#13;
procurement procedures. This division has currently 53 employees and has managed between 300 and&#13;
350 procedures during the year 2000, with an average of 4 competitive bidding per month and a large&#13;
number of contracts for the acquisitions of small equipment on the local market. There is no stock of&#13;
snare narts and the nurchases are made as needed. The Drocurement nrocedures are made in accordance&#13;
with the legislation of 1969. The qualification criteria for the bidders include their financial capacity, but&#13;
the bidding documents do not state the minirnal reqUirementq expnc-ted. There is a register nf 4AetTicrl&#13;

OILatra, is a public eLterprLise under the Ministry of Tlranlspor by Dec-ree 78-206 of VIay 5, 1978. It&#13;
includes 5 operational departments: the sea ports, the railways (Line Matadi-Kinshasa and urban lines in&#13;
Kinshasa), the port of Kinshasa, fiuvial ports and transportation system, 3 snip yards. Tnere are five&#13;
additional departments for technical and administrative support and a commercial direction. The company&#13;
employs about 13000 persons and manages the pension funds of an additional 9000 retired empioyees.&#13;
The procurement management is handled by each operational division for their own local acquisitions and&#13;
by a centralized department as far as imported goods are concerned. ONATRA signs its own contracts&#13;
and the Ministry's approval is required when the contract amount exceeds the equivalent of $100,000&#13;
USD.&#13;
1.7. The Contract Management Functions by the Ministries&#13;
As indicated above, according to the legislation, all procurement of works, goods and services except for&#13;
the Public Enterprises, implies the control and approval of the Tender Board. Two typical situations&#13;
present themselves according to the nature of contract and the authority of the beneficiaries. This&#13;
paragraph examines these situations in the lights of the information gathered from the Ministry of Public&#13;
Works and Land Management, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education.&#13;
The Ministry of Public Works and Land Management (MTPAT) is effectively the Representative entity&#13;
for the Government. for any construction works relating to the nublic infrastructure: the MTPAT is in&#13;
charge of the technical management of the real estate asset of the State. The MTPAT organization&#13;
innhludes seven T)irections:&#13;

The whole MTPAT structure covers its legal authority, but the development of the Office des Routes and&#13;
the actual procedures adopted by the other ministries for the procurement of contracts for works, have&#13;
impaired the efficiency of the MTPAT. Considering its specific function in the procurement, a special&#13;
review was conducted with the Department of Civil Buildings. This revealed the extreme weakness of the&#13;
capacity of its staff and equipment. Some works have however been carried out during the last months&#13;
(mortuary of the General Hospital, mausoleum (in progress), rehabilitation works at the airport and at a&#13;
iudicial facility in Matete, maintenance works of power station...). A phased project of institutional&#13;
reinforcing and capacity building is essential before relying on this unit for works of magnitude. This&#13;
Direction also manages a register of contracting and consulting firms: 219 firms are registered on the&#13;
basis of the qualification of their permanent employees, their capacity in equipment and their experience.&#13;
Th.e.re are tWo categories. Ten conmpannie are of nlass A asdpted for thei larger works, and 209 are of class&#13;
B, applicable to small and micro-enterprises. The registration is valid for a 3-year period and are renewed&#13;
at the initiative of the applica-nts. The relihiablitu f the rgisetpir ic questionable as it lacks an nhietiivp ei,an&#13;
rigorous system of classification. The whole MTPAT organization would be an essential beneficiary in a&#13;
p  ct ofr instiutional c    ...lding.&#13;
IAcLtiuu tu be -Implemeuteud&#13;
*  Training of personnel to tne application oI tne Bank's general principles in procurem-ent procedures,&#13;
with a priority for the contracts for services in order to allow for an accelerated technical assistance in&#13;
the functions of design and works supervision.&#13;
* Establishment of a management structure equipped with a Management Information System to&#13;
integrate all components of an efficient and rigorous contract management.&#13;
* Redefining of the dispositions for a system of firms registration appropriate with the requirements of&#13;
qualification criteria as they would be spelled out in the revised bidding documents.&#13;
Sources of information for the review of procurement procedures have also included the Ministry of&#13;
Education and the Ministry of Health, for which, the needs for goods, works and services have to be&#13;
answered through the legal dispositions involving the Tender Board (Conseil des Adjudications). For any&#13;
construction work, these ministries have to collaborate with the relevant Direction of the MTPAT. It was&#13;
confirmed that the sole-source negotiation had become the usual procedure with the systematic&#13;
application of the self granted anoroval to avoid the legal procedure of competitive bidding ("D6claration&#13;
de Non-recours a l'Adjudication Publique". The shortfalls in planning and budgeting stages have been&#13;
mepntinnPd nand noanfirmnpd The interactinns and collahorahion with the MTPAT designated as the&#13;
Government Representative for the works' contract management were considered effective for the limited&#13;
interventions that were uMndertalern dring the last few years, but th.e efficienny w2S said to remain&#13;
questionable because of the limited capacity of the MTPAT.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
2. Dispositions for future projects' implementation&#13;
2.1. Actions for projects with immediate impact&#13;
Considering the broad needs in structural adjustments and the capacity building of the institutions, the&#13;
setting of a temporary project implementation unit must be considered for these types of projects in an&#13;
emergency situation. This unit would have to be granted autonomy in implementing the procurement&#13;
management functions. Its interactions with the existing organizations will be determined in direct&#13;
relation to the nature of the interventions. Ideally, these relations should be governed within the&#13;
firAmewnrk nf rnetciflc and detailed agreements with the relevant Public Enterprises or the Ministries.&#13;
designated as the project beneficiaries.&#13;
As an example, for such an emergency project, the likely components of interventions would be in the&#13;
fields of (l) reJhabilftaftion of     c   a.fast  of. crca! ir...JArtn - .hn, (2) direct assistnce to cnV.er the urgent&#13;
health needs, and (3) the implementation of the first operations in the reinforcement of the institutions.&#13;
Under this scenario, the implementation unit would have to conduct its procurement/contract management&#13;
IWuI,c.AIRIVb ,IU   L1eULZUUUAUIV. WeLP-1K  U aLd seVriVc WIUI U1. t-.e OfLice UV's AVWULtes, .d posOs;.ly 7".&#13;
REGIDESO (water supply network) and SNEL (power distribution). The objective would be to take full&#13;
advantage of the existig technical expertise and counit on their patl icipation, especially during thue p.hases&#13;
of project definition (studies and specifications) and evaluation, during the bids analysis, during the works&#13;
supervision in association with subcontracted consuitant engineering finns, and during tne pnase of&#13;
acceptance of the completed works and supplied spare parts.&#13;
The direct assistance in the improvement of the health situation would imply for the unit to proceed with&#13;
the acquisition of materials, equipment, pharmaceutical products, vaccines, etc... based on specifications&#13;
provided by the services of the Ministry of Health. The services connected with the distribution would be&#13;
covered through entities already operational in the country.&#13;
Relating to the component of the reinforcement of the institutional capacities, the unit will be mainly&#13;
involved in the procurement of contracts for services (training) and the supply and installation of a&#13;
computerized management tool (MIS) with the associated services.&#13;
Under this scenario, a realistic assumption would be to consider the signing of 30 to 40 contracts for&#13;
goods, 5 to 10 contracts for works (mainly through international competitive bidding), 5 to 10 contracts&#13;
for services of studies/design and works supervision, and 10 to 15 contracts for services of technical&#13;
assistance. The relating phase for the Drocurement of 60 to 75 contracts would be within a time frame of&#13;
about 4 months, for a project implementation of 15 to 18 months.&#13;
66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.2. Actions while preparing normal procedures' conditions&#13;
The revision of the legislation and structures related to public procurement, along with the associated&#13;
phases of information and training, would have to be included in the emergency project component of the&#13;
capacity building of the institutions. After an implementation of 12 to 18 months, the conditions should&#13;
be met for a smooth relay of the procurement management functions by the implementation unit to the&#13;
Administration.&#13;
Beyond the, duration of the emergency project, it may be contemplated that the contract management&#13;
expertise of the implementation unit, with its acquired experience, may be useful on a more permanent&#13;
basis. It might for instance become a management organization for small works or specific assistance for&#13;
the benefit of municipalities and rural entities. The management function would especially be valuable for&#13;
projects for which their nature, or their importance, place them outside of the regular field of the sectorial&#13;
ministries, but where the sound procurement and contract management in line with the legislation, are&#13;
nonetheless of the utmost importance.&#13;

2. BCECO. DFA of BCECO presently consists of the Director, an Accountant and one Administration&#13;
Officer. Witn tnC assisUance 01 a rinanciai k-01ISUILWaIL, IL has atUULtU a it riiiuai0l f finaniiwal piut-cuuic&#13;
and established adequate internal procedures for review and financing of sub-projects under the IDA&#13;
Grant and Trust Fund. it has recently acquired and installed an software (Tompro) capable of maintaining&#13;
accounting records of several projects. As part of further reinforcements of DFA, BCECO is already (i)&#13;
recruiting an internai Controller (who will also serve as Advisor to BCECO clients) and (ii) finaiizing a&#13;
contract for continuation of services of the Financial Consultant who has assisted BCECO so far in&#13;
various aspects of its fnancial functions.&#13;
3. As indicated above, operations under EMRRP will require further additions to BCECO staff. This&#13;
reinforcements will be critical for effective implementation of EMRRP operations. Hence, BCECO will&#13;
recruit internationally, (i) a deputy general manager, (ii) a financial management specialist and (iii) a&#13;
procurement specialist as well as (iv) a chief accountant, two accountants, two procurement officers, two&#13;
implementation officers and an internal auditor (to be recruited locally) latest within two months of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
4. A recent mission by a Bank FMS has reviewed with BCECO the requirements of submission of&#13;
quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports in accordance with the recent Bank Guidelines FMRs. BCECO is&#13;
expected to submit the first FMRs (for IDA Grant and TF operations) by May 15, 2002 for the quarter&#13;
ending March 31, 2002. These will be supplemented by FMRs prepared separately, for EMRRP&#13;
operations commencing the end of first full quarter after effectiveness. The FMRs will include (a) a&#13;
statement Sources and Uses of Funds, (b) describe up to date physical progress for project implementation&#13;
nnd (c) indicate status on main procureTntrnt actions.&#13;
5. Wit,h the actions mentoned aboe, the ove.rall finanrcial rmaageme.nt of E MRRP by BCECO should&#13;
be adequate and acceptable to IDA.&#13;
6. External Audits. BCECO has recently commenced the recruitment of external auditors under TORs&#13;
(and SOi[ list o1 auuit fiiijs) acceptable  IJJto  . IL lb LI*Us oH shdleULI fur ULhe LfirL aUUIL (of iV Grant&#13;
and TF operations) as of June 30, 2002. Financial statements of BCECO will be audited every six months&#13;
thereafter and include separate statements for EMvRissR operations once E-IRRP becomes effective. Audit&#13;
reports would be submitted to IDA within four months after the end of each semester. Financial&#13;
statements of PMWT will be audited every six montns after credit effectiveness. Audit reports wouid be&#13;
submitted to IDA within four months after the end of each semester.&#13;
7. Project Management and Implementation Firm (PMIF)._MIF will be responsible for financial&#13;
management of resources for components A, and part of components C and D of EMRRP. Since the&#13;
PMIF has not yet been recruited no work has yet been undertaken to assess adequacy of staff and&#13;

Soonest after its appointment, a Bank FMS will undertake a review in order to ensure that the PMIF has&#13;
adequate financial staff capable of establishing adequate procedures and intemral con.rols over the use of&#13;
project funds. The adoption by MOF of a financial and administrative manual for PMIF, satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, is a condition of disbursement for expenditures managed by PMivi. it will aiso ensure that the PILir&#13;
becomes familiar with the IDA's procurement and disbursements procedures, requirements of adequate&#13;
accounting and submission of quarterly FMKs.&#13;
8. Taxes and Government Contribution. IDA credit will finance 100 percent of: (i) foreign&#13;
expenditures for goods and consultant services; (ii) operating costs. IDA credit will finance 85 percent&#13;
of: (i) works and service contracts; and (ii) local expenditures for goods and consultant services. The&#13;
15% remaining is estimated to be tax component and will be bome by the Government. However since it&#13;
would not be possible for the Govemment to advance funds for this to BCECO and PMLF, the&#13;
Govemment will establish arrangements under which the contractors, NGOs and suppliers of goods and&#13;
services to EMRRP will be allowed a "Cheque du Tresor" for the 15% tax component against their&#13;
invoices. Such arrangements, satisfactory to IDA will be established no later than three months after&#13;
project effectiveness.&#13;
9. Special Account. The project is expected to be completed over a three-year period, and the Credit&#13;
closing date will hbe Iiin- 'AO 2005  Tn facilitate nrmiect implementAtion and reduce the volume of&#13;

and D. The authorized allocation would be US$20 million for Special Account A and US$15 million for&#13;
Special Acco-unt B, and would covei about four m11onthls of eligible expenditures.  Upon credit&#13;
effectiveness, IDA would deposit the amount of US$10 million into Special Account A and US$8 million&#13;
US into Special Account B representing approximately fifty percent of ine authonzed allocations. iLn&#13;
remaining balance would be made available when the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the credit&#13;
account plus the totai amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association&#13;
shall be equal or exceed the equivalent of US$190 million for Special Account A and US$90 million for&#13;
Special Account B. The Special Account would be used for all payments inferior to twenty percent of the&#13;
authorized allocation and replenishment applications would be submitted monthly. Further deposits by&#13;
IDA into the Special Accounts would be made against withdrawal applications supported by appropriate&#13;
documents.&#13;
10. Use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements for all expenditures would be made&#13;
against full documentation, except for items of expenditures for: (a) contracts for works in an amount&#13;
inferior to $250,000; (b) contracts for equipment and goods in an amount inferior to $200,000; (c)&#13;
contracts for consulting firms in an amount inferior to $100,000 and contracts for individual consultants&#13;
in an amount inferior to $50,000 equivalent, as well as all operating costs, which would be claimed on the.&#13;
basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained at&#13;
a suitable location at the PMIF and BCECO and readily accessible for review by periodic IDA&#13;
supervision missions and extemal auditors.&#13;

A. General presentation of the system&#13;
2.     The contracts and projects financed by donors and financing agencies have to be signed and&#13;
executed including ail taxes by the contractors selected. Tne contractual amount excluding is the basis for&#13;
the donor or financing agencies funding. The State takes in charge exclusively the indirect fiscality on the&#13;
contract which in the precise case is the CCA invoiced by the contractor.&#13;
3.     The selected contractor is in the same situation as any of the economic agent. It pays the import&#13;
custom duties when importing of the input for the execution of the contract and pay s to the Treasury the&#13;
taxes and duties to be paid within the framework of the execution of the contract. The only difference is&#13;
that the State will give the contractor a Tracery Check corresponding to the CCA that he invoiced. This&#13;
Treasury Check will be used by the contractor to pay the taxes at the Taxes Department of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance.&#13;
B. Practical modalities to manage the System. Modalit6s pratiques de gestion du dispositif&#13;

6.     The future contractors will indicate in their bidding financial proposals the amount without taxes,&#13;
the amount of taxes and duties they estimate as well as the amount all taxes and duties included2. On&#13;
these basis and once the commission has controlled, the commission has to evaluate the amounts of&#13;
Treasury Checks to be involved in order to prepare the Budget.&#13;
E. Presentation of the Treasury Check.&#13;
7.     The Treasury check is established when the contractor is paid, based on the final invoices or on&#13;
the provisional requests for payment or intermediate advance payments.&#13;

G. Monitoring of the use of the Treasury Checks.&#13;
9.     Monitoring the use of the Treasury Checks is the responsibility of the commission already&#13;
mentioned. Tne commission will do so through a special software which will allow to take into account&#13;
each operation by contractor, to follow which goods and services were involved; and the basis and&#13;
amounts of the taxes considered. This will allow the establishment of the statistical data to estimate the&#13;
budgetary cost of such a system.&#13;
H. Revision of the Treasury check entitled within the contract.&#13;
10.    The amount of the Treasury check established could be reviewed if the general conditions of the&#13;
contract execution or the fiscal law are modified. In such a case there will be a need a contract&#13;
amendment (cases of price changes, partial execution of the contract, are examples).&#13;
11.   In case a control reveals mistakes or frauds, the T'reasury checks established can be void. In such&#13;
a case the amounts already paid would have to be reimbursed. Penalties and fiscal or custom sanctions&#13;
would eventually be applied.&#13;

APPENDIX 15.        Environmental and Social Management Aspects&#13;
Environmental and Social Conditions: The DRC has immense natural resources. The Congo Basin is&#13;
a resource of international significance, with many species found nowhere on earth. it is the second&#13;
largest continuous tropical forest in the world. Its forestry resources cover 170 million hectares, about 74&#13;
percent of the surface area of the DRC, and nearly half of Africa's tropical forests. Protected areas cover&#13;
six percent of the forest. There are three world heritage sites in the DRC. The Urban environment has&#13;
suffered from a breakdown of infrastructure. About 74 percent of the burden of disease derives from poor&#13;
public health conditions and lack of sanitation in the cities. Insecurity in the rural areas because of armed&#13;
conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands of people.&#13;
Capacity of the Government to Manage Environmental and Social Issues in Projects: Capacity of&#13;
Government to manage the potential enviromnental impacts of development projects is limited, due in&#13;
part to the absence of donor support during the last ten years. The Government has produced a National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan in 1997, which identifies major issues, describes institutional arrangements&#13;
for managing g environmental matters and lays out a strategy for institutional strengthening. A national&#13;
environmental agency was created and a national environmental fund established. The Government has&#13;
requested assistance in a number of areas, including reforming and updating environmental legislation,&#13;
formulating environmental guidelines and clarification and strengthening of roles among the Ministry of&#13;
Land Tenure, Enviromnent and Tourism and other sectoral ministries for environmental management.&#13;
Project Category: Although the project is focused on rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, the scale&#13;
and natu re of the project act-t nes, as well as the potential for resettlement, displacement and social&#13;
tensions within the currently unstable political situation, require that it be classified as a Category A&#13;
prject. The p.oject is ar em.ergency --ecover; op n pcessed ur OPf'D 0.5C0 A g-11  e&#13;

Applicability of other Safeguard Policies: The applicability of the remaining 9 Safeguard Policies still&#13;
needs to be determined (TBD). In all likelihood OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) will be triggered, as&#13;
some land acquisition might be required. The applicability of the other Safeguard Policies will be&#13;
determined during preparation of the Environmental and Social Management Process Framework EA&#13;
(ESMPF) and the subproject EAs.&#13;
Approach to the Environmental and Social Safeguard Management Process: Because the project is&#13;
rnulti-sertoral in natire, and not all the Qiip.rA i,.etc. a rre,,, at t1n.s tire, a prga...'.&#13;
process for environmental and social assessment (including screening and categorization), review,&#13;

Because local capacity for environmental and social management is currently weak, an Environmental&#13;
Consulting Firm will be engaged for a period of three years to manage and oversee the Environmental and&#13;
Social Management Process, while providing institutional strengthening and on-the-job training services&#13;
throughout the project period. T his firm will work closely with the PMU, the Bank and the implementing&#13;
agencies to develop procedures that will improve subproject quality and sustainability through&#13;
compliance with Safeguards, while at the same time, being time and cost-efficient, so as to facilitate&#13;
subproject planning, approval and implementation.&#13;
72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The establishment of this nrocess will be implemented in three hroad time-nhased activities (as shown in&#13;

ESMPF by the borrower and the Bank; (vii) disclosure of the ESMPF in country and in the Infoshop in&#13;
Washington. The standard procedures will take account of the particular characteristics of each of the&#13;
sectors involved, and will be embodied in an Operations Manual. The basic principles and processes&#13;
enunciated in the Operational Manual will also be summarized in an Environmental and Social&#13;
Framework Agreement, in which the DRC and the Bank agree to basic environmental and social&#13;
safeguard principles and procedures, and the DRC affirms its agreement to carry out all subproject&#13;
activities in accordance with these procedures. The requirement for the correct implementation of the&#13;
ESMPF will be covenanted in the DCA.&#13;
The Environmental Consulting Firm will work closely with the PMU and local stakeholders to draft the&#13;
Framework Agreement. During the preparation of the Framework, the firm will also work closely with&#13;
the PMU to develop a preliminary calendar for annual subproject screening and categorization,&#13;
assessments, implementation and monitoring, based on an initial estimate of subproject flow.&#13;
Activity 2: Ongoing Subproiect Assessment and ImDlementation. This activitv includes the carrying&#13;
out of subproject EAs, which will be carried out under the umbrella of the ESMPF. Once the Operational&#13;
Mannil and Fr_mewnorl Agreernent 2re put in nlace, the nrvironrmental Consulting Firm wuill wnrk hand-&#13;

Activity 3: Institutional Capacity Building. An important aspect of the Environmental and Social&#13;
Management Process will involve institutionalization of the procedures laid out in the Operational&#13;
Manual and Framework Agreements, and building local capacity to carry them out. To this end, the&#13;
Environmental Consulting Firm will work closely with the PMU and implementing agencies to propose&#13;
appropriate and efficient institutional arrangements for sustainable management of environmental and&#13;
social issues. In support of these efforts, and in conjunction with the program of consultations and&#13;
participation, the firm will provide on-the-job training and conduct in-country workshops for staff in the&#13;
PMU, implementing sector agencies, local communities, etc.&#13;

To this end, the Consulting Firm will assist the Government, through a series of public consultations and&#13;
meetings, to verify tne scope of issues to be addressed with respect to the ESPVIrF and each&#13;
subcomponent, and obtain the views of implementing agencies, local communities, NGOs and affected&#13;
groups. Tn ese scoping sessions should occur in Kinshasa and selected regionai locations, so as to obtain&#13;
a representative sample of points of view throughout the country. The Environmental and Social&#13;
Assessment Process Framework Report and the subproject EAs will include an Appendix providing a&#13;
record of these meetings, with a list of participants and the proposals and requests for information made in&#13;
the course of the meetings. This would include comments from Government agencies, affected parties&#13;
and national/local non-governmental organizations. For the ESMPF and subproject Category A projects a&#13;
public consultation will be held on the TOR and on the Draft ESMPF report. For the subprojects Category&#13;

Major issues: As noted, the overall environmental and social issues associated with each sector will be&#13;
identified during the development of the Environmental and Social Management Framework. These will&#13;
be divided into potential effects during the initial siting/design/construction period and during the&#13;
operational period of each type of investment. Below is a preliminary identification of potential issues.&#13;
Component A: Rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical infrastructure.&#13;
Transport infrastructure: Similar to the rural roads and access tracks, larger transport improvements are&#13;
expected on existing alignments, with minimal chance for resettlement. However, this will be verified on&#13;
a case-by-case basis during the initial screening process. During the construction phase, direct impacts&#13;
should be considered, such as borrow sites, disposal sites, accelerated erosion, degradation of the natural&#13;
vegetation, temporary noise, dust and pollution levels from construction machinery, and social impacts,&#13;
such as increased risk of HIV/AIDS and other sexuallv transmitted diseases at construction camns. Other&#13;
social issues could concem the presence of refugees or squatters in areas affected by the subproject.&#13;
During the maintenance/onerations nhase notential imnacts mav includ(e increamed accidlent levels duie to&#13;
higher speeds and potential impacts of traffic on sensitive biological systems or protected areas, increased&#13;
poaching of hiihmeat and incrreased logging of tmopica hardwood.&#13;
Electricit,y serices: Potential issues include the siting of pox,ver generation and distribution facilities,&#13;
proximity to populated areas and safety considerations. Rehabilitation might produce hazardous&#13;

take and loss of agricultural land in the right of way of distribution lines, and potential presence of&#13;
refugees or squatters in tne sub'project areas. Otiher potential social impacis such as ine increased riSK of&#13;
HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases at construction sites should be considered where&#13;
applicabie. Disposal of potential waste material should be addressed during the construction and&#13;
operational phases. Positive impacts of rural electrification may include facilitation of a wide range of&#13;
development endeavors, including evening light for c-hildren reading, refrigeration for medicines and&#13;
power for agro-processing and small enterprises. Negative impacts of rural electrification might be the&#13;
increase in malaria prevalence, if no adequate mitigation measures are taken (environmental health&#13;
issues).&#13;
Water supply, sanitation and urban infrastructure: Potential issues include the siting of water supplies&#13;
and sanitation facilities in relation to populated areas, need for drainage and avoidance of stagnant water&#13;
and water-bome diseases (environmental health issues). Solid waste programs need to adequately plan&#13;
for appropriate siting and protection of disposal areas. Social impacts, such as potential displacement&#13;
resulting from urban infrastructure from construction sites, as well as the potential for interface with&#13;
76&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
refugees or squatters, should be considered where applicable; Health and sanitation aspects of improved&#13;
water supplies constitute a potential benefit which should be exnlicitlv addressed in the design of the&#13;
interventions.&#13;
In all cases, social benefits include employment during the construction and operations phases, and&#13;
improved accev.- tn hbaic s-rvices.&#13;

to be carried out on existing alignments and first focus on spot improvements, the potential for major&#13;
Im.pacts rel^ated to land use, hydrology and resettlemenlRt are considered rminimal. Duunng the construction&#13;
phase, direct impacts need to be considered, such as borrow sites, disposal sites, accelerated erosion,&#13;
degradation of the natural vegetation and sociai impacts of construction camps, inciuding tne risk of&#13;
HIV/AIDS. Other social issues may involve the existence of refugees and squatters on agricultural land&#13;
being developed by the subproject, which would trigger OP 4.12 (involuntary Resettlement). During the&#13;
maintenance/operations phase, potential impacts may include increased accident levels due to higher&#13;
speeds and potentiai impacts of traffic on sensitive biological systems or protected areas, increased&#13;
poaching of bushmeat and increased logging of tropical hardwood. Social benefits include employment&#13;
during the construction and operations phases.&#13;
Support to producer organizations: Potential impacts may include the procurement, use and proper&#13;
storage of pesticides, fertilizers and other chemicals to support production activities, although at this time&#13;
this is considered to be minimal. Programs and policies to support production activities should address&#13;
issues of sustainability, for example soil conservation and cultivation on steep slopes.&#13;
Health support programs: Siting of health care facilities should take into consideration proximity to&#13;
populated areas, drainage considerations and sanitary facilities. Support should be given to facilities and&#13;
educational programs aimed at reducing HIV/AIDS infection. Utilization and disposal of medical waste&#13;
should be explicitly planned for during the operational period. Handling, and disposal of medical wastes&#13;
(hosnital wastes) need a snecial environmental managemernt plan.&#13;

Tne overall purpose of ine proposed Emergency Multi-Sector Renabilitation and Reconstruction Project&#13;
(EMRRP) is to initiate the long-term process of reconstruction and economic rehabilitation. Neglect,&#13;
mismanagement, and damage from the war have led to the near coliapse of the DRC's infrastructure and&#13;
capacity of government to deliver basic services or carry out govemment functions. The specific&#13;
objectives of the project are to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to (a) start rebuilding&#13;
agricultural production and enhance food security, (b) reconstruct and rehabilitate critical infrastructure,&#13;
(c) restore essential social services and build community infrastructure, and (d) strengthen capacity of&#13;
govenmment to formulate, implement, and manage medium and long-term development programs.&#13;
The proposed program will be among the first to be implemented as the DRC emerges from a long period&#13;
of instability and economic decline towards a period of recovery. The program will be countrywide, with&#13;
activities restricted only where the local security situation would make supervising the activities difficult.&#13;
To compensate for weak government capacity, it will be prepared and implemented within the framework&#13;
of a single operation to facilitate implementation and supervision.&#13;
The proposed program will have four components, summarized as follows:&#13;
ComDonent A: Rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical infrastructure. This component will&#13;
finance the rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical transportation infrastructure, electricity services,&#13;
water sunnlies; and urban infrastructure- It compnrises five sbcornmponents: transportation, roads,&#13;
electricity, water supply, and urban services and infrastructure.&#13;
Component B: Agriculture, Social Services and community development. The agriculture&#13;

development projects. Improving and expanding health care services is the priority among the subsectors&#13;
because of the extraordinary extent to wnich disease is damaging the productivity and weii-being of the&#13;
people of the country.&#13;
Component C: Development of the medium and long term sector development strategies, capacity&#13;
building and institutional reform. 'T'his component will finance the preparation of the development&#13;
strategies for the DRC's most important sectors: agriculture, education, health, transportation (covering&#13;
all modes), water and sanitation, electricity, and social protection. It will also cover costs of&#13;
implementing sector and institutional reforms and of building human and institutional capacity. Finally,&#13;
this component will finance the principal studies and preparatory activities for future investment&#13;
programs.&#13;
Component D: Management, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the brogram and&#13;
the IDA-financed project. This component will finance project management, and monitoring and&#13;
78&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
evaluation of the implementation of the program and IDA-financed project. This will involve technical&#13;
assistance. exnertise, consiiltant services, lnisrtical sunport and equipment.&#13;
The prog.ram. will be sunpport.ed through a mrulti-donor effort. The. on,Zrpll cost of the progrm is estimated&#13;
to be about $ 1.755 billion, with IDA financing estimated to be about $ 576 million, or 33 percent of the&#13;

agencies involved in the program. It will be implemented through two major subprograms:&#13;
Subprogram A: Rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure. Given the technical nature and&#13;
scope of worics, this subprogram will be executed by an intemationai management and impiementation&#13;
firm that specializes in managing execution of large infrastructure projects. The firm will be fully&#13;
responsible for preparing tenders, carrying out evaluations, and supervising contracts on behalf of the&#13;
government, in accordance with Bank procurement, financial management and disbursement guidelines.&#13;
Subprogram B: Agriculture and social services and community development. The Bureau Central de&#13;
Coordination (BCECO), which has recently been established under the Ministry of Finance to administer&#13;
donor-financed projects (and which is executing the IDA grant), will execute this component. It will set&#13;
up a unit (a division) within the organization to follow up on the subprogram, reinforced by intemational&#13;
procurement and financial management specialists. The unit will be responsible for managing contracts,&#13;
procurement, and financial matters of the subprogram.&#13;
The Government wishes to recruit the services of an internationally-qualified Environmental Consulting&#13;
Firm who will work with the Government to ensure that the above program is carried out in an&#13;
environmentally and socially sound manner, and that the IDA funded investments and activities comply&#13;
with the World Bank Safeguard Policies (listed in Attachment 1).&#13;

The UoveI-all UUJecLive of UtllS assiginruieuut iS LU er nsure tat all investments aniactivi-is financed oy iu A&#13;
under the EMRRP fully comply with the World Bank's Safeguard Policies. Because the project is multi-&#13;
sectorai in nature, and not all the subproject investments are kcnown at this time, a programmatic process&#13;
for environmental and social assessment (including screening and categorization), review, approval and&#13;
monitoring will be put in place and implemented over the three year life of the project. Given&#13;
uncertainties regarding the location of many subprojects, and the complexity of DRC's environmental and&#13;
social situation, this approach is designed to ensure that the selection, design and implementation of all&#13;
subprojects comply with World Bankc Safeguard Policies.&#13;
Because local capacity for environmental and social management is currently weak, an Environmental&#13;
Consulting Firm will be engaged to manage and oversee the Environmental and Social Management&#13;
Process, while providing institutional strengthening and on-the-job training services throughout the&#13;
project period. This firm will work closely with the PMU, the Bank and the implementing agencies to&#13;
develop procedures that will improve subproject quality and sustainability through compliance with&#13;
Safeguards. This will be done in such a way as to facilitate time- and cost-efficient subproject planning,&#13;
approval and implementation procedures.&#13;

to support the environmental and social management activities at each stage in the subproject cycle. The&#13;
standard procedures will take account ot the particular characteristics ot each of the sectors involved, and&#13;
will be embodied in an Operations Manual. The basic principles and processes enunciated in the&#13;
Operational Manual will also be summarized in an Environmental and Social Framework Agreement, in&#13;
which the DRC and the Bank agree to basic environmental and social safeguard principles and&#13;
procedures, and the DRC affirms its agreement to carry out all subproject activities in accordance with&#13;
these procedures.&#13;
The Environmental Consulting Firm will work closely with the PMU and local stakeholders to carry out&#13;
the above tasks. During the preparation of the Framework, the firm will also work closely with the PMU&#13;
to develop a preliminary calendar for annual subproject screening and categorization, assessments,&#13;
implementation and monitoring, based on an initial estimate of subproject flow.&#13;
Activity 2: Ongoing Subproject Assessment and Implementation. Once the Operational Manual and&#13;
Framework Agreement are in Dlace. the Environmental Consulting Firm will work hand-in-hand with&#13;
local counterparts to plan and carry out the overall Environmental and Social Management Process for the&#13;

Activity 1: Environmental and Social Assessment Process Framework&#13;
Goal: In this first phase, the Environmental Consulting Firm will carrv out a broad assessment of the&#13;
environmental and social issues associated with each sub-component of the project and develop a set of&#13;
operational tools and procedures for systematically considering these issues in the nlanning and&#13;
implementation of the subprojects. The proposed operational tools will be applied for the screening,&#13;

Task 1.1: Verification of Proposed Project&#13;
The Consultant will verify the content, scope and phasing of the IDA project and the broader program.&#13;
his -will be based on the project documents, complemented by field discussions with project staff and&#13;
additional information gathered by the Consultant. The Consultant will collaborate with the Project&#13;
Management Unit to develop a simpie database iisting of ali types of subprojects, categorized by&#13;
subprogram, component, sectoral subcomponent and subproject. The Environmental Consultant will also&#13;
design an implementing framework for incorporating environmental and social management into the&#13;
subproject lifecycle for each of each subprogram and subcomponent.&#13;
Task 1.2: Environmental Scoping and Consultation and Subproject Scoping Methodology&#13;
The scoping and consultation process will be a means though which the Government will reinforce its&#13;
commitment to environmental and social management and build public confidence in the anticipated&#13;
program design and implementation. To this end, the Consultant will assist the Govemment, through a&#13;
series of consultations and meetings, to verify the scope of issues to be addressed with respect to each&#13;
subcomponent, and obtain the views of implementing agencies, local communities, NGOs and affected&#13;
groups. These scoping sessions should occur in Kinshasa and selected regional locations, so as to obtain&#13;
a representative sample of points of view throughout the country. The Environmental and Social&#13;
Management Framework Report will include an Appendix providing a record of these meetings, with a&#13;
list of Darticipants and the DroDosals and requests for information made in the course of the meetings.&#13;
This would include comments from Government agencies, affected parties and national/local non-&#13;
governmental organizations.&#13;

assess the institutional responsibilities and capabilities for environmentai protection and management m&#13;
the DRC, as well as within the project's implementing agencies. Based on this assessment, the&#13;
Consultant should reconmmend: (i) a project institutional framework that will facilitate the elficient&#13;
incorporation of environmental and social considerations into the subproject planning and implementation&#13;
processes; (ii) medium and long term institutional strengthening to ensure that environmental protection is&#13;
integrated into sector management. These recommendations should be embodied in the Environmental&#13;
and Social Framework Agreements (as described in Task 1.9).&#13;

Consulting Firm will address the need to characterize baseline environmental and social conditions at two&#13;
levels:&#13;
1.4.1 Overview of national baseline conditions. This will include a broad description of the national&#13;
environmental situation, focusing on major regions, ecosystems, protected areas, special concerns and&#13;
social issues, as they are likely to relate to the various categories of subprojects. The following general&#13;
categories of conditions should, at a minimum, be addressed:&#13;
* Land resources&#13;
* Hydrology&#13;
*  Water quality&#13;
* Biological (biodiversity, including forests)&#13;
*  Air q,i-alitu,&#13;

that could arise in particular regions or zones. This would follow the same general categories as shown&#13;
above, and could be presented in tabular/checklist format, with short explanations of the types and data&#13;
and other infornation to be collected (as well as references to data sources as noted in the Overview of&#13;
National Baseline Conditions).&#13;
Task 1.5: Methodology for Determining Potential Project Impacts&#13;
For each of the major categories of sectors and subprojects, the Consultant will identify and assess the&#13;
major potential environmental and social issues likely to occur, with respect to each of the general&#13;
categories mentioned in the baseline conditions. These impacts should be assessed as they are expected&#13;
to occur during the siting/design/construction period and the operational period. Also to be considered are&#13;
potential cumulative effects within the sectors, both direct and indirect. Of particular concern will be how&#13;
to address the social dimensions of the subprojects, as they relate to refugees, squatters and displaced&#13;
persons. For the program as a whole, the significance of potential impacts should be assessed in terms of&#13;

development of the Environmental and Social Management Process Framework. These will be divided&#13;
into potential efIects uring the initial sitingu'desigvuounsLrutLlUl priIUU nUU uring the opera-ional periuoU&#13;
of each type of investment. Below is a preliminary identification of potential issues.&#13;
Component A: Rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical infrastructure.&#13;
1Transport infrastructure: Similar to the rural roads and access tracks, iarger transport improvements are&#13;
expected on existing alignments, with minimal chance for resettlement. However, this will be verified on&#13;
a case-by-case basis during the initial screening process. During the construction phase, direct impacts&#13;
should be considered, such as borrow sites, disposal sites, accelerated erosion, degradation of the natural&#13;
vegetation, temporary noise, dust and pollution levels from construction machinery, and social impacts,&#13;
such as increased risk of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases at construction camps. Other&#13;
social issues could concem the presence of refugees or squatters in areas affected by the subproject.&#13;
During the maintenance/operations phase, potential impacts may include increased accident levels due to&#13;
higher speeds and potential impacts of traffic on sensitive biological systems or protected areas.&#13;
Electricity services: Potential issues include the siting of power generation and distribution facilities,&#13;
proximity to populated areas and safety considerations. In the case of hydropower, impacts on&#13;
surrounding flora and fauna, and potential for land acquisition should be taken into consideration during&#13;
the siting, design and operational phases. Social issues of particular relevance would include potential&#13;
land take and loss of agricultural land in the right of way of distribution lines, and potential presence of&#13;
refuilees or squatters in the subproiect areas. Other social imnacts such as the increased risk of HIV/AIDS&#13;
and other sexually transmitted diseases at construction sites should be considered where applicable.&#13;

infrastructure from construction sites, as well as the potential for interface with refugees or squatters,&#13;
snould be considered where applicable. Health and sanitation aspects oI improved water supplies&#13;
constitute a potential benefit which should be explicitly addressed in the design of the interventions.&#13;
In all cases, social benefits include employment during the construction and operations phases, and&#13;
improved access to basic services.&#13;
Component B: Agriculture, Social Services and community development.&#13;
Agriculture.&#13;
Rehabilitation of rural roads and access tracks: Since all road improvements are expected to be carried&#13;
out on existing alignments and first focus on spot improvements, the potential for major impacts related to&#13;
land use, hydrology and resettlement are considered minimal. During the construction phase, direct&#13;
impacts need to be considered, such as borrow sites, disposal sites, accelerated erosion, degradation of the&#13;
natural vegetation and social impacts of construction camps, including the risk of HIV/AIDS. Other&#13;
social issues may involve the existence of refugees and squatters on agricultural land being developed by&#13;
the subproject Dnuring the maintenance/nperations phase, potential impacts may include increased&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The purpose of the Emergency Multisector
            Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, is to initiate
            the long-term process of reconstruction, and economic
            rehabilitation. The project comprises four components: 1)
            rehabilitation, and reconstruction of critical
            infrastructure - transport, water supply, electricity, and
            urban infrastructure; 2) agricultural development, delivery
            of social services - education, health care, and social
            protection - and, community development; 3) development of
            sector strategies for the medium, and long term, and,
            strengthening of human, and institutional capacities; and,
            4) management, monitoring and evaluation of project
            implementation. The project will help prevent the further
            deterioration of health, and loss of peoples lives, by
            increasing food security, delivering health care, and other
            basic services, restoring water, and energy supply services,
            and will lay the foundation for future policy, and
            institutional reforms. These benefits will far outweigh the
            risks of failure within the peace process, or the potential
            for conflict resumption.
