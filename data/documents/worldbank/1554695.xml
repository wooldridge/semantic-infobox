FOREWORD&#13;
Centrally planned economies (CPEs) account for a significant share of&#13;
the world's production and income.    In view of their importance in the world&#13;
economy, and to facilitate international comparative analysis, for many years&#13;
the World Bank has included statistical data on these countries in those of&#13;
its publications that aim for universal coverage, such as The World Bank&#13;
Atlas.   Among these data, those relating to gross national product (GNP) and&#13;
to GNP per capita are the most important, and the Bank also needs them for&#13;
operational purposes for its member countries, which now include some CPEs.&#13;
In the CPEs prices are generally set administratively and are often&#13;
loosely or not at all related to the relative scarcity and costs of production&#13;
of goods and services.    This is particularly true of the exchange rate.    The&#13;
World Bank normally uses exchange rates for converting GNP figures from&#13;
national   currencies   into  dollars   (or  into   any  other  numeraire),   an&#13;
indispensable   step  for   international  comparisons.     The  choice   of  an&#13;
appropriate conversion factor therefore poses particularly difficult problems&#13;
for most CPEs.   A further difficulty arises because the national accounts of&#13;
the CPEs are based on the concept of net material product (NMP), which differs&#13;
from the concept of GNP used in market economies.     To derive the GNP numbers&#13;
of those CPEs that compile only NMP accounts, various adjustments must be&#13;
made.   The data required for making these adjustments are not always fully&#13;
available.   Finally, a separate set of issues arises in relation to year to&#13;
year comparisons within the same CPE.      For these too and the corresponding&#13;
growth rates, official data are not strictly comparable to growth rates of the&#13;
market economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In early 1982 a research project sponsored and financed by the World&#13;
Bank was undertaken to assess alternative methods of computing the per capita&#13;
dollar GNP levels and growth rates of CPEs.        It covered eight countries:&#13;
Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary,&#13;
Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R.    The purpose of this research project was to&#13;
define the best among known methods that could be applied to CPEs as a group&#13;
and make use of available data.     It was not its aim to establish and define&#13;
new computation methods whose application would have required many more years&#13;
of effort, even if data had been available.&#13;
-    This  research   project  has  produced   eleven  reports,  which   are&#13;
published   simultaneously.    The  main   report  authored   by  the  principal&#13;
researcher for the project, Paul Marer, is published as a book, Dollar GNPs of&#13;
the USSR and Eastern Europe (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985). The eight&#13;
country studies and two background papers are published separately in the&#13;
World  Bank Staff Working Paper series.       The main report provides highly&#13;
valuable insights into the problems related to the estimation and comparison&#13;
of the GNPs and GNP growth rates of the CPEs. It also gives the author's best&#13;
estimates of the actual values of these indicators for the majority of CPEs&#13;
covered by the project, that is those for which there was some statistical&#13;
basis for computing estimates or choosing between those already available.&#13;
The main report on the Research Project on CPEs concludes that&#13;
adequate GNP data in national currencies can be derived for most CPEs by&#13;
adjusting official information about net material product in the light of&#13;
statistical and other information known to country experts.          It further&#13;
concludes that the best method generally applicable to CPEs for coriverting&#13;
such GNP data from local currencies into dollars would use conversion rates&#13;
based upon purchasing power parity (PPP) information.       For comparison with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
corresponding World Bank data on other World Bank members, these conversion&#13;
rates should be adjusted to correct for the expected differences between the&#13;
PPP rates and the actual official exchange rates (the "exchange rate deviation&#13;
index"). The needed adjustments are estimated econometrically from the actual&#13;
differences observed at each level of per capita GNP among the thirty-one&#13;
market economies participating in Phase III (1975) of the International&#13;
Comparison Project (ICP).    For Hungary, Romania, and Poland, PPP information&#13;
is derived from Phase III (1975) of the ICP, while for Czechoslovakia, the&#13;
German Democratic Republic, and the U.S.S.R., it is derived from private&#13;
bilateral comparisons chain-linked to the ICP data.       This method yields a&#13;
range of per capita GNP estimates: for example, $2,700 to $5,700 with a&#13;
midpoint of $4,190, for the U.S.S.R. in 1980.    No PPP estimate was available,&#13;
and no GNP per capita figure in US dollars calculated, for Bulgaria and Cuba.&#13;
The main report also concludes that the official estimates of growth&#13;
rates of the CPEs "tend to yield varying degrees of upward bias."        For all&#13;
countries except Hungary, the experts lean toward preferring alternative&#13;
indices, constructed by outside experts with partial information, although&#13;
these too present problems (especially for countries other than the U.S.S.R.)&#13;
and the experts therefore fell short of endorsing them.       The author of the&#13;
study on Hungary leans toward preferring the official index at this time.&#13;
The country studies and background papers that are being issued in&#13;
the World Bank Staff Working Paper series provide additional details on the&#13;
CPEs studied and their exchange rates.     Some of the country studies include&#13;
the respective authors' estimates of per capita GNP in U.S. dollars.       These&#13;
estimates, however, are the individual authors' experimental computations,&#13;
based on methods that may not be consistently applicable to CPEs generally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There remain major uncertainties about GNP conversions by means of&#13;
"adjusted PPPs."   In addition to numerous remaining theoretical and practical&#13;
problems associated with calculating PPPs within the framework of the&#13;
centrally coordinated ICP, private estimates such as those used in this study&#13;
for three CPEs still appear to be subject to a wide margin of error.&#13;
Furthermore, there is no other way to estimate the exchange rate deviation&#13;
index than to derive it from observation of the countries covered by the ICP&#13;
(almost all of which are market economies).      The applicability of an index&#13;
derived in this fashion to the CPEs, whose economic structures are very&#13;
different, remains subject to reservations.&#13;
The present study used ICP Phase III data relating to the year 1975,&#13;
extrapolated to 1980.    Phase IV ICP data already published shows estimates&#13;
directly relating to 1980 for European countries, including Hungary and&#13;
Poland; Romania,   a participant in early phases of the ICP, has not provided&#13;
the data needed for participation in Phase IV. It is noteworthy that Phase IV&#13;
estimates of Hungary's and Poland's per capita GNP in 1980 are lower than the&#13;
1975 results extrapolated to 1980, used by the Research Report on CPEs. These&#13;
differences are partly due to the greater attention paid in Phase IV to&#13;
quality differences and to other methodological advances.&#13;
During the course of 1983 the Bank, with the help of a distinguished&#13;
panel of experts, 1/ undertook a review of the methodological problems and&#13;
issues related to the estimation of internationally comparable per capita GNP&#13;
figures for all countries. The preliminary results of the research project on&#13;
CPEs constituted an important input into that review, whose findings and&#13;
1/ Abram Bergson, Harvard University, Chairman; Andre Vanoli, Institut&#13;
National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques; and Parmeet Singh,&#13;
Commonwealth Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
recommendations were approved by the panel of experts.         In light of the&#13;
review, the Bank has decided that for the time being (that is, at least until&#13;
data availability and other problems related to PPP information are resolved),&#13;
official GNP information converted at official exchange rates should generally&#13;
continue to provide the basis of the per capita GNP estimates published in The&#13;
World Bank Atlas.   Exceptions to this rule are to be made only when official&#13;
GNP data, in national currency, is exceptionally bad or compiled in ways which&#13;
diverge in an exceptionally large measure from the usual methods and&#13;
standards, or when the official exchange rate is exceptionally far removed&#13;
from the rate effectively governing foreign payments transactions. When there&#13;
is a reason to believe that such exceptional circumstances prevail, and&#13;
adequate information exists, appropriate adjustments are to be made.        When&#13;
adequate information does not exist and cannot be obtained, no estimates are&#13;
to be published.   At the time of writing this foreword, it seems likely that&#13;
lack of information will for some time prevent the Bank from making estimates&#13;
of the per capita GNP of most CPEs.     Thus The World Bank Atlas published in&#13;
early 1985 contains an estimate of the values of GNP and GNP per capita for&#13;
only one European CPE, fungary.&#13;
Following the review endorsed by the panel of experts, the World Bank&#13;
has adopted calculation methods and obtained results which, for a few&#13;
countries, are different from those of the research project of CPEs.         The&#13;
Bank's general methodology must be applicable to all its member countries,&#13;
including most market economies and only a few CPEs; the Bank could demand&#13;
that its member countries provide additional information when needed; and it&#13;
could, and did, decide not to estimate the per capita GNP of countries for&#13;
which a minimal, but still fairly extensive set of information could not be&#13;
obtained.   As noted earlier, however, the research project on CPEs has aimed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
at defining a method consistently applicable to all CPEs and one that could&#13;
make use of available information.    These differences in aims and constraints&#13;
readily explain the differences in results.&#13;
The research project on CPEs, whose major findings are published in&#13;
the main report, has greatly enhanced the understanding of the CPEs' unique&#13;
macroeconomic accounting frameworks and pricing systems.       It has provided&#13;
insight into many substantive issues, in particular the relationship of&#13;
domestic and international prices.   The individual country reports, published&#13;
separately, shed much light on many important country-specific issues.      The&#13;
Bank will continue to build upon the valuable findings of the research project&#13;
on CPEs in its future efforts to understand these important components of the&#13;
global economy.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
The purpose of the paper is to explain the policy goals underlying the&#13;
multiple exchange rate regime of centrally planned economies (CPEs), to&#13;
clarify the origin and application of the various exchange rates that have&#13;
been in use in seven of the European CPEs, to set up time series of the most&#13;
important ones, and to evaluate whether any of these official rates could be&#13;
used to translate official macroeconomic aggregates of these countries into&#13;
U.S.  dollars.   Because the multiple   exchange   regimes  for the transferable&#13;
ruble and convertible currency trade areas of these countries differ markedly,&#13;
the paper discusses separately the origin, application, significance, and&#13;
variety of exchange rates used in each type of transaction.     It concludes that&#13;
none of the rates can be applied for a direct conversion of macroeconomic&#13;
magnitudes in domestic currency into U.S. dollars. However, some of the rates&#13;
could be applied to various components of the macroeconomic magnitudes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Summary&#13;
Two of the key factors that determine the role of the exchange rate and&#13;
foreign exchange policies in a centrally planned economy (CPE) are the&#13;
prevalence   of   far-reaching   administrative   controls  over   all   economic&#13;
transactions and the great degree of autonomy over the formation of domestic&#13;
prices sought by planners.   Especially important with regard to the latter are&#13;
the dichotomies between consumer and producer prices in the domestic market,&#13;
between prices in trade with market economies and those used in the reciprocal&#13;
trade of the CPEs, and between any set of domestic prices and any set of&#13;
foreign trade prices.    To the extent that strict central planning is being&#13;
successfully pursued, there is no need for an active exchange rate policy or&#13;
for an equilibrium exchange rate.   As a rule, the declared exchange rate is a&#13;
purely passive policy instrument.    It plays no ro ; in the determination of&#13;
the volume and commodity composition of trade, and has only a restricted role&#13;
in the selection of the geographical pattern of predetermined tradables.&#13;
However, even a traditional CPE cannot control each and every type of&#13;
foreign transaction.    Among  those that are very difficult to control are&#13;
tourism, expenditure by trade and diplomatic delegations, private remittances&#13;
and   royalties.   These   transactions   are   usually   executed  without   the&#13;
intermediation of state authorities. In order to regulate them de facto, some&#13;
positive policy to relate domestic and foreign trade prices is required.&#13;
Since the policy makers of traditional CPEs initially discourage tourism and&#13;
trade and diplomatic delegations as much as possible, at least in the early&#13;
postwar periodj they do not condone direct foreign investment; and resort to&#13;
capital flows only in highly exceptional cases, and then only in the form of&#13;
tied real loans,   there is no need to formulate a highly articulated foreign&#13;
exchange policy and to set appropriate rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
When CPEs recognize that attempts to control foreign transactions as much&#13;
as possible may be counterproductive, especially if the policy makers are bent&#13;
on taking advantage in decision-making of the knowledge available only to the&#13;
lower tiers of the planning hierarchy, the role and magnitude of the exchange&#13;
rate need   to be   reexamined.   Similarly,   even  before  decentralization  in&#13;
decision-making is allowed, the authorities may wish to promote some types of&#13;
foreign transactions (especially remittances and tourism) more actively and&#13;
there will therefore emerge a need to regulate such transactions in part with&#13;
the aid of functioning exchange rates.&#13;
In order to set realistic exchange rates that may give the "right"&#13;
signals to decision makers, it is as a rule necessary to revise consumer and&#13;
producer price policies.    Policy makers of CPEs have been most reluctant to&#13;
implement such reforms, particularly with respect to consumer markets, in a&#13;
comprehensive  way.    In order   to carry   out  the  economic  decentralization&#13;
intentions and yet to preserve domestic price autonomy, the bulk of the CPEs&#13;
enacted surrogates for the exchange rate by currency zone and as a rule also&#13;
by type of economic activity. This together with the need to regulate some or&#13;
all kinds of foreign transactions that are in se difficult to control has&#13;
entailed a very complex multiple exchange rate system in all CPEs of concern&#13;
here. Only Hungary has to some degree eased the complexity, but it has by no&#13;
means removed it altogether.&#13;
Exchange rate surrogates are usually _alculated on the basis of some&#13;
relationship between domestic and foreign prices of some type of activities&#13;
and then modified upwards or downwards depending on whether the CPE wishes to&#13;
promote those transactions or chooses to discourage them.      Such computations&#13;
may be used in planning and decision making or, as recently in some countries,&#13;
in  actual  transactions.    The  surrogates  used  for  planning   purposes  are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
normally not published and are not discussed in greater detail for lack of&#13;
information. However, all those that are publicized or can be documented from&#13;
official and quasi-official sources are discussed in some detail.&#13;
With regard to transferable ruble transactions, the following rates are&#13;
analyzed: the official, internal, commercial, noncommercial, tourist, joint&#13;
investment as well as a few miscellaneous activity exchange rates.      Nearly an&#13;
equally large variety of exchange rates exists for convertible currency&#13;
transactions. The following are discussed in the paper: the official, the&#13;
commercial, tourist, internal, support, travel, and a few miscellaneous&#13;
activity exchange rates.   The rates that are of most interest for the purpose&#13;
of macroeconomic comparisons are some of the commercial, internal and joint&#13;
investment rates.&#13;
The paper argues the following propositions: (i) since the early postwar&#13;
period, the CPEs have adhered to a system of multiple exchange rates and no&#13;
single relation is capable of bridging the gap between foreign trade and&#13;
domestic wholesale prices, except for purely statistical purposes; (ii) each&#13;
exchange rate is targeted at a different type of foreign transaction; (iii)&#13;
the efforts of the authorities to set an "equilibrium rate" for selected&#13;
activities are frequently encumbered with other policy objectives; (iv) the&#13;
variety of foreign economic transactions can basically be segregated, although&#13;
not nearly perfectly, because the policy makers of CPEs have virtually full&#13;
control over the entire foreign ex&amp;iaange market; (v) for several types of&#13;
transactions the corresponding exchange rates are selected on the basis of a&#13;
more or less realistic relationship between actual domestic wholesale and&#13;
foreign prices; and (vi) few CPEs make a serious attempt to maintain a&#13;
realistic relationship between domestic and foreign prices of selected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
transactions on a nearly continuous basis, even if the one declared at the&#13;
start was intended to and did indeed reflect true proportions.&#13;
The multiplicity of exchange rates in the CPEs is a severe hindrance to&#13;
arriving at proper international comparisons of aggregate magnitudes expressed&#13;
in local currency units. Because most rates are tailored to a specific type&#13;
of transaction and are realistic only at or near the time when they become&#13;
effective, the desired kind of international comparison, the countries&#13;
involved, and its specific time reference are crucial in justifying the&#13;
selection of one declared exchange rate over another.       It is unquestionably&#13;
better to compute conversion factors on the basis of some kind of purchasing&#13;
power comparison either by disaggregating the macroeconomic magnitudes into&#13;
well identifiable components, for which prices can be established, or into&#13;
broad categories, for which one or another of the declared exchange rates&#13;
appears to be appropriate.&#13;

EXCHANGE RATES IN EASTERN EUROPE--TYPES, DERIVATION, APPLICATION&#13;
by Jozef M. van Brabant *&#13;
A country's exchange rate is basically the price of foreign currency in&#13;
terms of domestic currency units or the inverse of this ratio.          As such it&#13;
should be determined as but one of many prices encountered in an economy by the&#13;
demand for and supply of that foreign currency.          However,  in view of the&#13;
importance of foreign economic transactions, the precise level of the exchange&#13;
rate may have profound implications for the feasible degree of economic&#13;
stability especially in comparatively small open market economies (MEs). Policy&#13;
makers are therefore likely to pay particular attention to the "proper" exchange&#13;
rate and tend to "monitor" the functioning of foreign exchange markets more than&#13;
the price-formation mechanisms typical of most other economic activities.      In a&#13;
system with unhindered market access, only one foreign exchange market for a&#13;
given type of currency (e.g., spot dollar) can exist; a uniform exchange rate is&#13;
therefore bound to emerge for any divergence would be quickly evened out by&#13;
domestic  or  foreign   arbitrage.    However,  the  prevailing  reality   in most&#13;
countries is that a variety of formal and informal obstacles stand in the way of&#13;
unhindered access and entail a network of exchange rates.       Both the level and&#13;
fluctuations of the exchange rates depend on how successful the authorities are&#13;
in segmenting the foreign exchange market.&#13;

Exchange regulations in MEs vary considerably.    Even in industrialized&#13;
open MEs financial markets rarely operate without government "guidance".&#13;
Because of the nature of the centrally planned economies (CPEs) and the high&#13;
degree of economic control centralized at the macroeconomic level, foreign&#13;
exchange "markets" there differ measurably from those found in most MEs.       For&#13;
systemic characteristics, most CPEs maintain a plethora of exchange rates each&#13;
of which is applicable to separate markets in which arbitrage occurs only to a&#13;
limited extent.&#13;
This paper surveys the various exchange rates that have recently been&#13;
in use in the Eastern European CPEs of concern here./l No attempt will be made&#13;
in this paper to come to grip with the intrinsic role of the exchange rate and&#13;
how it ought to or could be determined in the light of the specific set of&#13;
policy objectives sought by socialist economies.     Instead, the paper identifies&#13;
the various exchange rates actually in use; it clarifies how these rates are&#13;
determined,  their role   in economic accounting and decision making, and the&#13;
recent shifts, if any, in how these rates have been selected and applied over&#13;
time; finally, it evaluates briefly to what extent these rates might be used to&#13;
compare macroeconomic magnitudes expressed in national currency units of two or&#13;
more CPEs with each other or with similar data for MEs.&#13;
Section 1 briefly sets forth the overall role of the exchange rate in&#13;
the socialist planned economy.     The basic exchange policy considerations that&#13;
have governed recent fluctuations in the determination and application of the&#13;
most important exchange rates are specified in Section 2. The various types of&#13;

exchange rates presently in use in Eastern Europe are defined in Section 3 for&#13;
clearing in transferable rubles and in section 4 for convertible currency&#13;
transactions.    Finally,  the paper concludes with a short digression on the&#13;
usefulness of the various exchange rates for cross-country comparisons of&#13;
macroeconomic data.&#13;
Section 1: THE ROLE OF THE EXCHANGE RATE IN A PLANNED ECONOMY&#13;
The two foremost factors determining in practice the role of the&#13;
exchange rate and overall policy guidelines on foreign exchange markets in a&#13;
traditional CPE are the prevalence of far-reaching administrative controls over&#13;
economic transactions and the great degree of autonomy over domestic price-&#13;
formation sought by central decision-makers.    Especially crucial is, on the one&#13;
hand, the sharp dichotomy between domestic prices and prices actually&#13;
encountered in foreign transactions and, on the other, the dual system of&#13;
producer or wholesale and consumer or retail prices, whose level and structure&#13;
are kept apart by a plethora of taxes and subsidies.       Instead of promoting a&#13;
parametric microeconomic link between domestic and foreign trade prices through&#13;
one or more operative exchange rates, CPE policy makers in most instances&#13;
deliberately enact only a macroeconomic link via the central budget: purchases&#13;
abroad are sold domestically and sales abroad are procured at home at the&#13;
centrally-set fiat price; the difference between the foreign currency price&#13;
converted in local currency by way of the exchange rate and the domestic price&#13;
is absorbed by the central budget via a special price-equalization account which&#13;
is usually administered by the central bank. To the extent that the balance of&#13;
payments in foreign currency prices is in equilibrium, the level of the exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rate does not at all influence the size of the net subsidies or taxes incurred&#13;
by the government budget.    If that balance is not in equilibrium, the level of&#13;
the exchange rate will codetermine the precise volume of subsidies or taxes.&#13;
However, as far as the economy as a whole is concerned, the precise level of the&#13;
exchange rate does not really matter very much, except for bookkeeping purposes,&#13;
to the extent that the central authorities successfully plan economic&#13;
activities.&#13;
Policy makers in CPEs have an inherent penchant for controlling trade&#13;
directly.    This  parallels  the desire   of socialist   planners  to centralize&#13;
economic decision-making as much as possible in order to marshal available&#13;
resources primarily for rapid industrialization through capital formation.     The&#13;
overwhelming preference of planners for attaining and supporting domestic price&#13;
autonomy, which is one of the crucial reasons for divorcing domestic and foreign&#13;
trade markets, stems largely from the nature and application of the detailed&#13;
physical planning system in these countries.     Because of the nearly inflexible&#13;
annual planning process it is preferable to implement the ex ante plan in as.&#13;
stable  an  environment,  including  transaction  prices,  as attainable.     Also&#13;
crucial is the policy objective to ward off uncontrolled price pressures that&#13;
may build up as a result of unanticipated changes in foreign trade prices.&#13;
In other words, the exchange rate is a purely passive instrument among&#13;
the traditional modus operandi for policy formulation in CPEs.     Changes in the&#13;
overall level of the exchange rate therefore have little bearing on the volume,&#13;
the broad geographical direction, and the commodity composition of exports and&#13;
imports; however, exchange rate fluctuations induced by shifts in international&#13;
financial markets do, of course, influence the specific geographical direction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
of  trade,  especially   the  distribution  of  the   trade  volume  earmarked  for&#13;
principal trade or currency zones/2 in the central plan.&#13;
The only major exception to the rule that the volume and commodity&#13;
composition of trade, and to some extent also its direction, are largely&#13;
independent of the exchange rate is the direct consumption of goods and services&#13;
by foreign tourists, diplomats, foreign commercial or financial representatives,&#13;
and private spending by those who obtain remittances from abroad.      This is the&#13;
one area where the exchange rate in a CPE performs exactly the same function as&#13;
it does in MEs.&#13;
The foregoing broad considerations, which will be further refined in&#13;
Section 2, demonstrate that the exchange rate in a traditional socialist economy&#13;
is largely a passive instrument in the formulation and implementation of&#13;
economic policy regarding trade, the formation of domestic prices, and resource&#13;
allocation in general.    It needs therefore not be pegged at a "proper" level,&#13;
and usually is not.    The question of relating domestic currency magnitudes of&#13;
CPEs to those for other countries, including other CPEs for the degree of&#13;
divergence between the actual exchange rate and the proper one differs markedly&#13;
from country to country, needs therefore an ad hoc answer.         In view of the&#13;
substantial dichotomy between foreign and domestic prices, on the one hand, and&#13;
producer and consumer prices in CPEs, on the other hand, the precise terms of&#13;
reference for international comparisons must be spelled out in detail in order&#13;
to justify one exchange rate rather than another.       Of particular importance,&#13;
especially in international comparisons of macroeconomic magnitudes, is the gap&#13;
/2 Usually differentiated for socialist, nonsocialist clearing partners, and&#13;
convertible currency partners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
between any of the many exchange rates in use in CPEs and the purchasing power&#13;
parity.  The difference between the two concepts is all the more crucial in the&#13;
case  of  CPEs   that  trade  relatively  less   intensively  than  MEs  and  that&#13;
deliberately separate various domestic consumer and producer product and factor&#13;
markets from each other and foreign relations by a comprehensive system of price&#13;
subsidies and taxes that help to implement the policy objectives sought.&#13;
Insulating domestic from foreign economic relations may be a highly&#13;
desirable policy course at the time the CPE takes off on an intensive&#13;
industrialization strategy.   This is particularly so in the case of a relatively&#13;
underdeveloped economy that seeks an identity. Nevertheless, changes in foreign&#13;
economic relations or the successful implementation of shifts in policy makers'&#13;
attitudes with respect to the organization of economic activity or the goals of&#13;
development policies will as a rule be contingent on paying more attention to&#13;
the level and policy role of the exchange rate in a socialist economy.     This is&#13;
especially so once the planners start to exploit comparative advantage,&#13;
including in tourism, as a potentially important source of growth.    It will then&#13;
become advisable to set a reasonable exchange rate and to formulate a more&#13;
active exchange policy that can support and guide decentralized decision-&#13;
making. However, with the exception of Hungary in recent years, CPEs have been&#13;
extremely reluctant to revise basic domestic price policies that form part and&#13;
parcel of socialist distribution precepts at the same time that major changes&#13;
are sought in the foreign trade sector.     To implement one without the other, a&#13;
compromise had to be worked out by which the state monopoly of foreign trade and&#13;
payments (MFT) remained intact and the precise level of the exchange rate would&#13;
not generally matter.    At the same time, however, surrogates for the exchange&#13;
rate by currency zone and possibly also by type of economic activity were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
enacted.   Depending upon the prevailing degree of price heterogeneity and the&#13;
extent of pricing autonomy desired, the various CPEs adopted quite different&#13;
coefficients or foreign trade multipliers and started to embrace a foreign&#13;
exchange policy that focused not on the official exchange rate, which remained&#13;
as unimportant as during the heydays of the traditional CPE, but on patterning&#13;
surrogate exchange rates in support of the decentralized implementation of&#13;
socioeconomic policy.&#13;
Section 2: FOREIGN EXCHANGE REGIME AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES&#13;
The role of the exchange rate varies with the precise organizational&#13;
arrangements of the economy     in question.    As a rule,   a country's   foreign&#13;
exchange regime comprises the institutions and rules that govern foreign&#13;
currency transactions   in domestic markets.     As a component of the foreign&#13;
exchange regime, a country's exchange policy is the set of explicit or implicit&#13;
rules by which the authorities control or guide the acquisition and disposition&#13;
of foreign exchange in support of the formulation and implementation of other&#13;
socioeconomic policy goals.    The extent and degree to which foreign economic&#13;
transactions are regulated may range from fully uncontrolled exchange markets&#13;
with freely fluctuating exchange rates for all types of foreign exchange&#13;
transactions to complete proscription of any foreign exchange dealings by&#13;
residents as well as nonresidents except those benefiting from prior government&#13;
authorization.&#13;
While the aims underlying foreign exchange policy may well fail to be&#13;
fully transparent even to the country's own monetary authorities, they generally&#13;
derive from the perceived need to "protect" the domestic economy from unforeseen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
foreign economic disturbances against the backdrop of broad socioeconomic policy&#13;
considerations.    Usually  the concerns   center  on the country's    competitive&#13;
position in world trade and the role of exports as a source of employment and&#13;
economic growth, especially in small open economies.      In some instances, such&#13;
preoccupations dominate official exchange policies so overwhelmingly that&#13;
exchange markets are suppressed altogether as the central policy-makers&#13;
themselves assume complete control over foreign economic relations.     This is in&#13;
fact the case of the stylized traditional CPE.&#13;
1. The Traditional CPE&#13;
Given the institutional and policy characteristics of the traditional&#13;
CPE (see Section 1), the level of the exchange rate is completely irrelevant, at&#13;
least in principle.   Foreign economic transactions are independent of financial&#13;
flows as they depend on prior plan decisions referring to input availability and&#13;
output distribution in real terms.   If the exchange rate threatens to operate in&#13;
areas where the authorities fail to wield full control, corrective measures are&#13;
announced whenever these contraventions are sufficiently weighty to the&#13;
realization of other goals underlying the passive foreign exchange regime; in&#13;
truly marginal cases, the authorities simply tacitly allow these limited markets&#13;
to operate within their narrowly circumscribed confines.&#13;
In the immediate postwar period, the Eastern European CPEs tried to&#13;
pursue a fully autonomous economic policy through rigid central and nearly&#13;
exhaustive control over foreign transactions; a positive exchange rate policy&#13;
would therefore have been redundant in any case. Inasmuch as it was intertwined&#13;
with the aspirations of policy makers to confine the scope of foreign trade to&#13;
what was absolutely necessary in order to pursue rapid industrialization, the&#13;
traditional CPE's exchange rate policy was largely passive and tended to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
implicit in the answers given by the central planner to the three basic trade&#13;
questions (what, how much, and where to trade). Further, the preponderant share&#13;
of trade was exclusively appropriated for intragroup trade on the basis of&#13;
strict bilateral trade and payments agreements denominated in a conventional&#13;
clearing   currency.    Under   bilateralism  actual   trade  prices  are   usually&#13;
negotiable  and  the  exchange   rate  becomes meaningless.     Only  the specific&#13;
geographical distribution of the predetermined planned volume of trade with&#13;
nonclearing partners could possibly be influenced by the exchange rate.&#13;
However, at fixed gold parity rates the comparative evolution of prices in MEs,&#13;
rather than the CPE's exchange rate policies, was in principle a guideline to&#13;
identifying actual export and import markets.      Only to the extent that other&#13;
than merchandise and merchandise-related transactions were allowed without prior&#13;
government approval was a more positive policy required, although it did not&#13;
emerge in most cases.     Since the countries sought to discourage tourism and&#13;
trade delegations, did not condone direct foreign investment, and resorted to&#13;
capital flows only in highly exceptional cases and then mostly in the form of&#13;
tied real flows negotiated ex ante, it would have been meaningless to formulate&#13;
a comprehensive positive foreign exchange policy for as long as the authorities&#13;
chose to hold on to the other aspects of their foreign exchange regime.&#13;
However, even in a traditional centralized CPE with comprehensive&#13;
physical planning and complete control over foreign transactions, the particular&#13;
exchange rate selected has not been completely neutral.        Tourism and private&#13;
remittances from abroad (gifts, royalties, honoraria, and the like) are obvious&#13;
instances in which the conversion rate matters. The same applies to diplomatic&#13;
and trade representatives.     Also, while the exchange rate may be a passive&#13;
policy instrument in the traditional CPE, the correct price of foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
can nevertheless be a pivotal factor in correct planning.        It is even more&#13;
relevant in conveying the proper incentives for decentralized microeconomic&#13;
decisions.    This  is particularly  important  in cases where trade cannot be&#13;
completely circumscribed by ex ante planning and "local management" will have to&#13;
fill  in gaps or    resolve  contradictions  in plan   instructions.   The actual&#13;
exchange rate may also influence the results from trade for foreign trade&#13;
enterprises on which in some instances depend accounting profitability and,&#13;
hence,  the  premiums  and  other  incentives  distributed   to those  engaged   in&#13;
trade.  Finally, for many import goods a domestic price-equivalent may well fail&#13;
to  be  readily   available.    In  order  to  resolve   practical  problems,  the&#13;
transaction price may then be based on the landed cost at the official exchange&#13;
rate. These are a few of the instances in which the exchange rate has real, as&#13;
distinct from bookkeeping, effects even in the case of merchandise transactions&#13;
proper.&#13;
The problem of setting the price of foreign exchange correctly is on&#13;
the whole but one aspect of the more general issue of appropriate domestic price&#13;
formation.   While the planners of a traditional CPE are keenly aware of the&#13;
undesirable allocatory implications of operating with an improper exchange rate,&#13;
there is little that can be done in one sweep to realign the exchange rate and&#13;
the corresponding regime.    The appropriate mechanism for linking the domestic&#13;
economy with transactions abroad has been the subject of extensive debates in&#13;
the CPEs, and a number of countries have sought substantial reforms of their&#13;
foreign trade and exchange models to allow for a more active exploitation of&#13;
comparative advantage.    However, most of these reforms have generally fallen&#13;
short of expectations because policy makers have on the whole been quite&#13;
reluctant to relinquish autonomy in domestic price-formation and in economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
decisions in general. Unable or unwilling to adjust the official value of their&#13;
currencies, yet interested in imparting a greater degree of realism in the&#13;
allocation process, the CPEs have gradually elaborated a complex and sometimes&#13;
ingenious network of surrogates or substitutes for the official exchange rate.&#13;
Starting with the early 1950s, the latter's function was more and more confined&#13;
to that of a notional bookkeeping magnitude and uniform denominator of&#13;
statistics of foreign transactions.&#13;
The precise guidelines underlying the determination of the Eastern&#13;
European exchange rates in many cases are obscure, and sources differ on their&#13;
rationale (see below). Even if the original exchange rate had been set in order&#13;
to secure balanced external payments or to reflect purchasing power, the&#13;
implementation of a high degree of domestic price autonomy, the drastic&#13;
buffering of producer or wholesale prices from consumer or retail prices in the&#13;
domestic economy as a means of implementing social distribution aims, the&#13;
insulation of domestic prices from movements in prices abroad, and the generally&#13;
passive foreign exchange regime guaranteed that the exchange rate quickly became&#13;
unrealistic for allocatory decisions.      Not only that,    the degree of price&#13;
autonomy achieved made it virtually impossible to select one single indicator of&#13;
purchasing power parity or equilibrium in the balance of payments, except in the&#13;
purely statistical sense at a given moment of time.&#13;
2.   The Modified Planned Economy&#13;
The purely nominal character of the official exchange rate of the&#13;
traditional CPE, as explained, has not mattered much to the selection and&#13;
implementation of foreign economic policy goals. Once the authorities, however,&#13;
seek to delegate responsibilities and decision-making authority to decentralized&#13;
units, wish to exploit foreign markets as a possibly essential means of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
buttressing relatively buoyant growth, or look more favorably upon tourism in a&#13;
broad sense as an alternative or supplementary source of foreign exchange, a&#13;
more positive foreign exchange policy and more realistic exchange rates or&#13;
substitutes have to be elaborated.&#13;
Certainly, in reality one does not encounter purely traditional or&#13;
fully modified CPEs, and the transition policies from one state (say, the&#13;
Stalinist command system) to a reformed socialist economy (possibly the current&#13;
Hungarian variant) should therefore be of prime interest. The crucial questions&#13;
to be resolved at the time the authorities decide to reform parts of the&#13;
traditional CPE concern not so much the determination and selection of the&#13;
proper exchange rate, which if understood to mean the computation of the&#13;
equilibrium exchange rate in a CPE, will undoubtedly entail knotty problems.&#13;
The more meaningful problems in this connection pertain to the formulation of an&#13;
exchange rate policy that will help to ensure that the exchange rate, perhaps&#13;
after some transition, reaches a realistic level and that this realism will be&#13;
maintained in time without doing away altogether with the buffering of markets&#13;
and yielding the economic autonomy so much prized in the traditional CPE.       In&#13;
other words, if the authorities were to decide to tolerate a certain degree of&#13;
freedom in price formation they could simply let the exchange rate find its own&#13;
level on a continuous basis or by discrete adjustments.&#13;
The exchange rate policy that emerged under the impulse of attempts to&#13;
reform the traditional CPE differed sharply between the various countries and&#13;
has been changed more or less drastically over the past 20 years or so.&#13;
Generally speaking, all CPEs sought the benefit of a proper exchange rate&#13;
without yielding full control over foreign economic decisions.      They therefore&#13;
adopted an exchange rate surrogate (a coefficient or multiplier) that would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
reflect the average relationship between domestic wholesale and export prices in&#13;
at least two, and possibly three, different trade regimes:        the transferable&#13;
ruble (or previously ruble) trade zone, the convertible currency regime, and, in&#13;
some cases, the clearing regime with developing countries. Since prices in each&#13;
of these types of trade relations differ markedly, the utilization of average&#13;
price ratios as guidelines for trade policy decisions was obviously required.&#13;
In this connection, it may be instructive to distinguish between the&#13;
coefficient that relates the valuta or deviza price (i.e., the foreign currency&#13;
price converted at the official exchange rate) to the domestic wholesale price&#13;
and the multiplier that is a direct surrogate for the exchange rate./3 In this&#13;
paper, the former will be called the internal exchange rate (IER) while the&#13;
latter will be referred to as the commercial exchange rate if officially quoted&#13;
and as the trade multiplier otherwise.      From an economic point of view, the&#13;
former is undoubtedly the more important of the two for reasons to be explained&#13;
below.   For practical purposes, however, the IER is oftentimes disaggregated&#13;
into different rates by trade partner (or currency zone), trade direction&#13;
(exports or imports), and commodity groups (especially fuels and raw materials,&#13;
foodstuffs, manufactured consumer goods, and investment goods), while the trade&#13;
multiplier is usually defined as an overall average ratio of trade and domestic&#13;
prices  of more   limited use in actual     plan formulation and    implementation.&#13;
Especially the IERs but also the trade multipliers are potentially of crucial&#13;
/3 In what follows, the emphasis will be chiefly on exchange rates actually&#13;
used in economic transactions involving foreign trade. In addition to the&#13;
rates cited here, there are a host of coefficients for experimental and&#13;
planning purposes that are not used in the clearing of actual economic&#13;
transactions. While they are ignored here, some such rates are detailed&#13;
especially in the Czechoslovak and Polish country papers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14i -&#13;
interest for international comparisons     (see Section 5).     Unfortunately,  the&#13;
specific magnitude of these rates and shifts in time are in most cases not&#13;
published on a continuous basis./4&#13;
The computation and practical application of IERs or multipliers gained&#13;
considerable momentum at the time of the wide-ranging debates about the&#13;
desirability, format, and preferred evolvement of the economic reforms in the&#13;
mid-1960s.   While many features of the reforms were abrogated in the aftermath&#13;
of the Czechoslovak crisis of 1968-1969, the role of these coefficients as&#13;
guides to macroeconomic resource allocation and, in the case of the IERs, also&#13;
in support of enterprise decision-making and price formation was strengthened.&#13;
These ratios have been especially important in imparting greater realism to the&#13;
wholesale price system, reducing the gap between consumer and producer price&#13;
levels, and modifying relative consumer prices, albeit to a far more modest&#13;
degree than envisaged for producer prices.&#13;
The IER is as a rule specified as the ratio between domestic prices of&#13;
traded goods and the corresponding deviza prices per commodity group, trade&#13;
direction,  or currency zone,    or a combination    thereof.   The foreign trade&#13;
multiplier, on the other hand, is the ratio between domestic and actual foreign&#13;
trade  prices  at   some  point  of  time,  and  is  therefore   an  exchange  rate&#13;
surrogate. The advartage of keeping the two concepts separate is that foreign&#13;
trade multipliers usually vary with shifts in the official exchange rate, as in&#13;
/4  There is undoubtedly a great deal of discrete information that could be&#13;
assembled from the readily available as well as abstruse country&#13;
literature. It would clearly be useful to compile these data syste-&#13;
matically and to clarify their methodological background, representa-&#13;
tiveness, applicability, and the like. However, this task transcends the&#13;
purposes of this paper. But I would be most grateful for any apposite&#13;
information that readers may wish to bring to my attention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
the case of the dollar since the early 1970s, while the IERs are kept constant&#13;
for a comparatively lengthy period of time. For example, while the dollar trade&#13;
multiplier for Hungary changed in tandem with shifts in the official exchange&#13;
rate,  the corresponding IER remained unchanged.       In other words, the trade&#13;
multiplier is usually a derived magnitude, while the IER is the one calculated&#13;
at certain intervals as the ex post average domestic cost of earning a deviza&#13;
unit in the export of some commodities or with some trade partners or both&#13;
during a comparatively long period of time; once established the IER tends to&#13;
remain valid for a similarly long period of time.      For example, the Hungarian&#13;
IERs, introduced in 1968, were computed on the basis of average price relations&#13;
of traded goods in 1960-1964; the IERs of 5.111 domestic forints per deviza&#13;
forint in dollar transactions and 3.067 for ruble transactions were in fact kept&#13;
unchanged until 1976 in spite of palpable changes in domestic and trade price&#13;
levels, the direction and commodity composition of trade, and relative trade and&#13;
domestic wholesale prices.     Similarly in Poland, where until 1970 the trade&#13;
transactions of the foreign trade enterprises had been effected at a special&#13;
exchange rate that was approximately six times the official one, IERs were&#13;
introduced in 1971 on the basis of the average relationship between the domestic&#13;
cost of exports and export revenues in 1967-1968.     Three zloty rates were set:&#13;
10 for ruble, 13 for other clearing currency (per dollar equivalent), and 15 per&#13;
dollar  for  convertible   currency  transactions.    It was   the policy makers'&#13;
intention to keep those rates in place for the entire five-year plan period&#13;
1971-1975. However, the rate for other clearing currency was eliminated in 1973&#13;
so that in effect there were IFRs for ruble and non-ruble transactions. This ex&#13;
ante setting of the IERs was expected to facilitate the bases upon which&#13;
enterprises were to formulate their trade decisions within the context of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
new reform attempts.     While the implicit dollar multiplier moved at regular&#13;
intervals, the corresponding IER was changed to 13 per dollar only in 1976 and&#13;
this was to remain valid until 1980.      Circumstances were such that the dollar&#13;
IER had to be revised in 1980 to 14.5, which remained in effect until the&#13;
introduction of publicly quoted commercial exchange rates in January 1982./5&#13;
The policies behind the selection and enactment of IERs have differed&#13;
greatly from country to country in part because the reform concepts at the roots&#13;
of the IERs were far from uniform but also because in practice the application&#13;
of the rates has deviated substantially from what was originally envisaged.&#13;
IERs were computed in order to serve as microeconomic allocatory guides in&#13;
nearly all CPEs and as a major policy instrument for those in charge of&#13;
macroeconomic choices in at least some CPEs. While some countries confined the&#13;
IER's role to experiments or the planning of economic decisions involving trade,&#13;
in others it filtered through into the actual trade accounting for decentralized&#13;
units, the formation of domestic prices, and even the promulgation of structural&#13;
adjustments.    The policies pursued originally envisaged the recomputation of&#13;
those rates at regular intervals (say, not more often than once a year) in order&#13;
to benefit from stability in the economic regulators for enterprise decision-&#13;
making, to profit from shifts in comparative advantage, and gradually to pass on&#13;
the real trade results to the microeconomic sphere.&#13;
How actual policies have differed from what was envisaged when the IERs&#13;
were first introduced can be illustrated for Hungary.     As noted, the ratios set&#13;
in 1968 on the basis of out-of-date average prices remained unchanged until 1976&#13;

when the IERs were combined with the official exchange rate to yield publicly&#13;
quoted commercial exchange rates (see below).      Since then, both the ruble and&#13;
the dollar commercial rates have been adjusted with some periodicity, although&#13;
much more flexibly for the dollar than for the ruble.        In the case of ruble&#13;
transactions, it is not exactly known how the redefinition of the commercial&#13;
exchange rate proceeds.    It appears highly probable, however, that changes have&#13;
been dictated largely by the attempts of Hungarian authorities to reduce the&#13;
average effect of the medium-term movement in intra-CMEA trade prices on the&#13;
domestic price level rather than by concerns about re-establishing external&#13;
balance.    Since Hungary's terms of trade vis-a-vis the ruble area declined&#13;
markedly in the 1970s, a depreciation of the currency would have been rational&#13;
if the Hungarian authorities had been bent on stimulating exports and&#13;
discouraging imports by indirect means, including an active exchange rate&#13;
policy.   Until 1976, Hungary apparently dispensed with an exchange rate policy&#13;
vis-a-vis the ruble as the multiplier remained at the level fixed in 1968.&#13;
Since then changes in the ruble commercial rate have been introduced rather&#13;
infrequently, but the appreciation of the forint has probably not been&#13;
sufficient to compensate for the serious deterioration of Hungary's terms of&#13;
trade with the ruble trade zone.&#13;
The precise role of the commercial exchange rate in Hungary since the&#13;
sharp price adjustments of 1979 is relatively well known:      it relates directly&#13;
domestic and foreign trade prices after adjustment for domestic transportation&#13;
costs, insurance charges, profit margins, and import duties or export&#13;
subsidies.   These factors play a role in both ruble and dollar transactions,&#13;
although certainly to a far larger extent in the case of trade with nonsocialist&#13;
countries than in ruble trade with CMEA partners where bilateral clearing at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
average prices cannot possibly be reconciled with an active exchange rate&#13;
policy.    Thus,  in spite of sizeable movements     in intra-CMEA trade prices,&#13;
Hungary has kept the ruble rate at 26 forints since November 3, 1981.&#13;
Policy considerations regarding movements of the dollar multiplier or&#13;
exchange rate before 1979 are not unambiguous.      After considerable hesitation&#13;
until about 1972-1973, Hungary apparently decided to utilize the multiplier and&#13;
later the commercial exchange rate of the dollar basically as a tool to preserve&#13;
purchasing power of the domestic forint-equivalent of traded goods by elimi-&#13;
nating on average the relative depreciation of the value of foreign currencies&#13;
to the forint stemming from different movements in domestic and foreign trade&#13;
prices during a comparatively long period of time. Actually, until about 1975,&#13;
the dollar multiplier and the official deviza forint rate were pegged to&#13;
movements in the value of the dollar relative to other convertible currencies.&#13;
The commercial exchange rate for the dollar has apparently been adjusted&#13;
according to the change of the value of the dollar relative to other convertible&#13;
currencies  of  importance  in  Hungary's  nonsocialist   trade./6   In spite of&#13;
frequent changes in the dollar multiplier and commercial exchange rate, the&#13;
revaluation of the forint has not been sufficiently strong to neutralize the&#13;
effect of average trade price changes on the domestic economy.&#13;
Hungary has gradually moved toward a regime with a transparent link&#13;
between  domestic  and  trade  prices.    Other CPEs,   however,  have  maintained&#13;
formidable  buffers  in the form of sectoral,     currency zone,   or directional&#13;
adjustment  factors  that  take  the place of multiple     IERs.   The commercial&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

exchange rate or trade multipliers in those countries tend to be a simple&#13;
statistical average of price relations by currency zone that may convey some&#13;
apposite information to planners; also, trade statistics are at times recorded&#13;
at those rates rather than the official ones. Price formation and microeconomic&#13;
decisions are influenced, if at all, by disaggregated trade multipliers or IERs&#13;
that are generally not well publicized.&#13;
Since the mid-1950s all CPEs at one point or another have computed IERs&#13;
for policy and allocatory guidance, but few countries have used them in order to&#13;
erect an effective bridge between domestic and trade prices or to act as a guide&#13;
for resolving basic trade questions even at the microeconomic level.       Further,&#13;
while all CPEs envisaged that such coefficients be recomputed with some&#13;
frequency (once a year or so), only few did.     This includes Czechoslovakia and&#13;
Poland; Hungary in effect also revised IERs by implicitly changing taxes and&#13;
subsidies that buffered domestic prices from trade prices. Other CPEs, however,&#13;
held on to the coefficients as originally established and instituted revisions&#13;
only infrequently (e.g., Romania).&#13;
Until recently, policies regarding IERs and trade multipliers have had&#13;
only marginal effects on exchange rate policies in most countries.       As noted,&#13;
Hungary in 1976 started quoting exchange rates on a regular basis and suspended&#13;
the official exchange rate altogether.    Poland followed suit in 1982.     Romania&#13;
has followed an independent policy with respect to the commercial exchange rate&#13;
which now coexists with the official one, although the former appears to be only&#13;
a policy goal rather than an operative decision instrument.          In fact,   the&#13;
effective IERs differ by sector or type of commodity, as they do in other CPEs&#13;
where IERs exist separately from the official exchange rate or even the nominal&#13;
commercial exchange rate (e.g., the German Democratic Republic).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
The impact of the IERs on economic organization, policy formulation,&#13;
and  decision  making  in  the  various  CPEs  has  been highly   varied.    While&#13;
originally all countries had slated those rates to be of major importance in&#13;
rendering the fiat prices more realistic, transforming the trade sector into a&#13;
pivotal source of growth, and guiding enterprise decision-making, the checkered&#13;
evolution of the economic reforms produced results that differed from country to&#13;
country and period to period.   All that need be said at this juncture is that a&#13;
uniform IER, at best, performed the role of an effective exchange rate for a&#13;
predetermined trade pattern.    At worst, multiple IERs helped entrepreneurs to&#13;
fill in gaps or to resolve contradictions in the plans, but had little impact on&#13;
resource allocation.&#13;
Since the rates described above relied upon some average relationship&#13;
between domestic wholesale and trade prices of some reference period and&#13;
predetermined trade pattern, even these surrogates could not help to regulate&#13;
demand and supply of goods and services denominated in other prices (e.g.,&#13;
retail prices for consumer goods and services in the case of tourism, private&#13;
remittances, expenditures of diplomatic and trade representatives, and so on).&#13;
To the extent that such activities were to be encouraged, something had to be&#13;
done about the distorted valuation of the Eastern European currencies.      Again,&#13;
instead of pursuing an active exchange rate policy in general, most CPEs&#13;
intermittently compared domestic and benchmark foreign prices for consumer goods&#13;
and services with a view towards selecting noncommercial premiums or&#13;
surcharges.   These are, however, rarely uniformly applied, they are ambiguously&#13;
defined, and those that are activated are changed only at infrequent intervals&#13;
with a view towards restoring purchasing power in that limited range of&#13;
activities.   Only Hungary succeeded in bridging the gap between consumer and&#13;
producer price levels.    The considerable changes in the structure of relative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
consumer and producer prices introduced in 1979-1980 enabled the authorities in&#13;
October 1981 to decree a uniform commercial exchange rate applicable also to&#13;
noncommercial transactions, at least in the case of convertible currencies.&#13;
A special set of issues derives from the fact that the CPE not only&#13;
works with two different types of domestic price systems, but also with two&#13;
widely diverging types of relative trade prices.      Since prices in trade among&#13;
the CPEs are in principle set, since 1975 annually, as averages of world market&#13;
prices over a relatively long period of time (usually five years) and are in&#13;
fact subject to considerable bilateral bargaining, it is not surprising that the&#13;
level and the structure of prices in trade among CPEs differ markedly from those&#13;
prevailing in east-west trade and, a fortiori, from those observed in trade&#13;
among MEs. This multiplicity of price systems has engendered critical practical&#13;
problems whenever one or more CPEs seek to implement a cherished principle of&#13;
regional or international economic cooperation.       Rather than search for the&#13;
roots of this type of problem, the authorities almost invariably decided for ad&#13;
hoc computations that can become very complex.       As a result, most CPEs have&#13;
recently further enlarged the already bewildering system of multiple exchange&#13;
rates.&#13;
From the economic as well as the organizational and accounting point of&#13;
view, then, it appears useful to distinguish rather rigidly between the network&#13;
of exchange rates that link a CPE with the convertible currency world and those&#13;
used for effecting various kinds of transactions among the members of the&#13;
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA)./7 Certainly, there is a formal&#13;

Mongolia, and Vietnam) will be ignored in this paper.&#13;

connection between the two sets provided by the gold parity relationship for all&#13;
CPEs, but this nexus is only nominal and hence not very helpful in unraveling&#13;
the separate international economic relations of the CMEA countries.&#13;
Section 3: EXCHANGE RATES IN INTRA-CMEA RELATIONS&#13;
Regarding intra-CMEA relations,/8 it is useful to distinguish at least&#13;
conceptually among the official, the internal, commercial, noncommercial,&#13;
tourist,  joint  investment,  and miscellaneous   activity exchange   rates.    The&#13;
determination, application, and realism of these various exchange rates will be&#13;
discussed in sequence below.&#13;
1.   The Official Exchange Rate&#13;
The determination and role of the official exchange rate of the&#13;
transferable ruble and dollar are similar for all CPEs.          Until the gradual&#13;
disintegration of the Bretton Woods system, the CPEs maintained perfect cross-&#13;
rates.   For the national currencies of the CPEs,      including the transferable&#13;
ruble, this is still so; in many cases, official exchange rates are now quoted,&#13;
if at all,/9 in a standard fashion against the transferable ruble only. In what&#13;
/8 Comments regarding transactions with other CPEs, except those effected in&#13;
convertible currencies (some or all of the transactions with China, Cuba,&#13;
and Yugoslavia), are quite similar to those pertaining to the transferable&#13;
ruble regime in the CMEA.&#13;
/9 The official value of the forint (also known as the deviza forint) since&#13;
1976, the zloty since 1982, and the leu since early 1983 are no longer&#13;
quoted by these CPEs. However, since there has not been an official&#13;
realignment of the gold parity, the other CMEA partners that do quote&#13;
individual official exchange rates keep pegging the forint, leu, and zloty&#13;
at the levels in force before the Hungarian, Polish, and Romanian&#13;
authorities suspended quotation. The official parity of the leu is also&#13;
quoted in International Financial Statistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
follows, comments can therefore be restricted to the parities maintained against&#13;
the transferable ruble./10&#13;
The rationale underlying the determination of the gold parity is not&#13;
unambiguous.    Many  Eastern  European  commentators   basically  claim  that  the&#13;
starting official exchange rates established mostly in the late 1940s or early&#13;
1950s reflected purchasing power parities between the local currency and one or&#13;
more reference convertible currencies, usually the U.S. dollar. Some countries,&#13;
including Bulgaria in 1962 and the Soviet Union in 1961, revised those earlier&#13;
parities ostensibly on the basis of changed price relationships between&#13;
convertible and the local currency.     In most instances, however, the practical&#13;
computations behind the currency definitions of the late 1940s and virtually in&#13;
all instances of later revisions were not motivated by a careful search for&#13;
realistic   "equilibrium   exchange  rates"   or   "purchasing   power   parities".&#13;
Certainly, for some CPEs such a detailed comparison between the local and main&#13;
international currency was carried out in the immediate postwar years/l1 and at&#13;
least the USSR's redefinition of the gold parity in 1961 was inspired by&#13;
considerations about reducing the volume of price-equalization tax and subsidy&#13;
/10 Transferable ruble and ruble quotations of individual CPEs do not differ,&#13;
although the cross-rate between the two calculated via dollar quotations&#13;
differs from unity (see below). This problem will be ignored at this&#13;
juncture.&#13;
/11 For example, Czechoslovakia established the koruna's gold parity in 1945&#13;
on the basis of the dollar's gold definition and the relationship between&#13;
prices in Czechoslovakia and those prevailing in the United Kingdom, the&#13;
United States, Sweden, and Switzerland evaluated at the official dollar&#13;
parities. This appears to have been undertaken according to the&#13;
principles of the then just established Bretton Woods monetary system of&#13;
which Czechoslovakia and incidentally also Poland were founder members.&#13;
The repricing of the gold parity of the koruna in May 1953 was not,&#13;
however, a reflection of a careful price comparison. For details, see&#13;
Vencovska 1979, pp. 814-815.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
transfers.   Apart from these few instances, the valuation of the local currency&#13;
appears to have been set largely by internal exigencies--in some cases motivated&#13;
by political prestige considerations--without really impinging upon the basic&#13;
factors underlying the determination of the gold content in the early postwar&#13;
period.&#13;
Even if the original parities had been based on a careful computation&#13;
of purchasing power parities applicable when the rates were instituted, it bears&#13;
stressing that the disequilibrium conditions of the early postwar years could&#13;
hardly have been conducive to the selection of an exchange rate appropriate in&#13;
subsequent years, even if only for notional purposes.        However,  since trade&#13;
decision-making especially in the context of CMEA relations was overwhelmingly&#13;
conditioned by the exigencies of central planning and did not directly impact&#13;
upon domestic economic conditions, the precise level of the exchange rate and&#13;
its inertia in time proved to be largely irrelevant. The national economic plan&#13;
in a traditional CPE simply prescribes what goods and how much should be traded;&#13;
the geographical direction of trade depends primarily on clearing opportunities&#13;
provided by bilateral trade and payments agreements, especially in intra-CMEA&#13;
trade and by extension in trade with other CPEs that adhere to rather rigid&#13;
bilateral trade planning.   Of course, deviations from the planned course are a&#13;
different matter altogether.&#13;
From the above, it can be concluded that the official exchange rate in&#13;
a CPE bears no relationship with reality, is not actually utilized in economic&#13;
transactions whenever it can be avoided, and has been largely confined to the&#13;
role of a uniform bookkeeping unit.    For the record, these units are listed in&#13;
the first column of Table 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
2. The Commercial Exchange Rate&#13;
The commercial exchange rate in this context can have two distinct&#13;
meanings: the rate at which actual trade flows are recorded but which has no&#13;
realistic value, just as the official gold parity exchange rate is meaningless;&#13;
and the rate at which actual foreign trade values are translated into local&#13;
currency units utilized in actual transactions by the foreign trade enterprises&#13;
and local producers which may or may not be the rate at which foreign economic&#13;
transactions are evaluated in overall trade decisions.     The rates are listed in&#13;
column 2 of Table 1.&#13;
a. Pro forma commercial exchange rate&#13;
Applies only to the German Democratic Republic, whose trade statistics&#13;
since the early 1960s have been recorded/12 at a special commercial exchange&#13;
rate (the Valutamark) initially set at the rate of the deutsche Mark and the&#13;
dollar (i.e., 4.2 DM per dollar), but since moved to some extent relative to the&#13;
dollar; the commercial rate to the ruble was originally derived as the official&#13;
cross-rate of the postwar gold parities of the mark.       The exception is trade&#13;
between the two Germanies which is effected on a special clearing account basis&#13;
for which the Valutamark and the deutsche Mark are treated as being identical.&#13;
This entails inconsistent trade statistics, even for east-west trade.&#13;
/12 Until 1965, the Soviet valuta ruble was used to record trade. Internal&#13;
accounting proceeded at the gold parity rate until 1958. As of 1 January&#13;
1959, the special Valutamark rate was introduced at par with the deutsche&#13;
Mark of 1959, but no convincing rationale for this decision has ever been&#13;
presented (see Nattland 1972, pp. 127-133).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
b. Functioning commercial exchange rate&#13;
As noted in Section 2, there are presently three CPEs that publicly&#13;
quote a commercial exchange rate:/13     Hungary, Poland, and Romania.    Further,&#13;
Czechoslovakia used to set commercial rates for ruble- and dollar-denominated&#13;
transactions, although current rates are more logically discussed under the&#13;
heading IER below than under the present one because they are not publicly&#13;
quoted and their determination and application differ from those in the other&#13;
CPEs enumerated here.&#13;
The commercial exchange rates when first set reflected some realistic&#13;
ratio between domestic wholesale and trade prices for the predetermined trade&#13;
pattern   with  socialist   and  nonsocialist   countries,  usually   confined   to&#13;
manufactured exports only. As an export incentive, the commercial exchange rate&#13;
may even be slightly undervalued, and perhaps more so for the dollar than for&#13;
the ruble in view of the fact that the ruble trade area is not really regulated&#13;
by  trade  incentives  and  foreign exchange availability.      Typical for these&#13;
commercial exchange rates is the relatively sharp depreciation of the commercial&#13;
ruble to the commercial dollar in comparison with the official cross-rate.&#13;
Inasmuch as the trade patterns of the CPEs differ more or less sharply, the&#13;
cross-rates implied in the commercial rates differ as well, and this may entail&#13;
knotty   reconciliation   problems   in  maintaining   comparable   foreign   trade&#13;
statistics./14&#13;
/13 Romania's quotations are, however, only available through the channels of&#13;
the International Monetary Fund, while Romanian organs continued to&#13;
publish the official exchange rates based on the gold parity until January&#13;
29, 1983 in Romania Libera.&#13;
/14 This was the case for Hungary in 1976, Romania in 1981, and Poland in&#13;
1982.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
It bears noting that while the commercial exchange rates may have been&#13;
an accurate reflection of relative domestic wholesale and dollar (resp. ruble)&#13;
trade prices when introduced, although there are considerable doubts about this&#13;
feature (see Section 2), a major problem has been their adjustment in time,&#13;
i.e.,   maintaining    a   realistic   exchange   rate   parity   for   commercial&#13;
transactions.    Commercial exchange rates are not always adjusted properly in&#13;
time with changes in relative domestic and trade prices, and are therefore not&#13;
in all cases the rates at which economic accounting and macroeconomic planning&#13;
take place.    The exchange rate adjustments tend to differ markedly from one&#13;
country to another, but generally follow the pattern of shifts in a basket of&#13;
main currencies for the dollar exchange rate (with other convertible currencies&#13;
being derived according to fluctuations in main financial markets); the ruble&#13;
exchange rate is adjusted at great intervals probably in line with changes in&#13;
relative ruble trade prices, although the available information is not always&#13;
unambiguous on that score.     In the case of Hungary, for example, the ruble's&#13;
commercial rate has been adjusted infrequently since 1976.     Although it is not&#13;
exactly known how the redefinition of the commercial exchange rate proceeds, it&#13;
appears highly probable that it reflects attempts by the Hungarian authorities&#13;
to reduce the average effect of the medium-term movement in intra-CMEA trade&#13;
prices on the domestic price level.&#13;
Romania in 1981 and Poland in 1982 established commercial exchange&#13;
rates that are expected to become operative links between trade and domestic&#13;
wholesale prices.   Whereas Romania selected parity between the ruble and dollar&#13;
(at 15 lei), the Polish devaluation of January 1982 to 80 zlotych per dollar&#13;
(from the "special" 34.9 in December 1981) did not entail an equivalent&#13;
redefinition of the ruble parity, which was set at 68 (as against 44.4 before)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
and has been maintained at that level since.     However, whereas Romania did not&#13;
eliminate the dichotomy between commercial and noncommercial rates, Poland&#13;
purports to have established uniformity, at least for convertible currency&#13;
transactions, but there is some doubt as to the accuracy at this claim (see&#13;
below).&#13;
The price methodology underlying the Romanian commercial exchange rates&#13;
remains unknown, although it is probably based on a ratio of trade prices by&#13;
currency zone and actual or anticipated domestic prices of the late 1970s, when&#13;
these rates were being debated.     In any case,   Romania has not yet eliminated&#13;
the multiple multipliers specific to some commodity groups and currency zones.&#13;
The price reference base of the Polish commercial exchange rates, as envisaged&#13;
in 1981 and utilized in the price reform introduced in 1982, was the average&#13;
export price ratio of the first half of 1981 except in the case of fuels, basic&#13;
raw materials, and other materials.    However, the actual exchange rates set in&#13;
1982 evolved as a political compromise between what economic calculations tended&#13;
to indicate and the perceived need for trade incentives (Wojciechowski 1982, pp.&#13;
6-7).    Changes since then have been based on shifts        in a basket of nine&#13;
currencies for dollar transactions.    The ruble rates have not changed at all.&#13;
It bears noting too that in the case of Romania the coefficient of 15 was kept&#13;
unchanged at least until the end of 1982./15&#13;
In other words, the commercial exchange rates in Poland and Romania&#13;
convey some apposite information to planners and trade statistics may be&#13;
/15 Since Romania does not publicly quote its commercial exchange rates and&#13;
International Financial Statistics reports only the dollar rate, it is not&#13;
clear whether the leu's devaluations of 1983 against the dollar have been&#13;
carried forward also against the ruble, thus preserving the parity&#13;
introduced in 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
recorded  at  those  rates   rather  than  the  official  ones.    However,  these&#13;
coefficients are only of limited usefulness in reaching concrete decisions about&#13;
trade and are probably a much weaker and less pervasive link between domestic&#13;
economic activity and foreign trade transactions than has been the case in&#13;
Hungary since 1968.    The chief reason for this will become apparent from a&#13;
discussion of IERs.&#13;
3.   Internal Exchange Rate (IER)&#13;
The coefficient between domestic wholesale prices and valuta or deviza&#13;
values was established for the first time in the mid-1950s when the CPEs began&#13;
to explore   the potential of trade as a source of economic growth.           Some&#13;
countries created separate coefficients at least for ruble or clearing currency&#13;
and dollar or convertible currency transactions, but most eventually resorted&#13;
explicitly or implicitly to an array of coefficients specifically tailored to&#13;
economic branches, commodity groups, direction of trade, or currency zones with&#13;
the explicit goal of influencing commercial decision-making of selected&#13;
enterprises.   This multiplicity was resorted to in recognition of the serious&#13;
distortion between domestic wholesale prices and intra-CMEA trade prices, on the&#13;
one hand, and intra-CMEA and world trade prices, on the other.        Reluctant to&#13;
embrace far-reaching price reforms, CPE policy makers were compelled to tailor&#13;
their decisions to relatively homogenous products as a means of avoiding&#13;
substantial windfall gains or losses for enterprises that would otherwise have&#13;
to be offset through a complex network of subsidies and taxes.&#13;
As noted, some CPEs combined the IERs with the official parity and&#13;
created trade multipliers or even so-called commercial rates.      However, to the&#13;
extent that reference is to the role of the coefficient in planning and&#13;
entrepreneurial decision-making, commercial exchange rates (as defined in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
preceding subsection) and IERs should be kept separate.       While both normally&#13;
have the same starting value, policies regarding the periodic adaptation of&#13;
these rates differ considerably not only among countries but specifically&#13;
between IERs and commercial rates.     In the case of Hungary, for example, the&#13;
dollar trade multiplier was periodically adjusted in line with parity changes in&#13;
financial markets, but the nominal IERs were kept constant and the effective&#13;
rates emerged implicitly from the frequent revisions in subsidies and taxes that&#13;
were designed to keep enterprises or broad economic sectors profitable and to&#13;
maintain domestic price autonomy.     In the case of Poland, however, no attempt&#13;
appears to have been made to adjust the implicit multipliers in line with shifts&#13;
in the official exchange rate. Furthermore, the effective IERs emerged in fact&#13;
in a much more differentiated pattern than the two or three rates per currency&#13;
zone tend to suggest.     Subsidies and taxes were the main vehicles by which&#13;
sector- or commodity-specific IERs emerged.&#13;
A surprising degree of inertia in adapting the IERs to fluctuating&#13;
internal and external relative price levels, not to mention considerable shifts&#13;
in the commodity composition and direction of exports, appears to be a feature&#13;
shared with the commercial exchange rates for nearly all CPEs for both the ruble&#13;
and the dollar rates.     In the case of ruble transactions, there are severe&#13;
conceptual problems in the application of the IER.     Not only differ intra-CMEA&#13;
prices from domestic and world prices, the bulk of that trade is cleared&#13;
bilaterally by government agencies.     One may suspect therefore that the ruble&#13;
IER is not a very good guideline to economic decisions. In the case of Hungary,&#13;
its role was confined to bringing intra-CMEA prices up to the level that&#13;
enterprises confronted in east-west trade with a bewildering variety of ad hoc&#13;
taxes and subsidies taking the place of explicit import duties and export&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
subsidies. In several CPEs the accounting of ruble trade proceeded at the ruble&#13;
coefficient but actual decisions relied only to a limited extent on that rate.&#13;
Effective IERs, i.e., the policy instruments used in trade decisions,&#13;
are as a rule not known./16    Nevertheless, to the extent that they more or less&#13;
correctly express relative price relations of a predetermined trade pattern of&#13;
some period, they could be of considerable use in building up internationally&#13;
comparable macroeconomic magnitudes for CPEs./17 The confines of this paper are&#13;
too narrow to permit an exhaustive compilation of the discrete information that&#13;
is sometimes cited in the pertinent Eastern European specialized literature.&#13;
Some implicit overall dollar and ruble coefficients are included in Table 3.&#13;
4. Noncommercial Exchange Rate&#13;
Access to CMEA markets is highly restricted and, for most purposes,&#13;
centrally controlled under the aegis of the MFT.     However, the CPEs do maintain&#13;
at least minimum direct contacts with aliens, for instance, through diplomatic,&#13;
trade, and financial representations; family ties; tourism; student exchanges;&#13;
private remittances; transfers of honoraria and royalties; and so forth.      There&#13;
are, therefore, by necessity instances in which the exchange rate has allocatory&#13;
effects, however important, even in the most insulated CPE.     Simple application&#13;
of the official exchange rate, although resorted to in the early postwar years,&#13;
/16 In addition to the IERs implied in the commercial rates quoted in Table&#13;
3, Czechoslovakia in 1968 introduced average IERs that were slightly&#13;
modified in later years. The dollar IER in 1970 was set at 3.75 and the&#13;
ruble's at 2.25. According to reliable sources, these rates were kept&#13;
intact until the end of 1980, when the dollar rate was reduced to 2.2.&#13;
Sectoral rates, however, were modified much more frequently, at least in&#13;
the case of the dollar. The Polish IERs are discussed in Section 2.&#13;
/17 For some sectoral calculations using the data available for Hungary, see&#13;

was not a very constructive solution because the substantial differences in the&#13;
level and structure of retail, wholesale, and trade prices would unavoidably&#13;
entail "nonequivalent exchange" among equal partners.&#13;
Initially, the CPEs opted to maintain special bilateral clearing&#13;
accounts for all forms of their mutual transactions not directly related to&#13;
trade./18 Each country kept book of expenditures and receipts in each other's&#13;
currency, and periodically the imbalances were verified and eliminated usually&#13;
by way of agreed deliveries of real goods./19       Since tourism was not at all&#13;
actively encouraged and the planners rigidly controlled market access, the sums&#13;
involved remained comparatively small.      In any case,   the windfall gains or&#13;
losses were such that they did not elicit strong pressure for reform.&#13;
Nevertheless, the issue became of some importance from the mid-1950s on&#13;
when, under the lead of the USSR, the CMEA members worked out uniform principles&#13;
for the computation of bilateral noncommercial exchange rates.       Imbalances on&#13;
noncommercial account could in principle be converted at the end of the calendar&#13;
year into commercial units if the two countries concerned opted to do so./20&#13;
The conversion coefficients were derived from a binary comparison of a market&#13;
basket of consumer goods and services that was bilaterally agreed upon. Such a&#13;
basket involved component weights derived from the expenditure pattern of a&#13;
/18 Insurance and commercial transportation charges were settled at the&#13;
official exchange rate by way of special tariff schedules patterned after&#13;
rate schedules of comparable MEs (e.g., the Western European passenger&#13;
and freight rates were periodically averaged and taken as guide for&#13;
intra-CMEA transportation charges).&#13;
/19 For more details, see Brabant 1977, pp. 257-261.&#13;
/20 The known facts about this and subsequent noncommercial exchange rate&#13;
computations, including the one introduced in 1975, are summarized and&#13;
referenced in Brabant 1977, pp. 261-279.&#13;

- 33 -&#13;
"typical diplomatic family with four members".      As a result, cross-rates for&#13;
noncommercial transactions were not uniform and this divergence led to some&#13;
friction during implementation. Also, it was agreed that the coefficients would&#13;
be reviewed periodically. In particular, in case of a price reform leading to a&#13;
change of 5 percent in the value of the reference basket new coefficients were&#13;
to be established automatically.&#13;
The gradually increasing interest in fostering contacts among the CPEs&#13;
made a uniform, consistent, and nearly automatic accounting of noncommercial&#13;
transactions  highly   desirable.    In  1963,  12 CPEs    (all  present  socialist&#13;
countries excepting Cuba and Yugoslavia) adopted a multilateral agreement on&#13;
consistent noncommercial exchange rates and a coefficient linking the Soviet&#13;
domestic   "consumer  ruble"   to  the  transferable   or  intra-CMEA   "commercial&#13;
ruble".   These rates were derived from a uniform sample of consumer goods and&#13;
services evaluated in domestic prices of the participants and in intra-CMEA&#13;
trade prices./21   The selected exchange rates, expressed relative to a unit of&#13;
official currency, including the link for the Soviet and transferable ruble, are&#13;
detailed in the bottom part of Table 1.&#13;
The 1963 system basically remained in force until early 1975/22 with&#13;
two principal exceptions. First, in late 1971, another linking coefficient for&#13;
/21 Obviously, there are no intra-CMEA prices for most consumer services.&#13;
For details about the solution adopted, see Brabant 1977, pp. 264-267.&#13;
/22 The 1971 and subsequent protocols were agreed upon only by the active&#13;
CMEA members, including Cuba since the mid-1970s and Vietnam since the&#13;
late 1970s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the ruble (2.3 instead of 3.4) was introduced retroactively to July 1, 1971./23&#13;
Second, the ability of the original coefficients to maintain "equivalent&#13;
exchange" was cast into doubt on a number of occasions.       Particularly the net&#13;
exporters of tourist services felt almost from the beginning that they obtained&#13;
the short end of the exchange because the sample did only inadequately reflect&#13;
the expenditure pattern of tourists.    This shortcoming, which was acknowledged&#13;
by a number of countries, was expected to be gradually eliminated as the&#13;
original  agreement   stipulated  that  the   rates  would  have  to  be  reviewed&#13;
periodically to insure equivalent exchange in time and any change exceeding 5&#13;
percentage points from average prices in the base-year should automatically&#13;
trigger a revision of the coefficients.     It bears stressing, however, that no&#13;
official revisions could be agreed upon in spite of considerable changes in&#13;
domestic and trade prices.    The issue was on the agenda of several high-level&#13;
meetings of the CMEA's Standing Commission dealing with currency and financial&#13;
questions, but unanimity eluded the negotiators.      However, since the accounts&#13;
were basically kept bilaterally and the balance could, but needed not, be&#13;
transferred to the commercial account at the International Bank for Economic&#13;
Cooperation (IBEC) from January 1, 1964 on, there was some scope for "ad hoc&#13;
coefficients",   and  a   number   of  countries   availed   themselves   of  this&#13;
opportunistic loophole.&#13;
/23 Outstanding balances as of July 1, 1971 were to be converted at the old&#13;
rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
In late 1974, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic,&#13;
Hungary, and the USSR agreed upon the introduction of new coefficients on March&#13;
1, 1975./24    Poland joined this system on January 1, 1976.        Although not a&#13;
signatory of the multilateral agreement,      Romania appears to have joined the&#13;
system as a result of bilateral agreements worked out concurrently with&#13;
renegotiations of the multilateral one. The new rates were calculated according&#13;
to   a  revised   methodology.      Although   the   CPEs   tried   to  raise   the&#13;
representativeness of the sample and approximate better the typical composition&#13;
of the normal volume of noncommercial transactions within the CMEA area, it&#13;
remained basically biased in favor of the expenditure pattern of diplomats.&#13;
Further, the CPEs decided to treat tourist transactions separately from other&#13;
noncommercial   transactions   (see  below).     For  all  intents   and  purposes,&#13;
therefore, the system agreed upon in 1963 was kept intact with perhaps some fine&#13;
tuning for other than tourist transactions proper.&#13;
Since  1975, four   further  changes  appear   to have  been   effectively&#13;
enacted, although not all of them were agreed upon multilaterally.       On January&#13;
1, 1978, the ruble-linking coefficient was reduced to 1.9 and in August 1981 to&#13;
1.7 --the latter becoming effective probably as of January 1, 1982, but the&#13;
/24 The new coefficients should have come into effect as of January 1,&#13;
1975. However, Poland and Romania's equanimity and practical problems&#13;
with the exact calculation of these rates delayed the application. In&#13;
fact, new rates were announced with some intervals throughout the&#13;
beginning of that year. I have indicated March 1, 1975 because it was&#13;
then that Hungary announced a complete set. It was also then that the&#13;
new agreement was signed by the five CPEs plus Mongolia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
sources are ambiguous on that score./25       Further, in late 1981, the members&#13;
apparently   agreed  upon  new   coefficients  altogether.     Unfortunately,   the&#13;
available information supports only major changes for the zloty, while other,&#13;
minor changes appear to have been basically unsynchronized variations/26 on the&#13;
old noncommercial parities./27 The Soviet Union announced major changes in its&#13;
noncommercial exchange rates effective October 1, 1983 (Financial Times, October&#13;
6, 1983, p.2), but details are lacking at this juncture.&#13;
5. Tourist Exchange Rate&#13;
Especially for "unorganized flows", tourist transactions have been&#13;
tightly controlled in Eastern Europe.     Organized tourist services are paid for&#13;
in local currency and settled at the ministerial or banking level by official&#13;
tourist  organizations.     Because  of  the  inherent  bilateral  nature   of  the&#13;
/25 In late 1981 and early 1982 one CPE after another announced changes in&#13;
their noncommercial exchange rates, especially for the zloty. However, no&#13;
strong confirmation for an overall changed system of central rates has&#13;
emerged but it is clear that the linking ruble coefficient was reduced to&#13;
1.7. Wesolowski 1983, p. 17 mentioned that this was instituted on&#13;
January 1, 1981, but the source referred to in Table 1 indicates that the&#13;
new coefficient was agreed to only in late 1981. Perhaps it was&#13;
introduced retroactively. The information in Table 1 is therefore&#13;
tentative.&#13;
/26 As a matter of fact, the noncommercial exchange rates published by&#13;
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania show palpable&#13;
divergences, with major changes becoming effective on July 1, 1981 for&#13;
the koruna and the ruble and on November 1, for the mark and zloty&#13;
according to the Bulgarian tables and on either July 1 or August 1, 1982&#13;
for the zloty once more; Czechoslovakia reported changes as of July 1,&#13;
1981 for the lev and forint and on December 1 for the zloty (with a&#13;
further devaluation for the zloty on March 1, and July 1, 1982); Hungary,&#13;
by contrast, reported a change on August 1, 1981 for the ruble, on Octo-&#13;
ber 1 for the koruna and zloty; on October 13, 1981 and February 9, 1982&#13;
for the zloty, and on December 29, for the mark, and June 8, 1982 for the&#13;
zloty; Romania reported only a change in the zloty rate.&#13;
/27 This considerably complicates the computation of the IER between non-&#13;
commercial and commercial currency units. The rates in Table 1 are those&#13;
given in most sources, except the value of the zloty which has been&#13;
determined by the Polish devaluation of 55 percent enacted in February&#13;
1982.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
negotiations about the plan of the reciprocal exchange of tourist services for&#13;
some period, effective exchange rates for such transactions are imprecise,&#13;
subject as they are to pervasive bilateral bargaining.        Since the effective&#13;
exchange rates are really implicit in the reciprocal determination of available&#13;
tour packages, they are not normally disclosed and will therefore not be further&#13;
discussed  here.     It  bears  stressing,  though,  that   organized  tourism  has&#13;
traditionally accounted for the lion share of the volume of intra-CMEA tourist&#13;
transactions, although there may have been some slippage in the 1970s.&#13;
Unorganized tourism has been highly circumscribed/28 by detailed&#13;
passport controls and tight restrictions on the sums that can be freely&#13;
exchanged for currency of another CMEA country. Although in principle available&#13;
up to March 1963 at the bilateral noncommercial rates and since April 1963 at&#13;
the multilateral noncommercial rates, actual tourist rates appear to depend&#13;
heavily  on  the  "tourist  policy"   of  the  individual  CPE  concerned  and,  in&#13;
particular, on the state of the bilateral noncommercial payments balance.       The&#13;
same holds with respect to the amount of currency that can be freely exchanged.&#13;
In late 1973, the CMEA members agreed upon a more flexible exchange&#13;
regime that included a more generous maximum exchange limit, new tourist&#13;
exchange rates, and more comprehensive rules on the setting of such exchange&#13;
rates. Together with the introduction of the new noncommercial rates in early&#13;
/28 The only exception was the comparatively free tourist zone for the German&#13;
Democratic Republic and Poland that was agreed upon in 1972 but abolished&#13;
in late 1977 because of severe imbalances in favor of Poland. These&#13;
emerged soon after the establishment of the free zone as Polish citizens&#13;
crossed the border in far greater number than anticipated and went on&#13;
buying sprees. With the growing dislocations in Poland and the&#13;
tightening of consumer supplies in Germany, the situation became&#13;
intolerable in the mid-1970s and the unique experiment with the free&#13;
reciprocal access to each other's market was gradually curbed and finally&#13;
abolished by administrative means.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
1975, the participating countries (including since 1976 Poland and probably&#13;
Romania) can establish tourist exchange rates within a 10 percent band around&#13;
the reference rates.     With effect from February 1,     1981, this band can be&#13;
expanded bilaterally to 20 percent around the central rate, at least for the&#13;
countries that signed the multilateral agreement of late 1974./29       Since such&#13;
changes need not be coordinated with other partners uniform cross-rates for&#13;
tourist transactions need not prevail.&#13;
Given the very confining controls on the ability of Eastern European&#13;
citizens freely to acquire exchange from other CPEs and the frequent ad hoc&#13;
adjustments introduced especially by the net exporters of tourist services, the&#13;
tourist exchange rates are not even approximately accurate reflections of&#13;
relative consumer prices in the various CPEs.     However, they may be indicative&#13;
of actual relative prices of a select group of consumer goods and services in&#13;
the benchmark period.&#13;
6. Joint Investment Exchange Rates&#13;
Capital movements within Eastern Europe are usually conducted in real&#13;
terms on a loan basis; repayment of principal and interest are also effected in&#13;
real terms. What matters in these transactions are the level of the interest&#13;
rates and the prices at which the reciprocal flows are effected. In some cases,&#13;
however, the CPEs have deemed it profitable to establish common organizations&#13;
either because no other form of exchange has proved to be acceptable,/30 other&#13;
forms are simply not possible (e.g., in operating common banks), or it has been&#13;
/29 This development is reported in Pachta 1980, p. 16 and Wesolowski, 1983,&#13;
p. 17, unfortunately without further details.&#13;
/30 As in the case of Haldex, which emerged from Hungary's lack of interest&#13;
in transferring a technology at the "free" price called for by the 1949&#13;
Sofia principles regarding the transfer of technology within the CMEA and&#13;
Poland's reluctance at the time to breach these principles openly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
deemed desirable to enhance regional economic cooperation through joint&#13;
organizations (e.g., Interatominstrument).&#13;
The creation of Haldex in 1959-1960, for which at least 60 exchange&#13;
rates were used in order to evaluate each partner's contribution, demonstrated&#13;
the complexity of arriving at a mutually satisfactory accounting for two CPE&#13;
partners.    In order   to  relax   this  tedious  procedure  and  to enhance   the&#13;
establishment of common organizations within the CMEA, the so-called Berlin&#13;
method for evaluating the costs of joint investment or construction cooperation&#13;
was worked out in 1964 and has been periodically revised since.&#13;
This method consists of disaggregating a project's total cost is local&#13;
currency into a wage component, a trade component, and a structure component.&#13;
For wages, premiums, and wage-related costs (such as social benefits) the&#13;
noncommercial exchange rates are proposed.      Goods and services acquired from&#13;
abroad specifically for the project are valued at their true transferable ruble&#13;
cost, while transactions in convertible currencies are translated into&#13;
transferable rubles at a realistic reproduction cost or IER.          The value of&#13;
building materials, machinery, and equipment is established by relating the&#13;
transferable ruble trade prices to domestic prices of the project's host country&#13;
for a large sample (50 to 60 percent) of the products consumed./31&#13;
With the establishment of the International Investment Bank (IIB) in&#13;
1971 and the policy aim stated in the Integration Program to find room for&#13;
economic and other regional organizations in order to foster socialist economic&#13;
integration, even the Berlin method as revised in 1972 proved to be too&#13;
cumbersome to facilitate the creation and exploitation of joint undertakings.&#13;
/31 Until 1972, a 60 percent sample had to be evaluated. Since 1973, only a&#13;
50 percent sample appears to be required. For sources and details, see&#13;
Brabant 1977, pp. 279-293.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
The CPEs therefore explored the setting of special intra-CMEA exchange rates for&#13;
the evaluation of common construction projects which would also help to promote&#13;
regional production cooperation and the operation of joint economic ventures.&#13;
Incidentally, the Integration Program signed in 1971 called for such exchange&#13;
rates--a special form of IER for domestic currency per unit of "socialist&#13;
currency" allocated to joint integration activities.&#13;
The first agreement on such special rates, endorsed in October 1973&#13;
(the so-called Karl-Marx-Stadt agreement),/32 was to become effective in January&#13;
1974 "in order to raise the role of [the CMEA countries'] currency and financial&#13;
relations, creating conditions for better determination of the efficacy of their&#13;
economic relations, specialization and industrial cooperation, improvement of&#13;
the mutual settlement of the accounts as well as possible introduction of the&#13;
convertibility of the collective currency ... and of their national currencies&#13;
in future time"./33    The rates listed in the last column of the top part of&#13;
Table 1 could be used, if the members so decided, to assure "equivalent&#13;
exchange".   Each member would notify the partners of a unilateral change in the&#13;
IER of up to 5 percent either way, preserving the central cross-rates with the&#13;
transferable ruble.     More substantial changes would have to be coordinated&#13;
multilaterally among the partners.&#13;
The  precise   provenance  of   these  rates  has  never   been  divulged&#13;
satisfactorily, and it is therefore risky to assess unambiguously what these&#13;
/32 An English translation of the purported agreements ("Rates or&#13;
coefficients of the national currencies with respect to the collective&#13;
currency [the transferable ruble] and among themselves") has been&#13;
available for some time. Follow-up agreements, however, are not.&#13;
/33 This is a verbatim quotation of part of the preamble of the English&#13;
translation, which is unfortunately very crude. It is not known who did&#13;
the translation and from which original, but it is said to be highly&#13;
reliable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
coefficients purport to measure and how realistic a guide they might be in&#13;
deciding upon the potential for rational joint investments.       However, for the&#13;
CPEs that are known to have operated around that time with commercial exchange&#13;
rates, overall reproduction coefficients, or IERs (including Czechoslovakia,&#13;
Hungary, Poland, and Romania), it is beyond doubt that their "joint investment&#13;
cooperation coefficient" coincides with the IER established mostly in the late&#13;
1960s.   While these coefficients may have reflected realistic average price&#13;
relations at the time they were computed, although that is not always beyond&#13;
reasonable doubt (see Section 2), they were already seriously out-of-date when&#13;
introduced  (e.g.,  in 1967-1968   in Czechoslovakia and Hungary).      They could&#13;
therefore not possibly adequately reflect current differences in trade and&#13;
domestic price levels and structures; even if these obstacles could have been&#13;
overcome, the pronounced adjustments in domestic and especially in trade prices&#13;
experienced since the mid-1970s quickly nullified whatever degree of realism&#13;
these rates may still have reflected in 1973.&#13;
It is therefore not surprising that these rates were never applied for&#13;
joint investment or production decisions.     The daily operations of some of the&#13;
international   organizations,   as  often   claimed   in  the   Eastern   European'&#13;
literature, might have been conducted partly on the basis of these rates.&#13;
However, since the field of operation of such organs has remained largely&#13;
confined to various plan coordination aspects, nearly all operational expenses&#13;
must have been incurred for wages and salaries, and the standard recommendation&#13;
to convert such expenditures at the noncommercial rate, which is far less&#13;
favorable in transferable rubles than the investment coefficient, has remained&#13;
valid.&#13;
In fact, the original coefficients were so out of line with reality&#13;
that soon after their introduction considerable pressure arose to modify them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
New coefficients were worked out in 1975, 1977, and 1981 for introduction in the&#13;
following year. Unfortunately, the precise magnitudes involved have not so far&#13;
been quoted. In any case, even the revised rates appear to have been applied to&#13;
a "relatively small number of cases so far" (VAlek 1981, p. 10), none of which&#13;
has been divulged in the specialized literature.&#13;
7.   Miscellaneous Other Exchange Rates&#13;
This category is really an outlet for a variety of exchange rates that&#13;
may be highly important to very specific operations but can hardly be indicative&#13;
of purchasing power parities or equilibrium exchange rates for all foreign&#13;
transactions.    They are   therefore only of parenthetical     interest,  and the&#13;
dicussion below will hence be very concise.&#13;
a. Black market exchange rate&#13;
This is especially important as a source of foreign exchange to&#13;
supplement the strictly limited amount of currency that can be acquired by&#13;
tourists.   Since there is no organized market, the rates fluctuate widely and&#13;
can hardly be indicative of overall economic conditions.&#13;
b. Private internal exchange rate&#13;
Especially important in foreign currency shops, where only coupons can&#13;
be used.   These shops usually provide goods not otherwise available at rates&#13;
that are more favorable than the official ones but are not quite as attractive&#13;
as those obtainable by convertible currency owners.&#13;
c. Special store exchange rates&#13;
Special purpose shops in the CPEs occasionally offer local products&#13;
available for local currency to holders of foreign currency at especially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
favorable  rates./34     However,  this  normally  applies   only  to  convertible&#13;
currencies.&#13;
d. Special purpose noncommercial exchange rates&#13;
Traveler checks emitted by the USSR's foreign trade bank fetch a&#13;
substantial premium over ruble or other Eastern European currencies.       In the&#13;
case of Poland, for example,/35 a ruble traveler check was recently quoted at&#13;
126.47 zlotych to the ruble as against 36 zlotych to the ruble for noncommercial&#13;
transactions./36    However,   these  traveler checks, and    by  implication  the&#13;
favorable exchange rate, do not appear to be generally accessible to Eastern&#13;
European citizens, even those of Poland and the USSR.&#13;
In the case of Poland, this rate is apparently a special one applicable&#13;
to traveler checks issued by VneXtorgbank for payment to Polish construction&#13;
workers in the Soviet Union, although traveler checks are obviously also issued&#13;
to Soviet citizens at the regular noncommercial rate./37     However, when Polish&#13;
citizens acquire traveler checks from Vnestorgbank, the rubles are in&#13;
compensation for work performed in the Soviet Union; the purchase of ruble&#13;
traveler checks for currency of another CPE is apparently proscribed.     In order&#13;
/34 In most cases, however, such goods would otherwise not be offered, and it&#13;
is therefore difficult to speculate about the exchange rate applied here.&#13;
/35 Admittedly the only country that publicly quotes such rates. It is not&#13;
known whether similar arrangements prevail in other CPEs.&#13;
/36 Incidentally, before the devaluation of January 1982 the traveler check&#13;
ruble fetched 49.502 zlotych as against 23.16 zZotych per noncommercial&#13;
transferable ruble.&#13;
/37 The Soviet Union appears to adhere rather closely to the central&#13;
noncommercial rates, while several other members have embraced a host of&#13;
ad hoc adjustments or, at least, they have availed themselves of the 10&#13;
or now 20 percent band.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
not to discourage construction crews from engaging in operations in the Soviet&#13;
Union, many of whom in the 1970s participated in building jobs in convertible&#13;
currency areas, the Polish government may have decided to set an "equivalent"&#13;
exchange rate that fluctuates more or less in tandem with dollar quotations.&#13;
Whether the Polish government is as a result subsidizing these ruble-earning&#13;
work crews or whether special transfers are enacted by the Soviet Union is not&#13;
known, but the former is more likely.&#13;
While apparently exceptional in itself, the preceding case is not&#13;
really unique but a symptom of a much more convoluted system of regulations&#13;
regarding the private exchange of currency that are actually in effect in&#13;
Eastern Europe. Persistent problems with shopping sprees; excessive demand for&#13;
tourist services, particularly in Hungary and the Balkan countries; problems&#13;
with offsetting noncommercial imbalances; and other such issues have contributed&#13;
to rendering any multilateral agreement about tourist exchange rates and&#13;
exchange limitations largely inoperative.&#13;
For a number of CPEs that have invested heavily in a modern tourist&#13;
infrastructure, tourism is really a "hard commodity" that should be traded only&#13;
against equivalent goods or convertible currency.        Further,  especially when&#13;
consumer markets are already strained as a result of production and import&#13;
constraints, consumer goods and services in general become even harder and the&#13;
authorities are therefore less likely to tolerate shopping sprees by residents&#13;
from  soft  currency  countries.    Instead of adhering    fully  to multilateral&#13;
agreements, several CPEs have fallen back upon the well-tried system of blateral&#13;
agreements also for noncommercial transactions over which they have direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
control, i.e., mainly, but not only, tourism./38 In spite of the fact that such&#13;
bilateralism is greatly inflexible, characterized as it is by cumbersome&#13;
negotiations and distorted economics of the relevant transactions, bilateral&#13;
agreements have proved to be a reliable means of controlling intra-CMEA payments&#13;
and receipts for tourist services and avoiding unexpected windfall losses.       If&#13;
in the end demand suddenly surges beyond the agreed upon limits, ad hoc target&#13;
restrictions on travel, including special taxes on the exchange of a particular&#13;
currency, passport duties, and other suchlike hindrances will in effect compress&#13;
"tourist demand"./39&#13;
Section 4:  EXCHANGE REGIME FOR CONVERTIBLE CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS&#13;
The exchange regime for convertible currencies, which are truly "hard&#13;
commodities" in Eastern Europe, is generally much less diversified than that for&#13;
intra-CMEA transferable ruble transactions. It is perhaps in the very nature of&#13;
clearing currencies to call for somewhat more complex regulations since, by&#13;
definition, they deny the existence of a number of foreign exchange problems and&#13;
/38 Even such bilateral agreements are not always adhered to, as was clearly&#13;
demonstrated by Romania's unilateral decision in the summer of 1980 that&#13;
gasoline purchased by residents of other CMEA members be paid for in&#13;
convertible currencies or be offset by special oil deliveries. Several&#13;
of the partners obliged not only to help out stranded tourists and save&#13;
the availability of tourist services at the height of the vacation&#13;
season, but also because, although exceptional in its publicity,&#13;
Romania's stance intrinsically did not differ from the overall precepts&#13;
that determine the framework for the formulation of tourist policies in&#13;
Eastern Europe.&#13;
/39 As illustrated in late 1981 in the case of Czechoslovak demand for&#13;
tourist forints, if the situation threatens to get out of hand, the&#13;
availability of tourist services is suppressed altogether (PrAca,&#13;
December 2, 1981, p. 2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
the absence of organized markets by necessity leads, at least implicitly, to a&#13;
wide range of "hard" and "soft" goods and services.&#13;
With respect to convertible currencies, it is useful to distinguish&#13;
among the official, the commercial, the tourist, the internal, the support, and&#13;
the travel exchange rates.    Each will be surveyed in sequence.     Since overall&#13;
exchange policies and general principles of exchange rate determination have&#13;
been discussed in the two preceding sections, the analysis here can be kept to&#13;
the strict minimum.&#13;
1. The Official Exchange Rate&#13;
The overall conditions governing the determination of official exchange&#13;
rates for convertible currencies parallel those observed in Section 3:        until&#13;
the gradual dissolution of the Bretton Woods system, the gold parity fixed in&#13;
the postwar period sets the dollar exchange rate (and by inference that of other&#13;
convertible currencies). The response of the CPEs to the dollar devaluations of&#13;
1971 and 1973, and the floating parity regime since has been unsynchronized and&#13;
mixed,  as  the data   in Table   2 show.     Generally  speaking,  most  countries&#13;
appreciated their currency after 1971 and 1973 in exact proportion to the&#13;
changed gold parity of convertible currencies, albeit in some cases with a&#13;
considerable lag, which at least for a while entailed a de facto devaluation.&#13;
Since then, some have largely held on to the 1973 rates (the German Democratic&#13;
Republic until 1979 and, by and large, Poland and Romania until 1977-1978);&#13;
others pegged their rate at first to that of the dollar, but have more recently&#13;
determined changes in the dollar exchange rate by reference to shifts in the&#13;
value of a basket of convertible currencies (between 9 and 13 reference&#13;
currencies are used).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
With the exception of the German Democratic Republic and Romania, all&#13;
CPE have in the past three to four years gradually switched over to frequent&#13;
(monthly, biweekly, and even weekly) exchange rate quotations for convertible&#13;
currencies in line with the evolving conditions in international financial&#13;
markets. The rates listed in Table 2 are for the most part simple averages of&#13;
the weighted monthly average quotations./40&#13;
As in the case of the official exchange rates of the CMEA currencies&#13;
against each other, the official rates against convertible currencies are&#13;
notional units without practical implications, except as noted for ruble-&#13;
denominated transactions (especially relevant in cases where no special tourist&#13;
exchange rates are enacted, as in the Soviet Union).       In most instances, each&#13;
CPE's official exchange rate, which by and large has remained measurably&#13;
overvalued against the dollar, applies only to the conversion of foreign trade&#13;
statistics into a uniform notional domestic currency and, by implication, the&#13;
price-equalization account; although in the case of the German Democratic&#13;
Republic and countries with proper IERs, even the price-equalization account has&#13;
been based on one or more different exchange rates.        In the past few years,&#13;
there has emerged a shift even in recording trade statistics.       First, Hungary&#13;
transformed its trade multipliers into official commercial rates in 1976 and&#13;
started recording trade statistics at those rates. Second, Romania followed the&#13;
/40 With the number of days for which the rates remained valid as weights.&#13;
This is not really the proper average because of the well-known fluctua-&#13;
tions in trade volume due to second and fourth quarter storming. In most&#13;
cases, however, no proper trade weights are available and it would there-&#13;
fore be rather useless to adopt further inconsistencies in an attempt to&#13;
correct the already inconsistent data-manipulating procedures. More&#13;
refined weighted average rates of some CPE currencies are published&#13;
regularly in Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, Nos. 3, 6, 9, and 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Hungarian example in 1981. Finally, with the devaluation of the zloty in 1982,&#13;
Poland switched its trade statistics over to the commercial quotations.          As&#13;
discussed, the trade multipliers implied a strong devaluation of the ruble&#13;
against the dollar. As a result, the transformation of the trade multipliers or&#13;
IERs into commercial rates did not preserve the cross-rate uniformity typical of&#13;
the official exchange rate regime.&#13;
A related issue, minor from an economic point of view but obviously to&#13;
be heeded in order to interpret correctly data furnished by a number of CMEA&#13;
institutions, is the convertible currency rate of the transferable ruble.&#13;
Initially, the transferable ruble was set equal to the Soviet valuta ruble.&#13;
While the relationship was not explicit, adjustments to dollar changes appear to&#13;
have been synchronized with those of the Soviet valuta ruble until about 1974.&#13;
With the generalized floating of convertible currencies, the transferable ruble&#13;
is said to have been quoted at the "factual" value of foreign currencies, but in&#13;
practice this amounted to little more than imitating Soviet monthly quota-&#13;
tions.   The latter were at first based on the dollar but from November 1977 on&#13;
the simple arithmetic average changes of 13 convertible currencies./41 Starting&#13;
with July 1978, but effectively introduced in IBEC's transactions only as of&#13;
January 1, 1979, IBEC started to adjust the value of the transferable ruble,&#13;
apparently on a monthly basis, in line with the weighted change in the value of&#13;
the basket of 13 currencies./42 Since the weights of these currencies in&#13;
/41  For further details, see Konstantinov 1982, p. 47.&#13;
/42  This is a summary of various accounts, none of which is unambiguous as to&#13;
the exact practices followed in IBEC's exchange quotations. For some&#13;
useful pointers, see Konstantinov 1982, pp. 124-128, Konstantinov 1983,&#13;
p. 24, and Mironjuk 1983, p. 8.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
"transferable ruble" transactions differ from those applicable to the USSR's&#13;
foreign trade, a possibly significant gap between the dollar value of the&#13;
transferable ruble and that of the Soviet ruble may emerge.       In January 1983,&#13;
for example, this amounted to a 4.72 percent depreciation of the transferable&#13;
ruble against the Soviet ruble.    This 3 to 5 percent deviation was typical for&#13;
the latter half of     1982 and  the first half of     1983.   It has since been&#13;
substantially narrowed (to 0.61 percent in September 1983).&#13;
2. The Commercial Exchange Rate&#13;
The observations pertaining to the commercial rates of convertible&#13;
currencies parallel those detailed under the same heading for the transferable&#13;
ruble regime.   That for the German Democratic Republic was explained there as a&#13;
peculiarly special case.     In view of the inherently more important role of&#13;
proper accounting in dollar transactions than for the inflexible transferable&#13;
ruble trade area and the role the economic reforms of the 1960s sought to allot&#13;
to  fostering  trade with   convertible  currency  partners,   the CPEs   generally&#13;
developed  IERs  for the   latter  type of   trade relations   earlier,  with more&#13;
circumspection,  and greater   flexibility/43   than has been the case for      the&#13;
transferable ruble.&#13;
Nonetheless, few of the Eastern European countries appear to have&#13;
succeeded in maintaining an up-to-date and accurate quotation of convertible&#13;
currencies in the sense of preserving a proper relationship between external and&#13;
local costs at least for actually traded goods and services. In view of the&#13;
substantial fluctuations in world prices and the much more muted target shifts&#13;
/43 For those that rely chiefly on multiple IERs by commodity group or trade&#13;
direction, even the average IER, as in the case of Czechoslovakia and for&#13;
a long time also in the case of Hungary, has not kept pace with&#13;
developments in relative prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
in domestic prices and price policies in most CPEs, it appears rather, far-&#13;
fetched to assume that the present commercial exchange rates, as listed in Table&#13;
3, even approximately reflect the equilibrium dollar exchange rate for traded&#13;
goods.   The Hungarian authorities, however, have followed an active exchange&#13;
rate policy since the mid-1970s in an attempt to offset on average the price&#13;
increases experienced in convertible currency trade.     The Hungarian commercial&#13;
exchange rates, especially those recently enacted, would therefore tend to&#13;
approach purchasing power, perhaps with an identical bias as that present in the&#13;
early 1970s.&#13;
3.   Tourist Exchange Rates&#13;
The substantial dichotomy between the tourist and other noncommercial&#13;
exchange regime in transferable ruble relations does not have an immediate&#13;
counterpart in convertible currency transactions.     Diplomatic expenditures and&#13;
remittances from abroad are normally converted either at the official rate or at&#13;
one pegged to the gold parity rate, as is the case for the exchange of converti-&#13;
ble currencies for unorganized tourist services./44     However, unlike the ruble&#13;
tourist exchange rates, there is much greater asymmetry in rates applicable to&#13;
convertible currencies for resident and nonresident tourists.&#13;
The need for differentiating between areas, where the exchange rate&#13;
performs only nominal functions from others where the exchange rate has a&#13;
bearing on allocatory decisions is particularly important in the policy adopted&#13;
/44  However, in the case of Czechoslovakia, diplomats can avail themselves of&#13;
the same rate as that applicable to private remittances from abroad.&#13;
this was less favorable than the tourist rate until 1973 (a premium of&#13;
100 percent as against 125 percent), but the relation has since been&#13;
reversed (a premium of 100 percent as against 75 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
with regard to the earning of convertible currency from tourism./45      Some CPEs&#13;
clearly wish to capitalize on their natural resources, and are therefore bent on&#13;
attracting tourists inter alia by declaring a favorable exchange rate, in&#13;
particular when earnings can be exchanged for "hard commodities" or convertible&#13;
currency. Other CPEs deliberately seek to limit contact with foreigners and are&#13;
therefore more likely to embrace all means, including overvalued exchange rates,&#13;
to discourage tourism.    Since there have been palpable changes in this policy&#13;
stance, tourist exchange rates have undergone fluctuations unrelated to shifts&#13;
in relative costs.&#13;
As with the transferable ruble regime, a sharp distinction should be&#13;
drawn between organized and unorganized     tourism.    A country that seeks to&#13;
promote tourism is likely to declare in fact a more favorable exchange rate in&#13;
the case of organized tourism than in the case of unorganized tourism or as&#13;
against the rates declared by countries that discourage tourism as a matter of&#13;
policy. The argument in the latter case is presumably that the gap between the&#13;
black market and official organized tourist rates needs to be bridged by&#13;
offering a positive premium to persuade tourist service customers to pay for&#13;
most of the local expenditures in convertible currencies directly to the state&#13;
banking system.&#13;
Regarding exchange rates in the case of unorganized tourism, the Soviet&#13;
Union does not differentiate between commerce and tourism since the 1961&#13;
currency revaluation cum monetary reform, the German Democratic Republic does&#13;
not at all differentiate, Bulgaria suspended the tourist premium between 1975&#13;
/45  The policy regarding the selling of convertible currency exchange to&#13;
residents in order to procure tourist goods and services abroad is, of&#13;
course, a different matter altogether, and this will be dealt with&#13;
separately below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
and 1978, and all other CPEs provide some kind of premium over the official&#13;
exchange rate.   As shown in Table 4, this premium can be very considerable--in&#13;
the case of Poland, for example, amounting to 10 times the basic official rate&#13;
until the devaluation of the z1oty in January 1982, when the premium over the&#13;
basic official rate was actually substantially increased.&#13;
Since the CPEs normally/46 specify premiums as a percentage of the&#13;
official exchange rate, fluctuations in the latter--as in the post-Bretton Woods&#13;
system--are reflected also in the tourist exchange rates.     It may therefore be&#13;
somewhat more convenient to focus on the tourist premiums than to tabulate exact&#13;
fluctuations in the exchange rate during the period of concern here.       Because&#13;
most magnitudes that one wishes to convert have an annual time dimension, Table&#13;
4 is a compromise: the table specifies time series of average tourist rates and&#13;
summarizes the premium rates in the footnotes.&#13;
4. The Travel Exchange Rate for Residents&#13;
Because most CPEs are chronically short of convertible currency&#13;
reserves, they seek to discourage the demand for such currencies by residents,&#13;
especially in the case of private trips abroad./47 In addition to discouraging&#13;
movements abroad of their nationals through a vast network of formal and&#13;
/46  When Romania revalued the leu against the dollar in 1978, the premium&#13;
rate of 12 was maintained until 1981, and the quotation of the tourist&#13;
rate as a percentage premium over the basic rate was suspended. This is&#13;
indicated in Table 4 as an implicit premium.&#13;
/47  The demand for foreign currency on the part of CPE diplomats and trade&#13;
representatives residing or traveling abroad is normally controlled by&#13;
volume (e.g., a daily subsistence allowance of x dollars or the&#13;
equivalent), and the precise exchange rate plays a role only as a&#13;
bookkeeping device in the parent organization concerned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
informal controls, including passport requirements and taxes, maximum allocation&#13;
of convertible currency during a given time period, and other suchlike&#13;
deterrants, CPEs normally allow residents to acquire convertible currency at a&#13;
vastly higher rate than either the official, commercial, or nonresident tourist&#13;
exchange rate.    Thus, in Czechoslovakia the resident travel rate equals the&#13;
official rate augmented with a 125 percent tax and 125 percent administrative&#13;
fee.   In Poland, the resident travel rate used to be the effective official&#13;
rate, which was six times the official gold parity rate, augmented with a 150&#13;
percent tax (e.g., while foreigners in the early 1970 acquired local currency at&#13;
the rate of 40 zZotych to the dollar, residents paid at least 60.)     In Romania,&#13;
convertible currency is normally available to residents, naturally within the&#13;
rather restrictive limitations on allocations, at twice the tourist rate for&#13;
foreign residents. Finally, since late 1981, Hungary is the only CPE that sells&#13;
a limited amount of convertible currency at the "commercial rate".&#13;
5. The Exchange Rate in Foreign Currency Shops&#13;
Especially during the 1970s, virtually all CPEs provided one outlet or&#13;
another for purchases in foreign currency or related vouchers by nonresidents&#13;
and sometimes by residents as well.     Such shops normally sell local but mostly&#13;
foreign food and other consumer goods at "duty free" prices.    In most instances,&#13;
the precise exchange rate adjustment is unknown because prices are fixed&#13;
directly in foreign currency or the prevailing special prices pertain only to&#13;
purchases against convertible currency or vouchers that are then converted at&#13;
the tourist exchange rate./48 Some countries, however, also apply a special&#13;
/48 However, Poland had a PKO premium until January 1, 1975 with a rate of 56&#13;
zZotych to the dollar.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
unannounced exchange rate that most tourists discover only by chance./49 It is&#13;
unfortunately impossible to tabulate those rates as they are not publicly&#13;
quoted.&#13;
6. Exchange Rates for Private Remittances&#13;
In order to encourage citizens to deposit their convertible currency&#13;
holdings and foreigners to send private gifts, some CPEs (including Poland, but&#13;
the phenomenon appears to be far more widespread) have made special exchange&#13;
facilities for private currency remittances, especially in the case of&#13;
pensioners. For a while in 1980-1981, Poland even offered special privileges to&#13;
private capital flows by foreign citizens of Polish origin.        It is not known&#13;
whether this policy is still in force at this time.&#13;
Usually, the exchange rate for such private remittances from abroad&#13;
when converted into local currency (as distinct from special vouchers) are&#13;
substantially more attractive than the official one, but as a rule less so than&#13;
the tourist rate for foreign residents.    But matters vary, as in the case of the&#13;
100 percent bonus in Czechoslovakia-also applicable to the exchange of currency&#13;
by duly accredited diplomats.    Similarly, Poland until 1978 had several special&#13;
rates  for  remittances  from  abroad:    social   security payments   to American&#13;
pensioners in Poland could be converted at 60 zrotych to the dollar until mid-&#13;
1975, when it was reduced to 45;/50 in February 1978, these special rater were&#13;
/49 For example, Cepelia shops in Poland, where goods can be bought also with&#13;
the domestic zloty, used to offer about twice the tourist rate if the&#13;
customer paid directly in convertible currency. Similarly, whenever a&#13;
western tourist offered $50 or more in any convertible currency to be&#13;
exchanged into zlotych, a premium of 15 zZotych per dollar or its&#13;
equivalent was offered.&#13;
/50 These rates were also applicable to diplomats.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
abolished and merged with the effective official rate (i.e.,, 10 times the "basic&#13;
rate").&#13;
7. Miscellaneous Rates&#13;
There are undoubtedly several other types of convertible currency&#13;
transactions that are expressed in local currency at exchange rates that differ&#13;
from any of the several enumerated here.       Three such rates will be briefly&#13;
mentioned.&#13;
a. East-west cooperation&#13;
In many east-west ventures case by case arrangements are made for the&#13;
transfer of currency in the two directions at special rates that may well be&#13;
only implicit in the agreement. Most of these cases are rather exceptional and&#13;
involve ad hoc rates, much like organized tourism.        They are therefore not&#13;
further discussed here.&#13;
b. Black currency markets&#13;
Of particular importance among the special rates are those observed in&#13;
black markets. The latter are especially volatile when regulations for private&#13;
visits to convertible currency countries are relaxed but the restrictions on&#13;
legal exchange limits remain tight; when the divergence between consumer&#13;
supplies in open retail markets and in secondary markets or in special currency&#13;
shops widens; when tensions in the country rise (as during a political crisis);&#13;
and other such extraordinary circumstances.      Such black market exchange rates&#13;
have in some cases been used to convert magnitudes in domestic currency.&#13;
However, it is felt that the very special nature of these rates cannot commend&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
them for conversions of any but a narrow demand for and supply of convertible&#13;
exchange at a given moment of time in a given market./51&#13;
c. Quotations in western markets&#13;
Although Eastern European currencies are not convertible, a few western&#13;
money markets, and indeed some specialized retail shops, trade in virtually all&#13;
CPE currencies.   The rates established here are similar to those prevailing in&#13;
black local markets with the proviso that the narrow supply of such currencies&#13;
is conditioned by the special circumstances under which Eastern European&#13;
citizens travel to convertible currency markets and the narrow demand by the&#13;
venturesomeness of mostly nonresident tourists who, with some risk, hope to take&#13;
advantage of exceptionally favorable rates.    Because of the rather narrow range&#13;
of potential transactions covered in such markets, these rates are not&#13;
indicative of general economic conditions.&#13;
Section 5: EXCHANGE RATES AND INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS&#13;
Even incomplete as it undoubtedly is, the preceding survey of the&#13;
bewildering variety of exchange rates with which the CPEs routinely attempt to&#13;
convert the value of foreign transactions into local currency equivalents has&#13;
clearly underlined a number of distinct features of the typical Eastern European&#13;
foreign exchange regime:    (i)   since the early postwar period, the CPEs have&#13;
adhered to a system of multiple exchange rates and no single relation is capable&#13;
of bridging the gap between foreign trade and domestic wholesale prices, except&#13;
/51 Such rates are periodically tabulated in Pick's currency yearbook (see,&#13;
for example, Steve 1981), but the exact provenance and therefore bearing&#13;
of these rates is a bit ambiguous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
for purely statistical purposes; (ii) each exchange rate is targeted at a&#13;
different type of foreign transactions; (iii) the efforts of the authorities to&#13;
set an "equilibrium rate" for selected activities are frequently encumbered with&#13;
other policy objectives; (iv) the variety of foreign economic transactions can&#13;
basically be segregated, although not nearly perfectly, because the policy&#13;
makers of CPEs have virtually full control over the entire foreign exchange&#13;
market; (v) for several types of transactions the corresponding exchange rates&#13;
are selected on the basis of a more or less realistic relationship between&#13;
actual domestic wholesale and foreign prices; and (vi) few CPEs make a serious&#13;
attempt to maintain a realistic relationship between domestic and foreign prices&#13;
of selected transactions on a nearly continuous basis, even if the one declared&#13;
at the start was intended to and did indeed reflect true proportions.&#13;
The multiplicity of exchange rates in the CPEs as documented in the&#13;
preceding sections is unquestionably a severe hindrance to arriving at proper&#13;
international comparisons of aggregate magnitudes expressed in local currency&#13;
units of these countries.      Because most exchange rates are     tailored   to a&#13;
specific type of transactions and are realistic only at or near the time when&#13;
they  become  effective,  the desired    kind  of  international  comparison,  the&#13;
countries involved, and its specific time reference are crucial in justifying&#13;
the selection of one declared exchange rate over another.&#13;
In the case of the conversion of macroeconomic aggregates, such as&#13;
national product or income in market prices, none of the exchange rates&#13;
investigated here really commends itself as a useful instrument to constructing&#13;
even crudely comparable magnitudes in US dollars. Short of repricing the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
macroeconomic data from the bottom up,/52 the only feasible quick solution is&#13;
the disaggregation of the relevant data into separate components for which&#13;
"proper" exchange rates can be found or can be constructed on the basis of&#13;
existing rates. The propriety of declared rates must be evaluated not only with&#13;
regard to the commodity and service type of transaction for which the rate was&#13;
created but also with reference to the policy aim(s) sought in the process and&#13;
the time dimension.    For example, for countries that attempt to encourage (or&#13;
discourage) tourism from convertible currency countries by setting especially&#13;
favorable (or unfavorable) conversion rates, the tourist exchange rate will not&#13;
be very helpful in attaining internationally comparable values even of a select&#13;
group of consumer goods and services.&#13;
For practical purposes, then, it might be instructive to disaggregate&#13;
macroeconomic data in the first instance into types of goods and services that&#13;
are known to belong to quite different price regimes, at the very least producer&#13;
goods and consumer goods.    Since most CPEs pursue various socioeconomic goals&#13;
through especially low prices for vital services (such as residential housing,&#13;
education, hospitals, and the like), even consumer goods should be disaggregated&#13;
into goods proper and services, and among the goods into foodstuffs and nonfood&#13;
consumer goods.    For producer goods,   it might be instructive to explore the&#13;
plausibility of converting national currency units by means of the dollar IER&#13;
with proper adjustments for shifts in the relative domestic wholesale and trade&#13;
prices since the reference base.     In other words, as a first approximation it&#13;
/52 There are various other ways by which international comparisons might be&#13;
undertaken. To the extent that they do not involve actual exchange&#13;
rates, these alternative computational techniques fall outside the&#13;
purview of this paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
could be assumed that the IER is appropriate for conversion in the base year; if&#13;
current values of other years have to be converted, the IER should first be&#13;
adjusted for the different behavior in time of domestic wholesale and trade&#13;
prices.   Alternatively, specific IERs for sectors, if known, could be utilized,&#13;
although such rates tend to be marred by all kinds of obstacles that inhibit&#13;
the CPEs from realizing a "normal" convertible currency price; such rates would&#13;
therefore impart a downward bias to the estimates that might be quite severe.&#13;
An alternative would be to convert industrial raw materials and investment goods&#13;
at a combined IER for ruble and dollar transactions, possibly also including the&#13;
intra-CMEA "joint cooperation coefficients".     For consumer goods,   it might be&#13;
instructive to adjust dollar-based IERs with the shifts in the intra-CMEA&#13;
noncommercial exchange rates as well as the tourist rates for convertible&#13;
currencies. In the case of consumer services there is not one single rate from&#13;
the multitude examined in this paper that would recommend itself.      Perhaps some&#13;
ad hoc transformations of other exchange rates, with the adjustment based on&#13;
estimations or informed guesses of the relationship between various types of&#13;
consumer prices, could usefully be explored.&#13;
The above recommendations remain intentionally vague because the&#13;
situation differs from country to country and from year to year.      Moreover, it&#13;
would be somewhat myopic to base a single estimate on only one set of&#13;
assumptions.   Since no system of acceptable exchange rates exists for any CPE,&#13;
including Hungary until very recently, estimates will by definition be highly&#13;
dependent on the specific assumptions the researcher necessarily has to specify&#13;
in order to arrive at magnitudes      in a comparable currency unit.      It would&#13;
therefore be advisable to prepare alternative estimates on the basis of explicit&#13;
assumptions.&#13;

/a At a 70 percent premium over the dollar exchange rate which was reduced on November 1, 1974&#13;
to 23.7 percent and abolished on November 1, 1975.  A new premium of 50 percent was&#13;
introduced on June 13, 1978 and revised to 80 percent on January 1, 1983.    /b At a 125&#13;
percent premium until 1973. As of January 1, 1974, the premium was revised to 75 percent.&#13;
/c No special tourist rate. However, such rates are normally quoted at parity with the&#13;
deutsche Mark. The rates listed here are the average quarterly exchange rates of the&#13;
deutsche Mark to dollar as quoted in International Financial Statistics.    /d  The tourist&#13;
forint was set at double the value of the conmercial forint until February 15, 1979 when it&#13;
was reduced to 1.75. Beginning in 1980 the gap was gradually reduced and eliminated&#13;
altogether as of October 1, 1981.    /e  Basically 10 times the "basic rate", which is the&#13;
gold parity quoted until the end of 1981.    /f A premium of 200 percent was in effect until&#13;
December 28, 1971, when it was reduced implicitly to 189.30 percent. It was further curbed&#13;
on October 2, 1974 to 141.45 percent, on March 6, 1978 to 168.46 percent, and on February 16,&#13;
1981 to 146.09 percent, and on December 29, 1982 to 179.64 percent.        No tourist exchange&#13;
rates. Rates listed here are identical with the official gold rates. r/h January - June.&#13;

            Exchange rates in Eastern Europe : types,
            derivation, and application
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The purpose of the paper is to explain
            the policy goals underlying the multiple exchange rate
            regime of centrally planned economies (CPEs), to clarify the
            origin and application of the various exchange rates that
            have been in use in seven of the European CPEs, to set up
            time series of the most important ones, and to evaluate
            whether any of these official rates could be used to
            translate official macroeconomic aggregates of these
            countries into US dollars. Because the multiple exchange
            regimes for the transferable ruble and convertible currency
            trade areas of these countries differ markedly, the paper
            discusses separately the origin, application significance,
            and variety of exchange rates used in each type of
            transaction. It concludes that none of the rates can be
            applied for a direct conversion of macroeconomic magnitudes
            in domestic currency into US dollars. However, some of the
            rates could be applied to various components of the
            macroeconomic magnitudes.
