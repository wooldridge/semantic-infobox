was not available, the discussion revealed that the revenue                               were relevant to this study, and it produced some broadly&#13;

seen by an interagency task group. The range of studies                            from elsewhere would be evaluated and lessons drawn&#13;
and implementation steps recommended would include                                 for developing an approach which suits Indonesian&#13;

b. Evaluating a transfer of responsibilities from B(B)                             would be integrated into this piloting study. Important&#13;
   WSs to PJTs: In the PJT I and PJT II areas, following                           good practicesâ&#128;&#148;such as performance benchmarking and&#13;

   river basins would be assessed and transitional arrange-                        the pilot.&#13;

   whether the PJT approach or another (for example,                               Regionalizing and Competitively Providing&#13;
   BLU) is more appropriate for the Indonesian situation.                          River Operations&#13;

   in PJTs would be evaluated, including how this is done                          tion services for the separate river basins managed by&#13;
   elsewhere.                                                                      PJTs could be implemented immediately and extended as&#13;
