L. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Cote d'lvoire is one of the principal countries in the CFA zone, with a population of about&#13;
13.5 million and a GDP of US$6.7 billion in 1994. High population growth and the deep recession&#13;
of the 1986-1993 period have resulted in a steady fall of living standards. GNP per capita in 1994&#13;
was estimated at about US$525 compared to well over US$1,000 in the early 1980s. Following&#13;
the devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994, the economic decline has been reversed and the&#13;
Government is now attempting to accelerate economic growth through the implementation of a&#13;
stabilization program and of structural reforns as well as through the promotion of investment&#13;
projects, including the proposed Private Sector Energy project.&#13;
1.2   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was prepared in the wake of the devaluation&#13;
and discussed by the Board in June 1994. The CAS supports the Government's objectives of&#13;
increasing real GDP growth and strengthening extemal and internal competitiveness, as formulated&#13;
in last year's PFP and its recent update covering the 1995-97 period which has been circulated to&#13;
the Board in April 1995. Major priorities in the FY95-97 CAS are to help the Govermment: (i)&#13;
maintain macroeconomic stability and strengthen public sector finances through reforms in both&#13;
revenue and expenditure, (ii) promote private sector development through continued liberalization&#13;
of trade, financial and labor markets, and through investments in productive activities, including&#13;
energy, (iii) increase the effectiveness of the human resources development progran through&#13;
increased focus on primary health care, AIDS, basic education, and population policy, (iv)&#13;
strengthen institutional capacity through existing IDA-supported technical assistance programs,&#13;
and (v) intensify environmental work through projects and the National Environment Action Plan&#13;
(NEAP) process.&#13;
1.3   The assistance strategy is being implemented through (i) active portfolio management,&#13;
involving enhanced project supervision and elimination of undisbursed IBRD balances, (ii) an&#13;
intensified policy dialogue on macroeconomic, sector-specific, social, and environmental issues,&#13;
(iii) adjustment lending in support of policy reforms in agriculture, transport, private sector&#13;
development, and finance, and (iv) a reactivation of the project pipeline. The proposed Private&#13;
Sector Energy project is an integral part of this effort.&#13;
1.4   The proposed project aims to continue C6te d'Ivoire's process of reform in the energy&#13;
sector which was initiated under the Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (ESAL) (Loan 3150-IVC) in&#13;
1989/90 . The ESAL made a significant contribution in improving efficiency in the energy sector&#13;
as well as in promoting private sector participation through the privatization of the management of&#13;
the electricity production, transport, and distribution. The proposed project continues this effort to&#13;
stiengthen private sector development in this sector through the financing of Phase II of the&#13;
privately owned and operated power plant developed under a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer&#13;
(BOOT) arrangement. The proposed project has been closely coordinated and prepared with the&#13;
IFC which is cofinancing Phase I of the power plant.&#13;
H. MACROECONOMIC SE1TING&#13;
2.1    Medium  Term  Strategy.  Following the CFA franc devaluation, the Government&#13;
reformulated its economic and social program and spelled out its new stabilization and structural&#13;
adjustment program in a Policy Framework Paper (PFP) which has been updated to cover the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
1995-97 period. The PFP aims at: (i) increasing real GDP growth to annual rates in excess of 6.5&#13;
percent, beginning in 1995 (Annex 2-1), (ii) generating sustained and increasing primary budget&#13;
surpluses, (iii) increasing public sector efficiency through institutional reforms and an acceleration&#13;
of the privatization program, (iv) strengthening external competitiveness through trade, price, and&#13;
regulatory reforms, and (v) intensifying human resource development and increasing efforts to&#13;
alleviate poverty. These objectives have been translated into a comprehensive reform program&#13;
ranging from policy actions in the fiscal, trade, and price areas to reforms that stimulate private&#13;
sector development and improve the delivery of basic social services.&#13;
2.2    Deepening public sector reform is a central element of the strategy, involving reduction&#13;
and streamlining of the civil service, institutional capacity building and public enterprise&#13;
divestiture. Inter alia, this will involve strengthening certain ministerial capacities, improving the&#13;
management of domestic budgeting and the external public debt, accelerating the privatization&#13;
process, creating a legal framework compatible with dynamic private sector development (as&#13;
business confidence is presently undermined by outdated laws and shortcomings in the judiciary&#13;
system). The Government has selected 42 enterprises for privatization during the 1994-1996&#13;
period. For monopolistic enterprises, the privatization process will include the adoption of a clear&#13;
and transparent regulatory framework defining the conditions under which they will operate'.&#13;
2.3    In addition to the rehabilitation effort, important steps were taken in 1994 toward&#13;
liberalizing the economy and reducing the role of the public sector. The Government dismantled&#13;
some non-tariff barriers, adopted a new labor code which liberalized hiring and firing procedures,&#13;
privatized several enterprises, and started restructuring several public enterprises in the agricultural&#13;
and transportation sectors.&#13;
2.4    Economic Trends in 1994. Preliminary results for 1994 suggest that with the parity&#13;
change and the implementation of the accompanying fiscal, monetary, and structural adjustment&#13;
policies, the Ivorian economy has been able to strengthen its international competitiveness and&#13;
restore economic growth. Real GDP growth was 1.7 percent in 1994 versus -0.8 percent in 1993.&#13;
The Government succeeded in reducing inflation to pre-devaluation levels within 8 months&#13;
following the parity change. During the last quarter of 1994 the monthly inflation rate was 0.3&#13;
percent. This was largely achieved by a restrictive monetary and fiscal policy. In this context,&#13;
fiscal policy has been the cornerstone of the stabilization program. The Government met its&#13;
revenue and expenditure targets throughout 1994 and generated its first primary balance surplus in&#13;
the 1990s. Expenditures were tightly controlled by increasing base wages on average only by 10&#13;
percent, thereby reducing the Government's wage bill from almost 13 percent of GDP in 1993 to&#13;
9.5 percent of GDP in 1994. The same policy stance was adopted by the private sector. The&#13;
Government also unblocked on schedule the three-month price freeze on 34 products it had enacted&#13;
immediately following the devaluation and adjusted utility tariffs, including water (15 percent),&#13;
electricity (20 percent), and public transport (40 percent).&#13;
These provisions reflect forthcoming developments in the power sector. While EECI is not yet on&#13;
the privatization agenda, this is an option to be examined in the power sector institutional study to be&#13;
funded under the proposed project. This study will also include proposals for improving power&#13;
sector regulation, insofar as some aspects of the supply system will require a regulatory framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

m. ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
3.1    Total energy consumption in 1990 amounts to 3.2 million tons oil equivalent (TOE)&#13;
(Annex 3-1). The main sources of energy are biomass, hydrocarbons, and hydroelectric power.&#13;
Abundant forestry reserves have traditionally been the major source of energy (over two-thirds of&#13;
total energy consumption), but intensive exploitation and land clearing are threatening both the&#13;
sustainability of fuelwood supply and the environment.&#13;
3.2    Fuelwood and charcoal supply originates mainly from land clearance for agriculture, at&#13;
the expense of rapidly diminishing forestry reserves, now reduced to about 8 million hectares.&#13;
Clearing is expected to continue at a rate of at least 250,000 bectares per year, compared to&#13;
replanting of only 5,000 hectares. The widespread and growing use of charcoal as a fuel and the&#13;
low conversion efficiency of wood into charcoal (only 12 percent of the primary energy is&#13;
conserved in the final product) accounts for a large indirect demand for fuelwood. There is a risk&#13;
of fuelwood shortages in the not-too-distant future, and, more importantly, the concomitant risk of&#13;
irreversible damage to the environment, unless more efficient ways of producing, replenishing and&#13;
using fuelwood are widely introduced and household consumers switch to alternative fuels such as&#13;
butane and kerosene.&#13;
3.3    Exploration for hydrocarbons commenced onshore in the 1950s but failed to identify&#13;
significant hydrocarbon deposits there. Since 1971, exploration focused on the offshore basin,&#13;
initially conducted by major companies such as Exxon, Shell and Phillips, then by the national&#13;
company PETROCI and small independcnts like United Meridian of the USA. The early efforts&#13;
resulted in the discovery of several significant oil and gas accumulations: Exxon found the Belier&#13;
oil field in 1974; and Phillips discovered in 1979 the Espoir oil field and several oil and gas&#13;
structures including Foxtrot, Lion and Panthere. Belier and Espoir were developed and exploited,&#13;
but abandoned recently due to either depletion or high operational cost.  In 1989, Phillips&#13;
relinquished all their acreage and termiinated their activities in C6te d'lvoire due to the lack of a&#13;
remunerative market for gas. Since 1990, the Government, with the help of the Bank, the Japanese&#13;
Government and the African Development Bank has successfully revived the interest of foreign&#13;
investors in the hydrocarbon sector, amended the fiscal and contractual terms to provide more&#13;
incentive for exploration and development of oil and gas resources, and carried out two exploration&#13;
promotion campaigns. These efforts resulted in the conclusion of several Production Sharing&#13;
Contracts (PSC), with the private sector, for the exploration and development of hydrocarbon&#13;
resources. Two PSCs were signed with a group of investors represented by United Meridian Co.&#13;
(UMC)) of USA, for the offshore blocks Cl-l I (Lion and Panthere fields), Cl- I and CI-2. Another&#13;
PSC was concluded with another group of investors represented by Apache of USA for the&#13;
offshore block CI-27.  The latter agreement replaced the Convention Generale concluded&#13;
previously with the same group for the development of the Foxtrot field. (Map IBRD 26927 shows&#13;
the location of the different concessions and hydrocarbon fields).&#13;
3.4    Petroleum products are supplied from an efficient modern refinery - "Socite ivoirienne&#13;
de Raffinage "-SIR (3 million tons per year capacity) owned by the Ivorian subsidiaries of seven&#13;
international petroleum companies and the Governments of C6te d'lvoire and Burkina Faso. The&#13;
refinery is located at Vridi near Abidjan and in addition to supplying the Ivorian market, exports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
significant quantities of petroleum products within the West African region. The refinery produces&#13;
about 22,000 tons of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) per annum. Its utilization is concentrated in&#13;
urban areas. The stagnation of utilization is mainly due to supply and marketing constraints. The&#13;
proposed project includes preparation of a program for developing the LPG market.&#13;
3.5    About 25 percent of the population has access to electricity. Supply of electricity is&#13;
provided by a combination of hydro and thermal facilities. Total system capacity is about 918&#13;
MW (Annex 3-2). The hydroelectric system, with 604 MW, represents two-thirds of the installed&#13;
capacity. The Kossou hydroelectric plant, designed as a multi-annual storage reservoir, has never&#13;
functioned anywhere near its design capacity, because the reservoir has never filled up since its&#13;
construction in 1972. The hydro-electric production potential is highly variable from year to year,&#13;
depending mainly upon rainfall. CMte d'lvoire also possesses a thermal power plant located in Vridi&#13;
on the outskirts of Abidjan . This plant has an installed capacity of 314 MW, but due to&#13;
inadequate maintenance over the years, operates at much below capacity. CMte d'Ivoire has been&#13;
purchasing electricity from Ghana; however, growing Ghanaian demand and the need to&#13;
rehabilitate its hydro system have curtailed exports to CMte d'Ivoire. Ghana now imports some of&#13;
its electricity needs from CMte d'Ivoire. With the improving macro-economic climate in C6te&#13;
d'lvoire, domestic demand for electricity is expected to resume the growth recently interrupted by&#13;
several years of recession. These developments mean that new generation capacity is urgently&#13;
needed. (Further analysis of electricity supply and demand is in Chapter VI).&#13;
B.    Energy Sector Reform and the Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (ESAL)&#13;
3.6    Before the ESAL was implemented in 1989, electricity and petroleum supply were in the&#13;
public sector, with little private sector investment. Until the late 1970's, energy sector performance&#13;
was satisfactory; however, the heavy public sector investment progran triggered by the coffee and&#13;
cocoa boom did not leave the energy sector untouched. The public sector electric utility "Energie&#13;
Electrique de C6te d'Ivoire" (EECI) launched an investment program of questionable economic&#13;
justification, which ultimately jeopardized the very existence of the company. In 1975, the&#13;
Government created a national petroleum company (PETROCI) and at about the same time&#13;
induced the petroleum distribution companies to build, and subsequently expand, the SIR refinery&#13;
(in which the Government holds 45 percent). The Government took fifty percent share holding in&#13;
two private petroleum product distribution companies, and a public sector petroleum product&#13;
storage company (GESTOCI) was created, as was a bitumen company (SMB).&#13;
3.7    The debt service associated with this public investment program and the inefficiency of&#13;
public sector management substantially increased the fixed costs of supplying energy. Thus, by the&#13;
time the ESAL was under preparation in 1989, the prices of electricity had risen to an average of&#13;
US$0.18/kWh and gasoline to over US$4.50 per US gallon (at the exchange rate of the day).&#13;
Nonetheless, EECI was unable to maintain a positive cashflow and built up very substantial&#13;
arrears. By the time the sector was reorganized (Section C below), arrears had reached over one-&#13;
fifth of the country's total internal arrears, placing the country's fiscal position at risk. At the&#13;
same time, international oil prices were declining. Therefore international petroleum companies lost&#13;
interest in marginal exploration territories such as CMte d'Ivoire, and private investment in the&#13;
country's energy sector declined to zero.&#13;
3.8   In 1988, the Government undertook a reform of the energy sector, supported by the Bank&#13;
in the form of the ESAL, presented to the Board in December 1989. In the hydrocarbons subsector,&#13;
the program sought to redefine and refocus the role of PETROCI, promote the hydrocarbon&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
potential of Cote d'Ivoire to the international petroleum industry to encourage investment in&#13;
petroleum exploration, and rationalize petroleum product pricing and taxation. The Project&#13;
Completion Report of this operation (Report No. P-5165-RCI) indicates that the program was&#13;
largely successful in these areas. Subsidies have been removed from petroleum product prices and&#13;
taxation was rationalized; however, product price changes are not systematically linked to&#13;
international price movements.&#13;
C.    Power Sector Reform&#13;
3.9   It was in the electricity subsector that the Government undertook the most far-reaching&#13;
reforms. At the time the program was implemented in 1990, EECI was effectively insolvent (losses&#13;
for this year alone amounted to more than US$240 million). Rather than undertaking a financial&#13;
restructuring, the Government decided to privatize management of the power sector. In November&#13;
1990, with the assistance of the Bank, the Government negotiated and signed a Concession&#13;
Agreement with a group of two foreign companies, transferring operation and regular maintenance&#13;
of the power system to the "Compagnie Ivoirienne d'Electrcit " (CIE), which pays a leasing fee&#13;
to the Government for its use, while leaving in the hands of EECI the sector's assets, stewardship&#13;
over system expansion and renovation and supervision of the concession agreement between GOCI&#13;
and CIE. The tariff to the consumer was brought down by about 10 percent, but recently increased&#13;
as a result of the January 1994 devaluation. It now averages 57.3 CFA franc per kWh (or&#13;
US$0. 106/kWh at the current exchange rate).&#13;
3.10   Building upon this first success with private sector participation, the Government invited&#13;
the private sector to build, own and operate a new power plant, which is being done by CIPREL, a&#13;
consortium owned largely by Bouygues and "Electricite de France" (EDF). The CIPREL facility&#13;
is being built in two phases: as provided for in the agreement between GOCI and CIPREL, Phase I&#13;
(the first 99 MW) was financed by the private sector, while Phase 11 is to be financed by public&#13;
funds. The proposed project supports the Phase II development under the GOCI/CIPREL&#13;
agreement. CIPREL assumes responsibility for the commissioning date of Phase I and plant&#13;
availability for the whole facility (about 165 MW total capacity operating at a minimum&#13;
availability factor of 77 percent), while CIE (through FNEE) undertakes to buy energy at a&#13;
minirnum load factor of 77 percent, the amount depending upon the installed capacity. Phase I&#13;
was conmmissioned on schedule in March 1995.&#13;
3.11   Given the need to re-establish the power sector's financial equilibrium and the presence of&#13;
new corporate entities in the industry, the Government has created a new financial mechanism, the&#13;
"Fonds National de l'Energie Electnique" (FNEE), lodged within the "Caisse Autonome&#13;
d'Amortissement" (CAA), for better tracking and managing the flow of funds through the power&#13;
sector. The present structure of the power sector and the relationships between the various entities&#13;
is shown in Annex 3-3.&#13;
D.    Current Issues of Power Sector Reform&#13;
3.12   Largely on account of the structural transition occurring in the sector, it has become&#13;
imnportant to review and refine the allocation of certain power sector responsibilities, in order to&#13;
assure an orderly and efficient future development of the power system. The experience of the past&#13;
several years has indicated that the following five subject areas deserve further attention:&#13;
(a)    Responsibility for and implementation of system planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
(b)    Responsibility for and implementation of renewal/rehabilitation&#13;
(c)    basis of tariff setting and mechanism for tariff adjustment&#13;
(d)    Financial regulation of debt service and consumption arrears&#13;
(e)    Functional responsibilities and competition policy&#13;
System Planning&#13;
3.13   There does not appear to be an institutional focal point adequately equipped to carry on&#13;
system planning, and assure on-going coherence between the investment programs in generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution. Furthermore, the very role of public sector system planning needs to&#13;
be re-conceptualized in the context of a system with private sector participation. System planning&#13;
will most likely remain a necessary public sector function, both to help identify requirements for&#13;
which the Governnent will seek and negotiate private sector support, and to indicate those areas of&#13;
complementary investment in which the public sector may have to participate. Hence the issues&#13;
which need to be resolved in this area are as follows:&#13;
-  What is the role of system planning in a market-oriented private sector "IPP"&#13;
environment?&#13;
-  Should the three planning functions (generation, transmission, distribution) be&#13;
allocated to one institution, and if so, to which one? If not, how will coherence of&#13;
system planning be assured?&#13;
e All three areas of system planning need technical strengthening.&#13;
These matters will be addressed in the institutional arrangements study (para 4.13 (a)(i)).&#13;
Renewal and Rehabilitation:&#13;
3.14   As operator of the power system, CIE is not responsible for major maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation. This remains the responsibility of EECI. As system operator, CUE notifies EECI of&#13;
actual or impending problems involving maintenance and rehabilitation beyond the terms of CIE's&#13;
concession, whereupon EECI is supposed to remedy these difficulties. In practice, CIE has been&#13;
undertaking rehabilitation, according to two supplements to the agreement between CIE and the&#13;
Government (supplements "A and B')2  Supplement "A" is financed through a fee which CE&#13;
levies at source through the tariff. Supplement 'B"is supposed to be financed through FNEE, but&#13;
the sector is not generating enough net cash flow through FNEE to support this work.3 It would&#13;
appear that the split of responsibility between EECI and CIE, while clear in principle, in practice&#13;
has been recast for reasons of expediency. Hence the key issues which need resolution in this area&#13;
are:&#13;
2   The supplements are available from the project fle.&#13;
3 Part of the problem is due to arrears on Govermnent's electricity bills, discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
*      Which entity should be responsible for major maintenance and rehabilitation, the&#13;
private sector operator, or the public utility? If not the private sector operator,&#13;
how will this responsibility be addressed effectively?&#13;
*      How should this work be financed?&#13;
These questions will be addressed in the Institutional Arrangements study (para 4.13(a)(i)).&#13;
Tariffs: Basis and Adjustment Procedures&#13;
3.15   The present level of tariffs in Cote d'Ivoire appears reasonable, however, three tariff&#13;
matters deserves review for the future: (i) the level of the tariff, (ii) the tariff structure, and (iii) the&#13;
tariff adjustment mechanism. Regarding the level, at US$0.106/kWh, the Cote d'Ivoire electricity&#13;
tariff is in the higher range of international retail electricity prices. GOCI would like to reduce the&#13;
tariff if the introduction of natural gas-based energy supply made this feasible. A key factor&#13;
affecting future tariff requirements are the incremental expenditures on transmission and&#13;
distribution (T&amp;D). In countries at C6te d'Ivoire's level of electricity market penetration, the cost&#13;
of T&amp;D can exceed the cost of generation. Available data indicates that this is indeed likely to be&#13;
the case in Cote d'Ivoire. Hence the grid extension program, the technical standards adopted and&#13;
implementation arrangements will add to Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) and contribute to&#13;
tariff requirements, making it necessary to review and integrate the investment program for these&#13;
items in the tariff setting process. Also germaine to the tariff setting process is the structure of the&#13;
tariff - that is the prices charged to each customer class, and the shaping of the tariff within these&#13;
classes. These matters have not been reviewed for quite some time in C6te d'Ivoire, hence the&#13;
economic appropriateness of the price signals going to the consumers is not self-evident, and&#13;
deserves review.&#13;
3.16   There is not a regular, systematic process in place for reviewing and adjusting the&#13;
electricity tariff. The latest tariff change after the devaluation was prepared by "the Direction et&#13;
Controle des Grands Travaux" (DCGTx)4 and agreed between the Ministries of Mines and&#13;
Energy, Industry and Commerce and the Finance and Planning Ministry (on behalf of the Prime&#13;
Minister's office). It consisted of a devaluation adjustment based on the pre-existing structure.5 To&#13;
some extent, tariff adjustment "looks after itself' through the contracts entered into between the&#13;
State and the private sector operator. The private sector insures that its services are adequately&#13;
remunerated, and the State enables it to collect these revenues from customers. However, because&#13;
these contracts do not cover all of the aspects of electricity supply which incur costs, the&#13;
contractual mechanism is not a sufficient approach for tariff setting. The FNEE has been&#13;
established recently as a mechanism for assuring the financial equilibrium of the sector, but it is&#13;
not authorized to set tariffs. Furthermore, its structure is embryonic. It consists of a designated&#13;
group of officials which meets periodically, but has no supporting secretariat to co-ordinate and&#13;
follow-up on the work of the delegates. This arrangement will be examined in the proposed&#13;
institutional study under the project.&#13;
4   DCGTx is the Government arm exercising control on the investment projects.&#13;
Given the already high level of tariffs, the increase was less than proportionate to the devaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
3.17 These considerations suggest that the following tariff issues deserve attention:&#13;
*      The level and the structure of the tariff should be reviewed for (i) their adequacy&#13;
to satisfy financial performance criteria and (ii) their economic efficiency.&#13;
*      Appropriate institutional arrangements for adjusting tariffs remain to be&#13;
developed. The tariff adjustment process should be timely, transparent, systematic&#13;
and technically based.&#13;
A tariff study is proposed under the Power System Investment study (para 4.13(a)(ii)) to&#13;
address these matters. Pending completion of this study, the Government is committed to&#13;
introduce a formula which adjusts the current tariff so as to meet satisfactory financial&#13;
performance criteria. The proposed tariff formula and implementation are discussed in&#13;
Chapter V (para 5.8).&#13;
Financial Regulation of Debt Service and Consumption Arrears&#13;
3.18   Before the devaluation, relevant power sector institutions knew what was the initial debt&#13;
contracted with each creditor. Since these loans were contracted, there have been cancellations, re-&#13;
schedulings and early pay-outs. With devaluation, the sector's total obligations have been packaged&#13;
and rescheduled. This is handled by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), and the power&#13;
sector does not have a clear picture of the debt being serviced on its behalf. For purposes of&#13;
assessing the financial adequacy of the tariff, it would be essential to re-construct a comprehensive&#13;
debt service schedule by creditor under existing debt-service and "on-lending" arrangements.&#13;
3.19   The financial equilibrium of the sector is impaired by the accumulation of Governmental&#13;
arrears for its own electricity consumption. Annual Governmental consumption amounts to about&#13;
CFA franc 12 billion (US$22 million), and the estimate of the unpaid balance in December 1994&#13;
was CFA franc 32 billion (US$59 million) or 2.7 years' worth of Governmental consumption. With&#13;
1994 sales revenue at about US$215 million, annual Government consumption is about 10 percent&#13;
of the total and Government accumulated arrears amount to about 27 percent of one years' sales.&#13;
The Government has been '"vorking down" these gross outstandings by paying contributions to&#13;
debt service directly to the CAA. However, this is a situation which, for both financial and&#13;
economic reasons, cannot be allowed to persist. At present, the Treasury is responsible for paying&#13;
all of the Government's electricity bills, after the bills have been verified. This approach is not&#13;
conducive to adequate discipline over electricity use at the point of consumption.&#13;
3.20   The following issues need to be addressed in order to rectify the Governmental role in the&#13;
financial status of the power sector:&#13;
*      An up-to-date, detailed debt service schedule by creditor needs to be compiled, and&#13;
a commercially-based "charge-back" to the power sector determined. This will be&#13;
addressed in the tariff study.&#13;
*      A plan is needed for capping the amount of Governmental arrears on electricity&#13;
consumption, and settling it and a system is needed to insure that no further&#13;
arrears will accumulate on Governmental consumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
These matters will also be addressed in the tariff and institutional arrangement studies.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached that CAA will prepare a detailed schedule for&#13;
the sector debts no later than February 1, 1996 and that Government arrears to the sector&#13;
will be settled by June 30, 1996.&#13;
Functional Responsibilities and Competition Policy&#13;
3.21   While EECI is titularly the "maitre d'oeuvre" and "maltre d'ouvrage6" of the power&#13;
sector, in practice its role is more limited. For example, (i) the Government has assumed ownership&#13;
of the sector's productive assets; (ii) DCGTx has a major role in system planning, contracting and&#13;
implementation, (iii) the FNEE is in charge of the sector's financial equilibrium, and (iv) the&#13;
Ministry of Mining and Energy has a role in supervision of the sector. Nonetheless, EECI has a&#13;
staff of about 180 people and a current budget projection in the range of US$5.5 million. The&#13;
company has a core of well-qualified technical staff who know the sector and have considerable&#13;
expertise to contribute. However, as a corporate group, its functional pre-eminence in the power&#13;
system has been eclipsed due to problems of corporate performance which the new structures have&#13;
been created to resolve. Today, EECI's work is complementary rather than competitive with CIE:&#13;
it undertakes transmission and distribution project planning and implementation (some of which is&#13;
done in-house, some contracted out). While it is responsible for renovation of the power system, a&#13;
good part of this work has been contracted to CIE .&#13;
3.22   EECI, an entity of considerable prominence within the political hierarchy of the country,&#13;
will have to re-define its role in the context of a restructured power system. While some&#13;
"unbundling" of power generation from transmission and distribution is necessary to the&#13;
introduction of competition and private sector participation, it carries special transitional problems&#13;
for the incumbent and the system as a whole, such as moving from control to collaboration, and&#13;
adapting from a supplier-oriented to a customer-oriented market mentality. The company faces a&#13;
difficult challenge to make this transition, and it is a concern of GOCI and lenders to the power&#13;
sector.&#13;
3.23   The present system structure is not competitive. It is a set of complementary institutions,&#13;
which need to be well co-ordinated so as to minimize overlapping control and responsibility, while&#13;
insuring that important matters which need co-operation do not "slip between the cracks". To some&#13;
notable extent, this is being achieved on certain project initiatives by teamwork between the&#13;
relevant parties - for example the CIPREL project was conceived and negotiated on the Cote&#13;
d'Ivoire side by a working-level team of staff from the Ministry of Energy, EECI and DCGTx,&#13;
reporting to the Minister of Mines and Energy. The same team structure is now handling Phase II&#13;
of the project. Important to the longer-term sustainability of sector efficiency is the introduction&#13;
of: (i) competition where competition can efficiently regulate prices and supply, and (ii)&#13;
appropriate regulation or co-ordinating mechanisms, as needed to manage or co-ordinate other&#13;
aspects of system operation.&#13;
3.24   Hence the issues arising from this overview of sector structure and competition policy are:&#13;
6   "Maitre d'oeuvre" is the party responsible for supervising the tendering, contracting and project&#13;
supervision process. "Maitre d'ouvrage" is the owner of the assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
*     the future role and structure of EECI should be re-defined in the context of a&#13;
power system likely to become increasingly unbundled over time;&#13;
*     arrangements remain to be developed for systematically opening the sector to&#13;
competition at such a time and for those functions where competition would&#13;
enhance sectoral efficiency;&#13;
*     appropriate regulatory and co-ordinating mechanisms are needed to administer&#13;
non-competitive functions and those requiring co-ordination to assure the system's&#13;
efficacy.&#13;
3.25   The project includes four provisions for addressing the above-mentioned issues, to result&#13;
in specific implementation measures over 1996-1997 to be coordinated with IDA.&#13;
*     a review of system planning&#13;
*     a tariff study and tariff adjustment mechanism.&#13;
*     a review  of sector structure, allocation of responsibilities and financial&#13;
management of the sector.&#13;
*     preparation of standard bidding documents for IPPs.&#13;
3.26   During negotiations agreement was reached that GOCI will consult annually with IDA and&#13;
other donors in the sector on the power sector investment program, and that before undertaking&#13;
major changes to the organizational structure of the electricity sub-sector which may have an&#13;
adverse impact on the objectives of the Project, GOCI shall exchange views with IDA.&#13;
3.27   GOCI supports the encouragement of more private investor participation in the power&#13;
sector as weli as the above mentioned institutional development initiatives (para 3.25). These&#13;
commitments are reflected in the GOCI Letter of Sector Development Policy (LSDP) (available in&#13;
the Project File). Agreement on the LSDP was reached during negotiations, and IDA has received&#13;
the LSDP, signed June 1, 1995.&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Background to Project Development and Rationale for IDA Participation&#13;
4.1    GOCI has made a solid commitment to private investor participation in the power sector&#13;
(Chapter III), firstly in 1990 by leasing the system to a private consortium, subsequently&#13;
proceeding with the development of the "Foxtrot" project, then modified, as explained in para 4.3&#13;
and 4.4, to become the United Meridian Corporation (UMC) natural gas development and CIPREL&#13;
power projects. The CIPREL project is the first commissioned IPP in Africa.&#13;
4.2    The Bank has been assisting GOCI since the late 1980s with refonn of the energy sector&#13;
under the ESAL and since 1990 with the development of the Foxtrot project. Foxtrot, and the&#13;
subsequent UMC and CIPREL projects, were designed to involve private sector resources and&#13;
skills in the development of C8te d'Ivoire's indigenous natural gas resources in line with a least-cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
electricity supply strategy. Foxtrot was the first field to have demonstrated sufficient reserves to be&#13;
of interest for project development. Thus, Foxtrot was to have been an integrated scheme in which&#13;
a new private energy company would sell electricity and natural gas to CIE, natural gas to SIR and&#13;
industrial customers, and Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) to SIR.&#13;
4.3    However, during project preparation in late 1993/early 1994, work was proceeding (by&#13;
UMC with financial support from IFC) on proving-up the potential of the Lion and Panthere fields.&#13;
Through this period there was an open issue of the gas development strategy - i.e. the sequencing&#13;
of field development. During this period, the Bank was assisting GOCI's energy strategy&#13;
development through in-situ technical assistance and on-going dialogue between Bank staff and&#13;
their Ivorian counterparts. At the time of the Foxtrot project appraisal (January 1994), the Foxtrot&#13;
field was the most obviously "ready" candidate for early development, and it appeared to be an&#13;
economic fuel source. The timing and nature of the final results from work on the other two fields&#13;
was not known at the time, and there was some urgency to moving forward, given the importance&#13;
of securing the power supply with additional thermal capacity. Hence the appraisal proceeded on&#13;
the basis of priority to the Foxtrot field.&#13;
4.4    Within a few months after appraisal, UMC confirmed sufficient hydrocarbon potential in&#13;
the Lion and Panthere fields to justify reconsidering the gas development strategy. Moreover, the&#13;
Lion field contains oil and associated gas, whereas Foxtrot is only non-associated gas. Therefore&#13;
GOCI approached the Bank with the idea of delaying Foxtrot, but moving forward with Lion and&#13;
Panthere in order to produce the oil from the Lion field, while at the same time generating&#13;
electricity with the associated natural gas. This necessitated splitting the natural gas and electricity&#13;
components into separate projects, and negotiating new agreements with the different entities for&#13;
each component. The Bank indicated its willingness to appraise an amended project development&#13;
strategy involving private investors in the electricity subsector, indicating that any eventual&#13;
financing from the Bank would only be complementary to that of the private sector and supportive&#13;
of a stronger private sector role in the power system. GOCI issued requests for proposals to private&#13;
sponsors and selected a consortium of Bouygues/EDF which formed the nucleus of CIPREL&#13;
(Compagnie Ivoirienne de Production d'Electricite).&#13;
4.5    CIPREL's proposal was to develop a power plant in two phases with total capacity of&#13;
165 MW, costing approximately US$106 million of 1994 (Phase I US$68 million, Phase II,&#13;
US$38 million). During contract negotiations 7 all reasonable attempts were made to achieve a&#13;
substantial equity share in CIPREL, and to find private money to finance Phase II. The financial&#13;
structure which emerged reflected the exposure limits of the private sector and other lenders on this&#13;
operation: GOCI and CIPREL signed a contract wherein the CIPREL group assumed&#13;
responsibility for financing the first 100MW (Phase I), and which required that the Government be&#13;
responsible for financing the remainder (Phase II). CIPREL's financing of Phase I is 25 percent&#13;
equity and 75 percent debt, the lenders being IFC, Cafssefranpalse de Developpement (CFD) and&#13;
the Banque Ouest-Africaine de Developpement (BOAD). Under the proposed project, GOCI&#13;
would borrow from IDA the financing it is committed to provide for Phase II. The Government&#13;
loan of IDA funds to CIPREL on commercial terms would be complementary to the resources that&#13;
it was possible to raise from the private sector. The financial structure (firm for Phase I and&#13;
envisaged for Phase II) is given in the table below:&#13;
7   The Bank's on-going technical assistance to GOCI's energy sector development strategy provided&#13;
support to this process.&#13;

4.6    The GOCI/CIPREL General Agreement of July 1994 is a significant event in the&#13;
development of private power in sub-Saharan Africa, insofar as it is the first of its kind in that&#13;
area: an IPP BOOT (without an obligatory transfer of the property back to the Government). The&#13;
key cmmarcial features of this agreenent are summaized in Annex 4-1. In essence, CIPREL&#13;
assumes responsibilities to the State for completion, completion delay, cost over-rn, annual&#13;
act quantity, maintenance, repair and renovation, while the State has a minimum payment&#13;
oligation, a fuel supply obligation, and a right to buy-back the plant after ten years of operation.&#13;
Every year GOCI and CIPREL will agree on actual production from the CIPREL units, so as to&#13;
dispatch the entire electricity supply at least cost.&#13;
4.7    The proposed credit, would support significant and far-reaching developmental objectives&#13;
with respect to the overall technical integrity of the power system, and most importantly, the&#13;
efficacy and sustainability of reformed sector structures (see chapter III). The LSDP stated&#13;
objectives include reducing costs, improving efficiency, and avoiding monopoly in power&#13;
generation. To this effect, it wiU invite independent power producers (IPP) to build the power&#13;
plants needed in the future. No one group would be allowed to hold more than a predefined&#13;
percentage of the country's electrical capacity, the intention being to foster competition.&#13;
4.8    System expansion analysis undertaken for the proposed project indicates that future&#13;
competition among private power producers should be possible. Three kinds of competition may&#13;
be envisaged: competition for the market, competition within the market, and competition in&#13;
procurement. As a result of the economic recovery accompanying the structural adjustment&#13;
program agreed with the Bank and the IMF, over the past year electricity demand grew by about 7&#13;
percet. Future demand is expected to grow by at least 5 percent per year, given that only 25&#13;
percent of the population have now access to electricity. Under these demand conditions, Cote&#13;
d'Ivoire would need about 260 MW beyond the CIPREL project, over the next 10 years to be&#13;
developed in four or five increments individually timed to match requirements. This would allow&#13;
open competition (based on least-cost criteria) for different groups to enter the market with new&#13;
capacity, fueled by naturl gas (Chapter VI). Hence the beginnigs of compettive market&#13;
conditons are foreseeable. The process of selecting CIPREL was competitive and the contract cost&#13;
of Phase I was at CIPREL's risk. The Phase II gas turbine costs (resulting from ICB and&#13;
negotiaed financing terms) will be passed through the power price which CIPREL charges the&#13;
power sector. In these conditions, another element of competition - competitive procurement - is&#13;
needed to assure least-cost inplementation of Phase II. IDA financing of these turbines entails the&#13;
support and advice required to achieve this objective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
4.9   CMte d'Ivoire requires financial and technical support to pursue its agenda of institutional&#13;
and structural reform along the lines indicated above. This is consistent with the main objective of&#13;
IDA's on-going participation in the development of CMte dlvoire's power sector, which is to&#13;
support the necessary deepening and progression of institutional and structural reform. In&#13;
particular, IDA would be providing important support to the development of competitive market&#13;
structures in the power sector, thereby increasing the role of future private investors in the sector.&#13;
This includes the development of transparent arms' length regulatory processes, clear principles of&#13;
tariff setting, clarification of the roles and responsibilities of the various public sector entities&#13;
active in the power sector, and establishment of pro-competitive "rules of the game" through&#13;
standard bidding documents for forthcoming IPPs, which are all necessary components for&#13;
implementing a sectoral framework conducive to attracting a wide range of competitors for a&#13;
market share in the generation segment of CMte d'lvoire's power sector.&#13;
4.10   "Complementary investments" are necessary to assure the technical integrity of the power&#13;
system, and the proposed project makes provision for them (para 4.13(c)). These investments relate&#13;
mainly to the power transmission and transformation segments of the system. These segments are&#13;
under private sector management, but the public sector owns these assets and is responsible for&#13;
major maintenance and renovation, which is now essential to system reliability and the&#13;
effectiveness of private sector operations - be it for CIE's management functions or the utility of&#13;
the CIPREL investment. Hence, here as well, IDA financing is complementary to the private sector&#13;
input and necessary to sustain it.&#13;
4.11   The Bank's policy on lending to the electric power sector states that Bank lending for&#13;
electric power will focus on countries with a clear commitment to improving sector performance in&#13;
respect of (i) transparent regulation, (ii) corporatization, commercialization and private sector&#13;
participation, and (iii) contracting-out of services. C6te d'Ivoire has demonsaed this clear&#13;
commitment with the actions it has taken on sector reform to date, including those embodied in this&#13;
project (chapter mI and para 4.13(a)). The use of IDA resources for this project also recognizes&#13;
that C6te d'lvoire is a heavily indebted country, recently emerging frorn a long period of recession&#13;
with the help of a Bank/Fund adjustment program, an important element of which Was the halving&#13;
of the exchange rate between the CFA franc and the French franc. In sum, the proposed IDA&#13;
credit is consistent with the country assistance strategy (Chapter I) and would support an&#13;
integrated package of goods, services and advice all designed to assist the progress of C8te&#13;
d'Ivoire's power sector into increasingly pro-competitive, private sector modes of operation.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
4.12   The objectives of the proposed project are to:&#13;
(a)    continue the restructuring of power sector institutions begun under the ESAL,&#13;
particularly an appropriate regulatory fiamework and strengthened institutional&#13;
capabilities, thus enabling the development of competitive and expanded private&#13;
sector participation;&#13;
(b)   improve power supply reliability, reduce enviromnental impacts and reduce the&#13;
cost of electricity by supporting efficient gas-fired capacity using indigenous&#13;
natural gas developed under a private sector BOOT arrangement; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
(c)    enhance operational reliability and efficiency through  reinforcement and&#13;
improvements of the transmission system.&#13;
C.    Project Description&#13;
4.13   The project includes the following three major components, contents of which are detailed&#13;
in Annex 4-2&#13;
(a)    Institutional Development Component&#13;
(i)    Power Sector Management Study, including:&#13;
*      distribution of sector responsibilities&#13;
*     development of a power sector regulatory framework&#13;
*      assessment of manpower planning and training requirements&#13;
*      implementation proposals&#13;
This work arises out of needs identified in paras 3.12 to 3.25. It will identify the&#13;
roles and responsibilities of each entity in the sector. The regulatory framework&#13;
will be designed to operate within the Government's policy framework at arms'&#13;
length of the utilities and the Government. It will help promote an environment of&#13;
efficient private sector participation, while protecting the public interest. It will&#13;
mainly cover entry, performance monitoring and terms and conditions of service.&#13;
Training needs for public administration of the recommended sector structures will&#13;
be identified, and arrangements for implementing these proposals put in place.&#13;
(terms of reference are in the Implementation Manual). Detailed terms of&#13;
reference were agreed during negotiations.&#13;
(ii)    Power System Investment, Operations and Pricing Study, including:&#13;
*     preparation of load forecast (including scope for demand management)&#13;
*      development of a least-cost system expansion (generation, transmission,&#13;
distribution, loss reduction)&#13;
*     tariff study (including revaluation of major fixed assets and pricing&#13;
formulas)&#13;
Load forecasting and system planning work will be necessary for administering an&#13;
orderly and efficient process of expanding private sector involvemnent. It will give&#13;
guidance to the Government for the kinds and amounts of investments to elicit&#13;
from the private sector, evaluating the merits of proposals put before it, and - as&#13;
the private sector will not finance everything - judiciously selecting a&#13;
complementary public investment program. The tariff study is essential for putting&#13;
the process of electricity pricing and price adjustment on a transparent, arms'&#13;
length, technical basis which meets satisfactory economic efficiency and financial&#13;
performance criteria (terns of reference are in the Implementation Manual).&#13;
Detailed terms of reference were agreed during negotiations.&#13;
(iii)   Measures to Encourage Further Sector Privatization:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
*      standard IPP bid document&#13;
*      study to determine the cost of energy from Vridi steam thermal units and&#13;
their future role in the power generation in RCI.&#13;
The standard IPP document will give the Government an instrument for efficiently&#13;
attracting and evaluating a broader range of potential private sector entrants into&#13;
future, new generation projects. With regard to existing capacity, the steam units&#13;
cannot produce at design capabilities without substantial rehabilitation.&#13;
Alternative studies have varied on the merits of undertaking this work. A study&#13;
will be carried out to determine the feasibility of withdrawing these units from the&#13;
CIE concession for a private sector rehabilitation and operation under a power&#13;
purchase agreement with CIE (terms of reference for the preparation of these&#13;
documents are in the Implementation Manual). Detailed terms of reference were&#13;
agreed during negotiations.&#13;
(iv)   Hydrocarbon Sector Studies:&#13;
*      hydrocarbon production and distribution system planning&#13;
*      butane utilization and implementation arrangements&#13;
This group of studies will focus particularly on the organization and allocation of&#13;
responsibilities for up-stream activities, relationships between private sector&#13;
participants and electricity producers, enabling conditions for competition, safety&#13;
standards, technical standards, and environmental legislation. Also, an analysis is&#13;
needed of prospective hydrocarbons supply, demand and production/marketing&#13;
strategy, to assure an optimal exploitation of the resource base. The development&#13;
of the natural gas resource will also enable the development of an LPG industry&#13;
for domestic consumption and export, for which a development and production&#13;
strategy analysis is needed (terms of reference are in the Implementation Manual).&#13;
(b)    Generation Expansion&#13;
Generation expansion comprises supply and erection of one or two identical simple&#13;
cycle gas turbines of capacity between approximately 75 MW and 105 MW'; The&#13;
gas turbines will constitute Phase II of the CIPREL power plant, located at Vridi;&#13;
the plant layout for the gas turbines will be designed such that a heat recovery&#13;
boiler could be added at a later stage in order to operate the units as a combined-&#13;
cycle plant; and engineering and construction supervision.&#13;
(c)    Complementary Sector Investments&#13;
This includes extension of the 90 kV substation at Vridi to accommodate the&#13;
CIPREL power plant capacity expansion; reinforcement of the transmission&#13;
system around Abidjan in order to improve system reliability in case of loss of the&#13;
225 kV transmission line, including for this purpose: extending the 90kV&#13;
This capacity range is designed to allow the maximum number of manufacturers of gas turbines to&#13;
participate in the bidding process, within the limits of the capacity required at this time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
transmission system between Treichville and Plateau substations (comprising two&#13;
circuits of 90kV cables of about four kilometers each and associated substation&#13;
equipment), and tapping the 90kV transmission line between BiaSud and Ayame&#13;
at Riviera substation; rebuilding the Treichville 90/15kV substation; and&#13;
replacement of some 60 kilometers of l5kV paper-insulated cables.&#13;
D.      Project Cost&#13;
4.14    The total cost of the project, including contingencies and interest during construction, is&#13;
estimated at US$86.29 million. The foreign exchange component is about US$81.94 million,&#13;
equivalent to approximately 95 percent of the total project cost. The cost of the private sector&#13;
generation component is about US$50 million.&#13;
4.15    The project base cost is in January 1995 prices.  Physical contingencies of about 10&#13;
percent for goods, works and services have been applied except for the power plant (CIPREL&#13;
Phase II), no contingencies have been included. Price escalation based on the Unit Value Index of&#13;
Manufactured Exports (MUV Index) of 2.5 percent per year, are also included. In accordance&#13;
with agreements entered between the Government and CIPREL there are no taxes and duties&#13;
applicable to the project. A summary of project cost is provided in the table below; Annex 4-3&#13;
provides a detailed cost estimate.&#13;

E.      Financing Plan&#13;
4.16    An IDA  Credit of US$79.66 million equivalent is proposed to the Republic of Cote&#13;
dlvoire. Of this amount US$50 million would be on-lent to CIPREL under a Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement between the Government and CIPREL for the Phase II of CIPREL power plant. The&#13;
on-lending terms would be 17 years (the duration of the concession of CIPREL) including 5 years&#13;
grace at 8 percent per year. The S years grace are to allow for the debt service payment for&#13;
CIPREL Phase I, which has an average amortization period of about 10 years, without&#13;
jeopardizing the sector. The balance of the project cost US$6.62 million will be financed by the&#13;
sector. Tle remaining US$29.66 million of the lDA Credit would finance the foreign exchange&#13;
component of the Power System Reinforcement and the Institutional Building Components. Ihe&#13;
financing plan is given in the table below. The signature of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4.18    The Power Plant (CIPREL Phase II) will be procured through ICB in a single lot (supply&#13;
and erection) including civil works and all auxiliaries. No prequalification was carried out,&#13;
however, the bid documents include post-qualification requirements. The capacity of the power&#13;
plant has been defined in the bidding documents as a range between 75 and 105 MW in order to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
allow the maximum number of manufacturers and suppliers to bid while fulfilling the power&#13;
system capacity requirement.&#13;
4.19   The substation and transmission system expansion and reinforcement will be procured&#13;
through ICB in four separate lots for supply and erection. No prequalification will be carried out,&#13;
however, post-qualification requirements will be included in the bidding documents. The 15kV&#13;
cables will be procured through ICB. The installation of the cables will be carried out by local&#13;
contractors and supervised by EECI.&#13;
4.20   Goods contracts for the supply of equipment and vehicles will be procured through ICB&#13;
with the exception of (i) goods estimated to cost less than US$200,000, which in aggregate will not&#13;
exceed US$350,000, and will be procured through LIB, and (ii) goods estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$50,000, which in aggregate will not exceed US$300,000, will be procured through Shopping&#13;
by comparing price quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, to ensure competitive&#13;
prices.&#13;
4.21   IDA-financed consultancy contracts totaling about US$8 million will be awarded in&#13;
accordance with IDA's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). During negotiations,&#13;
it was agreed that all construction will be supervised by consultants acceptable to the Association&#13;
under agreed terms of reference and following Bank guidelines. Training programs would be&#13;
approved annually. A detailed procurement table giving the estimated man-months for consulting&#13;
services and the procurement methods is given in Annex 4-4.&#13;
4.22   Procurement review. All contracts for goods and works exceeding USS200,000 will be&#13;
subject to prior review. Bank standard bidding documents and standard contracts appropriately&#13;
modified to meet project needs, would be used for procurement of goods, works and services.&#13;
Contracts for goods under international or local shopping will be subject to random post review.&#13;
All procurement for services exceeding US$100,000 for consulting firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals will be subject to prior review, and other procurement for services will be subject to&#13;
post review. IDA continues to require prior review for (i) terms of reference of consultant contracts&#13;
regardless of value; and (ii) any standard documents that the Borrower(s) intends to use repeatedly.&#13;
Prior review will consist of reviewing bidding documents, advertisements, advertising procedures,&#13;
prior to solicitation of bids, as well as reviewing bid evaluation reports and proposed contract&#13;
awards. Agreement on the above procurement arrangements was reached during negotiations.&#13;
G.    Disbursements&#13;
4.23   The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999 as shown in Annex 4-5.&#13;
Disbursement per category is indicated in the following table. Given the availability of the Special&#13;
Account (SA), the minimum application for direct payment by IDA would normally be for the&#13;
equivalent of 20 percent of the initial deposit to the SA. All withdrawals from the credit account&#13;
would be fully documented except for expenditures relating to trining, contrcts for goods and&#13;
works costing less than US$200,000, which will be eligible for reimbursement on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOE). SOE would also be used for consultants services contracts&#13;
costing less than US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 equivalent for each individual.&#13;
Documentation of SOEs will be retained by DCGTx on behalf of the Project Unit and will be made&#13;
available for review by IDA supervision missions and auditors.&#13;

4.24   Special Account. To facilitate disbursements, a SA for GOCI would be opened in the&#13;
CAA. The initial deposit would be in CFA franc equivalent to US$1.0 million estimated to cover&#13;
project expenditures for about four months. The SA will be replenished by submitting withdrawal&#13;
applications to IDA on a monthly basis, or more often when the account is diminished by one-third.&#13;
Replenishment applications submitted against the SA will include a bank statement showing&#13;
account activity since the last application, with the balance certified by the CAA holding the SA, a&#13;
reconciliation statement and supporting documents as required by IDA. As a condition of&#13;
effectiveness, GOCI will open a Project Account (PA) and deposit CFA franc equivalent to&#13;
US$200,000 (para 7.2(b)). It was agreed during negotiations that the amount in the Project&#13;
Account would be replenished on a quarterly basis up to US$200,000 equivalent or when the PA&#13;
balance is less than US$50,000 equivalent.&#13;
4.25   Accounting and Auditing.  Project account will be maintained by the Project Unit&#13;
(para 4.26) in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards (IASC). Audited accounts&#13;
and reports, prepared by independent auditors, would be submitted to IDA no later than six months&#13;
after the end of each fiscal year. These will include the audit of CIPREL accounts. The auditor's&#13;
report on project expenditures will verify that (i) project accounts pennit identification of all&#13;
receipts and payments, (ii) goods had been received or work performed, (iii) payments had been&#13;
made, (iv) all expenditures had been legitimate, and (v) the SA have been used appropriately. The&#13;
auditors will provide an opinion on the reliability of the SOE procedures and on whether the goods&#13;
and services acquired under the project were being utilized in accordance with its objectives. The&#13;
auditors would also prepare the audit report including the management letter revealing possible&#13;
shortcomings in the staffing, accounting system and efficiency of the internal control procedures.&#13;
The appointment of auditors, acceptable to IDA will occur no later than six months after credit&#13;
effectiveness. Assurances on the foregoing were obtained during negotiations.&#13;
H.    Project Implementation, Monitoring, Reporting&#13;
4.26   The power generation component will be implemented by CIPREL. CIPREL, the owner,&#13;
will also be the engineer supervising the construction of the plant.  CIPREL has already&#13;
implemented Phase I of the power plant (99 MW), which is now in service less than eight months&#13;
from contract signature. With the capacity of Phase II being defined as a range between 75 to 105&#13;
MW, the convention between GOCI and CIPREL and the legal agreement between CIPREL and&#13;
its lenders, for Phase I will have to be amended to reflect the capacity of the lowest evaluated&#13;
bidder. During negotiations, agreement was reached with GOCI on all the articles that will have to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
be amended in the General Agreement between GOCI and CIPREL and the Loan Agreements&#13;
between CIPREL and its Phase I lenders prior to contract award for Phase HI. As a condition of&#13;
credit effectiveness, all amendments to existing contractual agreements wil have to be approved&#13;
and signed by the respective parties (para 7.2(c)). The Complementary Sector Investments,&#13;
including the reinforcement and extension of the transmission system, will be implemented by the&#13;
existing Project Unit assited by EECI. The Project Unit, which comprises staff from DCGTx,&#13;
EECI and the Ministry of Mines and Energy was established by Ministerial Order No. 028 of&#13;
January 15, 1995 in support of activities financed under the PPF. The Institutional Development&#13;
Component will be implemented by Project Unit assisted by the Ministry of Mines and Energy,&#13;
DCGTx and PETROCI. During negotiations, agreement was reached with GOCI to maintain the&#13;
Project Unit for the duration of the Project with membership and responsibilities satisfactory&#13;
to IDA.&#13;
4.27   Consulting firms will be retained to assist the Project Unit in the preparation of engineering&#13;
studies, preparation of tender and contract documents, and evaluation of bids for the proposed&#13;
Complementary Sector Investments. These consulting firms will also assist in the construction&#13;
supervision for the substations and line works. All lines and substations works will be well&#13;
coordinated with CIE, the power system operator, who will also participate in the review of the&#13;
engineering design and construction supervision. Terms of Reference for the studies and technical&#13;
services have been agreed during negotiations.&#13;
4.28   The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999. The combustion turbines will&#13;
be operational by early 1997. The Project Unit is preparing an implementation manual for the&#13;
project. This implementation manual will include all terms of reference for the studies, the&#13;
implementation timetable, performance targets and performance indicators.  Contents of the&#13;
implementation manual were agreed during negotiations. Presentation of the final Implementation&#13;
Manual by GOCI to IDA is a condition of effectiveness (para 7.2(d)) A project implementation&#13;
schedule is set out in Annex 4-6.&#13;
4.29   Supervision Plan. The proposed project would require careful coordination and frequent&#13;
IDA supervision. The key areas for supervision are (i) periodic monitoring of the progress on&#13;
institutional studies and development plans, (ii) periodic review of the implementation of&#13;
institutional studies recommendations, (iii) periodic review of regulatory initiatives, (iv) monitoring&#13;
the compliance with covenants and the Letter of Sector Development Policy, (v) technical&#13;
supervision of CIPREL Phase R power plant and the complementary power system reinforcements,&#13;
and (vi) review and follow-up of procurement and disbursement. During supervision, the Bank&#13;
would undertake a review of the Bank-financed procurement.&#13;
4.30   Procurement information would be collected and recorded as follows: (i) prompt reporting&#13;
of contract award information by the borrower, (ii) comprehensive quarterly reports to the Bank by&#13;
the borrower (assisted by consultants), indicating: (a) revised cost estimates for individual&#13;
contracts and the total project, including best estimates of allowance for physical and price&#13;
contingencies, (b) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding contract&#13;
award and completion time for individual contracts; and (iii) a completion report by the borrower&#13;
within six months of the credit's closing date. Supervision of the project would require expertise in&#13;
power systems engineering, economic and financial analysis and environmental engineenng. There&#13;
will be a review of implementation progress for CIPREL Phase II, no later than June 30, 1996,&#13;
covering CIPREL's performance on execution of Phase II, procurement, record keeping, audit and&#13;
environment. There would be a mid-term review in early 1997, with the participation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
Government and IDA. The review will conduct a comprehensive assessment of progress of&#13;
physical components and agree on actions required, if necessary to ensure the meeting of project&#13;
targets. Among other things, the review will cover performance of CIPREL, EECI, DCGTx and&#13;
the Project Unit, achievement of institutional objective, Borrower, FNEE and CIPREL compliance&#13;
with financial and audit obligations, execution of Phase II of the CIPREL Power Plant and&#13;
complementary sector investments, evolution of key performance indicators and environmental&#13;
factors.&#13;
I.     Environmental Impact&#13;
4.31   Key project objectives are to improve the efficiency and reliability of the power supply and&#13;
to reduce the environmental impacts through the transition from the use of liquid fuels and biomass&#13;
to natural gas. Positive global environmental impacts are therefore expected from the project as&#13;
well as localized benefits through a decrease in air pollution in the Abidjan area (reduction of No.&#13;
SO  and C02). A full Environmental Assessment (EA) has been carried out in a form acceptable&#13;
to IDA for the Foxtrot project. The EA was later amended to reflect the changes in the project&#13;
scope. The project design includes a series of measures that the project sponsor (CIPREL) will&#13;
take to minimize all potential negative environmental impacts. These measures are summarized in&#13;
para 4.32 and listed in detail in Annex 4-8.&#13;
4.32   The main environmental issues identified in the EA relate to noise level, risk of oil spills,&#13;
waste disposal and risks of fires and explosions. The noise level of the gas turbines will not exceed&#13;
85dB at one meter, as a result of adding acoustic enclosures. The new gas turbines will not affect&#13;
the present noise level at nearest residential areas. With regard to oil spills, the existing oil tanks in&#13;
VRIDI site have been refurbished and checked before use. For the tanks on CIPREL site, a&#13;
retention basin is installed with a complete fire protection and detection system. Liquid wastes are&#13;
drained to an existing settling pit and after separation, water is sent to the VRIDI collection and&#13;
rejection system. There are no other liquid effluents from the gas turbines. Gas and fire detection&#13;
systems, as well as fire fighting systems consisting of CO2 for the gas turbines, water for the&#13;
overall site and foam injection for the oil storage tanks will greatly minimize the risks of fires and&#13;
explosions. In addition, there will be regular monitoring of alarm and fire fighting systems. The&#13;
project envisages significant amount of training and skills development for staffing in the area of&#13;
safety and environmental monitoring.&#13;
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
5.1    The financial analysis provides an assessment of the financial status of CIPREL, and of&#13;
the electricity sector's financial equilibrium over 1994/95 - 2004/05. The analysis assumes a 189&#13;
MW installation in accordance with IDA proposed financing. Annex 5-1 provides a detailed&#13;
financial analysis of CIPREL and Annex 5-2 an analysis of the electricity sector financial&#13;
equilibrium.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
A.    Financial Assessment of CIPREL&#13;
CIPREL Ownership and Financing Structure&#13;
5.2    CIPREL is a private holding company created for the purpose of the project. The majority&#13;
stake in CIPREL (75 percent) is held by VALENER a company incorporated in C6te d'lvoire of&#13;
which 65 percent is held by SAUR, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bouygues and 35 percent by&#13;
EDF International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDF. Other project lenders (IFC, CFD and&#13;
BOAD) and PETROCI hold the remaining 25 percent of CIPREL's equity.&#13;
5.3    For the financing of the first phase (99 MW), equity financed 25 percent of project costs&#13;
and private long term debt the remaining 75 percent. The second phase (75 to 105 MW ISO&#13;
Conditions or 65-90 MW site rating) will be financed by a long term loan from the Republic of&#13;
CMte d'ivoire to CIPREL, onlending IDA resources. As a result, the initial debt:equity ratio of&#13;
75:25 will be increased to 86:14 (Annex 5-1, Table 1).&#13;
CIPREL Key Financial Information&#13;
5.4    The Convention between the Republic of CMte d'Ivoire and CIPREL  provides the&#13;
frarnework for defining CIPREL production levels and revenues. With gas turbines totaling 189&#13;
MW of site capacity and annual production levels and pricing based on provisions of the&#13;
Convention, CIPREL's base case annual revenues in constant 1994 units are estimated to be about&#13;
$28.8 million (Annex 5-1). CIPREL key financial indicators are shown in table below.&#13;

Project Financial Returns&#13;
5.5    With an installation of about 189 MW, the CIPREL financial rate of return is estimated to&#13;
be 15.8 percent and the rate of return on equity is estimated to be 21.4 percent. Tax on dividends&#13;
depends on nationality, and is 12 percent for French investors; there is no withholding tax on&#13;
dividends paid to international institutions such as IFC, CFD and BOAD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
B.    Electricity Sector Financial Equilibrium&#13;
5.6    This analysis compares the electricity sector financial requirements once the project is&#13;
commissioned with the revenues provided by the current tariffs and develops proposals for&#13;
electricity tariff policy. The sector includes operating entities such as CIE (managing public sector&#13;
assets), EECI (holding public sector assets), CIPREL, FNEE and certain functions of DCGTx&#13;
charged to the sector.&#13;
5.7    The 1995 average revenue of CF'A franc 571kWh (US$0.106/kWh) will be adequate to&#13;
cover all costs, service the sector debt and provide for a self-financing ratio usually exceeding 20&#13;
percent (Annex 5-2). Given the reduction of fuel costs due to use of natural gas, there would&#13;
appear to be some room for a slight decrease in tariffs. However an immediate tariff reduction is&#13;
not recommended. Tariff reduction may leave the sector with little flexibility in face of unexpected&#13;
events such as poor rainfall or unavailability of gas. Finally, a review of external debt service&#13;
obligations and the sector investment program is necessary for underpinning future tariff policy.&#13;
Electricity Tariff Adjustment Formula&#13;
5.8    Adjustment to electricity tariffs does not follow well-established and transparent rules. In&#13;
order to provide for a rational and transparent tariff setting framework, the Government will&#13;
establish a periodic adjustment mechanism ensuring that: (i) tariffs are adequate to cover operating&#13;
costs, debt service and a minimum 20 percent self-financing of the investment program; (ii)&#13;
increases or decreases in costs are born by or benefit the end-users. During negotiations, the GOCI&#13;
Delegation put forward a proposal for annual adjustment of the tariff based on the tariff being&#13;
sufficient to meet certain financial performance criteria, details of which are outlined in Annex 5-2.&#13;
Under this proposal, the tariff would be sufficient for the power sector to earn at least 8 percent&#13;
rate of return on its net assets in operation, provided that this rate of return is consistent with a debt&#13;
service ratio of 1.5, an operating ratio below 0.85 and self-financing ratio of at least 0.2.&#13;
Assurances to that effect were obtained during negotiations.&#13;
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    Introduction&#13;
6.1    The economic analysis of the project begins with the load forecast, the supply capability of&#13;
the existing system, and identifies the need for additional capacity as the deficit between expected&#13;
demand and available supply. The analysis then assesses whether the proposed project is the least-&#13;
cost system expansion option. Once confirmed as the least-cost option, the internal economic rate&#13;
of return is calculated on the basis of incremental economic benefits relative to incremental&#13;
economic costs, and sensitivity tests are done to assess the impact of changes in key uncertain&#13;
variables on the project's internal rate of return.&#13;
B.    Electricity Demand Forecast&#13;
6.2    The base case load growth projection broadly reflects a positive medium term economic&#13;
outlook for the country. Most significantly:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
*  GDP growth is expected to be about 6 percent in 1995/96, with expected good&#13;
performance of the industrial sector and an up-take of private consumption induced partly&#13;
by the devaluation of the CFA franc;&#13;
* the Government has indicated its intention to pursue a high growth strategy combined with&#13;
sound monetary and fiscal policies, and has established targets as well as an enabling&#13;
strategy in close consultation with the IMF and the Bank;&#13;
*  over the long term in the past (Annex 6-1, page 1), growth of electricity consumption has&#13;
outpaced that of the key economic variables underlying that consumption, largely&#13;
reflecting a relatively high growth rate of new customer connections and resilience of&#13;
consumption per customer, which are expected to continue into the future.&#13;
6.3    Under the circumstances, load growth should be no less than 5 percent per year over the&#13;
next three years, and based on an econometric projection, 5.2 percent per year thereafter9. In the&#13;
case of Cote d'Ivoire, provided that the load will not actually decline, the accuracy of the longer&#13;
term load forecast is not critical to project risk: once the natural gas supply is established, current&#13;
information indicates that the least-cost generation expansion program should consist of gas&#13;
turbines, which can be sized and timed appropriately with load growth, as perceived quite soon&#13;
before investment. The load forecast assumes no real increase of tariffs.'0&#13;
6.4    With the development of economic natural gas-based gas turbine capacity, C&amp;te d'Ivoire&#13;
will become well positioned to export electricity to neighboring countries. An export contract for&#13;
60 GWh/year to Burkina Faso is in place, and the transmission interconnection project underway.&#13;
This export is included as a firm load in the forecast. Two other export contracts were under&#13;
negofiation at time of post-appraisal: 50 MW continuous to VRA (Ghana) and 30 MW continuous&#13;
to CEB (Togo and Benin), subject to annual review of quantity and price. These recent&#13;
developments are not included in the load forecast.&#13;
C.    Electricity Supply&#13;
Hydro Plants&#13;
6.5    Performance of the hydro system has been highly variable; however, it is reasonable to&#13;
use a figure of 1216 GWh/year to represent "expected" hydro production for simulating "normal"&#13;
operation of the systen and 565 GWh for firm supply capability. (Annex 6-1, page 2)&#13;
Thermal Plants&#13;
6.6    The mission reviewed recent operational experience with the existing thermal plants, and&#13;
the contractual performance commitments for the CIPREL Phase I facility, which has been&#13;
commissioned in March 1995. Annex 6-1, page 2 shows the up-dated estimates adopted for&#13;
systen planning and simulation.&#13;
9      This would reflect a long-tenn GDP growth projection of about 5 percent per year.&#13;
l0     Since the early 1980s, the real average tariff has fluctuated within a very narrow range, with no trend either&#13;
up or down. A case could be made for reducing tariffs once natural-gas and hydro based generation provide&#13;
a substantial portion of total supply, however, before doing so, it is important to establish the future&#13;
program and costing of transmission and distribution system expansion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
D.    Demand: Supply Balance&#13;
6.7    Annex 6-1 (page 2) indicates that the system as presently installed (including CIPREL&#13;
Phase I) is energy constrained: there is not enough energy generation capability to meet the&#13;
system's annual energy requirements on a firm basis. Before considering any export to VRA or&#13;
CEB, and including CIPREL Phase I, without additional capacity there would be an energy-related&#13;
capacity deficit of about 44 MW in 1995, growing to 63 MW in 1996 and 323 MW by 2005. The&#13;
required timing and amount of new capacity was broadly confirmed in modeled system simulation&#13;
runs, which provide a more detailed assessment of usable capacity and optimal dispatching on a&#13;
month to month basis over the entire simulation period.&#13;
E.    Least-Cost System Expansion Program&#13;
6.8    Generation system expansion costs are determined primarily by the cost, size and timing of&#13;
new power plants, and the cost of fuel. Gas turbines provide the lowest capital cost per kW and&#13;
quickest construction and commissioning cycle of any thermal plant. CMte d'Ivoire's gas turbine&#13;
expansion program is based on indigenous natural gas, which is now being developed in parallel&#13;
with the CIPREL Phase I power plant. The existing gas turbine plant, currently using oil, will be&#13;
converted to natural gas in late 1995/early 1996. The natural gas volumes likely to be needed for&#13;
power generation and SIR over the next twenty years were estimated and compared with the known&#13;
deliverable reserves from Lion, Panthere and Foxtrot. These reserves will be adequate to meet the&#13;
requirements till near the end of the study period (2009/10), when small make-up volumes from&#13;
other sources (identified but not delineated) may be needed.&#13;
6.9    The economic cost per mcf of natural gas to the power sector was estimated on the basis of&#13;
the gas sales contract, taking into account current projections of requirements and world oil prices&#13;
yielding US$0.87/mcf (equivalent to about $5.20/bbl oil). As there is no cheaper combination of&#13;
capital and fuel costs for thermal generation, and no hydro development of this size in CMte d'lvoire&#13;
which could compete with these costs or be developed as quickly, gas turbines using natural gas is&#13;
the least cost strategy of system generation capacity expansion. Nonetheless, the economic cost of&#13;
substituting low-speed Diesel plant for the proposed investment was estimated in order to measure&#13;
the extent of the gas turbines' advantage over the next best option. The present worth costs (10&#13;
percent discount rate) of the gas turbines versus low speed Diesel as the first plant after CIPREL&#13;
Phase I are as follows:&#13;

Net Advantage of CIPREL Phase II                                    55&#13;
F.    Economic Worth of CIPREL Phase II&#13;
6.10   The economic worth of the investment is indicated by the economic internal rate of return&#13;
(EIRR) of incremental benefits relative to incremental costs over a twenty year period of system&#13;
development and operation based on the least cost system expansion strategy. The incremental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
benefit per kWh is the average tariff (US$0.106/kWh) ", less the incremental economic costs of&#13;
transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) estimated at USS0.058/kWh (at 10 percent social discount&#13;
rate), yielding USS0.048/kWh at point of generation. Incremental energy sales in GWh are the&#13;
difference between sales which the system can supply with system expansion and those assuming&#13;
no expansion. Total incremental benefits are incremental sales times US$0.048/kWh.&#13;
6.11   Incremental costs are derived from sinulating system operation with and without the&#13;
generation expansion program over the twenty year economic life of the proposed project. With&#13;
CIPREL Phase n1 of 66 MW, the EIRR to the net cash flow is 34 percent (Annex 6-1, page 3 &amp; 4).&#13;
If CIPREL Phase II were a 90 MW plant, and assuming about 5 percent decrease of plant cost per&#13;
kW, 7 percent fuel efficiency increase, displacement of fuel oil use in 1996 and reduction in size of&#13;
the first increment aflter CIPREL, the EIRR would be 35 percent with no change in the load&#13;
forecast. The apparently high EIRRs occur because the average tariff is high, while the&#13;
incremental system cost of generation (at 10 percent social discount rate) is relatively low&#13;
(US$0.042/kWh).&#13;
G.    Sensitivity Tests:&#13;
6.12   The Base Case EIRR is tested for uncertainty of key factors as follows:&#13;
Table 6.2: Sensitivty Tests&#13;
a'ab les                                                           New E          ---&#13;
Incremental T&amp;D cost increased from US$0.058/kWh to USS0.064/kWh          10&#13;
Load growth reduced from 5.2 percent to 3.5 percent per year              15&#13;

Summary of Key Features of the Convention between C8te d'Ivoire and CIPREL&#13;
The following summary is provided only to give the reader a general understanding of the nature of&#13;
the agreement. It is not a substitute for the Convention for any purpose. All provisions of the&#13;
Convention are considerably more detailed.&#13;
1.    CIPREL assumes certain responsibilities vis-a-vis C6te d'Ivoire with respect  to&#13;
completion, completion delay for Phase I and capital cost over-run. The capital cost and capital&#13;
portion of the price relating to Phase I capacity became fixed and firm as of the conclusion of the&#13;
relevant financing agreements. For Phase II, cost adjustment is provided for differences between&#13;
the actual costs and on-lending terms relative to those suggested in the Convention, once the&#13;
contract is awarded and the on-lending terms between the Government and CIPREL are finalized.&#13;

Thereafter, CIPREL is at risk for cost over-run, completion and completion delay&#13;
2.     CIPREL has an annual supply obligation (as of dates certain covering the first 99MW)&#13;
for the duration of the Convention, in default of which penalties apply. For example, with 165 MW&#13;
of capacity, the maximum obligation is for 1150 GWh (availability factor of almost 80%). The&#13;
penalty applies to differences between programmed and actual deliveries, and can be either 8% or a&#13;
combination of 8% and 38% of the price, depending upon the volume of the shortfall. If in two&#13;
successive years CIPREL is unable to deliver the cumulative ACQ2, the Convention can be&#13;
annulled.&#13;
3.     CIPREL earns a bonus for energy requested and delivered over and above the ACQ. The&#13;
bonus for the marginal kWh beyond ACQ can range from about 5% to 38% of the base price,&#13;
depending upon the volumes taken in excess of ACQ.&#13;
4.     CIPREL is obligated to undertake all inspections, maintenance, repairs and renewals to&#13;
keep the units in proper operating condition for the life of the Convention, and to undertake a&#13;
perfornance test of each unit every year.&#13;
5.     CIPREL is responsible for an environmental impact study and implementation of measures&#13;
it considers necessary in light of the study conclusions.&#13;
6.     On the authority of the State, CIE has an obligation to pay CIPREL for the ACQ2, the&#13;
price per kWh decreasing as capacity increases through three, four or five turbines commissioned.&#13;
This is equivalent to a capacity charge, because given the capacity to which it applies, it is&#13;
invariant with respect to actual kWh taken, and the State provides the fuel separately. The plant is&#13;
fully dispatchable, which allows the system operator to minimize the variable cost of meeting the&#13;
' Completion delay penalties are defined for Phase I, which was commissioned on schedule. For Phase II,&#13;
the cost to CIPREL of completion delay would be the absence of revenue to cover costs incurred.&#13;

load. Failure of the State to remedy a notified payment gap within 30 days of notification is&#13;
grounds for annulment of the Convention. The same applies for the State's failure to supply fuel.&#13;
7.    Take over and indemnity provisions are specified in case of annulment.&#13;
8.    Every year the State, CIE and CIPREL will agree on CIPREL's production, taking into&#13;
account optimal system dispatching requirements anticipated for the coming year.&#13;
9.    CIPREL is to invest its own equity for 25% of the Phase I costs, and the remaining 75% is&#13;
borrowed from IFC, CFD and BOAD. The State is to finance Phase II through public debt on-lent&#13;
to CIPREL.&#13;
10.   CIPREL is solely responsible for studies, technical specifications and documents, except&#13;
that the State has rights of approval for Phase II documents. CIPREL is solely responsible for&#13;
tendering on Phase I, while for Phase I, there wil be obligatory ICB, managed by CIPREL but&#13;
subject to State approval.&#13;
11.   CIPREL is solely responsible for implementation of tendering and construction. The State&#13;
has open access to the construction and manufacturing sites. CIPREL will report progress monthly&#13;
to the State. The State has the right to inspect and approve the acceptance of all CIPREL works.&#13;
12.   The State has the right to buy-back the CIPREL plant after the first ten years of operation,&#13;
in which case a specific agreement would be negotiated including compensation for the present&#13;
value (at time of buy-back) of foregone dividends to CIPREL and CIPREL's capital, and the take-&#13;
over of remaing debt service obligations.&#13;

DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
The project includes the following investments components:&#13;
Extension of CIPREL II Power Plant:&#13;
CIPREL Power Plant consists of CIPREL phase I (99MW) went in service in late&#13;
February and early March, 1995. The IDA project finances the CIPREL phase II which&#13;
consists of supply and erection of one or two Gas Turbines with total ISO rating between&#13;
75MW and 105MW. This gives a site rating of between 65MW and 90MW&#13;
approximately. This capacity range was defined with two purposes in mind: (a) meet the&#13;
capacity need for the sector; and (b) allow as mnany as possible manufacturers of Gas&#13;
Turbines to bid. The scope of work to be supplied include: the civil works, supply and&#13;
erection of the Gas Turbines, all electro mechanical accessories including power&#13;
transformers, extension to the 225kV substations and auxiliaries, supply of spare parts,&#13;
tools and a warehouse to store the parts and tools, and training for local staff.&#13;
2.    Rebuilding of the 90kV/15kV Treichville Substation&#13;
With more than 50 MVA transit (more than 10% of the system load) and seventeen 15kV&#13;
feeders, the Treicheville substation, is a crucial injection point for the power supply of&#13;
Abidjan. The present poor reliability of the substation directly impacts the quality of&#13;
supply and causes numerous power shortage in the Abidjan area. The new substation will&#13;
have:&#13;
-     two 90kV breakers&#13;
-     four 90kV line bays&#13;
-     three 90/15kV transformer bays&#13;
-     twenty 15kV feeders&#13;

-     twenty-five 90kV disconnecting switches&#13;
4.    S       g  the transnission system around Abidjan&#13;
In case of loss of the 22OkV semi ring around Abidjan, the existing 90kV system will not&#13;
be able to transit all the generating capacity at VRIDI during the peak. In order to provide&#13;
ths additonal reliability to the system, the following will be carried out.&#13;
(a)   In      eng the existing Plateau with the rebuilt Treicheville substation. The&#13;
work scope includes: about 4 km of two 90kV circuits, and two new 90kV&#13;
positions at the 90kV bus in Plateau substations.&#13;
Each 4 kn, 90kV circuit will be made of three insulated cables, including aU&#13;
necsary joints and accessories. The section of each cable will be 630 mm 2&#13;
aluminum.&#13;
The instllauon of two additional line bays at the 90kV Plateau substation wil&#13;
include the necessary civil work and the supply and erection of the foUowing&#13;
equipment:&#13;
the existing 90kV busbar extension&#13;

5.    The replacement of about 60 km of 15kV underground cables&#13;
The urban distribution network of Abidjan includes 700 km of l5kV cables, of which&#13;
about 60 km have been identified as unreliable and source of numerous power faults and&#13;
the loss of supply. These cables are very old (around 40 years) with an average of 20&#13;
splices per mn, a low insulation level (dried up oil impregnated paper), a poor trsit&#13;
capacity and high losses (22mm2 diameter conductor). These cables wifl be replaceod by&#13;
XLP 15kV cables, with 150 mm2 conductors.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE&#13;
PRIVATE SECTOR ENERGIE PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW SUhMMARY&#13;
1. This project consists of the construction and operation of a 75 - 105 MW ISO gas turbine&#13;
power plant as an expansion to the existing CIPREL power plant which is already equipped&#13;
with three turbines of 33 MW each (100 MWe in site conditions). The new turbines will be&#13;
installed in the same industrial area as the 3 others, adjacent to an existing power plant which&#13;
is oil-fired and in poor operational condition.&#13;
2. The plant will use natural gas as the prinary energy source, but it will also be able to use&#13;
heavy vacuum oil (HVO) as a back-up fuel.&#13;
3. The key environmental issues that were evaluated during the environmental review of this&#13;
project included:&#13;
- air emissions&#13;
- noise levels&#13;
4. Natural gas will be free of sulfur, fuel oil, if used in the new power plant, will have less than&#13;
0.5 percent sulfur by weight. S02 emissions, therefore, are expected to be negligible and in&#13;
compliance with Bank guidelines. NOx emission design specifications for the turbines are&#13;
expected not to exceed 115 ppm for 38 MW gas turbines. The high tempeature (5400C) and&#13;
high velocity (40m/s) of exhaust gses at the exit of the stack will lead to a very low NOx&#13;
concentration at ground level (few ug/m3). The use of natural gas fired turbines instead of oil-&#13;
fired units would result in a significant reduction of NOx enissions over current levels. It will&#13;
also reduce particulate emissions to virtuaDy zero.&#13;
5. Noise levels are generally of low significance in power plants using gas-fired turbines, and are&#13;
particularly of little concern in this industrial area. The new power plant will generate less&#13;
noise than the existing power plant.&#13;
6. The project will comply with local environmental regulations and World Bank guidelines.&#13;
7. The following table gives the nmtigation measures adopted by CIPREL m accordance with all&#13;
the potial negative impacts listed in the Environmental Assment Study made in April&#13;
1992 on FOXTROT BOOT Project by 'Vater &amp; SOILS Ltd".&#13;

safety of local people                 SOOm from the naest village&#13;
2. Noise level of 85 dB(A) at a dice of  2. The nois level of ga; turbines will not exceed 85 d13(A) at one meter by&#13;
3 m firm the tubines                   adding acoutic enclosues. The new gs turbina will not affect the prest&#13;
noise level at the narest residential as.&#13;
3. Dranae of the paved plant res.      3. Drainage of the paved plant area is collcted direly in an exstng sttng&#13;
Dicarge of waters from the              pit There is no demineralization unit in the CIPREL site. Ihe deminerlized&#13;
demineraliraton unit and other possible  water needed by CIPREL for boilers and compresor washing unit is derived&#13;
rocess water.                          directly from the existing demineralization unit at VRHI site.&#13;
4. Emissions of C02                     4. The efficiency of the new gas tubines wiIl be higher than exiding ones and&#13;
as efficient as the existing steam power plants in VRIDI site.&#13;
5. Risb of PCB emisions frm             5. The transformers are oiled ones and when burning oils do not develop&#13;
tmnsfonmer and capacitor oils during fires.   PCB.&#13;
6. Risk of oil spills frm  the oil storwage  6. The existing oil tnks in VRIDI site have been refibisbed and duly&#13;
tanks and pipelines.                   cebcked before use. For the daily tnks on CHPRE  site, a retention baxin is&#13;
installed with a complete fire protection and detection system.&#13;
7. Risk of chemical spiLs (NaO'H, NaCL,   7. Thre is no demin aized plant in CIPREL site.&#13;
HIS04) wbhen sxing and handling.&#13;
8. Emitsions of nitigen oxides (NOx).  8. The nitrogen oxide emissions are low due to natual gas use as main fuel.&#13;
If the new gas turbines are more often used than existing thermal power plants&#13;
which operate on fuel, the global NOx emissions frm VRIDI site will be&#13;
reduced&#13;
9. Emissios of paticles and S02, when    9. The CIPREL plant will use natual ps s its main fuel. The S02 emissions&#13;
using heavy vacuum oil as fuel.        wiIl be negligible. The particle emissions will be less than 10 mg/nm3,&#13;
thanks to the air filtration at the inlet of the gas turbines, the high enrgy and&#13;
excess air combustion and the negligible ash content in the naual gas used.&#13;
10. Recruitment of personnel.          10. The new ps turbines will not create many new jobs as most employees&#13;
wil be from the existing plant The person in charge of plat safety will also&#13;
be responsible for the envirowment and wiU receive the prope training.&#13;
11. Waste disposal                      11. Ordinay wastes should be disposed to a municipal landfill. Liquids are&#13;
drained to an existing settling pit and after sepamtion, water is sent to the&#13;
VRIDI collection and rejection system.&#13;

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF CIPREL&#13;
1.    This financial analysis provides an assessment of the financial status of CIPREL,&#13;
assumiing a 189 MW (site conditions) installation. Financial statements for CIPREL are simulated&#13;
on the basis of relevant provisions in the agroments between the State and CIPREL and CIPREL&#13;
and its financiers.&#13;
CIPREL Ownership and Financing Structure&#13;
2.     CIPREL is a private electricity generating company, in which 75% of the equity is held by&#13;
VALENER, a holding company incorporated in. Cte d'Ivoire of which 65% is held by SAUR ( a&#13;
wholly-owned subsidiary of Bouygues) and 35% by EDF International (a wholly-owned subsidiary&#13;
of EDF). The other 25% of the equity islheld in varying shares by IFC, PETROCI and other&#13;
investors.&#13;
3.    For Phase 1 (99MW), 25 percent of project costs are equity financed and 75% debt-&#13;
financed. Phase 2 (75MW to 105MW ISO conditions or 65MW to 90MW site conditions) will be&#13;
financed by a long-term loan from GOCI to CIPREL, consisting of funds onlent from IDA. For the&#13;
two phases together, the'resulting debt equity ratio will be 86:14. Table I shows a summary of the&#13;
financing plan.&#13;

Revenues:&#13;
4.    The July 1994 Convention between the Republic of CMte d'lvoire and CIPREL provides&#13;
the framework for defining annual contract quantities and prices according to the number of&#13;
megawatts of productive capacity. Annual revenue is estimated based on 189 MW (site conditions)&#13;
of capacity, using estimates of price and annual contract quantity to be derived by the contracting&#13;
party on the basis of the framework in the Convention. In the Convention, the price esfimate&#13;
assumes that Phase 2 financing will be made available at an interest rate of 7% and amorized over&#13;
18 years. The price will be similar for an on-lending agreement carrying 8% interest and 17 years'&#13;
amortization. This analysis does not include bonus revenues applicable in the Convention for&#13;
production exceeding the annual contract quantity. CIPREL's base case annual revenues are&#13;
estimated to be about $28.8 million.&#13;

Operating Expenses&#13;
5.     Tbe selling price of electrical energy from CIPREL to CIE covers debt service and all&#13;
operating costs other than fuel, which will be provided by the FNEE and the cost of which will be&#13;
recovered in the end-user tariff. CIE will operate and maintain the turbines under an operating&#13;
agreement between CIPREL and CIE. Annual maintenance costs are estimated at about 2.4 billion&#13;
CFA francs.&#13;
Net Income and Cash Flow&#13;
6.     CIPREL's simplified income statements for representative years and for a 189MW&#13;
scenario are shown in Table 2. Over each year of the period, CIPREL's net income will be&#13;
positive. Net operating income over revenues will be maintained at about 40 percent to 50 percent.&#13;
Operating income over net fixed assets in operation will increase steadily from 10 percent to about&#13;
62 percent in the last year of the Convention.&#13;

7.     Despite a high initial debt:equity ratio, CIPREL will generally meet its covenants to the&#13;
Phase 1 lenders, in particular the debt-service coverage ratio (minimum agreed value of 1.2) and a&#13;
six-month equivalent of debt service to private lenders (to be held in an offshore escrow account).&#13;
The five year grace period preceding debt service for the Phase 2 loan will moderate overall debt&#13;
service during the first five years of operations; however, when all debt service will be concurrent&#13;
(in FY 2002/03 and FY 2003/04) the debt service ratio will fall to between 1.0 and 1.1 in those&#13;
two years.&#13;
Balance Sheet Projection&#13;
8.     The projected balance sheet is sumnmaized in Table 3 for representative years.&#13;
Shareholders' equity increases over the first several years as debt repayment and dividend&#13;
distribution restrictions force CIPREL to retain most of its earnings.&#13;

Financial Returns&#13;
9.    The financial rate of return is estimated to be about 15.8%. The rate of return on equity&#13;
is estirnated to be 21.4%. Taxes on dividends depends upon nationality, and is 12% for French&#13;
investors. There is no withholding tax on dividends paid to international institutions such as IFC,&#13;
CFD and BOAD.&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
I.     FINANCIAL COVENANTS&#13;
1.    As part of the undertaking of Phase I of the project, financial covenants relevant to this&#13;
financial analysis are as follows:&#13;
(i)    Dividends Payment:  Dividends will be paid out of cumulative net&#13;
earnings and if the current ratio of CIPREL (including debt due within 12&#13;
months) exceeds 1.0 after payrnent of such dividends.&#13;
(ii)    Debt Service Coverage. Debt service coverage should not be less than&#13;
1.2.&#13;
(iii)   Escrow Account Reserve. An offshore escrow account reserve wiln be&#13;
established and be kept at the level needed to support six-month debt&#13;
payment, effective March 1996.&#13;

4.    These expenses are defined in the Convention between CIPREL and the State of C8te&#13;
d'Ivoire for an installation of 165MW. For a 189MW installation such costs have been adjusted&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
Depreciation&#13;
5.    Equipment costs are depreciated over 17 years on a straight-line basis, coincident with the&#13;
raining years in the Convention. Other non-project capital expenditures are depreciated also on a&#13;
straight-line basis at a rate of 20%/o/year.&#13;
Income Tax&#13;
6.    Income taxes are 35% of income before taxes. A tax holiday regime has been granted to&#13;
CIPREL according to which the tax exemption phases out gradually over a five year period.&#13;
Dividends&#13;
7.    Gross Dividends are paid out from cumulative cash subject to the condition that the&#13;
current ratio at the end of the fiscal year is no less than one and a minimum cash balance is&#13;
maintained. Gross dividends are subject to the following dividend tax:&#13;
FY95-02             18%&#13;
FY03-FY13           12%&#13;
Current Assets&#13;
Minimum cash balance MFCFA 300 (US$ 0.56 million)&#13;
8.    Lone Term Debt Service Account: An offshore debt service account for the debt&#13;
provided by the private lenders is to be maintained at the level of six-months of the next year's debt&#13;
service, subject to the condition that no short-term debt is incurred. This requirement does not&#13;
apply to IDA fiuds on-lent to CIPREL.&#13;
Accounts Receivable: 30 days of net revenues&#13;

Electricity Tariff Formula&#13;
General Provisions&#13;
1.    The average price per kilowatt hour of electricity sales to domestic customers will&#13;
be sufficient for the power sector to earn 8% rate of return on its net assets in operation&#13;
(hereafter "RRA") every year, subject to the RRA being adequate to achieve a debt&#13;
service ratio of at least 1.5, a self-financing ratio of at least 0.2 and an operating ratio of&#13;
less than 0.85, all terms as defined below and according to the following procedure.&#13;
2.    Every November, GOCI will prepare a power system investment, operation and&#13;
financial performance forecast in a manner satisfactory to IDA using the current "base&#13;
tariff" in order to determine the tariff sufficient to achieve the adequate RRA (hereafter&#13;
"the sufficient tariff'). The effective base tariff for November 1995 is FCFA 57.3/kWh.&#13;
3.    The tariff will be adjusted to achieve the adequate RRA if the sufficient tariff is at&#13;
least 5% above or 10% below the base tariff. The adjusted tariff will be the base tariff for&#13;
purposes of each November's tariff assessment.&#13;
Definitions:&#13;
"RRA" (Rate of Return on ANFA) = operating income/ANFA.&#13;
ANFA = Average net fixed assets, defined as one half of the sum of the sector's (non-&#13;
CIPREL) fixed assets in operation at the beginning and at the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
Operating Income = revenue minus operating expenditures.&#13;
Revenue = proceeds of domestic and export electricity sales from CIE to FNEE, and the&#13;
rural electrification fee paid into FNEE.&#13;
Operating expenditures = Fees and expenses paid to CIE, CIPREL, EECI and DCGTx,&#13;
electricity imports, the commercial cost of fuel supply to CIE and CIPREL, depreciation&#13;
and net payment of value-added tax.&#13;
Annual debt-service coverage ratio = operating income plus depreciation both divided&#13;
by net debt service.&#13;
Net Debt Service = the year's projected payment of principal and interest on all of the&#13;
sector's net debt.&#13;
Self-financing ratio = internal funds available for investment divided by total investment.&#13;
Internal Funds available for investment = operating income plus depreciation minus the&#13;
sum of changes in working capital, interest and debt service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Irvesment - construction plus interest during construction.&#13;
Operating ratio = operating expenditures divided by revenue.&#13;
A sample accounting format is provided on page 3 of this Annex. Data is subject to&#13;
change.&#13;
Specific Provisions for 1995/1996&#13;
Book value of assets will be used instead of revalued assets until asset revaluation is&#13;
completed as pan of the forthcoming tariff study. Asset revaluation will be done under the&#13;
project so that RRA can be computed on the basis of net revalued assets, defined as non-&#13;
CIPREL, non-CIE operable assets in current value net of accumulated revalued&#13;
depreciation.&#13;
External debt service is a working estimate agreed between GOCI and the IMF, and it will&#13;
be used pending a review and specification of external power sector debt service to be&#13;
conducted as part of the tariff study.&#13;
The first application of the formula for 1995/1996 will be in November 1995.&#13;

for which the capacity is available; e.g. 0.548 means 54.8% of the hours of the year. The&#13;
availability of the steam plant assumes no further rehabilitation work.&#13;

            The Private Sector Energy Project will:
            (A) continue the restructuring of power sector institutions
            begun under the Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (ESAL),
            particularly and appropriate regulatory framework and
            strengthening institutional capabilities, thus enabling the
            development of competitive and expanded private sector
            participation; (b) improve power supply reliability, reduce
            environmental impacts and reduce the cost of electricity by
            supporting efficient gas-fired capacity using indigenous
            natural gas developed under a private sector
            Build-Own-Operate Transfer (BOOT) arrangement; and (c)
            enhance operational reliability and efficiency through
            reinforcement and improvement of the transmission system.
